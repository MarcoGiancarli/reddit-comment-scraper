PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,xPaffDaddyx,2,Wed Jul 15 12:54:08 2015 UTC,pitch?
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Cornelisatorus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:52:39 2015 UTC,He's asking if you have binded 'pitch up/down' buttons somehow. If you have different lang version those are controls by default binded to up and down keys on your keyboard and they control nose up and down movement.  Those are useful binds as you can easily move in that axis with max speed and not rely on mouse movement.
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow what?? No, I'm not even aware that existed, I use my mouse for everything basicly.  EDIT: inb4 Libscrub."
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:36 2015 UTC,"Those keys are useful for many occasions, especially if enemies goes pass you. You can turn with max speed allowed by game. That also let you tone down sensitivity a bit for better aiming as you don't have to rely on mouse for mobility. But that is very personal setting.  Other bind that can be useful is Throttle (analog) - unbinded by default. It does similar effect to normal throttle (binded under 'S') but makes you stop to 0 speed after one click instead of slowing down progressively. I don't know numbers here but many guys advised it to me so i've just binded it over to S.    Funny side effect is that you cannot land after using it and you have to press 'W' right before touching the ground or plane will bounce off :D"
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Daikar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"binding analog throttle to ""S"" is a bad advice imao .i continiously hold the normal breaks while hoverfighting so for me its better to have analog throttle bound to something close by, ""E"" for example, and keep the normal breaks bound to ""S"". I use analogthrottle ruffly every 2-5 seconds and the normal breaks are engaged pretty much troughout the whole hoverfight."

PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"I agree on the OP part but having it removed just makes it worse, an in game player created pilot guide would be a lot better.

PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:42:13 2015 UTC,you have to see that there are also a lot of players like me who dont even have thumb buttons. And getting that big of an advantage just becouse of gear is kinda meh but i guess thats just pc gaming.

PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"you don't need to have it on your thumb buttons, although it is the best place. And getting an advantage with better gear is kinda what PC gaming is, more fps = more kills. We cant start limiting hardware so that everyone is playing on the same hardware, that would be stupid.... consoles.  And besides what kind of mouse sold today doesn't have thumb buttons?"
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Cornelisatorus,0,Wed Jul 15 21:10:06 2015 UTC,its actually a razer mouse :P  My Deathadder broke and i didnt had the bucks to spend on a good razer mouse again but since i really got familar with the brand and trusted them i just got the cheapest of theyre mice and i have to say besides not having thumb buttons that mouse is perfect for me.
PS2Cobalt,3ddejn,Ometen,0,Thu Jul 16 11:16:53 2015 UTC,i know its the nature of pc gaming but still its a verry small minority of players actually using those keybinds and gaining a big advantage over those who are not using them. Removing those binds would make the skillgap between players much smaller and the fights MUCH more interresting becouse they last a little bit longer.   Aaaah to everyone who is not understanding and not beliving that it actually makes a difference. Just watch a few montages and try to figure out wich method of pitching they use.  Hint. Players who are piching manually by dragging the mouse have really hard time aiming and a really unsteady picture but those guys who have bound it to mousebuttons or whatever have extremly percice aim even on distance and a really smooth and stable image overall. Now have fun and watch a few pilots and judge by yourself.

Result: Downvotes in this subreddit are made without any reasons related to the video content. (Surprise!) Here are the funny stats: The video that i linked here for that experiment was exactly 6 months old, had 160 views, 11 thumbs up, 0 thumbs down before i linked it here (where it belongs, because it's a COBALT video). Today it has 340 views, 18x up, 7x down.  So: Cobalt reddit link = 180 views, 7x down, 7x up. No Cobalt reddit link = 160 views, zero down, 11 up. You say you ""didn't like the previous videos"".

Personally i don't give a shit about this drama crap. You took part in it in the past but that's not my concern.  About the videos: Your stuff is not my thing, the montages are very chaotic and too long for that matter. Some very good stuff and then you have to wait quite a while for the next good one and it's totally random. And the raw gameplay stuff is very casual. Some videos are supposed to be funny and it's just not my humor.  This video i felt was alright because you kept it short. But the content is so much c4 in every video. I made one c4 montage and that's it. If you make a c4 montage name it c4 montage. It's getting old after a while."

PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,elbifo,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:14 2015 UTC,easy to say when playing the easymode faction that never gets nerfed because it's playerbase is mostly horrible.
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,shurriken,5,Mon Jul 13 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"i played other game before where the balance was arguable, for the state of the game, put your ego aside , be impatial and look at the game, some shit need some balance, i did not start that, DBG did, but whiner on forum/reddit delay the patch, a classic in a lot of game, too bad DBG listen to sissies instead of numbers."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,elbifo,-3,Tue Jul 14 06:48:56 2015 UTC,too bad DBG listen to sissies instead of numbers.   the reason why vanu is getting nerfed since launch. sissies that cry because they're bad.
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,shurriken,5,Tue Jul 14 07:04:42 2015 UTC,this is actually the reason why VS avoided nerfs since launch   DBG listen to sissies instead of [combat stats] numbers   remember when they balance MBT's and VS effectively refused to use it at all - which IIRC did lead to some further adjustments in VS's favor  it was pretty much the same deal with the VS max ability - i don't actually remember a time when TR or NC players behaved this way and actually a PS2 dev's made a poignant statement saying VS are weird and annoying to balance due to this behavior  it's a sufficiently widespread attitude of VS players that it has had an effect on game balance - a notable example would be to make the comparison of when TR had their default LMG nerfed ye the VS retained an advantage in that area for much longer  it's actually quite fun for me to discuss balance changes - because i do eventually get validated by the updates. I don't want to claim that i've have an effect on game balance (i simply do not contribute on forums enough) but it is very satisfying to see changes that are in line with my personal assessment of the game balance issues
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,Kbnation,0,Tue Jul 14 11:53:02 2015 UTC,"If by validated you mean the devs adress the issues you see as problems, well that's something many others can claim. It's not hard to see those issues when you play the game a fair amount.  If you mean they also take the same action as you, well i hope you didn't support these following changes.   ZOE Nerf   Overnerfed, now never seen. Needed the nerf, but should have had a decent use after as well. Charge is a straight up upgrade in 99% of situations.   Harrasser Nerf/Vulcan Nerf   Everyone saw it coming, but all it needed was to address the Harrassers rep ability and a slight nerf to the Vulcan. Instead these were both useless for a long time until they were buffed again.   Lib-Update   I've not met anyone that thought this was a good idea, or even needed. Everyone hated it, the 3-shot kills on libs was pointless and only had one effect, made lib vs lib less fun.   AV Nade Nerf   Needed it, but over nerfed with a ridiculously small radius and require LOS on the max you want to kill. I suppose you also thought that the real focus should have been on changing the Air Vehicle resists to AV nades like DBG did?   Spawn Beacon Nerf   Yay, nerf teamplay for small groups and playing with friends. Thanks DBG   Vehicle Gravity and .75 Changes   Both didn't make it to live (yet) but were supported by dev. The vehicle change was hated and very little support and still took a long time and several PTS sessions until they finally accepted it.   Striker Nerf   Over-nerfed. Like a lot of people said, needed a long time before DBG came back to it.    Most stuff there needed balancing, but none of it was done well, look at all the stuff that they nerf, only to have to come back in 6 months and buff it. To say you feel vindicated by DBG/SOE seems very strange when their process seems inherently flawed with the amount of miss-steps they make. The only major change/rework i can thing of that worked well was the PPA change, and that still took over-nerf and buffing it.  The reason most people complain about DBG's .75 nerf is because it will be put in that list. It's not thought out and offers nothing to those guns that lose the only thing making them useful. If you take .75 have a plan for what you do to those weapons so they still have a use.   The reason VS are hard to balance is because their ""OP"" stuff is based around mobility. That's hard to balance. The Mag for example, if it can get on those hills it's OP, if it can't get on these Hills it is the worst tank in the game. Same with ZOE, fast MAX was OP, a MAX that only goes a little bit faster some of the time, is just a shit charge."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,BlckJck103,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"Charge is a straight up upgrade in 99% of situations   Sounds familiar.   [re; harasser nerf] ...   Ye i was talking baout the 'best tank in game' effect due to survivability. I don't really care about the vulcan.   Everything else listed   I shouldn't have to point out that i don't comment on every aspect of game balance. When something is changed that i had an opinion on how could i feel anything other than validation? - the implication (if it would need spelling out) is that the things i have chosen to comment on usually get changed.  I did also remark on how the PS2 project has been mismanaged all over the shop. There's really no need to tell me things i already know. Edit; it's a rather transparent way for you to evoke doubt in the competency of the dev team. Why would i disagree? It certainly has no bearing on how many times i've felt an obvious imbalance should be corrected and then seen it implemented. In fact it kinda supports the position that balance issues are prevalent and go unchanged.  /nomoreedit   [re; orion] It's not thought out and offers nothing to those guns that lose the only thing making them useful.   Don't be ridiculous. If you're going to make that claim then at least support it with something... (anything) other than opinion. Your comment about MBT mobility is naive at best - this story goes deeper than hill climbing and mobility includes; collisions with ally units, top speed, acceleration, turning circle, a variety of turret up conditions become simple......... and the core trait of magriders which is dodging fire.  do i really need to detail explicity how much you dumbed down the scope of 'balacing mobility' by only referencing hillclimbing."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,Kbnation,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:59:57 2015 UTC,apparantly turret up is actually called hull down
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,Kbnation,0,Wed Jul 15 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"Well where would you use ZOE over charge now? ZOE is only good for kiting NC maxes or if you're going AV with comets. These situations are about 1% i think?. Even in some of those situations the mobility from charge far exceeds ZOE and can sometimes still be a better choice.  I didn't say that PS2 has mismanaged all over, I think that they do their best, I also think that balancing issues have probably been low of their priority list. They have some great ideas and they bring good things in and they actually often get things to the right place. But their initial nerfs are consistently too far and need to be scaled back, which takes far too long.  It comes across as so ostentatious when you claim that the issues you target are often hit. Wow, you mean you've identified that ZOE needed a nerf? Most of the stuff on that list would be honest to every BR100. I'm not saying they would all agree, but it's far from a a unique trait to be able to identify the OP.    Don't be ridiculous. If you're going to make that claim then at least support it with something... (anything) other than opinion.   The Orion would have the slowest muzzle velocity of all LMGs by 60m/s @ 540m/s. The rest of VS LMGs have between 600 & 640 m/s. So for some reason the Orion needs that huge difference which is 150% of any other two. It will also have the smallest mag size @ 50 and the SVA and Polaris will both have lower FSM. Compared to the MSW also with 50 rounds at 143 it has a slower Short and Long Reload, it will have the same RoF as the MSW. The only thing that the Orion will have is a slightly better (0.25) hipfire compared to the Anchor and MSW. But, the MSW and Anchor have access to ALS and the Orion doesn't. So even in hipfire, it won't be better that the others.   The only reason you would use the Orion after the nerf is because it has 750 RPM, and the other options only have 700. But you trade muzzle velocity, ammo capacity and FSM for that. Against the other factions, it's an MSW-R but worse or equal in every aspect, same RoF, same ammo, slower reload, slower muzzle velocity, higher Verticle recoil (although better pattern). The Orion will have better base hipfire, but no ALS, so they'll be equal in hipfire as well and better horizontal recoil by a whole 0.05.  Tell me do you think having 750rpm is a good enough reason to use that Orion post nerf? And even if you do, you straight up worse than the MSW.   Onto the mag I think being as you asked me to explain a public post that you could look up yourself (orion changes) then you could explain how you balance the Magrider. I didn't try and dumb it down, i tried to point out as quickly as possible at 2am how mobility is hard to balance, it often comes down to a simple, can it do it? If the magrider can't move quickly it's hull-mounted turret is really fucking bad, if it can move fast the hull is too strong. Dodging fire at long range is neither here nor there imo. If you're dying in a tank over 400m you're doing something wrong, at closer ranges yeah it's really good, and really fun. But it's often down to skill, when i used to tank a lot, i was never able to dodge the best VG drivers with great success at close range. They knew what to do and made it a lot harder, even the worst VG driver however can press F to mitigate 2000 damage though. I'm not saying VG shield is OP, but if you think the ability to dodge is OP, then surely the ability to press F and not have to dodge is 10x worse?  Like everything else, I'm not saying that there's no possible balance to do but i don't see it as a very high priority because to be i don't see any major problems."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,BlckJck103,0,Wed Jul 15 10:00:35 2015 UTC,You misunderstood a few things (everything? ... is it deliberately?). I can appreciate that you've been having balance discussions with some of the most deluded members of VS.   So i forgive you for that. Considering the propensity toward bias in your situation you might want to actually go the distance and break out the excel to table shit up.  If you do table the various qualities properly... then you'll notice that the movement speed aspect of the Orion is an additional extra within the scope of LMG balance! The TR and NC faction traits equate directly into statistics that are balanced with the VS stats except the movement speed.  Why is this?  This is because the NC get 0.75 on a medic weapon ...whoah... But the single most important discussion point here is that VS shouldn't have it on HA. Nobody should have it on HA unless everybody does (NS-15M). It's because of the strength of the HA class that the 0.75 movement speed is OP.  It's about the way the game plays. And the various implementations of 'imperfect balance' to create a compelling situation (please note; giving the factions a flavor detracts from perfect balance and this is intentional).  Your perspective on this 0.75 movement speed thing is pretty cloudy... you've done a qualitative analysis of VS LMGs. This has no implications on the balance between factions. And you didn't address the point about how the 0.75 movement speed was initially implemented across factions but more importantly how it was implemented in the infantry classes following the design paradigm of 'imperfect balance'.  Yes i am pointing out that the initial implementation of the Orion was intentionally unbalanced.  I'd also like to point out that the NC LMG you use in comparison wasn't even released with the live game and was added some months after. I suspect that this was added because players did not appropriately value the (very similar) 50 cert GD-22 and too many players were not picking it up.  You might say that releasing a weapon does nothing for newbies... but you'd be ignoring the effect of word of mouth / forum posts / generally the way people actually behave.  So that was a bit long winded but i think it's important to explain why i disagree with your qualitative analysis of the LMGs. It's important to remain unbiased and un-opinionated so that you have the clarity and scope to include everything in the equation.  It's irritates me that people try to address the 0.75 movement speed balance but never talk about the classes that are assigned these weapons for each faction. Clearly the VS getting 0.75 option on HA class is pretty powerful... and that's irrespective of the fact that the 0.75 was on a default gun.  I formed my opinion of this topic when i was learning the game back in early 2013. I lost to the same random VS heavy a few times in a row and wanted to unlock a 0.75 movement speed LMG on NC to compete. Obviously there wasn't an option.  continued in a self-reply
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,Kbnation,0,Wed Jul 15 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"[re; max charge]   I quoted your comment on charge because i consider it to be the best ability. Charge. I never use anything else. This is why i said it 'sounds familiar'... because i tell other people that i prefer charge and never use the NC shield. I don't understand why you think ZOE ability should be better than charge when NC and TR also prefer to use charge due to their faction abilities being highly situational at best.  This next bit is also core to the topic you raised. ZOE is not the same flavor of ability. If i leave my NC shield active i cannot shoot. If TR max stays deployed it cannot move. ZOE can remain active and benefits multiple facets of this (force multiplier) unit... therefore ZOE is not so much a situational ability but rather a pure combat buff. The trade of in terms of damage mitigation does not provide a sufficient 'situational' advantage compared with NC not being able to shoot and TR not being able to move (when their abilities are active).  If you want my honest opinion there should be no confusion between charge and ZOE. I do not think it is appropriate to give ZOE increased movement speed. This removes any confusion and allows players to make a 'hands down' decision over which ability is most useful in combat.  It's charge.   I didn't say that PS2 has mismanaged all over   No, you didn't say it at all... i said it. But i made that comment because you don't acknowledge the reason for drawing doubt on their game balance changes. There is no other reason why you would list off a bunch of badly executed balance changes other than to imply that the dev's are useless.  This is a common behavior and you may not be aware of what you're doing. You are attempting to validate your position by deriding the capability of the dev team in balance changes. I'm not going to disagree - but i am going to point out that it doesn't make your opinion more valid.   Ostentatious   So what? - that has no bearing whatsoever of the accuracy or applicability of my statement. Ask anyone... i don't care what other people think about me or my opinions... it's a redundant point and lacks substance.   Wow, you mean you've identified that ZOE needed a nerf?   Are you trying to start a pissing contest? Clearly you got a bit riled up... but don't write a letter when you're angry (or motivated by it). How do you expect me to respond to this sarcastic and belittling comment which is out of context.  To me it 's like you're trying to put words and opinions into my mouth. I'm not going to adopt a stance on something or even explain my stance on a game balance issue if you're going to shit post with lashings of sarcasm and **clearly biased statements that account to no more than 'a fancy way of saying STFU'.   Tell me do you think having 750rpm is a good enough reason to use that Orion post nerf? And even if you do, you straight up worse than the MSW   Tell me do you think the Gauss SAW was an acceptable starter LMG for NC players? This is not a comparison between LMGs... pay attention... my point here is that the game is balanced with imbalances built into that equation. The movement speed is purely an extra when comparing the HA class across factions.  I don't give a shit what your options are and the reasoning you give for your opinion. Opinion doesn't matter when we're talking about balance. Balance is quantifiable. It's an equation. And we already know that it's deliberately a rough balance.    Look Blackjack... do you actually have something to talk about or did you just wanna bitch at me for expressing my opinions?  So far nothing you've said has been productive. It seems like your reaction is the result of some bitching on TS where people rub their delicate egos and pretend that one (or both) other faction(s) of players are mentally handicapped.  A top for avoiding this situation; don't insult my intelligence by constructing rhetoric that is founded on discrediting my opinion. This is just tabloid sensationalism at best - and i can only assume that somebody is hoping i'll fuck up and embarrass myself by stating something inaccurately or... whatever. This doesn't work on me.   [re; magrider mobility and game balance] I didn't try and dumb it down, i tried to point out as quickly as possible at 2am how mobility is hard to balance   You didn't even try to. Come on don't act like i don't see what you're doing. Deliberately focus the conversation on viability and then claim that the hillclimbing was a core trait.  No. Honestly Blackjack i have lost some respect for you here because of the level of retardation in the direction you went here. You're trying to validate an exploitative situation as being something that was intended to contribute toward game balance.  Let me just restate that.  Players discovered something that the dev's said was not meant to function that way. Dev's change it and VS players cry because they insist that it was key to the balance. Stop being ridiculous. You might as well argue that the C4 exploit which crashed hexes was a legitimate part of game strategy. I'm sure we'll see that tactic employed competitively /sarcasm.   Dodging fire at long range is neither here nor there imo   If you ask anybody to list the maggys key features then the most prominent characteristic mentioned would be this one. And you just said it's ""neither here nor there"". Are you serious? Don't mistake this for a complaint about the characteristic. It is a complaint about how you're dumbing it down again. I also disagree with some of the other things you mention about the magrider; i don't think making it faster has much effect since i can aim and faster in one direction just means i lead more (just to provide an example).   If you're dying in a tank over 400m you're doing something wrong, at closer ranges yeah it's really good, and really fun. But it's often down to skill, when i used to tank a lot, i was never able to dodge the best VG drivers with great success at close range.   Wanted to draw your attention to your own comment here. If you're dying in a tank over 400m you're doing something wrong. And then you follow it up with this; i was never able to dodge the best VG drivers with great success at close range and this; even the worst VG driver however can press F to mitigate 2000 damage though.  Just pay attention to the bias in what you said have said here.    You have told me that MBT's shouldn't die at range unless you've fucked up... (however, this is an optimal range for engagement and practically everything i kill at this range did not stand a chance) You then detail the advantages of the  VG and how the shield is so strong in close quarters... i do not disagree... however... You ignore the fact that the difference in mobility often prevents the VG from approaching. This is an advantage that you ignore because mobility is a complicated aspect to balance and discerning between skill and inherent advantage at the optimal engagement range is ... well frankly impossible. I wouldn't say there was a difference in skill between 'pressing VG shield after managing to creep up on a mo-fucker' and 'sitting at optimal range whilst slowly circle strafing around to avoid incoming fire'. Don't pretend to me that there's any skill involved there. But you go on to claim that to balance the shield - VS need hill climbing. In your scenario the magrider is never vulnerable. You can't have the cake and eat it. It is ridiculous to claim an exploitative behavior is critical to game balance. It is the pure definition of discovering a nice tasty cake and then exploiting the shit out of it (amusing analogy failure).   And don't get tempted to chide me for being short with you. You have insulted my intelligence with your shit post. I expected better. Something that makes these discussion particularly enjoyable with FOOLs is that you guys seem to work each other into a delusional frenzy and don't notice the aspects that you haven't included in your balance assessment.  This is why bias needs to be left at the door every time you discuss balance seriously. People have an uncanny ability to lie to themselves. Being confronted with ideology that conflicts with you established views also creates a biological reaction and drains blood from the part of you brain responsible for rational thought.  I'm not saying any of this to try and belittle you. I'm diminishing your opinion specifically by pointing out the flaws in logic / things you may have subconsciously ignored (or simply not considered). And it's very easy for me because i have heard every one of these arguments before - i've considered them - and i've looked further until finding the source of imbalance. Many times these imbalances are clear example of how the PS2 project was mismanaged."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,Kbnation,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the Liberator. While i don't consider A2A libs a problem or something to cry about. I do think they could use some heavy rework to further define them as A2G gunships.  First of all rework of armor values. Reduce resistance values on the top/back and build them up at the  front and bottom. Let the liberator get stronger in it's AI and AV role as long as it's willing to risk more than it does now.  With the hefty increase in underbelly and front armor the liberator will be far more tanky as long as willing to get closer to the action. It will be able to tankbust with more freedom and hover over target area for longer periods of time. The decrease in rear armor will meen that while an approach and operating directly above enemies might become far easier, leaving the AO safely will become a challange. The underbelly armor changes will result in Liberators having the ability to hover and eat more decimators so they'll require some ""tweaking""(kek) to force them into range requirements where they are more likely to eat more decimator shots than they do now. My benchmark for belly gun performance is duster because it's the one that that requires most risk for same reward. It's the anti cheese to your daltoncheese.  On Zepher. Reduce the effective thermals range to that of Valkyrie/Duster. Forcing lib crews either rely on zoom optics and visual identification or come a bit lower where more people can reach out and touch them. Nerf further if stands out too much.  On Dalton. Reduce the velocity to that of a duster. But give an massive increase in damage. At least 25% to 35% per shot. Making the dalton worthless in A2A but making it amazing against vehicles caught directly underneath it. Specifically the slow ones like TR/NC MBT's & Sunderers.  On Duster. Slight increase in splash or nothing at all. It is as close to perfect as anything in planetside has ever gotten.  On Shredder. Nerf if people start using it."
PS2Cobalt,3d56mm,RetOld,0,Wed Jul 15 09:48:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind Lib changes, But why touch A2A dalton? Even when everyone was doing it, it wasn't a problem. They nerfed the velocity to make it less so, fair enough. BUt the 3shot kill on libs was just a fuck you to people who liked lib vs lib. now you go down to 10% fire supress and run. It single-handedly killed something unique about the game. That was a hook that would have kept getting people interested if they left it in.  A2A dalton (with no-splash and the nerfed velocity) effected nobody but other people flying, and was no more effective that 2 people in ESF's really. It was just more fun."

As long as he's not killing anyone IRL with their own panties there isn't conflict of interest between him and us.  He hasn't been online in a over couple of months but we still maintain him in the role of outfit represenetative to our enemies. Because he's perfect for the job.

Serious problems like missiles not connecting with enemy aircraft.

Come, advocate an alternative where A2Am take some sort of skill. I will support you.   You trying to prevent, shame and insult people for advocating alternative.   Why would I not try to prevent the use of ez mod weapons?"
PS2Cobalt,3cyhfm,-Imwiththatguy,0,Sun Jul 12 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"There is no A2AM meta unless they are tweaked to have a learning curve too.   I disagree out of principle on both statements.   Proper use of tomcats requires in the least understanding of rudementary aspects of air combat in PS2.   The meta comes from the tug & pull gameplay and specialisation for particular narrow field scenarios rather than raw skill potential. Right airframe for the weapon set with right utility and defensive slots. I do not think the meta is in the right place yet but it's getting there!.   Come, advocate an alternative where A2Am take some sort of skill. I will support you.   So here's the Eugene's solutions page as per your request. Note that my opinion on game does not equate ""skill = balance"". I don't care for skill in the slightest, more so my emphesis has always been how well something fills up a very particular role. If i'd care about skill as something by which to rate gameplay then everyone would be forced to use battlerifles.  So let's dive into the topic.  A2AM's. Decrease of 10-15% in damage per missile. Decrease in ammo capacity by four missiles to a total capacity of 6. Any more and they loose all semblance of usefulness as air superiority weapon that is supose to stay in near equal equibilibrium with noseguns. You can disagree with this notion all you want by my worldview states that a vehicle designed specifically for killling it's own type should have 40% or above killing power against a similar vehicle designed for another task. With or without skill. I think tomcats and coyotes fill up the 40-50% increase in killing power almost perfectly with a bit of inbalance in their favor.   I'd also consider after initial changes to have an ""arming time"" on tomcats. Basically innability to lock stuff at 150 meters and below range. But extended the maximum lock range by 50 meters. It would further define their role for long range sniping while giving CQC pilots a chance to even the odds as long as they get within the brawling range.  I rate the aircraft by their roles below. Note that i don't consider Nosegun/AB as a valid air superiority platform but something similar to multirole fighter and a scout aircraft. it's the Mig29 when put in comparison to MIG-31. Basically you're comparing your chiwawa of an ESF to a volkodav one that's been bred to bite in and rip out jugulars.  Nosegun/AB ESF = Light Scout and interceptor aircraft.   Nosegun/Tomcats = Heavy Standoff A2A platform.   Nosegun/Coyotes = Heavy Interceptor A2A platform.    So here's the fun part of my solution to the airmeta problem.   I'd buff the composite armor against tomcats. Providing the ESF with kinetic protection that would soak up 1 to 1.5 missiles worth of damage. With the previously mentioned decrease in damage of 10/15% that we spoke of and reduction in missile capacity would meen that a player could in combination with flares build an effective counter to tomcats but obviously at expense elsewhere.   I'm loving the fact that stealth is broken and completely negates coyotes right now. While it might not be intentional but that's a level of specialisation only i could come up with. Increases the tomcats lock by 1 second while negating the coyotes completely. With flares it makes for a damn fine scout/interceptor for soloshitters. It negates one weapon completely and heavily penalises the other one while relying on soft kill and ECM measures. Brilliant.  Other thing i'd change is remove the ejection seat that nobody uses and replace it with dedicated ECM/EMP generator. Every few minutes for duration of 30 seconds within 600 meter you could drain AB tanks, stop tomcats/coyotes from working and within tradition of grenade based emp static up and remove the HUD/IFF identifiers from enemy aircraft. Would work perfectly in combination with engagement radar as it would give you direct information when someone is in the ""kill range"". The ECM duration and refire time would increase by vehicle size basically. A dedicated valkyrie in the mix could do it every 90 seconds a battle galaxy every 60 seconds. But i'm going bit off topic and all the changes to other forms of aircraft would fallow similar pattern. On how they synergize with other elements/vehicles in the game.  For noseguns. Retain current damage and reload profile for all guns.   Decrease stock nosegun accuracy to effective range of 180-220 meters to put them between rotaries and kestrels. at the same time increase kestrel accuracy to provide low damage long range well defined role for them. Retain rotaries as is.  Thats my concept of weapon balance cooked up in less than 10 minutes. At least it's something more than i'm hearing from skyknight community which calls for blanket nerfs because ""skill"" while they  without any sense of irony ruthlessly lolpod, dalton and zepher clueless ground fucks who half of the time have absolutely no ability to counter them when in field.  I'd also do stuff like remove resource gain while outside of own territory, reintroduce vehicle timers with non certable timer that is same for everyone and make it so that timer starts counting down only after you loose your aircraft so that people wouldn't be pulling shit for each other to do stuff together when they'd get killed. Would clear that little lightassault shittery right in an instant too."

PS2Cobalt,3cwnbl,killALLilluminati,-2,Sat Jul 11 12:29:21 2015 UTC,It's a bug obviously after he lagged out. 99.9% of time when you can maintain lock means that missiles will connect unless something gets infront of them.   If you keep the other aircraft at around the edge of effective range of tomcats you can effectively fire them without loosing lock.   Simply explained game engine breaks lock on impact of A2AM unless another tomcat has been fire before impact is achieved in which case the lockbreak feature on impact is shifted on to the next missile. As long as you can fire missiles before the last one connects with the aircraft you can skip the reload cycle completely past the first missile. This is what makes them so dangerous and this is why i'd advice people to actually turn and fight.   You got two options either to loose with dignity or get hunted down like a mangy mutts that you are.  As you can see for me using tomcats is also pure joy of an experiance. Nothing is more satifying in planetside than the adrenaline rush of mouse 1.

That doesn't make it fair or right to use it. Fact is - if I used it, you would not be able to get outta warpgate. Another fact - you're only flying because there are pilots who don't find any fun or challenge in lock ons. If top pilots started using lock ons - you can say bye bye to having any airgame of your own.   It's like having a battle rifle on you HA, going against NS-15 HA, loosing and complaining that he's using NS-15.   Not really seeing the relevance to locks.

They do. Tests have already been done, when one of two equally skilled pilot would start winning easily with lock ons against the other one. The thing is - you can dodge enemy bullets quite good with no afterburner at all (personal experience of course).  Again, good pilots don't use locks because it's stupidly easy in a2a. Because if they DID use it, they would a) never become good pilots, b) they can't use it, because it would go against the effort they put into flying...  Anyway, i don't like bailing or farming.

PS2Cobalt,3cwnbl,Cornelisatorus,0,Sat Jul 11 18:05:40 2015 UTC,"Saying A2A locks are OP is like saying HA shield is op.  It's a pointless argument because you can't prove it in the general sense.  The entire issue rests on the game designers aims. For example, if infantry classes are meant to be equal and only have small differences in utility (ie a perfect squad has 2 of each class) then HA shield is OP. Yet if Heavies are meant to be a ""Main"" infantry class with the rest supporting it then it isn't OP. There's no correct answer, its just opinion on what the game should be like.   Same with locks. You say they're OP and that's you're opinion, fair enough. But it's only an opinion based on balancing the game to what you like about it.  I saw that video when Bequ made it. If DBG want the place of A2A lock-ons to be king of A2A ESF's then that video shows nothing. Bequ could no doubt shoot down a load of ESFs using Banshee, should it then be nerfed?  Argue that the air game is better, more vibrant and more fun for veteran and new players with a nosegun focused system, use that video to show not how ""OP"" it is but about how boring it is in the long run for pilots and thus, hurts the longevity of the game when A2A Locks are the pinnacle."

It doesn't put him on the same level as another person who's invested more time into flying. This is a false statement on your part and you know it.  Ever completely shat on an incompetent tomcat/coyotes user? I'm absolutely shit pilot and i've done that numerous times. I've also had engagements where i've got the first and second tomcat on target and still lost at the end. It happens, good pilots will shrek you tomcats or no tomcats in 1v1. So the weapon alone does not provide a massive increase in capability within average engagement range against non equal in skill participants.   It does provide a clear advantage against equal skilled pilot who does not use tomcats though. But i'll elaborate on that billow in this post.   Do you think this is how it works in real world?   This isn't real world and this isn't even a simulator type game (IL2, DCS, Arma series). Just the fact that you're insulting people here for their playstyle without fear of getting your jaw restructured is a prove enough. Online people do and say things they wouldn't do in or even think of doing in real world. Different rules apply to each environment.   What would you say if it was allowed for bad sprinters to start in half of the race while good sprinters start at the beginning? Bad sprinters would still lose with a small chance of winning. Would that be fair?   No it wouldn't be fair but your example is flawed. You are talking about athetes in a astablished sports field with knockout tournament system and brackets. In fps it would be competative Counter Strike for example.  What you see on Live is equivilent of you participating in a no rules streetfighting against a doughboy fatty in one instance and getting your head caved in by Bas Rutten in another. You might be elbowing Stephen Hawking in the temple and then get sucker punched by Mohammed Ali in his fucking prime in the next.  Spare me your notion of honor that non of you ace piltus actually have. You play on live and enjoy flying in PS2 not because it's competative but because it is not. You enjoy destroying people worse than you and racking up victories against people who lack the skill, talent, time and effort to get on your level. Level that majority of server and players participating in PS2 simply do not simply care about.   Not really seeing the relevance to locks.   Coyotes and Tomcats are 100% identical across factions. They disregard the size of the aircraft, it's hitbox curiosities, the speed, the angle of maneuver and all other factors. They are the most fair weapons in game against equally equiped aircraft.   They remove the notion of skill and bring back the notion of duel at it's core. As you know the most fair and respected of the dueling forms is among gentlemen with the flintlock dueling pistols. Pistols which were designed to be identical and innacurate from the start as duel has always had connotation of propability of equal outcome rather than skill involved. Same pistols were the ultimate show of fair play as they could put individuals of different size, strenght and age on completely equal footing.  It was about people putting their lives on the line for honor and nothing is more honorable than giving a person who lacks physical strenght, skill or talent to earn his honor back fairly. You my friend are a barbarian pillager while people like me who use tomcats are dapper gentlemen. Educate yourself and become a man of honor rather than skillful brute.   Bad understanding of balance. Giving one a weapon to kill players 20 times better with almost no downsides (in the same level of environment) is not balance.   Giving ANYONE ability for anyone to have the same weapon is not the same as giving them ability to kill a better player with a weapon that the better player has no access to. If you want to criple yourself by not having tomcats it's your khall.   The tomcat users are not using cruches as many pilots note. The tomcat users are the fully funcitioning well rounded inviduals while skyknights are the neanderthals who cannot overcome the fact that their time is over and that they cannot stop us. They cannot stop the future.   Lock-ons are a legitimate cheat, that's what it is.   You have as much access to them as every single player who has ever played and plays planetside 2.   Your unwillingness not to join the top gun topcat tomcatters is your own downfall and calling them a cheat is your saltiness of being a dying breed.

In a game mode that is completely open and has absolutely no rules of coduct.  They'll also jump you, one clip you without mercy, if in trouble call out for backup and often enough disregard their own values and rationalize my sort of behavior that i advocate for because they've only done it ""once or twice"" then come and argue against it on reddit.

Honor in traditional sense is something completely different and something that people were willing to kill each other over in the past.

To all dedicated pilots, who are you to insult a guy (a big troll also) which doesn't play as you want ? There is no rule or dictatorship here. In a war if your ennemy want to beat you with ,weapon you dont like he will do.  That ruin the game yes, but why not trying to convince him nicely to train and improve without lockon ?"
PS2Cobalt,3cwnbl,Yessme,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:01:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, your opinion is fairly decently put together and you're at least open minded and understanding of my views.  Here's the kicker. When ever i'm flying solo i'm almost always flying nosegun only and i don't mind in the slightest when i get killed by any type of pilot i encounter. Be it ace pilot one clipping me, being jumped by airsquad or eating tomcats. Because i'm playing on live i'm complete at terms that i can run into anyone and anything and there is no point crying over it. That's live for you.  Reason being that i do value effort put into training and consider being proficient to at least some degree with each weapon is a good thing. It's specialisation and wide variety of forms of approach that i advocate for.   I don't consider tomcats to be overpowered in the slightest though in the grand scheme of things. With a bit of forethought, specialisation and skill they're fairly easy to overcome against even somewhat of a weaker pilot. I see flares and stealth frame being used effectively as often as i see Santa. Never.  Maybe in higher brackets of skill it's different but against lowly fucks like myself i've never seen better pilots strugle that much. Not in 1v1 that's for sure.  They are very deep specialisation tool. They are meant to improve your performance considerably in one specific area at expense of everything else. I think they execute it very well. They've got their weaknesses that can be exploited likewise. Weaknesses that require you to adopt to a different flying style, different airframe and operate outside of your comfort zone. Something that pilots rarely do.  To me pulling tomcats/nosegun is no different than pulling AP/AP MBT. Complaining about tomcats is no different than going with HEAT/Basilisk MBT against AP/AP and complaining that it's unfair that a vehicle that has been build up and certed for killing only armor performs better at that specific role than your mixed role MBT.   This deep specialisation is a thing across the game where a clearly worse player can run into and win a fight just because of the proximity to enemy, weapon or platform that he's using. So i don't see the point of complaining about tomcats other than entitlement to your prefered type of play when majority of server doesn't give a fuck one way or another. Even those that suposedly should be better and setting the trend are often enough themselves part of gutter behavior with the rest of us."

PS2Cobalt,3csqqh,FuzzBuket,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:29:25 2015 UTC,Afaik devs can do that. My assumptions only come from different videos/twitch recordings. Admins can change their faction with commands. But they can also spawn each vehicle.  So my guess is that it was spawned by a admin command with the player being vanu. I'm not saying it was a dev but seems most likely. Seeing what some of those russian hackers did in the last weeks it's not totally out of the question for me that someone figured out a way to do even that.
PS2Cobalt,3csqqh,Noname_FTW,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:08:58 2015 UTC,No nosegun so it's pretty likely that this was spawned with dev commands at least.

PS2Cobalt,3cqizm,MyCreagle,3,Fri Jul 10 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"Good job, now you need at least 576 more schytes assuming that you can kill the pilot too :)  Jokes aside, just practice and remember that having 4 engineers doesn't means that you are immortal, on the other side (based on my experience) if you train on a 2 man valkyrie when you suddenly have more repair passengers you'll feel immortal.  Let the best pilot to be the only pilot and let him train in the art of not being killed, piloting a valkyrie requires dedication while to shoot down most of enemies will require only a semi-decent gunner.  If you have six players the best setup is 2 valkyries, one with wyvern (anti esf and support) and one with hellion (anti tank and anti liberator), everyone is an engineer and the passenger needs an archer. A double valkyrie squad is better than a fully crewed valkyrie."

PS2Cobalt,3clyz8,RachitynowyJoe,6,Thu Jul 9 10:57:32 2015 UTC,"My definition of aim is to lead your shots correctly to get constant hits and that you know how to align your shots to your movement, just like you do with infantry guns too.  Lock-ons are point and click for me, cause the big circle and the change of color from red to green, takes the stuff, I mentioned above already away. So basically you don´t need to know how to aim. You just need to see the color turning into green and then click."

PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,killALLilluminati,7,Thu Jul 9 02:03:01 2015 UTC,Do some PTS against pilots of your skill level and try to fly on rather empty continents when you feel like improving because only flying solo really makes you a better pilot. If you wanna fly at primetime you should get a buddy though but dont fly with actual good pilots because everything you will do is follow them around and look at them killing stuff.

PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,killALLilluminati,-9,Thu Jul 9 10:05:03 2015 UTC,"Stop complaining.   If the guy feels he's not learning anything the way that that game is treating him now then there is absolutely nothing wrong with tomcats or flying in group even if in general he isn't supportive of conduct.  Group play provides you safety net of friendly aircraft that can and will respond to your needs, extra eyes and ability to dictate rules of engagement. Playing with a group  instead of dying in every enconter will result in time spend with each airframe you pull increase 2-3 fold.  Flying experiance is biggest factor to overal flying capability increase and i'd rather do it from a position of enjoyment than one of frustration. Squad play provides this very well. You might not learn as fast as solo flying but you'll still learn never the less.  You'll learn to spot targets, to keep your eyes open, to track and respond to calls, to aim, to chase on offense and evade on defense, to deal with specific aircraft builds in specific ways. Tomcats don't take the aim away they just simplify it. squad play means that you respond with your aircraft according to the needs of the squad. If the situation isn't heavy then people can let you duel a bit before stepping in or you might rely on nosegun more untill someone really needs you to put a hurt on someone else."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,xPaffDaddyx,9,Thu Jul 9 12:48:07 2015 UTC,thats not complaining dude.. thats just a opinion... and from what i understand he wants to get better at aiming dodging etc... and not only killing esf with gank/lock on squad
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,RetOld,-6,Wed Jul 8 18:57:18 2015 UTC,I would agree that you don't learn as fast and as much.   But you still learn majority of what you need to from flying in squad or using tomcats. This is my opinion and fact that i've been flying with tomcats 85% of my time is a proof of testament to it.  Sure i'm not anywhere near good but i have improved considerably and this is with me not really even trying to. I'm not one of those people who strive to improve in video games but one that claws victory out of the grasp of my foes when and where oportunity to do so presents itself.
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,Cornelisatorus,8,Wed Jul 8 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Excuse me for the probably long post:  I had been lurking on reddit for quite some time before i made an account. I read a lot of your posts back then and thought to myself, that you cant possibly be serious, it was very obvious that you are just trolling.  Maybe the stance you have in the post i am replying to right now is really your genuine opinion on the matter. I will try to argue with you though that your philosophy of playing the game makes the game worse, at least partially.  What i mean by that is, it is ok if you think that your gamestyle is actually a valid strategy and you may put your posts in an eloquent way, but you could also cut all the BS and be honest to yourself, because what you are doing is detrimental to the health of the airgame.  I am pretty sure i would not be as good as a pilot as i am now, if it hadnt been a nice coincidence that, back when i chose to create my first char in ps2, i chose Cobalt.  The server culture the best pilots generated and cultivated throughout the life of the cobaltian server deserves nothing but praise. It made the game more fun for all the people who want to pursue the road of improvement, those who want to get challenged and grow by it.  Now lastly, i am pretty sure Cobalt would not be the strong server other competitors fear, the server you know has the best air around, the champion of the last SS session, if the best pilots back then until today had the same mindset as you.  So if not for yourself, maybe for the sake of Cobalt, you may want to rethink your ideas of how this game is to be played. The less we have people who just want to play EZ-mode and actually engage in challenging aspects of the game, the better we, the players of Cobalt and Cobalt itself will become. A respectable and in my opinion desirable outcome indeed."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,RetOld,3,Wed Jul 8 19:29:29 2015 UTC,Well said

PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,Cornelisatorus,2,Wed Jul 8 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"It is a valid strategy. I don't know how long you've been playing on cobalt but i was one of the first if not the first vocal proponent of pulling ESF's in mass, using tomcats and now advocating for more complex way of doing things.   This was back in the day when NC had no air at all. There were FOOL's and few VS airfits of small size and then there was MOSY pouching pilots left and right from both factions. The rotary was extremely strong and pulling lolpods seemed like a natural thing for them. They were killing airgame by having a good 15 dedicated pilots flying around continent who through their little airknight club rarely actually engaged eachother. Since you know killing eachother on live in a non sanctioned 1v1 effected their fragile ego's and made enemies out of people who hanged around together.  It was far more beneficial to crush noobs who dare to enter the skies, send messages to them that they're shit and should stop and continue to lolpod ground without mercy. This of course was effecting my ground objectives and pulling 6-7 burster maxes just to deal with couple of ESF's seemed inadequate of a lesson against them. I started caring and joined an airgame as completely incompetent pilot after hearing that few of my outfit guys who liked to fly and did it as solo pilots stopped flying altogether after getting ganked by elite pilots few times to many. I knew that the people i'd be bringing into the air would be at a far greater disadvantage and thus i picked my battles with sole intent of crushing everything that the airknights stood for. Our goal was always to put them on timers, resource starve them and make them rage quit. I would be the one to raise 30ESF's against 3 MOSY ones, i'd be the one who'd tell people to use tomcats without shame and i'd be the one to teach people to ram a better pilot if you feel you can't win fair. Jump them, get them over skyguards, tomcat them, ram them. Claw your victory from death itself if you have to regardless how weak you feel you are. Use anything at your disposal to achieve it.   The road you and the pilots chose is one for few not many. Majority of people come to have fun and not to jump through hoops and frustration to achieve it. They want to play together with other people and they want to do things the way they see fit without getting shat on. I'm their voice basically. If i wanted to have stupifying challanges then i'd play a competative game or just deal with my real life instead.  Talking about challanging and being competative in a massive casual shitter game is stupid. If pilots want to improve and have fair conduct there is always PTS. All pilots can simply fuck off there and host daily events every day all day. They don't because that would actually require them to put their reputation on the line and face people who can actually shrek them in 1v1 on equal footing. Pilots enjoy the status, the ease with which they win battles and lack of challange from majority of server population who pulls aircraft. This is why they hate individuals in VIPR because they know that those are likewise skilled pilots but who actually are a potential threat in both 1v1 and especially in 2v1 or higher numbered engagements. As oposite of the the 3v1's that they gloat about when it's against ""shitters"".  I advocate for squad play. I without any trolling consider the changes to tomcats to their current state and the addition of coyotes a clear improvement of the airmeta. I would say tomcats could use around 10% damage reduction and ammunition capacity drop to 6 missiles to be in perfect spot without any current changes. I think the current bug/feature in stealth airframe of making coyotes absolete is either really smart or a brilliant fuckup. The airmeta right now is as diverse as player backgrounds. There is no more ""one way to fly"" and it's something i've always wanted since it would be representing the game in a way that ground combat does really well."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,0verkillgaming,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"Thats actually really thought out, and i can only imagine, it must have been painful.  Fortunately i guess, i was not playing at that time, i started playing later. And i can see where you are coming from as well, truces in the airgame sadly are a very real thing, I think most who do that do not understand that, when the good pilots dont engage each other, they will be the only ones in the air the whole time. For newbies to even stand a chance, the best pilots have to constantly engage each other and not together against the newbies, that is very harmful for people who want to improve.  I thank you for your thorough explanation and I can understand really well now where you are coming from thanks to it. But the airgame nowadays is a bit different than back then.  If the problem was pro-pilots working together ganking noobs back then, I think it is now people using lockons, as I think new pilots will be more inclined to use them when they see they are losing to said lockons. That would not improve anyone, certainly not the airgame of Cobalt as a united server."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,Cornelisatorus,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Dont take me the wrong way, I'm not against airgame but i am against constant complains of pilot about every single thing that kills them. From flak, to G2A to airsquads to force multipliers used by them they've always tried to get an advantageous position and maintain status quo. While i've always stood in line with SOE because their balancing act might have been misjudged a lot of cases especially during early introduction and delayed nerfs to things that clearly should have been nerfed. But overal they had a clear picture what they wanted the game to be played like.  As i see it nosegun play is still central aspect of flying and everyone should at least get some experiance with it. Which is what majority of people do. Nobody hates a noob with tomcats, people hate a relatively decent maneuver pilot with them who can lead and maneuver without breaking lock and actually put a nosegun hurt on his enemies in CQC if they get to close.   Like i've said i'd wish further advantages being brought to stealth and maybe a slight nerf on the fire suppression on ESF's. So that people would go for it. I'd also remove ability to liht assault out of aircraft without ejection seat below 10m from ground or remove ejection seat option and replace it with something cooler.   If i'm flying solo i'll often will use nosegun only for training purposes. but if i'm flying even with one person together his airframe's safety is in my hands. I need to be able to support him as best to my abilities and neutralize the threat in shortest amount of time possible so yeah i'll rely on something that's bound to grab enemies attention fastest and get him to peel of my wingman.  I enjoy the most flying in the group and while i'm generally flying tomcats it's my secondary role. Primarily i've got the radar coverage job assigned. I'll lock into target and track him but majority of my effort is overwatching who's entering or leaving AO, the direction of enemies pinging on radar, distance and range, who's got enemy on his tail and where they are. Basically i'm Command and Control craft with killing being least of my concerns. It's my playing style and it's fairly clear if you'll check some of my flying videos of the youtubes."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,0verkillgaming,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I agree with you. It would probably help him at first, flying with a ganking outfit like KMWN, VIPR or JEST probably would help a  fair amount early on."

PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,0verkillgaming,-3,Wed Jul 8 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py0X5mXtUFg I haven't seen you ganking with them (it's a whole different story with VIPR) but Crowley, hex5idiot and many more are incapable of anything but ganking from what I've seen."
PS2Cobalt,3ckrqb,killALLilluminati,11,Wed Jul 8 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Lets be clear here.  I will take a quick statement to the video and move on to what i want to get off my chest, to whomever it may concern.  There is a whole thread dedicated to that video, most of the reasoning as to why that was not a gank is listed there, as my teammates did not engage (most of the time) when there were more of us. The mossies which did were randoms. Even if it was a gank, who cares as long as I am not doing it for the majority of time. And I know I dont.  Now to what I really wanted to say:  I find it very hard to grasp why some BLNG members (some, not all) act the way they do. They like to call others gankers (see your post above) or belittle them (the post im replying to atm).  I know for a fact that hex5 is a very capable pilot, you insulting him tells more about your character than about his skill. Crowley, i frankly do not know how he performs in a 1v1 but i think he can handle himself quite well too.  The ganking. I dont even know where I should begin.  Everyone ganks every now and then, but the way some people from your outfit, and you apparently included, act about it is borderline hypocritical.  I have enough footage where BLNG is doing massive ganking, even cross-faction ones where I am getting ganked by 2+ reavers, 1 mossie and libs. Every informed pilot knows BLNG ganks, heck, even BLNG himself does, but this neverending pissing contest about public-image bullshit seemingly distorts what is really happening from your POV.  The reason i dont upload the footage is because it is damn pointless, as everyone already knows BLNG members gank also, and not too little. Furthermore, i have deep respect for some of your members, and i dont want to paint the whole BLNG outfit in a bad light because certain members decided to be douchebags. Sadly, though, i see that you like to call the entire KMWN outfit a ganking one, thus i cannot see the same common courtesy from your side.   Whenever I see an unfair fight, i try to not engage in it, granted i am in a coordinated squad.  If i am alone, i will go for the kills when i see a random ESF, even if he is getting attacked by others, especially when he is in close proximity to my factions territory (Only exception is when its a hard gank). If you or anyone else got a problem with that, keep that to yourself. I know that i am trying to give people a fair fight as much as i can, even if it doesnt work out all the time, because live gameplay just is like that. If that effort is not enough for some people, so be it.  Ultimately i wanna say, if you got a problem with how certain individuals play, contact them, talk to them. I know you can, i talked to you and played against you, and from the looks of it you can be quite a decent guy and a good pilot. Do not trashtalk the entire outfit, that only leads to unnecessary complications.  The badmouthing doesnt do me, nor my outfit, nor your outfit and especially nor you any favor. Thats all i wanted to say."

PS2Cobalt,3cjpuy,SGTMile,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:52:19 2015 UTC,I mean we could do this as a Pickup event that the pilots show up and  add them to a bracket

PS2Cobalt,3cjpuy,h4ppyj3d1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:42:07 2015 UTC,it will be very hard to balance a pickup event like that unless the person sorting the pilots into teams knows how good every pilot is.  I'd much rather see a 6v6 air smash for outfits and premade teams.
PS2Cobalt,3cjpuy,Rictavius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:34 2015 UTC,I was thinking of like a 1v1 Tournament that would show who is the best of servers/factions/all
PS2Cobalt,3cjpuy,h4ppyj3d1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess that would work but I don't think it would be very fun to watch / commentate. A 6v6/12v12 would put more focus on teamwork then just who has the better aim. I would rather be able to say Im part of the best air outfit/team then just being the best pilot. I also think it would increase interest in forming pure air outfits to focus on this and in turn would make organizing the air for the server smash a hell a lot easier.
PS2Cobalt,3cjpuy,Rictavius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would work and could be done pretty easily, We had a form of AirSmash floating around back when I became and admin, not sure what happened to it though"

So that worked and I just bought a new card and got a BSOD again.  Uninstalled all drivers and reinstalled only the important drivers fixed the problem. And after downloading raptr again, and going into PS2 I got a BSOD after half an hour, so yeah since that day I don´t really use it anymore, cause it is annoying as fuck.   TL,DR: I could record, but my game will randomly crash and I will get a BSOD. It´s randomly crashing, sometimes after 5 minutes and sometimes after 3 days. Tried OBS, but I get fps drops while using it, same with fraps."
PS2Cobalt,3cggze,dariobltn,2,Wed Jul 8 08:46:53 2015 UTC,That sounds to me like your cpu needs more food. Either you have to underclock your cpu and keep your vcore or keep your cpu at its clock speed but increasing the vcore.

About Brutal skill in Lib I think no one will disagree the fact that he is one of the best at least. So killing him is a kind of achievement. No need to take this as an offence imo.
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,NerfDragonhawks,-2,Tue Jul 7 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"Why you take each kill as bashing    I wasn´t refering to the video, but to some comments below it."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,HerrLuky,6,Tue Jul 7 15:41:13 2015 UTC,For me Brutal behavior ingame or in reddit can explain this kind of comment. I don't mean he diserves it.
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,xPaffDaddyx,-3,Tue Jul 7 15:54:41 2015 UTC,You mean when you tried to let me die to YESSME yesterday and then sent me a pm and I just told you not to bother? Didn't even comment that you went VS just to gank us yesterday :o
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,HerrLuky,4,Tue Jul 7 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Vous ne vous reposez jamais vous ? No I don't mean this, cause actually I tried to help you, but doing this to late and then you become agressive with me. And i'm pretty sure that if i could have kill Yessme before you die you would send me ""DOn't steal my kill"". This kind of stuff explain your bashing."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,LeKunibert,-6,Tue Jul 7 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"His vid was deleted from the reddit, if our mods are correct they should remove this thread too but yeah cobalt reddit is anti BLNG even the mods you can't deny that."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,Pleto1,7,Tue Jul 7 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"I dont deny this, even if i'm not anti bling. But you really think this anti BLNG appear by magic suddenly ? There is a reason for that,and you can blame yourself for being hated ( I mean by guy who have serious reason to hate you). To finish in a positive way, I think lot guy like you but they don't show their Bling love at the same level of haters. Make an effort on your comment, dont take each criticize or content with your name as an insult and things will probably get better, at least I wish for you cause your situation on reddit isn't enjoyable"
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,OnlyPuzzle,5,Wed Jul 8 00:01:22 2015 UTC,"Look man nobody has any problem with some individuals in BLNG and all the problems with other individuals in same outfit.   It's because some know to keep their mouths shut when the drama rises up, others know that they can't talk shit without coming out looking like absolutely humongous hypocrites.  Who does it leave though. It leaves the hypocretimus sapiens of BLNG to pick up the hate tab with their pure vile shit like you've been derailing my thread with.   Every comment you receive you perceive as an insult, every statement you make is hypocritical shit. You talk of ganking, of tomcats, of coyotes but yet there is neither enforced rule against any of those thing thing nor is it really shunned when you decide to come down from your tall decaying putrid of a high horse. It's all situational with you guys isn't it and that's why you're hated basically. Not because you do or not do things but because you claim you don't but do them anyways. People notice and they call you out on it here daily. Not all of you. Just you in particular and couple of more fine inidividuals.   I tried staying out of this but you left me no choice by wanting to remove my beloved thread.   Let me elaborate you on something. If you're refering to Kuni's video being deleted then get it in your skull that it got removed not because of what was in it. But because it was using discostoff's footage without his consent. It was basically theft of content and it's not something i've personally got any problem with but mods obviously did.  On mods. They're not against BLNG, they're against people being cunts. I fill up that role nicely myself but i'd suggest some of you do self reflection on your characters before loudmouthing others.  See you on stream and in game. Join Jesters at Jestersnc.com"
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,revolver1,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"Actually it got removed because someone complained about the comments below it not because i used footage of his stream. I'm ok with that as long as they do that on every thread (even though it would be fucking bullshit and bore me to death), or if my video has been removed because i took stuff from Disco's stream. But im quite sure this thread would also get removed if someone actually wants it to be taken down, which would have to be one of the BLNG guys because who else cares about it really."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,OnlyPuzzle,7,Tue Jul 7 18:25:49 2015 UTC,To anyone reading. This post i'm replying to is the prime example of a emotionally charged bullshit post and type of behavior that makes BLNG members drag their outfit rep through the dirt. All self inflicted of course.  So someone wrote that he shreks Brutal's lib all the time which is probably 100% true. Taking out libs isn't rocket science as long as you play your cards right and bring couple of friends.  Punisher arrives for a dedicated wingman role with tales of great skill in the kingdom of BLNG and how their enemies are peasantry of lowest class and probably have AIDS or something.   Proceeds with character assassination of the highest order by making an outlandish beyond believe claim of his BLNG mandingo being 100 times better than the VIPR mandingo. While in reality the skill gap between upper midrange/good pilots and ace pilots is around 20% or below.  But the main point being that nobody fucking asked him to contribute in defense of another player. Generally if someone talks shit about my outfit i'll defend the outfit if we aren't in the wrong nor contributing to hypocritikhall conduct. If someone talks shit about me i'll defend myself and if someone talks shit about individual players within my outfit well isn't it their own problem then?.  Get on my level at jestersnc.com my logic is easily 100 times better in both aspects .

The fact wich encourage me to participate to this party was the moment when I saw Punisher in a lib (i guess sololib) getting out the warpgate, being engaged by 3-4 scyte and your 4-5 mossie did'nt move to help him.  So to preserve your precious kd or killboard or i don't know what you let your outfitmates die ? I'm sure if you go on us you could kill lot of us (maybe 5/7) and be proud of this behavior. But you don't.  Either you take Planetside as a game, and other player don't have to adapt to your mood or lifeplay and it's useless to complain or you take Planetside more seriously than a simple game and in case playing like true brother in arms.

PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,Punisher_Ps2,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"To be perfectely honest. I don´t give a shit if you had 10 scythes or 5 scythes and blablabla. I commented, because some people found it funny, to make fun of an outfitmate, for not really any specific reason.  If you think I wanted to start a retarded discussion about ""ganking"" again, then I just say no. But think what you want, I am really sick of this, cause we actually tried not to bash people here anymore, except of xtc, cause he isn´t playing anymore or for whatever reason.   We tried to get a better mood into the airplatoon in serversmashes that way, so we don´t have squads that hate each other flying together and actually get an airforce that likes to fly together. But no, some really special guys have to bash others again.   We weren´t even saying anything, but yeah that´s how it goes."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,D3athBringerTR,4,Tue Jul 7 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"OK well for the gank, your point to don't care of this unending topic.    cause we actually tried not to bash people here anymore, except of >xtc, cause he isn´t playing anymore or for whatever reason.   You especially Punisher is a kind of model for this and i respect you for this and others reason. But I think you BLING can't be love by anyone and you should better ignore this kind of comment. And the comment of Cornelisatorus about Brutal is not bashing.  WHen you see this kind of Vid, just ignore. If you write rude comment (cf Puzzle) you will let drama come, so choose your words better. Try to not react quickely with angry. Anger leads to Hate, Hate leads to suffering ...  You won't change the community, your fight is lost before begin.   And in my personnal case, you can see that i never bashing you without reason."
PS2Cobalt,3cbzot,xPaffDaddyx,2,Tue Jul 7 17:55:31 2015 UTC,Yes noted how you're being the better man there punisher by accusing VIPR of ganking when you guys are mirror fucking image of them.   You got about equal amount of skill and equal amount of honor but at least they're not being shit about it. They know they gank and they're fine with it. You know you gank and you're accusing others of doing the same? I know what you've had for breakfast at least.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYpnINrZM_M <- Punisher's breakfast.

However, if you dont have many problems with dying too quickly, you might cert into hover 3 first (not much suggested, even tho it will improve your movement).

PS2Cobalt,3c3zo9,ceih,16,Sat Jul 4 15:34:28 2015 UTC,Would she ? I'm serious. Does whoever suggested this really know her that much ?  It feels weird to me. Most likely noone from Cobalt knew her at all (Correct me if I'm wrong). So it kinda feels like profiting from her death.  But other than that of course it's for a good cause so I'm all for it. The circumstances are just ....  Please let noone prevent this to help. I just wanted to speak of my mind and see what others have to say.
PS2Cobalt,3c3zo9,Noname_FTW,2,Sat Jul 4 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware this was definitely an outfit mate of hers and was responsible for some of the earlier threads. I do trust that this would be supportive of those things she would be interested in. Even if she didn't directly mention the charity it might represent some of the things she felt strongly about. If for whatever reason something happened within our own outfit there are several people that I am sure I could find similar charities for.  Either way, donate or do not donate. But on the miller thread I believe it was ethnicbadgers who asked for it to be posted on our sub when they had decided a charity, and I was also interested to know which one it was. I don't think this is directly profiteering from the situation"
PS2Cobalt,3c3zo9,Xaniy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:46:51 2015 UTC,I don't think this is directly profiteering from the situation    That might be. But isn't it weird how people always seem to care only after someone died ? And just for a while.  It's the a similar sentiment with catastrophes or climate change.   Now it's suicide. Someone might have been able to do something before it happens but we have to see the endresult to all of the sudden start screaming and caring. Because we got emotionally touched for a moment and then couldn't help us to praise the deceased name and donate to a charity. Because then we can lie to ourself we really made a big change. Even though we don't even have to blame ourself for anything.  For me thats hypocritical (And I'm NOT saying the charity thing is hypocrtical if it came from someone who cared about her before she died!). And I am not excluding myself from it. I'm just beeing honest. But thats just my 2 cents.
PS2Cobalt,3c3zo9,Noname_FTW,3,Sat Jul 4 21:49:54 2015 UTC,"True as that maybe, but inherently we are selfish by nature. Sometimes these events remind us of our ability to be selfless for once.  Wether motivated by guilt, fear, or sorrow, a good deed done is still a good deed. I am not trying to pretend that what you said isn't true. On the contrary, it is exactly that.  Through this event that has happened within the community we have all in some way been connected to it. Through its awareness an opportunity has been presented to do some good in a cause that either Sophie felt strongly about, or perhaps a charity that could have or did provide her support. Either way, at this time there are some people who are sad that they did not have a chance to have met or help prevent a young girl from taking an irreversible cause of action. Yet through some independent donations we might help others in a similar situatuation.  I agree with you, why this charity ... why now? But I ask you, if not this charity, then which, and when?  I don't give money to large national charities except the British legion. But I do give time, food and drink to the homeless persons in my city. Why? Guilt at first I guess, now? It is more than that. I feel it is my moral obligation. Why them and not others in the world? No reason. I am not a rich man, I can not help them all. But I can help some. And these are the people I see every day.  This event is very visible and from the other events we have all seen how a lot of the people we play with daily have their own struggles and any one of us could find ourselves in this situation in the future.  Giving money won't help everyone. But it will help some.  I appreciate and respect your decision not to donate to this charity. But it might be a good opportunity to take some time to donate to a charity that is perhaps closer to your own heart. I just found it a little rash and thoughtless (perhaps I did not understand the tone in which it was written) the manner in which you responded to the guy, who at the request of other cobaltians (and a fellow outfit mate of yours) to post on our Reddit with this information.  I actually respect him/her for not responding to this post and would just like to let him know that I and at least 2 others thank him/her for posting this here as we asked"
PS2Cobalt,3c3zo9,Xaniy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:40:33 2015 UTC,In all posts of this thread I'm expressing my opinion in the most respectfull way. As I said my initial question was completly serious.  And I don't want to discourage anyone from donating. I just expressed my opinion on the matter. My frustration. Because suicide is preventable.  And since the post got 14 points at this moment it seems I'm not alone with it.

Not that I can proffess to know any reasons for why Sophia felt there were no other options, but it makes me sad to feel that this was the choice she made and that noone was able to show her otherwise.  A lot of people who really throw themselves into games do so as an escape mechanism for depression. I've battled with depression for the last 12 years and on occasions it can be one of the most all consuming and crippling experiences. If anyone reading this feels it a little overwhelming please always feel free to message me at any time if you just want to talk.  Most importantly, go to see your doctor. The hardest thing I've really dealt with is facing up to this problem. I did not want to be weak, I did not want to chemically regulate my moods, I thought I was too 'smart' for depression, I felt I had no right to be depressed. The truth is we can all struggle, and we all struggle daily in multiple ways, but you do not have to do it alone. In my personal life it is only my mother and my GF who know about this, but I tell all of you today because I dont ever want anyone to feel so alone that they can never find a way out.  RIP Sophia, people will miss you and you will be remembered. Condolonces to all her friends and family who must be struggling at this time. I wish you all the strength to help go through this."

You relate more to people that don't fear standing against you in opinion or even those that you generally do not like because of what they say as long as they don't go too far outside of the norm in the societal norms with their opinions.

Xaniy's written enough, and well enough, for me to simply add that to anyone in the situation that there is always help available and lots of others (more than many i think would suspect) out there."
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,BlckJck103,6,Fri Jul 3 11:02:30 2015 UTC,i can relate...  not entirely sure wether or not i have depression myself but i know quite a few who do (and luckily went to see doctors with that).  one particular case was rather grim though i'd guess. i remember talking to her a lot back then and i feel like it kinda helped her. haven't talked to her in a while but seeing her online playing every day makes me happy.
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,TGangsti,7,Fri Jul 3 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"I've suffered from several bouts of depression over the last 15-20 years. I also have a number of friends who've also suffered - and are suffering - from it.  I agree, depression is one of the toughest things to face because you're having to face yourself and the all denial that goes with it. You tell yourself ""I'm not sick, I'm fine"". ""I'm not losing control of my emotions, I'm fine"". ""I'm not closing down, I'm fine"". But you're not fine.  There's also guilt as well, which also stops you from wanting to talk to anyone about it. Guilt because, as you said, ""I felt I had no right to be depressed"". It's a very hard thing to try to describe to someone who's not gone through it.  But I was lucky enough to have people around me who'd been through it themselves, who spotted the things I was trying to ignore. It's something for which I'm very, very grateful for.  I can't agree more with Xaniy and others, talk to people. Don't keep that inside and don't think you're giving up and looking weak by talking about it.  RIP Sophia, I hope you find something better on the other side."
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,Selerox,-3,Fri Jul 3 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with reaching out and discussing your issues with others. There is certainly nothing that should make you feel guilt or think that you have no right to have emotional breakdown, medical or situation induced depression.  But and it's a big butt.. Nothing wrong to being stoic and self reliant about it either. Get help if you feel that you need it.  But likewise if you're one of the people that deal with problems self reliantly better then nothing wrong with keeping it to yourself. It's all down to individuals and people you speak to. It's a diffucult problem to deal with and it for the most part relies on how individuals perceave the world and their strenght of character or flaws of character.  So to some getting the word out or talking about such thing might be just the right thing. For others going out and trying to be social while hiding it might feel and be the right solution. For someone lonewolfing and burrying himself in hobbies might keep him out of the noose.  Stating that talking about things will help is in itself a misdemeanour of a sort since to some people talking things through might do absolutely nothing or even the oposite. On the flipside if anything else isn't working then you might as well open up to people in cases where you wouldn't have before."

PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,Noname_FTW,4,Fri Jul 3 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"I have my own experience being sucidial. As a person with a low variant of Asberger Syndrom I was and I will always be different. It took me most of my life to realize and accept this. Not knowing why I'm different made my life as a kid and teenager a hell.  And I thought about killing myself for many years. Now I'm glad I never attempted it.   Suicide is selfish.  You might think that noone cares. But your death will always affect someone. It is so selfish because the pain you feel is given to anyone who cares. Suicide does not end the chances of life getting worse, suicide eliminates the possibility of it ever getting better.  For me things got better. My life changed after I got out of school. I seeked help. It took many years. People say I'm alone now but I am speaking to dozens of people around the world on a daily bases In a language that wasn't taught to me by my parents. And I'm happy.  I don't want pitty. I'm only saying this so that someone might rethink before trying to attempt suicide. A little sidenote: Most attempts fail. Some of them make your life more miserable because you hurt yourself."

PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,RetOld,5,Fri Jul 3 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"Why should it. It's not your fight, it's theirs.  If they deemed themselves worthy of taking an early trip over the sanzu river it's their choice and while i'd advocate to seek help, cling to life and overcome things as much as possible. I will not blame people for going out the way she did if they decided to go through with it at the end.  Sometimes either situation or your state is unbarable and that particular door out is as good as any. The only dilema at the end of the day is if your choice to leave the world of the living is thought through sound enough to justify the sorrow and consiquences your actions will have on those who remain topside."

Everyone has it's opinion, I just find this is subject that doesn't need them."
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,RetOld,3,Fri Jul 3 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's all you can do really in any given situation. It's that individual's fight and you can only provide as much support as they are willing to let you give them.  Provide help when people ask for it but if they don't it's hardly your fault for not acting upon something you did not see or notice.   I'm one of those introverted fucks when it comes to own issues. You'll almost never hear me speak anything bad about myself, my life or anything happening IRL in bad light simply because i do not find it usefull and enjoy a level of privacy and understanding that my issues are just that, MY OWN. I do not value people interfering with my issues untill i reach the point that they are either beyond my capacity to cover by myself or involve to many people from the start to keep others out of it. This is my point to you and i cover it further through different posts i've made in this thread regarding the suicide issue as a whole.  Conversation on any subject isn't unhealthy really. There is no subject that can't or shouldn't be debated among people for it opens avenues for further understanding of subject, new views on subject or further solidifying pre astablished points and ideas you held on said subject. So even here we disagree somewhat.  I do not take offense either at your demands for me to remove my opinion because it's quite a macabre topic we're discussing relating to a tragic incident within the community we share."

I had/have a difficult and problematic family aswell and im pretty sure i suffer under depression,  but im glad it was just a thought and i didnt killed myself."
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,RetOld,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"Everyone at least once faces a situation in their life where it becomes a valid exit strategy from their at the moment perspective.  The need in every individual is to adress it properly. Reasons for thinking it, benefits and negative aspects going through with it. Material shit, debts and all that jazz is never something that should even function in your mind when thinking about it. It should be always a zero sum game between your actions being a great way out of your emotional situation and your actions effecting others in horrible way.  It needs to be taken as seriously as any biggest decision in your life and methods of executing it need to be as drastic while removing as much human factor that others might be part of as possible. I fucking hate people who end their lives by doing it in grand way or effecting complete strangers. They get absolutele zero pity from me and their backstory and woes are completely of no concern because they took a path that fucks over another human being who is living and will have to live with it for the rest of their lives. Stories when people attempt suicide and then weazel out at the last moment are sort of an issue with me too. It devalues your decision making at the moment and makes it so much easier to attemp fallowup's for pity and attention. Without removing actual danger of dying in the least.  If you need help seek it before going through.  So in summery avoid this shit at all cost but if you're doing it do it right with a forethought of effecting as few people as possible in the process. You going out shouldn't leave family, friends and strangers emotionaly scarred for life in the process beyond the minimum that your loss will bring.  Not talking about you in particular but in general terms."
PS2Cobalt,3bywm8,TheFatherlessChild,2,Fri Jul 3 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"best solution to suicide is to not let people get depressed. Keep people motivated, give them a goal. My friend told me he felt a bit down n all cos he'd lost drive and/or something to go for. I've spent the past 3 months working out with the guy to make us the most buff ass motherfuckers we can be. Don't tell depressed people how terribly others will be affected by their death, tell them all the cool stuff you can do. Walk into school first day of the year in a bathrobe. Climb the school roof and set up a tent there (did that) be as crazy as you can be. Do crazy shit. Then find your drive and start beating the fuck out of lifes obstacles again."

PS2Cobalt,3bvcst,Xaniy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"Thats probably more of an effect rather than a cause.  There are enough responses in this thread to give you the overall feeling that there just isnt really any interest in alerts on the NC side, especially from what might be considered its capable leaders.  Thats not to say these leaders do not cooperate with other outfits, this is far from the case, but the unmoderated Command Channel more often than not remains muted fro myself and a large portion of others unless we feel like playing an alert.  Two further problems arise: squad becaon usage that requires rotation of SL in small squads negates the use of a CC unless you have a PL; and that the alert wins/playstyle means so little that win or lose, it is only the fight in your own squads that matter.  There was a backlash (that I agreed with) against trying to make liveplay more organised and focus from the SSmash guys. But it works two ways, those guys arent really interested in trying to do anything organised unless it is done properly. Sadly this requires alot effort on all parts.  Seeing as we cant find any middle ground between casual and serious players something will need to be done to entice the m back to liveplay alerts, because as it stands I would much rather be on Jaeger doing scrims than playing live alerts.  A further problem is that command chat has no prerequisite other than spending certs. If you are regularly on command channel (think Kelpi etc) as someone who is running outfit based squads for more than 4-5 hours a day, it doesnt take long before you end up silencing it. I'm all for helping newer players who make poor tactical decisions, but there is a; a limit to how much you can do and b; a limit to how much they are willing to listen. Sadly I dont think this will ever change, no matter how much we all try, but then thats just the pessimist in me."
PS2Cobalt,3bvcst,denhaal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Hi,  don´t worry about this. That happens every year again ( as JohnMcDude wrote). But there are some simple facts leading to a non-coordinating zerg: Base-defending/Base-capturing are not as worthfull as kills/revives/ammo-spending. I mean that you make more xp/min killing enemies without any tactical sense than to capture a base. It makes me really angry because with some simple changes this game could have a really interessting tactical gameplay.

PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,RachitynowyJoe,14,Thu Jul 2 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"If we can continue in ServerSmash the way we have in the past, I don't see any need for this.  I wouldn't want to tell PL13 they can't bring a squad, so that Vipers or another outfit can bring 2. PL13 has always worked hard for SS. They performed well. And they took it seriously.  The only times I ever thought an outfit shouldn't participate, was when they clearly didn't take things seriously. You want to sign up br10's to serversmash? You want to sign up 'pilots' with less than 100 esf kills for the air platoon? Those people I tell no, in fact I'll tell them fuck no, if that's how Cobalt wants to do things, we're out. But it's not how Cobalt does things.  I think the way we do things is nice. It works. And I wouldn't want to change it for something like 'EliteSmash'. Even if we participated, we'd probably end up contacting PL13 to ask if they can bring a squad anyway.   Because who would play? Fool can't bring more than a squad, Blng can't even fill a squad, Vipers would really struggle to consequently bring 2 squads, Chi hasn't even sent one squad for quite a while, T0T has never had interest in ServerSmash, Dhmr doesn't have the activity to bring a squad, ... Maybe Rmis could bring 2 strong squads. Maybe, I don't know. But that's probably about it.  So who would really play this 'Elitesmash'? It would be the same outfits that now play Serversmash. I'm not even sure if we would participate, because if it would be organised by PSB, I don't think we'd want to. I already told them we're not interested in PSBL or any of their new events, because of the way they do things. It's a cerclejerk that celebrates incompetence. Look at the current drama. Instead of embracing people like Blckjck, Halo, and their counterparts from other servers, all they do is piss them off and say how it's only thanks to PSB that ServerSmash is what it is now. It's not, people from all servers put in a lot of time and effort to make it a great event. You should respect those people, and be thankful for their contributions. When is the last time you saw Mael or Dotz thank the people from Cobalt or Emerald for their continued efforts at making ServerSmash great? Yeah, that never happened.  The only reason we put up with it for ServerSmash is because we still enjoy playing for Cobalt, and Cobalt seems to enjoy having us on the team."

PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,BlckJck103,5,Fri Jul 3 10:45:05 2015 UTC,"The fact is it's like this: 90% of Cobalt outfits we talk to already want to take the current smash seriously. Cobalt doesn't really have the option, or will tbh, in creating a super stacked team. If they made ""EliteSmash"" I'd be happy to take the same outfits and process we have into that.  For Cobalt, an ""EliteSmash"" would be less inclusive, it could easily be 144v144, and then we'd have to have outfits who do perfectly well left out. Yes the current smash means some can't play, we're limited to 240. But most people are happy with our system and everyone gets a chance to compete for those spots. We can't please everyone, we just try and make sure that we judge every application fairly. It would also mean that regular smash would drop as well. If you took the outfits that wanted to play smash seriously and split them, the elitesmash team would have more outfits than the serversmash team.  I really don't like this idea because the current serversmash is fine, the idea has been created to solve Miller Drama but no-one has thought how the servers with currently no real selection issues would cope (Emerald & Cobalt). Elitesmash for us would just be regular smash, I mean I don't know of any outfit in the last smash who didn't put effort in, work hard and try to bring a good squad.  Also you sell PL13 short by saying that VIPR-2 would be an ""Obvious choice"" over PL13. PL13 have played in a lot of smashes because you show commitment to improving and working hard before the match, you'll willing to take feedback and have always done your best and put the team first. It's not as simple as just taking the ""best"" with no regards for how the team works. No-one in the last smash was in the team because ""We can't stack so let them in"" you all earned the spots you had and if it had been a Super serious try-hard elite mega smash, I'd take the same team all over again."
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,BlckJck103,2,Thu Jul 2 11:39:09 2015 UTC,"I wanted to depict what a potential downside would be, in simplified manner. I know that we would work out good system to validate participants no doubt.  I've portrayed my outfit here in comparison to VIPR out of feeling that we represent outfit that really needs to work on themselves and VIPR as a very competitive and capable outfit. As proud as i am as outfit leader(and i am really proud of my guys as i know they gave 100% that time) identifying our flaws and eliminating them is the only way i can think of now. Taking those 2 examples i also hoped to skip any drama from shitfits vs elitefites.   There is no spite here, i personally think that for serversmash the best team should be composed and my sole purpose is to prepare and get good enough to be part of it. I have my doubts if we have now right to get into the tournament. On last, outfit-wide, meeting i said it to my guys clearly that we have much to work on now if we want to earn our place there. We now have month or so to rebuild and straighten our team to best condition and i will try to work closely with smash team to validate that effort and point into the right direction. I would rather not signup at all than have doubts in our performance. PL13 of the old was quite satisfying but I don't want to cling to it, because there is PL13 of present which have much to learn and, if everything goes right, much to offer.  I believe that serversmash is highly competitive match and can't imagine it other way. Fairness doctrine did sound cool and all... but not very realistic. After all, every server will unintentionally stack teams not even by enforcing it by own rules but by sole strive to get better. On cobalt we have no issue with this because the only outfits who are willing to truly participate sign up and they are pointed in right direction to get there and cobalt council is god damn good tool for it.   If numbers get lower(144vs144) i would just simply ask my guys: ok, there is the elitesmash but signups are very hard. Are you willing to train so hard to compete with those guys, those guys and those guys? I can try make it happen, but it will be bumpy road and it require fair share of commitment. And base on that answer i would either really commit to practices or cheer guys on stream feeling proud that our servers is that good."
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,Bringerofwinter,4,Thu Jul 2 12:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well anyone from old Cobalt knows that PL13 will always bring their best, and that you'll listen to feedback and try to improve. I hope you can get PL13 to the point your happy signing them up. Because your attitude, like Bringer's, is the one we need; people who want to be best."
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,BlckJck103,12,Thu Jul 2 12:56:54 2015 UTC,"Alright here are my 2 cents of why i do the SS and what i expect from it and do or inerprete it whatever way you like.  As many know already im the leader of TEIC an old tag on Cobalt (original Cobalt even) and when i took over i had 1 goal! To be good enough for the SS!  I took over when Cobalt just won the championship and it was something that i was proud and happy about.  This was also why i made up my mind and knew what to strive for a TEIC team in SS would mean that not only we weren't  a dead outfit anymore but also had good players and could make a difference on live.  Now if we would change formats for the SS and lets say have outfits like BKNE and TTRO (although they probably have a few good players as well) in the SS this would mean that it wouldn't be a competitive match anymore but a make everyone happy piece of crap!  Now what would happen if it would turn out to be a piece crap selection process. Well the good outfits will keep striving to become better and stronger that made them strong outfits in the first place. But the shitfits as i like to call them wont have anything to strive for they won't be like ""mmm if we want to be repped in the SS we might have to become better"". And this will effect live gameplay as well.  Because this will give the game even less of an end game ofcourse there are people who still need to get BR100 but this isnt really an end game is it?  So yes you can do a ""normal"" SS where every outfit can get in no matter how good they are just by the order of time they signed up or something. But then we would also need an Elite smash for the ""hardcore"" outfits.  And luckily from what i have seen the selection process on Cobalt is good and they really are involved with the outfits they are considering (wich again i wanna thank Blackjack Halospud and TobyHD for) and give them advice and tell them what they are doing well and what can be improved.  So if anything i'd say make the selection process even more hardcore and get even more selective. And yes i realise that if this happens outfits like VIPR and RMIS would get 2 squads and TEIC probably none but that would motivate me even more to get in there.  So TL;DR Leave the selection as it is or make it even more selective."

We've barely begun to scratch the surface of the potential in training and equipping all our outfits with the best tactics and knowledge, and aiming drills, and all you have to have is alts, go on TS, occasionally PTS, and have an open mind."
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,TazTheTerrible,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:29:11 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you there. Assuming RMIS would get two squads in the next smash (it will allready be difficult to get 24 members together) I definitelly doubt that a 2nd squad (conidering the best players are in the 1st squad) would be stronger than a stacked PL13 or TEIC squad. It is just very unlikely to get 24 of our ~top 30 mebers together at one evening.
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,xdcAlzir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"This.  Also do not undervalue yourselves, anyone willing to put time and effort into training and preparation can (and basically always does) deliver a team worthy of ServerSmash.

PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,Shenel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:35:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't change anything for the real ServerSmash. If you wanna do an elitesmash I would tone it down to 48vs48. You get the finest of the finest in a platoon and Cobalt will still beat the shit out of some servers.  For Cobalt it will be easy to find the best 48 players of the server. No Outfit restriction. Just pure stats and skill (<- reputation). Participation would be through application. The choice would be made by the server rep and maybe 3-4 other respected members of cobalt from all factions. The Platoonleader would be chosen from the council itself and then asked if he/she wants to lead the best of the best of Cobalt.
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,Noname_FTW,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:22:04 2015 UTC,"thats called lanesmash and its already a nobody gives a fuck about event.   if elitesmash is a thing, then it needs to be bigger scale than 1 platoon."

PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,BrillouinZone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:45:57 2015 UTC,Well maybe Cobalt is in the unique state that we already put forwad our best. If you are not in an outfit and nobody knows you it's gonna be hard for you to participate. Maybe in the air platoon but the normal infantery is full. Indirectly someone has to vow for you. Either it is your reputation (Can't remember anyone from cobalt that is not in an outfit) or your Outfit Leader. And the places for the outfits are quite limited.  We might look more for thats than normally but a normal sized Elitesmash wouldn't change much for us. We take Server Smash seriously (most of the time.). And the results are there when we do. (First Contintent lock while Server Smashing and Winner of the first season)
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,Noname_FTW,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"well yes, that's the issue... the overall attitude regarding competition on cobalt is very different than it was on Woodman, and is now on Miller.  For cobalt, many of you have said that an elitesmash is little different from regular serversmash because all aplicants are in it to win it...   It's not Miller losing most games that has turned me off from SS, it's unwillingness to improve after the first loss streak  I mean miller had more drama after a recent win in a SS match than it ever does after a loss"
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,Shenel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:40:55 2015 UTC,For us it's just the difference of veterans participating or not. My preditction is that many old outfits that are not participating in live play will help cobalt to win SS 2015. Thats what happened in the last smash. BlckJck and several other old players came back and started leading. It was a test run. And we owned our opponent.  I heard we lost several smash in between. But that was because these players did not participate. I did neither.

PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,JackHerrr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the fact of the matter is, you don't have 240 elite players you can get to show up on the same day. Any outfit that really wants to participate in smash and organizes dedicated trainings for that purpose is pretty much already on the team.   You could get your elite outfits to pull out all the stops and actually stack your team significantly maybe once or twice a year, when you tell everyone ""this is for the world title so you HAVE to train hard and bring as many people as you can"".   But outside of that, people have lives, and you can't seriously expect outfits to dedicate all of their top members for every match (including the trainings and preparations every time).   ""Elite"" smash really wouldn't be very different from a regular smash after about three matches in."
PS2Cobalt,3bv0km,FishRoll,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"SS was never about skill, but dedication. Many times MACS sends their competitive B team instead of the A team. Because people have more going on in their live then a game.  All aside, I think this is a very interesting idea."

As it stands, Emerald has what, AC and DA? And what about Cobalt? T0T is Aggregation + who? DHMR and FOOL have a peak online of 2-4 players. If we want elite smashes, the outfit leaders should be motivated to actually scout out good players and recruit, which in some cases would require a change of the actual leader. As it stands, the only outfit who are strongly recruiting are now CHI and I don't even know if they fill the ""elite"" part."

And the tracert to the minecraft servers shows no problem with the signal at the level3 nodes. Which is the same for Planetside btw. When doing a tracert to Cobalt, the signal is quick and stable, until it passes level3. Only afterwards, I get timeouts.  Almost feels like level3 is just being blamed for DBG/SOE fuckups."

PS2Cobalt,3bserp,Aloysyus,5,Wed Jul 1 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really care how you do your invites, i see how many members you have, how many were not online for 1-1.5 years and what numbers your outfit usually has when attacking a base.

And if you see us flying for a couple of days that does not mean that we just do that because you might not have been where we did different things.

Because i smell bullshit here and a cheap return for my critique a couple days ago. I am not the first one who told you that TFDN is a zergfit and you should re-think your leadership before talking about how to organize in this game. Suddenly i were a ""cunt"".

PS2Cobalt,3bsihl,Aggregationn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:03:53 2015 UTC,Same setup here. How much RAM do you have and which programm you use?  I'm running OBS in buffer mode (pretty much works like shadowplay) set to 3 minutes and that takes whopping 130MB of my 16GB RAM (at any time). Continious recording goes straight to the second HDD (i'm running OS on SSD and games from the first HDD). Only issue i have here and then is encoding which makes clips seem laggy while the game runs all fluid.
PS2Cobalt,3bsihl,h4ppyj3d1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:16:21 2015 UTC,"I only have 8GB RAM, and I just have shadowplay set to 8mins. I could try setting it lower in mins but eventually ps2 still catches up with the memory leaks eventually."

PS2Cobalt,3bsihl,Aveik,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:10:49 2015 UTC,Thats what I try to use. The problem is that when I have PS2 open I only have around 1GB of RAM available for shadowplay. It would probably be enough but PS2 has memory leaks and gradually needs more RAM the longer you play. This means it has to wait to use RAM thats not available and causes huge stuttering and fps loss.
PS2Cobalt,3bsihl,JustANoobFromMiller,-2,Thu Jul 2 10:37:35 2015 UTC,When i get a new GPU ill of course fill up the places between 1 and 5 in your top 5 plays so sure just do it but wait for me ;-) /s

During some boring MAX crush I was trying to get some kills with RL, when suddenly saw a grenade indicator. When I turned around, I saw a grenade sticked to tank mine, both floating in the air, in the middle of a group of friendlies. Overshield saved me, but not everyone was so lucky. This happened twice back then. I Raptr'd it and only frame by frame search showed a Vanu Engi, running past us all and back. It was this guy:  https://www.planetside2.com/players/#!/5428109895915920225/weapons  The thing I learned on Miller is that with shitty ping You won't shot many people - everyone looks, like they were warping around. But explosives are client-side, on enemy side.  On the other hand, I noticed, that Soxanos was only killing stationary targets - maybe they wern't warping on his screen?  Conclusion: Can't tell if Soxanos is abusing a bug (lag), or using a lag-switch, but untill Devs will somehow solve this situation, simply don't stand still."

We took measurements in this matter, we banished Soxanos from the clan and we will look more closely into that.  Personaly we are sorry for the discomfort Soxanos caused you and we understand how frustrating it is to get killed by a warping/cheating/lagging player. We all know that.  But I want to make some things clear to you, fellow cobaltarians.   LTOD does NOT SUPPORT HACKERS nor we're a hacker-clan. Soxanos got exhorted a lot from us leaders because we couldnt stand this exploit. Now we realised that we should have kicked him out of the clan a lot earlier, so we could have stoped this controversy at its root. And we do not approve of this ""outfit-shameing"", just because one member does something bad/exploites does not mean the whole outfit works the same way.    KLATU:  ""I saw his laggs ingame, and I couldnt belive that they are just ""laggs"". So the corollary was to kick him out of the clan....btw. der Headmaster ist scheiße.""  regards,  Ludwig Steiner"

PS2Cobalt,3bfx5j,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"The logistical problem happened when our Air vanished and the FC had to move platoons after platoons to deal with the fire.  From my personal standpoint I believe, instead of going for a fair fight in the beginning over Pale we should have gone balls deep and then move on to different lanes. But hey I just a noob.   It was really hard for us, the average joes but we hope next time the Connery wise men will get their act together.  Thank you."
PS2Cobalt,3bfx5j,jarrettwold,2,Sun Jun 28 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"Heya.  So, all told I ended up ordering about 150+ people (that's including the entire air ball) into that base.  Echo Valley and Eisa Southern were all equally valid threats for Waterson's.  Waterson's was the fail state for that match.  I ordered one or two additional squads over at like the 10 minute mark, but I don't know what happened to them.  AFAIK they never arrived.  Ultimately after about fifteen minutes of pop sinking into absolutely intense fighting on that four minute cap, Eisa Tech had been complete for a while  and Echo Valley started ticking I pulled everyone out Pale Canyon when the cap timer had gotten down to ten seconds and hadn't been interrupted.  So I tried to save Echo Valley, and fired off a hail mary into Waterson's.  30 minute mark, roughly, asked everyone if they were resource starved.  Air and all platoons were resource starved.  Waterson's had fallen and that was it.  Air dominance was critical. It shut down our ability to move and ground pound.  It nuked our resources completely.  From there the goal was to prevent as large of a loss as possible.    So up to that point I'll own all that in terms of the loss.  Some of that was strat, some of that was me not being more specific, and some just bad decision making.    The continent lock however was completely preventable.  But, by that point 40% of my force had stopped responding to any and all commands.  So we just got steamrolled.  I was talking about owning the loss with caveats elsewhere.  I own the loss with the caveat that we could have prevented the continent lock."

PS2Cobalt,3bftu2,LeClipperChip,2,Mon Jun 29 12:18:36 2015 UTC,"I saw a lot of CHI maxes during the last few days. Using maxes is of course a part of the game aswell as destroying sundies but trying to avoid face to face fights more and more isn't the *chimeran' way I saw in all those old videos. Valk/gal drop on enemy sundis, vehicle train or max pull is for me personal easy mode, or at least an easy way of winning a fight.  Would love to see some breach and clear tactics, some momentum stuff. For example use the bridge -which the masses often don't use- and throw some flashes, concussion nades or emps into the room and clear it.  It might be not successful, but its main difference to the 'sundi destroy tactic' is that it would be a challenge. At least a better one for Chimera to push the boundaries again.  Hope your goal is still Chimera reborn and not Maxes reborn."
PS2Cobalt,3bftu2,MoFoMadness,2,Sun Jun 28 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"This, we fought against Chimera today, the fights where good, but often or not we'd be up against a predominantly MAX focused couple of squads."

PS2Cobalt,3bftu2,ViperMkll,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:21:34 2015 UTC,Sadly they are part of the game. Have to fight fire with fire on occasion. While I only saw one mac's max during the evening. There were other outfits that were not so subtle with their max usage. I would rather not use them myself.   Edit: punctuation
PS2Cobalt,3bftu2,elbifo,2,Sun Jun 28 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"yep we try not carry on max in most case, sometime one is necessary ,barely more, it's nanite hunger, and give less mobility beetwin bases, my pov, not the outfit pov of course."
PS2Cobalt,3bftu2,Effrit,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping we will get back to the old breach and clear which CHI used to do pretty well (without maxes).  At the moment we have a fair trial members, newer players and not enough experience working as a cohesive unit for for the decent squad play to work. Max's in my opinion are a crutch which I hope to see burnt myself before long.  I'll point out I'm of the opinion that Max's should be removed from game or their cost increased dramatically so they are used far more sparingly.  Valk/Gal drops on Sundies was something the old CHI did far more than the Reborn. If anything I would like to do more of it with the Valk."

PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,elbifo,4,Sun Jun 28 09:42:55 2015 UTC,We certainly did much better than in the previous smashes but we're not at the level we were and it's gonna take quite a while to get there again. I'm confident we can do it though.
PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,NerfDragonhawks,4,Sun Jun 28 10:51:50 2015 UTC,Our leadership was really solid honestly. And we never were totally destroy or desorganized. GG toBlckJck and all air squadlead
PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,HerrLuky,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"never desorganized   Kinda disagree with that, cause it was a bit unorganized in the beginning. For me, the real organisation started, when we all moved to the same channel. Maybe we should keep that in the future too."
PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,Punisher_Ps2,-2,Mon Jun 29 10:57:17 2015 UTC,We were organised the whole time but when we joined 1 channel we were organised lvl 9000
PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,killALLilluminati,2,Mon Jun 29 12:01:47 2015 UTC,"first hour was not great let's be honest, if we sugarcoat it we wont be able to improve"
PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,NerfDragonhawks,0,Mon Jun 29 12:18:07 2015 UTC,"hmmmm...thinking about it now yeah you could be right especially when waypoints etc weren't followed in time, in addition what punisher said that others were running back (hope this isn't BLNG doing everything and blame others discussion tbh) i found many opportunities to push towards the enemy air when we were clearly dominating, would have pushed our victory much faster.   I'm all out for improvements, i would like to be squad lead or even platoon lead but because of where i live i am restricted from those.  All in all i am trying to get the most from KMWN members and hope for most BLNG members to also play in the air cause i know for a fact emerald isn't gonna be easy and miller will be a great contender. Good luck"

PS2Cobalt,3bcv0y,Jekyll23,2,Tue Jun 30 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"Air platoon.  When you change waypoints, we took too much time to follow this waypoint especially when you put WP in our bases (close to Warpgate) for regrouping before rush.  1 channel seems better if we are disciplined. And we should prepare ourself as if we always have to deal with number superiority on ennemies side"

PS2Cobalt,3bb9qx,SOLAR15,2,Sat Jun 27 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"I mean it looks solid.  Called back to point too early. Tbh in that scenario they shouldn't have given up the cushion they had outside the point at the minute mark, you want to collapse on the point vs 60-70-80% defending pop (not 45%), in the last 15 seconds as the human wave approaches, and only if it is actually going to get past your current position.  Tbh you could do the same thing with 6 guys + 1 sundy next to the point, maybe even less. If VS had pulled a sundy round there properly, the VS would've defended it easy. It's a base design issue, but you need to use these things."

That's all. 2 messages total and polite.  Are you referring to this?  I know the streamers job is hard with all that commentary and trying to get some good angles is hard but when you watch the stream you can make some polite request of what you would like to see. I asked Fara once to show more air game above facility and it was really interesting.  Unless you refer to someone else who was more aggressive and impolite then i don't know who he was
PS2Cobalt,3b4cn9,Chakred,2,Thu Jun 25 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"There was some pillock who went into the streamers' Teamspeak channel mid-fight and told him to sort out his camera work. Hopefully whoever it was has received an arsekicking since then, 'cos that sort of thing really isn't on."

PS2Cobalt,3b3ekj,wickedhell3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"Now that is true. I sometimes pull maxes for AA purposes and then when there are no planes anymore, I switch to AI and roam the base a bit. So far, I didn't die from archer shots, but I did trip on a tank mine. And that is a lot different because as an AI max I usually try to stay indoors, so archer is not that much of a concern (except if a player like Elusive decides to try it of course, then maxes on his server are pretty much fucked). But having to care about tank mines is something else entirely. I suppose I'll have to try that explosives awareness implant for the AI max loadout."

PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,BananenMatsch,3,Wed Jun 24 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"There are multiple ways to use smoke and keep enemies from advancing. But if you put some logic into this, it isn't the time for smoke and should be used to disoriëntate and lure people in.  The fault is the constant smoking. The enemy will also get some scopes to counter it thus making it more difficult for you and the rest of the people there to defend the point, especially people who aren't part of your ops and haven't got those scopes equipped. friendlies who are still outside will come back when it is harder and that is where the smoker should come in.  With precise smoking and a recon device (spotter or dart) you can see people coming. The scopes you are using are good enough to handle it. When a big push comes you can easily pop smoke and kill the enemy since most will not have any scope to counter it on their weapons. They will or retreat granting you some extra time or granting you the ability to kill them all.  Smoke can be used on yourself or the enemy. When you know the enemy has a specific target where you have the overwatch over, you can smoke it just before they arrive. Smoke can feel safe but actually isn't. Chokepoints are also good  for smoking but only when you can kill or spot them to give your faction mates also the option to kill.  Be aware that smoke only goes in a single direction (North or doesn't smoke at all, yeah a bug) thus you need to know from where you are putting smoke. Thus aiming it at south in the building will only hurt your non-ops friendlies even more.  Teamwork now 2/10. Teamwork when used effectively 8/10."

Any idiot can tell it was an incredibly bad use of smoke.  The fact that you ignored people asking you to stop also makes me think that you were just being a troll."

I'm not defending anybody, but just look at it from their perspective - they were trying something different. You have a lot of experience in this game - good for you. Others need to learn first. You could told the better way but it was easier to curse them and kill them.  Ok, maybe I teamkill from time to time, but only as accident (when rendering is to slow, or somebody walked on me while I was shooting; most of the time) or as revenge if somebody kill me on purpose.   And don't compare me to any outfit, I may be Polish but I play alone exactly because of the reasons seen here.

PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,Greejal,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"But you don't get how percentages work.  You don't double the percentage because the sample of kills for PL13 is double, that's not how it works.    That number is the average number of TKs they get per 100 kills, so it's relative to per 100 kills.  The fact it's averaged over 20k for PL13 and 10k for MACS makes no difference, the percentage would be the same regardless.  So basically, PL13 average 4.76 team kills for every 100 enemy kills and MACS average 2.56."

PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,RachitynowyJoe,4,Thu Jun 25 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"I remember when Slippy ordered to smoke the enemy spawnroom while we were holding the A point at Howling Pass and after we captured the base someone complained it ruined the fight. I obviously can't tell if we would've captured it without the smoke since I can't check a parallel dimension where we didn't use it. I, however enjoyed the capture.  I can see how some find it to be annoying, especially if your settings don't allow you to see anything trough the smoke, I do however find smoke to be useful in some, very specific occasions.  A little remark I would make if you do use it, always use it in a smart way and make sure the enemy group is smoked, don't smoke between or your own group. There has to be an ""empty space"" between the smoked enemy and your group. In the case of the video I would say you were smoking the inside of the building which doesn't allow you to see any enemies come in, smoke the outside instead (if no squad is trying to hold the outside). You should still be able to see the door to spray when someone comes in. Even if the enemies make it onto the A point, don't smoke the A point. Your team requires a clear view of what is on the A point regardless of whether they're running NV scopes.  Side note: I'm most of the time very well able to spot people inside the smoke when I'm standing away from it (without NV), idk about anyone else."
PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,Pestilence86,4,Wed Jun 24 10:42:17 2015 UTC,"We specifically said to you guys multiple times to stop using smoke, in the mean time while you guys are camping the balcony around the a point were pushing against the spawn, but we can't see fucking anything cus of the constant smoke. Laying down smoke in a defensive way does absolutely nothing, in fact, it helps the enemy get alot closer to you. Which they did, they where probably a couple of seconds from resecuring that.  And you got a dominating cap with double our number? Gratz. If you want to see who the better outfit is ill happily give you guys a scrim"
PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,BlckJck103,7,Wed Jun 24 09:51:27 2015 UTC,"My guys may cause commotion during experimental tactics but i'm far from considering someone better or worse. I do know MACS and i do not consider them lesser.  I think this video is rather product of excessive rage rather than some challenge. And it is rather for lulz than shaming.   And i don't see what fuss is all about. Only one valid entrance was smoked(the middle one) and every other was free to see/go. NV scope is 30 certs and most guys are able to buy it, sundy was in place for most of the video so changing loadouts should'nt be much of the problem. I won't comment on how effective that tactic was bc i'm not part of spec ops in my outfit. Probably this tactic was stopped in the middle(no smoke in the end) and deemed ineffective or unnecessary. This was not alert so a bit experimenting during live play shouldn't hurt anyone"

Not sure what the population was during that fight, but if your squad wasn't there, then others might have joined to help.  The point was that smoke works only if everyone uses night vision scopes. Unless you get everyone outside your squad/platoon to use night vision, your smoke will just cripple them.   we are trying different unusal things to see what will work best   You should now know how this worked. I'd suggest next time you try this, coordinate and communicate with your team (players outside your platoon)."
PS2Cobalt,3axmnf,BlckJck103,8,Wed Jun 24 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no.  Halo goes on and on about how people don't play seriously on live and how it hurts smash especially. Now Smoke is often annoying as hell, and I would agree with people who say it's actually quite ineffective.  BUT it's not for me (or Halo) to chose the rules of it all. If PL13 want to some serious play where they get together and smoke the shit out of things, just get NV and play along or leave. Halo especially should be happy to see outfits trying to play together and use any amount of tactics/teamwork, regardless of their perceived effectiveness or how annoying they are. At the end of it someone like Halo also has the ability to try and get the SL and see if he'll go over smoke tactics.  I get annoyed when idiots kill Sunderers and ruin my farm, but i can accept that not everyone on the server exists to play the game exactly the way i want them to. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy in asking people to treat live more seriously and adding the note; 'unless you annoy me in anyway, in which case we'll all get annoyed and TK you.'  Also: If you want to see who the better outfit is I'll happily look on the Smash sign-up and see which outfit had to only bring 6 guys?.

More at the stupidity of bringing in the whole 'Scrim us to show who's best' reply which was pretty dumb in the fact it had no relation to anything.  PL13 have always tried and always seem up for playing as team, trying new things. teamkilling them for it, and then coming back with ""Got a problem lets Scrim then, seems to have made a jump somewhere."

Not even cigarette smoke.  i remember smoke not being a thing on ceres until the server smash trainings started. yeah, Torok... Impact site, smoke training. After that i saw a lot more smoke on live.

Some clarification: Our spec ops team (which i am not part of :D ) is usually doing and testing various tactics. Not every single one is effective nor applied in right circumstances. But i really enjoy what they are doing and doing something differently is not imho bad thing at all.  Smoke is interesting factor and they were testing it. Was it perfect? Probably not. But they are practicing it and trying to get it to the full potential. As outfit leader i will only encourage them to it.  There are many retarded actions every outfit done in its history so little smoke won't hurt nobody. I personally use NV scope when i see smoke being used.  I do approve revenge kill to be honest, revenge videos not so much. But everyone is free men. And they have the right to be angry for raging :D"

The thing your guys propably outnumbered MACS 2:1 and therefore captured the base is not very accurate too, I bet spitfire has done 90% of all exp.  That does not excuse team killing altho I can see his flustration and trust me, 90% of people on this server would be far worse and more rude (including me)."

They just implemented two lines of code or so to broadcast it (Or changed a server setting if it's already implemented which is likely). Nothing really changed. If that would be the case they would've said something.  It's actually bad for two reasons: It's annoying after a while and it shames people that COULD be wrongly accused.

I've seen and heard a lot the past 2 years, but yet had i heard someone whine and cry so hard last week. While we had a vendetta with BLNG and everyone being smart enough as to stay away, you felt the urge to jump right in the middle of a 10 man scythe squad. Is that asking for a gank or what? Now, after how many days, you're calling everyone out? Not sure if that's the smartest thing, but let me tell you something else. I still remember fotalcay saying ''he'd never had such a great time flying'' because normally these guys don't survive long before getting ganked by an ace pilot, so who do you think you are telling those average Joe's they can't fly in groups? Maybe it's time you cut the uncle act and stop pretending. It'll help against the down voting aswell. And if you have such a problem with us why where you on our TS earlier?"

If you look for farmfit i would advise searching deeper for something like T0T(all 3 members at least :D ), xPWR or others. NC is not very attractive in this manner.  Yet the difference is not so definite here, you can see competitive and objective oriented outfits farm all day and tight, well squads from outfits regarded as zergfits. Better jump on different teamspeaks and see for yourself.  And of course... join Jesters at jestersnc.com"

PS2Cobalt,3aty84,Punisher_Ps2,3,Tue Jun 23 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"Scared to fly coz of xPWR   Well we aren´t the guys who are warpgated 24/7 when we fight you with equal numbers. I guess I couldn´t fly solo too when there would be 3 VIPR scythes around or 12 PL13 reavers or whatever. You guys simply can´t fly alone cause you can´t fly for shit.   Even in your ganksquad your coordination is utter crap and you are going tryhard on bailers and crash into each other, like braindead retards.  In discos stream you can clearly see how annoyed he is when you guys are fighting us or another airsquad, cause you simply have no clue, no awareness and you can only win a fight when it´s unfair (two vortek reavers jumping you, well at some point even that is failing).   BLNG bail with 50% HP   Well if you have atleast 3 or more vortek reavers jumping you than maybe I would cause fighting against something like that would be a true suicide.  Another point is that we can speak english and can aim in comparison to you guys. Other stuff already mentioned above.  EDIT: The only decent guy is disco at some point, not always."

PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,RachitynowyJoe,9,Tue Jun 23 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"I don´t really have a problem with the current server population. If we would merge with miller we would have:  Pros:   One more open continent  More fights to choose from   Cons:   More zerg fights 96+ Russians with bs connections Tons of lag at the beginning (high ping bad connection+bad hit reg) More of those air lock cancer squads (own experience) More max spam+shotgun spam TFDN+TRID+DIG+KOTV have fun with the zergs   My opinion is to not merge anything, cause that will result in a really bad server performance and playing on miller is less fun overall from my experience while playing infantry and while flying there."

PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,TorokFremen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:18:42 2015 UTC,I'm not playing much if very little but population seems okay from what I've seen.
PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,Luddders,2,Tue Jun 23 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"The last week has seen the lowest average peak player count on Cobalt since the merge, around 500 per faction each weeknight, but that's still quite a lot more than when the last merges happened where EU servers were reaching about 300 max per faction each day. (Insert joke here about 300 Maxes per faction now lolol)  In terms of primetime play during the week (evenings 7-10PM), 1500 characters online at any one point is still much more than the current continent population limit of around 1,100. It's only outside of primetime where population is an issue, and I think lots of that occurs because too many continents are unlocked. A few days ago there were 3 continents unlocked at 11am with only 150 players per faction! If they were all on one continent that would still create a decent range of fights with one or two 48-96 but also 12-24 etc, but with 3 continents unlocked those 150 players per faction are too spread out which makes it hard to find opposition if you have squad up.  I think DBG will wait until at least the end of this year before any more merges for two reasons; PS4 launch might bring more players, and Smedleys ""Planetside 2 2.0"" apparently coming September time. It's also Summer which produces population swings as some people go outside, while others normally at school/university actually have more time to play."

PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,Greejal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:10:38 2015 UTC,"I saw that thread on Miller but it's totally ignoring the fact that this time of year always sees a drop in numbers online, and we need spare capacity on both EU servers for when PS4 release spikes our numbers a bit.  That aside though, the server merges last year showed how piss poor the SOE/DBG hardware and game engine is for handling a full server.  We do not need to go back to that.  Also the last thing I want to see are 96+ fights everywhere, we're at a good level right now.  I've had enough of them constantly pushing us into clusterfuck scenarios, so a merge now would make me quit.  And finally, when they do merge the last two EU servers, they really need to come up with some way of compensating players like myself  with 6 characters between the 2."
PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,Bil0wan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:18:29 2015 UTC,Before they change the cap mechanics I don't want a server merge. Zergfights are already to prevalent. Almost no 24-48 base caps. It's either very low or very high.
PS2Cobalt,3atpmi,JackHerrr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:31:45 2015 UTC,"Well there are at least more plebs to farm on. With a low BR I could get a higher k/d than with my main on Cobalt. But that aside it will horribly decrease the gameplay.  the first point is zergs. There are outfits who just jump in the last 2 minutes of a capture (both attacking and defending) to swith it into their favor and this accompanies the second point.  MAX spam. Overal I have seen more MAXes on miller than Cobalt.  And these points just weigh too much in comparison with the plebs. And then not to name the lagwizards and Hackers (although there has ben some nice public banning)  Short said. Only the Miller guys will have a better experience since there will be more zergs for the ones who want them. Less MAXes, so they can pull more and some other things."

PS2Cobalt,3allzm,GroundTrooper,5,Sun Jun 21 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that simple. If the enemies are pushing with great forces and it's likely for them to take the facility - than yes, destroying enemy spawnpoints is top priority. On the other hand, the sunderers can be placed in farmable position, and by this I mean, that a relatively small group of friendly forces can hold enemies up there - if that's the case why to destroy it? The enemies that are tied in pointless combat here, won't attack/ defend elsewhere.  (But if friendles are contributing to much forces to that fight, it's ok to kill the sundies)"
PS2Cobalt,3allzm,Szeregowy,2,Mon Jun 22 10:19:50 2015 UTC,"But if friendles are contributing to much forces to that fight, it's ok to kill the sundies   This is usually the case, and by now we have it as standard procedure to simply preempt that issue by destroying the sundy outright."

PS2Cobalt,3allzm,GroundTrooper,3,Mon Jun 22 14:28:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't meaning you were, but pushing a sundie to destroy it vs larger numbers is not the same as dropping a few engies and 10 tank mines."

PS2Cobalt,3allzm,Effrit,2,Mon Jun 22 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"My only real issue with the tactic is the massive over-commitment of resources to do so. Engie's and medics require not only the resource cost of the C4 and tank mines ( a whole lot), but also that the drop placement be right on top of the target.  By changing up your squad comp for sundy hunting to run majority heavies you get the resource free Dumb fires and then greater fighting strength after the battle. To maximize up time and effectiveness there are certain spawn removals in which you can destroy the sundy and then begin fighting your way back to the point in a pincer movement with the advantage of hitting things in the back.  On live server with the memberships and resource boosts the sort of squad drops in the video arent as much of a problem. The emphasis on resource management isn't there. But if it comes to competitive play (both Server and Lanesmash), you will be punished for trading all your resources for 200 Nanites. Just some constructive criticism.  Other than that, good luck with the outfit. //Xaniy"
PS2Cobalt,3allzm,Xaniy,7,Wed Jun 24 01:55:54 2015 UTC,Let people post whatever they want. Holy shit guys they are excited to bring CHI back and wanted to share their gameplay so why all this drama? Atleast they are posting some content.
PS2Cobalt,3allzm,BananenMatsch,9,Sun Jun 21 16:31:44 2015 UTC,pls just from now on let the people who subscribed to you on YT see these you dont need to keep posting them on ps2cobalt. no offense meant.

Basicly some people use reddit as a video feed which it is not, its meant to have discussions on."
PS2Cobalt,3allzm,eMiLG158,2,Mon Jun 22 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"Then what is Reddit, where is its definition? And how does he spread his content to people who are not subscribed? What if i started playing yesterday and I never heard of his channel? And last but not least, why does it bother you so much? Are you unable to filter the content that doesn't interest you? For example, I never even click on any video that says ""Something something montage"" because is just the same endless stream of kills that don't interest me a bit. Still, I welcome it to reddit, because other people might be interested."
PS2Cobalt,3allzm,TTRO,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"i agree it can also be used for spreading content but where is the line between spreading content and using it as free advertisement in the sense of posting something everyday, that only a niche group of people watch? and when you posted a couple of times your target group is hit and they can follow it elsewhere. BTW if you didn´t notice this is absolutely my own opinion and others are intitled to have theirs, but that also means we can share our opinion, and with what ive seen the majority of cobalt reddit or at least a big part of it, share this opinion with me.  Edit: dont get my wrong i think people should post content for people to watch and enjoy, but in my opinion i think its too much to post every video you make if its too often, becaue the people that want to watch it will get notified of it elsewhere if they want to."

When Renzor was in KAIN, the videos posted were about the gameplay, the tips, and the general squad play in PlanetSide 2. It just happened that he was in KAIN and not in another outfit. Now, videos are about CHI, and are only here to promote the outfit by making it look appealing.

PS2Cobalt,3ak3zu,halospud,6,Sun Jun 21 11:46:29 2015 UTC,"It got to a stage where the game wasn't the game it was when I started playing it, this is the same for others aswell, and I just didn't want to put all the work in anymore. And just because you don't like playing a game doesn't mean you don't like the people you met playing it, so we play other stuff together. So you can say shit to multi-gaming communities all you like while you cling on to a game that changed to be almost unrecognisable to what it once was but I enjoy hanging out with our members and that's why I stuck around. I'm certainly no MVP so I was in it for the strategy and they did a great job telling us to go to the next base and remove any form of strategy based tactics beyond the confines of a single base.  Maybe DBG will actually bring back some of the stuff I liked about the game. Like the proposed new Alert they have on test, after a long time of being told lattice doesn't work they finally change it up. Instead of nothing but territory control all of the time, I really missed the facility alerts.  I'm not saying your wrong about 418 current performance but if they make the game more enjoyable again we may return to what we once were, a lot of our members from back then are still around and that is something we've managed to do by playing more than just one game together."

PS2Cobalt,3ak3zu,Macinzon,3,Mon Jun 22 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you a Merger story (short) I was involved in.     Once upon a time there was a player named Macinzon. He joined an outfit called Vanquished [VQD] because from research it seemed the best VS one currently on Ceres and a good old friend from WoW played in there too. After some time they merged together with another outfit called Unvanquished (oh the similarities) [UVG]. The original leader of UVG stopped playing and handed the lead to VQD players.      After some good months the outfit became too casual, and farmed too much. The leaders decided to recreate a new separate Unvanquished outfit [UNVQ] to focus on squad play again. All was great but after the Server Merge we joined with The New Conglomerate [1TNC] because they were more active. After that [1TNC] became TheVipers [VIPR].  P.S:I might have mixed the order of [UVG] and [UNVQ]."

PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,Greejal,2,Fri Jun 19 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think if CHI want to be really successful and noticeable they need to maximize their infantry skill and focus on the redeployside because as later mentioned this 'doing what needs to be done' AKA combined arms isn't that different from what RMIS is offering.  What I think Cobalt lacks after playing on Emerald is an outfit which does one thing and does it great, that be point holds.  I don't mean no shifty 50/50 pop point hold, I'm talking about 15% pop at crossroads sitting at the Double Stack on C. What Cobalt TR needs is an outfit which can showcase true ability and skill, and I think only then will it be able to be a 'beacon of hope' as so described.  As you said they are two similar to RMIS in the way they are distinguishing themselves and I think they may just fall in alongside RMIS if they don't crank up their efficiency.  The thing with RMIS is that although good, they're not purely good players and there seem to be a lot of them.  When you look at an outfit like F00L, DA, AC and even BLNG their member lists are quite short due to selective recruitment. I doubt it's even recruitment in a sense, it's more if you fit and if you're exceptionally good at doing what they do.  For a long time Cobalt TR has lacked the TR infantry equivalent of say F00L or BLNG. Now I personally think that the old Chimera was a whole lot more refined and polished than what reborn will be, however I feel that with the right decision making and choices CHI has the potential to be up there in the ranks of the 'best' outfits.  Also just a little thing I picked up from /u/halospud is that   You're going to need a good SL    Now this is personally something that I don't really agree with as I think if you want to be top notch, each member should be able to think for themselves and take up the role of SL on the fly. Beacon rotations are one of the most abused and worthwhile squad mechanics for a reason.   People need not to rely on SL's but instead they should all bounce if eachother, I'm not certain but I'm fairly confident that the top outfits like AC and F00L never have set SL purely because each member is capable of working fluently off of eachother.  Now I am not telling you how you should run your outfit, but these are things I've just picked up on after my very long history and experience with outfits from all over the servers.  But that's just one man's opinion."
PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,halospud,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting post.  I've known a few outfits that were founded on the idea that everyone has to be capable of squad leading and all of them folded.  It's a great idea but it isn't practical, the majority of people don't want to do it.  Equally having no squad leader and letting people use their judgement as to what needs to be done, with the right players it can work at times, but you need to be able to override it and get everyone doing one thing sometimes.  If you can't do that you lose a lot of the potential that a squad has to be more than just the sum of its parts.  I agree with you on point holding though.  On Cobalt it's always been viewed as a job for lower skilled squads because it just requires the discipline to sit tight.  On Emerald though, there are a few outfits that have made it a lot more than that by combining FPS skills, strong positioning and movement and effective comms.  I don't think it's a valid tactic on its own in a Smash environment, but having a squad that has perfected the art of locking down template buildings working with other, more versatile squads that could be effective, particularly in the smaller fights."
PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,Greejal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:51:50 2015 UTC,"It's a great idea but it isn't practical, the majority of people don't want to do it.   Yeah in this mindset it's just dependant on who you play with and who they are. In my eyes I don't see SL's as a definitive leader, I see them as a replaceable beacon holder as well as someone who shifts people in a general direction. E.g. Maybe this fight will do or hold this point for now. In a squad I personally value the input of everyone in an effort to come to an appraised decision. Although for me personally by playing in an outfit where we share the same mindset on where to go and what to do, the practicality is there. This kind of also applies to your second point moreso in the light that having no squad leader can work at times. I think it's less of the leadership skills but moreso the ability to pick and choose the best fights as the rest of the squad would.  Apart from that I agree completely with you agreeing with me on point holds.   I think it would be a great change of pace and excitement for have some outfits that focus on these strong efficient and unbreakable point holds.  P.S. Sorry if any of this comes out as incoheren as I have just returned from a night out."

PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,Fool-Shure,5,Sat Jun 20 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"So you say you want to help the TR, be a beacon for the community, and show maturity.  And merely 2 days after you announce, one of your co-leaders is already picking fights on reddit with 2 of the top TR outfits on the server and insulting their members.  I understand you catch a lot of flak (and I don't think this comes as a surprise), but isn't that the opposite of being mature, showing good leadership and being a beacon for the community? As in THE EXACT OPPOSITE?  Wouldn't it be more mature, and better for the TR, if you (= Chi leaders) ingnored haters and didn't go around insulting the very people you claim you want to help and be 'a beacon' for?"
PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,Diskriminator,7,Fri Jun 19 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"Can we all just forget that awfull day? It all went the wrong way. They got attacked (hey, even in my opinion for no reason, and even from TR itself), so had to defend in some way, because its hard to fight for TR when TR dont want you there. Its weird there... And we all get mad at some point and lose the calmness kinda. We all did rage least once, couldnt ignore haters and trolls...just a human beings at the end. That shouldnt mean someone isnt mature, or judge it only by that 1 action, which was bad...  So we should stop that subject as its still hot. Look at GTs comments now. He obviously got very retarded children haters who litteraly downovote all of his comments even when he just says ""Thank you"" to someone. This community is too bad and toxic sometimes, so everyone who thinks its mature, grownup, shouldnt start subjects like this and judge by it.   I for example, act often like a retard, as some players think here, sometimes I sound like Im 10, troll, rage...but nah...its just 10% of real me, having fun, and hey, I'm 30 years old. :)"

PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,J3nkin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"What do you interpret ""Meta-Game"" as, if I may ask?"
PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,xXDextrozXx,16,Fri Jun 19 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"People use the phrase ""PS2 has no meta game"". Renzor says ""You don't need a meta game"".  Meta-game is now synonymous with ""End Game Objectives and Strategic Depth"".  Metagame refers to the game of the game, or the use of knowledge about your opponent/game which is not part of the game itself.  Simply,   Some examples:   If I'm playing PS2 and I see a guy I know (Player A) at a tower fight. I know Player A and know he likes to use a beacon on the tower and a shotgun. I assume from past experience he is staying true to form. I might take a shotgun myself, or play more carefully so i don't get jumped. I might also go and kill his beacon. All of this is done with no input from the game itself, just my experience. I'm capping a base on an alert with 5 minutes left. The base timer has 2 minutes left. I guess that the enemy will mass redeploy in and do a huge max crash. I make this assumption because after x alerts I've seen that the standard tactic for defending a base late in an alert in a huge MAX crash.   The ""metagame"" of any game is usually more specifically refered to as the collective knowledge of the playerbase. Some sort of accepted understanding. Rather than something more specific to one person, although both are true.  Another Example.   On release a new strategy game always lasted 10minutes, players built up big army and attacked. People realised you were weak at 5minutes though. Then a new strategy develops and you always get attacked 5 minutes into the game. After that a new strategy develops that defends a 5 minute attack. This strategy assumes people know about the past ""meta"" and will operate under those principles. This is now the ""new"" meta, the addition of the newest piece of knowledge. People operating a 5 minute rush are considered to use ""old"" meta by not being aware of the next addition of knowledge.   By saying things like ""This game has no meta"" or ""You don't need a meta"" you're saying, you're not using you're experience or knowledge about the game. I can guarantee you if you guys want to make CHI a good outfit, you most certainly use metagaming.   Edit:  A simple way of thinking about it. If you (dear reader) and me (astute author) play 50 games of chess, one time with Metagaming and another without. Without using metagaming the 50 games will happen the same way again and again . With Metagaming, we will both learn about the other player and how they like to play. We'll apply that knowledge to try and beat them."
PS2Cobalt,3adz2x,Bocianq,4,Fri Jun 19 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"I always enjoy your responses because they are thoughtful, well worded, and show an actual understanding of the subject.  I'm not gonna respond in depth to your points as I feel it isn't needed, but I just wanna say that you're absolutely right in regards to this ""Meta"".  Any sort of ""Meta"" is defined by the players, their actions, and the counter actions taken by the ""other"" players. The developers can attempt to influence this ""Meta"" through changes to the game, be they balance adjustments, promoting counterplay (the new AM7 Archer is a good example of this), or more subtle changes done behind the scenes, like the recent change to ""reinforcements needed"".  New ""Meta"" can't be added, it must birthed naturally by a reactive community.  PS. Have an upvote for a great answer to a small question."

This is the 3 years old game, most outfits are only shadow of their former selves, from having ""only"" 2 squads in prime time most declined to having any form of squad nowadays. Even zergfits got down from deploying several platoons to one and a half at most. Not so long ago we had no continent locks in prime time and now it is constantly 2 locked(and i think that the only reason is that game forbids having only 1 cont). I don't know population statistics but i am fairly sure it is down like 40% in last year. Cobalt and Miller will have mergersmash shortly.  Those who are experienced got bored and joined the darkside of farming, those who did not are balls of either frustration or unfulfilled promises resorting to simplest tactics. There is no outfit i know which maintained their level from ie one year ago.  Even though guys move to other outfits hardly this brings any change. Every outfit is the same in that matter. It brings some fresh air but it returns to normal after everyone realize it is futile.  I once migrated across probably every major outfit on cobalt and miller(took me a year or so) either with my chars or under disguise of my alts(i even planned to do ranking videos about it but drama would be terrible). There are some differences but in the end, it is all about people and those are everywhere the same.  CHI is very big promise. Based on memories of the old, nostalgia of beginnings of this game. If i would look it on the marketing side i would say ""well played"". But also it have very tough target audience, people who want something that they do not know yet. I cheer Chimera on this task but i won't joined as i am PL13 guy in the first place and they demand full attention that i cannot give them. I do think that they deserve nothing less than 100% of someone and if i would be outfitless and have guts to play seriously i would choose them in no time."

Run it with laser and it has a smaller CoF than a Medkit. Tried it in groups against armor zergs but damage drop off is pretty punishing and needs about 12 people to make it feel strong.

PS2Cobalt,3aar4z,Noname_FTW,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:04:17 2015 UTC,"Kill stealing:       In online games and especially first-person shooter games, MMORPGs and MUDs, kill stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for killing an enemy, when another player has put more effort into the kill. An example is when a player in a first-person shooter whittles an enemy's health down and is about to kill them, when another player comes along and attacks that enemy once. The second player gets credit for the kill despite having done almost none of the work of killing that enemy. Kill stealing occurs when the rewards for defeating a foe are limited or highly desired, and many players are competing for that same reward. The term is most often heard in MMORPGs and MUDs, where rewards of items and experience points can be substantial, but can also be found in first-person shooters where players are rewarded a point for a kill. Many players feel that kill stealing is a dishonorable practice.      Relevant: Sociopolitical Ramifications | DragonSpires | Lysator   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

PS2Cobalt,3a867i,napoleonderdiecke,5,Thu Jun 18 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"Edit: because I just realised this was Zockworker.  Honestly? No, I wouldnt.   There is a reason they are called exploits. You should have learnt how the community will respond to this sort of behaviour the last time you were called out for stat-padding. You show no remorse or attempt to play a game fairly, you try to exploit an ingame bug for your advantage ... but worst of all, at the determent of other players. This also includes Grenades through a spawn shield and other such behaviors.  Also, you uploaded it ... I mean .. really?  I'd just like to share with you a post from lord Higby, God rest his soul, on a matter of exploits from March of last year:   ""That said, despite a bug not being a players ""fault"", exploitation of that bug for gain in the game or harassment of players while affected by a bug of this sort absolutely is. We take exploitation of bugs in the game very seriously and this week we've had to ban dozens of players for exploitation of this bug, depending on the severity some players received 3-day, 7-day or even in some cases lifetime bans. Some of the players banned we're all the way up to BR100, with hundreds of hours (and in some cases hundreds of dollars) spent in the game. There was a tolerance here for players who may have had the bug without realizing it, we are confident that those who were banned for exploiting this bug were doing so with full knowledge of their broken state.""   I just hope they go easy on you and perhaps might be a little more thoughtful to other players in future."

PS2Cobalt,3a4z8g,FishRoll,2,Wed Jun 17 10:57:05 2015 UTC,If it was by [CHI] it would have gotten so many responses :)
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,GroundTrooper,3,Wed Jun 17 03:00:28 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm eating my words.  I said that those spawn changes wouldn't hit live and even if they did they'd be much later in the year. With some changes.
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,BlckJck103,2,Wed Jun 17 08:24:37 2015 UTC,"It's not the full set of changes that they initially proposed, beacon hot-swapping will still be possible."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,BlckJck103,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm glad some stuff remained, but it's still a really bad change. All this does is buff zergs and nerf small groups attacking bases.  Instant action may as well be removed now as well, the chances of actually arriving at any action is pretty much 0."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Bocianq,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"All this does is buff zergs and nerf small groups attacking bases.   Does it though? I'm under the impression, that it will more reward outfits that run tight squads, than just the ones that take a dump on a base with their platoon.."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,BlckJck103,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:14:25 2015 UTC,"It's doesn't reward tight run squads. They just won't see much of a difference. They will adapt fine to using Gals rather than beacons again.  How many platoons used beacon deploy to move their entire platoon? Not many. Zerg's used Gals and Sunderers and usually don't pre-cap bases. Beacons were mostly used by small casual squads who wanted to attack a base, these groups aren't going to start pulling gals and worrying about spawns, they're just looking for easy-access fights. Before you could get a beacon and back-cap a zerg for a good fight for a few minutes, not anymore.  This patch makes defending the ""easier"" option when looking for fight. I don't think that was the solution tbh."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Bocianq,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:26:43 2015 UTC,"Fair point.    But on the other hand, it will be needed when they will implement platoon beacons."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Xaniy,3,Wed Jun 17 09:35:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I dont mind the current changes too much. If I read it correctly then I can still redeploy across the map into a Valk/Gal as long as it is in friendly territory. Will just have to do more aerial insertions. I already began at the start of the month transitioning playstyle to this. An element of surprise is gone though.  However if those platoon beacon changes go through, i think that will be the real death blow for the squads.  It will result in one of two things: Small squad play stopping all together, or outfits joining up to attack a base. I predict defensive redeployside to be even stronger then as point holds wont last anywhere near as long.  Finally, given the choice I am going to invite other outfits squad leads to form a platoon just to get shit done. GG new player experience when you get 4 tight squads of JEST/KAIN/MACS/FACS or whoever dump on a base with combined arms."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Diskriminator,0,Wed Jun 17 09:50:25 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I think the whole beacon hot-swapping is a bullshit mechanic that allows a small force to hold for far too long without any actual supply lines, but then I also majorly dislike the vehicle spawn mechanics as they make it ""too easy"" to move around the map."
PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,shurriken,3,Wed Jun 17 08:36:40 2015 UTC,"Sooo, when you join a squad while they are alrdy 2 miles aways from WG, you have to either crawl to them, or spend 10000 resources for a 1 time transport? Nicu"

PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,MoFoMadness,2,Wed Jun 17 09:40:46 2015 UTC,"It bothers me the most because of SS, but since both sides have to deal with it we'll find other ways."

PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Sotanaki,9,Wed Jun 17 09:06:23 2015 UTC,"It just slows the speed of play down and reverts to the dribbler 'ok guys, now everyone redeploy to the warpgate and get in a gal' style of dribbler live play that is a very large reason why I dont play in pubbie platoons.  Before you say it, there are obviously ways around it and have been using parked, hidden valks on the otherside of the map. But slowing down any process of attacking a base and breaking through a zerg.  Yes we will adapt to the changes, and I'm pleased for you and your outfit that you dont have to experience fully what these changes mean. Because lets be honest you have probably not done any regular cohesive squadplay on live for somewhere near 4-5 months. The closest you have been to it is moaning in /yell chat about other squads that capped a base using the beacon change.  Also, Why are people downvoting GT without responding to him, come on people, use your words. Also I wouldnt want discussion to be hidden due to downvotes. Whilst I might not agree with him, his opinions are not delivered in a belligerent and offensive way."

PS2Cobalt,3a4ao9,Bocianq,2,Wed Jun 17 13:26:41 2015 UTC,Redeployside enabled many of us to move around to counter zergs.  Now that's harder to do but also moving around the map in general is more difficult so the lazy zergs don't dissipate.   Hardly anybody wants a fucking logistics game.  They want good fights and to shoot faces.  I really don't think DBG understand this game.

PS2Cobalt,39ulll,Hundredd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:23:20 2015 UTC,Groundtrooper definitely has the efficient leading style that made Chimera noticeable the first time around.  Problem is these days nearly every outfit uses a similar redeploy/galaxy rush strategy for each base.

PS2Cobalt,39u2mr,DrXTC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:51:17 2015 UTC,Try recording onto your internal drive to see if you still get hitching.
PS2Cobalt,39u2mr,FishRoll,2,Mon Jun 15 13:09:06 2015 UTC,I get these hitches using obs recording to a second internal harddrive. I'd actually blame the software for this as the game itself is perfectly fine.  For an example check my reddit submissions for the 'transport trouble' one and check the 2 valkyrie clips at the end (can't link to it since i'm on phone). You can see the footage hitching like crazy while the fps counter in the lower left corner shows way past 60 fps while the footage was recorded at 30 fps.  Edit: i mostly use buffered recording to my RAM which only saves the last 3 minutes to the drive. These files have about 120-130 MB each. So continious recording would be around 0.7MB/s for writing - something an external drive shouldn't have any issues with at all (not speaking of my internal which can write up to 80MB/s)

PS2Cobalt,39llob,Squiggelz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"I wrote a long post and closed the browser by mistake so here's a shorter run down.  VS infantry is decent. It has it's outliar weapons and it has it's obvious weak spots. But nothing that stands high above other two factions and can't be countered in some capacity.  The short reload with low recoil profile and better starting lineup from the other two factions meens that out of the box on average grouped unorganized infantry will perform better than it's TR/NC counterparts. VS infantry weapons make it more adaptive in every situation as there is no evident deep specialisation like on the other two factions.  The downside of it all is that because of lack of specialisation and similar stats profile, model and sounds there is no distinction between the guns. Like asians, ""They arr rook the same"".  The NC on the other hand falls into the category of specialisation far better and thus feels all around like a faction into which some actual thought was put. The weapons fill specific niches and perform amazingly within the confines of their specified range and type of combat profile and nowhere outside of it. There is almost no gun that feels the same in our arsenal. It's also the best balanced faction for both individual play and platoon sized forces.  Note that i'm not saying NC is better, it's just better balanced faction. With all the benefits and detriminets that tends to entail for us.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb3XfrCtjVU <- Song of my people to wrap up the post."

PS2Cobalt,39fwb7,FuzzBuket,5,Thu Jun 11 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"The VS helmet looks great. Maybe try black sides with silver front/center piece.  The TR and NC also have some good elements in them but still need work.  If you ask me the TR helmet could lose some lenses and resize the large one at the right. Keep the asymmetry with like 3-5 total lenses, and instead of all the extra ones insert a metal cover, maybe with some seam lines going across it to give it some texture. Try to make it look practical. Snout also needs to go. I think going with a stronger jawline would be good, maybe the general shape of a motorcycle helmet chin piece only wider at the front.  NC helmet also looks good, could lose some roundness around the top area and chin piece needs some refinement.  Looking forward for updates!"

PS2Cobalt,39efbt,killALLilluminati,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:44:11 2015 UTC,They've been sitting there for 5 minutes without much happening. So if the tank next to you suddenly blows up for no reason every somewhat decent tanker should find out what happened to them.  To be fair i tried to hide as good as you possible can since i always picked the tank furthest back and immidiatly broke contact without passing them. I probably could've just sat there waiting for the reload cycle and just pop one after another.  That said - the minimap argument still stands since i was using NAR.

PS2Cobalt,39b1ew,RetOld,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:02:16 2015 UTC,=( Its a Bside from a 1979 recording of an american punk band ... it was never going to sound good :p
PS2Cobalt,39b1ew,Bil0wan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:28:00 2015 UTC,1979? well ... i have to change my verdict to a 5/10 in that case. But still i cant really enjoy punk becouse the sound is really trash :/  I mean there are a lot of music genres having really hard and strange sounds but for the most of them i can see it as some kind of sounddesign. But just having crappy sound in general doesnt count towards that in my opinion. But well ppl are different and i guess i dont have to like every music :P
PS2Cobalt,39b1ew,Ometen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Punk never was about music at the core. It's about the message at least when punk is done right.  It's somewhat similar to the likes of russian bards who basically do poetry to a simple guitar riff. The music is just to drive the flow of the composition and give extra power or feeling to words.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfPrvunzsPA Good example. MI-8 Last Monologue.  Rought translation of lyrics would be something as:  The blueness of the friendly skies I dream of through out the nights. In Belorus there is a spring But here the devil won't known for sure. Alas, non of it was dream It was the last year of that war And on the outskirsts of Kabul in flames - into revine a helicopter fell.    The cabin's filled with flames I finished my last combat flight. In the near future I await For death in foreign land. Locked in by fire ""My board is burning!"" - I Cry out over the comms. For the eternity with lifeless face Commander fell on cyclic stick. Behind my back, boardteh(flight engineer) is silent too A goddamn chill inside of here. But DshK keeps stiching here not even one - there's at least three. What idiots, why waste the rounds? As is am burning - at the limits. In life i won't fly anymore It's my end here. I've flown last flight.    Meanwhile, across the river Where in the battle you won't die A Russian mothers heart all of the sudden started ache. Alas, non of it was dream It was the last year of that war And on the outskirsts of Kabul in flames - into revine a helicopter fell.    The Helicopter Roars and Moans. He too, unwilling to simply die. We're with him out of luck today. We could have flown so much, much more. About my fate i keep mouth shut. I'd want some spirit about now - to drink it till bottom of the glass. On last journey, flying towards ground. This damn land, i'm cursing out. Throughout the earphones, a tearful cry of ground control(female radio operator) ""Board 37, Respond to me!"" Got only a moment left to live. Like fish am silent  - Engulfed in flames. It's gloomy around these part Into revine quite long a fall. A wish for burial - now that's a dream But our troops are somewhere - Far away.    Meanwhile, across the river As if the light went out around of Russian mother all alone And tears started dripping from her eyes Alas, non of it was dream It was the last year of that war And on the outskirsts of Kabul in flames - into revine a helicopter fell.    Fate has no say in matters here Though not the end i had wished for. I don't regret a single thing Just pity mom and dad They say before your death in but a moment's worth before the eyes whole life will flash. What luck of them them to knock us out And our board  unlikely anyone will find I so don't feel like dying here In fire, here, remembered her!. I want to hug her so, much right now. And want to live, beyond it all Remembered that autumn evening ... Under the roar of bullets -  peas against a wall I even remembered our first meeting I remembered it all!     Ah, Lenka! ...     If anyone got to the end here then you probably can see why it's called Last Monologue."

Mostly, this is not the case though, because of other optimizations you can make which are not possible on 32 bit (like caching WAY more resources in the ram, cause 4+gb available).  I'm currently working for a company where their server product is not memory bound, but cpu bound. They run on 32bit compiled code, because it performs like 10% - 20% faster on average.  Not really interesting I know, but just want to leave here saying more (or higher) doesn't always mean better.  Also, of-course PS2 DOES have the necessary optimizations to make 64 bit client > 32 bit client (in most cases)."

The interest was low, but like the record smash or other ""show-match"" events NA vs EU would have let servers give a more ""open-door"" policy to outfits and players that don't usually get a chance precisely because many people didn't want to play it.  To people from Cobalt; we were more than willing to play this, so it wasn't us."

PS2Cobalt,396ai0,ReltorTR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:51:18 2015 UTC,There's 2 days and 5 servers.   Any choice over private smashes give preferential treatment. IMO do another practice session so all 5 servers get access for an evening. This is coming up to a tournament after all.
PS2Cobalt,396ai0,BlckJck103,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:24:44 2015 UTC,No one should ever get preference period

Miller and Connery have expressed interest in holding internal smashes, but nothing has been finalized."
PS2Cobalt,396ai0,Xaniy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:07:02 2015 UTC,I think your getting confused. I'm not saying a server would be chosen because they're favourite.  Simply if there's 2 days and 5 servers only 2 can get the chance to play. No matter which way you mix that drink 3 are left out and unable to get any more practice.
PS2Cobalt,396ai0,BlckJck103,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"It's not true that only 2 can get the chance to play. We have enough accounts to do multiple events on the same day.

PS2Cobalt,395gik,eMiLG158,2,Tue Jun 9 11:50:12 2015 UTC,the biggest problem with spotting speed hackers are that you might convict some who are lagging because lag can cause you to move (teleport) even when you are not hacking.

PS2Cobalt,395gik,Aggregationn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid 'average' is not the way. Look at this guy's accuracy: https://www.planetside2.com/players/#!/8263461174212843265/weapons - arguably average. Also, some guy on /r/Planetside/ wanted to check number of kills during alert and one of potential cheaters/ hackers listed, was Gylle :)  I agree that apart from counteracting against each cheat separately, there should be something looking for cheating pattern. But, it shouldn't be based on averages, or not totally. For looking for aimboters it should rather check how many shots does one miss on a target between first landed and the killing one on certain distances.  After thinking about it, there was no long ago a wave of topic about false-positive cheating accusations - perhaps DBG are already working on such model."

PS2Cobalt,395gik,Aggregationn,2,Tue Jun 9 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"The problem starts with some players having really good stats. You dont have to have very high stats to cheat.   Compare this: https://www.planetside2.com/players/#!/8259705530256288097/weapons   A top tier player.  To this: https://www.planetside2.com/players/#!/5428232026855525489/weapons  An actual cheater.   The stat differences are huge, but the one with lower overall stats is the cheater."

It's a very, very bad design.  I think it's more like a Dictionnary with entries in the form of PlayerName / ReportFile with the ReportFile being filled with the name, the type of report and the details.

Now while that guy can't turn around and say it's a ""dark souls meme"", since that doesn't really have any relation to the posted content, it is not nearly offensive enough to warrant a perma-ban on it's own. If he posted other hateful comments then fine, but on it's own calling a girl a ""trap"" is hardly offensive, and even if she is a transgender person, I'm afraid the literal definition of trap clears any chance of saying he intended an insult."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,SOLAR15,4,Mon Jun 8 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard he and a few others did post other shit in that thread.  Besides that however, I can assure you that transgender people are offended by being referred to as traps. Trap in pretty much every use of the word in that manner is offensive, but the definition you're assumedly looking would be for a transvestite, a guy who dresses as a woman, rather than someone who is transgender; though again, that's still offensive to transvestites.  Think of it along the lines of calling a chinese guy a chinky and you'd be on the right tracks.  And regardless of whether you mean to be insulting or not when you call the next chinese fellow you meet a chinky, you can be pretty much guaranteed they're gonna think you're a dickhead."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,Cougarbrit,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"I think your starting to confuse the issue though, he's not insulting transgender people, he's insulting one woman.  The guy should be banned/post removed/warned, for being a dick and intentionally or not, trying to offend someone in there own post. Here i agree completely that there's no excuse for feigning the old ""read my post literally"" argument doesn't matter.  But not because saying trap might offend someone else, somewhere at sometime. Margres makes it clear he cares more about fixing the problems of transphobia than about the woman who's just been insulted. People who look for it will always find something to be insulted by."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,BlckJck103,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"The girl who was insulted subsequently deleted her reddit account and post history, far as we know she could have indeed been trans."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,Cougarbrit,2,Mon Jun 8 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but to me that still doesn't make it an issue for everyone. The point is one individual was insulted, the 500 line essay should have been an apology to her. Not on some crusade of the mods."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,BlckJck103,2,Mon Jun 8 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"From my perspective I'd say the essay as a public apology would be to serve as a humiliating or perhaps enlightening example as to what construes as acceptable behaviour in that sub. I know some people have joked that we might implement a similar practice here and I wouldn't be opposed to it.  Maybe the offenders would actually learn something instead of just screaming ""NAZI MODS"" and believing they're oppressed little infallible snowflakes.  Of course I'd never expect somebody to follow through with it and I doubt Magres did either. It was basically saying ""This ban is permament unless you go an extra mile or two to deserve parole""."

I'm also of an opinion that if you are wishing to offend anyone then you should be able to do so. As long as it's not advocating for violence against that person or group.

PS2Cobalt,391bly,VeXCe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yes and a troll might only need a small timespan before he get banned to insult someone and get to them regardless of the rules.   So once again responsibility falls on individual to protect himself either openly or through vetting people he's sharing things with.  Don't take me wrong. I'm not saying that people who trolled the girl shouldn't get banned. Private communities have all the right to set and enforce rules as draconian as they want. I've been part of some that didn't let you deviate 1cm outside of conduct parameters without getting perma banned.

There is no profit regardless if it's done from position of less privilage, less power or more privilage and more power.

PS2Cobalt,391bly,RetOld,2,Wed Jun 10 01:01:13 2015 UTC,"Words have no power.   Words have no power? I can hardly believe you could write it out without laughing. Even if we take the smallest kernal of your point, that insults have no power it's still hard to imagine you actually believe this.  Firstly, you act as if verbal abuse is just not a thing, when clearly it is. You even make the admission that advocating violence should be prohibited. That alone disproves your point as you admit that words must have some ability to influence others. Secondly if you believe your own statement you then believe that rising against those words in a positive way is also a character weakness. People who rise to defy critics to prove them wrong or take strength from them and use them improve, in your argument, are weaker for it. If words have no power then them having any effect, negative or positive, on you is a weakness in the persons character. While stoicism may have it's appeals I personally think it's not how i would wish the world to be. Clearly, words do have power, once that concession is made it now becomes a question of to what level people can get away with things.  I would completely agree it's not up to other people to worry about ""What if this offends someone"" because at some point almost everything will offend someone. It's not your fault if somone finds something you say offensive. But in this specific case it's completely stupid to argue that there's nothing wrong with going into a thread with the sole purpose of insulting someone. The difference, it's trying to offend.  It's this difference between the freedom to be offensive and the freedom to offend. The first is license to say things that you know others may not like, this should be protected. It's important that people are able to not only speak their own minds, but also have the ability to contradict others. The second however has no noble motivation, it is the attempt to seek out people only to offend them. It's pure vitriol, antagonism for it's own sake. No one who seeks to just insult someone ever has anything meaningful to say. The aim is not to speak your mind, exercise free speech or make a point, but only to hurt someone else for ones own gratification."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,BlckJck103,0,Mon Jun 8 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"I did write it in very narrow definition of this subject and average social interactions online.  On first point. Verbal abuse is a thing but it's extremely easy to shake of and it's the ""victims"" fault for falling for it. People in our age bracket generally won't even raise an eyebrow at complete filth being thrown at them or have a good chuckle over it. Those that get offended need to avoid social interaction with people they have not vetted before hand. Any sort of community space that has a lot of unknown elements is a hostile zone by default and should be approached carefully and with forethought on plan of action.   On second point. Defending yourself is not a weakness but whining to others for supression of speech is. It's exact presentation of innability to defend yourself, your worldview and opinions on equal grounds.  On third point. I don't think offending people should have a noble cause. Both freedom to be offensive and freedom to offend are walking on the same fine line as the results of both are indistinguishable to the one getting offended. Hypotetically You could build the most elaborate argument on why me being a slavshit equals to being a subhuman or you could just tell me that i'm subhuman slavshit and technically both have about same effect.   So it's up to community to enforce and shun specific type of behavior and defend those that have been offended over petty shit if it deems so. If i'm out of line and clearly being offensive for sake of offending then downvote the shit out of that, tell me i'm a cunt and move on. It's what i do to people."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,RetOld,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think i can summarise a reply to most of your points, It's not about how the argument is formed. But how and where it's directed.  If i write a post about how people ""being a slavshit equals to being a subhuman"" that's offensive, but I'm not directly addressing you or trying to offend you (although the author might not care). My aim is to give my opinion, I don't care if i offend you, but I'm not trying to offend you.  The difference is if I start writing you letters, shouting at you in the street, replying to your posts, maybe going to the home reddit of the community etc. At this point you can't reasonably chose to ""ignore"" it because it's being directly forced upon you, I'm not interested in making my point, but in finding and insulting you. You personally may be able to handle it. But it is not your right to make that choice for others who many not be able to do so.  That's why, while I think the mod was an idiot, i agree the guy was a dick. He posted his comments as a reply to an individual, with specific regards to that individual. The only person who has a ""right"" to be offended is the individual woman who posted the picture. It should not be adopted by others hoping to protect the transgender community simply because the word ""trap"" was used.  As with all things there's a line where the two meet where things blur. At this point it's down to the mods opinion to make a judgement call, but not to lose sight of their role as moderator not teacher or moral police of the universe."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,BlckJck103,0,Mon Jun 8 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"I really can't see a difference between someone thinking and expressing in general terms that i'm a subhuman and same person telling it to my face. It makes absolutely no difference to me since it's just a condenced version of the same thought process.  I wrote it to the other guy but i'm not really against the individuals getting banned over trolling her since the PS2 reddit rules are fairly clear about that. Although i actually have no idea what was posted and who got banned over the whole fiasco.  I'm just saying that it was first and foremost her own responsibility to assess possible trolling she would be getting and it was her responsibility to be the first one at the throats of her detractors. Basically every individual is to judge possible outcome they might get themselves into and avoid it if they do not have the mental strenght to deal with it.   Posting stuff on internet is like traveling into Eastern Ukraine on ""vacation"". You got to have a certain understanding what you're getting yourself into.   If Eugene was the girl:  Posts skirt photo with anticipation of troll posts   First victim: ""Trap Ahead"".

PS2Cobalt,391bly,RetOld,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"I think there's a clear difference, I've tried to explain it clearly. Apparently i've not succeeded. My final attempt shall be short.  It's the difference between someone getting on a bus or train with earphones in and bringing a full set of speakers with you. It's not about how you might feel about the music, it's your ability to choose not to listen to it.  You have the right to listen to whatever you want, to like or dislike anything, you don't have the right to surround my house with 300 speakers and make me listen to it.  Premonition is quite unreliable I find. I don't accept that people should have to converse with Mystic Meg before they come on reddit. You don't know how something might effect you until you get there. Maybe she thought she could handle it and couldn't, Who knows.   I also don't accept that coming on to the internet is license to be abused. But I will accept that it should be, unfortunately, something many people come to expect. It is not however a right to abuse everyone that appears. And that's the other side of this. By arguing that people should have thick skin you are also arguing that those people who will go out of their way to insult and offend you are doing nothing wrong. This is complete shit. Why does anyone have that right to disregard common decency for no other reason than ""It's the internet"". It's a poor argument.  That's not to say you shouldn't be able to give as good you get. But this isn't that. Some woman posted a picture and got abused for it. I find the argument: ""well that's the internet"" doesn't really excuse people being cunts just because they can."

The manner of delivery, either being a personal attack or someone giving a general opinion, is relevant as well, but fundamentally you choose to be offended or not. To some people, maybe even most today, it seems as if there is no choice. Someone says something offensive to them and they immediately get offended. This is a childish and immature response, it shows these people have no emotional self-control and are to some degree not fully emotionally-developed. For thousands of years people understood that ""Offence can never be given, only taken"", and only lately is this being ignored."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,SOLAR15,0,Tue Jun 9 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"They may find it offensive, that's fine. But ""trap"" and ""chinky"" are not the same; one is a word, and the other is a racial slur, which is only offensive. Also intending to offend and getting offended are not necessarily linked.  As BlckJck said, Magres didn't really care about if it was a girl or not, just that ""trap"" is offensive to transgender people."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,SOLAR15,6,Mon Jun 8 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"It is a slur when it is used in a derogatory manner. Just because it has an innocent alternative meaning in other usage does not absolve it of being a slur when it was used as it was.  You can't go about calling people traps and then try and defend that position by saying ""hurrdurr I didn't mean to insult them!"" when he pretty clearly was trying to make a joke at her expense. Not joking with her, joking about her.  And again, as I said the BlckJck, that girl was apparently insulted enough by the comment and what followed it that she removed herself from reddit completely. To me that suggests she may indeed have been trans, or knew trans people, or was simply disgusted by the crass bigotry on show in the sub. Whichever cause, I think Magres had a justifiable reason to believe that that comment and the user's general behaviour was linkable to transphobia.  I ain't here to defend Magres in general though, they always came across as a bit of an egocentric arse on a power trip to me, but in this instance they are well within their bounds."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,Cougarbrit,2,Mon Jun 8 19:07:45 2015 UTC,So where do you draw the line? Every insult gets a ban? No jokes ever?   And what happened to letting people decide for themselves what they judge to be acceptable or not?
PS2Cobalt,391bly,SOLAR15,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"I'd draw the line at discrimatory behaviour, done in 'humourous' poor taste or otherwise.  And I'd draw the line at people being so insulting that they force people from a community with sheer vitriol.  Making a joke is all fine and dandy and I'd generally leave it up to the other people in this sub to downvote that shit to oblivion if it possesses all the quality of a melting turd, but if it's a comment chain that spawns a thoroughly toxic set of comments that serve no purpose other than to offend then I'd nuke it; or more likely ktr or marty would first.  In this case that comment apparently spawned a set of comments so disgusting they chased the victim from the face of reddit. That would absolutely lead to shadowbans and/or permabans, as it did.  We let quite a bit of shit slide in this sub, and it's fair enough to see shit is allowed to slide in the main sub too if you ever open some of the donwvoted-to-hell posters."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,Cougarbrit,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I still don't think his ""amazing trap ahead"" reply to a guy saying ""please tell me you are a girl?"" is ban-worthy.   Someone else said ""Trannies should be gassed"" or something along those lines. There's a pretty sizeable gap between the two. One is a dumb meme, being parroted, which all memes are - in and out relevant of context. The other is a pretty evil opinion. Responding to that guy shouldn't be an emotional tirade backed by what you think is the high ground, but should be approached and de-constructed logically, without ""being offended"" coming into it."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,SOLAR15,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"There are no lines, like in everything else in society, lines are bullshit.

PS2Cobalt,391bly,Forster29,2,Tue Jun 9 10:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think Magres had a justifiable reason to believe that that comment and the user's general behaviour was linkable to transphobia.   Perhaps, but he takes that assumption and removes the individual from it all together.   Why does it matter if the guy even is transphobic? He's entitled to his opinion as much as anyone else. As long as he doesn't start being a dick about it. The issue is not about what he thinks, but about what he did. Warn him that it isn't tolerated, ask him to apologise and say if he does it again he's banned. It's simple. His own opinion and thoughts don't come into it.  In all of this the fact the some woman was offended and pushed out because she posted a picture of something she made is completely ignored. You yourself come back to ""Are they trans? Perhaps they are?"" Why does it matter? Does it change anything? The thing that matters is someone was forced off reddit by some cunts."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,BlckJck103,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:10:11 2015 UTC,"Does it matter? Yes it matters. There's more than just ""Did x happen, if so, kick abc"", there's the context and the whys. Why did she feel so harrassed that she had to leave?  If somebody gets killed, the killer doesn't just get put on the spot for murder by default, they question whether it was murder, or manslaughter, etc, and what additional charges need to be made.  That same approach is applied to most offences with any level of nuance, and I see no problem with it being applied here. It's more than ""Guys chased girl from reddit"", it's ""guys chased girl from reddit using hate speech and defamatory methods"". If they'd chased her from the reddit by just being crude asshats, that's a minor offence and she was arguably overtly sensitive. Chasing her from the reddit through derogatory hatespeech is a whole different kettle of fish, and far more serious in my opinion.  I really don't get why people are so hung up on him demanding an essay from an intolerable douchebag. He's a fucking reddit mod not a human rights commissioner, as far as I'm concerned he's under no obligation 'not to be a dick' himself beyond any other human and I think you'll find most reddit mods have their dickish moments. This is just an extraordinary witchhunt that has showcased how unimaginably crass and low-grade the planetside community is in my eyes. For a community that prides itself as being more mature than Cod or Battlefield they have a lot to be desired for in empathy and maturity."

This is not the right analogy. Murder/Manslaughter is a question of intent and culpability. Same with 1st/2nd degree etc. This is not the question here, the intent is clear. It wasn't an accident he wrote something to offend her, he deliberately chose to.  The correct analogy is hate-crime. The idea, that hitting someone is wrong, but not as wrong as hitting someone because of race/gender/orientation etc. It's, in my opinion, stupid. It's very close to thought-crime as well.  That's why I say the trans issue is irrelevant and why the idea of ""hate-speech"" is not only worrying as an idea but counter-productive in terms of equality. It doesn't matter what he believes, doesn't matter if the offended party is or isn't transgender. Because if you argue that it does make it worse, you are immediately admitting that going round offending people isn't as bad if they aren't transgender. In this case you are saying that the poor woman has less right to be offended if it's specific to her and not her gender/race/sexual orientation etc.  There's no way around it. If you think hate-crime/hate-speech you exists you believe that issues outside of this are less important. The very idea of hate-crime must say that ""normal"" crime is a lesser offence.  Personally if someone abuses someone in the exact same manner for being short or wearing a funny hat it's no different that race or gender etc. The punishment should be the same.  As for why people care about the mod, because it's idiotic. As i've said, he doesn't care about the girl, he cares about some crusade of his. You say the community lacked empathy, well certainly the idiots in the original post did, but so do the mods and anyone turning this into an trans issue. The latter show more concern with a nebulous community that may have been offended, that with one individual who was harrassed."

If you start to regulate it then where exactly do you draw the line and how do you define the hierarcy of the biggest to smallest special snowflakes. Because you absofuckinglutely have to since you can't regulate everything people get allegedly offended by.   For example i don't like a comment on this reddit, i state i'm offended by it even if it's completely harmless nobody will give a fuck because i'm a troll and cis gendered heteronormative employed and well rounded norp but a transbro gets offended by the same comment and the OP gets banhammered.  Reading through the pages of stupid from SJW/Feminists and arguing over issues with them i've got an overal picture of who stands where. It's completely fucked in the head situation in western society right now and it's going to get worse. People are basically building up cultural marxism and it's going to backfire hard at some point because it goes against natural interaction of people. Self restriction on freedom of speech, action, role in society, gender role. Welcome to the Soviet Union circa 1920 or PRC during the cultural revolution.   Fuck the RKKA even removed military ranks from it's army at some point for sake of equality but had to revert because it turned into a BKNE platoon."

I could probably school you pretty hard on the fallacies involved in that line of thinking, but you would most likely not be at all responsive to any arguments since it contradicts your echo chambers and the logic of conspiration theories.

PS2Cobalt,391bly,taeerom,2,Tue Jun 9 04:58:39 2015 UTC,"Opinions and views change so i don't mind a good discussion even if the lines of thinking don't shift much. It opens up possibilities for a different or at least more refined view of your own thoughts.  Here we go. A simple down of my views based on the thread.  Freedom of Speech is paramount. You should be able to say almost anything you want. Of course others can always tell you that you're shit for saying it. This including being offensive to other people if you wish to be so. This excludes things that might put people directly in danger. Advocating for violence & release of OPSEC intel on people who work undercover. It's a complicated subject but basic premise is that if you want to say it you should be able to.  Goverment should provide for it's people. If goverment does not then it's not a goverment worth having. Education, legal protection and social care to those in need. The laws it set should not be build around, gender, status or orientation. All citizens are equal and if a minority/majority are getting an exemption or above others protection through law then it's a flawed law.  On gender and society. I'm of the opinion that we as a species are gendered and our primal insticts, interests and what drives us is different from each other. Equality is an odd term but there should never be social equality in some sense since it's an impossible concept to achieve and it's counterproductive to the natural interaction between people of different sexes or ethnic groups. Let people interact and see what they get out of it on an individual level without hiding opinion. I'd rather talk to racist and against his views openly than force him into a fake smile and subjegation under the ""better good of society"" There should absolutely definitely be a legal equality though in a form i've described in previous paragraph.  On jokes. Jokes operate on different principles depending on where the emphesis is made but they can be as mild or as offensive as author wishes them to be without him needing to appologise for it. Even the most offensive of jokes are very rarely made with ill intent and those that do make them with such intent generally are fairly easy to spot for what they are. I've only come across one individual who not only did a really awesome joke about some minority group but was also venomous in his views about them. The rest are just people telling or coming up with shock jokes for sake of being funny harmless dicks.   On Transbro's. I don't descriminate against anyone & hate everyone equally.  On the modbro and SJW's. Whatever you might say there is an underlying and vocal movement with support and ability to influence the government policy and shift societal thinking to a degree. It's mostly operating through universities but the scope of it's effects is not small. Like all militant movements the universities and places of higher education are oddly enough the most susceptible to it.   It happened in our own beloved gaming space with the ""Gemers are dead"" bullshit resulting in the GG being formed to combat it. It happend to Atheism with the ""Atheism+"" bullshit. It happend to TED with the TEDx cancer. The shirtstorm shitstorm, the dudes getting arrested on subway for ""manspreading"" and other incidents are a show that at least in US it's entranching within society itself outside of the internets. I've used to argue with american christians about seperation of church and state and role of religion in education and honestly it's the same damn movement only from the other end of the spectrum of views. It's an undeniably a ""thing"" now as such should be combated.  Being white, being a male, having assertative personality and traditional roles view is slowly becoming something to be shunned in western society. To the people driving this it's fine to erase national identity, racial identity and societal role as long as it's not belonging to their snowflake group of protected people. There inevitably going to be a backlash sooner or later though, i'm just in the forefront of it as usual.  Don't compare my views to those of Breivik. It's uncalled for and does not relate to the discussion in the least. It's like saying that the face of democracy is DPRK."

Of course there's left-wing lobbies effecting goverenments. Just as there's right-wing ones also, and oil and renewable energy lobbies. Heathcare, pharmaceutical, industry, unions. So much tries to pull governments in one direction or another and each has varying success in different countries at different times. To argue that societal shifts of the past 20, 30, 40+ years are down to one hidden group is, frankly, ludicrous.    The fight against religion did not start in the 1930's, proposed by hidden marxists as a fight against Western culture. The process has begun even before the enlightenment, which is only increasing it's decline. Religion, or at least religion as it has been, cannot survive in a post-enlightenment world.  The rise of gender and sexuality politics can also be seen in this light. Once religion is removed why do people care about homosexuality so vehemently? Femanism may have gained a new lease of life in the 60s but the Women's rights progress can be seen back into the 19th century, predating any notion of cultural marxism.  The ideas where around long before, and would have occured anyway. To argue that these were part of some left-wing consipiracy is ludicrous. That's not to say that some theories of cultural marxism may not have been co-opted by the left in the 60s or later, just has numerous groups have done likewise with other theories. The fact they take them up does not mean it's part of some large plot.  That's not to say that those ideas don't exist of that, people might have issues with one or many of them. But tying them together with one big bow under a single name. No thanks."

But there is influence and it's at this moment of time on the forefront of shaping opinions. The feminist/radical left ideals have basically muscled religion out and become the current age unreasonable big bad. Even in the 90's and early 2000's the right wing idiots held monopoly on unreasonable shit but in last 5 years they've lost it to the left leaning nutjobs.  This in my opinion is process that started in the late 1980's and really picked up speed after the fall of the USSR and the ideological vacum in power blocks that it left in it's wake. Both the the Left and Right leaning ones. The sexuality and gender politics of today are also hardly comperable to ones from past decades, they are at their weirdest right now and the conversation between the mod and the idiot who got banned shows it perfectly.  I can agree though that i might have overstepped a bit by writing it all down under cultral marxism.

Your view of politics might be correct for some areas of the world, but it's far from a general theme. I would think most of England would argue for a right-ward trend recently, Scotland however seems to be finding it's own voice on the left. France is seeing a growth on the right. The same for every country, each moving left and right as it goes through various issues.   I don't see any discussion that's the same before the 90s and after. This is an issue about the internet however. 20 years ago you wouldn't have come across an argument between two people who know practically nothing about a subject.

PS2Cobalt,391bly,RetOld,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"Reading through the pages of stupid from SJW/Feminists and arguing over issues with them i've got an overal picture of who stands where. It's completely fucked in the head situation in western society right now and it's going to get worse. People are basically building up cultural marxism and it's going to backfire hard at some point because it goes against natural interaction of people. Self restriction on freedom of speech, action, role in society, gender role. Welcome to the Soviet Union circa 1920 or PRC during the cultural revolution.   This is the passage I react to. You want me to not compare your views to Breivik, well don't paraphrase his manifesto. A lot of your opinions as stated here does come well within something we can respectfully disagree with, but given this quote above I can't shake the feeling that this is just the same shit better formulated.   The labour youth party that got targeted by Breivik got targeted because they were supposedly cultural marxists. My friends got killed by Breivik due to his view of leftist ideology. Cultural marxism is a term only used by right wing extremists to discredit left leaning people and parties and to garner support from regular consertives based on their fear of communism.  What is being called cultural marxism has little or nothing to do with actual marxism. In academia feminism and marxism is two somewhat similar, but still different or even opposing ways of analysing society. Marxist theory is characterised by focusing of the means of production and class structures. What most people that refer to the term cultural marxism is describing when using the term (feminism, multi-culturalism, anti-racism, people working towards social change), has little or no connection to what actual marxism is like. It is not marxism to want social justice, it's marxism when the justice you want is based on class and means of production.  I understand you might feel threathened when people with a better education than you figures out that the way you understand the world is flawed, hurtful and dangerous. It does, however, not mean that there is a militant cultural marxist conspiracy going on in the universities. It might come as a shock to you but the reason a lot of people in the unviversities are opposed to your views of how socety should be might be because they have the actual knowledge to understand why your views are flawed."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,taeerom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"Cultural marxism has nothing to with actual marxism. It's an umbrella word for exactly things you've listed. Or rather the worst aspects of each one you've listed. Just because it's originated in the right wing groups doesn't meen that it sort of accurately insults the things you want to talk badly off.   The Breivik comparison is quite something. I won't take it as anything other than a calculated character hit job. Even if i was a die hard right wing member you wouldn't still be able to make it. I'm sorry but calling all left leaning people mao/trosky/stalinst doesn't fly and neither does calling right wingers hitlerites. So why do you feel like you can nuke me like that?  Problematic for you though since i view the soviet state in the 1970's-1980's in positive light, consider the last 30 years of PRC's transition a stellar success based of accurate judgement and study of soviet/russian mistake. Likewise consider that once the resources start to dwindle further the socialist state is the only system that will be more or less able to fairly redistribute resources and minimize waste product.  My worldview isn't hatefull. If it's flawed or dangerous isn't for me to decide though.   I think everyone should have the ability to express themselves freely however they like. Denying them it is denying them one of the cornerstones of western society regardless of how justified you think it is.  Denying it to them means that you are putting yourself in a position of power. Your opinion has the right to exist while his isn't. This isn't something i can advocate for no matter how just it is. Let the man/woman speak, redicule him for being a retard and move on. Simple.. Human.. interaction.  Social equality is unachievable. There are just to made differences between what shapes the two genders and physical differences to make it into reality. Men can feel almost equal among men and women can feel almost equal among women when it comes to social equality without much forced across gender behavior changes. But not amongst each other.   This is where equality in law steps in. Same amount of workdays, same workhours, same vacation duration, same minimum wage, same protection under law. Basically equal right everywhere they can be enforced clearly and effectively without going into murky territory.  Society norms and sexism within it can also be beneficial. Some aspects of sexism are beneficial to one or the other gender and i don't see any problem with this. People who want to step outside the ""norm"" should do so freely but majority people who abide and stay within confines of their natural habitat shouldn't be shunned for it either.  One of my personal heroes is Ekaterina Demina, Medic attached to the recon element of the 369th Detached Naval Infantry Battalion.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekaterina_Mikhailova-Demina She with her own efforts joined the war as still a child, persevered against prevailing opinion and norms and gained respect through her actions in the field. Respect is earned and not given and it's something that a lot of specialsnowflakes seem to wish and demand for but never really get.  My grandmother was an Anti Air Gun commander during the war. Saw her share of blood and guts walking over two years in military clothes and was glad to return to her feminine but damaged mentaly by war self afterwords. Hardest fucking gangster i know and most down to earth person i've met. since i was a child she never considered me lesser of her, never talked to me like to anything but an adult and never missed an oportunity tell me i'm a retard when i was being such.  My grandfather started the war as a naval officer being transferred to city defense on the outskirts of Leningrad before being moved elsewhere. Was part of an unit that got mopped up and was left as a stragler behind enemy lines. Fought as a partisan for months before getting back across frontlines to own guys. From what i hear an amazingly sharp man but the war mentaly cripled him into an alcoholic and he froze to death outside one night before my birth.  Both finished the war as part of 1st Baltic Front during the 1944 Riga Offensive.  The fucking gall of you comparing a son of a soviet military family. A Family spanning 3 generations of service to the state from the red revolution, to great patriotic war and ending with my old man's eight years in the submarine service defending the frontier during the cold war. To a right wing mongoloid.  I'd be offended but i'm physically incapable of being offended by shit people say online."

Using terminology concocted by arche conservative think tanks, terminology used to justify murder of innocent children, my friends, is so downright disgusting way of having a debate. That's why you get so harsh reaction from me, not because I disagree with you. As I said in my opening post, you have in the past come across as a reasonable guy with well thought out positions. This post here is also a testament to your integrity.   By calling the people you are disagreeing with cultural marxists is nothing but an ugly suppreassion technique that calls forth a lot of bad memories. I was in Oslo as the bomb went off. I got the tweets of chiildren as their friends got killed knowing they were next. I am among the first thousand people reading Breiviks manifesto. When you repeat his ideology (anti-cultural marxism), expect a fucking reaction.  I am not really interested in the argument of whether or not he should be banned or whatever. My agenda, if you are as reasonable as you usually seems, is to call out that the theory of a cultural marxist conspiracy is nothing but a conspiracy. A consdpiracy theory that is different from other conspiracies in that it has triggered a major terrorist attack. By subscribing to that conspriacy, you are agreeing with Breivik, even if you do not agree with his methods."
PS2Cobalt,391bly,taeerom,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"I can respect that.   Oddly enough i never associated the word with Breivik but more with right wing views in general.   Probably because nothing about the soap faced toad interested me. For me the word has been more or less something of a high yield munition in trollguments and i've never used it within the full scope of the crazy that people attached to it depending on how far to the right they're leaning. It is why i was at first even baffled with why the fuck am i being called out as conspiracy nut before realizing that few people here clinged to 2 words among paragraphs of me explaining my thoughts.  For me it's been always a convinient blanket term for few movements and ideological paths that should be inherently good but have overstayed their welcome and become prohibitive of natural function of society and interaction between individuals.   Movements that are inherently left leaning. Movements that i consider uncompromising, self centered and closed to debate.   I am of belief that there is no conspiracy in trying to erase the white mon, the christian way of life or any of that right wing shit conservatives like to spout. But i do consider the feminist movement, the social justice movement and the race centric movements to be in a position of influence right now beyond what they should have ever been allowed to have. Their roots in my opinion are also clearly leading to the communist leaning left of the cold war era. I genuinely feel that forcing people to conform and accept others through forced subjegation while simultaneously putting those minority groups to the forefront is in effect driving people apart. It's preventing an honest discussion and honest exchange of ideas. In western world. In US ín particular and in to lesser degree in Europe having an open discussion on race or sex makes peoples sphincters tighten from mear thought of saying something wrong getting them in a world of shit and called out as bigots, sexists, racists. The backlash i was talking about in the rise of the MRA's, the shift of the atheist old guard against SJW's and the anti feminist movement.  I understand where you're coming from though and know how things might get you heated up.  Last year Ukraine war was the same for me. I fallowed over 8000 pages of discussion in a single thread and watched tragedy unfold. Watched the double faced media reporting, the disregard for wellbeing of people and the savege reality of realpolitik. Where West supported and legitimized effectively an illegal government in a country torn by civil war, stayed silent about the war the country was waging on it's own people untill odds were turned against the western interests by the rebels and the covert support of the big neighbour. Likewise i can't be anything than dissapointed in that there were ethnic Russians dying on the border of Russia yet the state out of interest of bigger geopolitical picture and the slow game decided to avoid an open confrontation. If you'd read the russian forums, litsten to the people and then watched the news you'd realize what tremendous job and hoops the russian media had to jump through to calm them the fuck down from demanding to bomb the urkranians back into the dinosaur age. The Donbass region would be a burden on the RF and thus they decided to achieve victory through path of long burn carnage that swift house cleaning. They decided that it's better to keep these regions within ukraine on paper but under own influence for geopolitical goals and avoiding the responsibility than swallow them up with all the resposibility it entails.  So for your sake i guess i can always use another word to describe what i'm talking about since for you it's entrenched with a particular individual you hate dearly."

The use of the term is exclusively used to portray your political opponents as something they do not want to be associated with, namely communism.

PS2Cobalt,38zcsf,NerfDragonhawks,5,Mon Jun 8 07:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is I can completely understand that, in a F2P game especially, you need to make money. Some decisions will be made because ""This will sell well"" and art/design may take 2nd place to that. I think there's very few games, let alone F2P games, that have not had similar interference.  But why not just say that. That post is just 80% salt. Anyone with a brain would accept some stuff is just out of their control and that income is also a factor alongside other things, but like you said, that's just another ""Nothing was our fault"" post."

(As said on an other reply - let them bore to death). Let alone joining it for fun, as most of these bases are hardly suitable to accommodate a 96+ fight.

PS2Cobalt,38w7q2,Aloysyus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on the hill, if it's too steep to maintain traction you wanna fire it so you can gain and maintain top speed for as long as possiblewhile going upwards , if it's not as steep then you can do it more freely."
PS2Cobalt,38w7q2,Aloysyus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well, you can talk about ""hidden places"", but what i really always wonder about when it comes to harassing: Why do people drive this thing like a tank? Way too much risk, they don't try to keep the wheels on the ground as much as possible. I mean it's fun to jump with a Harasser, but being flipped in all directions most of the time doesn't help.  And then this lack of decisions. People can't decide whether to attack or flee, end up doing something inbetween and getting rekt.  But something tankers can really learn from Harasser drivers: To repair in the right situations."

This so much.  whenever I'm trying to teach people how to drive like I do, I always emphasize that you have to think about your actions whenever you have a moment, but that usually just ends up with the driver hesitating instead."
PS2Cobalt,38w7q2,Aloysyus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"That's what i mean, this hesitating. It's the same in tanks. Some decisions can be wrong but you have to make them. It is so important to be consequent in what you do. Plus so many players underestimate the psychological warfare. Annoying the enemys, being an asshole, strike when you have the chance."
PS2Cobalt,38w7q2,Aloysyus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:54:14 2015 UTC,"A wrong decision is better than no decision, as that allows you to analyze what went wrong and how to improve for next time you get into such a situation.

It is a staple of good squad play, and helps keep small squads in a fight where they don't have the manpower to defend a sundy at the same time as actually attacking.  It is easy enough to defend as it is, and this will make it even easier.

PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,RachitynowyJoe,16,Fri Jun 5 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"Allright, hello;  Let me give you what I have.  He (Ying.) joined MACS ts 2 nights ago, poking me to see if MACS were recruiting. I went through the recruitement proces and got him in as recruit ofcourse. After asking him ssome personal questions I had an OK feel about the guy. I asked him, why do you join us when you were already in JEST and KAIN. He said Jest were Jest, and KAIN is just KAIN, I won't go into detail for obvious reasons. :p  He actually has the recruitment awards (not all), eg; Ambassador title, ES Cosmetic tank weapons, black camo. It was only a few minutes after I invited him to MACS that he asked if there was anyone in MACS that could fly lib, then he asked if there was anyone that play/fly Dalton. Ofcourse, that made my Libsense tinkle. Only shortly thereafter I was made so small seeing him ONe-shot every player that I have great difficulty with engaging on my own. Without effort, every esf/lib/gal died with an accuracy that has never been seen before. And then I sensed a faint smell of fish in the air when he One-shot DrMP twice at very long range. Now, being too happy that I finnaly found a gunner again made me look for the consistent factor.  What I see when something fishy goes on is    I get Xp for the gunnerkill before the shot is even fired. Killfeed in upperRight is showing before the shot landed. Shot connects AFTER the kills is made.   So judging this, and what you people posted here (which we really appreciate of you guys in MACS, thxx) it has to be obvious that some form of hacking is going on, like Emil said, you don't get from 0 to better then Thunderstrom or bottled overnight.  So MACS highcommand has decided to terminate Ying's recruitment process and ban him from our whatevers.   I fkin knew it was too good to be true I fkin knew it...  Thanks for reading. JH out!"

PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,MyCreagle,2,Sat Jun 6 08:41:43 2015 UTC,"I can tell you it's either a hack or legit. He was in my Lib for a little while yesterday and I watched the in-squad distance figures for a while to see whether he was ping-abusing. They stayed at about 80 metres the whole time, the same as the guy in the third seat."
PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,xPaffDaddyx,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:43:16 2015 UTC,If you engage a lib and he is shooting one time and then there are like 30 seconds no shot and you start wondering why they not shot back and suddenly your dead and you saw no dalton shot or the sound. Then you know it's lag abuse.
PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,SOLAR15,2,Sat Jun 6 09:59:46 2015 UTC,That is most definitely fishy. That range isn't impossible but he's all over the place one minute and nails two esfs with two shots the next.
PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,FishRoll,2,Sat Jun 6 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"His killstreaks with the dalton are also pretty long and contain scenarios where he hits 3 or more within 10 seconds (different timestamps, so no lib / valk / gal kill).  Edit: He only has 311 kills with the Dalton according to dasanfall...."
PS2Cobalt,38q9pq,ViperMkll,2,Sat Jun 6 02:41:53 2015 UTC,His stats are god awful. But after getting hit several times reversing at render on the first shot I have no doubt something is wrong.

PS2Cobalt,38o34d,PS2-Kanjzo,5,Fri Jun 5 13:48:52 2015 UTC,The logo and font looks sweet but I don't think the slanted [K29C] goes well with the rest of the image.

PS2Cobalt,38o34d,AlphaRastor,2,Sat Jun 6 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"I like the font for its aesthetics, but I think it is a bit hard to read. Maybe seperate the core letters from the decorations a bit? The shield looks really nice There were three fonts used in the logo, try to reduce that number whenever possible (I personally think no more than one font) The angle of the tag makes it feel slapped on, you could put it below the shield and incorporate the design elements of the shield into it (metal / weathered) The texts ""faction"" and ""server"" are not needed, as others pointed out, people should be able to identify this. If you don't have restrictions on image aspect ratio or resolution, you could make the alignments more clear. There is a lot of stuff floating around (faction / server text, tag) that could be aligned better with the overall dimensions of your logo.   It is a good start, don't get me wrong, but there is always something to improve :)"
PS2Cobalt,38o34d,FishRoll,2,Sat Jun 6 05:36:59 2015 UTC,The K29C should be fonted and on the shield icon. Properly rather than slanted.

PS2Cobalt,38npwv,Aloysyus,2,Fri Jun 5 13:43:00 2015 UTC,This is not only a problem with EOD HUD. There are render problems in general. Running around as infantry? Too bad there's a Sunderer popping up right in front of you and kill you with Basilisks....
PS2Cobalt,38npwv,CptSonne,3,Fri Jun 5 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"It's the response time of the netcode that's fucked, not the mines."

PS2Cobalt,38npwv,paulus1978,2,Fri Jun 5 12:54:57 2015 UTC,No.  Tank mine mechanics are fine. Game rendering mines too late (if renders anything at all) is not fine.  It's not really clear which one you're complaining about in your video.
PS2Cobalt,38npwv,Cariol,2,Fri Jun 5 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""fine"" but the same thing that stops mines appearing in time for you, also stops a de-cloaking flash appearing for your quarry. Swings and Round-abouts."

PS2Cobalt,38npwv,GroundTrooper,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"I think that they keep reducing the render distance and allot of other render related stuff in order to squeeze out max performance and therefore end up screwing stuff like this in the process.

PS2Cobalt,38npwv,BlckJck103,0,Fri Jun 5 20:14:31 2015 UTC,A detail mentioned in the PS2 main sub that would explain why EOD HUD might struggle.
PS2Cobalt,38npwv,Shumakun,0,Fri Jun 5 20:14:31 2015 UTC,There is a mineguard available for the flash. Use it if you consider tankmines a big enough problem.   This is coming from someone who flew at least 3 fully loaded valkyries into tank mines and ded 2 dem. If only there was a mineguard for the valk.
PS2Cobalt,38npwv,LeKunibert,3,Fri Jun 5 20:15:38 2015 UTC,to bad you can only survive 1 mine with fully certed mineguard and the driver will still die to splash damage most of the time
PS2Cobalt,38npwv,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"Do you run flak on infi? can that help you survive the hit?  Not tested it, but mines are a common ""FU"" then i think it's your best bet. It looks like its a netcode issue, like on the second video it's not mines not loading, it's everything not loading. Buffing EOD hud or nerfing mines, wouldn't make any difference. To what's happening there.  There's going to be a lot more about if they buff them against maxes. Although tbh, they should should change their damage model completely so they don't 1-hit infantry anyway."

PS2Cobalt,38flac,RihnoSRB,3,Thu Jun 4 12:00:59 2015 UTC,"Its a nice vidya , some really interesting 2v1's . Dont know if we had some engagements ,even tho I didnt fly all that much lately I didint see my name in this vid xD ...   Ok now , time for some positive criticism.   In my opinion music didnt translate all that well to the video itself  ,it felt like you piled up all those scenes and then just put some random music over them.  I know its hard to sync long segments but music didn't really do any good.This has nothing to do with music taste .  Example: In ur video music starts at 0:13 ( 3 secs after both esfs started engaging each other) and long 10 secs after the video started . And the first track you used starts to ""warm up"" at around 20 second mark . You shouldn't put some intensive fighting scenes until the music itself is able to follow them.In trailer music in like 90% of the cases there is a relatively long build up , you need to figure up what to do with it before you jump straight into the action.Use that for something else , ur intro / some other footage etc ...   Also If ur using 30+ sec ( or 25 sec ) per dogfight you should  try to ""detect"" segments of a song , it could be voice , an instrument , or something else and then try to sync up the fight to those segments."

I use the shotgun approach, hit on as many girls as you possibly can. Sure you have to be able to handle rejection very good but after the first 50 girls that has rejected you you stop caring and can start trying new pick up lines. It's great if you do it with a friend and I've created some pretty fucking awkward situations. Have your friend decide the pick up line or approach and then you decide what he does. It takes a lot of self confidence but with a friend you always laugh about it after and bail to the next one."

Usually he plays infantry but he also loves doing stuff with his wraith flash and harraser , he tried to pilot ESF's but its just too laggy on his pc , he was planning to purchase lolpods ,(after seeing me use em) huehehehe xD . Sometimes (when he's playing alone) he would start PS2 just so that he can deploy a sundy and then turn on the TV and watch cartoons , while occasionally playing xD ...

My son also, just wants to play planetside with me and is always asking to help him grind directives. If you see me on a Magrider bet that one of them is  giving me a hard time bossing me around.  What I want to say is that PC gaming can be as bad as any other life draining hobbies, like excessive sports, or too much parties, you just need to make it fit in your life and remember, the most important thing is to be happy with what you do and never do what others expects you to achieve."

You will probably have to deal with a black line over and under the picture when using apps not developed by Google. Also, it doesn't support memorycard which sucks if 11gb isn't enough for you (or 27gb if you go for the 32gb version). of the tablets I have tried, I think the Sony xperia tablet series are my favourites, but different people have different preferences, so not everyone would agree with me :P"

Hand-picked for the position by Joseph Stalin in 1926, Blokhin led a company of executioners that performed and supervised numerous mass executions during Stalin's reign, mostly during the Great Purge and World War II.  He is recorded as having executed tens of thousands of prisoners by his own hand, including his killing of about 7,000 Polish prisoners of war during the Katyn massacre in spring 1940,   making him the most prolific official executioner and mass murderer in recorded world history.   Forced into retirement following the death of Stalin, Blokhin died in 1955, officially by suicide.

However, I find it biaised that you think your gaming time was pure waste and that you'll immediately find pleasure and happinness and the resolution of all your problems by simply cutting off everything. You may disagree on this (you're probably thinking ""bullshit"" while reading this) but inconsciously you're likely to think this way.  As stated in another comment, an addiction will be replaced by an old one. Or maybe in a craze you'll buy another gaming rig and spend 3K bucks on an evening, that wouldn't be very surprising.  I think that at the end of the day it's all about regulation. It's not just that gaming is toxic, but a lack of balance really is. Removing the flies doesn't clean the plate, but it does smell nice for a couple hours. (sorry I couldn't come up with anything better than that)  Regulate yourself, have some self control, or you'll end up being wasted in a bar at 2 am, wasting your time working on your car at 2 am, watching netflix at 2 am, whatever. But if you keep playing and force yourself to just turn it off at 10pm, maybe you'll start walking on the path to balance. But as a gamer, you know more than anybody how tough balance is, and that it's never a first shot on the mark.  Maybe it will though, but I don't think it's wise to just put everything on gaming's back, and it's always you who boots up the PC and starts the game.  Anyway, I may be wrong, but if that's the last time you read something I at least hope that I made you think (would probably be the first time), and I truly wish you the best for all your upcoming plans.

You may disagree on this (you're probably thinking ""bullshit"" while reading this) but inconsciously you're likely to think this way.   It wasn't just gaming and I don't think it was a waste of time. It was mostly all the other shit I did in front of my pc that was a waste of time, watching funny dog videos etc. I have battled internet addiction before and it worked out great until I bought a new gaming pc a few years later. I'm trying the same approach this time since it worked last time.   As stated in another comment, an addiction will be replaced by an old one. Or maybe in a craze you'll buy another gaming rig and spend 3K bucks on an evening, that wouldn't be very surprising.   Very true and last time I replaced pc addiction with going to the gym 5-6 days a week. But that's a healthy addiction so I'm fine with that. And at some point I will probably buy a new battlestation and make a comeback. But that's at least 2-3 Years down the line.    I think that at the end of the day it's all about regulation. It's not just that gaming is toxic, but a lack of balance really is. Removing the flies doesn't clean the plate, but it does smell nice for a couple hours. (sorry I couldn't come up with anything better than that)   Yes, very true and last time when I sold my pc it help get balance in my life. I'm the kind of person that finds it easier to get rid of everything and start over with a clean slate. So I felt getting rid of the pc was the best course of action.   Regulate yourself, have some self control, or you'll end up being wasted in a bar at 2 am, wasting your time working on your car at 2 am, watching netflix at 2 am, whatever. But if you keep playing and force yourself to just turn it off at 10pm, maybe you'll start walking on the path to balance. But as a gamer, you know more than anybody how tough balance is, and that it's never a first shot on the mark.   To get my self control back I feely I needed to get rid of the thing that is keeping me inside, the PC. Without it I will be more likely to get out and seek enjoyment. I very rarely drink and haven't had a drink in almost 4 years now. If I want to get my buzz on I use other means, weed, molly, and maybe some cocaine but mostly stick to weed. The only thing I can't manage is my pc addiction. The other drugs I do I've never gotten addicted too.   Maybe it will though, but I don't think it's wise to just put everything on gaming's back, and it's always you who boots up the PC and starts the game.   Yeah I know it's me making the decision to turn on the pc and sit there until midnight. I'm the one to blame and not gaming. I just can't regulate my PC use so getting rid of the pc feels like a first step.   Anyway, I may be wrong, but if that's the last time you read something I at least hope that I made you think (would probably be the first time), and I truly wish you the best for all your upcoming plans.

In this particular case, it's hard to say if he just wanted to test out if you are friendly or not (you were 1 bullet from death, he could not have known that, and spotting moving and flying targets especially at this range isn't easy and not working all the time) or if he felt terrible pain after not getting that 840 exp for those 2 reavers so he wanted to avenge, but I know that BLNG's behavior is sometimes beyond normal persons understanding so everything's possible.   But don't judge him prematurely before he has the chance to say something about this. This could easily be a misunderstanding and game being shit not spotting moving objects."

I mean, ofc you can say, but why would you make them and post them if you dont care at all, right? I'm sure some of dislikes are because of the quality, its 2015, ppl like real fullHD 1080p. So, get your shit together, you either make nicer vids, or post bad ones and get dislikes - in that case, its dumb to complain.  Your montage skill isnt bad. You did it nicely, and the more you make the more you'll learn and progress through them...so, not talking about that.  So, as for quality...I suggest you to look some tutorials about quality. Dont know if your source, raw footage you recorded is bad, or the final rendering is bad. So first check what is the problem there, and fix it.

Both weapons are in a good spot right now and not really op.  The godsaw is a weapon with a really high skill ceiling and it´s not easy to master it, but when you do, it is pretty fucking good.  The anchor isn´t op either and it will only become op if you get constant hs and that isn´t all that easy. But your beloved betelgeuse still has a better ttk, when you land only bodyshots in comparison to only anchor bodyshots, so I don´t see the problem. Neither the anchor has a heat mechanic or 0.75 ads speed.  For me both weapons are in a good spot right now and the change to the anchor would make it too good. So keep them, where they are atm."

PS2Cobalt,384sxi,POPCORNpr0,2,Mon Jun 1 21:21:54 2015 UTC,"In small scale fights I find ASC more effective than nanoweave.  EDIT: The video was okay. Maybe you could give a few pointers to being a better medic (not just a better lemming, those tips should be in a separate video). There's no need for new players to know that medics have (arguably) the best offense or the quickest regeneration inbetween fights, but how about these two:  First, you are disarming yourself voluntarily (in an FPS game) every time you use the medical applicator. Never forget that  Secondly, no one in Planetside dies without a cause. If you run to a corpse without checking the surroundings first, you're worth exactly 100 xp to the guy who killed him. If you manage to revive your friend first, your efforts were worth a whopping 200 xp for the enemy (+ his streak bonus).  EDIT(2?): Nano-regen device can be used to top people off faster (combo with applicator) to reduce your downtime. It should always be active in combat, since most weapons are balanced to deal as close to 1k damage as possible (167 damage profile takes 6 bullets, 143 takes 7, etc.). Therefore, even a minute heal will allow you (or your nearby friends) to survive another bullet, giving you the benefit of a low rank nanoweave armor (at rank 5 you survive two extra bullets from any weapon with a damage profile below 250, minus headshots) and leaving you free to use a 'second' suit slot."

And it's not exactly like they put in any effort to find them either, just looking at the ps2.pisu site and linking it here like a fucking bot, woopdidoo.  I don't even understand the whole obsession some have with statpadders. If you want to look for something, at least look for cheaters who ruin the game for others. Statpadding doesn't even affect you. Holy shit someone got an auraxium weapon, a slightly better k/d or some certs. The end of the world is near!"
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Fool-Shure,6,Sun May 31 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"For me it's about principles. Directives are something a lot of players go for and statpadding is just blatently cheating. Where is the difference in haveing your fights ruined by cheaters or the grinding for directives?  Personally - even if i got that title - it was never my intention to keep this going. I just wanted to let stat padders know that there are people who care and will watch and report. And i want statpadders to know that people get banned for it.  And another topic: Quite a few of the stat padders are people who exploit, flame, report for bullshit and whatnot all the time in the first place. I know this will never stop but it is not my intention to let people trashtalk, exploit and statpad all the time while keeping my mouth shut about it."
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 31 22:12:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, this question:   Where is the difference in haveing your fights ruined by cheaters or the grinding for directives?   Is butt-fucking retarded. If you can't see the difference between someone ruining a fight by sitting under the ground headshotting everyone at an SCU, and someone in a cave with a friend on an empty continent reviving each other, I really feel bad for you and your parents.  Second of all, care all you like. Report them all you like. Tell their outfit leaders all you like. But posting it on this subreddit DOES NOTHING but fill the reddit with spam. It's not like there is anyone here that can do anything about it.  And one more thing to note: even the devs don't care much about statpadders. They could easily find all of them, with all the stats they track in this game. But it's such a low priority for them that they hardly do anything about it. So if the creators of this game think it's pretty harmless and not worth their time, why the hell are you and others here so obsessed about it?  Cheaters and bug-abusers ruin other people's ingame experience. Statpadders don't ruin anyone's game. In a 32-player server, they kind of fuck their team by not participating, but in a game like Planetside? They are just doing something that doesn't affect anyone. How does it affect you in your Vanguard if someone on a different continent is reviving a friend? It doesn't. Unlike someone aimbotting with a dalton above your head. That will certainly affect your game experience. See the difference??"
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Fool-Shure,12,Sun May 31 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Shure you know i respect you and all. But you gotta understand one thing: Don't talk to me like that. Seriously. I am in no mood - and won't ever be - arguing with people like that. That is what i am really sick about. All that ""i fuck your mother"" and ""stupid shitter"" and whatnot bullshit from seriously retarded people. And now someone with whom i never had a problem with talks to me like a 14yo teenager with sentences like ""I really feel bad for you and your parents."""
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 31 23:20:52 2015 UTC,"Ok I admit I did word things strongly there. But keep in mind that that was only the 2nd part of a sentence starting with 'if'.  It just really pisses me off when people can't discern between statpadding and cheating. They get so carried away by the 'hunt' that they can't even think straight. And everyone should be banned. BANNED I tell you. While game developpers are usually a lot smarter about it than some players.  Compare it to traffic violations. Going 5kph over the speed limit on the highway, or parking in a no parking zone is against the rules. But it's not the same as running someone over while drunk driving. For the first, it's the police's job to catch these people. It's not up to the public to do anything about it. For the second, it's everyone's job to act. If you know someone ran someone else over, you have to turn him in. But don't be a dick calling the police for someone who just parked over white lines to get some cigarettes.   In a different time, in a different game, I started a community anti-cheat program with 2 friends. The game was overwhelmed with cheaters, so we pulled their stats from the api, and ran a banlist on our webserver to which private server owners could subscribe, and then everyone on our banlist (thousands of cheaters) got autokicked if they tried to join their gameserver.  We wanted to make it a community based project instead of just something by Fools to give it more validity. So we ended up with idiots who also wanted to ban statpadders. That was easy enough with our system, just pull those data and add them to the list. But here is the thing: should someone who once statpadded for an hour be permabanned on all private servers for a game? I don't think so. If I catch someone statpadding on one of our servers, I'll permaban him on our servers for lack of respect. But I don't think he should be permabanned from the game. Even the devs don't think someone should be permabanned for statpadding. I don't care if someone statpadded on an empty official server because he wanted to get a better gun. I even welcome it, I'd rather fight someone with decent weapons than be the guy with all the kit fighting players with starter weapons.   But, you know, it was the same shit. 'Statpadding is cheating and we should ban them all'. 'It's about the principle, and I'm a principally kind of guy'. Right. So now the guy who drove a bit too fast gets the same treatment as the drunk roadkilling maniac. Nice principles. Now a guy who got tempted to statpad to get that one weapon, but has always played fair against other players, gets treated the same as the moron who bought a cheat and used it in pvp. And that pisses me off. It's not right. Statpadding is not allowed, but it's harmless and it only affects the game company. It's their job to handle it, not ours, and more often than not, they don't even care.  They broke the rules, but this never affected anyone of us. They just got a few more certs. Just like someone who buys a booster. That's the extent of their 'cheating'. Or maybe they finished the directive without actually completing it on all weapons. Again, this does not affect you in the slightest. Not one bit. So, just kill them if you see them, and report them to DBG if you must, but for the love of god stop this whole reddit crusade already."
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Fool-Shure,5,Mon Jun 1 01:09:32 2015 UTC,"You are little overreacting about us who care about padders. You sound like we dont care about cheaters and real problems in this game. Real problems = bigger problems.  No, we do care. I for example, like to hunt padders. I make them stop. But only after Im bored, and still have more time to play. As I dont play any other game. But, ofc my priority are cheaters and bugs...I log to that faction with cheater even while Alert, because he is ruining whole server's fun. You can ask others... Also, I keep tking VS cheater untill I get 5 wep locks...also with some other guys, one KAIN did came to VS and stayed with me more than a half hour chasing his ass... But yeah, I cannot close my eyes and continue playing, I have to do something...beside reporting.   Also, you sound like its not the problem, its nothing special... It is, and its against the rules. Thats enugh for me. But they also insult us all, and the game. Its not just stats... Remember when you were BR15ish...starting to play this for the first time...tryharding to get ranks, exp, kills...then wanted to get better score, then to aurax all weapons...it lasted long and it was a long journey...well, now some smartasses appear and get all that in 1 night for FREE. Like I loved to aurax MKV for fuck sake... Idk about you, but I feel offended...but then again, we are all different, so you have to realise there are some ppl who wont close their eyes on abuse and some actualy like doing something about it.  But yes, God yes, the post spam rly needs to stop. When I said I like to hunt them, I did it in silence... When I get bored, I look at fisu...and I didnt post any of them, and I did hunt a lot of them. Didnt say it to almost anyone... Untill that Briggs guy came and posted here...then I replied on others posts about padding...but srsly, eventhough I kinda like this, the fact that we all get along as a community and agree on 1 subject, is cool, but cmon, 5 posts a day..."
PS2Cobalt,3802wq,Diskriminator,0,Mon Jun 1 08:25:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should reconsider taking a break or stop playing planetside 2 if it has come down to you going around chasing cheaters and statpadders.  I thought ps2 was boring as hell in the end before I stopped playing it. Grinding for directives in which I found no fun in doing, except that it felt like ps2 had some kind of purpose again. I had  played all factions, almost become as good as I can be in all vehicles and as infantry. There wasnt much left to do than to grind directives. I cant speak for everyone who recently has gone obsessed with catching statpadders, but I truely think that it is a result of being burnt out and bored of the game itself."

But like I said, I play and have time only for 1 game...and I dont like others much.

PS2Cobalt,3802wq,HerrLuky,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"First: I appreciate and accept the apology:  To the topic i just have to say that feelings about certain things can differ. Driving 5 mp/h above the speed limit is imo not a good comparision because driving is not a game, it's about saving someone's life to go with the speed limit. And - fortunately - a lot of drivers are able to see how fast they can go at certaind aytimes and whatnot. It is for all those who can't why we need big fat signs with speed limits.  Coming to the game: What you describe is something you can accidentially do at some point. It sounds like this ""shoot in the air in the WG and give a squadmate resupply XP"". But these guys don't drive a few mp/h to fast and whatnot. They spend day after day padding their stats other people need weeks and months for. You don't care much about directives - i do because this is my meta atm, this is what the game has left for me having a goal when the fights are shit and the zerg is strong.  People in your outfit run around with medkits like drug addicts to pad their spm with certain weapons - and that is fine and completely legal. But then hearing about statpadding sessions just being so much of an imposture than speeding a bit? These guys get themselves an unfair advantage when it comes to my meta - going for directives. I can live with people like Giggo and Kuni outrunning me there - they earned it.  But what i am really, really sick of is these people who run around with/in all their auraxium stuff without barely doing anything for it. Even worse: Couple of them are quite the hypocrites. Who trashtalk everyone how bad they are, how they are cheaters, gankers, exploiters and whatnot. 2 Days later i see them killing someone 600x in a row. These people are the cancer of this game.  And about bans: I stated quite some times that i do not care about bans. I want the padded stats being reset but unfortunately DBG goes with tempbans. Like i would care - a 3 day ban for stats that i can't get in weeks or months.  About DBG not caring for statpadders: I would be careful with that. I remember very good when most BLHR VS alts still were in TRJA and one of those guys was going tryhard for H4dm4ster a whole day. He eventually got killed a lot (in normal combat situations - i was in TS and his squad most of the time) - resulting in a tempban for him AND H4dm4ster because - hey - being in the same outfit made this a statpadding session. The false positive was pretty obvious but as you can imagine: ""case closed!"""

I was planning to make something simmilar but I need some footage from other folks as well since my PC ( combined with PS2 hitching/stuter in general ) cant handle PS2 on Ultra ( all things maxed out)  smoothly.I do have around 30 - 45 FPS but framerate drops to like 1 ( or even freezes) from time to time  ( along with more input lag being generated ) essentially making my footage useless sometimes ( unless I start cutting more than I need).  If someone has an INI file , with somewhat HIGH gfx settings that are (lets say) optimal for normal performance , and almost maxed out graphic quality ,feel free to send it to me.  Ever since the texture nerf there has been little to no reason to keep textures on ULTRA ( I suppose this is still the case ?) So my question is are there are some other things which can be reduced without impacting visual quality too much ?  PC specs : Intel Core i5 2500K @4Ghz , GTX 650 TI , 8GBddr3 ,  Samsung SSD 840 EVO  ..."
PS2Cobalt,37yo7d,RihnoSRB,1 point,Sun May 31 16:11:30 2015 UTC,Hiya mate. I've been in hospital for 2 weeks and had surgery from a collapsed lung (hence the delay in releasing this!). I've only played a few times since being out and haven;t had a chance to play with any setting's since the change. I am now GPU bound I can see that much but need to clean the graphics card (dust build up - bloody killer that!) before I can open it right up and find some new setting's to run with. Will share the results once I found something that seem's to work.  I do have some left over footage but it's Gig's worth of data (filming unscripted mean's I pick up a lot of not so interesting stuff during a shoot looking for that 'perfect' moment). Will see what I can do about uploading some of that to make available for use :)

PS2Cobalt,37uqi2,TorokFremen,3,Sat May 30 22:26:38 2015 UTC,http://ps2model-axiom.rhcloud.com/#dmg/la/1 HF (soft point ammo not available for mkv & ns7 on this site so ns-7 damage = mkv with soft point)  The thing is that the TTK with both are slower and at CQC they will never beat a cyclone or eridani but their downsight accuracy make them fucking strong for medium range
PS2Cobalt,37uqi2,halospud,1 point,Sun May 31 07:42:20 2015 UTC,More DPS than the NS-7.
PS2Cobalt,37uqi2,h4ppyj3d1,1 point,Sun May 31 04:09:00 2015 UTC,Only before 14.4 meters considering ROF and damage drop-off.  After that NS-7 has more DPS and has much better recoil due to lower fire rate and better horizontal recoil values.
PS2Cobalt,37uqi2,K7G5,1 point,Sun May 31 06:15:34 2015 UTC,That's the perfect SMG range anyway.

If a platoon loses it focus and leadership completely, disband it.

But I think it also shows you people were willing to help, many more than i would have thought.  The problem is that most people have said the same thing; ""I'll help you sure but . . "" usually they then want you to make a concession, to acknowledge something, to show that you genuinely know there's some things to do to help improve. If you want MB1's platoons to get better you need to realise they're not good enough. If you want people to invest their time they need to see it's going to be worth it. They don't want to have to argue over every piece of feedback they give you or every change they would like to make.  This is where the party line of ""We do that"". Just turns people off. When you get feedback you need to accept it, if you don't, then you can ask a question. But as soon as you say things like ""yeah that's what i thought"" or ""Yeah i was doing that but . . ."" you send huge negative signals that you have no interest in the feedback and no interest in using it."
PS2Cobalt,37r9p5,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Sat May 30 14:21:15 2015 UTC,Hm sorry but the feedback you've given is already implemented in the platoons I do. The main thread was about recruiting new leaders anyway. I'm more for seeing other people do platoons and see the differences
PS2Cobalt,37r9p5,BlckJck103,1 point,Sat May 30 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"Leaders usually like to lead.  I, like others, wouldn't mind leading an MB1 platoon any time you want. But i've got no interest in just being filler for your outfit, the fact you won't take any criticism tells me that if i led a platoon you'd just bitch at me after.  If I come and lead we'd do it my way, It would be public and anyone not following orders gets kicked and any Sl not do their job is replaced, if the platoon fails to meet a standard that's workable it's disbanded."

DHMR have always had this weird perception of F1S7, not helped by Slippy's constant trolling, but in terms of creative tactics and squad discipline they're streets ahead of almost everyone else.  You can say what you want but I'm still proud that I played for them and maybe played a part in their development.  You say that they were a zergfit but I can remember them capping underpopped every day, dividing squads across multiple bases to maximise impact and successfully back capping zergs.  Can still remember capping the Ziggurat with one squad, 20% pop, while we were training for MergerSmash.  That remains my favourite base cap :)."
PS2Cobalt,37r9p5,SerafineSilverstream,2,Sat May 30 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"I had the same perception of F1S7 back in RMIS, in the DHMR it only became stronger maybe, because I was bussy with different things back then.  I do admit, that I rarely go and see ""who the hell is capping underpopped this and that base"", simply I don't want to add myself to an overpop and break my own rules, so everything you say might be true.  But, if I see a F1S7 squad, it's mostly bunch of maxes and heavies with shotguns, sorry, but that's not the way to impress me.  However, if there was really a major change, good thing to hear."
PS2Cobalt,37r9p5,Rangerdanvers,2,Sat May 30 09:32:44 2015 UTC,I can feel a pintle shotgun lecture coming on (love you pintle :X.)  You're looking at Planetside in a really narrow infantry skill kind of way though and that's never been their strength.  They do have some good players but they've always been open to anyone that can follow orders in terms of recruitment.    They get the best out of people with a combination of very good leaders and squad discipline.

In my opinion, at least the max part, isn't as bad as you describe it to be. Your TR and VS have both more max usage (5%) than I do (2%). If Gotohellwithsmilee is your NC account, it has even more max usage (12%) than Slippyfist69 (7%).  It's not all about how often you pull them though, it's how and when you do."

You take the people who are interested and use the rest as canonfodder. It's kinda the same for the Jesters. People who won't even come to a TS are not playing the game with serious intentions towards the game itself and the community. Every gaming community uses some kind of voice comm tool. It's not uncommon.   All you can do is advertise the TS in the Platoons and everwhere else like:  Join the Jesters(Teamspeak) @ Jestersnc.com   ;D

Choon plays it and talks about it in great detail trying to make it bigger thing on NC that it actually is. I'm sure around 80% of seasoned players who try playing a Cyclone HA do it because Choon came buckets over it some time back.  Personally think that an SMG on a Heavy Assault seems like a downgrade. Sure if you want to shrek some scrubs it could work but overal it seems like a shitty carbine on a class that has access to EM6, SAW-S and God Saw. I think i'll pass on a cyclone and stick to actually good guns for the class and the role it's supose to fill."

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Aloysyus,8,Sun May 31 15:38:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't care that the 0.75 gets removed (play mostly nc lately anyway) but compensate by giving it better hipfire (which every other LMG gets aswell anyway)? They should have nerfed the LPPA instead cause that is imo actually op but now its like the LPPA/Scythe is the only good thing vs has left.  I already prefered the Anchor before these changes but if this goes live the nc will also without a doubt have the best LMG in the game.  Also look at all those other changes. The only change that seems decent is the rhino.
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Vraccas24,-1,Thu May 28 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"The only good thing? Come on... i played enough VS to know that is not even close to be true. The Magrider is a beast (if used correctly), the Scythe as well. The LMGs are still very good with 0.5 - The NC infantry weapons are strong with headshots. But you still have the accuracy and the fire rate. There is a reason why VS has all these HA running around. But i still think the Betelgeuse is too special, NC and TR need something special as well. It is pretty clear that so many grind for that weapon which results in VS HA spam."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Aloysyus,11,Thu May 28 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"NC and TR need something special as well   Well, they got their players ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)"

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Sightilicious,4,Fri May 29 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"I can't say too much about TR beside their LMGs cause I didn't play the other classes on TR a lot but VS LMGs are definitely gonna be the worst after this changes (.35 moving cof) .   The NC has a much better arsenal of ARs and carabines and the TR isn't really known for crappy ARs/carabines either, so why play vs infantry?"
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Aloysyus,2,Thu May 28 23:58:56 2015 UTC,Because the LMGs are still very good? Because the AR are still very good? So many guys act like VS weapons would be worse than TR/NC weapons now instead of just seeing the fact that they NEED a re-balance. Should we just keep the current state and live with VS HA spam until the last PS2 server is deactivated?
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Sightilicious,3,Fri May 29 00:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's not about good/bad it's about how they are compared to the nc/tr counterparts. They are not good compared to anchor/cyclone (like really) and carv/msw-r are straight upgrades from the orion.  Don't get me wrong orion/bg definitely need to get balanced, but they aren't balanced this way."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Aloysyus,0,Fri May 29 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"Well, from my experience the 0.75 has always been a thing. I mean... 750rpm on a HA weapon combined with movement speed. Let's say i have the Anchor: how am i supposed to win against an even skilled player? Landing headshots against a target that moves so much faster than me?   Maybe you have a better idea to re-balance it and Burness is explicitely asking for opinions."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Nuklartouch,5,Fri May 29 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I won't waste time giving devs feedback cause all they do is ignore it anyway.   If 2 top aimers face each other, the one having the anchor will win. Sure if 2 crappy aimers face each and shoot each others testicles  the orion would win.  And 0.75 isn't great for dodging bullets, its great for peeking. I don't mean to offend anyone but I always wonder how bad people aim that they have trouble tracking someone in this game. 0.75 mov. ads or not, u will still move insanely slow while ads'ing and it shouldn't be a problem for any somewhat decent aimer to track someone with 0.75."

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,TorokFremen,4,Fri May 29 01:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah cause that's how game balance should work.  If a faction has anything good, ever, then it should mean they have to get shafted by poor game design/balance at least once in the future.  Seriously it's been like 2 years, maybe they should focus on making a good game? No your right, it's much better if ""balance"" is just a rotating series of over-nerfs to ""punish"" factions for ever having anything that their players had the temerity to use.

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Sotanaki,1 point,Fri May 29 11:19:05 2015 UTC,"There's very few people who have much of a KD difference between weapons. Look at what i wrote about solaris' stats. Over all LMGs his KD difference between .75 and .5 LMGs is 0.12.   Some people might think it of course, but if you can get a 4 KD with Orion you can easily get 3.9 with Pulsar or Polaris.  The biggest effect this change has is competitive play. Live will only change if there's a lot of alts that run to NC for Anchor/Cyclone."

It more clearly defines their role rather than just being the LMG that most people always use.  My complaint would be that this probably doesn't give the TR enough for the LMGs to be balanced across factions.  The changes are fairly minor, but people aren't going to think ""Let's pick TR in scrims and Smashes now!""  They're going to go NC all the way."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,FishRoll,1 point,Fri May 29 07:48:39 2015 UTC,Didnt they nerfed hipfire like 1 year ago on majority of LMGs?

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Aloysyus,6,Fri May 29 00:03:33 2015 UTC,Because I started as VS in 2012?
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,BlckJck103,-3,Fri May 29 00:09:10 2015 UTC,Doesn't explain why these 3 weapons are your main weapons. My main was the Gauss Saw because it was the starter weapon. Since i started using other weapons i barely played one to more than auraxium. But you have 10k kills with Orion and BG. For me it just seems like someone getting his favourite toys nerfed and is upset about that. I would be open for discussions but right now i really think that you and other players are just too biased to have that discussion. Heck they nerfed my beloved Harasser and although it was IMO overnerfed i always said it needed a re-balance. How is it not obvious to you how the VS HA is overused and overperforming in this game with these weapons? You think these numbers just come from spandex trousers?
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Sotanaki,8,Fri May 29 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"Removing 0.75 is fine, but it leaves turds of LMGs behind, that do need big counter changes, if you don't see that objectively, I can't help you.

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,CeresK1ng,1 point,Fri May 29 01:08:03 2015 UTC,I have 4k kills with Hacksaw because i don't care about Maxes. When i spawn a Max i do it do kill other maxes - and Hacksaw ist best for that.
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Sanguycarpe,7,Fri May 29 11:51:24 2015 UTC,"Solaris LMG Stats, Weapons with 2k Kills:  0.75 LMGs  Orion - 2.6 KD // BG - 2.9 KD // SVA - 2.3KD  Average KD - 2.6  0.5 LMGs  Flare - 2.5 KD // Ursa - 2.6 KD // Polaris - 2.3 KD // Pulsar - 2.5 KD  Average KD - 2.47  People need to realise most people aren't complain cause it'll ruin there farm. It won't effect it. They'll learn the next best LMG and still be fine. It's because it's a lazy change. They're removing .75 because people bitch, and not providing any replacement for the fact that without it all those LMGs are straight downgrades to TR and NC. Remember these guns got nerfs to keep them inline with .75.  If you want to remove the thing that's keeping them competitive then they need counter buffs to make up for it.  These changes just mean you'll see more and more Anchor and Cyclone heavies and people slowly spread the word about how good they already are, and the fact that it's only getting better."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,RihnoSRB,6,Fri May 29 12:27:11 2015 UTC,"They're removing .75 because people bitch   There's a reason for all this bitching, a HEAVY class carrying a HEAVY weapon moving as fast as SMGs on a light assault...  But yeah it's donne pretty poorly and without its .75 the Orion isn't that great (I would still pick it up because I like the weapon, VS scopes and the recoil (and the overall weapon feedback))"
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,MartyJC,-2,Fri May 29 01:55:38 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that k/d is the right indicator. My k/d with the Anchor is worse than with most of my medic weapons. And the VS LMGs are not in line with the others, and that's why you see people playing them so much. It's not only the movement speed, it's also accuracy and RPM. Also i still don't get the ""anchor OP"" part and always comparing the Cyclone - which is an SMG - with the LMGs. It's not like the Eridiani is a bad weapon.  If you see the VS LMGs underperforming in the test i would be surprised but you can feel free to make suggestions. But the LMGs do need a re-balance and that is kind of very, very obvious."

How about spending some time looking at the Polaris, the EM1, the Rhino. Loads of people are probably like ""Yeah Orion got Nerfed"", well what's next, the next FOTM gets nerfed, and the next, and the next. In the end we have the same weapon carbon copied 20 times over 3 factions. Good we've balanced the game by removing everything different. Phew."

PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,DerpsterNC,0,Fri May 29 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"look i don't mind a bit of variety.   Give NC the shotguns we were promised on every class, every range and every facility. Dont forget the old timer NC maxes that weren't baige but crimson from all of the slaughter they wrecked upon the fields of battle. I want those for ""variety"" and colorful nature of /yells that will decent upon my screen.  Here's my opinion. The Orion/Guisse and SVA are not overpowered on their own but the movement modifier fucked me over hard on few occassions because clientside. If the game worked properly then there would be no issue with thoes weapons but it doesn't and thus it provides an advantage that other LMG's do not have.  Even in it's nerfed form Onion/JewsGoose will hardly be a bad weapons although i definately see your concern with blanket nerfs like these.   To say that it's baige when all three starters even without movement modifiers are world appart is a bit dishonest."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,elbifo,1 point,Fri May 29 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it's going that way. If very slowly. There's still a lot of differences in the game, but I think the aim should be to keep adding more and especially keep those that are in.  Thinks can be different without being OP as well, a nerf to .75 LMGs doesn't need to be losing .75.   I don't mind an Orion nerf, I don't mind if they take off .75. But lets keep them different. For example, remove .75 but only apply the hipfire buffs to VS LMGs and give the BG a laser. This way we still have a faction trait built around mobility, and there's now more support for playing differently. You could also keep .75 but nerf the accuracy/recoil even more.  Their current nerf essentially takes something out of the game (.75 LMGs) and doesn't replace it with anything. Nerf them a bit, fine, but try and keep those differences in and also redesign some of the LMGs that never get used and actually put different things into the game."
PS2Cobalt,37nkqq,Nuklartouch,1 point,Fri May 29 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"Even if you remove the .75 movement modifier the Orion remains a very solid ""starting"" LMG. It's also getting tweaks in it's recoil that might not offset the loss of .75 but they're buffs never the less for a very good LMG.   The pulsar is getting extended magazine and will fill up the squad support role nicely. The choice between a starter or a small investment to extend close range squad support role have been astablished with this an now there is a clear choice between your needs rather than the obvious ""stick with orion, pulshit is shit""  I'm not that femiliar with VS LMG's but it clearly doesn't seem like doom and gloom some of the VS players are trying to portray. Anchor buffs make no sense, Saw buff isn't necessary but a welcome surprise."

I was expecting something more tho ... Heck I think even small instanced TDM 64/64 mode , 24/24 would be better than this. Infantry shitters dream , perfect for those who cant stand combined arms gamplay  and prefer COD like infantry exclusive experience / gameplay  or for outfit scrims.  They need to spice things up , making resources cheaper definitely isnt a good thing , they can limit them to say 2000 ( less or more , depening on some other stuff ) and once you spend them you get no more .   To be honest I was hoping for some sort of ""Exterminatus"" , ""Total annihilation"" game mode , basically something that would be radically different than the current conquest ""mode"" (live gameplay) , where the primamry goal would differ from the current one which is ""lets cap everything"" . It could be allot of different things , BF2142 had an interesting TITAN gamemode or  some sort of battle royale - PS2 style . Dont know how can people overlook this  , it would create insane fights  ... You would litteraly have dynamic fronts spontaneously created all across the map .    *The more I play planetside 2 the more I realize how focusing PS2 to capping points and nothing else ( combined with somewhat bad / impossible to balance base design )  kinda downgraded the potential and overall epicness of the game itself and at the same time created game play holes (spawncamping)  and pointless time sink due to capture mechanic being constant and not being more dynamic. *   However since they stated that:   We are excited about having a sandbox to start playing in. This will open the door for many other types of game play, without affecting the core game.    We can all conclude that this is basically a ""meta"" sandbox / lab experiment. They will test and see how it performs , draw some conclusions from it and hopefully create something better , for both live and this game mode."

PS2Cobalt,37mphu,TorokFremen,1 point,Fri May 29 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"This is a really good idea.  Pity the reality and execution of it are so terrible.  It has the possibility to have a strong meta game develop around it. Much of whats bad about PS2 alerts such as redeployside and plebs ruining it. Is mostly gone.  MAXes are still in, but you have to move them around, that requires serious fucking effort in the long term. It also mixes lattice with hex in an interesting way. It also gives Vehicles and controlling territory rather territories a bigger role.  But will anyone play it? Well it could be really good for Cobalt Ops type events if every can get together and more or less get a continent that isn't 1/2 randoms.  If the queue system is good (which i doubt) it could also be fun on Friday Nights, if enough people get into it.  But it needs to work so that zerging is flat out bad. If you put more than a platoon on a base for any length of time you should bleed points from ghost caps you can't respond to. While a lot of outfits will hopefully like a bigger challenge it's going to require co-operation and a high level.  Tl;Dr - The rules and game mode look kinda interesting. It's hard to argue that this is a bad ruleset, it's complicated enough that it's actually a challenge, rewards teamwork on small and large scale and allows for more of a competitive atmosphere. But I think they aimed too high with the number involved. It should have a been look for 2/3 platoons at most either in a 2 or 3 way fight. Why not use a redesigned Esamir  or something a bit smaller."

Counter rant  People like you, and your infantile, infantry(heavy)-centric CoDKid perception of ""how the game should be played"" are the reason this game has been consistently dumbed down since launch and ergo the reason there is no outfit vs outfit metagame, all the fights are lattice zerg clusterfucks of redeployside, and infantry/vehicle interaction is as loltastic as it is.  The ""war on downtime""/HA-beats-all/zero interdependence design paradigm is the fundamental reason this game is a joke on a strategic/large group scale, and your bushido rules of ""infantry 1v1"" are the absolute cornerstone of this mindset.  People like you, with your:   knowing you are an infantry player ten times better than them, and that you could hit them so hard in an infantry 1v1 that they would rage scream behind their computer   are the majority, sadly, and ergo where the money lies. SOE/DBG, chasing that dollar, have diluted and butchered the game that PS2 could have been, in an effort to cater to self entitled ""console FPS"" generation players, who expect to be able to succeed in any situation, against any opponent, from the comfort of their HA. Anything that kills their HA without a decent chance of reprisal/mutual death is clearly cheese/op/no skill.  You wrote a massive textwall about things people do to kill the game. What is very sad, and telling, to me, is that you didn't mention: only playing in overpop/passively following a zerg, and, only defending, or defending the vast majority of the time  These 2 habits are far worse for the state of live than anything to do with class/loadout choice in a given fight.  You write a massive textwall about problems with the player culture, and you completely fail to even acknowledge passively zerging and defence farming as factors.   This, coupled with your complaints about LMG nerfs, heavily implies to me that you are a career HA who is used to playing in a group/favourable circumstances, and have a strong dislike for any of the options in the game that are particularly effective against an HA.   Zerging Passive defence farm    This is the reason low ranks quit within the first hour of playing, this is the reason communities on this game die, this is the reason this game is not as popular as it should be."
PS2Cobalt,37qa2p,pintle,-2,Fri May 29 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"You are definitely correct in saying that zerging and passive defence farm are contributing factors. I wrote about zerging in the post, ""Also zerging is quite a problem but that will never die off, so there is no point trying to persuade anyone to stop that"".  I play a variety of infantry classes, mostly heavy though so you are correct in saying that. However, that does not instantly make me a ""call of duty kid"". The reason I play heavy is because it offers unique weapons, not high shielding. LMGs are very effective at most ranges (for me at least) compared to other weapons bar some Assault Rifles.  ESFs killing people around Sunderers will not only annoy a lot of players, but will also destroy the fight when the sundy gets destroyed. Farming/vehicles/ESF is okay if you want to make a gap in the enemies defences or do something tactical in a fight, but it is not okay to attempt to get a 50 KD or whatever. I know a couple of people who actually have no deaths on their killboard because they have been using the Banshee to farm. To make something clear, I am not stating that every non-infantry thing in the game should be permanently removed, because those things make the game unique. I am saying that they need to be used in the correct way or not at all, because a lot of people just use them for KD now days. Anyone can simply pull out an ESF/Tank and relentlessly take out an entire army of the opposition if they are careful.  TL;DR: It is okay when used tactically, it is bad when used for KD."
PS2Cobalt,37qa2p,GroundTrooper,2,Fri May 29 17:24:23 2015 UTC,I know a couple of people who actually have no deaths on their killboard because they have been using the Banshee to farm.   Given how the Banshee actually performs I find that highly unlikely.

Those things are in the game and are available to anyone and are used by randoms and outfits to be victorious. You can NOT ask them to don't use them. You will NOT change their minds. Only thing that can make people stop spamming MAXes etc. is some game tweaking by DBG (or a good proper resource system).    I don't care about shotguns / snipers (I really dont care at all about snipers).  I don't care too much about AI vehicle weapons. Only newbies get farmed really hard by them. There are good counters to many of them. Still, some bases need a rework to not be abused by farmers (I'm watching you Indar).  LMGs were needing a rework. Some of them are just way too powerful when compared to some others.  Zerging is a problem that has to be fixed with some semi-lattice thing or a new proper resource system. And more, better inter outfit coordination.  Most low BRs who leave the game are whether people changing game once every month or people who play alone. I don't know how to keep those guys playing."

And before you start, KD does not fully determine skill but does give you a good impression of how good they are.  You do not understand these things because you are a farmer yourself, evident by your killboard, and automatically brainwashed into thinking that it is right to kill with lolpods as you always do. However, what you fail to realise is that it takes no where near as much skill to farm as it does to become an achieved infantry player, and then to have that almost taken away from you by farmers (who are no way near as skilled 99.9% of the time) is angering.

I do not believe you have the understanding or skill to adequately assess how easy, or not, it is to lolpod farm.   Based purely on the number of incidences across all live servers, it is pretty fucking safe to assume that farming bads with an LMG/medkits is quite a lot easier than flying ESF.    You also cannot respawn without being farmed again and again and again, lock on rocket or not.   Can I clarify: You are stating that the only possible response to getting lolpodded, is to spawn at the same base (good to see you confirming my earlier assertion that you are a defence farmer) and point your g2a at them?

Each base out from the warpgate would add x number of nanites to the flow, but at a rate that means a faction pushing 96+ guys, spamming vehicles and MAXes, down a lane will run out of nanites fairly quickly.

There may be many things ""unfair"" or rewarding while not being risky in planetside, but the only thing that can change the gamestyle of the mainstream are direct changes to the game by the devs itself.  Until that change occurs (lol) find a way around the lolpodders and MAX-shitters, or enjoy getting your tears collected."

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,PastalavistaBaybie,5,Thu May 28 07:53:40 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn´t Heavies have SMGs, shotguns, .75? What sets them apart from other classes? Simply the shield. Of course it makes HA better at their AI role, because that´s exactly what this class and loadout is supposed to do. Other classes have other abilities and a LA coming out of nowhere to shotgun you in the face is by no means easier to counter than a shotgun HA.  Heavies have access to rocket launchers. Why is nobody bothered by the fact that the arguably strongest anti infantry class is also arguably the best AV class? (ignoring Maxes of course) The real problem is that Heavies can do everything alone. They are the best AI (which is good), they are the best AV and they don´t need Medics, thanks to Nanites. There is rarely a good reason not to pull HA, not because it´s too strong, but because it´s too versatile."

It's the thing you build (most) squads around. That's it's role as much as any other. It's not a problem that there's a class that has this role because a good squad still wants the other classes to make them stronger."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,BlckJck103,3,Thu May 28 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"I was obviously not referring to certain ability types or weapons (most of the can be substituted for by the Heavies other abilities), but for the multitude of situations that the Heavy is best suited for. HA is the only class that can carry effective weaponry against any threat in the game at the same time.  In particular, yes HA is the frontline infantry unit, so it´s obvious that it has an edge over the other classes in head on engagements. But it shouldn´t at the same time be effective against vehicles; that´s the Engineers role. That is obviously a matter of opinion, but following the simple rock-paper-scissors ideology, no class should be effective against everything at the same time."

That's why any TR Heavy that can afford it, is using the NS-15M. A lot of NC are using it too. Even some VS are using it, but probably just to Auraxium it."

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,SOLAR15,0,Thu May 28 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"I don't argue that NC is overall the best Faction and has the best of everything atm. It's just that 0.75x ADS weapons -especially on Heavies- are broken. You can hit your enemy and avoid his bullets at the same time.   Cyclone is better than the Orion in most situations. Anchor is amazing too. Scatmaxes, Ravens and IwinShield has been broken for 2+ years. Higby really fucked up the Interfactional balance with his NC bias. Now that he's gone, I would expect the current Dev Team to start balancing NC with VS and TR, buff TR to some extent and try to achieve some realistic balance. But that probably won't happen before the Playstation 4 version is ready to launch. They have too much work on their hands atm. We can just wait and hope for the best."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,syliner,2,Thu May 28 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"good morning nc/tr friends, now that I have your attention....  anyways, lmg changes did they announce anything I missed? what changes do you think should or will be made that don't include orion/betelgeuse?"
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Selerox,5,Thu May 28 06:38:43 2015 UTC,"Remove 0.75 from VS LMGs, is fine by me.   Then we get moving CoF buff (0.35), recoil buff (horizontal: 0.2/0.2125 for Orion and 0.2/0.2 for SVA, and vertical for SVA to 0.4) AND crucially a massive tolerance buff, lets have Anchor and MSW tolerance on Orion and SVA (0.45 sounds good). Obviously same for Betelgeuse. Also Orion and SVA Reloads nerfs can be reverted and SVA recovery can be reverted to its old value. Buff Flare recoil (0.175/0.175) and tolerance so it can actually use other attachments without being gimped in range vs similar LMGs. It is currently mechanically weaker for no good reason at all other than some dev probably fucked up and forgot to change its recoil when they changed its damage class in beta. Remember the old 167 Bloom on the GD-7F, well this is way worse. Buff Ursa recoil, tolerance and moving CoF (back to 0.35) or RoF to 600 rpm. Similarly gimped for no good reason. Pulsar LSW 0.35 moving CoF, much better tolerance + SPA. Polaris, remove Adv laser, replace with adv grip.   That's what removing 0.75 should mean.   There are similar small tweaks for TRs T32 or T16, depending on which gets which role.  NC LMGs have no changes.  0.75 is already heavily off-set, removing it properly will mean undoing all those nerfs the guns have sustained to keep it."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,syliner,5,Thu May 28 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"I think DBG should remove every 0.75 ADS movement speed from LMG's (except for the NS-15M). Also I would like to see MSW-R, T9 Carv, EM6, Anchor and Orion having lower damage at longer ranges, similar to the close range assault rifles and carbines. So 112 dmg at 65 meters for TR and VS and 125 dmg at 65 meters for NC. Then other LMG's like the T-32 Bull or EM1 would have their spot because they simply do more damage at longer ranges.  I personally dont mind the betelgeuse and its head mechanic. 450 Bullets in the Godsaw and the Butcher is usually more than you will ever need."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Selerox,4,Thu May 28 08:06:10 2015 UTC,"So what do you do to compensate VS for massively nerfing them?  Because it had better be fucking amazing.  I can fully understand the argument for giving a 0.75 ADS to TR and NC, but only if VS gets the corresponding 0.75 buffs to more ARs and Carbines."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Punisher_Ps2,3,Thu May 28 08:33:13 2015 UTC,VS Assault rifles are good. HV-45 and Terminus are excellent. Its just ... a lot of VS players play HA exculsivley. They cant know that their AR are very good.   Concerning carbines i have to agree that the Zenith is kinda meh compared to the Jaguar or Bandit.
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,syliner,2,Thu May 28 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there are a lot of VS weapons that are almost good, but just fall short. The Zenith is a prime example. It's a good weapon, but it's not good enough to use over the other options.  The same goes for the Corvus, Polaris, Pulsar and any number of other VS weapons. They're a tiny tweak or two from being great, but right now there's no reason to use them."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,BlckJck103,2,Thu May 28 11:05:11 2015 UTC,"TR AR's are like VS LMG's  VS AR's might be good, but TR's are still top of the foodchain."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Aggregationn,0,Thu May 28 08:42:53 2015 UTC,"True that. TR has definitely the best AR and NC the second best AR overall. The problem is that VS has its strong part within the strongest class and alot more people playing it in comparison to the other two factions. TR might have an edge in the AR category, still the medic has no overshield.   Just balance the VS AR by giving weapons like the cme and corvus a buff and buff some of the ""meh"" vs lmg like the polaris, lsw and flare (in line with the em6 or gauss saw s). And reduce the zentih recoil and give it spa."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,testsample,-3,Thu May 28 08:54:48 2015 UTC,TAR and HV-45 are basically the same. Terminus is better than the T1 Cycler. explain how TR AR are better than the VS ones. IMO the Carnage is on the very top of the AR foodchain.
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Punisher_Ps2,4,Thu May 28 08:49:58 2015 UTC,"TAR and HV-45 are basically the same.   That 10 rounds makes a huge difference. Both competitively and for live play. I mean for other things you're talk about a slightly better recoil patter on the T1 cycler. But in terms of ammo you've got a 33% increase over VS AR's.  Like Shurri says below, we had a much bigger problem with TARBalls from RO than when they or any one else used terminus/hv45, and on those few occasions we wanted Medics in a scrim we always preferred TAR > H-V45 or zenith.  Not saying those aren't good, but it's like MSW - Orion - Anchor, it's not like there's night and day between those LMGs in terms of performance.   I'm not opposed to losing .75 or giving NC/TR something for one of their LMG's. But i don't think you can do it without providing some compensation to a couple of VS LMGs."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,testsample,3,Thu May 28 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"this wont be the explanation you want, but after what feels like 500 scrims against RO, I played against TR AR's SO much that I feel like I can judge the strength (TAR, T1 cycler, TRV...very high ROF, accurate, magsize) of them quite well. annoying to play against, even as orion HA trust me.  edit: also choon mentioning about 1337 times how amazing his farm is with them compared to VS AR :p<.<"
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Punisher_Ps2,-1,Thu May 28 09:03:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly dont think the minimum damage of those LMG's is that much of an issue. If your firing an orion, mswr or anchor at 65 meters in the first place you are doing it wrong. And the em6 and carv are supposed to be less mobile but more accurate and ranged versions of their close range counterparts, so nerfing their ranged damage makes no sense."
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,syliner,1 point,Thu May 28 08:21:22 2015 UTC,"give NC and TR 0.75 ADS movement speed LMG, just so they can finally stop complaining about VS spamming Orion and Battlejuice.

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Punisher_Ps2,0,Thu May 28 06:58:28 2015 UTC,"I would apparently remove the 0.75 movement speed from lmgs at all (ns15m exception), but lets see."

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,BlckJck103,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"I never get the, ""Uhh, too many people play HA"" argument.  HA is obviously the frontline infantry class. It should be the main class played. Medics and Engineers are true support classes, (this includes medic balls, you rely on the support of revives). Light Assaults and Infiltrators are more specialists, there's no point of using a LA over Engi unless you take in JumpJets, no point in using Infi at close range over SMG heavy unless you use your cloak.  Those other classes are good but are either support or rely on situations, a light assault fighting in an enclosed base where it can't jump is just an Engi that can't use turrets or ammo.  In the end for 90% of fights you want the majority of your squad as Heavies, the exceptions being bases where LA are strong, if you really want to medic ball or if you have a specialist job; hacking/sniping/harrassing etc"
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Aloysyus,0,Thu May 28 09:33:55 2015 UTC,"You are right here.

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,BlckJck103,2,Thu May 28 10:25:05 2015 UTC,"the difficulty is balancing a 1v1 advantage with a 4v1 advantage.  The orion is really good, but i still prefer the Betelgeuse and Bull, one has infinite ammo = better farm, the other has a 60 Round mag with fast reload = better farm.  I don't think there's a right answer, but live isn't all about 1v1 fights. Sometimes a Butcher or CARV-S w/Ext Mags is what you want to just mow down the farm as it runs through a door etc.  I think you can nerf the Orion, but it needs to be done along with a lot of other LMGs, or all you get is the wheel turning rather than good balance."

PS2Cobalt,37kas2,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Thu May 28 09:31:18 2015 UTC,OP than they currently are.   In which way pls? The orion would be more like the msw-r and the sva more like a zenith with more attachments and range and without 0.75 ads.   Overall I never have problems with msw-r users neither zenith ones. The only thing that is OP to me is 0.75 ads movement speed on the best IvI class and giving it the msw-r dps (orion) or a big mag coupled with no recoil (sva).  Overall I don´t really have that much of a problem with those weapons overall. I just pull out my own heavy and just kill them with better skill. But they still need some serious tweaking.
PS2Cobalt,37kas2,Panserskolt,1 point,Thu May 28 09:44:39 2015 UTC,I'd trade .75 for less recoil on Orion any day.

Intel CPU's can get much warmer than AMD ones and the i* -4*** series gen cpu's are much more energy efficient than the AMD one you wrote down above.  The SSD isn't nescessary.

PS2Cobalt,37ijrz,RetOld,2,Thu May 28 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"Worth? Not as much as the company is asking you for it. They've used a couple of components with impressive sounding numbers to hide the fact they're selling you an absolute dog.  Take off capslock, look at who actually makes the stuff they're NOT shouting about (PSU, Mother Board, HDD etc)  That GPU is woeful. Accept nothing less than a GTX760/R270. The CPU is ok, but I'd personally pick out an i5. The CPU cooler is hilarious overkill unless your Mother Board supports overclocking that CPU.   The PSU is similarly over the top (because cheap big number PSU can be had for relatively little money and sound impressive) and also likely to be made of a birds nest infused with headphone grade wiring, just primed and ready to burn out in spectacular style, sending a 1KW surge through your hardware and kill your PC inside a year.  The weird thing is the HDD. 330GB? 2005 called and want their storage solution back.  TL: DR - Run away. This has all the alarm bells and flags of a nuclear testing range. Build your own and learn a new skill. It will save you so much heartache and money in the long run."
PS2Cobalt,37ijrz,Phreekedelic,2,Thu May 28 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"Drop the 100W PSU, drop the water cooling.  I7+NH-D15, 970GTX, 650PSU all hooked up to a decent upper mid range MOBO with 16GB of ram, decent SSD to run windows and TB sized HDD to run everything else, 16GB of ram and shitload of fans in a well rated and ventilated ATX tower.   You can thank me now. Basically never go full retard. Buy upper mid range parts, spend good money on stuff that's hard to replance and that provides the biggest performance alterations and that you are not planning on replacing in near future. Basically MOBO, processor and cooling for it take priority, fallowed by a decent GPU within your budget and then everything else.  As example of not going retard. 980 GTX in my part of the world is now close to 700€ and provides around 15-20% performance increase over 970 GTX. But 970 is around 400€ in price. Going retard would be buying the 980 because it's the best card within my price range even though it only provides 1/5 performance increase.  So if you're not planning on overclocking the shit out of your system a 650W PSU is more than sufficient. If you're not overclocking the shit out of your system then fans will be just fine at keeping the rig breathing and cool. Since you're asking on what to buy and providing stupid builds i'll doubt you'll be overclocking so everything i've said is the most sensible thing you'll hear in this thread."

PS2Cobalt,37ijrz,Ualat1,1 point,Wed May 27 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"Well like any PC it's more or less work in progress. If you buy everything of the shelf you're going to be over budget. If you can cannibalize your previous rig for non essentials and stuff that still did you good then you can save some good money.   I did a fast build with upper mid range parts couldn't go below 1500€ range. The initial investment in CPU and GPU is massive. With both being above 400€ range easily bringing the price up to around 900€ with those two alone. But then again i didn't really look into what's the best cheapish I5/I7 at the market right now and went for a known reliable 4790K. If you cannibalize your previous rig for SSD, HDD, ATX Tower, ram and the like you could probably just settle within 1K   Best thing is to check part review sites for benchmarks and reviews and choose best performers in certain price range.  I'm running a I7 3770 @ 3.4ghz with NH-D14 cooler of some MSI wicked durable MOBO series. 16GBRAM/250SSD/2TBHDD, 650W PSU in a Coolmaster Silencio ATX tower.

For example a 650W PSU will be enough for non overclocked system with a single high end GPU card. I have no idea if sticking another card in would require upgrade to the power supply box. I'd read up on it though beforing going through with such upgrades.  But without reading up i know i'd have to modify my ventilation somewhat since another GPU will take up a good portion of space which will effect the flow of air inside the tower and obviously double the heat generation by vidiya cards."

PS2Cobalt,37ijrz,Phreekedelic,1 point,Thu May 28 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"Warning: Amateur PC build advice incoming. Other people will definitely know more / better than me, but I think I can start you off with some recs / pointers.  PS2 is generally regarded as getting along better with Intel CPUs, so if you can get a decent i5 that might be a better choice.  I'd also say your PSU looks to be overkill for the system you're building- you shouldn't need 1000w, but do go with something from a known brand that will accommodate e.g. any GPU upgrades you might want to make in a year or so's time. PC site configurators will often tell you if the PSU you're using is too low wattage for the system.  More RAM is a cheap-ish and easy upgrade to make later on, so starting with 8GB wouldn't be a bad idea.  AIO water coolers are alright, but if you spend a bit less on an air cooler than on the H100i, something midrange from Noctua, you'll have decent cooling performance for most overclocks and quieter cooling at that. If not overclocking, do not spend that much on the CPU cooler.  Installing PS2 on an SSD does help with load times. I use a 120 GB SSD as my boot drive plus PS2, and then a 1TB hard drive as bulk storage, which I find to be a nice compromise in terms of speed vs capacity. Also a GTX 960 will serve you much better than the 750 Ti, and is still in the range of decent value for money.  I'm on an i5 4690 with 8GB of RAM and an R9 270X. With the recent multithreading optimisations I go down to about 40 FPS in 96+ fights, running graphics settings on High. Rest of the time I hover at 59-60FPS."

PS2Cobalt,37cbup,Oliver_Closeov,2,Wed May 27 10:50:22 2015 UTC,"It's all about averages and application.  I hate MAX spam in small fights - the kind that I actually enjoy the hell out of until one or two just skew the battle.  I refuse to pull maxes in small battles or indeed outside of alerts or really serious play.  However, I DO pull them in alerts or when the SL/PL calls for them.  I'm sure there are a few people around who can vouch for me lone-wolfing in a 1-12 biolab fight against two VS maxes using only knife and commissioner :-)  There's another lesson in there.  Sometimes ""fun"" can just be saying ""fuck it, to hell with KD"" and persisting at something really daft to make the enemy go ""WTF is this guy on""."

Maybe a good one would fix the MAX spam problem, but I'm not an idiot. We won't see a good one until (lots of) months. So IMO there must be a limitation on the pull/facility/time or pull/time.

PS2Cobalt,37e7eh,Daikar,4,Wed May 27 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"The point is, your skill is going down when you fly together 24/7 (Disco is the best example or maybe you aswell). Well if that is no problem for you than ok, but your flying on live doesn´t work, because you will not face an enemy who is organized aswell.   If you want to call your squad stuff organized at all. You simply can´t practise serversmash stuff on live, cause there is nothing organized against you. The only thing you do with that is to break the fun for the people who play alone, nothing more.  You can tell me that you will maybe improve your comms or they should join an outfit blabla, but that isn´t really something that needs to be learned. Just simply jump the guy who is jumping your mate and so on in a group fight. Simple as that.   The stuff you want to learn is get better with aiming, awareness and try to improve in fights where you are outnumbered.   Enough from that. Now to the thing with the airsquad. The ""gank squad"" was up cause of disco pulling one first. Simple as that. And yeah you simply won all the fights.  As far as I remember you lost more than you won and the only fight you won was when you jumped us while we were fighting nc at the nc territory. We had probably equal numbers, but you had 5/6 esf with one of those had coyotes. We had 3/4 mossies without coyotes and one lib.   You can call this equal, but imo you had the advantage cause an esf is simply better in group fights, than a solo lib.  To your video, imo this isn´t stuff which is worth to make a video out off it. It just shows how you are 3/2v1ing esfs and killing libs while they are fighting others+one tryhard bail.

They pulled atleast a platoon one Reavers and we died pretty fast at the WG but fought them for about 1-2 hours until the air was almost empty and then we went a2g for 30min or so and helped taking out sundies and tanks across the map.

Just a comparison from now and from before.    Of course you can practice it on live, just need someone to organize TR. I will keep breaking the fun for the solo pilots until they stop flying solo.   You will not get the solo pilots to fly together, cause thats fucking boring and nice to hear that you like to break the fun of people, who enjoy playing an other playstyle. One last time. You will not get an organized enemy on live and it will not happen any time soon.   The only thing that will happen is that you guys will get less skilled while flying together all the time, cause you can always rely on your buddy and you don´t need to be good+scythe. Guess if you reach this point you will go full coyote. Well for me that isn´t fun and I think for you it isn´t aswell. Atlleast for the guy who came to this server right after the merge.   Doesn't it matter why you pulled one? You claim you never gank and yet you do.   Pulling one to not getting gank is quite legit imo. If there is no gank squad than we don´t pull one aswell.   I thought it was a 3v1?   That´s what the video shows and what he did in it. It was still not equal and you guys still lost alot more fights than won.   The mossie is hard to hit from the front, I'd argue the mossie and reavers is much better in teamfights. Jumping a scythe is the easiest thing you can do.    The mossy is quite easy to hit from the front, if you can aim well. It is hard to hit while it is dodging sideways, but not when they are facing eachother in a straight position. Still the scythe is the best in a face to face fight and it doesn´t matter if it is easy to jump, when you are 3v1 ing somebody. The reaver is best in group fights, than the mossi, but only if the scythe is getting oneclipped, before it is able to turn.    Jumping a scythe is the easiest thing you can do.    A reaver is a easier to hit, cause you don´t have a gap a the botton and on top and it is still easy to hit when it is facing you, same applies to the mossi and not for the scythe. Plus the scythe is best with coyotes/locks vs. nosegun and it has the best nosegun available.   It did spark some drama, and oh boy if bling is good at anything it's drama.   Well I guess if somebody is posting provoking stuff, than it´s kinda obvious. But I forgot at what is VIPR good? Pulling shit on live and on reddit and trying to defend it probably?

Just think about the people who were flying in that airforce pre merge and now think how did they become so effective? In 5v1ing people on live or playing/flying solo most of the time? Isn´t it like that the blng squad was always the best air squad in the serversmash? And we were/are normally flying solo, unless there is something you can´t get done alone.   Alot of guys left, due to SOE/DBG pulling shit in patches not because of you, but there is something about the airgame that has changed. It is nowadays alot more ganky and skilless than it was one year ago and I think that is due to some people and the merge.  Nowadays you cannot even fly a lib with your gunner, without getting ganked all day long or having a good old 1v1 fight. For me the airgame is getting more and more boring and if this will continue I will quit air, because I am sick of it. And I think I won´t be the only one who will do that."

PS2Cobalt,37e7eh,NerfDragonhawks,0,Wed May 27 15:22:39 2015 UTC,"no i didnt start trash talking, if you considered my comment on youtube trashtalking then you should grow up and accept an 'opinion' (i didnt say that you and botteled are crap i said in IMO they arent the best but i definitely knew that you both were top).   I also didnt know blng very well cause i was still new to the whole elite players etc etc. Then on live i got daltoned by bottled and rage tells form him was swiming on my chat screen all because of my opinion on youtube.   I looked up to both of u and admired the skill i saw with bottled's aim. But now i know that some guys in blng don't like opinions and will throw a fit if that opinion is against them.  in conclusion, if u understood the word 'opinion' and didn't throw rage tells at me, all of this B.S wouldn't have happened."
PS2Cobalt,37e7eh,jbkappirossi,1 point,Wed May 27 15:45:14 2015 UTC,I dont get it why you have to talk crap again now? This trashtalking came from your side and brutal only defended himself and the others by saying something that was apparently true. I don´t see your problem anyways.

PS2Cobalt,374s1z,Spartancfos,2,Mon May 25 03:39:12 2015 UTC,"""Small Bases are worth 2%""  And this TR, is why you can't have nice things."
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,BlckJck103,2,Mon May 25 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"2% Value, because you go down one and they go up one. It baffles me that the Alert calculator is not weighted in favour of large bases, or based on ownership throughout the Alert, or takes into account cut off bases."
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,Spartancfos,5,Mon May 25 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"The point was, small bases aren't worth 2%, each base is worth the same. It's something that a lot of people believe, but if you're trying to win an alert, it helps to actually know the mechanics :P  Roughly % per base should be:   Esamir: 1.69% (This is why I love Esamir, last minute win with with 26% pop anyone?) Amerish: 1.23% Indar: 1.07% Hossin: 1.14%   This is then complicated further by the fact the final percentage has to be rounded into whole numbers. It's pissed me off before when on an Indar alert, TR led on north WG by 2%. I left it till 5min, dropped ceres hydro (i think). We take the base; ""No way we lose now"". TR go down to 34, VS stays on 33. ""WHAT!!! FU SOE!!!!""  It's like long ago when people used to argue the number of hexes decided how much a base was worth. Making some bases worth 10x more than others :D That's if i haven't got it completely wrong myself for 2 years o.0"
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,BlckJck103,1 point,Mon May 25 10:09:43 2015 UTC,"I was defending him, because I think he was referring to when you are fighting against the leader in an Alert its 2%, you go up by one, they go down by one - de facto 2%.  Honestly I would like to see a weighting actually based on the number of Hex's in a base, and the base capture mechanics adjusted to match the value of bigger bases. Including things like LLU caps, and other interesting base mechanics. I am tired of king of the hill guard the room. The amount of time spent defending a stair case in this game.  That rounding thing has never actually affected me - but then TR don't win alerts. Kinda BS though."
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,Spartancfos,2,Mon May 25 11:05:53 2015 UTC,"Tbh they should just bring in some facility alerts again, or at least seomthing that isn't completely territory based. Old facility alerts trained PLs much better, taught you about securing bases, back capping and slowing down pushes, watching multiple maps rather than just one. Facility alerts felt more like a boxing match. You spent the game always 10, 20 minutes ahead. Territory alerts are just a brawl, you never look more than 7minutes ahead and spend most of your time redeploying and rushing."
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,ellnic,1 point,Mon May 25 11:16:00 2015 UTC,"I miss the facility alerts. The multi continent game was so interesting to keep tabs on. With current redeployside meta admittedly taking a Biolab is a shitty fight(if its not sneaky flipped), but at least the Tech Plant and Amp station ones would be good fun."
PS2Cobalt,374s1z,Landeman,2,Mon May 25 11:29:03 2015 UTC,Facility alerts without lattice... mhhhmmm... those were the days... But then i remember biolab madness and those memories are not so pleasant anymore :D This game misbehaves in 96+ fights and those were very often results of facility alerts.

I think strikers in Valkyries would be interesting to test. Imagine 3-4 valkyries with 2 Heavy strikers on a side. Don't know it it's very efficient but would be awesome nonetheless :p  There are so many awesome things we can do in this game actually, maybe not allways as effective but it can be pretty epic.

The outfits here on reddit that care about the game and anything in it have the strict policy to punish any abusers.   premerge cobalt was the best server i could imagine   Indeed, that doesn't mean it got worse because by saying that you are insulting another ex-server.   infantry on Cobalt is pretty damn bad   Maybe and it's because of the new playerbase and also because most of the vets have left, if they were still around you would've had a different opinion.

Those damn hitches know to be very annoying , sometimes I get like 3-10 every minute , sometimes more ...

Personally i started to record a lot less, delete some stuff after i quit playing for the day - and even after i imported the videos and start editing i delete quite some scenes.  Always try to have that 3rd person view on the vid: There's quite some stuff where i can imagine how much fun you had, i hear all the laughter. But for other people it's not that funny or entertaining. The video you linked has a lot of Lib repair and all that. Vievers will become impatient and start to scroll or close the video.  No one thinks you must be 100% MLG to make videos, but go for the good stuff. Collect the diamonds, put them in a video, do something original with them... The better or original you become the more good footage you will collect. And if you really want to release a video and you don't have footage for 5 min yet - make it 3 min."

Seriously, if there was exploit that would grant you things from depot for free they would freaking shutdown servers and revert it to the state before the patch. But sorry, this bug only affects players and those guys are not our concern.  I'm not saying that bugs should not exist but there should be like a freaking exposure levels assign for things. And exploits should not be low priority.   We are doing witchhunt and throwing players against players(the AA lockons are the biggest community divider) and i think not everyone remember that there is someone who is main evildoer here"

PS2Cobalt,36sqe8,RachitynowyJoe,0,Fri May 22 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, probably. I am not defending them, they can do it themselves if they want.  I am rather accusing DBG of ignoring major problems here. And that playerbase is getting too far from core problems.  What this game needs in exploit area are 2 things:   Priority based elimination of exploits. Those that affect core mechanics should get higher rating and those that are really harmless(like boosting accuracy in VR) lower. Quick and definite punishment system for any violation of rules   Without first, second is faulty. Without both we have crash of the system.  I can imagine mentality that have simple way of thoughts: ""Ok, i am not using any additional software so i am not a cheater, nobody is banned or punished for it so why i should hold myself up, others do it as well"". And what we can counter that way with, to be completely honest? SOE/DBG vaguely say anything about exploiting. You cannot be certain what is exploit and what is not. Community defines it so far and thus it is not legitimate source.   I can easily form list of most common exploits used and approved till today:   Climbing due to jump spam(according to logic and other games it should be exploit) Beacon rotation( magical transferring something to inventory? i would call it exploit) changing vehicle ownership (there are numerous benefits from owning the vehicle and you can give somone loadouts he does not posses, exploit?)   Are those exploits? Some may say yes, most will say no. Those are community approved though. But mostly those are bugs in code that played out nicely.  What i would like to say after that wall of text that it is not community role to judge nor resolve. It is DBG work. And they should post statement about it. And put effort into it.  Now in the game, if i would start it and find out that grenades are going through shield i would do it. Why not? It is in the game after all. There is no dev notice about it. No announcement. If they would ban me for it i would be pissed because why? I've done everything according to game mechanics.  I personally know better because i attend reddit and i know this game for long. But i can't really say what signal DBG is giving me here with ignoring those exploits. Are spawn rooms shields penetrable now? No?"
PS2Cobalt,36sqe8,BlckJck103,3,Fri May 22 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"Climbing due to jump spam(according to logic and other games it should be exploit)   Techinally an exploit it's usually just occasional annoyance. Wall jumping doesn't very often break the game. The worst outcome is that Heavy and sometimes a MAX might get where only a LA can. But once there they obey the same game rules, they can't shoot into a spawn room, the don't get more health etc. Similar to boosting in CS or the parkour of ET these are just tricks learned by players. The fact that LA's are in the game mean mos people should be aware of people in these positions, and the infrequency of people doing stuff like getting MAXes onto roofs of the biolab means this is generally a bug that should be allowed to remain.   Beacon rotation( magical transferring something to inventory? i would call it exploit)   This was mentioned else. It probably was an exploit. But it actually made the game better, squads were able to do more. The game was improved by it, and beacons themselves were nerfed to balance the fact you could have so many.   changing vehicle ownership (there are numerous benefits from owning the vehicle and you can give somone loadouts he does not posses, exploit?)   This isn't an exploit, it's an intended game mechanic, if you don't own a vehicle anyone can take it.   What i would like to say after that wall of text that it is not community role to judge nor resolve. It is DBG work.   Completely disagree, the community itself must drive stuff like this. PRST exploit bugs constantly, and there is no argument of moral equilivancy between exploiting the ""Beacon Rotation"" to keep your guys in a fight, and hiding in walls / throwing nades through spawn rooms / Cert Farming from friendly fire. 90% of outfits would kick their members. PRST leadership is frankly, dumb, and think they have a right to use these exploits.  This stuff should be rammed at DBG until they are forced to take action, otherwise, with so much to do why else would they care?"
PS2Cobalt,36sqe8,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Fri May 22 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"I am not saying those exploits are bad, i'm using them and beacon rotation is important piece that seperate good teamplayers from pubbies. But from new player viewpoint it is not so easy to find difference between what is intended mechanism and what is not.  Exactly, those things should be rammed at DBG and this is my point. They don't care about servers subreddits and such. This whole thread gone 94 anwers so far and none of them will reach SOE. Waste of energy if it will not change anything. And i would rather target DBG to eliminate those bugs because if there is no exploit there will be no exploiters. Especially if bug have such long history like this one"
PS2Cobalt,36sqe8,BlckJck103,2,Fri May 22 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"But from new player viewpoint it is not so easy to find difference between what is intended mechanism and what is not.   Yes, I have no problem with someone abusing a bug, and not realising what they've done. Yes DBG should do more to clear this up.  But that isn't what this is about.  PRST abuse bugs consistently and despite multiple people telling them on reddit and in-game that what they are doing is exploiting and game breaking, they do it anyway. It is part of the community to police itself, we've done it in the past and if DBG won't respond to their blatent disregard for the rules then I'll have no problem simply TK'ing anyone with a PRST tag until they do."

Only thing to do is to crack open some drinks and wait for the fixes/balance passes to roll in :P"
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,alexcafis,5,Tue May 19 16:02:09 2015 UTC,If you pass lead to somebody he doesn´t have a beacon slot. If he give´s it to you he has a beacon slot but cannot place it. You need to respawn or resupply to fix. GG squadplay is broken
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Omnishoot,-2,Tue May 19 16:17:31 2015 UTC,Thats how it was for a long time and how it should be. Just swapping the lead around is essentially exploiting. It's not forbidden because it's intentional by the devs but you shouldn't be able to just bypass the 5min cd the whole time. Resupplying/dying is a good criteria for when you should have a beacon. (Even though this whole thing may be a bug)
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Noname_FTW,4,Tue May 19 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"ITT: People pretend to be able to discern what is a ""bug"" and what is a ""feature"" in PS2 these days"
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,MyCreagle,2,Tue May 19 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"It's a feature but it's not a good one to be honest.   Swapping beacons provide an way to easy option to keep the fight going when you shouldn't be able to sustain it anymore. I'll rely and use beacon swaps as much as possible but i wont consider it a good feature from squad play perspective.   A working squad has good play from perspective of everyone playing his role right and good synergy between HA's & Medics, Engineers & Maxes and so fourth. The role of squad leader should be one that isn't easly shifted from one person to another based on imidiate benefits that the role provides. Rather the game should have more defined features that would make having a good squad leader a guy you don't want to shift around to much.  Note that in general my opinions are in complete disagreement with NoName regarding gameplay features but the man has a point."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,RetOld,1 point,Tue May 19 22:23:26 2015 UTC,Beacon swapping on live was practically impossible to stop. With EMPs now killing them though I don't think they can move away from this though. Even really good beacons get knocked out by one good infi.
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,BlckJck103,1 point,Tue May 19 18:30:26 2015 UTC,swapping the lead around is essentially exploiting. It's not forbidden because it's intentional by the devs   lolwat
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Sotanaki,2,Tue May 19 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"He explains to quite clearly.  The game has a mechanic to stop you putting multiple beacons down in a 5 minute window. However people found that if the SL gave lead away the new SL automatically gets a beacon without resupplying. Essentially giving you a beacon every 25 seconds. There's no point having a cooldown of 5minutes if this was intentional.  Old beacons were ridiculously OP letting squads keep getting back into a base with ease. They took 2 nerfs to balance them a bit because of that.  tl;dr : beacon swapping does seem like it was exploiting, The 5min CD and platoon lead not being able to ""give"" beacons doens't make sense otherwise but it was so widespread and actually a decent mechanic they left it in and nerfed beacons in other ways. At least that's how I see it."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,BlckJck103,1 point,Wed May 20 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing wether it's OP or not and it should be nerfed or not, I'm just amused by the fact that in the precedent post OP was saying both that it was exploit, and intentional by the devs, which doesn't make sense"

I just point out what I found not good and I am not salty or whatever you wanna call that. Imo gals by themselves are kinda too good and now they stack eachother while repairing. For me thats kinda op and you need only two guys for it.  I don´t have something against air squads or whatever, but this today was kinda too much, just like that retarded lock-on platoon we had after the april patch.   For me it´s just boring, nothing else and it takes out the fun from the game. Never understand people having fun with this bs. When I would have be with them I would have quit after 10 minutes."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Punisher_Ps2,3,Tue May 19 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"I get it, it's not fun when you face an enemy you have no chance of beating. We just wanted to have some fun with the new toys they gave us, why didn't TR get a air squad of their own?  I can't say the proxy repair is op or not because we didn't face any organized counter attack at all. But I dare say that if you guys pulled a 24 man air squad and focused fired a single gal at a time they would fall extremly fast.  You talk about skill and you are one of the best pilots on the server but how much better do you think you can actually get? I reached the point where I felt I wasn't improving anymore. That's not to say I'm the best because I know I'm not but the skill that almost every pilot on cobalt really lacks is flying in a squad. Most pilots are solo pilots that has managed to get by with just relying on their skill and gank noobs all day. Tell me how is it different when you jump a br10 and us jumping you with 12 pilots, both you and the br10 has no chance of winning. But when that br10 complains he gets told ""stay mad, stay bad"".   If you ask me you need 10 times more skill to fly now then what you did before, now you can't rely on just your skill alone but on others to help you make the impossible possible. Adapt or die because you will see more air squads on cobalt that's for sure.  EDIT: Wasn't BLNG created because you wanted the strongest air outfit in the game? But you soon realised it wasnt fun because there was nobody to challenge you? Well now you have a challenge, accept it and resurrect the name of you outfit and show us what you guys are really made off!"
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Daikar,1 point,Tue May 19 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah real challenge lol. It is the same way with overpopped bases, if the enemy has some much overpop, than you can´t win even if you are for example twice as good.   These days almost nobody is flying anymore from the outfit and I get max 4 guys and thats enough for 2 scythes and 2 of those balanced gals (not even sure).   PS: I never understand why you are now even flying with coyotes and with tons of guys around you lol.

It's the same thing with overpopped bases ( although its mostly a lot more numbers there) if you get zerged you need to call for reinforcement. I mean if someone sent 96 ppl to a base in the server smash where you had 12 guys you wouldn't complain they were zerging would you?   S: I never understand why you are now even flying with coyotes and with tons of guys around you lol.

I can understand your effort as air pl, but you still should do it, like you were doing it in the past.   You said you liked organizing stuff?    Yeah I did say that and tbh it is still the same, BUT in a manner where you don´t have more people/zerging and it includes fun, like organized hornet strikes (for example two guys focusing one target with their hornets and cover each other from air).  Best example is when I was flying with paff against disco and mctoast last year. It was a hell lot of fun doing that and we covered each other well and it was fun. In comparison you are apparently airzerging with a bunch of force multipliers. No way I can see the fun in that.  Same thing is I like 12v12 scrims or the upcoming lanesmash thing, where I want to participate with BLHR and MACS together.   That is organized, fun and fair stuff, where skill still matters and you can´t just fly to your gal and say ""Ah I am shit but fuck yourself I have my sweet toy, which is repairing my buttfucked ass 24/7, even when I am in the big dissadvantage""."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Punisher_Ps2,1 point,Wed May 20 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to achieve is to make air squads a regular thing on live, where you always have at least 12 pilots in a squad per faction. If I can make that happen they can start practicing what I want them to practice and then just take those 36 pilots and put them into the air platoon for the smash.  Organised hornets strikes is a great example of fun, but I would bet the tank you are taking out feels ganked and think you are zerging. There's always gonna be someone who feels the fight wasn't fair.   And yes what we did yesterday was zerging on a whole new level but I promise it won't be a regular thing. As I said we only did it to have some fun with the new galaxies. It will die down a bit in the comming days and my goal is to have just one gal as a fallback for the air squad. But you can't really blame ppl for flocking to try out something new on patch day. And almost everything is OP when a huge amount of players use it and are coordinated."

PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Cornelisatorus,2,Tue May 19 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"We don't really like flying in big groups too much tbh (doesn't mean we can't do it as we consistently performed the best out of all airsquads in the smashes),  Also, cut the BS about challenge. Whenever we used to match your airgroups in the past (before the changes) and had anything approaching equal numbers (or less, I remember we wiped you with 3 Mossis against 5 Scythes repeatedly) you either all logged off or went on to 12+ guys with locks."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,NerfDragonhawks,3,Tue May 19 22:04:54 2015 UTC,"I have never lead a squad with lockons in it unless we are ground pounding with PPA etc, so stop lying. Yes some Viper members use them but whenever I lead a squad I always say no lockons otherwise Im not doing it."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Daikar,2,Wed May 20 04:04:36 2015 UTC,"Dude you're using coyotes yourself, cut the crap.   If you actually wanted competition you'd organize matches by coordinating with other outfits and not just gank people with locks and massive number advantanges. But you aren't, you airzerg on the faction which has the best aircraft against the least organized factions.   But what do expect from an air platoon lead who shows up to a match 5 minutes before it starts and asks which continent we play on and then proceeds to go more or less rogue during the match?:)"
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,NerfDragonhawks,1 point,Wed May 20 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yes I am and as I told punisher I'm using them for a reason. I'm creating a guide for outfits and pilots to follow on how to use the weapons available in the smash. To do that I need to use those weapons for a bit so I learn more about them.  The scythe is only strong in 1v1 and that's what 30% of what actual combat looks like on live.  The last part is justified and I accept that blame and will try to do better for the upcoming smashes. Hopefully I can earn your trust back, but I need your help. So please join for the meeting this Friday and bring as many pilots as you can for it."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,Daikar,1 point,Wed May 20 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, unexpectedly conciliatory, appreciated.  Scythe still has an extremely good nosgun and unless you get jumped from 3 different directions you should always be able to show your pancake to people, admittedly it probably takes quite a bit of practice and Reavers are overall still better for group fights.  As for the Smash, I doubt most of BLNG in one will play unless Bequ comes back to lead a squad in smashes (which I think is pretty unlikely). To be frank I doubt most of us will even keep playing, we tried again but this patch is just terrible and it looks like flight controls will stay bad (no, good enough doesn't do it for us at that point).   I still want Cobalt to do well though, it's still my home in PS2 and I don't wanna be from the server that loses to everyone but Connery. What you need to do is stop chosing the easy way. This applies to smashes as well as live play. Instead of saying 'I want a challenge' and then ganking on the faction which has the best air presence (yes the shitty Mossis with locks are annoying but you can easily cut through them with 2 or 3 decent Scythes) organize actual fights, don't just roam with 6+ people against no organized resistance. People are more likely to just log off at this point in the game. And tbh, for all that bull about it just improving squad cohesion or helping people to get into the airgame - when someone has 100+ hours in a Scythe he doesn't improve by flying in groups, what helps you improve as a pilot then is just flying alone or in small groups. All your airballs do is help people settle old scores. Again, look at how BLNG performed in the smashes compared to others - and we don't practice flying in groups of 12, it's just that our mechanics are on point, so to speak.   So, if you wanna do better, do duels, fly on your own, maybe arrange some fights against equal sized opponents, preferably on PTS because since the fucking merge we got so much ganking going on it's retarded. Or don't, just continue 5v1ing people and talk yourself up in TS, up to you."

I'm not the kind of guy who can't see when I'm wrong and if someone says something that is actually true I don't look through my fingers and stick to my opinion. I like to think I'm a person who uses logic and common sense for the most part. And even though we disagree on many things I don't think any less of you. These discussions are good because if everyone just agreed with me things would go crazy.    Scythe still has an extremely good nosgun and unless you get jumped from 3 different directions you should always be able to show your pancake to people, admittedly it probably takes quite a bit of practice and Reavers are overall still better for group fights.   Much agreed, and I would never day you are wrong about that. What I don't agree on though is ppl calling the scythe OP.

That's where I don't agree with you, it might be true for a lot of pilots but I feel that even if I put another 1000hours into only solo flying and duels I won't improve much. But I do feel that teamwork and communication is a field that for me feels a bit unexplored. I want to find out what happens when you put 12 good pilots together and have them fly with the same pilots for 1000hours as a team."

PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,xPaffDaddyx,1 point,Tue May 19 22:40:07 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand that i enjoy dying in PS2. I am in JEST the Patron Saint of Death.  I got death itself on speed dial and she's swooned by my conduct so much that the her panties drop the moment i cross the Sanzu River.  We pulled reavers because we kind of saw you shitting on other NC in the area. If you're happy fighting us then i can't really complain here. We exchanged deaths fairly equally in our encounters but i'm still rather baffled that you thought you could raw skill shit on us without any preperations. We're shit but when i'm leading we're vicious little shits that will exploit the situation  and weakness of others to give us biggest possible advantage.  Before meeting you we lost around 15 valkyries already between the two fronts so you're not that special mango. Rammed 3 ESF's with the valk and killed two liberators in 1v1's with the Helion.
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,RetOld,2,Wed May 20 12:35:27 2015 UTC,"Made me actually realize how little passion I have left for the game, a few months ago I would have been pissed at myself because in one of the fights it came down to just you and your wingman around 50-70percent health and I had just flared, I really shoulda killed you both before you locked again but couldn't hit shit. A while ago I would've kept pulling stuff or at least asked Paff or Kuni for 1v1s to get somewhat back into it but these days it's just... yeah whatever and boot up Metal Gear Rising or w/e."
PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,NerfDragonhawks,0,Tue May 19 22:46:57 2015 UTC,"You flew stale man.   When facing against odds and against hard counters you need to be far more mobile, agressive and reckless. Hoverfight turreting from a stable position is not the way to go when facing two tomcat Reavers.  I almost rammed you there but screwed up because.. Well because sometimes i can't tell if i'm playing with my hands or my feet.  My wingman had around 50 hours in ESF. I've got over 200 right now. I was less than at half health, i never use firesup and my tomcat loadout is rotary/A2AM's so your goal should have been to do damage to me first, then flare and keep fighting for 4 seconds further while counting down the effect in your head, then peel of to cover since there is around 4 seconds of time for you to do so after the flares wear off. Take cover after which jump at me again, either take me out or do considerable damage and AB at my wingman, damage him in CQC and peel of back behind cover and jump at the guy who is further from you while trying to use the one closer to you for cover to break locks.  Fighting tomcat users is one of the most fun shit in this game when you know what you're doing. I should probably make a video of ""the moar you know"". showing our approach to dealing with you and where you and Sean went wrong when countering us."

PS2Cobalt,36i7gm,RetOld,2,Wed May 20 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"You're giving way too much thought to that, I just didn't hit you enough and I should have, 2 months ago I would have. I'm way past the point of caring about things like winning against 2 lock-on Reavers at 3 am."

Because TR have no Organised Outfit since...2 years?   I can't say the proxy repair is op or not   Wow daikar you surprise me again and again.   Tell me how is it different when you jump a br10 and us jumping you with 12 pilots, both you and the br10 has no chance of winning. But when that br10 complains he gets told ""stay mad, stay bad"".    Easy. If you jump one guy with your 12 guys the guy have no chance at all, and don't come now with ""we do not jump single esf's"" because you do. If 1 Pilot jumps a br 10 he can actually learn from this (if he really want it, because this was how we learned to fly ( you too). With 12 people he is just dead, the only thing he learn is wow VIPERS are ganking again and the airgame is shit.   That's not to say I'm the best because I know I'm not   i remember you about your ACE PILOT title in twitch. You came from ceres and there you were an excellent pilot. The servers merged and you went from a excellent pilot to a good pilot to a mediocre pilot and thats why you fly in groups now, if you ask me.   Adapt or die   Yes you adapted...but to what and to which price is the question.   Wasn't BLNG created because you wanted the strongest air outfit in the game? But you soon realised it wasnt fun because there was nobody to challenge you? Well now you have a challenge, accept it and resurrect the name of you outfit and show us what you guys are really made off!   Finally this. Are you now entirely braindead? BLNG is dead atm there is punisher who plays actively and that was it. Saying this 5 weeks after the flight control changes is so fucking retarded.   Have fun beeing bad and get 1 kill every 20 minutes, if this is fun to you okay but stop this stupid and retarded textes about ""challenge"". But you ruin the whole airgame. And btw there are so many alts i swaer you if this continue all people will go to vanu and fly there, like in the old days everybody went to vanu to play ZOE max.  Edit: And one thing i can't get is why everybody is talking about XPWR and their ganking because your ganking with lockon guys and every shit you can get.

With 12 people he is just dead, the only thing he learn is wow VIPERS are ganking again and the airgame is shit.   That's not at all how I learned flying back on Ceres, the first weapon I got was the PPA and I learned most of my flying from pounding the ground. Everyone was doing it so nobody that was flying engaged eatchother. After a while ppl were complaining about ground pounders so I bought lockons and started using those to kill em, after a while I moved to fuel tanks. Never once have I learned anything from getting jumped by someone.   i remember you about your ACE PILOT title in twitch. You came from ceres and there you were an excellent pilot. The servers merged and you went from a excellent pilot to a good pilot to a mediocre pilot and thats why you fly in groups now, if you ask me.

I rarely got any ragetells on Cobalt but on Emerald ... Hahaha , I already have over 2000 + kills with it over there , since going heavy vs heavy is kinda meh , this is indeed more risky but highly more rewarding. Collecting certs for grenade bandolier / EMP combo.  Whenever I see allot of dedicated heavy hoe's (HA's infestation is much worse there ) I switch to my infil xD ,equip 3.4 Scope (My fav scope on ) Sas-R and say. I might even make a montage. However you need to know how to position urself well , and if ur pushing forward you need to watch those dots and observe the minimap closely, find cover peek out and shoot , dont be exposed if you dont have to , when its clear you start pushing forward , whenever you can force the enemy to come to you not the other way around , bait them , make them think that ur runing away then turn around and engage. Remember that they have plenty of bullets and you have 1 ;) , make it count ."

Complicated could be   Subterranean Nanite Analysis with all those generators and 'layers'. Bio labs Not all new players seem to know teleporters exist. Tech plant Generators, an SCU, tunnels,.. the base has a lot of ""content"" (call it w/e); same goes for amp stations I guess. Fort Liberty A lot of people still seem to not be able to find A point."
PS2Cobalt,36e4em,ThatsFear,1 point,Mon May 18 18:51:51 2015 UTC,Yeah complicated or even just unique e.g. Gourney Dam
PS2Cobalt,36e4em,taeerom,1 point,Mon May 18 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"Ssub Nanite Analysis might be complicated in theoretical base design, but it just devolves into a huge rain of certs for everyone involved without any chance at having fun. Can be compared to finding an awesome way of playing cookie clicker, you get tons of big numbers and rewards, but at the cost of not having fun (except the fun of getting rewards).  SNA might be better with almost empty map, as in 6v6 or maybe 12v12, But the amount of chokepoints and difficulty to both push in and out makes it a very difficult base to take without massive overpop."

PS2Cobalt,36e4em,Diskriminator,1 point,Tue May 19 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"I would avoid in general, except if you like 2 hours battles, aka farm from 1 or 2 spots...   As attacker, you have 2 options, (no matter if some players dont know about teleporters): farm for hours, or MAX crash the shit out of it and cap it in 2mins.   And as a defender, you have just 1 option, litteraly. Its to farm as long as you can, and beg that whole NC wont regroup and crash there to wipe floor with you...  But then again, thats my opinion and experience, you have yours, but PopCorn will make videos in the end..."

Then, you dont have option to save it, like, 0 options (as its missing air/vehicles approach). But yeah, why not. :) Dont mind me mate"

PS2Cobalt,36e4em,B4rr,1 point,Tue May 19 21:55:10 2015 UTC,If you know its location it's actually not that hard at all.

(A point is on lower ground btw) I don't think I've ever even been on the upper level of the middle section.

Teleporter rooms are entirely unshielded and must be accessed by the ground floor. This is bad because it means people with slow computers cannot safely use them as they do cause a bit of lag when used.    Also, the Jump Pads are one way, meaning it's suicide to take them to the landing pad unscouted, as you can't bounce back as you can in other Bio Labs..."

PS2Cobalt,36ak8r,Neodym1,-1,Mon May 18 10:30:17 2015 UTC,are this pics from the same minute? because i dont understand how the eastshore timer is on 1:20 for NC cap and Splitpeak is VS with no timer...and on the second pic Splitpeak is NC with a 2 min VS cap timer Oo. i need an explanation or i will say bullshit
PS2Cobalt,36ak8r,Oliver_Closeov,2,Sun May 17 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"Well spotted but that actually makes what this is showing even worse from the BKNE perspective.  They allowed a small group to cap split peak while they sat with a platoon on east shore ghost capping.  Nice trade for the 11% VS continent pop, who no doubt will get auraxicom substation while bkne zerg towards Onatha."
PS2Cobalt,36ak8r,Neodym1,-1,Sun May 17 22:12:40 2015 UTC,the problem is you dont see whats happend to the cap at eastshore or whats the situation there ... what happened between this two pics ... NC capped Splitpeak and after that VS are back on the points and have the timer on 2min. Thats means more or less 5-7 min for the NC cap and again 4-5 min to bring the VS to a 2 min cap timer. that can easy be 10-15 min between this pics!! if if its really 10-15 mins between them i have to say in this time a lot could have happend! and also the the pic of magpeashooter should show us that BKNE is joining a fight with 2 squads (and he dont know that because you cant see if there are 12 people in the galli) that is already overpoped ... but if 10-15 min have passed between the pics something happed on the 1:20 min cap for the NC on eastshore! the NC never caped it! this two pics dont make any sense! So i will call it big bullshit!!  edit: my guess is the second pic happend 3 mins before the first one! in this time BKNE dropped on an empty eastshore and in the meantime VS capped splitpeak !! so magpeashooter is telling us big bullshit! there are also more evidence for that theory
PS2Cobalt,36ak8r,Oliver_Closeov,2,Sun May 17 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"i agree, it's obviously not the true sequence of events (although we've all seen them do exactly what is dipicted), and yea probably snap shots 2 or 3 min apart, but still bkne could easily have saved splitpeak yet they chose the route with zero opposition :)  The thing is that they always claim they do this because capping is most important thing in game.  They totally disregard any notion of efficiency in that regard, and that fact that blobbing 1 base leaves the rest of their line undefended, so the net territory gains are often in favour of the other factions."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,5,Sun May 17 17:05:49 2015 UTC,The problems start when you have hundreds of people flocking to VS just to play HA with orion.
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aggregationn,2,Sun May 17 17:24:14 2015 UTC,I know quite a few people who have an NC alt for the Anchor and Cyclone. Is that a problem as well?
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Cornelisatorus,1 point,Sun May 17 20:26:44 2015 UTC,Yes.
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,4,Sun May 17 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"I dont quite necessarily see that as a problem, as i dont see an an influx of ""hundreds of people"" changing to VS to begin with. If you do, please show some proof to back it up. The only thing i noticed was some prominent people having their name related to the orion playing well, but they were skilled players before that, the orion did not make them better players.  I think its also a matter of perspective. When i see a base getting outpopped 30 to 70 i dont think "" ah nanites, those people zerging again"". Instead i think ""wow, so many people to feed my LMG/Carbine"" (Except when they have dozens of ESFs/Libs above the spawnrooms just waiting to unload the magazines of their AI weapons). By extension, i feel that people trying out the other factions adds to variety instead of generating a problem, but then again i can see where youre coming from too."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,2,Sun May 17 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"Again: i don't know how much you play NC and TR but it is very noticeable. There are quite some people with BR below 50 running around with the Betelgeuse - not to mention the late night squads full of BR100 playing almost exclusively HA with the BG. Your outfit is no exception. And no, i don't deny my outfit has HA main players as well but i am speaking about a whole faction leading by far for that matter."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,2,Sun May 17 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"It's not problem with HA class, but at one time there was an insane influx of players coming specifically to Cobalt to play Orion HA. Everyone noticed that, even VS players."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 17 22:10:04 2015 UTC,Since maxes have been widely accepted   No :(
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,1 point,Sun May 17 23:58:06 2015 UTC,It is not stronger. It is just that VS spams this class no matter what. VS main players and alts grinding for the Betelgeuse and then use it like there are no other weapons in this game. And Vs spamming HA and maxes IS one of the biggest problems - at least from these who can be solves by the community. So i talk about in on reddit. Simple as that.
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,1 point,Sun May 17 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Spamming maxes is indeed one of the biggest problems, putting HAs also at the same level of the max issue is not something I can agree with though. I don't mind at all if I encounter 12 heavies in a small/med fight, who cares if they have a shield, I have that too.   12 maxes on the other hand in the same small/med fight... is at least an order of magnitude more retarded. As for the BG, it's worse than the Orion but infinite ammo is hugely convenient, at least that's the reason I use it. I don't see that as a bigger problem than spamming shotguns, clays, pods or at least other 50 cheesy things you can do in this game."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,2,Sun May 17 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"The problem you have with the numbers. People should be encouraged to play other classes in this game. Otherwise you could just remove them and let them all play HA. So yeah, i can spawn a HA as well, but where's the point? I can spawn a Max as well to fight all the maxes (and sometimes i do). But it's insanely boring to play Max.  For the BG: This weapon is so special with the heat mechanic and the infiniate ammo that everyone wants it. It is not only a very, very good weapon that has VS-exclusive features. It also has the effect that VS players (and alts from NC/TR) more likely play HA. You have to auraxium 5 LMGs before and that has a huge impact on class usage.  You can tell you have a problem when NC and TR players refuse to fight VS because all they face is HA, Maxes, some snipers and PPA. And i had that quite often in TS when we discussed where to go. ""You wanna fight on TR or VS front?"" ""Let's go TR, i'm sick of the HA/Max spam!"""
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,SOLAR15,1 point,Mon May 18 05:46:39 2015 UTC,"The point is you can't play other classes that often if you want to deal with a max on every corner at cqc. (and even then you always risk to be instagibbed by retarded AI max weapons) Sure you can go LA whoring, which a lot of VS do regularly but c4ing a max is tricky if the opponent is not totally inexperienced.   The ""heavy problem"" is closely related to the max problem. You solve the later and the heavy numbers will plummet. Even then I don't think an equal numbers distribution of classes is the way to go tbh. The HA is the main infantry class in ps2 and it's only natural that there are more of them then let's say infils. They probably need a tweak to the overshield which I can agree but other than that they are alright as they can't jetpack, become invisible or revive people."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Mon May 18 11:27:26 2015 UTC,It's probably because the VS MAX is so shit that there are more HAs.
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,road-runn3r,1 point,Mon May 18 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the Orion is so easy for people to just pick up and play, it is not the same for the gauss saw and carv.  If the MSW and gd22s/anchor were starter guns for the other heavies, we would have more good heavies playing other factions.  If you play on miller there is much less disparity between the level of ha play between factions."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,choon2,1 point,Mon May 18 11:57:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Gauss Saw as a starting gun was always a big mistake which they never fixed. A bit less for the Carv but it's more accentuated by the fact that the VS starting weapon is the best VS lmg and doesn't even need more than 2 attachments to be maxed."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Mon May 18 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"Its like saying, hey my faction is too stupid to play heavy so therefore im gonna complain about your faction since they are not.  If NC as a faction on Cobalt were a little bit smarter, you would see plenty of heavies running around with especially cyclone, but also Anchor."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,choon2,2,Mon May 18 09:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are obviously too stupid. Personally i like giving myself some challenge. It can't be the meaning of a game to just play the most powerful things and forcing others to do the same. My motivation is not to get kills and more kills the easiest way possible. This game has so much to offer.  I mean look at Gylle: he can farm like hell but where's the point in getting another 100k kills with HA? With his skill he could easily farm as medic, infiltrator or whatever."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,0,Mon May 18 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Not everyone shares your opinion and not everyone has played this game for that long that they will find it boring to play HA only.   I dont think HA is too strong in all situations, the HA is too strong when you barely have any options to flank, there are no roofs or buldings either. There are plenty of bases where i take a dump on people being stubborn and play HA as either LA or infiltrator, just because the base design doesnt favour HA at all. I personally am I much better LA than I am a HA because it gives me freedom to be creative and stay unpredictable. It is true that HA is very strong, but as a HA you are gonna be very predictable in how you can move around bases. This is something that you as a LA can abuse like crazy.  There are also very few HAs that I have encountered who can counter a LA who stays unpredictable, a lot of times the constant changing of angles throws them off. A lot of if has to do with them playing mainly HA and dont understand how you play LA and thus struggle to counter a LA. This is where the HA only becomes an disadvantage, however it changes fast when you as a LA or infiltrator dont have the right cover, buildings or roofs to use to your advantage."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,OrionIsntOP,1 point,Tue May 19 13:34:51 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of the things you write are very true. But keep in mind i was not talking about HA being OP, i was talking about too many players playing it all the time. You have to admit that there are lots of BR100 who are almost exclusively playing HA. These players have a good amount of kills, certs and experience - yet they refuse to play other classes. And i wonder why that behaviour is so visible especially at VS.  As for HA being strong: It is strong when so many people play it. It is the same when everyone just plays MAX, it is the same when one faction choses to pull 48 lolpod ESfs and roflstomp everything. At some point you are forced to either play their game - or leave the fight. That is not satisfying at all for players who like playing other classes.  You are one of these players who play almost everything in this game. I don't mind if your main class (as anyone's main class) is HA. But at least you do play other classes a lot and don't run around as HA only.   What i just can't stand is this spam of HA. I mean just look at all the Bg heavies. this is not my imagination. I seriously questioned myself if it is just me paying too much attention to HA and whatnot. But i really focussed on that, spoke to the people i play with and looked at the numbers. My conclusion is that the usage of HA is just too high. Ever wondered why the other factions sometimes let VS win so easily and barely give a good fight? Because people are sick of facing all these HA and Maxes. it is not only a problem for TR and NC but also a problem for VS. As soon as the other factions start to think fights against VS are not fun then the fun will stop for everyone. Same goes - of course - the other way around when NC/TR outfits with inflationary HA/Max usage attack somewhere.  I mean i write this all on reddit and explain it, but playing on live and seeing something like that i just say ""fuck you"" and look for another fight."

From my experience i face far less HA when fighting Tr or NC. So no, it's not the ""cool"" thing or circlejerk, it's how it is."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 17 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a career heavy vs on cobalt. It's the first faction I rolled a d first class I got most unlocks for. The heavy class is perfect for my style of play.  I look for a fight where vs are outnumbered and go there to fight. That's how my outfit operates and we are very successful at pushing off 2, 3 and sometimes many more our numbers from bases. You cannot do this without HA. It's a front line class or mbt of infantry.  I see people whine about it a HA a lot. The truth is use the right tool for the job with minimal cheese imo.  If you are spamming maxes in 1 - 12 fights, that's too much cheese for me. If you want to run medic balls or light assaults when trying to fight against vastly superiors numbers, no cheese just wrong tool for job. Find a balance and play that way if you can live with your own level of cheese then fuck whiners."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Oliver_Closeov,2,Mon May 18 11:40:06 2015 UTC,"Whiner will whine, and then probably pull a max rather than learn heavy.    It's a shame the starter lmgs on nc and tr require a bit more practice to use but if you ever run into MCY or INI on miller you'll really question which factions have the best lmgs."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Mon May 18 12:09:19 2015 UTC,"""Learn heavy""? You mean like career heavys refuse to ""learn medic"" or ""learn infiltrator""?  It is funny how many ppl in this game can't get out of their comfort zone."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Oliver_Closeov,3,Mon May 18 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"My comfort zone is infil and heavy, so perhaps you'll be interested in my reply.  Any class game on the market requires one basic attribute, and that's the ability to pick the right tool for the job at hand.  That depends almost entirely on what you're up against and what you can realistically achieve against it.  In this game that also depends on the type of fight you go for, which for me almost always involves underpop.   HA is the main grunt for the battlefield, and as such a good HA can take on a squad of squishies with relative ease if conditions are favourable (note the ""relative"").  The problem is that said squishies rarely change out of their comfort zone to combat a heavy who can do this.  They change class to max, or they change to shotgun, but god forbid they change to heavy.  This is an observation, not a troll.  The best players I've come across are comfortable across multiple classes, and the best potential players I see, change to HA and choose their gun according to what their opposition is using.  A rare sight, hence my generalisation.  When HA is unrealistic for the task at hand in this game, so is Medic, unless you're in a squad.  LA is pretty gay, so I avoid it unless the base requires it (this is a particular hangup that I have from fighting VS LA's on woodman).  MAX is just like admitting defeat, so that leaves infil, which is challenging but awesome when you're up against a small group (eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgPKSVecTgY)."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,NerfDragonhawks,2,Mon May 18 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"I am trying to get this right: You want to farm squads of ""squishies"" (bad/casual players?) and you can only do that as HA? Because you do that they change to shotgun and Max?  If i understand that correctly then my question is: Why not farming a little bit less but rewarding you for playing another class a bit more?   Sometimes i get the impression that players like you only have thesen unfair fights where you can barely defend yourself and you HAVE to play HA. Yes, there are these fights and i play HA myself (and sometimes even max) - but not exclusively.  The really good players often disappoint me by not showing their versatility but rather only farmig casuals from some spot with Orion/BG/whatever. It is alright to do that but how about playing something else for a change? That's what i mean with getting out of the comfort zome. There are other examples of players who only do 2 or 3 different things in this game. Only farm with HE lightning, only tank, lolpod all day, always in a maxsuit... I can live with that because when you see the whole mass of players it's relative. But these HA... they are numbers - huge numbers!"
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Mon May 18 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"ok put it another way then, given that HA's are so numerous, what are HA's mostly having to fight."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,1 point,Mon May 18 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously other HA. If everyone spawns HA to fight more HA it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,-Zoobe,1 point,Mon May 18 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think your own play style is blinding you here.  You seem to think the only thing to do is farm. In case you haven't already worked it out, myself and Oliver are in same outfit.  We don't go to bases to farm, we go to bases to either defend or attack. We... play the objective. If this means having to cut through squishes then that's what we do. When you look at this action, you see if from a farming perspective. You have brought up your kd, no one else has. When we speak, we talk about tools for a job. Our perspective is the job of capping or defending a base. From your language, you appear to call this play style OPS where as we play that way every night.  Not fussed about kd, just interested in fighting a challenging fight and playing objectives.  As stated, to play this way, use the right tool for the job."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,bmstalker,1 point,Tue May 19 07:54:03 2015 UTC,"I brought up k/d in general because most HA only players do play for their k/d. No one can tell me anything else than that. If it were not for their beloved k/d they'd try some other classes once in a while.  And no, i am not blinded by playstyle. I know the difference between objectives and grinding pretty well. The number of HA is barely determined by objective play, you see even more of them defending bases in 50:50 fights just to grind kills. And that is what i am talking about."

PS2Cobalt,369o4s,bmstalker,1 point,Wed May 20 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"From what I see of blue hornets, you are a large outfit capable of fielding many squads. With numbers on your side, it makes sense to diversify as there are more heavies for the support classes to support. At least try to see the perspective of smaller outfits that require fielding heavies to fight with an acceptable degree of potency. It's not a matter of learning other classes, it's a matter of the correct tool for the correct job. If you play medic as a solo class and get steamrolled by a heavy, do you really think the fault is with the player who used the correct tool for the job? Or is it just easier to complain that the heavy is an op easy class rather than admit you were caught out of position as a support class and got what was coming?"
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Mon May 18 15:25:50 2015 UTC,"My outfit is exactly 70 members and we rarely have a full squad of infantry in any fight.  And no, i am not saying HA is OP, i am saying there are too many of them running around. What you do is the cause and effect argument: ""There are so many maxes and HA so i play HA as well!"" And others will face you only playing HA and do the same thing. At some point someone has to make a decision. When i play medic i usually do that alone or with - say - 3 or 4 players from my outfit at a base. And i get my k/d's between 2 and 3 with my medic weapons. Even though i fight so many HA. So i wonder how anyone can say it's all so unfair and i need to play HA to get kills? Sure you can be outnumbered and need something stronger. But as i said: these HA spams are everywhere."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,bmstalker,1 point,Mon May 18 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, no doubt you play ad you say but I see your outfit often. I always play under pop so you must often play over pop. As stated, you are playing support class with a lot of these heavies you frown up on to support. It's a different role, not front line combat where multiple enemies come at you at once, you are picking up the odd kill when your heavies have traded their life for health. If you wanted to get statistical to help you understand, compare your kpm to that of a equally skilled heavy. The medic is a support class. It works best when supporting the heavy plague you hate. Your play style is valid, hell I like having medic backup hating on heavies whist making out your superior skills put you above the need to play a combat class whilst in combat is a bit silly. I'm not here to call anyone out on skills, I've not looked at your stats because I don't care. I've no doubt a very skilled player could own multiple heavies as a medic but those players are few and far between and they would likely be capable of even more as a heavy. These really skilled players should find fights that challenge themselves though (I don't include myself here, I'm not a good player). Playing heavies in easy situations I would somewhat agree as unnecessary cheese."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Tue May 19 08:05:17 2015 UTC,"No, we don't play in overpop usually. We go for promising fights and we have enough experience to know what fights are fun with what population balance. Usually it's nice when you fight like 40:60 or 45:55 depending on the base.  And yes, you can state that medic is a support class. But as i told you before: If some players would try to play such a class sometimes instead of only HA grinding then fights would be more fun in general. And i can tell you: the medic has insane weapons. Once you fall in love with the Carnage, reaper and whatnot and learn to aim for the head you have a good and satisfying experience outskilling all these heavys. But if you are facing so many of them you can't really have that."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,syliner,1 point,Tue May 19 09:31:25 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty conflicted answer, I’m doing this from my phone but I’ll try to reply. “yes, you can state the medic is a support class”  Correct, your plan is for people to play less of the class you support and more of the support class.  What would you then support? “If some players would..more fun in general”.  You want people to swap away from heavy, so the game is more fun for your playstyle.  Medic guns are great, I love the HV-45 and terminus etc.  Again, you talk about outskilling heavies and appear to get a certain satisfaction from that.  That’s great, would you get the same satisfaction from “outskilling medics” in the same way?  You explain you have difficulties engaging multiple combat classes as a support class and instead of adapting, you want to change how others play.  You want them to swap to medic or some other support class to allow you to more easily deal with several enemies at once.  Your entire argument appears to be around “too many people play heavies for my liking, it would be easier if less people played heavies instead of me adapting to the situation I face.  I personally would find this more fun and will allow me to continue to play medic with more ease”.     I’ll also reply to other one here.  I didn’t say you didn’t know the difference between the play styles, but when you see a heavy, due to your particular outlook on the game, you think “oh, there’s another heavy farming, working on his KD”   “No-one can tell me anything else than that”.  So you’ve got your skewed perspective and you are unwilling to accept input to the contrary.  Ie blinded.  What I’m saying is that your bias is stopping you accept that a larger number of people that you’d like to believe play heavy for different reasons. I like to kill a lot and not be killed, I’m sure I could farm my KD up with my heavy if I really wanted by sitting in over-pop fights and killing light assaults as they try to break out of spawn.  But I far prefer playing as part of a tight-night squad of 3-8 people (our normal squad size) and find fights where we are out numbered.  We look for a fight where enemy has preferably 70% or more overpop, we go there and fight until we either win, or we re-deploy out if our faction drops too many people and we end up in over-pop.  The people I play with play a lot of heavy, they have a similar outlook on the game."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,2,Tue May 19 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"You pin this all down on me. Again, dude: It is NOT fun to play other classes than HA if the other faction has that huge amount of HA. it is not about my personal playstyle, it is about the fact that there are other classes existing in this game - and they have a gun! That might come as a shock to you. You can play other classes. The big majority of players playing HA - and so many playing them exclusively is not about me and my little personal, biased - whatever you call it - view.  It is in indicator that a lot of players don't give a shit about all the possibilities you have, all the classes you can play. They want to kill people and apart from stuff like max/HE/lolpod it's easiest done with a HA.Maybe you are an exception, i don't know, i can only believe you or not. But man, i know this community long enough and i tell you: This is not about tactics, objectives and whatnot. It is about k/d and farming. If a player with 10k+ kills with the Orion/BG/SVA tell me it's about objectives and directives i have a good laugh. heck i played the gauss saw until i had 4k kills with it when i was a complete scrub. But all these BR100 and alts running around as HA 90% of their time? Nah..."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,bmstalker,1 point,Tue May 19 10:38:42 2015 UTC,one question. why shouldnt i use the medic as combat class?
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Aloysyus,1 point,Tue May 19 10:49:31 2015 UTC,I have no idea who you are and what your outfit is. But i can tell you that i see the HA and Max spam in all kinds of fights. There are these players who don't give a fuck - they play HA with 10 to 90% or with 80 to 20%. Because my poor k/d.
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,syliner,1 point,Mon May 18 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the comparison between max spam and the common use of HA. The simple fact is that HA is THE combat class and medics etc are support classes.  Of course HA will be the most common.  Maxes are tool that imo should be spared for anti air and occasionally anti armour if the tank spam is too bad for heavies. The reason I don't learn other classes is that in the battle where my outfit fight, there is reduced need for them. If my squad needs an infil with spotter, I'll do it. Need a medic to ""support"" several heavies that are already present and more efficient at killing than me? Sure ill do that but simply, HA can take the most punishment and get the most done. A requirement to fight in constant under pop. Tell me, how does blue hornets deal with fighting in constant under pop? Oh wait...  Edit.  Also goes without saying that generalising everyone who plays a certain class will not make you look well informed. Different people play heavy for different reasons. Don't flame the class, flame the people who use tools that have too much cheese for the job at hand."
PS2Cobalt,369o4s,Nuklartouch,2,Mon May 18 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"First: I don't ""flame"" anyone. Flaming is a whole different thing, i am discussing it and stating my opinion.  That being said i am doing exactly that: I talk about ""people who use tools that have too much cheese for the job at hand."" And not only did i always say that everything is fine to some extent - HE, Max, lolpod, PPA, whatever. You can do all that, it's fine, the game has different things to offer. And i don't say the class is shit- I say - again - that the usage of this class by players is inflationary high. I am reminding them that there are other classes, that a good k/d by only playing HA does not mean you are a better player. That it's frustrating to face a wall of HA (and maxes) in every fight.   That does not mean you should stop playing HA. That does not mean i don't play it. But when a whole faction get most of their kills with LMGs i ask why. Hopefully i will get some new numbers soon. Mine might be outdated but on the battlefield it doesn't seem like it.  My outfit: I can actually say that me and my outfitmates usually play their favourite class or finishing their auraxium medal with some weapon rather than going into fights where you ""need"" to play HA or Max or whatever. Of course we do that sometimes but we usually go for good fights in the first place. We have players who don't give a shit about their k/d and we have players who will just change the fight if they just can't play medic or LA for shit in the current one. If i face all the usual VS heavies in a fight i won't stay there long becausei don't see any point to let myself getting forced into other peoples playstyles. Just as i refuse to - say - use tomcats in air fights. Waht my outfit does depends a lot on what we do at that very moment. Just chilled playing or OPs... if we do OPs we try to have the usual supporters, some HA, even a max. But real OPs (and i mean ""real"" operations, not zerging down a lane) are not everyday's play and no one can tell me all these HA come from outfits who just want to get shit done. they want to farm and keep their k/d stable."

Our outfit has been made to welcome new players and create as much links between them as possible. Basically, we are able to play however we want to. From open platoons for casual playing to ServerSmash squad. The SCU at Elli (on which Fara was impressed and Patty was angry to lose in a 50/50 fight) and the harassers during the last SS ? Our squad.  When we can, we set-up a special format of open platoons : 1 PL, 4 SL and commandos (ie experienced MB1 players) in the same teamspeak channel. What's the difference ? We put all the best players of the platoon in the same squad, we put the best squad leader at its head, and we send them doing missions to help the rest of the platoon. It's not uber-MLG squads, but it's better than a normal open squad.  We regularly run commando squads which are tactical squads. During fun squads, sometimes we go solo or farm our directives. And sometimes we take our reavers and libs and go for airfights.  We have a logo and different Ops through the week. We have a MB1-only operation every Saturday, which is a casual event. We had 3 operations lately with KAIN which is one of the top NC outfits on Cobalt and are planning to re-schedule them during the Fridays. These are tactical platoons.  More information here : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/mainbattalion#events  NB : I am waiting the feedback from KAIN to schedule our next operations. To be done soon."

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,LeClipperChip,19,Fri May 15 12:31:20 2015 UTC,"I have no problems with AA or AV maxes, that to me is how they should be. But fuck people who pull AI maxes, and especially fuck the people who pull maxes in 1-12 or 12-24 fights simply because they are just shit at infantry play."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Aggregationn,5,Fri May 15 12:36:33 2015 UTC,"There's some great ideas how what you can do with AI MAX. Having 1-2 being key parts of your squad, using them as force multiplies to take on higher numbers.  The problem is that MAXes don't require any support. So you can be super serious, pull 2 maxes, and have 10 guys play the game to get the most out of these 2. But you'll just lose to 11 MAX and one infi to run after everyone is dead to flip the point. MAX are currently a super class that beat all other classes, just because they cost resources.  Remove charge (nerf to rushes form spawn room), bring in the AV Mine Vs MAX (nerf to max drops) and give MAX armour its own resistance allowing you to bring in an Anti-Max Primary weapon for heavies. Suddenly MAXes in terms of squad vs squad are balanced, MAX > Normal Infantry > Anti-Max Heavy > MAX.  Squad composition now becomes a bigger part of the game, There's no more ""unbeatable"" squad. Your enemy has a lot of MAXs take Anti-Max Heavies, too many Anti-Max Heavies, take normal LMG's, too many normal Infantry pull a max."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,BlckJck103,3,Fri May 15 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"I've got my fingers crossed that the rocket rifle is going to be the Anti Max hero we need and if it replaces primary slot weapons it fits nicely into your infantry combat triangle, that is as long as it isn't as effective as rocket primary at both MAXes and Infantry lol."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Squiggelz,1 point,Fri May 15 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"The only other problem is that MAX weapons would need a nerf, probably at expense of their armour value being improved against light arms.  Currently even an Anti-max rifle is useless if 12 can just charge at you and one shot you with shotguns."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,BlckJck103,1 point,Fri May 15 15:54:35 2015 UTC,Increase in resistances to any weapons that don't get tagged as 'Anti Max' would be a step towards making them support/tanks and then a nerf to damage output to balance it so they don't remain the walking free kill generators they are currently. Doubt we'll ever see such a change though...
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Squiggelz,1 point,Fri May 15 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"yeah it's all a pipe dream the worst thing is though, compared with resource revamp or new maps, or what ever else they promise, this would be less work for a much bigger gain."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,BlckJck103,1 point,Fri May 15 16:22:43 2015 UTC,Tbh I'm still convinced the main reason that isn't happening is because MAX weapons probably get them a lot of income.

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,BlckJck103,2,Fri May 15 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. AI maxes are a good idea, but in their current implementation they are broke as fuck. 1 MAX can solo an entire squad and even if he dies, he can still get revived. The prospect of a max should be big, slow and heavily armored. It shoult not be a heavy with more guns and health with an insta speed boost."

Charge is currently the worst thing about MAXes. Not only will we create a super-soldier that will beat every other class we'll also give that class the ability to safely get from a spawn room to the capture point."

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Sotanaki,2,Fri May 15 13:59:11 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, 1 flak max is ok ... rarely gets a kill and is a deterrent to G2A. lets be honest, a single lockon really isnt a deterrent. You need a group to make that viable.  But groups of AA maxes are strong. I think you will struggle to find much support for removing something that protects ground based infantry fights ...    But fuck people who pull AI maxes, and especially fuck the people who pull maxes in 1-12 or 12-24 fights simply because they are just shit at infantry play.   Similarly fuck the groups of people who do the same with bulldog gals/ Lolpods/ Zephyr libs.  Honestly now, I see very little difference to getting lolpodded/Ai nosegunned at a small fight after midnight, and using A2A lockons in the air.  Remove flak/lockons for all I care as long as AI capability of Air is removed aswell.  But sadly they wont, and its something we have to deal with in the game"

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,BananenMatsch,3,Fri May 15 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"Tbh, they should rebuff the AoE on AV nades and Concs so even then MAX hordes can be dealt with easier.  That being said we're trying to improve the server's standard of play, and some outfits seem resolved to go backwards. For what, ""NO! Our faction cannot lose a base"", which given that territory is meaningless anyway, is doubly retarded. Several outfits that should know better are just avoiding confronting a problem by throwing 12-24 MAXs at bases they already outpop 60-70% and already have MAX hordes at. Quite often this past week, we've been attacking at 40% (us) vs 60%, and then a massive Max zerg comes in, you know, as many MAXs are there are softies just charge in, and wipe you all. Funny thing is that crash is often the second or sometimes third attempt at it, it's just that each time more MAXs are pulled. Problem is the first crash and general point defense against pub MAXs eat your consumables up, and then you can't counter the crashes anymore. We're really improving at these and soon enough big MAX crashes won't solve shit, doubly so if they get a few nerfs over the coming months. Which given the console release, you can fully expect.  That's all well and good, it's live after all, but nobody should be surprised if this merry band of MAXs doesn't get selected for the next Serversmash tournament."

My squad had enjoyable fights on Hossin yesterday, until certain NC outfit, that overuses giraffe camo, started dropping on our head, which basically made all hossin fights ghostcaps.

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Oliver_Closeov,2,Fri May 15 14:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'm really okay with MAX drops from Gals. That is a legitimate amount of planning and organisation being used to win a battle. I solidly appreciate that they took a gal. Respect.   The redeployment fucks over the game. The timers on bases are too long to allow people to instantly deploy to every defense on the front. I have played in a VIPR squad lead by a great PL (didn't catch his name)  and he admitted for the first 40 minutes we were gonna redeploy to stop the TR and NC fighting us. We took part in dull defense after dull defense, and made sure no-one had any fun. So they went and had fun with each other. The VS was able to win the Alert.   I don't dislike that player, I hate that it is the most effective tactic in the game.  Way more game ruining than Max units. Which need a balance pass."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Spartancfos,2,Fri May 15 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"I am not talking about gal drops with maxes in general, problems with that even if I hate playing maxes in general.  I am talking about extreme reactions, not even alerts. A few days ago 1 and a half VIPR squad was capping a nc base, and if you see all for sudden 4 MB1 gals incoming (fair enough, it was after an alert) 70-80% of them maxes and reaching a pop of 80+% is nothing i can label as tactical. Nor organised, other than 'pull maxes my lemmings pull maxes'.  Regarding VIPR gameplay; sometimes we are engaging fast warpgating attacks to have garanteed underpopped fun, sometimes its helping out during the alerts and defending bases. And sometimes it just playing on an underpopped country for good fights."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Spartancfos,1 point,Fri May 15 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"I mean the over reaction thing is a bit much. But I wouldn't blame them, as alot of the time it's just impossible to divide up a big platoon because there are no strong squad leads with individual leadership talent available. In that case it's often a necessary evil to over commit forces to a base, generally the goal is draw in an attack from greater numbers, and I would generally avoid it as a defensive action unless I was in the area.   Both Kain and MB1 both play a resource heavy game, just like TFDN, fighting them means fighting force multipliers. I think the goal is to ensure their platoon punches above its weight, and needs to be countered by 2 enemy platoons. I am not familiar with the TR outfit that does the same.  It's not tactical but it can strategic.   I wasn't criticising VIPR. And I am sure you guys do lots of fun ops outside of alerts, but the fact is you play to win, and the majority of winning an Alert right now is clever redeploy. That and owning Eisa, or the North WG on Indar. The game has grown stale from a lack of interesting Gameplay."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Spartancfos,1 point,Fri May 15 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"Critic is always welcome, best way to improve.  To come back to the topic, we aren't playing SS, and I am not even talking about alerts. They can't think about simple attacks, however it always needs to be something big. Something exclusive just to 'rekt' the others.  For example; Nade spam a room with a few HA, LA or/and infils. It would be even half price if we look at the nanite costs. Easy game, easy move."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,MartyJC,1 point,Fri May 15 14:39:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly I want to see the game improved so that Tactical units have more relevance. The game focuses everything into funnels, which allows these zerg formations to choke a fight out."

Have a look at these screenshots from yesterday:   TR attacking Chimney Rock Depot with 96+, 85% pop TR attacking Wokuk Watchtower with 96+, 75% pop  VS attacking NC Arsenal with 96+, 58% pop   Those 2 TR screenshots were taken at exactly the same moment, and the VS one a few minutes later. There aren't ANY tactics that NC could use that would let us save those bases, there were simply too many people attacking us at that point.  Although I'd like to point out that the above isn't anyone's fault, it's just due to bad game design. That alert started with 50+% NC territory control so it's only natural that NC would get attacked the most, as they had the most lattice connections to the other factions. TR didn't really have much choice but to zerg simply because they had so little territory to begin with! I think alerts would be much more fun if they started with 33/33/33 territory control."

PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Bird267,-5,Fri May 15 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Planetside ;)   I don´t know why ""tacticaloutfits"" dont just react to such a behaviour. I mean, it´s somehow annoying, but why don´t u just redeploy and cap another base in that time. If u want to have proper infantry fights, planetside 2 is not the right game for that. Scrim or play PSBL for that...but on live server it´s all about caps. And in the end it does not matter how u won an alert or captured a base.  We just have to rethink all this overpop/max ""problem"".  You were able to capture a Base and ur enemy was not smart enough to stop u our capture another base in the same time while u had overpop?...GJ."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,SOLAR15,5,Fri May 15 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"I was reading through and thinking ""Nah"" i won't bother commenting and then this little gem popped up!. So your solution to unbalance in the game is to ""Redeploy and cap a base without such resistance"".   Mastermind stuff, Why didn't i think about that."
PS2Cobalt,361y6z,Bird267,1 point,Fri May 15 16:46:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe u unterstood me wrong or i just didnt write it clear enough. I am as annoyed as u r when things like that happen. I just stopped to think about it that much anymore because it´s just part of the game. I like equal infantry fights and i also think that ps2 would be a better game without maxes for example. With caping another point in that time i do not mean that u should ghostcap. In prime time alerts for example it makes sense to attack an empty base because there is a 99% chance that ppl redeploy to save it. It´s just about what u want to achieve in pl2. My goal is to work for a good communication in my fraction and win the alerts and do some good squad coordinated sruff. If i want 2 play 50%50 equal infantry fights i log into CS:GO"
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,zoodokoo,7,Fri May 15 11:12:27 2015 UTC,"Should affect tomcats even more severely than it does right now too tbh, wingmounts shouldn't decide air to air combat anyway, just leads to cancer like LPPA/Coyote or A2AM Scythes having a good chance to take on a fuel pod/nosegun Mossie."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,NerfDragonhawks,1 point,Fri May 15 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think coyotes are that bad tbh. I mean I flew for a long time, but I couldn't beat  anyone from BLING in a 1v1 dogfight using coyotes. I'd do more damage than I could using only a nosegun, but I'd loose almost every fight. You can't possibly have problems taking on coyote users at your skill-level. Do you really see them as a big problem?"
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,NerfDragonhawks,7,Fri May 15 12:25:25 2015 UTC,"1 versus 1 it might be okay but not everyone is in BLNG and the very fact coyote PPA is viable just ticks me off (I also don't like all the shitty Mossies running Banshee Coyotes or Banshee Tomcat).   Furthermore, in group fights it's automatically game over, if you fight 2 people and only one of them has coyotes you will lose."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-2,Fri May 15 12:36:28 2015 UTC,So 1v1 it's okay but facing multiple enemies is hardmode.   You feel that with the amount of skill you've got you should be able to simply take on two A2A centric aircraft and win without bringining at least one wingman to assist you.   Aren't you a special snowflake. So cute how you feel entitled to go 2v1 and win.  #TomcatTriggered.

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-2,Sun May 17 09:54:29 2015 UTC,"Lockons are love, lockons are life.  I also don't twist people's words. Majority of pilots don't consider lockon a problem on live when the face people like me or even bit higher skilled in a simple 1v1 fight. They just AB straight in and one clip the tomcat user while simultaneously writing him the /tell messages.  So the discussion from usual suspects is ""Well they aren't that amazing in 1v1, but i'm always hating them when i get jumped by [INSERT NUMBER HERE] ESF and i'm soloing"". Which is almost word to word what Brutalyflops did here.  I defend lockons because i consider them ""mostly"" balanced in their current state. Respect is earned and so far in this thread only Punisher and Daikar have discussed this issue from a perspective of actual balance and earn the little respect i'm willing to give."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Marthalion,1 point,Sat May 16 09:22:57 2015 UTC,"Yes you do twist people's word. The first comment I read from you in this thread was one where you immediately accused someone of being a skyknight for no reason. And here you jump NerfDragonhawks calling him other derogative shit and say that ""he feels entitled"" to win 2v1 when what he said was that you have zero win chance 2v1 if coyotes get involved. There's a large gap between ""I feel entitled to win"" and ""There should be a chance still"".  Discussing is not about calling people names and purposely twisting what they say to something that will fit your image of things better. Ruining a discussion however, is about exactly that. If you want to involve any sort of respect and discussion in this, you should stop acting the latter way."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,0,Sat May 16 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"You should be participating in every numerically unfair engagement with expectatin to loose and when you've got such mentality lockons or coyotes do not play any considerable part in equation.  They will reduce the engagement time of the outcome but hardly will they change the end result of the engagement.  So what are are talking here about is seasoned pilots wanting to go against intermediate pilots and shit on them. They used to go 2v1 or even 3v1 and at least take out one or two out of the bunch. They feel that they want to have that again but tomcats and coyotes effectively prevent that from happening since they reduce the engagement time of 2v1 from around 25-30sec into the 15 sec territory while covering each others weakness.  That is entitlement whining in a nutshell. You feel that you should win against the odds without adopting to the situation or playing in a particular way to present you with best chance to achieve victory.  Against Coyotes:   Stealth/FireSup/Hover | Stock/ABTanks. Stealth/FireSup/Hover | Rotary/Tomcats.  Against Tomcats:  Stealth/Flares/Racer | Rotary/ABTanks. Stealth/Flares/Racer | Stock/Coyotes.  It's that simple, absolutely no one does it though. Everyone is a special snowflake that is demanding that they be granted victory against a vehicle that does twice the DPS than their ""starter kit"" ESF. Or they face against hard counters without a single shred of evidence of adapting to situation and then i see the same people complaining here that tomcats are OP or coyotes are OP."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Marthalion,1 point,Sun May 17 09:39:48 2015 UTC,"You see, now you are doing it again. All he said was that if you go 2v1 and one of them has coyotes, you WILL lose. He never said that he expected to win that 2v1 without coyotes. That's something that you extrapolated on your own and from that you feel entitled to insult him.  You need to listen to what people say, not just slap them into with me or against me categories. Such behaviour only creates divides, disrespect and wrecks the community."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,0,Sun May 17 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"But if three people of identical skill go against each other the guy who is the underdog will loose. The chances of going against Coyotes or against competent people are almost identical.  It's the nature of 2v1 combat and going 2v1 and winning only applies to complete beginners and people who do not know how to get everything out of their airframe build.   You have no chance of winning in either situation so where the complains come from. Oh i know, they come from your expectation to go 2v1 against somewhat worse pilots and come out feeling really good about shreking them. That is you have no chance if you don't prepare yourself for such situation by narrowing your build to specific goals and playstyle.  Entitlement to win in an unfair to you situation. Nothing less nothing more."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,0,Sun May 17 13:41:05 2015 UTC,So weapon specifically designed to engage air and nothing but air should not decided air to air combat. Flawless logic.  Does this A2AM cancer against your skynight FuelPods/Nosegun mossie apply to reaver or only to scythe?.
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,LeKunibert,1 point,Fri May 15 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"No, they really should not decide the air combat.  In my opinion, they should drastically change the purpose of them, meaning they should not mainly be used as a damage source but force you to turn around and face your  opponent if you were running from someone."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-1,Fri May 15 19:39:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a slight nerf to damage to bring the tomcats into balanced state where it requires one extra missile to kill an ESF.  I wouldn't mind a minimum lock range of above 100m but a slightly extended range on them by 50m at least. So they fill the long range niche better in concept.  I wouldn't mind an engagement radar either reducing the lock time or extending the the range of tomcats reach. I wouldn't mind if it was squad linked. So one Reaver could buff tomcats of up to three others within 100m range.

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,0,Sat May 16 13:08:47 2015 UTC,Admirable. I avoid using stuff that i consider not well balanced either.  Thats why i haven't got on ESF Fire Supression certed but i don't have anything against people who use it.   Same reason i don't use vanguard shield either. It's not that it's unbalanced but enemy basically needs to know that it's doing damage since otherwise they will feel like they've been cheated out participating in the engagement. Doing something is better than doing nothing and doing something but not getting absolutely anything out of it feels extremely cheap.   Still wish they'd deny people jumping out of ESF's at certain altitude without the Ejection Seat installed.
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Punisher_Ps2,2,Sat May 16 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I would say that it would be great if it would do something against coyotes and locks, on the same level. Not that it should nullifie coyotes or locks, but maybe the fail chance of them is 40% or something when stealth is equipped and maxed out. What I hate about those weapons is when there are people using them as primary and not as SECONDARY weapon and it shouldn´t be possible to use them as primary/spam them like retarded.   Like a scythe with lppa/coyotes and only barrel rolls, loops etc. is incredibly good and you don´t really need to aim and it is really hard to hit/outdps it. The bug/feature is good, but not in the current state cause it is unbalanced (make it more 50/50 with coyotes and tomcats). And tomcats need a big ass nerf.  TL;DR: The bug/feature is good, but not in the current state, cause it is not balanced out. Tomcats need a nerf and using secondaries as primaries is retarded and has to go."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-2,Sat May 16 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"What if your nosegun had a fail chance of 40% after you spin it up for 6 seconds straight. Reasonable isn't it?.  Because that's the average time between start of lock, achieving lock and missile travel time till impact.  I wouldn't mind tomcats taking one extra hit to kill an ESF. Anything else and the current tomcats that went through ""balance passses""(nerfs) become a far bigger liability than an asset without any of the versitility of other ESF weapons.  Still waiting till they make Hornets primary AP and Rocket Pods primary AI's. So that one can reliably hit vehicles like a ton of bricks while other has splash but does no damage to vehicles."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Punisher_Ps2,0,Sun May 17 09:47:24 2015 UTC,"Still waiting till they make Hornets primary AP and Rocket Pods primary AI's. So that one can reliably hit vehicles like a ton of bricks while other has splash but does no damage to vehicles.   Fully agree on that.  To the tomcat thing I would like if they made some kind of hornet a2a missile out of it with the coyotes mechanic. That would be fun to use and effective. Imo the current tomcats are boring as fuck, my opinion tho."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-1,Fri May 15 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"So you fire it first and then track it till the coyote mechanic picks up the proximity lock?   I would be on board with that as long as missile would have acceleration mechanic like the old falcons.   Liability in CQC, Massive advantage at range. They either need to be extremely spammable if they don't provide the hit success rate of the current ones or a specific long range at which they achieve current success of hits.  For me tomcats need to be better than noseguns because of the role they fill but it doesn't meen that i don't approve hard limitations on the capabilities if they further build up diversity in weapons."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Punisher_Ps2,0,Fri May 15 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"So you fire it first and then track it till the coyote mechanic picks up the proximity lock?    Yeah like that. Ofc you have to adjust the muzzle velocity and damage. Maybe more damage to libs and less to esfs, like they wanted to implement. I would like give those weapons, like coyotes and tomcats the deserved secondary role, so it shouldn´t be to spamable, cause that would be boring again and why is it than in the secondary slot, when you can use it as effeciently as your primary weapon."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-2,Fri May 15 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say you can use tomcats as primary though.   Their TTK is very long on their own. They're great in group support and with a wingman but when flying solo i'd rather try my luck with nosegun and ab tanks to be fair.  I see where your coming from. Logically considering that since they're in secondary slot they should take the secondary role. I can respect that.   My perspective is that since they're A2A centric to such a degree that they by design cannot damage anything other than air they share equal place with primary slot. Basically an ESF loaded with A2A options in my opinion should have twice the killing potential than one that does not. In such a scenario the current tomcats and coyotes are more or less ""balanced"" and need only tweaks to further solidify their performance in specific scenarios where they should excel at.  Against libs they would have to do a lot of damage. As it is now a kestrel with AB tanks on a racer ESF is what i've singled out as the best Anti Lib loadout so far. The kestrel isn't great in ESF combat but the magazine capacity, high firerate and over time DPS make it absolutely lethal to Liberators. Racer and AB tanks meen that you can' always keep yourself at extreme ranges where dalton looses almost all effectiveness."

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Daikar,1 point,Sat May 16 09:04:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any confirmation that this is anything more than a bug. Stealth should help against it but not completely nullify it, maybe give the lock a 20%-60% chance to fail depending on rank.  But I really don't think stealth needs a buff against tomcats, 1 sec extra is huge imo and any more than that would render lockons pretty much useless against it.  Im hoping this will lead to less bailassualts and NAR and more engis with stealth."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Aloysyus,2,Fri May 15 14:11:32 2015 UTC,We tested it on PTS: stealth throws off 100% of the Coyotes. Every missile hitting were direct hits.
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,1 point,Fri May 15 16:01:47 2015 UTC,It's actually a really good thing.   It puts stealth on a completely different playing field and extends it's usability. Further building up it's position as niche feature against niche weapons.  Having a stealth ESF with Rotary/AB and Stealth/FireSup go Against Coyotes NAR/FireSup would be a fairly equal playing field.  As is having an ESF with Rotary/AB Stealth/Flares go against Tomcat fielding ESF's is right now a very viable tactic that nobody ever bothers to use.  I for one welcome this.

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Daikar,1 point,Fri May 15 13:46:42 2015 UTC,"The problem is that new pilots get confy with the lockons and don't improve after a certain point. I do however think lockons are great to use until you can controll the aircraft good enough to make the switch to fuel tanks. Problem is most new pilots never make the switch and just stick to what they know work.  Also you have to realize that most pilots that use lockons are ground players who doesn't really want to improve in the air, they pull them to get rid of a2g farmers. And it's your opinion that the best part of the game is to be able to improve your piloting over time and not everyone has the same opinion."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,NerfDragonhawks,1 point,Fri May 15 14:10:56 2015 UTC,There's no incentive for them to switch because tomcats are just too strong and the downsides that typical 'crutch weapons' have that make them less desirable for intermediate/high skilled players aren't there.

Seeing an ace pilot fly around your territory and killing everything he comes across without challange is the most pitiful type of play in PS2 and these people think they're great for doing it. Apperently shreking someone who doesn't know how to reverse maneuver just because you used a nosegun and not tomcats is now a good performance and the more you kill the better you can stroke your E-penis about yourself being good.   They pick the best ESF loadouts that will give them the most benefits and pick the best guns for the job to pull it all off and then go hunting for people who neither have the skill to react nor skill to impact them in combat.

Just respect what others do and do your own stuff.   You are tired of skyknights flying around? Just do what you want, gank them with tomcats, why not? If they cry afterwards it's not your fault, you just used what the game gives you. But just think the other way round, if anybody does not want to use rockets you can't force him to do so. I can understand your love for tomcats, though I use fuelpods because I just can't really manouver without them.

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Cornelisatorus,1 point,Fri May 15 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"Debunk me this: does it help new players if THEY are the victims of lockons? Are they inclined to get better if lockons are being used in the air? Do they learn that if they get better, they will be able to do something against lockons or not? Is it fun for the majority if fighting in the air consisted mostly of point-and-click adventure, or would the air be just a fun minigame you play for a few minutes, but get bored after a few days, let alone after weeks, months, years? Dont forget, lockons are not only available to the noobs."
PS2Cobalt,361rt4,Daikar,5,Fri May 15 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"No not really but that same logic can be applied to all the other weapons, does it help a new pilot if he gets APd by a vanguard? No not really, so lets nerf those. Does it help a new pilot when he gets jumped by a rotary reaver, no not really so lets nerf that too, etc etc.  Id have to assume that this new pilot isnt an idiot and can think objectively about why he died. If he died to lockons he can run stealth, that will give him more time to run behind something to break the lock, he is now learning how to combat lockons. And if that isn't enough he can run flares on top of that for an even bigger advantage. He is now learning different loadouts instead of just running NAR+FS.  Having said that I do think they need to be changed so that it would be easier for new pilots to learn from them. For example when you start locking someone, that should spot you on the minimap the same way shooting the nosegun does. Reduce the turning rate so that you can dodge them if you turn at the right time using the minimap to see how close the missile is (in game tip should tell you about this if you get killed by lockons).  Do that and then if they are still too powerfull we can start nerfing the dmg/reload speed etc."

PS2Cobalt,361rt4,RetOld,-1,Sat May 16 11:51:50 2015 UTC,I enjoy tomcats.   I don't want to get better because i dont share the same mentality or values regarding gaming as you do. If i get better it's a natural progress for me but it's not something that i strive for nor something i put any value on since this is just a game. People tell me i'm shit and i don't mind it at all because it's 100% true. People tell me i'm shit and i tell them it's why i use tomcats and why i prefer staying shit. It gives me excuse to be a tomcat hero i always wanted to be and enjoy one of my favorite weapons in game.  I enjoy the point and click adventure i get and fallowing the missile travel on target. Every tomcat hit is euphoric fedora tipping experiance and nothing is better when the enemy is at 420meters blaze range where you can fire a second tomcat before the first one impacts negating the relock cycle. Yesterday Brutaliflops was escaping from my reaver and i managed to fire 5 tomcats in succession without breaking a lock while chasing him. I literary came rainbows from it.   It made my evening perfect gaming experiance and you're being a dick for trying to take this away from me. If they nerf tomcats i'll simply form 48 man ground peasant airballs and shove them down every pilots throat like we used to back in the day.

Calling out all the those targets that come from entrances you/your buddies are already guarding and can handle doesn't really seem productive. Instead you should just call out if you need reinforcements at a location cause you have to retreat from there or got killed.
PS2Cobalt,362c1c,schumuchen,5,Fri May 15 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure I can speak for the whole NC, but here's my POV. Due to the rush on Ikanam it left the only 2 contact points for TR/VS as Bastion/Ikanam. Neither of these was pushed, leaving a big weight on the NC border (not calling out coop ... its just how the map was. I waouldnt have attacked either).  So all you can do is let the zerg roll over you calmly whilst you farm them. They get the alert win and are happy, I get a load of kills and am also happy."

In the second half, NC got doubleteamed by TR/VS, just due to the layout of the map. There was ONE capture between TR/VS in the 2nd half, while NC lost 19 bases in the last hour.  Ikanam/Bastion are very difficult to push out from or capture, so the majority of TR steamrolled south into NC territory."

PS2Cobalt,35zckw,Rangerdanvers,0,Fri May 15 06:51:02 2015 UTC,"And I can understand that but at the same time 1v1s aren't something you should count on when flying on live. I always scout for incoming enemies and try to plan accordingly. And a good fight is subjective, not everyone enjoys a 1v1. I just wish there was a button you could press (with a cooldown) to call for help from your faction, that would ping your location on the map."

PS2Cobalt,35zckw,elbifo,2,Fri May 15 12:13:33 2015 UTC,I have a Dream. The Dream that one day zerg fights will be ineffective and platoon leader choose to do smaller battles. But this will never happen because the core idea of the lattice system wants to prevent that.

PS2Cobalt,35zckw,MartyJC,0,Thu May 14 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"I apologize in the name of all the platoon leaders and players zerging on Planetside 2.  When the NC has an overpop and there is less people to fight than NC on the whole frontline, we will now log out and we will flog ourself IRL until a Master Race Redditor sends us a PM asking us to come and be farmed at a certain base.  We will stop overpopping 3-point bases at 1 hex from our warpgate while there is an alert and let our faction be butchered on bases which can only be taken with 60% pop.  We won't redeploy anymore in strategical bases being lost with 60% enemy pop, to let our enemies have a fair fight.  Finally, we won't go anymore to the last capturable bases when there is 4 minutes left on the timer, giving our victory to the new Masters.  Or you can go and buy CSGO"
PS2Cobalt,35zckw,shurriken,9,Fri May 15 04:23:57 2015 UTC,He didn't even mention MB1 but I think it speaks volumes that you instantly get defensive over him mentioning NC zergfits that overpop decent fights :)
PS2Cobalt,35zckw,lSniperwolfl,3,Thu May 14 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"Or you can go and buy CSGO     Yes, because what I said is that I wanted 100% balanced, infantry-only twitch-aim contests.    Saying, ""But there was an alert"" is no defence when the alert is 3 minutes old and people are already pouring full-cheese overpop into single point bases."
PS2Cobalt,35zckw,Lapfinou,-2,Thu May 14 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"But I completely agree with you. The zergers like us are fat ugly people without soul, goblins which should be humiliated.  Blame is on us, even if most of the alerts are 33/33/33, if there is an overpop somewhere, it's necessarily that the PL summoned more zerglings. Yes, we are satanists too, shame on us.  And sorry, next time, we will set up a system in which, for all the platoons, only one player is sent each minute, so that the pop raises slowly.  Please humiliate us more, it's cheap and easy, no need to think deeper because you have the almighty Knowledge in a second without even leading open platoons regularly.  Or you can get that sometimes, when a platoon leader in another faction makes a derp move and attack the third faction, we have a free platoon in our hands with which we have no ideas what to do."

I know what the MB1 is doing, and what the other NC outfits are doing, because I am actually regularly in the command channel, in contrary to most of those dumb critics.  We are doing what has to be done to win the alerts. If there are stupid PL on VS/TR attacking each other while NC is winning, fault is on them.  On another hand, if PL actually began to always attack the winning faction during an alert and redeploy when required, we would end in a MillerVSBriggsVSCobalt SS position leading to 33/33/33 territory where skill matters.  But no, let's have the most haughty speech and ask people to not go for alerts because honorabru code or whatever, and go against the playerbase because they obviously know better than them what playerbase wants."

It can be you or w/e PL it was for not interpreting the map better and/or not splitting your forces fast enough. Or Creagle because he wants fair fights not too big in a game that promotes and let you do completely freely the opposite. Or SOE/DBG for the lack of clear meta, the lack of strategic depth, the redeployside...  What I see is that everyone is complaining. Both are discussing on how to have better gaming experience in PS2. It is a constant debate between 2 or 3 sides.  But no side is hearing the other one. Everyone is deaf and not wanting to see improvements where there are or not trying to work hand in hand for better experience when there is room for improvements. The game is now ""who will i have the leisure to blame today ?"".  To me, the real PS2 cancer is MAXes more than any zerg. You can avoid zergs and horrible 96+ for few minutes. But you can't avoid those infantry fight fun killers very long. They are no brainers on the tactical level. And they are everywhere and even on 1-12 bases.  But I do see some improvements and can't await for more."

I could go into more detail as to why but its something I've already covered a long long time ago on ye olde ceres reddit.  One thing I'd like to add though is that you did the right thing, if you aren't enjoying a game just log out. The game keeps on going. The games two years old and say if it was battlefield they'd have released a 2nd or 3rd version in that time, and were still getting queue's in prime time of up to 30.  I like what the pandamonium guy said ""you should stop trying to play a massively multiplayer game alone...If you're in a platoon where the Platoon Lead actually knows what he's doing, and driving good content, then life's peachy.""

PS2Cobalt,35xg60,KratosPrimus,1 point,Fri May 15 11:29:53 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why people always combine the hex system with the ressources system. Yes it was different back then and bases gave ressources. But it has nothing to do with the capture system. There was a long time where we had the old ressource system and the lattice system. Sorry to burst that out onto you but I heard this several times now especially in the past. Also I agree with you. It just always confused me why people always bring and brought up the ressource system when they talk about the capture system even though they can be handled totally independent.
PS2Cobalt,35xg60,KratosPrimus,1 point,Fri May 15 11:49:15 2015 UTC,"exactly they should be handled independently, but now there is only one system in the game for both and it does not work out so good. So the fix is obvious and has to be pointed out: Hex for capture, lattice for resources. You cannot fix one without adressing the other because both are connected gameplaywise. (also resource lattice for a spawnsystem were you cannot redeploy over the whole map but only on your lane)"
PS2Cobalt,35xg60,KratosPrimus,1 point,Fri May 15 11:58:55 2015 UTC,You have the nanites. They don't have anything to do with the lattice system. And neither did the old ressources with the hex system. They are both different gameplay aspects that affect the whole game. But having the hex system does not equal to having bases give ressources.
PS2Cobalt,35xg60,KratosPrimus,1 point,Fri May 15 12:06:05 2015 UTC,"You are right i just want to point out that you should mention a lattice based ressource system (like this ant transport thing) when you talk about a hexcapture system, because the main point against hex was that it does not encourage making a stance against the enemy force, but capturing around it by doing the ying and yang.  The force funneling aim of a latticecap system can instead be adopted by a lattice based ressource system.  So in the end you have the freedom to cap any base around you, but sooner or later you will have to make a stance at the bases your ressources are running trough.   By mentioning this you can take away the main negative point of a hex system."
PS2Cobalt,35xg60,KratosPrimus,2,Fri May 15 13:42:16 2015 UTC,Oh now I think I get it. You mean lattice links = ressources ? That actually sounds pretty awesome! That makes so much sense :D

PS2Cobalt,35vkez,Ometen,3,Thu May 14 09:24:00 2015 UTC,I disagree. You lost the alert to NC.   Nobody gave bases without a fight and nobody lost bases without a fight either. It's the nature of three way battle and even if one faction steals a base from you in last minute putting you in second place it doesn't mean that two last hours of alert the faction you lost to did nothing at all.
PS2Cobalt,35uhss,POPCORNpr0,2,Wed May 13 16:48:29 2015 UTC,I'm signing up for it. I could help you to capture footage for example if you need an NC to shoot at. I don't have experience with writing scripts but I've writen a whole book so writing in general is not a problem. I could also discuss certain basics or refer you to more experienced players from the Jesters. Send me a PM with what you need and I will send you further contact details.

Video of 2-3 min about just 1 turret is bad to short you need to make a lot of videos like that better make 10-15 min video for engineer class. You need some neutral but hardcore music not from the game and not from your other videos. I think its bad to talk about things like statistics for every weapon out there, we can all see that, but teach them  what pump-shotgun is whats ROF, muzzle velocity etc.  I suggest you get specialist to help whit different videos. Like Gylle with HA, Rene with LA Daikar and KillalIluminati with esf, fuzzy with smg,  Tamran84 is back in the game definitely for battle sundys, Toby for sq/pl leading, galaxykiller how to troll and not play game at all making people angry at you,  and you can do video on maxes :p.

It's difficult to know where to start in this game but I can offer you a few topics which I think new players really struggle with.   The capture mechanics and lattice. The spawning system - it's very different from cod and bf and definitely puts ppl off ps2.  I almost quit in beta because it felt like i spent all my time running between bases. Something that really explains the role of infiltrators.  Too many new players join and try to play sniper like cod, unless you are a 360mlgnoscope type, cqc sniping in this game is really difficult to pull off, and even then you need a squad I think.  I also see too many new players playing stalker infils and too many do not appreciate the power of their spotter and darts. Fps basics, like peeking, recoil control, and a mention of burst firing, which requires shorter bursts in ps2 than maybe bf.  Also minimap usage, including a tip on how to zoom it in and enlarge. Explain that the default guns are very competitive all rounders and that unlocked weapons are generally side grades.  With the exception of the gauss saw, vehicle guns, and aircraft, unlocks other than an optic and maybe foregrip are not early priorities. Explain that BR is not as important as real experience.  A higher br player is not killing them because they have more certs, 9 times out of 10.  Point to rerolled characters as proof. Explain how to redeploy. Explain how good medkits are. Explain that public platoons are not always the best environment for a new player.  They can be but it is hit or miss quite often.  Explain that is because some are just not led properly, and even when they are, because it is public, the leadership can get brutal.  They also tend to zerg more. Explain the effects of zergs and how to read the map in order to assess which zergs you want to avoid, or take on, and which may be necessary to take a base.  Perhaps too complex a topic, but certainly make the point that if you are finding yourself bored by capping bases with no opposition, or by being base camped you're probably at the wrong base or with the wrong group.  And to further that point, explain that many different groups play the game in very different ways, and that by contacting people via the outfit recruitment in game, joining reddit, and even posting on ps2mentor reddit, they might find what they are looking for.  The point is though that they need to shop around.   Anyway that's just a few ideas off the top of my head, but I'll give you more if I can, and if you need any help explaining any specifics on what I mean feel free to ask.  Good luck with it anyway."

I think they had 10 people in total and the rest of the 3 and half squads were randoms.  They took a fucking techplant on amerish with 70% NC. Not defending. They attacked the base, set themselves up by blocking the side entrances with sunderers and ai harrassers on the point. Their commander sounded like Schwarzenegger yelling ""come oan, ged to da wayboints!"" all while NC tried maxcrashing and sunderer rushing.  It was mental.

PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,FuzzBuket,2,Wed May 13 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"gonna be blunt, i dont mean anything bad and i do think your a fantastic leader, BUT.  cobalts issue is declining quality of play, mass migration of outfits and air.  we won previous seversmashes with great infantry, but fantastic air dominance. now air aint the current meta; and we dont have the pilots we had a year ago.  but we are still focusing on air very hard; and are mainly (except from the burster squad and valks) using stale tactics.  i dont want to be the bearer of bad news; but if you play emerald or briggs at infantry redeployside they will win. its how they constantly play on live; and after having the (mis)fortune of running into a few hive on a playtest, and even outfits like [TIW]*, [DA] and the likes im going to say cobalt doesnt have that.  imo we should stop focusing on playing them at their game, and stop focusing on beauracracy, and focus on co-ordination and new and intresting tactics. other teams prep for redeployside, and other servers have worse cases of it than ours, so they know it better.    TL:DR if  mike tyson said hed play me at a sport, id rather run a 10k against him than box him."
PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,BlckJck103,5,Wed May 13 00:42:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything in that post that is contradictory to what we're hoping to do.   The entire point of rebuilding the council is to move the team forward, an acknowledgement that winning isn't achievable in the current situation. Xaniy and Omnishoot haven't been involved in Smash as long as the others so they bring in a fresh opinion. We've got stuff like the the Faction coordinators and TRID's monthly Ops and hopefully more as we go. Our job, more than anything else, is to work on finding these new tactics, and working with outfits to make sure they all know what to be working on.  Obviously don't expect us to release an entire roadmap on the public reddit but don't see this as simply, ""Well we'll get some PLs and do the same shit again and again"".  Simply put, if this wasn't a serious attempt to build a tournament winning team I wouldn't have come back to the game to help.   You say we shouldn't have this bureaucracy but you can't do this without some people managing it. You can't expect 20+ outfits across 3 factions and 3/4 languages to all pull in the same direction without any management. And you can't expect a team to compete with the other servers without long-term effort.  TL:DR if you challenge Mike Tyson to a 10k you better have been practicing your long distance running and know you're good at it before you get to the start line."

PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,BlckJck103,3,Wed May 13 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah and that will always be a problem of making sure that everything is focused and not getting bogged down in minutiae. We've still got reps to manage the sign-ups and spreadsheets and meetings etc.  We've also got Halo, who unlike the other 5 who are responsible for training, is focused on making sure we're improving the team and not distracted by any other shit that might come up.

PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,KaiserWodka,2,Wed May 13 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"I try to understand our opponents game and steal from it what I can but I hope that we will always play our own game and build on our strengths as well as our weaknesses.  The quality of play on Cobalt isn't declining, it has declined.  It happened quite a few months ago now and then stabilised with just a minimal amount of tactical outfit play and almost zero quality platoon play.  If anything, it's been getting very slightly better lately.  This decline on Live is a key cause of our decline in Smash.  Yes, many of us know how to turn it on for a Smash, but lacking that practice and squad discipline and losing that edge in leadership, it has hurt us.  We've lost some quality outfits and players too but I think Blckjck being back and the recent commitments from DBG will help to bring some back.  Mending this will take weeks and not months, and that's why my role on the Council is to try and keep this thing moving forward so that it doesn't fade away again.  We have the time now, we just need to make sure that we use it.  I've played with TIW and I know how good they are.  We have lacked full squads of that kind of quality lately.  However, we have a few outfits that have the potential to get to that level and I'm hoping that with some prodding, they will be ready to step up their game.    Also, although we lack outfits like that, we can form a force without anything half as awful as the lower end outfits that Emerald fields.  We can average out a force that can give them a reasonable game now.  If we work hard and they get casual in their dominance, then in a few months time we will be back in our position as underdogs ready to show them something new again."

Cobalt has been good to me (although a lot of hard work too :P.)   I don't like the word bureaucracy with all its negative connotations.  Realistically, what are you going to achieve with 240 disparate gamers without some sort of structure / organisation / framework?  This isn't about structuring our force and setting up comms etc anyway;  We've got all kinds of options in that regard and frankly, it's much less important.  This is about getting our squads and platoons to play better, to train more often and to fight each other (rather than the randoms) so that they get some real competition.    If we can drive that forward, using our more experienced and proven leaders to provide advice and guidance, it will lead to us developing stronger squad play and more creative and competitive leaders.  Regardless of our Smash systems and structures, that will lead to wins.  We've got lots of plans and I want to feed it through onto reddit bit-by-bit to try and retain people's interest and not just overload them with stuff.  I want to build on our strengths as well as our weaknesses.    I'm going to try and make as much of this public as we can possibly afford to do, regardless of what other servers may see.  Ultimately I can't make the server better and neither can this Council.  We need the players and outfits involved to buy-in to what we want to achieve and to make it happen.  We're going to be more open in regards to Smash things than other servers and make that into a strength of ours (I bet Blckjck is cringing as he reads this :P.)"

(assuming anything actually happens)   Does that mean we cannot actually plan for the meta? Because that is really interesting.   Not that training is a mistake, it doesn't matter what the meta is if you can't shoot straight or work as a team."
PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,Marthalion,1 point,Wed May 13 09:17:41 2015 UTC,You can still use patch notes & PTS to see what the changes will be. Every server's in the same boat and has to try and predict the changes.  A big mistake we made in the last tournament is that we went into the tournament without thinking about all the changes the resource revamp caused.
PS2Cobalt,35r1dh,Kelpitorgh,2,Wed May 13 09:30:26 2015 UTC,"Super excite though! I think its really cool, because tactics could really emerge as a result of changes, like hard counters or get around's for things like redeployment.

PS2Cobalt,35tdf0,pintle,1 point,Wed May 13 11:18:43 2015 UTC,"face up to the fact, that only YOU can make this game a great experience for everyone involved.   Do you lead open groups often?  Because if you don't, I am inclined to suggest that you practice what you preach.  Do not assume anything from the random people that have downloaded this f2pmmo. If you do not support and enable them in playing in ""the correct way"", as you see it, you cannot claim legitimate surprise or disappointment when that doesn't happen.  Question: Say I solo in a NAR/FS/Needler/Lolpods mozzy.   If you accept that I generally check the map and look for an offensive fight (Where, compared to a defence, the risk of spawnroom burstards is way higher, and the presence of enemy vehicles to kill way less likely = worse ""farm""), and basically try to PTFO from my solo ESF (as opposed to roaming around seal clubbing), am I a terribru person that is killing the game? I mean I am still basically A2G ""farming"" solo.  Honestly I think (on live) once you ""git gud"" to a certain level, at a certain scale, in this game, the hardest part of it all is reconciling the tryhards/casuals (no hate just shorthand terms) and balancing fun vs ""winning""."
PS2Cobalt,35tdf0,pintle,1 point,Wed May 13 11:02:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I certainly haven't lead as much as you...  Regarding your question: An A2G mossie giving close air support is potentially helpful. A squad of ""solo"" mossies, listening to an active command chat to hear where they are needed most, is invaluable.  If you don't need that, fine. But most mossies I see dicking about, would shell a friendly sunderer to get one kill on a hostile infiltrator or stick to a zerged base, waiting 3 minutes for the last camper to run out."

PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,jarree,1 point,Tue May 12 15:17:29 2015 UTC,This is just awesome on so many ways. Maybe this will reduce the maxspam. And also just imagine towerfights or battles in small areas. This will be so great if you can simply kill multiple maxes running up the stairs or maxcrash the generator room with  tankmines.
PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,Nemasirex,1 point,Tue May 12 15:45:22 2015 UTC,Good idea apart from the fact this would punish engineers with non maxed tool. If they wanted to do this then they would have to give defuse to all levels of engineer.

PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,Nemasirex,1 point,Tue May 12 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good idea. It will present more reasons to play engineer when in a squad making them more than just a turret and ammo bot, as well as discouraging the people that just pull MAXes in all fights in an attempt to farm.  On the other hand it probably won't make much difference to organised squads as they will be able to get the mines EMP'd or otherwise destroyed before the MAXes charge in. So basically this change promotes using MAXes carefully in a team rather than the current casual pulling.  (On a side note I'd like AV nades to be less glitchy and horrible to use, they got a deserved nerf but at the moment they are just shite)"

PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Tue May 12 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"As much as I like this in theory I smell a fish as well, because this is almost too much of a nerf for them.  These are normally accompanied by big IFs, such as perhaps the resistance to mines being lowered on maxes, so it may be they'll not go far enough in order to keep the skill suit enthusiasts happy."
PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,Aloysyus,1 point,Tue May 12 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Maxes are the universal-versatile ""i can do it all"" counter against infantry, vehicles and air units. They can be revived, they can switch weapons. In infantry fights the only real counters are Rockets, AV nades, c4 and other Maxes.  Infantry runs into prox mines all the time, tanks get instagibbed by tankmines, air can get one-shot by tanks and daltons and gets a lot of lock-ons/flak.   So maxes shouldn't die to tank mines? It's not like they can't run EOD HUD."
PS2Cobalt,35pkkl,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Tue May 12 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"That's not what I was saying.  I just think we should tailor our expectations a bit here because we probably all imagine mines will be one shot kills on them.  Given the amount of them you can spam with utility belt, I wouldn't be surprised to see a gentle introduction for Max players or a dramatic ""rebalance"" following the uproar from scrubs who just play Max."

It would be amazing if some buildings would disallow maxes to enter the rooms or something, making their texture bigger or door frame smaller, max spam is real nowadays.  The only thing I would accept with hands wide open would be kind of ""arenas"" like they were in World of Warcraft of ""battlefields"", where random 12vs12 people would log in and you would fight each other infantry only, that would be amazing, altho I agree that it would destroy the game concept, but the game is barely playable atm., not for longer terms.

Dalton Montages are boring for me as well - i'd prefer mixed gameplay videos with some Dalton shots in it.  You max video however was a parody and had it's moments but you stretched the joke so much that i just ended up with watching at random kills... Some teamspeak coversations are pretty funny but it's rare that i really laugh listening to some in a YT video.

Most people on this reddit plays Planetside to a degree of seriousity. Being a casual in other games is not a bad thing. I am a (former) LoL player myself and I do concede that it is a game catering more to the casual crowd than games like dota 2 or HoN.

PS2Cobalt,35gjjq,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 10 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that. We had a few pilots from Jest. When we first spoke to them afterward I could tell by their voice that you guys had not had the best experience up in the air. I mean, we weren't oblivious to how much they had, we had to try and fly aerial spawns through it.  But what you did do was an amazing job with what you had, and that in turn secured a Cobalt victory. Reddit can be quick sometimes to jump on the pilots whenever they did well. Well I think it is fair that when you did a job in very difficult circumstances you werent going to cover yourself in glory. Just wanted to let you know that your contributions were really appreciated on the ground. The few times I asked for help you guys turned up with what I needed at the right time for gal removal, cap enforcement. I actually felt you guys as much in this smash as I have when we have had twice the pilots. In turn there was a bit more Ground based AA. Maybe not enough yet, and in the right areas, but that is something to be worked on.  So yeah, sorry it was a more rage inducing experience, but your sacrifice was greatly appreciated, both personally and as a group"

PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Slippyfist69,6,Sun May 10 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"Well, thank you Derpster for leading our platoon and for giving GBX a chance to participate. And of course for everyone else in our platoon (RE4+F1S7) as well as the 190 people counting on us. Great match. My unexpirenced smash-squad (most of the m8s did it for the first time) did well in the training, but the stress in the smash got a little impact on our performance, i see a lot of potential to develop. At the end we felt needed and having great fun. Hope my team gets picked again to show our improvements. Even if that was a stunning win, everyone should seek for optimization, yesterday we just brought cobalt back on track - its still a long way to the title.   My perspective of view from platoon no. 1:  Their air dominance was a thing that hurt us the most around the northern lane. Billions of Reavers were spawed, galaxies hanging above us for ages. After the Crystal Ridge cap, we swaped to double walker sundys what was a decent call. Sometimes, we just stopped the sundys and changed to lockon heavys/burstermax far outside the base to kill their air targets hanging above F1S7, already on point. At the base, I missed our sunderer protection a bit. Often, we pulled half of the squad back to grab haraessers and lightnigs to take out the vanguards shooting our garage sundys. Half of these vehicle get then farmed by air, the other half took the thread out, getting farmed by air later. Infantry play was very fine, we got only breakouts, very few point-breaches. Sundy-destruction by air and tanks is what made us lose the points most of the time. And /squad promoteme was somehow really buggy. The calls for defence came very early, on the most bases we defended we got more than 2,5 mins to safe the point, so we primed their sunderers and make their galaxies go away, before we pushed a medic ball to the point. The early calls was very good and we defended every bases we were called on.  So was this good? I clearly felt the dedication of the cobalt smash force to the objective in every move we made. Our organization was a bit chaotic in stressful situations, our mlg-kd was under average, but xp-gaining was fine, also coordination between the squads worked better than in the trainings. When we just got a some time to organize we pulled off some nice tactics. So yeah, we got a good platoon i would say, but i think we can do better.  I wont/cant judge about things outside my point of view, but im sure the rest of the cobaltians did good as well, and i will read your reviews.  When im looking at the Connery guys, i missed their objective play/awareness a lot.  At some point i was standing in the garage, nearly all of my squad repairing the only left sunderer, waiting for RE4 and F1S7 to push a point, which gets hammerd by air and by two connery farming sunderers deployed next to the garage. The guys pushed out all of the time and died, but Connery was not pushing in. The timer went down, and i thought okay, fuck it, lets fall back and get defences up, but Connery wasnt moving at all. Sometimes 1-2 reavers dropped infiltrators on the previous base, but it was quickly dealt with them. After we adopted to their air dominance, their galaxies had a hard time staying above the points. Then we just pulled of some new walker sundys, make them go away and denied their galaxy to approach the base, ghostcapped the point on next base and start moving with the rest of the squads. Most of the time, we found more vanguards/lightnings tring to stop our sundys, then their sunderers pushing. Maybe Connery-FC just ordered to stall the north instead of attacking - in the interview he said that he was focused on the middle. (which isnt the best stragety for the esamir map at least on live) The bases that were really under attack by Connery, and which we safed very late (>0:30s) with help of other platoons, mostly got at least one nc-sunderer deployed. Looks like the guys from Connery prefered ""drop and hold"" instead of hardspawns, which was the better solution for my squad. Valks and Gals just got downed too fast by their air.   So, tl;dr:   Cobalt played for territory, constantly pushing on all lanes, no matter what numbers on the lane. Cobalt played very agressively and prefered solid attacks over wonky point holds. Connery failed on stalling lanes and defending inbetween two bases. Connery dedicated way more players to their air force, using a lot of galaxies, but AA did the job.   The concept of clear separation between good and bad is only existent in the church. Reality is diffrent.  We got multiple awnsers to every situation from good to bad outfits. Everyone was doing their part with the tools they can use best. This mix of fighters and the right distribution of forces depending on their capabilities by our FC and PLs is what made us win.  So i want to encourage everyone to look for things to optimize in their yards. Keep training, keep cooperating. Thanks for last night, Cobalt."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,zedcom,2,Sun May 10 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"but the stress in the smash got a little impact on our performance, i see a lot of potential to develop.   Same with us, it was only towards the end that we loosened up a bit.  We were redeploying a lot during the first half of the match and for a while we were just being annoying at snowshear with one squad.   At some point i was standing in the garage, nearly all of my squad repairing the only left sunderer, waiting for RE4 and F1S7 to push a point, which gets hammerd by air and by two connery farming sunderers deployed next to the garage.   Yep we were being farmed too at some point but heres something I posted on the Connery reddit...  ""I've seen a lot of mention about K/D here, and yeah sure getting a high KD is one thing but there are many other variables that can help with the over all match... such as dying. I was squad leading and ordered my squad to spawn on a sunderer that was basically surrounded by enemy infantry, being pounded by air and tanks. I told my squad to keep that sunderer alive for as long as possible, let the opponent 'farm' us. We were outnumbered, we were tying down twice our numbers, which to me means you're under popped elsewhere. It's a sucky situation to be that fish in the barrel but you need to think about the bigger picture. Out popping a base makes opportunities for the opponent, people get into a farm frenzy and you keep them distracted.""  One point I ordered my squad to keep that single sunderer alive and to just get farmed, on live I would have probably destroyed that sunderer myself or redeployed the hell outta there.  and the /squad promoteme is an awesome feature, only problem was it didn't work 70-80% of the time.  10/10 would smash with GBX again."

PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Squiggelz,2,Sun May 10 10:52:29 2015 UTC,"My POV is that the Connery air was numerous but ineffective, we took out an absolutely rude amount of air at the traverse with a single squad of G2A lockons and a walker Sundy and it took them 10 minutes to realise what was going on. Even then it was the ""ground"" platoon that came after us with a Gal and the Reavers remained oblivious.    Added to this, their ground pushes were not dynamic. They didn't pull Sunderers in any numbers, often failed to protect their deployed ones and spent a lot on MAX suits which they then had to transport or waste when we moved elsewhere.    By the second half they had some Vanguards roaming around and their air was problematic when moving from base to base but we counteracted this by doing stuff like pulling a harasser and then using beacons to just get indoors."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,MyCreagle,2,Sun May 10 07:58:24 2015 UTC,"I was rather confused as to what you were doing at The Traverse when I was getting pounded by lasher fire on the point from that little camp site you guys had set up out there, that was until I saw the lockons and lancer fire when they started rolling sundies and air in. The latter was very much appreciated and the amount of nanites you guys cost them far outweighed the amount we spent at that stage of the fight."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,elbifo,2,Sun May 10 09:09:36 2015 UTC,Yeah we got a bit carried away with the Lashers but they had almost 2 squads moving up the bridge that we thinned down to 4 or 5 guys by the time they hit A. I think one of our lads has a cap of the Lancer spam we had going and tbh it felt mean.
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,jarree,1 point,Sun May 10 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"yep they relied too much on their air squad ( maybe like we did before) but here they weren't coordonate properly with their infantry, so most of the kill the reaver did were useless, as people could respawn in peace"
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Ethnicbadger,1 point,Sun May 10 08:22:08 2015 UTC,Admin on twitch chat said their air is mostly japanese players. From the stream it looked like they just hovered around clueless most of the time. Maybe some communication issues?
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,angehbabe,0,Sun May 10 08:39:42 2015 UTC,"their air is mostly japanese players.   I think this is untrue, not one single aircraft carrier was destroyed or put out of action. Their Ohka's looked more like reavers too."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Aveik,2,Mon May 11 03:37:25 2015 UTC,"From the point of view of a ground shitter in Jest;  The match felt more 'complete' for want of a better word. Command was clear, orders made sense and the movement was fluid. Everytime something major was going on in the North PL2 smashed into the southern amp station to pull forces or hit Octagon, constantly forcing Connery to over-commit resources to where they didn't need it.  I saw a lot of good feints with us dumping pop on a base, waiting for the redeploy and then us just redeploying out to the intended target leaving Connery confused and buying us a couple of mins on the other cap. I'd be intrigued to hear command comms but it certainly felt that during the last 40min Cobalt had sussed out the Connery force command and knew how to pressure them to over-commit or lead them down a blind alley.  Overall the communication was good, not only in platoon but across platoons. When supporting other platoons proximity was used well to co-ordinate defence between platoons/squads outwith the command chain. I don't ever remember this being trained but it just kinda happened and it worked very well.   I do think it'd be good to take this force structure and try run against Emerald though - any chance a server rep (looking at you Angeh) could investigate if this is possible?"

PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,halospud,2,Sun May 10 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"Octagon cap was so late I don't think anyone really cared about it, we cedrtainly were there to spam MAXes and proxy chat and make sure we don't lose our image as the premier MAXSHOTGUNSHITTERFISTZERG on Cobalt.  They tried to get bases in north and south while the cap went through, but all the pop was on Octagon and we contested the caps easily long enough to run out the clock of the match."

PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,NerfDragonhawks,1 point,Sun May 10 05:35:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I was surprised we took freyr amp and crystal ridge so easily. We did however experience their air dominance in and around snowshear watchtower for a bit.
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,NerfDragonhawks,3,Sun May 10 01:48:08 2015 UTC,"It was the weirdest Smash I ever played in simply because I don't remember having been fighting on a capture point much at all.  They had zero squad cohesion and were all strung out in 1s and 2s that didn't seem to be trying to get points back.  I remember when we were harassing EMC, I saw a ton of MAXs and infantry gathering in the spawn and then charging out of the spawn, so I called the MAX crash.  Then they all split up and went in different directions, most of which didn't make any sense, and we picked them off one-by-one.  Everyone was like ""What MAX crash?  I don't see a MAX crash.""  That was maybe 7k nanites pissed up the wall.  In general their nanite conservation was non-existent.  They would pull vanguards for a job that a battle bus could do much better and they'd pull MAXs in fights where they didn't have the numbers to stand a chance anyway.  They had a tendency to deploy into base defences pretty late, which certainly made life easier.  The air was annoying, but it wasn't effective in taking out our spawns and it was pretty easy to shoot down.  It also seemed to move in a big blob most of the time, so it seemed like you had a billion reavers above you or none at all.  The guys with the SOLs tag seemed like pretty good infantry players, though their platoon was in disarray.  Didn't notice any other tags killing me.  In terms of the quality of infantry 1v1 play, they had a few exceptional players but the average was very low.  We may have been good but I really couldn't say because we were never tested.  I'm a bit disappointed because I thought Connery were up for this but they played terribly."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Kelpitorgh,4,Sun May 10 11:13:35 2015 UTC,"and to everyone, Did we win because we were ""Good"" or because Connery were ""Bad""? bearing in mind we lost the previous two Smashes so badly against Miller and Emerald.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfgHVSvxZUA"

PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Sovano1,1 point,Sun May 10 09:47:08 2015 UTC,"Connery certainly was bad, from my POV, assigned at Waterson Redemption the whole match and if necessary at the defense of Echo Valley.  Our 3 squad platoon should not have had a single chance against their air platoon + ground full platoon. But we managed to aspire their forces on Waterson. Moreover, despite the times when we had no point on Waterson and the timer was off, they had only 1 time the idea to drop on Echo Valley, which we defended so easily.  I've seen no battlebus trains, no massive force multipliers different than air. No sundys in bases (oh yeah 1 time at Echo Valley, I shot one down). But I think they really had plenty of resources. My squad (support) litterally had NONE during the entire match.  Don't expect to see that performance for the next smashes. The fights will be far more difficult."
PS2Cobalt,35g4nb,Rangerdanvers,1 point,Sun May 10 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"They had 3% less pop then us, like we had versus Miller. Not like Connery would had won tho, but we should had beaten Miller.  We are pretty good, but connery infantry gameplay is some of the worst i seen in any smash, not trying to be rude.  Emerlad not much we could have done against them they are very good but no one can beat them when they can kill ppl before they show up around corners, did not have that problem against connery.  The Miller smash we really shoud had won, no ide what happend maybe it was our low pop that screwed us over who knows.   And briggs i think we will win. So yes we r good."

(us and them)  Also from how it looked in the opening the Connery air force  was easily 5 Squads plus. So that would have given us a ground advantage.  So not sure, but a good question that needs asking"

PS2Cobalt,35bgt0,Aloysyus,1 point,Sat May 9 13:49:28 2015 UTC,It depends on whether you put it on a Harasser or a Tank. This is not a coincidence.
PS2Cobalt,35bgt0,Aloysyus,1 point,Sat May 9 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well I've had several competent gunners riding with me on both guns, all have agreed that the Saron is superior on the Harasser, it's anecdotal I know, but it's not irrelevant. The only thing the Vulcan is truly superior at is killing infantry.  PS: Stop using biased stats, raw kills is a bad indicator for something being OP as it might simply be pulled more frequently, instead you should be using Kills Per Unit like it's shown here. Alternatively you can use Kills Per Hour which will also give a more accurate picture than raw kills ever could."

The biggest problem here is imho the clip size, not so much the weapon mechanic itself.  KPU is also biased: If a faction spawns a weapon so much less it means that's usually the ""better"" players do it. If you and me spawn an enforcer harasser for the lolz we will have an above average outcome. But Vulcan? They are just everywhere."

I think farming resources will need more effort then just clicking the ore, imagine having to push up to the mine with an armor collum protecting the sundie mining it and then having to drive it back to a safe zone. Once you have mined it the enemy will be alerted and will come after you to try and steal it for themselfs.   That sounds like fun to me atleast.  Outfits already go to PTS and jaeger to practice and scrim so why would it be bad to actually make that easy and an actual game mode in game? I know I will use it to do 12v12 air battles and its something I have wanted in game for a very long time.

I'm guessing the new game mode will use the nexus or something along the lines of that and be a TDM mode, because that's toasty what outfits want >.> I highly doubt it but I hope they do something like the new Robocraft mode or 2142 titan mode, they're cool    Resource gathering could lead to some awesome on the road\MadMax battles if done by the players right, little convoy going with AA, repair sundies and AV, it would create mini vehicles objectives.  For the Resources to be worth it though base power drain needs to have significant impacts or I mean what's the point in doing it  If we get Flash and Harasser Resource gather attachments, I guess I'd be doing that a lot     Base benefits would be cool if some outposts gave certain abilities that Outfit leaders\high rankers could use with a Outfit wide and personal cool down, something like the ChronoSphere from C&C would be nifty, bases that allow whichever outfit that capped it to create a temporary lattice link from that base to another adjoining one, bases that allows Outfits to control infantry spawning flow, if spawns will use bases nanites up. For example you cap a little base that can spawn vehicles, the outfit would restrict how many people could spawn at that base so more nanites can be used to pull vehicles, there could even be a super vehicle that takes nearly a whole bases power supply to pull.    The main thing I think would make bases more desirable, is the ability to mod the base, an outfit caps it, allow the outfit lead/higher ups to put up extra defences, take down certain walls, close and open doors, move points about, add more points, all of which would effect the bases power consumption in some way and would require several truck loads of nanites to switch stuff up.

PS2Cobalt,358som,Diskriminator,4,Fri May 8 10:09:40 2015 UTC,"The only one that really makes sense is engineer. Think about it, in most games (like Battlefield) it's not the ""heavy"" that has antivehicle weaponry like rockets, but the engineer has them. If the engi had rockets in ps2 I think classes would be way more balanced. Givin the engi a antivehicle weapon and most important something that gives people a new insentive to the class would be the most logical thing. I am really, REALLY hopin this is for the engineer and not for the ClickF(uckYou)Assault."

Dont get me wrong, I would also love to see it on any other class except HA and MAX...but I'm afraid it wont happend..."
PS2Cobalt,358som,Diskriminator,2,Fri May 8 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"The engi is the weakest class in infantry combat and everybody is playing engi almost only in vehicles. So imo they should give the engi this tool, which OP posted AND the normal rocket launcher instead of the heavy. Make the HA shield a only frontal shield and remove that the shield is usuable against headshots, that would be balanced imo. Same applies to the vanguard shield, except the headshots thing ofc :P"
PS2Cobalt,358som,Punisher_Ps2,1 point,Fri May 8 12:58:51 2015 UTC,"Ludders wouldnt agree with you its the weakest, lol. I love playing Engi myself, so versatile. 4 Stickies, bunch of all kinds of mines (with ability to take even more), infantry suppresing turret, awsome AV turret, that Sundy guard auto turret, infinte ammo, with combination of grenade launcher (miss the old OP days), fastest EXP collector, MAXes and rocket primary scrubs loving you...so, pretty much equiped for everything in right hands.   But yeah, Engi rly miss some special ability, that F for ammo sucks, lol. I would like to have some better ability instead of new weird weapon, but okay, w/e its cool, plus if its not for HA/MAX, its even more cool.  Also, agree with shields."

PS2Cobalt,358som,Spartancfos,2,Fri May 8 11:30:28 2015 UTC,"I mean I am a tanker, the reason I complain is the RAVEN max is basically unkillable at its kill range. It can strafe my tankshells and can also take 3 or 4 hits without dying. The Engi Turret isn't really an issue, you can kill it easily enough. A low damage to vehicles, but high damage to MAX's tank rifle would be immense, and actually give a decent role to the Infiltrator as a sniper. Because snipers are basically pointless except to stop turrets."

PS2Cobalt,358ig0,Chuckys2,1 point,Fri May 8 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"Makes sense when you say it like that, what about the shields? Why adrenaline so much? Everyone goes for adrenaline but I heard one of the shields lowers damage on headshots, resist shield I think? Why not that one?"
PS2Cobalt,358ig0,Chuckys2,1 point,Fri May 8 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to how the shields have to be used to maximise their effectiveness. Adrenaline and NMG are used reactionary. You turn them on when you get shot as they outright block damage affecting your normal health and shield. In order for resist to be used effectively you have to activate it before you get shot at, which is very hard to do and also not that advantageous as you move slower with your shield up. Resist can block more damage from headshots yes, and this means it can take more headshots to kill, but overall you have less effective health than with adrenaline. And as for why choose adrenaline over NMG? It recharges when you get a kill, so you are more likely to be able to go 1v2 or 1v3 if you get health after each kill.  However this is all personal preference and observation. Try out both adrenaline and resist and pick whichever you like."

Consider the reason why someone would do this.  Advertise a working product - unlikely to work for long if advertised widely.  Scam people into buying some exe file which at best doesn't work, but at worst installs various dodgy files.  Links to a website which does the same.  Even if ""evidence"" is provided with these things, i question why theyd give devs any clues which could be used to track down the exploit, and for that reason I'd conclude it is most likely an old hack which has been shut down already.  Once the exploit has been shut down there is every reason to be as revealing as possible in order reel in a few gullible types and squeeze some cash out of them or compromise their system to your own ends.

PS2Cobalt,354f2s,Ometen,0,Thu May 7 13:16:21 2015 UTC,What a waste of good footage :/   Personally i dont like the video.   -No Music  -No propper editing  -Title implies that you didnt want to make a great video anyway  -to long  Flying is good as always but that is not enough for an entertaining video IN MY OPINION.

A shitter is a term that is so mainstream that it has lost its meaning (if it even ever had one) and is now just used to qualify someone you consider worse than you at the game.  I don't support this term nor do I approve its definition (I use it and I kinda feel bad for it)  But to answer you, IMO a shitter is (talking about its original meaning) someone that is terribly bad at this game.

Had planned this as a different track using that whole speech then realized Waffle VFX had already used the Zack Emery one (and a damn good job it was too). Just didn't fit this track though but I wanted to try and use some of it somewhere. It's geared as a look in back in time so it seemed fitting to end with that sample.
PS2Cobalt,34r318,NihilCredo,1 point,Sun May 3 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"This looks really nice. How much of the soft lighting, depth of field, bloom etc. was achieved in-game (rather than in post), and could you share the tricks you used to do that? It reminds me a lot of ENB graphic mods."
PS2Cobalt,34r318,RihnoSRB,1 point,Mon May 4 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you for the comment :)  I have tried to keep everything as faithful to the game engine as possible. The last shot with the max at the end of the video is the only scene where I added an additional camera blur, everything else was down to colour treatment of original footage. This was done in Premiere Pro and for the night scenes, this was achieved by applying a Luma Curve treatment to lighten the scene, increase in over saturation to punch the colour back up a little and then I applied a Lumetri dream's colour preset (this gives all the brights a nice glow effect) and finally I applied a Lumetri Cinematic preset on top as a final tweak on light & dark levels.  As for the filming, all this was done by using the player cam and turning the overlays off in game. I then filmed this through x4 scope (this achieves the natural DOF & blur effect you are seeing in the video) and then making heavy use of jetpacks and looking out of mosi windows to get a variety of shots and angles :)"

But still 94% tk ratio after this reset (and there were at least 50 kills on this). He got banned from MB1 too.  By the way, I don't see the point to troll people (you can see the warnings in his chat) and then make a video about it on reddit. They were clearly making an event without annoying anyone else."

I already confirmed that, and if you want i can provide you with enough stuff to get me banned.   But i doubt i will get banned, because several members that are still in the ranks of bkne and which are not casual players or newbies are still teamkilling everyday on purpose.   And pls dont say i dont respect rules, i enforced rules in enough games and on enough servers that i know what i am talking about. But all that doesnt change the fact, that BKNE is the worse Outfit currently in ps2, and enough people can confirm that. A year ago it was an different story, but since the clan leader has banned everybody who isnt the same opinion as him, things have gotten worse.  If you want to make such a big deal out of banning someone who has less then 4 Hours play time in almost a year go ahead, like i sad i will help you. But the thing is, if you are so strict about enforcing rules how come you dont go as hard against active players as your going against me?  BKNE has been activly teamkilling vor almost 6 month no one bets an eye, i kill a few because of their teamkilling and Insults everybody loses their mind. (pun intended)"

I don't care what BKNE does but whatever it is, it gives you no reason to hunt them down, especially if you are in another outfit (MB1).

And like i sad early to i dont recall bein in MB1 in the 4 hours i played the last 8 month. Dont have a problem with them, just with the way they treat other people and the way they tk on command.

They are proud of having so many members, they do their salute thing every saturday, they have clan rules that sound like laws of a totalitarian system - and they don't even notice that. You have to be absolutely loyal, you can't have friends from other factions, you are a fucking indoctrinated peasant. I am not saying that how they handle their daily business is as bad as it sounds in the rules - i don't know - but i sure as hell would stay wide, wide away from an outfit that presents itself that way."

PS2Cobalt,34qjpe,FuzzBuket,2,Mon May 4 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the clarification but ""typical german""? Come on, we see this kind of behaviour everywhere. The rules and all that what led me to talk about political systems is usually something that you really have problems explaining in germany if it wasn't just for a gaming community. BKNE represents the state of mind of it's leader, he likes being a shepherd, a big brother, whatever you call it. But if you think outfits with dumb rules are a german thing... For me it is not so much the non-existent skill or ""dumb"" rules, it's the state of mind i see exposed here."

Yes, if it wasn't a gaming community enough people would kick your ass in germany for beeing a dictator, luckily. But the reglementation of everything through rules, beeing ""family friendly"" and ""anti cyber bullying"" seems pretty german to me. I was quite tired yesterday looking back I shouldn't have called them dumb rules, I should have called them restricitive and vague so that they can justify almost any action. I agree that you can see their state of mind in these rules, just seems to be typical german to me, they value comradeship very high and take themselves damn seriously."
PS2Cobalt,34qjpe,troj7c8,1 point,Tue May 5 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"This comradeship is not really a high value in germany - at least not above average. It's the opposite: Average people look at ""Burschenschaften"" (fraternities) or ""Schützenvereine"" (shooting clubs) very suspiciously.  This being in clubs, unions, churches, sects or whatever is a phenomenon that you see all over the world. Just look at the USA with all their sects, preachers, hypocrite religious people... They need their rituals, their view of the world even though they would know better.  Personally i never liked rules and rituals that are not necessary. it always sounds so military to me. For our outfit it's mostly common sense like ""be nice, don't teamkill"" and stuff. It is a game, nothing else."

Note that it is Jack linking in my thread to some PL13 and apperently your bro's doing it.  The only reason i linked the PL07 video was because it's amusing considering the conversation we were having in previous thread and how close to warpgate they were doing it.   Like i've stated before two guys or sunderers that statpad themselves some certs are barely on my radar as offense. They don't spoil my game that's for sure. By wasting time earning certs the hard way of making their gaming time into hours of actual boring work.  As i've commented on my video to a guy who was calling you out. He should contact the PL13 officers over this issue first. With regards of PL07. Don't know them, never on leader comms, never coordinating with anyone. They are completely unknown outfit on Cobad and thus not worth any actual subtlety that i'd grant to you guys or PL13 for that matter."
PS2Cobalt,34poqw,goranstoja,1 point,Sun May 3 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"I've seen that video and i know who they were exactly. And in consequence i gave them final warning. I don't eject people out of the outfit instantly, after that godmode bug when i threw up quite innocent guy. They now have final warning and told me they undertand their mistake(ofc with some sulking over ""If DBG inserted in game this is not a bad thing""). They didn't regard it as exploit at all, as it is harmless and doesn't affect others gameplay. I've accepted their words and i pass you their apology.  Yet there will more such videos with numerous outfits. I don't bother enough(as you said, it doesn't affect normal play) yet late in night i've seen such ""repair"" stations around warpgate. I hope soe fix it quickly and give some bans. At least i expect them to give solid statement about it.  PL07 is another polish outfit that we cooperate from time to time. They don't exploit nor cheat at any time and don't support such actions at all. Yet this bug is so harmless probably some members didn't regard it as exploit, just like my guys."

PS2Cobalt,34poqw,Nerfav,0,Sun May 3 20:06:35 2015 UTC,To be fair it isn't a big enough deal to kick people over. Different outfits different conduct. This guy from another prominent outfit did something and i grilled him for it pretty damn hard in game. Now he's a Jester. Go figure.  Some of the people who conduct in a shitty way can be really good members of community that just don't consider something as bad as someone else does.  This sunderer farm doesn't cost anyone anything and thus going all guns blazing and moralizing is hardly a good approach. Especially since you never know when someone from your own outfit might misstep.  Proof in case pilots don't mind tomcats or coyotes will obviously get less flak than once that do even if they never used them up till the incident when they had to. So it's best to keep things bit muddy in hopes to minimizing the damange when shit hits the fan. Trust me there is always some hero that will make sure to sully your good or bad name with his personal agenda.
PS2Cobalt,34poqw,Gotohellwithsmile,2,Sun May 3 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"So, let me get this straight... you're standing up for blatant exploiting here?  They'd be kicked so hard their ass wouldn't even touch the floor if they did this in my outfit."
PS2Cobalt,34poqw,killALLilluminati,0,Sun May 3 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"You need to make a distinction between type of exploiting going on.  I don't endorse it but neither would i go all out moralizing over it. It's not even close to wallhacks, aimbots, beacons in spawnrooms or liberators firing through the biolab roof.   Outfit officer needs to adress it as something that they clearly don't approve but i wouldn't kick valuable people out of outfit for it. Especially when it does no harm to either friendly faction or quality of fights against enemies. It just pads some stats and earns people some certs. Unless you care about stats or feel threatened by other people earning certs then you've got no argument.  When Libs and ESF's could shrek people from beyond draw distance... Did you ever exploit it? We sure as hell did."

PS2Cobalt,34porg,Sotanaki,-1,Sun May 3 15:15:14 2015 UTC,Maybe rather a full air squad dedicated to AG that you spread in groups of 2/3 and send to different bases?  Because I myself know that I probably wouldn't have much trouble to take down an ESF driven by a non-experienced pilot that wouldn't know how to ground pound without hovering (deci) or simply avoid G-A lockon missiles by driving them into the terrain  We should also do the leap-frog thing with a SL dropping a beacon with an ESF

PS2Cobalt,34oafu,Shumakun,3,Sun May 3 11:45:48 2015 UTC,Calling out on (non-existent) double standards doesn't change the fact that you're exploiting. XP is rewarded for fighting enemies or helping your team fight the enemy - not abusing loopholes in game mechanics.  If the respect of this sub is what you're after you can start by cutting on your bullshit excuses and acknowledging what you're doing wrong...
PS2Cobalt,34oafu,BlckJck103,2,Mon May 4 08:19:47 2015 UTC,"Shooting friendly sundy ain't no exploit. Using that to get infinite xp is.   Maybe I need to turn into 100% HA tryhard to earn respesct on this sub, lol   Duh"
PS2Cobalt,34oafu,Shumakun,3,Sun May 3 11:53:22 2015 UTC,"First, I replied to your comment in the thread about Statpadders the other day.  Most of us are aware of JohnDooX. Also his VS alt that did it completely till BR100. He has been reported by multiple people and we expect his accounts to be banned shortly.  More than just Kukuruku are lagswitching, I reported 2 people yesterday for it and have seen many of these accounts being removed.  JEST Tk'ing people in stream? If you are referring to Daddy1986 (Kain) stream, I spoke to him the following day. Although he said Jesters at first (due to some Archeage fallout) he agreed that it wasnt us. I investigated it fully and our players matched with TS logs. After more investigation it was the guys from FIZO who were doing it (you muight remember them as the guys on VS who spam all the nazi stuff in command). Daddy agreed aswell after having looked into this. The fact that one of them referenced Jesters in his name was designed to convince people like you that it is what we do.  aaaaaaaand finally, a post from Higby (RIP) on March 14, 2014   Our policy on bug exploits is simple, if you are caught or found to have been exploiting a bug/glitch for personal gain or harassment of your fellow players, even if the bug is of no fault of your own, your account may be suspended or banned depending on the severity. If you find yourself in a bugged state, whether that's stuck in a wall where players can't shoot you or in a vehicle that can't take damage, the safe bet is to submit a bug report and redeploy.   So you are wrong, you do not need to be a 100% HA tryhard to get respect from this sub. But a good place to start is not to openly exploit and attempt to defend it on a sub. And then after that, DO NOT SHOW UP IN A THREAD ABOUT STATPADDERS TRYING TO HAVE SOME FORM OF MORAL HIGH GROUND .... I mean, are you really that stupid?  Edit: In hindsight there was a flaw in my first point. I confused your Reddit ID with /u/schumuchen . The only apology I have to offer is to Schumuchen for confusing him with you"
PS2Cobalt,34oafu,BlckJck103,-11,Sun May 3 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't posting in any thread about statpadding on this sub.  Higby post dont prove that you are right, because we still dont know if xp from friendly damage is bug or new thing. If this is not bug then this method is 100% legit."
PS2Cobalt,34oafu,Shumakun,11,Sun May 3 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"My god you are fucking dumb.  It doesn't have to be a bug to be bannable. The smallest amount of common sense will tell you this is exploiting. There's no ""bug"" in having an alt and knifing/reviving in the corner of a map. It's still bannable. Why? because if you seriously think that the top-tier of the game should be shooting friendly sunderers then you're as dumb as you appear from your posts. This is bannable, just like all other forms of stat-padding and XP farming are (well not BKNE, that's legit Stat-padding and farming.).  There's no moral equivilancy, yes other people abuse this bug and might not get reddit posts about it, yes other people abuse other bugs. No Tk'ing is not the same thing. Only intentional TK to the level where it would be considered in-game harassment is. How does that mean you're allowed to do it as well? Such an idiotic argument.

PS2Cobalt,34oafu,Shumakun,7,Sun May 3 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"At least Im grown enough that I'm not insulting anybody.   Just not grown enough to have gone to school yet apparently.

Knifing/reviving is different story m8, sure shooting friendly sundy is dumb, but it don't brake any in game rules, its design flaw and DBG should fix this, but like I told before if this is not bug then this is legit.   It's exactly the same. You just won't admit it cause you're doing it. You're exploiting the game and trying to bend rules. It obvious that being able to earn XP by attacking friendlies is not how the game is designed to be played. Other mechanics similar to this will not yield the same results.   You hide behind the fact that you haven't seen an official announcement on it, it doesn't need one, it's so obvious. The fact you keep going back to ""is this a bug"" shows you have no understanding of the game rules. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUG, TO BE BANNABLE. Stat-Padding like Knife/Revive isn't a bug. You can still get banned for it.  In a few days when all the reports start rolling in, you'll receive your ban for this and then maybe realise this."

PS2Cobalt,34oafu,Aloysyus,2,Sun May 3 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"lol I'm not saying that something need to be a bug to be bannable, but by your logic spawnroom warriors should be banned too, ammo in WG too and many other things if used much.    Ammo in warpgate is already affected by game mechanics so you can't just farm it. Spawnroom warriors are a legitimate part of the game, unless you're getting someone on the other faction to feed you kills it just happening naturally.  The issue isn't being able to get XP from these things. It's abusing them. There's nothing wrong with XP from rep sundies. But sitting them away from a fight and damaging them to intentionally farm XP is clearly exploiting the game.   It's simple: Are you arguing that you believe they put repair XP in the game so that people could sit away from a fight and farm certs?  If you do, then i return to my first sentence, first post. If you're not then you must see what you do as exploiting. You're intentionally playing the game in a way that is clearly not what the devs intended in anyway.    Dunno how old are, but surly you don't need to use bad words, I can only hope that your attitude in RL is somewhat better    My aren't we getting defensive. I said you were dumb, it's hardly a ""bad"" word. It's actually an accurate description of you in this thread. Based on the fact that you exploit game mechanics and then argue there's nothing wrong with it.  Your argument is based on a weak moral equivalency; that because other people do bad things, you do bad things. The fact you keep saying you need the developers to tell you something which 99% of the game realise without their help also doesn't help you.  In the end, I return to my original point, If you don't want to be called ""dumb"" then maybe come up with a smarter defence for the fact your exploiting a game than either: ""I can't think for myself"" or ""He did it first, so i did it after""."

This is similiar case. Im not saying that devs intended this, but still they introduced possibility to do it. It should be fixed by devs, but still using this dont make it bannable offence.

PS2Cobalt,34p9vg,Jellafish,2,Mon May 4 08:28:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize it at the time but holy wall of text batman, i will leave a tl;dr at the bottom.  I cant really speak for everyone here but i can say why i stopped. Infantry was a part of the game i never really touched. When i play a game or a sport i always strive to improve. When I reach how good i wanted to be or if i reach a point where i feel i cant improve anymore without insane amounts of training i get bored. At the moment i am playing WoT and currently have a goal of becoming unicum if that means anything to anyone reading this.  I got to a point flying where i felt i could challenge everyone so flying on live felt more like a chore than something that was fun for me to do. I hated the lock on spam, the gank squads. The feeling of no matter how good i was i would always die. It was just too much, I had nothing to keep me wanting to improve so i stopped.  When i started playing infantry it was very frustrating. But it was something i knew i could improve on and wanted to do as a result of me being that kind of person. I didn't really care that much for scrims, they were a nice change from the grinding of live but that's about it.  Tanking was always fun, the only problem was the fights. The usual indar crossroads fight was a favorite of mine and im sure a lot of others in fqql considering the famous gylle 'X-ROADS GOGOGOGOGOGO'. But once cont locking was a thing those fights barely happened.   TL;DR We were all burnt out from vehicles i guess. Infantry was just something that was never the same, always unpredictable and takes more time and effort to become good at. It had lots of different weapons that requires a different playstyle to do well with and trying to learn these playstyles was everything that was fun (for me at least)."
PS2Cobalt,34p9vg,NerfDragonhawks,1 point,Mon May 4 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"Wasn't even that much and I enjoy your posts, also liked the ones in the other topic which were even longer.   I can see what you mean with the frustration in flying, I had the same with tanking actually, deaths felt so... binary. Like you'd get caught out of position by a Vanguard and that's it. Of couse if you improve positioning etc. even more but there's not too much of a payoff (at least for me). With regards to the ganksquads and locks, with Libs I always felt that even if we got jumped by 4 lock-on scrubs we could salvage the situation if everything went well but of course that's not possible in an ESF."
PS2Cobalt,34p9vg,Jellafish,1 point,Mon May 4 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Well you are right, libs can definitely hold their own against a gank squad especially if it is you and bottledd crewing that lib. I gunned for a while on miller and experienced that. Dalton gunning was always something that was fun for me, i just lost interest when it got nerfed against infantry as it felt too specialized for me and my pilots style of play.  To do well in the prowler i feel it is all about positioning and not being too aggressive in particular. But like you said, the payoff i feel isn't that great especially when you can yolo behind a zerg and get a bunch of kills then instantly spawn another.  I think the one thing in this game i never grew bored of was libbing, i just never seemed to get frustrated when playing lib. I can see how you and bottledd did it for so long."

PS2Cobalt,34oayh,light24bulbs,3,Thu Jun 18 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"ursa is a fcking beast in med-long range, it kills and hits so hard like a sniper, though u have to be clicking your trigger cause it has high recoil and the bullets start shoot every if u you're holding the trigger for a while. So holding your trigger button for around 3-1 seconds depending on the range should be a beast of a gun when you master it. Both the Ursa and Ns15 lack in close range because of their rate of fire is pretty low, so keep In mind where to lead your targets in close range.   I must add that the Ns15 is very good in long range too with much less recoil but I would say it won't hit harder nor kill faster then the ursa  My opinion if you're looking for something for more challenge but much rewarding go for ursa  If you want something easier to handle with the fastest reload speed out of the lmg then get the ns15"

But always when u have to much fun with Ursa on long range some snipers will eventually ruin it.  But to Ts i would use ns15, its pretty good close range, good long and mid range aswell, good hipfire and the  0.75 makes it really good. You can also stand inside a Nc zergball shoting it cause of the neutral sound."

PS2Cobalt,34oayh,QueenVanuCeres,2,Sun May 3 07:23:39 2015 UTC,Ursa is like a fucking headshot machine! Sometimes you don't need to think about HS because is like the weapon move automatically to the head.  The ns is cool too but the low damage can be a problem if you are not a headshot player.
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Selerox,2,Sun May 3 08:15:13 2015 UTC,NS-15M without hesitation. The Ursa made me want to throw my PC out the window.

PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Selerox,1 point,Sun May 3 08:35:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, it was effective, it's just boring as sin to use.  When it comes to long range, I enjoyed the Corvus a lot more than the Ursa."
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Nuklartouch,1 point,Sun May 3 09:36:04 2015 UTC,"Corvus is pretty nice, but i find CME alot better on range maybe because it has faster Velocity (easier to lead) and u can defend urself if anyone come close aswell. Think it got better Accuracy and lower recoil aswell."
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Selerox,2,Sun May 3 10:34:38 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed, the CME is just a better weapon. The Corvus is almost a great weapon, but it has a few massive flaws that just hamstring it. Give it the same velocity as the CME and up the RoF by just a fraction (up to the same level as the Ursa or maybe even the Flare) and it'd be worth using, even if only on a situational basis.  As it stands, I just couldn't recommend the Corvus over the CME."

PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Sotanaki,1 point,Sun May 3 12:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yeaaaaaaah I still prefer the Polaris over the Pulsar. It might come from the fact that I auraxed the Pulsar before the Polaris, so I may have gotten better with time and had the impression of doing better with the Polaris than with the Pulsar, but I still remember the Pulsar as a decent weapon, and the Polaris as a Headshot machine.  No opinion on the lasher though, I hate this weapon."
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,okpbro,1 point,Sun May 3 12:34:14 2015 UTC,"both are as easy to use or some would say ""headshot machines"" due to lack of recoil, the difference is more ROF (698 or 650) or SPA & ALS & +50 magsize...   i'll take ROF everyday."
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Sotanaki,1 point,Sun May 3 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"Then it's probably a mistake from my side. Because, ironically, I don't like the SVA so much like some people do because the Orion has those 50 extra ROF."
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Punisher_Ps2,2,Sun May 3 14:25:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely the ns15m, cause it´s more versatile and easy to control, as well you can get easy headshots with it. It´s better in cqc as well, due to 0.75 movement speed, so go with the ns15. Ursa is only viable at long ranges and has bad dps overall."

PS2Cobalt,34oayh,testsample,1 point,Sun May 3 10:15:13 2015 UTC,"Ursa is better if you like low ROF.  if you prefer high ROF, go for the NS-15, it has low ROF, but it still is a better option than the Ursa in this case.  that being said, I prefer the Ursa all the way over the NS-15"
PS2Cobalt,34oayh,Cornelisatorus,1 point,Sun May 3 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"I dont have any experience with the Ursa, but the ns-15...there are 2 versions out there which can be bought with certs, i was surprised and i immediately bought it to be able to auraxium it again. Very versatile weapon and useful, if your aim is good and you can land the headshots. The recoil is one of the easiest to control and the 0.75 ADS movement makes it alot easier to clear corners (or to ADAD dance). I had/am having a lot of fun with it."

PS2Cobalt,34kbud,Slippyfist69,3,Sat May 2 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"That was a lot of fun and I look forward to the next one :).  I hope we see a bit more organised play day-to-day now too.  In truth there's no reason that live play can't be like that in general, but planning and anticipating the event seems to get people's arses into gear.  We really need to work on the quality of leadership though, which has been one of our main problems in Server Smash lately.  Literally 100% of flanking attempts (or use of any tactic that wasn't just a linear push towards the point) were extremely successful.  Too many of our outfits either push from spawn to point when defending or point to enemy spawn when attacking.  It's a poor use of forces that plays into your opponents hands.  I want to see more flanking and creative tactics."

PS2Cobalt,34kbud,Rangerdanvers,2,Sat May 2 00:43:24 2015 UTC,You won´t need to do much more than sign up on the spreadsheet that we will put in the briefing next week. At some point you will have to set up whispers (everything is well explained on our TS). We don´t know what outfits have Ops on what days. That´s why it will only take place once a month and we´ll try to impact actual live gameplay (eg. alerts) as little as possible. Everyone who is running Ops on that day will be informed to either go to the continent with the alert on or another continent via orders/command.

So when we win it's because overpop or our glorious maxes in 33/33/33 fight but when it's you winning it's somehow different? If you'd play on our server and our faction when NC got it's A game going in alert you'd realize that not only do we face same problems that other two factions face but we also win a lot of fights with an even population or underpop and this included the outfits that drop four galaxies onto bases.   From my perspective it's show that NC casual outfits can organize and win fight but if you rate them lowly then next time you get pushed of by Re4 or MB1 in an even fight and i know for a fact that it happens to TR and VS elite mlg noscopers more often than they'd like to admit. Just think that you didn't loose to that max crash or that platoon pushing because the zergshitters outplayed you in dedication to the fight but because you were too shit to stop them instead.

Nuke might say some stupid shit but he understands that value of maxes is limited in a prolonged redeployside of a an alert.  You pull them when you need them and in low numbers for platoon support but generally versility and expendability of HA is more prefered option for a seasoned SL/PL
PS2Cobalt,34in9f,RetOld,1 point,Fri May 1 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"get mad stay bad  seriously though it might be due to poor alert strategy; you dont win via capping fast, you win by goading the other 2 empires into farming each other:  so your losing at halfway: but have lots of routes for expansion: then by 1:30-1:45 you ideally will be winning but have your front focused on a few chokes: with the other 2 teams still squabbling over the middle or their farm."

PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Ometen,1 point,Sun May 3 10:12:09 2015 UTC,Imao the burster squad was fun! Eventhough i was a medic mainly it felt good to be the saveheaven for the other pilots. i would have prefered flying aswell but still it was satesfieng to fullfill that important task (atleast in the first 30 mins).
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Spitcat,2,Sun May 3 11:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was for sure something that should have been done, however when the large majority of people in the air force were last minute infantry players filling in for the people who fucked off just before the game [and they did a great job] I felt as if maybe a ground squad should have been put in the role we were, and have 3 air squads + 1 GROUND SQUAD with buster's, who could easily been used as a force to attack and defend.  Allot of the time we were just shooting at 1 esf from render range..  just saying, next time we are short on 'pilots' don't put 'Pilots' in a ground squad and people why just 'wna fly' in the AIR PLATOON.  PS.. this is not a dig at any of the command just something to take note on. glhf in the next game"
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Punisher_Ps2,1 point,Sun May 3 13:53:26 2015 UTC,You wasn´t flying last time o.O. I think that is a waste of good pilots if you put guys like spit or ometen into the burster squad. Three air squads and one ground burster squad is good as long as you put ground players into the burster squad. Otherwise that´s just a waste of potential imo.
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Ometen,3,Mon May 4 12:02:29 2015 UTC,"but still for me it was the most enjoyable ss experience so far becouse the squad was working really close together, emil was a good sl and we were recking tons of aircrafts out of the skys in the opening. But than they switched to guerilla tactics and from that moment we became pretty much useless and we didnt transition fast enough to an airsquad.   Personally i am not the biggest fan of seperation from gound and airfolks. For me it feels like we have two cobalt teams participating in the serversmash and if we loose everyone blames the other wich creates a verry hostile enviroment on our server.   IMAO we need more flexible platoons and players to play the combined arms game. And elitist pilots bitching about getting put in a burster squad doesnt help the couse.  Yes i agree the potantial could have been used in a different way but IMAO every ss participant needs to be ready to bring some sacrefices for the greater good awell."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Punisher_Ps2,2,Mon May 4 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"seperation from gound and airfolks   This. Yeah tbh this just put us into useless bitching at each other after we lost one match. I would like it, if everybody is appreciating the input from each side and not bitch about it to make them feel better.  Still I think if you utilize your capabilites to the maximum, than you get a better result at the end."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Spitcat,1 point,Mon May 4 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"its not bitching, if there is no one to point out the obvious then nothing will change in the next match."

That was sure kind of fun but it was tiring for two hours. Apart from the fact that I was in the air for like 5 minutes ofc"
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Ometen,1 point,Tue May 5 20:59:36 2015 UTC,lol i dont know what you were doing but the squad transitioned from aa burster to aa-a2g scythes after 40-50 min.

PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Sotanaki,1 point,Tue May 5 22:16:37 2015 UTC,40/50 minutes? I remember way more than that. Maybe it was because it was utterly boring but it definetely felt more than 1 hour

PS2Cobalt,34fh81,AsdfjklaWHOSTOLEMYNA,11,Sat May 2 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"Your statement is false. It would take only one SS where you  continuously get farmed by enemy air to realize that.  Some of us have been around for enough SS's to have seen this in person and to know exactly what role air plays in these matches, you clearly don't.

PS2Cobalt,34fh81,RachitynowyJoe,3,Sat May 2 09:47:32 2015 UTC,"It is completely the other way. You can have total wankers on the point facing best of the best if you have air covered properly. No max push, no mlg players get onto point if you have 10 meters of open terrain to groundpound them. But maybe you are talking about closed up bases but those are irrelevant to discussion about air :D  I don't care about your name. I probably won't know you anyway because i live in my small own world, seperate from all of the server society.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but this isn't drama. You've not done anything in the way of creating a drama, just given some people something to poke at a little bit on a weekend.  There's not some huge split in a team, in the server, because of this. In fact it's probably the most galvanising thing I've seen in a while. Even people who might agree with you are in complete agreement with each other"
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Sat May 2 11:00:57 2015 UTC,"This is the point i cannot agree. But as well we cant make solid statement about it. This is too... i lack vocabulary here... liquid? Inconsistent? Each base and each cap is different in so many ways we cannot say anything definite. But i still strongly believe that air is most important factor. I might be wrong, but my ps2 experience gives me feeling that having a2g support and not is extreme difference.    Yet i must admit that as part of air squad i did not perform well last time. Many eill downvote me but i still think that air need changes to what it was during emerald and miller smash. Like papa vanu said, i did not failed cobalt, i've failed yourself.   Yet i think you are making contradictions here. You said that squad can suppress many but at the same time you said that you don't feel groumd pounded now. There might be some factors that you cannot observe now that affects air game. Maybe wr have air atalemate and ground doesnt feel air at all? I know that air can do massive impact but atm cobalt air is not changing course of battle now. Either smashes changed or our level had changed. Either means we must find solution   at this point i would be considering staying annon myself. It is true that you attracted attention now. But still, you will face the offense of cowardice that can deny every argument. In your place i would talk yo my outfit rep and pass my judgement. Judging from your responses you are not troll after all because you are not adjusting your responses to piss everyone. That is why i think you are concerned about smashes and this is feeling i can identify with. We might have different pov but think that if you give it a try everyone at least consider your suggestion if given through proper, more private channels."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,halospud,3,Sat May 2 11:03:54 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that you don't lead and you haven't got much Smash experience and that's how you've managed to be so wrong.  I'm not interested in counters and arguing.  Arguing on the internet bores the tits off me.  I want to know who you are so I know whether it's worth educating you or not.  You're being very persistent in your cowardice though so I'm done here until you post your name.  Going to have a word with the mods too.  There have been a lot of people trolling here anonymously of late and it shouldn't be allowed.  This is a forum for players on Cobalt so your in game name should be a requirement.
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,halospud,2,Sat May 2 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"Your post history consists of almost 100% you arguing with people or trying to create arguments.  You're a twat.  Is that ad hominem enough for you?  When you grow up, you'll learn that nobody in the real world gives a flying fuck about proper arguing technique and that people who take pleasure in arguing are widely disliked."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,BlckJck103,4,Sat May 2 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"you say spineless, I say liberating   Why? You're capable of saying anything with a name, without one, you just seem as some idiot trying to stir up drama, if you want an actual debate on smash tactics there's many ways to get one. Anon shitposting, isn't going to get it. Anonymity is in no way conducive to discussion, and people are rightly skeptical of it.   I had a quick read through your attempts to appear informed and intelligent but your arguments jump from here to there without really a common thread in anything. It really just comes across like you want to create an argument between people rather than you have something useful to say.   You first oppose dedicated pilots because we need better ground. As if those options were mutually exclusive. At later points you argue about the usefulness of ground-pounding. Now this is something that can be considered, especially the over-saturation of bases with A2G ESFs and the limited use of air-power from ground platoons for this purpose. You also minorly address A2A but only to bitch about things again. It comes across as if you don't like the current air, but don't really have 1) a clear idea about what you don't like about it & 2) any idea about how to make it better.  You offer no reasoned thought on really any matter, at least nothing but the most basic analysis, which has/should already be in the mind of most of the HC (even nowadays). You offer no solutions, no new ideas.    this is essentially trolling, but it's just a bastardised way to reject the politics of cobalt high command.  you would probably hate if I was in charge, most would, but we would be better, more effective   much lols. You reject those politics, Fight the power brother, ""or sister"", yes or sister Reg.  See now your argument shifts again.   Tl;DR  You have come up with nothing new in even the smallest form. Your shifting and basic arguments show a lack of thought and suggest you want to create drama more than actually have something interesting or even relevant to say."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,BlckJck103,2,Sat May 2 12:55:44 2015 UTC,"I consider the way the air is played to be a waste of time and in cobalts case a masive waste of manpower.   There may be a case for the over use of air. It's inflexibility at certain bases and it's predominance for one thing over others. But not to be such a waste to drop it completely.   when you have the same number of players having 2 dozen players in the air has significant effects on ground, therefor the 2 are mutually exclusive.   Obvious, also unfounded, if you believe 24 ground players can be more effective than 24 in the air then fair enough. But that's all, you think it.   I never argue for ground pounding, I argue for spawn point denial. Killing 20 people is useless when they can redeploy within 10 seconds.   It's not useless, it's 10seconds. It also spreads things out, 12 people followed by 12 people 10 seconds later is much easier to defend than 24 at once. The only discussion is the level of air that becomes a waste, where the ground pounding is now taking more of our resources than hindering the enemy. I've said in the past Cobalt's dedicated air needs to move away form ground-pounding, a handful of ESFs and Gals can do the job.   I think A2a is strategically useless, and considering how much time it takes a waste of valuable time, it's literally a dick measuring contest between air knights. It should have no place in a SS.   Incorrect. Air control is key as a mobility tool, especially for QRF type squads and the top level of platoons and squads. Forcing people to use only redeploy to safely move is both too slow and dangerous. Losing the ability to safely move gals between bases is a complete ballache for a squad.   I don't like how air is used generally and how much it takes away in man power on cobalt in particular from the fight that actually matters.   I've spoken to this. It's probably the closest you get to having a really relevant point. The key is experimenting and adapting after each game to find the level where air power is being used most effectively.   You remove DEDICATED from the strategy. You make a list of potential pilots and you use them to service the ground defense and deny spawns exclusively.   And how does this get organised. Do you spread pilots out to make sure each squad gets one, let them play together, how to attempt to do anything in the air if you intend to lose control every 5 minutes. There have been a number of experiments with the Air over many smashes. If you were someone in a position to know anything you'd know that the air and how it has been commanded has changed a lot as well.   The issue is not with having dedicated air but refining the command and control structures that get the right amount to the right places. Ensuring that the air focuses on key roles at all time rather than sometimes losing its focus. Air control > Killing Spawns > Killing Infantry.  I don't see the tactical or strategical sense in trying to zerg the enemy with ground forces while only going to the air when needed. This sacrifices air control for only a small gain in the forces, giving the enemy greater mobility and force projection and hindering your own."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,RachitynowyJoe,3,Sat May 2 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"Heh, you might see what it means to have no airforce this match. I hope it will be what cobalt needs and will mean victory."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,killALLilluminati,6,Sat May 2 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"Wtf? Are u serious without the air we had against Miller, we would have been warpgated, most players in each air squads were forced to take AG setup to help the ground, we saved soo many bases for our ground forces, but it was the lack of response time for our infantry to the enemies infantry forces taking other bases. So don't come here and make false accusations my dear unknown one. I cannot blame neither the air nor infantry cause I am not in the position to know what actually went wrong, suggest some ways we could have improved on instead of trash talking"
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Punisher_Ps2,3,Sat May 2 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"Just ignore him. He said after the last smash that my spot was ""wasted"", because I wasn´t doing only A2G and playing too ""safe"" to be efficient.  Guess if we do what he suggested, than you get as a result that you will be AH and lolpodded 24/7, without able to respond quick enough to that. You will lose more bases, cause you will not have the guys flying to respond to it or they will get wiped out from the enemy air.  Last point here, he doesn´t even have a identity next to his reddit name. That just shows how weak and how bad he is, cause he isn´t up for discussing with his real ingame identity. He is a little cunt who is talking shit and trying to make arguments without showing who he is. That´s just weak and not worth talking imo."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,killALLilluminati,2,Sat May 2 11:57:09 2015 UTC,"I ignored him after he replied to me, I was literally pulling my hair and shoving a book (yes I'm a student :)) in my mouth so I won't scream. Especially when he said casual pilots should be flying instead of dedicated pilots...........DAFUUUUQQQQQQ!!!!!!!   I also said ""my dear unkown"" cause he won't reveal who he is. And couldn't give 2 shits who he is. Hope these bitches get removed...we have to have a new policy 'NO FAKE OR UNIDENTIFIABLE ACCOUNTS'"
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,RachitynowyJoe,3,Sat May 2 13:21:37 2015 UTC,"That is not how it works  1) your vision how air is organised is entirely wrong. Air platoon had a structure and was ordered to do stuff. You can argue if it was effective or done properly(ofc if valid point are made) but stating that air is constantly jerking off somwhere and are disconnected from the match is... untruthful at least.  2) SS air is not live air. One squad is easily denied and saying it will cover entire continent is bollocks. Please watch streams with careful notice when caster sees air battle.   3) duels... in wider pov duels are obstacles. But it is only way to destroy enemy air. You propose what? Air should escape or ram into ground? Please state alternative action because actually i don't know what you mean  4) i've personally denied flow of forces from one sundy for 30 sec with 1,5 ppa scythe last match (say what you want i find it impressive during ss). I didn't focus sundy because i would have to let enemy ground go to the point. Ofc i didnt recapped the point myself but i think i ""farmed"" a bit for victory...  Air must ""farm"" enemy you cant cap point by simply shoving bodies into enemy face."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,Macinzon,1 point,Sat May 2 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"Our air is doing well in the Smashes, but from my experience, if you want to cap a base or ground infantry should pull their own A2G scythes/reavers/mossies. 1 or 2 per squad makes hell of a difference already."

PS2Cobalt,34fh81,NerfDragonhawks,2,Sat May 2 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"I bet you that most infantry players give 100% durring a SS, as a pilot you just wank off.    Yeah we totally didn't give it our all when we fought PREY and co."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,NerfDragonhawks,5,Sat May 2 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Where is it bragging? You said we, unlike the infantry, don't give 100% which is clearly not true."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Sat May 2 07:47:45 2015 UTC,"If you propose removing ""dedicated"" this should not affect air only. Having dedicated ground is as unflexible as dedicated air.  But... not having dedicated setups brings problems. Nanites are constantly flowing and you cannot reliably say when you can pull ESF squad if you do ground play at decent level(not using nanites just in case you will have to get ESFs is blocking your effectivness on ground drastically)  Having a positive K/D was discussed many times. I do support idea that you have to kill to be effective. And you have to kill as much as you can. Deaths are not so important if you die properly(ie stoping cap in last seconds just throwing your body for A to blink).   In air situation is slightly different than on ground. Your death means 350 nanites lost and 30 seconds until you will be fully operational again. That is why you don't want to die frequently. There are critical situations where you would rather get into burster fire just to ground pound a bit max push. But still it is generally not good idea to sacrifice yourself a lot. Nonetheless in air you have to use your firepower to the fullest. You said that destroying sundies should be priority. I say it very depends. Hornets take several volleys to kill sundy and only if it is unrepaired. It means you are letting more or less 20s+ spawn time for enemy attack force. 20s+ time you could assist your defensive ground troops in their advance to the point. It might be invisible for them but each time they pass empty engi turret blocking their way or they see enemy crawling under the rooftops it means you done something right. After point is resecured you should focus on sundy(depends of course of situation).  TBH, i am not saying cobalt air is perfect(far from it). I said what i wanted to say after miller match in seperate thread and found valid points that other stated back then. But denying air significance just because we lost several times is too extreme."
PS2Cobalt,34fh81,pintle,2,Sat May 2 08:08:44 2015 UTC,"Really? the last 2 cobalt matches proved just how useless air dominance is. Cobalt needs more experienced ground players, not to waste 24 spots on ""dedicated pilots"" AGAIN.   Air dominance without making use of it is useless.  Air dominance used well wins matches.

After you get used to it playing vanu just doesn't feel the same. All the weapons feel very similar to one another, look borderline identical and handle with neglable differences. Sure they have their ups and down but non of them deviate too far one from the other. On NC everything leans heavily either in one direction or another."

PS2Cobalt,34b6gs,DRMONSTAA,4,Thu Apr 30 10:28:26 2015 UTC,"Big balls =/= desire to fly  I do not know how long you have been playing the game, but the BLNG guys have been for a very long time, probably more than you.   There is a limit to everything and that last update was the line they shouldn't have crossed so, quoting Bequ, ""they gave us a straight fck you"", and most of us are responding to that by not flying.   Trust me, this has nothing to do with relearning the controls, if the game was in beta, then yes we would've adapted, but implementing something of this scale in a game after 2 years post release? Did you ever see this in any other game? Don't think so.  You should also know that XTC stopped playing way before the update, and his level was off the charts when he did, so yes he is still elite. You do not have to be playing the game to be considered elite, if you are a member of the elite, there is a reason for it. This status is not just something that disappears when you leave the game."

The fact that DBG decides to implement the console control on the pc version is nothing but careless and retarded. Pilots gave them feedback, yet they put it on. This is horrible marketing and shows what they really think of the community and their opinion. Me and the others don't want to be a part of that anymore, SOE did it long enough already.

You quit the game that's fine but don't think your still an elite when your not playing.

PS2Cobalt,3495cd,Diskriminator,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair there needs to be made an distinction between JNA troops and the paramilitary forces operating in Republica Sprska even if supported by Serbian State.    The subject is not one i've invested that much time on but from what i've read it seems like everyone was complete wankers to everyone throughout the Yugo Wars. Serbs just were in a position to do more since they were the biggest boys on the block until Western European and Murikah intervened. Serbs were also the ones to take the fall for everyone once things were made clear and loose ends were tied up.  Basically Serbs miscalculated their geopolitical odds big time. They relied on idea that it would be internal conflict between warring parties only with limited outside military support. In that scenario they held the upper hand and maintained multiple Serb breakaway regions within other Yugoslav Republics while having strategic parity and operational success.   But by that time the successor of the Soviet State and biggest Serbian ally in Continental Europe was out of the game. Russia was knee deep in it's own shit and did not have the capability nor will to provide substential support either on political or military level. Where Russian Federation wasn't willing to commit the Western States were more than eager to do so against the Serbians.  So JNA and the Breakaway Regions were left with a very grim strategic realities where their adveseries could extend their operational conduct and get both intelligence, covert and in some cases open support to achieve majority of their military goals.  On political level they would likewise get support. The desolution of the Yugoslav state in itself was not entirely within legal norms and borders were not set nor astablished but western powers made it clear that within such a murky waters the breakaway regions were in itself illegal and within boundries of republics that technically broke away illegaly themselves.  It's always interesting to watch it all unfold. Almost all ex-soviet block states experianced it. The most amusing part of it all is how they usually break away from the ""Big Bad"" but when someone wants to break away from them on ethnic, political or religious reasons they go to war to maintain control over those regions. Soviets are to blame in a lot of case for setting up these young states for the fall because soviets redrew alot of borders based on function the region was supose to fulfill rather than ethnicities these regions filled. Since everyone was in soviet union anyways it made no difference but when you go indie everything changes ofcourse.  The End Game in the regions was to calm things down in the European back yard so to speak, astablish solid borders without any huge pitfalls and at the same time push Serbian State out of Russian sphere of influence. The border problem was resolved completely on expense of the Serbs which in turn put them into a very weak position with full realisation that they either play ball or get buttfucked to oblivion since they got no friends to back them up while their enemies got super power and economic juggernaut to do so for them. This is why Operations against Republica Sprska and Serbian Kraijina were basically overlooked or borderline overtly supported by the West. All in all it was a great geopolitical and regional move against two weakened powers. It's sort of backfired in 2008 Georgia and now Ukraine is the next frontline but lessons were learned and stakes have been raised.  Gentlemen we are witnessing the dawn of a new cold war and shifting regional geopolitical dynamics."

If you're peasant then you look like Niko Bellic regardless if you're in the most west part of Poland right on the border with Germoney stealing their cars.

If you are very good, then you can even take the RAMS for CQC but it is quite difficult since you have to take the reload time into account.   I am saying all this assuming you are decent at aggressive sniping."

PS2Cobalt,340i5r,RetOld,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:39:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on what lessons you take from it. You can't apply anything concrete but you might learn some of the basics of maneuver warfare and tactical foresight that have application to PS2.  Knowing human psychology and being able to read when the winds blow your way or where you can simply exploit your enemy or what to expect from him means that you can benefit from it greatly and bring a better performance overal.   I find soviet doctrines relying on down to earth concepts meant to lead close to 2 million men in battle to be most applicable to PS2 since they're designed around well trained but fluid infantry and armored formations where task supersedes the norms.  So for example when i'm leading an infantry squad and i've done the 10min introductionary training my usual squad structure is 3HA/3HA/3HA/2MED/1ENG. This is rigid form so everyone is on same page and squad is divided into four fire teams. Each Fire Team has a simple single task and requirements are to execute it without fail or deviation. These roles do not change for the squad regardless where they enter or what structure it is. The only difference is when to start the tactical maneuver.   So after stacking up fallowed by entry command the whole squad pushes through the door.   FT1 always will peel of to the left checking the flank first and then shifting attention to the center while maintaining movement at their assigned flank. FT2 will clear Center and keep pushing to closest cover infront of them.  FT3 will peel of Right and mirror actions of the FT1. FT4 being medics and engineer enter one second later. It's enough time for the breach team to either clear the room or get killed.  Good example is the Biolab Generator room. If you need to clear second floor first from the small stairs then they will start peeling of and clearing it once they reach the top of the stairs. If it's generator at the first floor then they will enter through the door and run imidiately to the right past the small stairs and only then start start breaking up into individual fire teams and clearing their assigned sectors.  When i'm in that squad structure and part of FT1 for example and i'm making entry i might note 1-2 enemies center or to the right. I'll report them stat but not engage them since they are not my responsibility and continue pushing left and checking that corner first.  From that stock squad you then can mold whatever you require. If you need Max support at center on entry. Assign FT2 2x maxes+engineer. Tandem entry. So you'll basically have squad members numbered 4 and 5 pick skillsuits and 6 change into additional squad engineer dedicated on keeping both maxes alive. Both maxes work together taking damage and moving to cover for repairs while the other one keeps watch. Huggis shields are awesome in this scenario.  In vehicles everyone forms a single column behind as we move out. When i order a ""LINE LEFT"" the vehicle right behind me will move on my left side, then the vehicle behind him will move on his left side and so on. When we move out again everyone just stacks up back into column without any sort of formalities on who was where at the start until ordered to form a line again and the cycle continues.  long post is long, kek."

PS2Cobalt,33xeel,DRMONSTAA,3,Sun Apr 26 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't see any constructive critiques in this post so I'll try to make one for you :)  First of all, it is a very nice edit, and the quality of your clips are good. Your music choice is also good and I give you that.  However, there is a discrepancy between the music/edit and your clips and you can see that right from the beginning. You chose ""epic"" musics but your clips do not follow that mindset, especially the easy shots with your deployed prowler or the reaver dumbfire part.  Also, if you are going to make an infantry montage, do not put only HA clips, and clips where the enemy isn't that aware of your presence. If you are going to put HA clips, make sure they are exceedingly good, meaning that they show superior aim, and tactics where you outbrain the enemy (not like if you flank a point where no one knows you're there).  Assuming this is your first montage, it is a good one, and you should keep it up considering the amount of work you put into the edit so you have my upvote ;)"
PS2Cobalt,33xeel,EvilGh0st,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have put ""HA"" in the title :3 That's almost the only kind of clips I have, because of this sooooo long HA directive. So put something else is pretty difficult, since I'm 100% infantry for now. I'll keep the other things in mind, thank you, really :) Even though my next montage won't be ""that"" worked on, I think."

Some of the encounters he had and room clearing he did wasn't bad either. Overal the video is edited well and shows different scenarios keeping it entertaining throughout.

PS2Cobalt,33xyr9,RetOld,2,Sun Apr 26 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"I was on his platoon few weeks back.   He seems to like to talk a lot. General concensus between JEST squad i was leading under his platoon structure is that he talks a bit to much though. Apperently some people consider that he was doing a ""stream of consciousness"" for an hour and a half.   It's an odd approach but honestly and personally i don't mind. Others did though and not to be insultive to him i do find he might want to be more precise in when he speaks and what he states in general platoon play. Limit the chat to vital, keep the uncessary bullshit out of it. If you talk with action rather than doubting intent you'll have a far better platoon overal.   In other words instead of: ""we could"" ""maybe"" ""we probably"".   Use: ""We are going"", ""we are moving out"", ""redeploy"", ""reinforce"", ""stack up"", ""Push out"".  Do not doubt yourself if you believe or even if you're uncertain in something but act out anyways. If it doesn't work out it just wasn't meant to be you loose nothing but gain a team that understands it perfectly. If you know you're going to get your guys farmed on assault then state it clear that you'll be trying to approach and take over the base within certain time limit. If success doesn't materialize just pull them off elsewhere. Everyone that way is on the same page and you sound like a strong competent PL.

PS2Cobalt,33xd78,halospud,2,Sun Apr 26 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"It's the problem of a three player game. Except it is factions, but still very similar. In the beginning you want to be as invisible as possible, but still aquire as good position as possible. In Ps2 that would equate to taking and holding hard to lose bases like indar ex, three point towers and the like, especially those that are chokepoints on the lattice as well. In m:tg three-way it is about not being agressive, both in attacking face, but also not ramping too much or drawing too many cards. You want to be the one that is not focused in the first part.  In the second phase of the game (alert) you want to make your move. You need to time it right tho. Too early and you receive backlash. Too late and well, you are too late. That's when you push for control, grab all the land without much thought (the kind of gameplay you requested in above post). Then your previous positioning and manipulation pays off. Then you can tactically overpop difficult to capture bases, while you are defending a biolab underpop.  This is the core difference between SS and alerts taken seriously. Alerts are a multiplayer (or rather multifaction) game and that is much more about manipulation of the opponents to do whats best for you rather than skillfully take territorial control.  We obviously have another facet with alerts. Communication, cooperation and coercion. Not particularilly ""mlg"" comms or anything, but using commandchat, /orders, /proxy to manipulate your teammates to do smart stuff. As well as making sure everyone follows a decent call rather than everyone following what they think is the best call. That sort of stuff. People skills. The thing NC cobalt is lacking. On a smash it can be a much harder reinforcement of comms of the more mlg variant."
PS2Cobalt,33xd78,taeerom,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's a game mechanic, it's more of a human behaviour to focus the guy who you see a the biggest threat. But if there was a more developped leading part then maybe great leaders could be able to foresee this kind of technique to keep the lead but that's unlikely"
PS2Cobalt,33xd78,Sotanaki,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:59:23 2015 UTC,I don't think that people really do that much.  It's more about the number of lattice connections and opportunities to attack.

PS2Cobalt,33xd78,Panserskolt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:21:31 2015 UTC,I would say it depends really. It's more reasonable to have 2-3 very defendable bases with 1 or 2 hexes of buffer to slow other two factions down before you need to redeploy rest of the troops in.  Rather than keep a loosing position from the start and wish for victory. It's also a good call to give up positions that would force other two factions on collision course.
PS2Cobalt,33xd78,RetOld,-1,Sun Apr 26 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, TBH I don't lead enough to have some experience and I'm sure it depends on many more factors than just percentage of territory control, but that's just something I see at many alerts"
PS2Cobalt,33xd78,Sotanaki,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:00:58 2015 UTC,"generally, staying in the background for the first half while securing major bases and abandoning those which the other factions can fight for ends well most of the times."

Vs on the other hand to play flawless."

PS2Cobalt,33pxy8,CptSonne,3,Sat Apr 25 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"Third one was horrendous. It's not even the ending either. It's the overarching main plot consisting of pure stupid.  I started the game and had bad vibe about it when they started revolving the story around the uber weapon you were supose to build. In my head i had questions about it's purpose and function and how it was tying into the story that was build up in previous two games. But the obvious was not staring me in the face just yet, or to be more precise i didn't believe that their writers had gone [FOOL]Retard.  If you remember in ME1/ME2 It was well astablished main arc that you're building up an alliance to fight the ultimate bad and then see that alliance deliver pound for pound equal or superior performance to the Re4pers. My view was that this was supose to culminate in third game ending with a massive ""all in"" do or die battle on all fronts where you travel around different difficult missions to pivot frontline stalemates in your odds.   The third game started well enough too. Your alliance forces got fractured because the enemy force disrupted comms and struck hard against indivual and weaker allies in sectors that were hard to reach or operate it. It makes perfect sense really and the game would work great if it was about you licking your losses and concentrating in bringing everyone who remains under unified command once more for a strategic counteroffensive. Knowing that from astablished facts from previous games that reapers didn't have the numerical advantage to take everyone on simultaniously.  But then crucible happened on every turn of the game and every plot point started to revert around building, babbysitting, loosing and finally fighting to get in and activate it at the end. Non of the people you befriended, saved or allied with mattered. They didn't become active partners in victory, they became the fuel with which you were supose to reach some sort of conclusions.  The saddest part is that with a little less bombastic and realistic approach the third game could have been amazing.   Imagine starting a game with a fractured force and 1/3 of your human not even the whole allied fleet under command of Hackett. Basically Fifth and remain of two others Fleets that were on the rearguard delaying action before this point. The Fleet command has given a go on abandoning Earth and all colonial worlds under threat. Moving remains of humanity deeper into Turian controlled space to regroup with the other strongest space centric force in alliance.    Your fleet arrives in the Turian space just as their frontlines get active and humanity has to shift from being refugees to fighting side by side to push off the advance fleets of Re4pers. By this point you've been scouting for survivors behind enemy line in previously human space and requesting electronic warfare ships with marine recon troop carrier ships to pick up anyone who survived. Mostly just fights for R/D instalations, scientific outposts and such. Jack's Xmen school for aspies mission and cerberus going full retard would be perfect for that. Cerberus being indoctrinated is also rediculous because TheInvisibleMan seemed smarter than that. Would be better if Cerberus would predict a pyrrhic victory and started picking up all valuable assets they could get their hands on instead so that once the war is over humanity would be in the leading position to become an space faring empire.  Once you arrive back in Turian space you're imidiately tasked at helping to seal a decisive regional victory against the Re4pers. Turian homeworld becomes the new citadel from which to strike back and organize vital tactical scale missions or strategic counteroffensives.   From this point it's up to you to do some of the genuinely well writen side arcs from the main plot. Like mending ties between Vanu Geth and Space Gypsies, getting that tasty Krogan BKNE zergs on your side and obviously helping Liara with a good dicking. Which could all tie up to softening the grip on reaper effected territories and their control of mass relays.  Strategic scale counter offensive would be securing network of planets and defensive grid around main mass relays in your closest vincinity. Preparing the ground for pushes on enemy conquered homeworlds or breaking Re4per zerg sieges from outside. Wouldn't mind few of those strategic operations being complete fuckups either where even with best of planning your end result is a loss. Fall of Thessia could be one of those where you have a mission to secure VIP's right from under enemy noses. Landing on surface with couple of divisions worth of expendable troops while your main space bound single fleet sized battlegroup keeps a coridor open. They clear out the airspace and relieve pressure on Asari in vincinity. The ships in orbit start doing massive bombardments in the area to keep the Reaper ground forces at bay but you know that you cannot save the world and work within very narrow timefrime. Before your fleet does a warpjump Hackett orders a scorched earth fire mission with mass deployment of nuclear weapons on planet surface. Something that he's already done on few human worlds in the past. Singifying that humanity is in this war till the last man and willing to sacrifice both allies and own people when it is required to so. Since Thessia was space murika with perfect democracy and shit it's end at the hands of it's allies would also be a large message that this war has resulted in end of democracy, economic well being and freedom. All that being sidelined in favor for military centric hardline control and solutions.   The end game would obviously be a huge battle spanning 2-3 large missions with everyone involved participating, your allies taking the brunt of it while you pinpoint key targets for them to strike in space fallowed by a final ground push. Culminating in either a feel good ending with everyone together or a proper ending with some people you send and yourself included never recovered, atomized into legendary status.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MlatxLP-xs watch this if you haven't seen it.

But the whole plot of first game was that Re4pers build the Citadel as a Command and Control hub for others to use untill they struck. So that when the time came they could pinpoint and beahead political and military leadership and gain intelligence information on both military assets spread throughout the galaxy, worlds under control of their enemy and isolate allies from each other by shutting down Relays. All this simply because they wouldn't be able to face an unified command as they lacked the raw numerical strenght to do so. Especially at the start before they would have the chance at indoctrinating worlds for their ground armies.  This was the picture i got out of the games. A very substentian and powerful threat but one that couldn't face numerical and industrial advantage of an unified allience or a large empire head on. Prothean records and dialogue from the game seem to also indicate that if it wasn't for Citadel they would have had combat parity against Re4pers on strategic level."
PS2Cobalt,33pxy8,Ometen,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:48:50 2015 UTC,Now I have to explain that I was joking and you ruined it.  The third game was so rubbish that I repressed all of the memories I have from the entire franchise.  It was like eating a Cornetto but instead of the solid chunk of chocolate at the tip there was shit.
PS2Cobalt,33pxy8,TheFatherlessChild,0,Sat Apr 25 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"It was a German joke obviously.  The third game have absolutely rubbish main plot, some of the sideplots were so so but few were really good and the ending basically made me loose all care for the series and where they will take it from here.  Also they made mai waifu into a a reverse tsundere throughout the series. Dissapoint."

I think mostly because ME1 & ME2 were just perfect (base on my opinion only) and the 3 was still good, but comparing the the 2 it's far from it. Also the ending of the 3.... They fucked up when they decided to make differents ending. That's just more  disturbing than anything else  Also the 3 is lacking from epicness. When you compare with the last mission of ME2 (Suicide Mission which was just...the most epic mission ever created for a game . But then again it's strictly personel. More interraction with the characters in ME3 would havemade it more enjoyable, but maybe it was on purpose just to notify you that you are alone on this last mission ?  Also have you heard about the Indoctrination theory? check it if not here  (Spoiler: That could explain why you see shepeard breath in one of the endings)"

Higher scopes almost makes the view weirder up close, you move your mouse left and right more trying to get him in line to shoot which makes it look even more fked up.   The vid in your thread he knew what he was doing + bit of lag   Bad connection or lag during that time will I crease the effect , it sill make it look ""not smooth "" With bad connection med kits can act fucking weird as shit to yoir benefit and longer you stay alive and spazz like guy I'm video"

PS2Cobalt,33pd82,SOLAR15,2,Fri Apr 24 18:02:04 2015 UTC,That's just standard sprint-strafing. Nothing unusual.  // btw notice he's on the slight incline and Forgelight makes player movement on inclines look super jerky and funny.
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,SOLAR15,4,Sat Apr 25 07:11:30 2015 UTC,"This is when you spaz around and exploit the shit netcode and and animation for running. If you do it with throttling you get the ""therum shuffle"" recursion ""movement meta"".   But it's hard to tell where on the scale someone is, normal connection just derping around, or lagging a bit and also doing the quick movements.  Imo, that has some degree of lag. Normally doing this gives smoother results with less travel between left and right, but still very fast movement and difficult to hit.  Your second description, where someone moves fast to a location a decent distance away from normal movements cabailitites - but doesn't actually warp - is a classic example of therum shuffling, though you don't have a video of that."
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,RememberMallory,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:35:04 2015 UTC,Second one was something like NIVX did in that video but in some larger distance (twice as large)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTVf59lk2A0
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,SOLAR15,2,Fri Apr 24 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is not normal, and there's no amount of spazzing to get you there either.  It is exploiting pure and simple."
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,Aggregationn,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"Hello, I played on 55 to 70 ping at that time in the vid and my connection is pretty stable from where I play usually, no delays, no sudden huge ping increases. As for the movement, i pretty much was doing exactly this http://www.twitch.tv/glorinfps/c/2168978 at the time in sparrs video, i was getting shot from 1 more person thats why he caught me already holding medkit and running around, also if you consider playing on faster sensitivity, with remembering correct move patterns and having good sense of area around you, i'm confident to say everyone can do this with mouse and wads+space buttons only, its mostly about timing and being explosive enough with changing directions."
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,RememberMallory,3,Sat Apr 25 02:08:22 2015 UTC,"I'm on my phone so I don't know who you are, and what you're specifically referencing.  But that Nivx movement is 100% not normal.  I play at around ~4 cm for a 360. I get that you can use high sens to spazz out running around but not on ADS. That is not related to the sensitivity since you're always facing your target and not flailing around. That is either genuine lag, exploiting connection quality/packet loss, or a cheat."
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,SOLAR15,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:35:00 2015 UTC,4cm?! Goddamn that's sensitive
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"friend, its me, Desk running around with medkit in the video sparr posted. The movement speed in this game on running is pretty damn fast as oposed to strafing so it would have been naive of me if i wasnt running and trying to juke zig zag incoming fire while trying to heal and reload, dont get it how running is exploiting, since hitboxes on sprinting are still fine and fixed ages ago.  That nivx movement is not normal because at the time, the movement speeds werent fixed when you would sprint or strafe and as well hitboxes/models on running werent good at all, now its much different since that stuff is fixed, especially the hitboxes, but some similiar bs can happen if the servers bad or the player is on 150+ pings with big delays."
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,Aggregationn,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:47:18 2015 UTC,Yea the comment you replied to was on Nivx. Above that I said it is hard to tell if people lag slightly or not. It could easily be explained by a biggish fight going on. For me it slightly outside of the norm but again videos make it hard to tell after all their frame rate is lower.
PS2Cobalt,33pd82,RememberMallory,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"Are the hitboxes really fixed though, because rapid movement seems to get me out of trouble all the time, as it does for enemies (especially at times of high server load)?  My personal favourite is when someone is adadwsws'ing on a slope or rocks, it's next to impossible to hit or be hit.  Not saying it's exploiting or anything, there's just something really off about the hitboxes when it happens imho."

PS2Cobalt,33oxmi,Lapfinou,2,Fri Apr 24 12:09:20 2015 UTC,Well there's lots you can try before getting a new one. First should be to remove all old drivers and and install new ones. Check the PCB for damage on the tracers. Flash the latest BIOS but you want to be careful with that since getting a BSOD during the flash would be bad to flash without any drivers installed.  What kind of temps are you getting on the card?  The last thing you could try is to cook it in the oven at 200-220C for around 10minutes.
PS2Cobalt,33oxmi,FishRoll,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"I did actually everything you listed here, except for the cooking lol. The max temp is around 69°C, so that´s fine. Nothing helped only switching the banks for the RAM was actually giving me 2 days without BSOD."

Only jumping them unaware as Infiltrator, flanking and height advantages as Light Assault or staying with buddies as Support classes.  It's not easy to beat a heavy when you are not a heavy and running straight at him while he's pointing his gun at you which is sadly where most of the complaints come from.  That being said I would rather the shield had a charge up of sorts. For example it starts at a small amount of resistance and builds up over a few seconds. So it can be used as a pre-emptive ability and not a crutch to fall on when you take the slightest bit of damage.  I fully expect all the scrublords to down-vote the idea of someone touching their royal highnesses mighty shield but ask me if I give a fuck."

If it is 1v1 class why does he have a launcher, why is he by far the best AV, AA, and Anti-MAX class as well as being IvI 1v1 class? How is this good balance?  I Do not accept at all your assumption that HA is 1v1 class by design.  Even if it was, that is still bad game design, and by definition OP. If there is 1 class that wins every fair fight against every other class, that class is OP.  Stop saying ""aim for the head"" HA can aim for the head just as well as any other class. It is a completely moronic and meaningless thing to say: ""If you significantly outskill the guy with substantial advantages over you, you can beat him = not OP""  You make zero convincing arguments, and paint a pretty crude straw man in this vid."

PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,pintle,2,Fri Apr 24 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"Well said , however people fail to see that its not just HA  , I agree with snashy , you and many others when they say that the entire class system is just plain broken or you can just call it bad game design .Some classes are not doing their job properly and some are over performing and have multiple combat roles assigned to them. Instead of balancing and making all classes combat viable they made one class ""universal anti everything ( best AA,AG,AI ) main combat class"" and other classes into mostly support (and somewhat very specialized) classes . Doing that in a ""glorified TDM"" such as planetside , will result in class overusage and eliminate the need for other classes to a certain extent , which is exactly what we have atm.  Other games did a better job when it comes to class balance and therefore had no problems with class over usage , or at least nowhere as near as planetside 2 has.You had to chose your role on the battlefield and whatever you chose you had a certain disadvantage , something with which other classes needed to assist you with  which is not the case here ( in most cases )."
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,RihnoSRB,-1,Fri Apr 24 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"The video was not about the heavy assault as a hole but about people who go head to head with a heavy and a surprised they lose. The video was to show that to win against a heavy assault on their terms you need to be much better and what i meant by that is that you should to do something completely different. HA should be cought with their pants down by light assault and infis not met f2f thats what i mean. Because from what i take it people play La, medic and infi as heavy assault , than they engage the real HA head on and are cyring that they are losing thats the point of the vid on the entire class balance but the shield and peoples mentality"
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,Aloysyus,2,Fri Apr 24 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"But that's literally the same argument as saying ""The Max is not OP because you can c4 it!"" I am not saying ""shield OP"" because at one point you are right: HA is meant to be the ""push forward"" class. But as many others said: the class system is broken. There is almost no point in playing anything else if not for the sake of playing something else.   The whole team/squadplay thing and the meta is broken. There is almost no such thing anymore as a need for mixed squad tactics. 3 HA, 1-2 infils, couple medics, 1-2 enineers, 1 max. No, you just get 6 HA and 6 Maxes, there is your winning squad.  And it it not only the HA itself: Facing HA (and maxes) constantly also gives other classes an advantage. You need longer to finish someone off, flee from him etc. That gives other classes the possibility to finish you off. Many deaths to maxes and HA are not in my statistics because some other class simply picked me off and you can clearly see on your video that you are down to 5-10% a lot of times even though you were constantly hitting the head.  Plus your habit of going into crouch mode very often is the very wrong thing to do against bad to average HA players because they don't aim for the head and you expose your head to their ""aiming area"" which is the middle of the body."

I threw myself into the most retarded situations, jumpin infront of enemies tryin to quickscope them n shit. Just because that was rewarding. That gave me adrenalin rushes. And trust me, there is absolutely NOTHING more frustrating than hiting that perfect headshot in a sticky situation, however you still die because he popped his overshield one second before you headshotted him.  And yes, it's my fault, I know. I chose the wrong class for the wrong engagement and I should have just sniped people from 9999 meters away because that's how the infil is supposed to play blablabla. And still everytime I hit those perfect headshots, everytime I do something that is probably most difficult to do in this game, I have a high chance of loosing the fight because he clicked one stupid button.

PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,BananenMatsch,2,Fri Apr 24 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"It's not just the overshield itself. It's about the heavy assault class. A few things to note what the HA is able to do.   HA has access to various shield ability types which grants you extra HP in a firefight against other classes. HA has access to LMG weapons with a ammo pool of 50-200 rounds HA can use nanoweave armor (20% increased resistance to small arms projectiles. Like the shield ability itself is not enough) HA has access to medkits/health restore kits HA has access to rocket launchers to encounter both Air/Ground   Heavy Assault just performs too well. You dont need a medic if you have medkits unless your dead because you want to save your K/D. You dont need a engi with a AV turret or a AV max to encounter enemy vehicles because you got dumbfire/lockons. You dont need a AA max to encounter enemy AIR because you got dumbfire/lockons. You got weapons with good DPS and accuracy paired with a high ammo pool, why would you use other weapons if you can use a LMG? Dont get me started about the betelgeuse. You can instantly get more health with a button press. Many people says its THE anti infantry class but thats not true its THE anti everything class. Holy shit even your fucking AV nades stick on vehicles/air and MAXes which is good but still totally overperforming."
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,AProfessionalAngel,3,Fri Apr 24 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"Nerf the overshield and you may see more class diversity, less K/D whores, more overall balance and the same amount of maxes. Cause fuck maxes. Nerf the shit out of them.  The current situation is obviously not only caused by the overshield. There's just not enough insentive to throw yourself on points or for class diversity. The only insentive that exists in ps2 is killing stuff and the guy with the highest K/D is the ""coolest"". Lot's of stuff has to change before people will stop caring about useless stats and just start to have fun playing the objective or playing rewarding/more difficult classes."
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,redpotion1,3,Fri Apr 24 15:03:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that the HA class is OP, but I don't believe the overshield is. Imo, the problem is that HAs barely need other classes around them to be effective. Engi ? Ammo is never an issue unless you dont pay attention. Medic ? If you're wounded, you've got medkits, and you can even dance your way out of tricky situations. And if you're a decent player, you can live long enough to rely only on a beacon. Also, respawning grants you full health, overshield and ammo. If you get rez'ed, you are vulnerable the next few seconds. LA ? useless. Infil ? need only one with motion sensor.  Make HAs less self sufficient, and you will get more class diversity."
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,nallar,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, used to play infil. Got angry at f-to-win-shield. Now I play heavy like everyone else.  HA straight TTK advantage scales up with skill. Other classes' utilities  don't - infil cloak will be spotted easily by decent players in CQC. Motion spotters are very strong, but once you've developed good situational awareness just aren't as useful as the overshield. Oh, and we've bundled in huge magazines so the heavy can take out a minimum of 4 people before needing to reload if they have good aim, without massive refire times."

Many claim its OP and I just can't agree and here is why.  Id like to make something clear here because a lot of people tell me that i just stated "" get gut""  My point was to say - the Heavy assault is the best thing for 1v1 on open field battles so dont be surprised that you lose fights like that. The shield seems op when you play against a Ha like you are one aswell.  If your not HA you shouldnt play like one and expect to take them out.  That was the point not to insult anybody. People need to understand that whether we like it or not the HA is the best thing for f2f endurance fights and you have to adapt to win against them. You cant just overpower them because its their role to do it. That was the point of the vid not to tell other people they are scrubs. I see many players trying to overpower a heavy which is designed to overpower all other classes face to face.   In short dont try to beat a heavy like your one aswell if your not. If you put into use this concept im sure HA will seem less OP.  Now truth be told this is just a conversation about the shield. whether the HA should have the option to engage everything is a different story but i was not talking about that.  If anything seems op about this class is the combination of shield and the God Mode medkits. Id like to see that changed but im not rly sure how."
PS2Cobalt,33pdnm,Ometen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:22:44 2015 UTC,"There is some really retarded posts on this topic on the main sub. It's been gone over a thousand times.  Most people moaning with the same old arguments of it forces everyone to play the ""one boring class."" and ""iWin"" shield are doing so because they want to play infiltrator or engie (lolwut?) 24/7, or because they think HAs shouldn't be able to round corners and take people on. In this thread you can see that same attitude.   The majority who play HA and still think it's dumb, don't actually do more than farm small, easy fights with cautious play and use the shield to crutch, and not engage 1vX. That's fine, loads of people do the same, but you need to understand you're using the class to the least of it's potential where it's strengths eclipse all other classes. Underneath that though, your muppetry is being propped up by other players at that fight providing detection, healing, ammo and other defenses. In effect you're being carried, you're being supported to allow your solo HA farming.   You also need to understand you're still going to be brushed aside by a mixed squad with a full range of infantry classes. Even if there's 12 of you all HA, all disparately farming in the same hex, and you group up, most fire lanes are too small for you to take advantage of 12 LMGs without killing each other, and even then we've just covered how you're a cautious, crutched-up pussy and not someone used to pushing the infantry line. Once one of you goes down you have no way of getting him back, you're healing is limited and requires you to be vulnerable, if you aren't VS you will need ammo at some point, you have no map-hack-detection-dildo, no turrets/mines. You're going to lose to equally skilled opponents. Not least because medic, LA and engie all have access to higher DPS weaponry that can offset the shield somewhat, 15-25% depending on weapon choice, not counting shotguns.   Most people saying HA is ""boring OP"", don't challenge themselves with it when they use it, or are basically playing solo but actually supported to do so by the other solo players in the hex, and not in an organised fashion. No one who's been in a tight-knit squad would think to roll all HAs in anything other than some relaxed farm time.  Then there's the ""iWin"" shield argument. Yes it's tragic that some HA shielded and turned around and killed you but, if you'd hit him properly with your blindside that wouldn't have happened. The flanking classes, LA and infil, both have weapons that can really tear up an unaware HA before he can even react. If you flank a HA and have some inappropriate support or low-DPS long range option - instead of CQC or alpha damage options, you are willfully doing it wrong, you deserve to fail. This part of the argument is a l2p problem, it always has been."

PS2Cobalt,33kyk8,taeerom,3,Thu Apr 23 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"You see TRID have two layers, a TS using core of experienced players who always squad up and play together, and (I love you guys so don't take this the wrong way) a lot of guys who're basically pubs with a TRID tag.

Trid can be pubs and randoms, many in trid play solo alot u know and we got shitloads of players, it is not like KAIN ,playing in groups most of the time, but when TRID pull maxes in organized teamplay it is to defend a base where NC dropped 96+ maxes or camping spawn with insane overpop and then its only fair to max crash it."
PS2Cobalt,33kyk8,Diskriminator,2,Thu Apr 23 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"Maxes has a time, place and strategic use. This feeling of maxes being unfair and statements ""it's fair to pull maxes if they do something cheesy"" is, I think, a contributing factor in why we are shit at SS now. We have a culture of playing fair and to look down on people who are not. No matter how fair it is to rush a point with heavies and medics, maxes do break out of spawn better. Is it more fun? Maybe not, but it is how to win."

PS2Cobalt,33kyk8,Sotanaki,3,Thu Apr 23 13:16:31 2015 UTC,"Stop the pointless accusations! Whoever has Hossin controlled it doesn't matter. That faction will pull tons of maxes and most of the times has extra world pop as well, it's logical as fuck. Just keep an eye on it and you'll notice. It doesn't matter if it is NC, VS or TR they all do it shamelessly and allways have a big advantage on the alert after. Oh, and if there is a faction that goes hardcore on making sure they win Hossin alerts than it's the VS. Because they appearantly have the highest percentage of players that actually understand how ridiculous OP this bonus is.  If we want to get rid of this, than go to the developers that brought this continent bonus. Either way, behaviour codes are not going to change a thing in this.

Miller pull a lot of maxes, and often more that cobalt do on live, but the difference on miller has always been squad cohesion.  You can have really good infantry fights with maxes involved and with tight knit squads as opposition, and that challenge is often more fun than solo clearing 12+ shitters on cobalt who have no organisation.

If HA would actually get nerfed obviously lots of other things would have to change (maxes and tanks eg), which is why they probably unfortunately never will get nerfed.

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,ZeusGotOrion,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"tbh i wouldnt mind that personally. But still i would have concerns that it completly throws of the balance. In a game with so many ppl you need a more tanky class to enter a room without getting instagibbed.   Playing a HA ""correctly"" is by far from easy.  Always be agressive, push, balance your normal shield against the abillity shield, Tank dmg for the medics, etc.The problem is not that the heavy is to strong IN MY OPINION. The problem is that the most players didnt really understand the reason of the class and just use it as a 1vs1 crash to boost the stats since nowadays everyone wants to be the superhero mlg player."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"All you say, maxes can do it and better than HA. So for the moment there is no way to play heavy like you said."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,taeerom,3,Wed Apr 22 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"ofc maxes are the upgraded HA and they are needed for the 48+ fights since the HA shield doesnt help you much if 7-20 ppl start shooting you at once. The HA is more like the MAIN infantry class.  It is made for combat and the other classes are support classes.  Infil = recon/distraction/unexpected angle  La = distraction/unexpected angle  Medic = healing  Engi = ammo/repairs  HA = tanking/killing  Max = Statpadding  Dont tell me that there is NO WAY to play heavy like i am saying, becouse i play it like that since over 2 years.  The core of the issue is that planetside isnt focused arround objective based, tactical teamplay where you need every class in order to make it work. Instead it is only about killing and farming. its a huge TDM. As a result of that everyone is going for the HA becouse he is clearly the best at doing this. By now ppl have noticed that maxes are even better at killing shit and that they can pull dem nearly endlessly and thats why we are having the problem with maxspams. This all comes down to the lack of ""metagame"".   SOE GIB META AND PROPER RESOURCE SYSTEM!"
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:32:52 2015 UTC,"My main infantry is heavy? Yeah, it was the first 6 months i played this game when i was a complete scrub. Nothing but Guass Saw, never even used a medkit, k/d barely at 1. I auraxiumed 2 LMGs and that's it.  People tend to get the statistic they want. I play mostly medic the last months.   And one more thing: I did not say you are not allowed to play heavy. I said there's countless guys who play NOTHING ELSE. And that is the problem. When a whole faction has so many more players who never even think about playing medic/LA/engineer once in a while then it gets frustrating. remember: last time i got the statistics like 2 months ago VS was at ~30% more max kills and around 35-40% (!!!) more LMG kills than the other two factions."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,2,Thu Apr 23 10:38:52 2015 UTC,""" 35-40% (!!!) more LMG kills than the other two factions."" this is just because of cyclone and jackhammer heavies being OP and that NC HA are scrubs and can't shoot. /s"

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Sightilicious,0,Thu Apr 23 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"Points about the scythe: 1. OP physics, you can literally ram every other esf without dying most of the time. 2. OP in 1v1 due to it´s frontal shape. 3. Best noseguns. Best velocity and reload as well as almost as good dps as the reaver. 4. Easy to jump, but it is still easier to jump a reaver. 5. The lack of speed is kinda neglectable, cause you can´t run away with the mossy from other esf as well, so it doesn´t really matter, as well as chasing cause it´s easy to lead, due to the high velocity."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Punisher_Ps2,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:26:42 2015 UTC,"IMO the craziest part is its shape, and for fighting with (almost) all ESF against all ESF, it's the damn hardest to hit.

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Aggregationn,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:00:54 2015 UTC,"It´s certainly no placebo effect, the saron is easily the best nosegun in game for an allround purpose.

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,TGangsti,2,Wed Apr 22 15:30:36 2015 UTC,no one denies that max spam is a problem! But you are generalizing a whole faction becouse of farming retards wich appear ON EVERY FACTION. And to be honest i would prefer to face 2 VS or TR maxes than 1 nc max...   Instead of pinpointing out vs as superbad adress the main issue wich is the max spam IN GENERAL. It doesnt matter wich faction is more retarded in that matter. Fact is the infantry play is not fun anymore becouse of that nonsense doesnt matter wich faction you play.
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"Adressing the main issue of the MAX spam in general won't let go the fact that VS spams them the most. Yes it happens everywhere, but more in VS. Now I dunno why : Is it in player's or outfit's mentality ? Are they better than the other MAX all around ?  In fact it's not the only problem I have with the VS but it's probably the biggest one."

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,2,Thu Apr 23 07:23:34 2015 UTC,I was always happy about TR not doing it. But the last couple weeks it increased imo. Maybe it is because of the new audiovisual styles.

PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,-2,Wed Apr 22 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"Tbh I know aloysyus pretty well and he is playing purely medic 24/7, when he is playing infantry, that gauss saw kills are all pre merge. If you would have scrolled down a bit you would have noticed that, but nah it´s too obvious to take those stats. He has obviously only medic AR´s with 1160 kills, cause he is going for the Gauss Prime. Could have judged that by the accuracy stats of each weapon.  In my opinion VS has too many maxes in general. Literally they have them in every fight, even in 1/12 fights, BUT their are mostly randoms playing max and they are the guys who are the max spammers."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Diskriminator,2,Thu Apr 23 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion VS has too many maxes in general. Literally they have them in every fight, even in 1/12 fights   I had a few incidents the past few days when busting skyguards. I usually immediatly break contact when encountering one to pinpoint it's position and then move in from behind. While doing so i came past a base 2 hexes from the frontline which had 1 or 2 guys in it. It took exactly 5 seconds to be opened upon by a burster max out of the spawnroom even though i clearly wasn't even heading for said base. The amount of this happening increased in the past few days.  Joke s on me though since i made him waste 450 225 nanites as i never came back there.  I feel like other than TR and a chunk of NC, VS needs no particular reason to pull maxes other than 'yay we zerged hossin at night again'"
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Ometen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:23:58 2015 UTC,"punisher ... every seasoned vs player knows that feeling as well and shares the hate against max scrubs. But saying ""hey tr and nc are so poor we only have to fight maxes and we do never pull maxes"" (ofc no one says that but this is how it comes across) is not really mature IMAO!  TR and NC would pull more maxes aswell if they could. Fact is vs owns hossin more often than the other factions do = more  vs maxes pulled."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,BananenMatsch,3,Thu Apr 23 11:53:36 2015 UTC,"I would like that they implement the timer for maxes again, and that you can´t cert it anymore. Like that you can pull a max only every twenty minutes or so. As well they should cost like 700 nanites."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,BananenMatsch,3,Thu Apr 23 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"It just needs a downside. Non-revivable, needs engineer support or it weakens, high costs, timer - whatever!  At last it can't spawn in galaxys/squad sunderers and can't use valkyries at all. Maybe they should invent special terminals for Maxes so you can't spawn them everywhere and need to be transported to the points you are fighting for."

And man - i have a BR100 VS as well. I don't insult anyone, there are very honorable VS players around. Does not change the fact that i run mostly into HA when fighting VS. I don't even mind when someone mainly plays HA, it is the stronges infantry class, why not get some kills? I will not stop playing HA at all myself, at some point i want the Godsaw. But i do play a lot of medic, i do play a lot of infiltrator.  But when so many players almost exclusively play HA then it gets ridiculous. Last numbers for maxes i have is this: www.reddit.com/r/PS2Cobalt/comments/2wd0b0/meanwhile_on_cobalt/copu6rw  Maybe it will be slightly different nowadays but you see the tendency?  Go and play NC/TR a bit more. You will see it.  And how do i deliver no proof? The statistics are there. I was kind of hoping that knoecherl would finish his stats page for that matter earlier but it seems like he is busy in real life."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,TGangsti,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:15:32 2015 UTC,"As a vs player i always run against shotgun nc players, get rekt by camping powlers or vulcan harassers, get instagibbed by nc maxes, mowed down by nc smgs from miles away... I could go on and on but i think you get the point. And this is completly fine to me! Every faction has its strenght and weaknesses. Planetside is a giant rock paper scissors game and that is what i like about it.   Imao it was a really poor decission to give vs the orian as standart lmg becouse it is more easy to handle than the other factions starting lmg´s. They should have picked smth like the flare IMAO!"
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Punisher_Ps2,2,Thu Apr 23 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"But this kind of ""balancing"" is dangerous. Wrel made a pretty good video about it: click  I dont like when people say ""You have the Raven, we have the Vulcan"" and such. Balancing should work amongst the same classes/vehicles. If you give the TR harasser this single Op weapon you will see tons of them - like you do. It is pretty obvious we have an imbalance there: click  So as an NC player who loves his Harasser it sucks for me not having a good counterpart. What does it help me when a Max player has his Ravens? the Ravens are OP as well and i am interested in having everything balanced.  What does it help me as medic player to have the jackhammer in my faction when i mostly face VS heavys?  Also the VS max is pretty much the same as the TR one - yet VS does use it so much more. You can ""imbalance"" everything with numbers. If the game does not really reward you for playing something else once in a while (in fact the Betelgeuse is so special it really rewards playing HA a lot) then a lot of players will continue playing the most easy way possible. In a real war i would support that but this is a game.  Yes i do farm myself, i play HA myself, i play MAX. But not all the time, not exclusively. This game has so much to offer, i want to experience it all and have fun while doing it."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,pintle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:39:49 2015 UTC,I agree with 98% of what you have written! Especially with this:   If the game does not really reward you for playing something else once in a while ... then a lot of players will continue playing the most easy way possible.   But what i dont like that you still see it as a VS exclusive problem wich is just not true.
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Punisher_Ps2,2,Thu Apr 23 12:55:30 2015 UTC,"Not the general balance problem, but i can just tell you that the HA and Max spam is a problem at VS much more than at the other factions. I mean we are not talking about the usual up- and downturns here, we are talking about 30%+.  And i hate it as well when NC spams maxes. I hate how incompetent most NC max players are (""F"" is for charge for Christ's sake! - not for standing in door frames.) Maxes stealing my spots, running in front of me and stealing my kills, place themselves close to my sniper with their annoying ravens. But they just don't do it as much as VS.  Take my video: It is totally fine to do a max crash sometimes. it looks awesome and epic, do it for the lolz. But VS did it again a couple mins later in the biolab. 20+ maxes on the map... and some guy in yell: ""I just saw 2 VS maxes"". At some point it's just enough."
PS2Cobalt,33h0m2,Spartancfos,2,Thu Apr 23 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"I would say: NC: GD-22S, VS: Pulsar LSW, TR: T9 Carv for the starting lmgs of each faction."

You need to kill each targets 2 times. Once with a sidearm and once knife kill. Dont cheat Open end contest. It will end until someone has won.   Tips for the targets:   Avoid running around alone. Play in a group if you can. Avoid big fights if possible.   Just some tips you dont need to consider them.  If you got a target kill DONT FORGET TO TAKE A SCREENSHOT INGAME OR FROM THE PLAYERSITE KILLBOARD.  Send the screenshots either to fdus1000@googlemail.com or post them here.  One more thing.  dont  dare  to cheat!

PS2Cobalt,33cm59,Cariol,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:30:11 2015 UTC,"Well I suppose the protection from the air is the main reason you would want a cloaked sundy (since you would probably not place it in a garage). I, for one, think it is a good thing, since it add some tactical depth to spotting sundies (air units need a spotter on the ground). I agree though, Hossin seems like the perfect place to deploy one of those."

PS2Cobalt,33cm59,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Now that I deinstalled the game they start bringing in cool features, wtf.  I did like to place stealth sunderers so seeing this feature getting implemented I'm really happy. Stealth sunderers were good if placed for small squads to hack the vehicle terminal of an enemy base and then flank them with tanks from behind as an alternative to leaving a spawn beacon there. However, even with being not shown on the map you were an easy target for air and smaller vehicles just passing by. They would still spot you no matter what after some time. The cloaked sunderer seems like an awesome alternative if you put it somewhere offside a base and roads, but it will most likely be the death for the stealth sunderer. But this depends how effective spotting of these sunderers will be with and without scout flash on live. Nevertheless, I see the most potential with 1-2 squads in less populated fights were you can guarentee that the enemy cannot figure out immediatedly where the sunderer is situated. Maybe you need to lock the vehicles too to stop players from exposing your sunderer."

PS2Cobalt,33cm59,pintle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think it is brilliant.  Small squads can be smart about attacking and the dome means you can hide a moment to prevent you being seen.  The problem is if and when random shitters spawn in and give you away but this is a big fuck off to the libs roaming around late at night who kill fights before they start, and I like that."
PS2Cobalt,33cm59,Oliver_Closeov,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:46:22 2015 UTC,If they can make spawning on a cloaked sundy restricted to Platoon/Squad only it could be allot of fun :)

PS2Cobalt,33cm59,PTMC-Cattan,3,Tue Apr 21 14:17:24 2015 UTC,The second one. You can restrict access to the turrets from publics so I guess thats good. But the train of people coming from 1 spot will definitely blow its cover.

PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Cornelisatorus,3,Sun Apr 19 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"I might get unwanted hatred from air and ground guys after this but everyone is giving their feedback and so will I. My feedback would be centered around my role as a regular pilot and i will give little feedback about rest of the aspects. I don't think i am competent to judge our ground play if i only seen it from above.  Air stalemates  I want to say i am glad those are almost gone. This is something that we've improved. In emerald match we were engaged in the starring contest for whole match. Thanks to the charlie squad (much love, saved my ass several times out there, charlie squad-best air squad) we were quite aggressive and air battles were resolved quite quickly.  Air play  This is somehow new flaw, yet the big one. After emerald match we were so engaged into winning the air battle that we... forgot what to do with such win.  Our orders to provide pounding to the area were quite sluggish in my humble opinion. And we did not quite coordinate. We were sent to bases too late or unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, those were occasional mistakes not regular occurrence but it was visible. Something to improve i think.  Moreover, we were in my opinion too concentrated on fighting a2a. Every time there was any enemy air presence everyone gone up in the skies. I think that we should be more sacrificial. Several bases could use additional 20s of ground pounding even if that means whole squad of scythes killed. I know, it may sound crazy but this is exactly what many guys said about ground. Air should push for the ""A"" as well imho.  Air focus  I think that air got too distracted by enemy formation. My squad was only once sent to western front. After our arrival we did killed bunch of reavers and libs and begin to provide ground support. But then we were called of back to Nason's to counter enemy air. And on the map i've seen that other squad from eastern front was called back as well. To be fair, i don't know if this was mistakes and certainly cannot say that it was bad strategically decision. Yet it felt like i was abandoning our groundsters and criticize me or not, i was there to help them win, not other way.    Miller did lost the air battle but then they adapt. They divided their forces and just sent them to every front. If we appeared there we wiped them but we called entire platoon to do this. It took 6 of their guys to shatter our ground forces with air but it took our entire platoon to wiped them up. And they had such forces everywhere. Even if we win on 2 bases, they still covered 6 more. And Hossin lattice made it possible. Maybe on Esamir their  air guerilla tactics wouldn't work but on Hossin 1 or 2 reavers under the trees worked too well. At least that is my POV. I might be mistaken.  A2G mistakes  This is the little issue and i admit that i've noticed it only after watching stream. We were too focused on bombarding A points and ignored the forces blocking our defensive rush. This is small mistake and i am guilty of it as well. We should give support to our advance troops more.  Enemy spawns  Just as said by OP, i've seen too many enemy beacons and sundies i was totally unaware of.  This is it. It is only personal feeling. I don't know what was the big picture."
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,RachitynowyJoe,3,Mon Apr 20 08:00:03 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because from the Miller air side of things, it didn't feel like we lost the air at all. Our objective was to win the match, not to farm or win air engagements. And i was able to have all my 4 air squads up through the entire match, and was able to have my guys at almost every single base we needed to be at, to force it through (except for Ixtab and sometimes Nasons and some eastern bases).  My strategy for the match was to throw our entire air ball at you a few times in the opening, letting you guys think we would do that the rest of the match, hopefully getting you to overreact in the future. Then we would split up our airforce. I would throw 2 squads against your ball in the middle several times, knowing it was a losing fight, but their only objective was to tie down your airforce, while having a squad in the east and a squad in the west providing crucial air presence when bases was about to flip. And later we would have 6 guys of air at almost every single base that was at the 1 minute mark, while we had you guys tied up trying to engage our remaining air all the way north at the bio lab way past the frontlines. Also we had a comms officer in the air platoon doing nothing but communicating the location of your air force and burster nest, so it was almost a non issue in regards to our redeploy side. People knew where they could bring galaxies, and when to send a racer Reaver with a beacon to get around.  If your air had been more of a problem for our ground guys achieving their objectives, we would have changed up our tactics to a more confrontational style, forcing you to worry more about us than farming the ground.  I don't want this to come of as some sort of rant, just wanna give you guys some perspective.  All my guys had a bunch of fun this time around, the no Tomcat agreement (even though broken a few times) was amazing. So thank you all for putting up a great fight in the air! GG"
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,SebABTF,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:36:43 2015 UTC,your guys broke it also a couple of times but ....it was like maybe 2-3 lockons in the entire match :)  But that is still amazing cheers for the amazing air fights
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Sovano1,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"And that was my feeling as well. I am not saying you were devoid of air presence. On the contrary, i was trying to conclude that your guerilla tactic (i am obviously not native english- guerilla is small groups in many places for me) was supreme in that situation. I was not stating if this was intended or not if so then i congratulate you.  i cannot say anything about your strategy because i was only a regular pilot. My analisis was only from cobalt side. I am satisfied that at least your formation was understandable for me :D  I must admit that i am dissapointed that AA nest was not so serious threat afterall. It did feel like one from my pov. But you have better perspective on that and thanks for the feedback.  I am glad that things i pointed out were actually planned and executed. I must congratulate you because obviously your force played cobalt in that field.  on the side note, i think cobalt needs to step up our platoon game. We are pridfull of our individual skills but it didn't paid off against brigs, emerald and now miller. Especially now when even mediocre pilots needs to be commisioned (like myself). Yet i can say big words but without giving the solutions it is fruitless"
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"Also, that we played on Hossin played a huge part in the success of using guerilla tactics. If it had been any other continent, we would have done it differently.  Your AA nest definately did damage to us, but i'm not sure if it was more effective than have 12 additional pilots. If it wasn't because Briggs had done the same to us last match, so we had a plan in place if you would do the same, you AA might have been a way bigger problem. But it did succeed in zoning us out of the Ixtab area when i wanted to go there.  Again, thanks for a great match! it was a lot of fun"

PS2Cobalt,335u5k,AlphaRastor,3,Mon Apr 20 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"From the Miller West lane perspective:   I hardly saw Cobalt A2G. There was some at Bitol Stockpile while we were sitting at the point, but thanks to the good cover there, all it did was denying the ability to clear up the area a bit quicker. Not really a dramatic impact. I hardly died to LPPA/Photons. Bad population management/redeployment speed. There were quite a few times where 24-48 VS were 30 seconds behind or sitting on a point (e.g. Iron Quay) for even longer without having the ability to have an impact on the map. Leap-frogging is really powerful if it works, but it did not seem to do so for you. Trickling waves. There were some nice, concentrated pushes, but mostly we could pick off single targets or small groups. I saw a lot of Gals dropping 2-6 guys at a time all over the place. Easy to defeat, especially if the drop was directly on the point with no way for you to get organized. Destroying Sundies. Our AMSs usually stayed up pretty long, without tanks/battle buses harassing them. If they came they were usually too late. Force multipliers close to points. There was one Sundy at Rusty Bent Glave that was a bitch to take out and made me put all my nanites into tank mines. Apart from that there was a distinct lack of MAXs and Vehicles around control consoles. The MAXs seemed to usually get taken out on the way on be left there. The MAX crashes that occured usually took the direct route to the point. Necessary when every second counts but you exposed yourself way too often. Spawn containment. When you were attacking a base most of the VS were concentrated on the point. If you have good communication it's pressure the spawn room and teleport with most of the forces while having some people have an eye on the flanks for quick call outs. Meanwhile we could push you back pretty well. I agree with OP about the ""People did not push the point when they needed to"" point. Too little, too late, even though you often had the population to save the outpost.   GG, WP. Keep at it, hopefully you can rise to form again."
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Jamahl17,2,Mon Apr 20 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"Trickling waves. There were some nice, concentrated pushes, but mostly we could pick off single targets or small groups. I saw a lot of Gals dropping 2-6 guys at a time all over the place. Easy to defeat, especially if the drop was directly on the point with no way for you to get organized.   That was definitely also a problem I noticed in the center. There were a lot of lone wolves and half-squads trying to break our full squads covering points at Nason's Defiance and they constantly got a bloody nose until eventually we ran out of revive grenades or some other squad came in to help them in an organized push.  Even 0.1 K/D outfits can do squad cohesion if they try (and they'd probably perform much better afterwards). Having non-infiltrators running around on their own is not acceptable in a ServerSmash unless they are maybe trying to scout out resistance and then you follow up with a real push.   The MAX crashes that occured usually took the direct route to the point. Necessary when every second counts but you exposed yourself way too often.   While MAXes were rare in the center, opponents always took a very direct route as well without regards for firing lanes. In FRMD we went through the bases we would fight over in our preparation and looked at which routes were the safest. It took maybe 5-10 minutes per base and should really be part of minimum preparation.   Meanwhile we could push you back pretty well. I agree with OP about the ""People did not push the point when they needed to"" point. Too little, too late, even though you often had the population to save the outpost.   Yup. You can't save a base by killing anyone you see through the doors, at some point you have to get in and get yourself killed so the rest of your team can secure the point. The PLs and SLs have to organize those and squad members have to follow it, even if it destroys their K/D wit a 5% chance at actually succeeding in the resecure.  My summary from that match was: Cobalt has plenty of good players that can easily kill me in 1v1, but the squad cohesion and organization is lacking. A good K/D is easy to get, even my Cobalt Alt has 2.74 because I only fought in ""good fights"" farming scrubs. Having a good squad that sticks together and does whatever is necessary to succeed is hard."
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Pleto1,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:54:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your input. Regarding your first point, i also felt that the western lane was neglected way too much by our airforces. Most of the time i checked the map, a large quantity of our airsquads were focused on the middle/eastern lane. As i described in my post, i got farmed by a lib while fighting in the western bases. Whenever i was fighting at the middle or at the eastern lane something like that did not occur."

I saw group of infantry just pass by the beacons and no fucks were given ..had to take them out myself. even as I went with my lib to kill some libs and a valk ..reavers ganked me and scythe who were close by did nothing. Ofc I'm not talking about my platoon ..my platoon was actually doing well ..we took out sundies that we encountered and gals and all. But as you said, maybe if other sundies orrr anything that would have required air support was properly addressed ..the air could have helped more."

Sadly, noone seemed to bother with the beacons.   Funny you mention that as this was apparent in the last SS with Emerald vs I think Miller. I wonder if it is because a lot of us infantry peasants have Particles off, or still set at low and 0.0000. If so, the beacon does not render its beam, and in heat of battles is hard to look on maps to tell whats what. Just something I noticed, and seemed strange in the last SS."

PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Spitcat,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:14:08 2015 UTC,"Destruction of the spawn options  So true, so goddamn true. Why the fuck nobody cares about that. That's like the first most important thing you do to cut enemies from coming back into the fight, except of course you priotorize farm instead of actually defending or capturing a point. I was playing in the mid so I cannot speak for the western front. Now I regret not redeploying over there to take a look for myself like wtf happened. I can only suspect that the enemy air destroyed all our defensively deployed sunderer as soon as they arrived, and that the enemy air stopped them from reaching the point or clearing out enemy beacons. I really hope that was the problem cause the alternative saddens me even more."
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,PigOverloard,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"I was playing in the eastern lane, which got far less crushed, so it's hard to relate to everything you say. However, I believe you're right, because we experienced all this (admittedly to a lesser degree). Our coms were solid but my squad (PTMC) was alone most of the time, even when hopelessly outpoped. We did get reinforcement sometimes but it was often too late, and I think this is related to the zerging you pointed out."
PS2Cobalt,335u5k,Aloysyus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:12:32 2015 UTC,"about the air, hossin is a totally different story to esamir, there are like 5 lanes at most, and you can cover 3 at the same time with 1 air ball, but hossin on the other hand has like 14 lanes or something crazy, not to mention the awful visibility and the trees making it impossible to cover more than 1 at a time.  Another thing iv been trying to point out in the air is that miller did not have an airforce, that or they were just shit because i did not see an air fight after the first 25 mins of the game.. it was all just random revers flying around making it veryyyyyy hard to counter with just 1 air ball because of the way the new resources work, before the change the airball would just bleed the small groups dry and stop them from spawning esf's.  In other words servers have stopped trying to beet us in the air in direct conflict because, I remember the older ss games every airforce would talk shit before the game and hype them self up and we would be sitting outside there warpgate after the first 5 minutes of the game and have them empty of resources.  What miller did was smart.. they just didn't fight us, emerald kinda did it in the first game of the 2014 championship's and beet us.. the fight for 25 mins then just pulling air when they wanted to.. maybe with an airforce or maybe just ground platoons [ask them idk]  In my opinion I think we need to re-think how our air is used and Id LOVE to get some people from the cobalt high command and some good pilots to try and work something out in a ts or something."

PS2Cobalt,335i6j,Nerfav,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:41:01 2015 UTC,"For 1v1, this old point system is pointless. Because the closer you are from a warpgate, the more the bases are valuable for the A faction and the less for the B. Do you see what happen ?  For score difference, all the bases worth the same, since you don't necessarily take a lot of points, but you remove tons of them for the enemy (the increasing loss of points for the enemy exactly compensate the decreasing win of points for your team).  And I am afraid we won't see lots of terrans during this Ops."

PS2Cobalt,335i6j,Ometen,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"This Ops applies to all factions. NC and TR leadership will also be on Trid TS, we are setting up accordingly. Also so far more NC are signed up than VS, and no TR as of yet :) Edit: Reread your reply, what I mean is that each outfit fights for their faction, thus (hopefully) creating the even fights. Signing up is so Trid can prepare our TS aaccordingly and to correctly distribute bragging rights ;)"
PS2Cobalt,335i6j,Ometen,2,Sun Apr 19 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, we were misled. I thought we would have to create VS characters.  Afaik, NC outfits prefer to share the same platoons, according to their social and gameplay proximity with other outfits for those type of operations. And from my experience, it would be more interesting to only have teamspeak-only squads.  But it's not incompatible with your organization, the NC organization could be slightly different from the other ones.  Again, I speak only for myself and if there is a NC who disagrees, feel free to tell it."
PS2Cobalt,335i6j,Cariol,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"It's more about getting the leaders on to a single TS server. Sharing platoons is fine I just need the PL and SL names once you've organized. Our squads are usually also all on teamspeak, but Tridents server can't really hold all players participating in this event, and comms would get more complicated. This is basically a test, if it works well we will organise more in the future, so we haven't optimized everything just yet :)"
PS2Cobalt,335i6j,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"Having PL and SL on one teamspeak and players on another is a pain for the SL. Trust me, we already did that with FACS, and at the end, their officers were exhausted. I don't think many SL would be ready to do that.  One solution would be to use the Jesters Teamspeak for the NC, and RIMG or RMIS for the TR. Maybe you should coordinate with JEST and RMIS for this Op."

PS2Cobalt,335dvu,BananenMatsch,-6,Mon Apr 20 02:12:58 2015 UTC,I dont agree with that because it requires skill and aim to play with a PA unlike HAs with betelgeuse/godsaw or maxes or even ppa.
PS2Cobalt,335dvu,Punisher_Ps2,3,Mon Apr 20 08:11:14 2015 UTC,Ah ok then you have auto aim on the betelguise and all HA and max weapons right? PPA is hardmode.
PS2Cobalt,335dvu,Diskriminator,2,Mon Apr 20 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"I dont think that i said that the LMGs and MAXs got autoaim on them. HAs are simply overpowered with their shield ability in infantry play and it does not make it better if they spam use medkits. Dont get me started on the MAX because you know it yourself. MAXs are the worst things in this game and beside farming other players there is no real other use for this class. Everytime i fight VS there are only heavies with betelgeuse (clearly a overstatement because there are also heavies with orion/SVA etc.). I tested myself VS heavy with orion/SVA/pulsar and it's true the weapons feel much better, the 1x scope is clear and you have free sight just overall it feels great. I have way better runs if i play my VS char compared when i play TR. Betelgeuse is simply a OP weapon and the fact that you have unlimited ammo if you play it correctly is just horrible. With a pump action you need to have good aim otherwise you are pretty much dead if you miss your first shot. I can confirm that and many others who used PAs can confirm it aswell. Also you need to be pretty close to your target to be effective with it, on long range it is like throwing cotton balls on your enemy unless you are using slugs.   And PPA hardmode? wtf?"

PS2Cobalt,32u8p2,elbifo,4,Fri Apr 17 05:31:16 2015 UTC,Look also on his directives and accomplish times  in example - max air deterrence he made 3tier @2015-04-10 19:03 and 4Tier @2015-04-10 21:15  from 450 to 1200 in 2 hours ?

PS2Cobalt,32u8p2,schumuchen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:09:08 2015 UTC,Prompt Critical has already seen it and responded in the main Planetside subreddit. He can basically kiss all his directives goodbye.  I heard they run a script from time to time that checks for kill repetitions and flags it if over a certain threshold.  I believe one of the devs mentioned it some time ago. Guess they just haven't ran it in a few weeks.

As for your housemates/friends If they are using torrenting software such as uTorrent or Bittorrent feel free to educate them on how to limit their upload rates on the software which would free up a huge amount of bandwith for everyone else (I had a similar issue with people uploading).  I would point at that not to long ago a French player was banned from Planetside 2 due to his bad connection and lag. This sub was in general quite cheerful to hear of such news. Its not the first time someone was banned for lag and I believe it was permanent so you may want to prepare yourself for that."

It's things like facebook, youtube, email and dropbox/wetransfer; uploading big files through your browser can't be throttled, except with special software on your computer, and we've only got 4mb/s: more than enough for the two/three casual gamers, but it all gets hogged by a browser uploading a bunch of photo's. It only happens every few weeks, so it's acceptable (or so I thought). Thought about using ""Gargoyle"" firmware, but it doesn't look like it'll work with our modem.  Being permanently banned wrongfully would be painfull; my subscription just auto-renewed last week... maybe I should tweet an active dev; got any advice as to how I should go about that?

You were several times stopped by the tankmines and loads of infantry.  You can maximize your time to reach objective(killing enemy spawns) by moving onto the mountain to the east(one guy done it and maybe i am mistaken and you ordered it and if so, sorry). It is perfect sweet spot to not only kill all of their sundies but to support(farm) enemies inside from elevated position if friendly infantry is not doing well.  I like the synchronization you get from dictating targets. Sound and looks satisfying :D"

It´s the usual main infantry combat class in PS2, so why would you run around, for example with engis instead, cause they are meant to be support not the main inf vs. inf class.  I will never get those guys who say ""ah fucking heavy spamming shitter"". The heavy is probably a bit too strong, but that´s DBGs thing to fix it. And yeah to the guys who say heavy is fucking OP, learn to aim and use the right tools in the right situation."
PS2Cobalt,32mvh6,pintle,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"Generally in my experience people do not mind HAs existing so much. What annoys people are the career HAs who smack talk while farming in defence/underpop. The people who think a good HSR/KDR/acc with LMGs makes them great at PS2.  The less viable your spawn, the more you need medics. A medic is a psuedo-spawn point. An HA is ""a guy that can kill things"".  You can only get away with an HA heavy squad comp in situations where you have an easy/safe spawn, or in large organised groups (24+).  HA has a role and a place, but if you are backcapping a zerg and living off of a rotating SL beacon, it is a luxury that removes 1 potential revive guy from your squad, and the only unique utility it provides is anti max. If you are point holding underpop with shotgun medics (AIP/ 2013 DHMR style) you cannot run HA because you need to revive. Most of the people who will try to argue against this have not tried it.  Not saying you don't need HA in SS or w/e. But for getting shit done on live against zerglings, medic is the point hold class.  HA is a cost free force multiplier that accentuates the advantages of overpop. The more secure your spawn options, the more you can spam the class that ""just wins fights"".   Some people only play HA and think they are good at this game, I find that sad/funny.  Personally I have no problem with career HAs per se. I do, however, find the proportion of the community devoted to farming stats on a VS HA pretty depressing. I honestly do not get all the guys that think farming ""good"" IvI stats in this game is 10% as rewarding as getting good at CS:GO or some other team balanced/session shooter.   And yeah to the guys who say heavy is fucking OP, learn to aim and use the right tools in the right situation.   What is the right tool? More HAs? Would you say the same thing about Tomcats? :)"
PS2Cobalt,32mvh6,halospud,3,Wed Apr 15 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"I'd love to argue with you over what makes a good player in this game, but it's a class game and not cs:go, so essentially a good player is one who can play a class well, and a great one is one who can play all classes well.  People who smack talk in yell are just internet background noise though, and are the exception usually.    It's a strange quirk of this game that the main fighting class is often put down as ""unskilled"", but that's the internet for you and perhaps an indication of this community's average FPS experience imho.  People who talk down heavies are generally people who can't play heavy, or who think we're playing a different game.  HAs with good stats are generally good/great players though, and while I do kinda cringe at any circle jerk over stats, stats do show who's good at what.  Having said that, most stats are inflated because we run into so many players with the intelligence, situational awareness, and positional sense of bots.    You can only measure how good you are when you come against other good players/squads, but in the meantime the only way I can personally keep myself challenged is to find under pop and fight there, whether that be in defence or attack, it doesn't matter, although we all know attacking is much harder. I would even argue that 50-50s and slight overpop are often justified depending on the level of your opposition, because attacking is so difficult (especially with randoms around you).  Anyway enough on that.  A much more interesting point is the medic setup in a squad (you'll notice in ours we have three out of 8 players - which is partly why I thought the later abuse we received was ironic), as I disagree slightly with regards to your assessment.  A medic ball is only as strong as it's weakest link because once you kill one, you are taking him and the guy ressing him out of the fight for a few seconds, and good squads will dismantle it pretty quick by keeping the pressure on.  It is rare to see a medic ball work these days, if the opposition are any good.  Those groups who do use them get away with it most of the time, but it is the teamwork and tactical positioning which wins them the day more than the fact they are all medics.   That said, each to their own, and there is no right or wrong way in this game.  Shotguns and maxes are cheese, most will agree with that, but there are also no rules in planetside, and they are just as much part of the game as ppa scythes or HE prowlers. It is the game we play, so we accept it, like we accept light assault tower farmers, ai aircraft, and anything else in this game that I personally rank as cheesier than HA.  What keeps us playing is probably the most important point here, it's about setting your own meta, and for many small groups like ours, that is about the perfect play at the squad level, when comms are efficient, we are challenged individually, and overcome it with teamwork.  I have never played a game which serves up as many opportunities to do that, so often, as this one.  You set yourself up and drill your team to deal with as much as you can with as little manpower as possible, and for some groups pump actions work (insert favourite class here, all cheese IMHO), for others medic balls, others Max spam followed up with engies and medics, others use a mix.    At the end of the day though, it all boils down to what you achieve against all the above which dictates which option you should use for your group at anytime, along with how many of you there are and how many you're up against.

Takes a tiny moment. Communicating ""safe/not safe"" and working revives is a huge part of the skill of medicballing, or playing medic in general.    good squads will dismantle it pretty quick by keeping the pressure on.   Most zerg back caps over the past 2 years have not been wiped by ""good squads"". Can count the times that has happened on one hand. It gets wiped by either multiple MAX units or a human wave.   It is rare to see a medic ball work these days, if the opposition are any good.   Hence me making the distinction between SS play and live. It works on live precisely because people are not very good.   Those groups who do use them, get away with it most of the time but it is the teamwork and tactical positioning which wins them the day more than the fact they are all medics.

Communicating ""safe/not safe"" and working revives is a huge part of the skill of medicballing, or playing medic in general.   I agree with the comms thing, but I personally see rez grenades going off in a medic ball and think free kills.  It does of course depend on the squad using them, as for example INI elite on Miller (back in the day) and (FOG currently), do it much better than most on Cobalt, and while the likes of RMIS (and to an extent BMGP) can do it well on their day, I think both are better when they have a more balanced squad composition including heavies.  DHMR do it well without shotguns these days, but their numbers are generally pretty small and I rarely see rez nades.    It's all checks and balances, but because (as you say) you are normally rushed off a point by MAXs etc, is precisely why medic balls are 2013 tactics.   MAXs are so spammable these days you have to deal with the spam even in 1-12's, and C4 can only carry you so far because it doesn't have the range.  Last month for example we had a smallish TR squad on Amerish (with 70% overpop), rush our squad of 3 heavies and 1 infil with two waves of maxes engies and medics (I counted 4 maxes on the final push).     Hence me making the distinction between SS play and live. It works on live precisely because people are not very good.

I think there is only so far you are ever going to get in underpop, and what you say about MAX availability (coupled with repeated squad spawn/beacon nerfs) sets a fairly hard limit on it, but I still think if you really want to squeeze the most ""pressure"" out of your better infantry players as possible, you make them backcap medicball with PAs in only-just-not-ludicrous underpop. I think that it is the position in the game where good fps play can gain the most leverage."

I can't disagree with this, because it works a lot, but I will always advocate a mixed squad over medic spam, and heavy spam over medic spam (provided you have a spotter and some security over your spawn - I hope that cloaked sundy is for real! http://i.imgur.com/4AS8iCt.jpg).  I think you have to consider the numbers you have available though, because specialisation requires numbers.  The all round class is HA, and that is pretty much why, in a nutshell, that I main HA, and also why you'll often see 3 or 4 of us cutting about as HAs together.  When you hit higher numbers, like in the woodman ase video above, we can branch out, but otherwise we'd need much more than 4 or 5 guys at once to make a medic ball work in the fights we tend to go for."

PS2Cobalt,32mvh6,Aggregationn,0,Wed Apr 15 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"just grab an LA and flak them   Map design precludes this in many cases. Air control makes this highly situational in its viability. ""Just grab LA and flank"" smacks of someone with way more HA playtime than LA.   or use in CQC the balanced shotgun or smg to get higher dps   HA can use these weapons.  Even with higher dps (with the accompanying range/accuracy/reload disadvantages) HA still has more health.  Equipping the same weapon as a guy with more HP than you is not a counter.  Having more DPS is not the same as ""out dpsing"" someone. That depends on factors like having more hp. Cycler TRV vs Orion is not a clear cut case.  ""l2headshot"" does not work when he does the same back at you.   even tho I don´t really like tomcats and shotguns   You missed my point there :)"

To become one of the best PS2 players I have met you would need to:   Get ESF fundamentals down pat Become a walking force multiplier: look outside your own combat environment and start thinking about leader chat, prox voice, getting zerg spawns up, and when creeping the zerg forward as medic is more useful than farming bads as HA. Fly more, seriously. Start investing your considerable skill in training the newer/weaker players around you.   I know I am repeating myself and probably come across as a patronising arsehole, but those openRA games with you really made me see you are so much more than a career HA, and that you are one of the few people capable of making the live game soooooooo much more fun and challenging, so yeah, alcohol made me write all this shit in the hope you go all tryhard and make Cobalt a more awesome server than it already is."

Secondly, are you not aware of the 3-4 months I spent just flying constantly back on Ceres? I had KIZZZZ train me in some ESF fundamentals and I was on a pretty reasonable level (Could beat most pilots except for aces). The only problem was that I didnt really get much enjoyment out of flying, not to mention that the airgame was pretty toxic.  And in terms of training people I would be glad to, its just that no one ever asks me anything about infantry play mostly due to the fact that i'm not really well known on the server. I would train people, if people asked me to train them ;P  And as for dealing with zergs......I did that enough back in my TFDN days.   The result is that it all just boils down to what is enjoyable for me. Small scale squadplay, infantry only, playing HA are all things I enjoy in PS2 and after trying everything else (Leading platoons, tanking, flying) I am honestly hard pressed to find reasons to leave my ""Comfort Zone"" of a playstyle.

You guys are one of the small groups we run into a lot and always stand out as tight knit and a challenge, so any content you put out would definitely be worth a watch.  It has always been my feeling that the devs have focused too much on the large scale clusterfuck generation side of things in this game, and they market it that way, so it is up to us players to show where they're going wrong IMHO."

PS2Cobalt,32mvh6,Xaniy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"It's their only selling point. Other games are much better for small scale.   There's a subtle difference.  Other games balance numbers on the small scale, and within those games you have those awesome plays where you take on 3, 4, 5 guys solo (for example) but these are rare compared to PS2.  This game's marketing has always focused on those massive gal drops, tank zergs, 500 people rushing across an open field etc, when the actual good game (imho) is at the squad level where you can fight against odds which can be of your choosing (eg in defence) or which can fluctuate madly (eg redeployside).    A lot of the design decisions have screwed over the small squad players, but there is still a game there which many people play, and I honestly think more people need to see it."

So i cant really complain about the game design.  what i do hate however is the overkill mentality that run rempant in this game. i'm not pointing any thingers as i'm pretty sure most of the concerned people arent even interested in the community and reddit. (let's call them filthy pubs)  when it's server smash time, then you gotta win, no matter what. but on live, why cant people try to make things enjoyable for everyone ? i mean what is the point of those whole platoon capturing empty bases with 2 zepher libs hovering above spawn, 4 MAX ready at each doors and a few HE tanks shelling said spawn... and nobody comming out of it.  this debate has been around for ages and i'm not really trying to make it happen again bcuz like i said most of the responsible wont even hear about it.  anyway i'm really happy to learn that you guyz are another small outfit that can weight in the balance and i love you already."

Prior to the merges primetime saw approx 1100-1300 people online, whereas these days we have 1800-2100 at prime time (although this is a bad week to take the numbers from given the reddit rage factor).  Also sorry for the broad range, I can't be arsed being more precise.  To put things a little more into perspective, the population you see at lunchtime these days is the population you saw at prime time prior to the merges.

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Punisher_Ps2,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:08:14 2015 UTC,you serious? how good are you though?
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,killALLilluminati,2,Mon Apr 13 09:17:55 2015 UTC,You will never get as good as yo were before because the ESF isn't as agile as before. But that's true for everyone so if you were among the best before the change you will still be among the best now. It takes a few hours to get into it and learn what ESF can and can't do anymore.  Its kinda fun learning new things nth even they the old system was way better. It has forced me to start using keys for roll and that's something I will have use for even if they revert it.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,6,Mon Apr 13 09:51:04 2015 UTC,"Really dont see your point, Tomcats just became even more OP than before, if you fly solo and you get jumped by 2 esfs there was a good chance of surviving and killing them before the patcb, now you have to stop dodging to be able to hit and the other one just sprays you to dead while you are still trying to kill the 1st one. That patch has destroyed the airgame for solo pilots and that is the reason majority of the BLNG members cannot be bothered to fly again."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,LeKunibert,3,Mon Apr 13 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"Okay first of all we are just asking you to fly in the smash so there won't be any lockons.   And that last part is complete bullshit, I'm still dodging just as much as before while shooting the enemy. It's harder to pull it off against multiple enemies because leading is slower but in no way do you need to stop and hover like a retarded to be able to aim.  It's true that it has gotten harder as a solo pilot and I don't mind that so much, it promotes team play and I kinda like that more. Again though we aren't trying to convince to keep playing the game, just fly in the smash for 2 hours."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"and they shouldn't fly solo anyway, this game is about teamplay."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,2,Mon Apr 13 20:41:18 2015 UTC,"A rather poor argument.   Firstly, it falls squarely into the category of ""not my way = wrong way"". A rather limited take on anything.  Next from the point of view of a game, very few can operate and be successful by removing all aspects of solo play. Even completely team-games such as MOBAs or team FPS game from CSGO/Battlefield all rely on many solo players to populate the game. ""Teamplay"" can be used to justify a variety of dumb game decisions, in the end, you don't need game design to work together. So even if you only like to play in a team, you should realise that the majority of people in the game are running around solo, if they leave your game becomes a hell of a lot less fun.  It's like the PL system, everyone always shouted at SOE to implement in-game systems to make people lead, better ways to control their platoons etc. It was about ""teamplay"", we needed x, y, and z to control the platoons to get good fights.  But those systems wouldn't make me lead again, you can all the support you want, but if the underlying strategy and meta-game of PS2 is so simple a 5 year-old could win an alert why should people who are really interested in a challenge keep leading.   The same thing has happened here, changing the controls on a game after 2 years, hasn't helped teamplay, it's just lowered the skill ceiling and took the challenge out of it for many. And what does it do? How has the game benefited from this? Have thousands have people signed up for PS2 because of this change? I doubt it If anything the negative press this will have generated will have turned people off."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,BlckJck103,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:42:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, point by point (I've calmed down a bit) 1. yes, you are right. 2. I will admit we need solo players.  3. I can handle the PL system. I don't have any problem with it, as a matter of fact I find PLing enjoyable no matter the system. 4. Damn shame, I thoroughly enjoyed all the Platoons and Squads you lead while in TRID, everyone did. I personally take satisfaction in making this game enjoyable for others, although I admit not many share my sentiment. 5. I agree. In no way whatsoever do I consider these changes justified, useful or good, in fact is convinced me that DGB has an average IQ of about 50, at least the upper management (smedley probably hovers around the 20 mark) but that isn't what I'm on about."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,1 point,Tue Apr 14 11:27:16 2015 UTC,"Teamplay should be rewarded yes,, and always has been,  but many players enjoy going solo too, for lots of reasons. I don't see any reason the game couldn't provide an environment for both solo and teamplay. It's also more enjoyable for me as a mediocre pilot to run into one LeKunibert than two-three LeKuniberts, even if the end result is the same. So solo play should be encouraged as well as teamplay imo. Pro choice yo."

I barely hit them my arm was moving around the table like a mad man casue the pitch buttons don't like turning my ESf, I just couldn't bare to it though you and others are among the ones who like new things well...I'm not and it still upsets me why they still moved on with this patch ignoring us"
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,killALLilluminati,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I hate the change just as much as you do. Hover mode has taken a slight need and flying forward is stronger as a result so the moon's will have an easier time against hover masters. That might be an unintended change but might lead to a better air game for new pilots."

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,xPaffDaddyx,5,Mon Apr 13 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"Well it sounded like that, sry if I was wrong, but you like provoking comments. To the xPWR thing, I thought you considered BLHR=xPWR, because you like both outfits alot.   I joined Vipers just to check them out (not to do big gank squads lol), cause alot of guys I was playing with in Trident already left and I was like a guy with an outfit tag, nothing really more.   And only because they are guys in Vipers which like to fly together, that doesn´t automatically mean that I will do those things as well/all the time. But in my opinion you can´t blame them, cause you did that as well or better you are still doing it (alot less tho) and this game is about teamplay not soloing.   Well I never hated Vipers, I was only annoyed about dying to their squad, but that´s my bad than. Ok some guys pissed me off with their behaiviour, but now they seem to be ok, so I don´t have a problem with them.   Ofc I laughed about it with you and I would do the same think with guys I know if they would fail at something or whatever. Just don´t make those provoking comments next time, and especially to me, cause they only cause useless drama."

Haven't logged in after the change day and don't really need to be reminded how good things could had been.   For me it's not that much about adapting to the controls again or anything but I just in general don't want to support the devs in anyways anymore. They just gave us a straight fuck you and I'm giving that back by not playing, it's the only thing we can do and I'm just doing my part."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Toast_T,7,Sun Apr 12 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to annoy some people here, which I try not to do as an FC, but I feel this has to be said.  This applies to all the guys that are pulling out.  There are 576 participants in this match then there are fun police, admins, referees, technical people, casters etc.  There are people like me who have put vast amounts of time into making this happen and making it a good match.  There are the players on Cobalt who didn't get to play but who all take pride in our Server Smash performances.  By choosing not to honour the commitment you made when you signed up, particularly as somebody who is very influential with other pilots, you are putting all of that at risk.  I don't yet know if I can replace all the pilots that are dropping out.  I certainly can't replace them with pilots of the same quality because they don't exist on any server.  This is bigger than you and my view is that dropping out of the match one week before, when we have very little time to fix it, is purely selfish.  So maybe you won't enjoy, but suck it up anyway.  If I commit to do something and pulling out will fuck other people over then I honour that commitment whether I want to or not."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Bequis,4,Mon Apr 13 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, he's setting up a pretty solid statement with his decision BECAUSE the whole thing is so big. Who cares if I don't sign up, people don't know me and I'm no ace pilot anyway. If I quit because I don't like the new direction the game's going nobody cares. If Bequ quits people should start realising that something's wrong with the game here."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Bequis,2,Mon Apr 13 17:39:41 2015 UTC,I couldn't predict there would be a major change to worse before the match when I signed up. All thanks to the devs who think it's all right to mess up the PC version of the game for the good of a console port. If there's 576 people who are fine with that then by all means go ahead. I'm not. I'm protesting against it and not playing the game. That sadly includes the match.   I do feel sorry for everyone who has put work for it  but there's really no one else to blame than the devs. It's selfish for them to think PC players would accept console controls. And tbh in my opinion even more stupid for PC players to accept it.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,5,Mon Apr 13 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Your protest is entirely undermined by the fact that all other servers have not had any problems at all getting pilots.    You told me that you would fly after the changes.  You said you would do it just for the 2 hours and now you are going back on your word and your are screwing us over.  You can have all the high-minded reasons in the world but you are still going back on your word and screwing us over.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,2,Mon Apr 13 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"Your protest is entirely undermined by the fact that all other servers have not had any problems at all getting pilots.

You said you would do it just for the 2 hours and now you are going back on your word and your are screwing us over.   That was before all the bullshit from Radar_x which finally made me quit.

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,0,Mon Apr 13 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"He signed up. He made the decision to help our server in the serversmash. Now after (an admittedly seriously shitty) patch, he says he will no longer fulfill his promise he made by signing up. There have been bad patches before, you as one of the best pilots I have seen with my own eyes, should know that. He simply refuses to accept this new challenge. And he knows that his word carries a certain weight, but instead of sucking it up and talking to the other good pilots to make them stay on, he takes the cowards way out and does not fight for our server. This server is the best, he is a big part of the reason, it should be his personal pride to win even with this great challenge. Halospud said it, connery emerald and Miller have an airforce. Why do their pilots stay on but ouds don't? They aren't leaving in protest as far as I can see. They are relishing their opportunity to fight and (as they hope) destroy us. Our air makes us strong. Without air we would not have been champs last time, how are we supposed to defend that title if our best players suddenly decide they don't feel like it because they can't aim or something. Didn't they learn how to fly? Can they (and you) not learn to fly again? I simply feel betrayed. I was looking forward to warpgating those Miller bastards. Now I get to look forward to two hours of aerial bombardement while we desperatley try to win on ground forces alone. Sorry for the rant, it just pisses me off that people can be so selfish."

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,-1,Tue Apr 14 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"We need an airforce. You guys are some of (or probably are) the best pilots out there. We need you. Do have no sense of duty?

We've invested a lot of time and effort (lol I sound like Briggs) in order to be as good as we can be. Other outfits have also been training a while as far as I know.

So yes, it's a bit selfish in my honest opinion. And again, Millers air is staying on, what makes you ""better"" than them (apart from skillz ofc, I'm not questioning that :) )"
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Toast_T,3,Tue Apr 14 09:01:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the rant, it just pisses me off that people can be so selfish.   As opposed to the counter argument you and halo have made.  ""Play because you said you would. . . . .  and we'll lose""  Selfishness isn't a one way street. You criticise people for leaving the game, but you say they should play because otherwise you'll get groundpounded for 2 hours.  There's no argument for selflessness here. You want some people to do something they don't want to to to please you.  The other side wants to do what they want to do because they are done with PS2.  As I've said elsewhere, rather than rant at people, why didn't you make a thread asking, pleading, BLNG to play in one more game. You never know, if they saw how many people wanted them back for one last match, they might have given it a shot, or at least some of them would.  You, halo and others rushed to criticise blng and try and force bequ back by creating a moral dilemma for him and trying to paint his decision as selfish and going back on an agreement. But how do you think that will end? You've got a guy who doesn't want to play and your trying to force him back in. You end up forcing more people away who see this and think ""Just not worth it, they don't like us, just don't want to lose""."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,TheFatherlessChild,2,Tue Apr 14 05:54:56 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more but it seems they only want us because they need us. Some people might have reconsidered playing or even installing the game again if people showed how much they appreciate our help. Can't see that happening now especially with the stuff that has been said these past few days.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Nuklartouch,-1,Tue Apr 14 11:16:09 2015 UTC,"point by point (again) 1. I won't be the only one groundpounded. There's quite a few others. 2. As far as I know I am not the only player this sunday. 3. Fine, I can't blame them for being done with the game. 4. JackJack taught me leading. I do not plead (joke). yeah sure but it seems Punisher and a few others don't need me to be a bitch and get on my knees. 5. you make a good point. and I suppose I have to agree to some extent. I like BLNG. They are the best out there (I've said this). But this kind of behaviour is not what I expected from these players. I expected a more gung ho, let's go get em' attitude.  5."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Xaniy,3,Tue Apr 14 11:41:18 2015 UTC,"Why don't you fly yourself?   Bequ has ""betrayed"" nobody and he certainly isn't a ""coward"". He doesn't quit because he thinks Cobalt might lose or something, he leaves because the guys over at DGC are mighty dicks and manage to fuck up their own game very proper step by step. Bequs/BLNGs reaction is a form of protest and I would really wish that each and every pilot would act this way."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,-1,Tue Apr 14 11:34:39 2015 UTC,"Already signed up for Infantry, been training for weeks, which is why this pisses me off so much. And we're talking about 2 hours, which, apparently, he had already promised halospud he would play for. Other than that I completely agree that the game is fucked, and protest is a good way to go, but not now, less than a week before the match. And he is a coward because he does not accept the challenge that the new controls (which are shit) represent.  Edit: and as long as Miller pilots aren't protesting, you are putting our victory at risk."

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,2,Mon Apr 13 12:55:52 2015 UTC,You put that smiley behind but seriously... you are talking to the pilot with the best aim i know.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Spitcat,3,Mon Apr 13 13:06:56 2015 UTC,I was just poking fun because that's something a lot of bling guys used to say to scrubs. My point is If he had good aim before he will still have good aim after a few hours of getting used to it.  Or are you saying you can't  tease/make fun off someone when he is a really good pilot?
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,3,Mon Apr 13 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"One has two options.  Lower the sens so much you can aim, which makes the esf impossbile to control.  Or leave it on the higher level which makes the esf controllable but your aim goes everywhere"
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Aloysyus,2,Mon Apr 13 12:55:33 2015 UTC,"I went with option number 3, lower sense and learning to use roll on the keyboard to enable those maneuvers again. It's gonna take time before I can do it good but so far it's working pretty good. I dropped around 500 dpi compared to before."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"Roolling with key binds is broken as well btw, it's no long 100% roll speed like it use to be."

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"You can make fun, but i still don't see your point: Kuni is the pilot with the best aim and the new controls are not adaptable to. There is no mechanic that allows you to am like before. The skill gap is still the same since beginners and mediocre pilots will hit even worse but it is still completely retarded."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Aloysyus,4,Tue Apr 14 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"My point was to make a joke and saying the controls aren't adaptable to is pretty naive imo. If I can adapt to it I'm pretty sure kuni can too, he might not want to but he sure as hell can if he really wanted too.  I'm not trying to defend what they did and the way they did it, it's beyond retarded and I hope they crash and burn for it. But is asking someone to fly for 2 hours in the smash too much?"
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,BlckJck103,0,Mon Apr 13 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"Last question: no!  The rest: I still don't get what you mean by ""adapt"". Aiming like before is not possible. It just isn't. It's a different game and either you like it or not."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Spitcat,2,Mon Apr 13 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yes aiming isn't what it used to be, but if you had a 40% acc before you can attain the same numbered with a few days of practice and that's what I mean with adapt."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Sotanaki,2,Mon Apr 13 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"The new controls are just not fun. When controls are frustrating there is no point is using them. I play this game for fun, with the new controls i don't have it.It was good before, it is gone to crap. I can keep the skill gap between me and worse pilots but for me there's more to it than that."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,RachitynowyJoe,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't one of ""Can I adapt"". Very few changes break the game to the point where people who were once good can never be good again.  But with something like this you've forced a change for rather dubious reasons with rather dull results and you're going to have portions of your player base quit because of it. When you're game is 2 years old, and frankly, not healthy.  It's like ""rage-quitting"" on Recursion. I bet >70% of disconnects are after you die. But how many of them are because of rage. You've been playing for a couple hours, die and think ""good time to stop then"".  That's what changes like this do to games. It creates a forced break it what was. Sure you can learn to adapt, but for others the changes forces the question is this game now worth effort adapting? The sad truth is that for more and more PS2 is not worth that effort. It's just the excuse or final straw needed to push people away from the inertia of playing the game because they have been and go find another."

They just straight away took out all the exciting stuff with this change. It's not even a matter of just practising to get back into it, if you could do that people would have done it already, you just wont get good precision back and with the momentum and movement changes flying has been reduced to hovering like a retard.  Sure, you could just grind it out but and get decent again but what's the point?"
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,3,Sun Apr 12 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"this whole change, to me it feels like a nerf to pilots."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,4,Mon Apr 13 11:15:03 2015 UTC,"They changed the whole underlying system of the game, it's most noticeable on aircraft but it's affecting everything. You're basically playing a console port atm, with the console version not being out yet. That's really funny if you think about it."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,3,Mon Apr 13 11:40:38 2015 UTC,completly right but i dont get amused by that fact if i consider that i have spend my money on a bad console port.

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,2,Mon Apr 13 13:07:40 2015 UTC,and why should i force myself to get used to the new mechanics if i dont enjoy flying with them?
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,2,Mon Apr 13 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"The things I enjoy about flying was the challenge, getting out alive from being engaged by 3+ enemies etc. All those things are still present in the game. If Yuri are quitting because it's no longer fun I think you are doing it for th wrong reason because it is still fun to fly."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,2,Mon Apr 13 09:30:13 2015 UTC,"haha daikar you should know me better.  I started flying becouse i enjoy the sense of freedom. Nothing better than smoking some green, listening to music and flying arround the mountains and trees of auraxis.  I got in the more competitive side of flying after w0rthy told me about you and i saw your style of flying and took the challange of fighting aswell.  The change of the mechanics give me a really limited feel in manouverabillity so it impacts the MAIN reason why i enjoy flying DIRECTLY. I cant longer roam arround auraxis flying trough gates, bridges, under trees, do loops, rolls and crazy manouvers."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:56:05 2015 UTC,"I think you are a bit wrong there, flying forward and low under building and stuff is pretty much unchanged. Hover mode is a bit more sluggish and leading targets in it is harder since they out maneuver you in forward flight."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,KurtGG,3,Mon Apr 13 11:10:33 2015 UTC,srsly you want to tell me if the changes impacted my gaming experience or not ?   Another thing is if you keep playing after getting screwed over continuessly over the last year and now bigtime it makes you a easy victim as a consumer. And i am tired of hoping that things will get better.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:22:57 2015 UTC,Sorry no I'm just saying that I also enjoyed the freedom and flying low etc and I find I can still do that and still have fun. The change was very frustrating and annoying at first but after a while you get into it and have just as much fun as before.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,KurtGG,2,Mon Apr 13 11:28:02 2015 UTC,yes we can still fly but we can only do 85% (estimated) of what we were used to. I completly dissagree with the decissions the team has been making over the last year. Ofcourse they dont give a shit about my opinion but why should i give a shit about theyr game than ?  Face it they screwed over ALL the pc players for ps4 and as somone who has payed serveral hundrets of euros i find that really insulting.
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Daikar,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:21:32 2015 UTC,"You can still do all the maneuvers that you could before, the only thing that has changed is that you can't lead targets as fast in close combat. And that's not really a maneuver imo.   I understand that you want nothing to do with the devs and I have no faith in them any longer either. You ask why you should even bother with the game, what you should ask is why you should bother helping your friends and teammates for two more hours. We aren't asking you to get back into the game nor practice the new controls, we just want pilots that signed up to fly for 2 hours and that's it.  One last time we should show Miller that our air force is the best there is and not even a massive change like this will change it."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,Ometen,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:49:12 2015 UTC,what you should ask is why you should bother helping your friends and teammates for two more hours   thats what i am continuesly asking myself...

Quitting the smash just because the controls are shit? SS is the only ""fun"" part of this shitty update. Just imagine all those pilots crashing into each other because of these controls, If you're a real deal ace pilot deal with it and enjoy the air derby! Maybe you'll learn a thing or two on how to deal with it on live while we wait for the update to be reverted!  Who knows you might even find that you've improved as a pilot aswell. Personally I think this update is a challenge and I accept."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,killALLilluminati,6,Mon Apr 13 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"I left becouse i have to draw a line as a consumer not becouse i am not able to relearn. If you keep playing eventhough you dont agree with what the devs are fucking up you will never give them a intention to change the behaviour and as a result of that they will continuesly scew you/us over. Problem atm is that devs are not taking pc playerbase srsly. We have been waiting for new content, fixes, good ping, metagame, etc but they are not delivering eventhough i personally keept the money flowing. But all we got is them fucking up flying mechanics becouse they are to incompetent to code a 2nd control sceme for gamebad.  For me it is time to move on and supporting other dev teams wich are actually capable of doing shit."

PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,HerrLuky,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:23:06 2015 UTC,"I think everyone understands and supports that reason for not playing, but the smash is a 2 hour match and even without getting used to the controls you will still be a good pilot. Since they game is free you don't need to give them any money to take part in the smash one last time."
PS2Cobalt,32d4qi,DrXTC,2,Tue Apr 14 06:11:19 2015 UTC,Daikar i have no problem to adjust to the controls but since i am playing for fun and my own joy and i dont enjoy forcing myself to do smth i dont like i just dont do it.

World of Warcraft got so succesfull and for so long people were getting fed up of the changes and lapping up news for every new game that would come out, yet none was ever able to really take on the giant. If it did it would fall short in some way and people would reluctantly return to WoW having failed to find anything that can replace what they enjoyed about WoW even in its worst state.  Like here, many people will try other games, but as it stands there is nothing really like PS2 that has the ability to attract a majority to it.

A simple rule is ... If you dont like smth stop supporting / buying it and as a result the guy who wants to sell it will maybe realise what he has done wrong and adjust to it.   But just moaning and not taking any ""action"" will just let the companys get away with it and becouse of that they will screw you over again."

PS2Cobalt,32a9qh,Punisher_Ps2,2,Sun Apr 12 08:37:36 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware, Composite is no longer a mandatory, the splash damage increase is nice but the most important change has been the turret stabilisation on it that makes it usable, wheras before it was practically like peeing whilst drunk.  Evasiveness is still a main frame of use although hover is great for small squad play (pushing analogue throttle stops you moving almost instantly.  A2G still requries alot of short passes to get any decent amount of kills but its maneuverability allows you to stay longer than you would in an ESF, with the addition of now being able to take stealth that helps.  A2A is still wyvern, although the new helion changes will make things intereesting. We're really liking the new Helion buffs, stabilisation and damage makes it feels like a vulcan. It one clips most vehicles in the rear and can 2 clip an MBT from 150m into top armour.  It feels a bit like a harraser of the skies as its a fast in and out playstyle although still vulnerable.  Problems that still exist: Thermals are useless on every gun still as they are still limited to a 50m range and are still probably due an extending.  There is probably plenty more. Khall gets involved on the main reddit with Valk balance discussions so I can throw him past here or link his previous threads from the main one. Hope this helped"

PS2Cobalt,329f08,Sotanaki,3,Sat Apr 11 21:50:39 2015 UTC,You cant really wait tbh. I dont think there are many non-pilots who are leaving the game/upset at the moment. That leaves 5/6 platoons that still need to be organised. Outfit reps are aware that they have responsibilities wider than issues within the game and are required to put things into place and operate in a proffesional matter regardless of any changes that occur. I can imagine for example that your own outfit reps will be present.  The only issue I can forsee is that an air lead might not put themselves forward... but if we waited then we might just encounter the same problem and we also then lose the time in prepping the 5 ground platoons and multiple outfit reps. The SS organisation is already a bureaucratic and logistical nightmare so we dont need to leave it to the last minute. This is just business as usual for us.  Failing to prepare in adequate time will unlikely create alot of problems so I think that we should indeed press on.
PS2Cobalt,329f08,Xaniy,2,Sun Apr 12 00:23:20 2015 UTC,Well I can only hope you're right.
