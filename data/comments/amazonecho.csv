On their help page, they say ""If your Amazon Echo is paired with multiple devices, it connects to the most recent paired device.""  Although it also says ""After it's paired, your mobile device automatically connects to Amazon Echo when you turn on Bluetooth and say, [Wake word], connect.""  Wonder if you turn off all bluetooth on devices except one and say the wake word, connect if it will find the only one on?"

So the only other point of contact that's part of this system is the Echo itself.  I am not sure if Amazon is willing to allow 3rd parties to have access to allow Echo to issue general network commands.  That said, if SONOS gets involved, I could see that.  But they don't seem to keep on expanding their lineup/capabilities these days."

To get some insight into how it works, check out the first intent in intents.json. It's called PlayIntent. When Alexa hears a phrase in utterances.txt that is tagged with PlayIntent, it sends PlayIntent to Lambda. You can open up lambda/src/index.js to see how the Lambda service catches the PlayIntent request.  If Lambda isn't getting PlayIntent, then I'd guess the wrong thing was pasted into either the Intents Schema or the Utterances. PM me if it looks right, and you're stuck."

I used the instructions for AWS Lambda because I didn't want to mess with getting a signed certificate for my web service, but if say you already have a server you can use a self-signed certificate.

amazonecho,3dz8wl,RChamltn,3,Mon Jul 20 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"If you ask ""Alexa: Wikipedia necrotizing fasciitis"" she'll give you all the gory details.  Whenever you want factual information like that, ask Alexa to Wikipedia it because Wikipedia is where she gets her results. She has no on-board database of this stuff, she has to access outside resources and if you don't tell her which resource to use, she doesn't know where to find your answer.  RE: entertainment, you can ask things like ""who won the Best Actor Oscar in 1988"", but for more detailed info about TV shows and movies you're going to have to wait for something like an IMDB Echo Skill. Since Amazon owns IMDB and has integrated IMDB into all their video tech, it seems a likely candidate for integration into the Echo too.  But again: remember that the Echo is, for the most part, nothing more or less than an interface. You can't expect it to pull answers out of thin air, it has to have a data repository to connect to. Amazon covered a lot of those bases by launching with Wikipedia connectivity and I'm sure more databases are coming to Echo in the future. Be patient."
amazonecho,3dz8wl,zodd06,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:49 2015 UTC,I was not aware that Amazon owns IMDB! When she couldn't answer the entertainment questions I immediately thought of them because that is my go to app whenever those type of questions come up. That is exciting!

amazonecho,3du1oe,OKHnyc,6,Sun Jul 19 13:45:00 2015 UTC,"This is because the system is designed to fetch music by song/track name, artist name, album name or playlist name---though not composer name---and to get a match you have to get the name of the song/track, artist, album or playlist exactly right. In my own classical collection, the song names are very long and often include special characters like brackets and foreign characters, which probably confuse Alexa since you can't easily pronounce them when making your request.   The solution is simple: Create a playlist for each composer (Mozart, Bach, etc.) or type of classical you want (baroque, symphonies, opera, etc.) and then ask her to play or shuffle the desired playlist.   Problem solved."
amazonecho,3du1oe,RChamltn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Another trick is that you can rename tracks in your Cloud library. Not a classical track (heavy metal opera instead), but Alexa could never under stand the command ""Play Balrog Boogie by Diablo Swing Orchestra"". She got 'boogie' and 'Diablo Swing Orchestra' so it was a bit disappointing that she couldn't work out the mis-understood Balrog part (not a common word but she found a match for everything else). I think she prioritizes the first word in the search because I eventually renamed the song ""Boogie (Balrog Boogie)"" in the cloud. Now when prompted to play ""Boogie by Diablo Swing Orchestra"" she just confirms I want ""Boogie Balrog Boogie"" and then plays it. Just give it a few minutes after the name change in order for it to update on the Echo search."

Many classical pieces are labeled just by what they are and their key (e.g. Concerto in G Major) while others will be known by their nicknames (""unfinished symphony"", ""nocturne"", etc).

The Echo app on her phone should look for an existing Amazon account registered on her device. If that matches an account registered on the Echo, she shouldn't have to ""sign into"" anything.  What do you mean by ""Now when she logs into the Amazon echo app it wants her to go through setup like she has a new Echo""?  Does she use the regular Amazon app on her device, with the same account you used in your echo app?

I've seen a lot of Prime Music hate lately and was really surprised. Maybe I'm one of the few people the selection caters to (largely listen to different forms of rock/punk/alt with some random others mixed in) but I haven't run into many issues with Prime Music's selection so generally it's plenty. If I ever did I would probably just use bluetooth. If Prime were still at its lower price I may strongly consider the 25/year, but at 99/month plus my other subscriptions (Netflix and Marvel Unlimited) I don't think Music Library would be worth it."

I enjoy it and have already set up some robots and IFTTT recipes that utilize the bulbs and I've only had them for a day or two.  That said, for another day or so I think Home Depot has a deal where if you buy 2 Wink Compatible products (like bulbs) you get the Wink Hub for 20 bucks which is basically the same price and the Wink Hub can link more products (the Link only works with GE bulbs). Both Link and Wink Hub compatible bulbs can be found for about 15 bucks.   love the idea of the Hue, but with the cost per bulb it was way out of my price range. The Hub will work with cheaper bulbs, but at that point why bother? The only advantage it really has (that I saw) was the ability to change colors.

I have a Leviton Z-Wave switch connected to my front porch that I can't get to turn on/off via robot. I think it's to do with the trigger, but I'm not sure. I have it setup to turn on the switch if my Schlage Connect is locked and it's sunset. This doesn't work, however.

I think smart switches are a better option than smart bulbs because with bulbs you have the issue of not being able to switch it off at the wall and back on with your voice. Also with switches you can use whatever bulbs you want, which ends up being a LOT less expensive when you're throwing more than one or two bulbs on a switch."

There's a hack for the wemo where you can turn it into a soft switch. You hardwire the light to always be on, then put the wemo in without hooking it up to the light. Using SmartThings you can configure it so that pressing the switch toggles your hue lights via software, giving you access via the switch and with your voice/phone apps."
amazonecho,3dm9b9,wkearney99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:05:41 2015 UTC,Trouble is I'm finding the WeMo switches will not reliably reconnect to the network if there's power outages.  This leads to the Echo not seeing them until they're rediscovered.
amazonecho,3dm9b9,zimm3rmann,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:04 2015 UTC,That's no good. Fortunately I don't regularly have outages but that's really annoying. Think it's an issue with the switch itself or DHCP? If the router assigns the switch a new IP when it reconnects Echo would probably need to scan the network again to find it.
amazonecho,3dm9b9,wkearney99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, all network gear (ALL of it) is on UPS battery backup.  The problem is the switches won't reliably reconnect themselves.

amazonecho,3dm9b9,oni222,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:38 2015 UTC,I have used both WeMo lightswitches and GE Light bulbs/Leviton power switches with Wink.  The WeMo work directly through your wifi and it does not require any outside internet connection or a hub. Because of that feature the response time is instant.  The Wink hub takes a few seconds to turn on ALL the lights. The worse part though is that there has not been a single week gone by where the Wink API did not have issues. One time they even bricked my hub (and thousands others) because of a security fix they deployed. I had to mail them the hub and it took about a month to get it back. Having no lights for a month was not an option so I had to change my setup while the hub was out for repairs.
amazonecho,3dm9b9,mrhoopers,2,Fri Jul 17 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"One small point. WeMo doesn't ""require"" the Internet to function but it does connect to their servers for updates and so you can control them when you are not on your home network."
amazonecho,3dm9b9,oni222,2,Fri Jul 17 21:47:56 2015 UTC,Yeah that is what I like about WemO. It is quick and does not require connecting to a server to work. Unlike the Wink supported devices.
amazonecho,3dm9b9,bigverm23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"untrue statement about Wink having API issues weekly.  Wink has been vastly improving and only gets better with each update.  With that being said, Echo integrates with Philips Hue and any lights connected to it very well.  The benefit to having the Hue Lux lights specifically over the Links for example, is dimming capability.  Echo can dim the Lux lights very well and quickly.  GE Link lights will dim as well but are a little less responsive to Echo commands vs the Lux lights.  $80 gets you the Hue bridge, 2 lux lights and then allows you to connect many other brands directly to the Hue bridge."

But my Mac is in the office downstairs and the Echo is in the kitchen upstairs. (My house is weird. You enter on the 2nd floor and bedrooms are downstairs.)  The problem with Echo is that I now want Echo in every room. LOL
amazonecho,3dkd3k,T0mmyGun,2,Thu Jul 16 23:43:16 2015 UTC,I have five of those things and can turn them all on or off with my echo but it took some hacking. First you need a z-wave hub (I use a SmartThings hub) and then you need a piece of software that tricks the Echo into thinking that the devices on your hub are connected to a Phillips Hue hub (I use this https://github.com/schettj/echostadapter/tree/master which runs as a Node.js app on a raspberry pi)
amazonecho,3dkd3k,dvenable,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:13 2015 UTC,And you can't just directly connect this with the Hue Hub right? You have to go through all that? Welp... Looks like I found a reason to finally pull the trigger on a Pi.
amazonecho,3dkd3k,dvenable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"The Hue hub doesn't speak the z-wave protocol. That's where the SmartThings hub comes into play. SmartThings speaks a majority of the home automation languages and has a very robust interface for writing your own apps coupled with an amazing support community.   Also, I run the node.js piece on a raspberry pi because it's already sitting there as a low energy always on device on my home doing other jobs so that I don't have to leave a much more power hungry computer running 24x7 but running it on a Windows or Apple computer is doable."
amazonecho,3dkd3k,dvenable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, the developers at SmartThings have dropped hints that they are in the process integrating with the Echo. I'm not sure if they are just developing an ASK skill like any other developer or if they are working closely with Amazon on this but SmartThings integration with the Echo without a hack could be coming very soon."
amazonecho,3dkd3k,HowInTheHell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:55 2015 UTC,"If your going to buy a Pi, then just use openHAB for the ""hub"".  You'll need to get a 25$ USB Zwave dongle, but after that and some tinkering it works great.  My echo controls pretty much anything my openHAB does.  So TV's(on and off only for now, until I stop being lazy and write a Skill), Sonos, lights(zwave, as well as MiLight LED strips).  Pretty much everything in my house is controllable.  Most of it can be done w/ Echo as well."
amazonecho,3dkd3k,HowInTheHell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't bought a hub yet so this is possible? I have an Echo, Nest, and started buying up a few GE Link Bulbs when I find deals. I'm hoping I can get lights, thermo, and some devices like TVs/Computers all running. I can get a Pi and turn it into a hub without a Hue hub or smart things hub? Sorry for all the dumb questions, just starting to put all the pieces together to figure this thing out."
amazonecho,3dkd3k,dvenable,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"So it's a bit like a zigsaw puzzle at this point.  For me openHAB puts the pieces together since they all use different technologies.  Nothing but Hue and Wink currently work work the Echo.  Some great guy made something called the Hue Bridge, which basically emulates the Hue.  So you can have the Echo ""find"" devices, and it sees whatever you put in.  It will control anything that's in there.    Echo currently does nothing w/ thermostats.  But, by using the ""Bridge"" I can say ""Alexa, turn on the A/C"", and it will.  Echo actually thinks it's a light, but openHAB knows better.  It does not allow me to set a temp, but it allows me to turn things on and off(and dim any of my lights).    My echo currently does do TV, but just on/off.  Same thing with Sonos.  I have a few select stations setup where I can say ""Alexa, turn on Sonos Disney radio"", or ""Alexa turn on Sonos Country radio"", etc.  It works very well.    Basically, openHAB is the glue.  Everything setup in the bridge is a link to openHAB to do something.    Because it's a bridge, and we're ""faking"" a hue, you can only use ""on"", ""off"" or ""dim"" commands. So that's a limitation w/o having to write a skill, and have to ""ask"" your home to do something, which I will probably eventually get to."

The hue app, my Harmony Home Hub etc. all play well with both, but the Echo loses the ability to access the GE bulbs on a regular basis.  Nothing else has problems with them, and the Echo has no problems with anything else.  I'll be very interested to hear how you get on with them and the Wink."
amazonecho,3di7d1,RikF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Whelp, it took more effort than I thought it would going in, but I'm pretty much there! The paring of one bulb went smooth as silk, but the other bulb won't pair and won't factory reset no matter what I do, so I'm going to assume it's a duff and return it tomorrow for a replacement.   The ZWave switch was a breeze. It took longer to wire in than it might have done simply because I previously had a switch that didn't need the neutral, so I had to find a piece of wire to pig-tail from, but once wired in the pairing worked like a dream.   One thing to note, when I went through device discovery in the Echo app (having already created a group in the Wink app), it found each light and I could turn them on and off by voice no problem, but it didn't import the group I created in the Wink app, I had to create the group again in the Echo app. Not a big deal with only 2 items right now, but might be useful information for the future...."

You name each light individually, and then you can add them to a group however you like. Just name the individual ones different or it will confuse Alexa - for example I had Kitchen Light one and Kitchen Light two and put them in a group called Kitchen Lights. It worked much better once I named them Kit1 and Kit2, then put them in a group called Kitchen Lights. Now when I say ""Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights"" both lights in the group go off. Make sense? When you create a new group there is a list of all of your connected lights and you just check the ones that you want to be a part of that group."

Google Now on my phone gets less and less use.  Amazon opening the API so wide is a crushing blow.  I'm a poor coder but the ASK coding is easy even for a code moron like me.
amazonecho,3dgmz9,gavvit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I really doubt either Amazon or Google would want to open their AI assistants to rivals right now.

Hopefully, in the future, 'voice gateway' devices like the Echo will become somewhat standard commodity items (like Bluetooth headsets) and we'll see all the various cloud based AI back-ends open to whatever hardware you want to put in your home."

Now that ASK has been released, and the official launch happened this past week, I expect it to become fantastic.  I can't wait for an Uber Skill and I already have puttered around making my own skill to check my bus timing.  I'm looking at how to write code that turns a Hue bulb red after I request a bus schedule update and when the bus is 7 minutes away.  This is by far the best piece of kit for my automated home.  I laughed at the idea in December but now it just becomes second nature for me.  On Monday I realized I was running low on paper towels, so I said ""Alexa, reorder paper towels"" and they arrived two days later.  Used to be a ""pain"" (5 minutes of puttering around on Amazon) now it is instant.  Can't wait to see what happens when the Skills store goes online."

All the features and information is stored in the cloud. There's really nothing that can be improved upon. The only thing is maybe a different speaker or an output jack or something. But I don't think you'll see another version for at least a few years.   However I'd be willing to bet that google or some other company will come out with one as well in the near future.

That makes no sense, and I suspect many people have the same issue. The only way you'd really consider using it for audio is if it's in a room with absolutely no audio already (i.e. the kitchen).  The thing is, I WANT to use it to play/control music, but currently it's inadequate for this purpose because of that. I guess since as it stands now with the volume up all the way it can't hear you, it will never actually be really effective to play music with it."

amazonecho,3dgkd5,ABC_AlwaysBeCoding,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"I know why. It de-noises the mic input by negating the sound it itself makes from its speakers. That is how it can hear you say ""Alexa"" even while it is playing loud music.  This depends on precise timings and sound profiles and such, like how a speakerphone works.  External speakers would throw that off due to the extra time it takes sound from THOSE speakers to reach the mics. Also, the sound from the Echo itself reaches all its mics at once, making a far simpler problem than having to listen over noise coming from any direction. The human brain does this easily but it is actually a VERY hard problem from a programming perspective."
amazonecho,3dgkd5,jsabo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"My bet is that a future version will support some of the features that people have been requesting, like an audio out jack, but I can't see the current version being dropped.  If you're looking for a wireless audio solution, and you have Prime, I don't think you can do any better than this device.  If you're looking at it as a digital assistant, or to control your lights, your mileage may vary. But every couple weeks, this thing gets new features, so I'm sure that will only get better over time."

I think if you buy one, you'll be happy. I use mine daily and it's great.   I come home from work in the morning and ask ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"" Unlike with Siri, I get a short but detailed description of temperature, chance of rain, etc. It's nice to just be laying in bed and ask aloud  the time, look up a person, place or thing via Wikipedia, to listen to stations on I Heart Radio, set an alarm for work, etc. All via voice.   I don't have the wifi light switches but I plan to someday. There's just something cool, conveinent & futuristic about it. It's not a novelty or anything, it's actually fun & helpful. I think voice recognition will soon be in more places, and the Echo is first true step forward for consumers.  If they aren't already, I'm sure apple & others are working on something similar. And honestly, they might be better. But right now, the Echo is the best out there in its small category. I don't think it's particularly worth $170. Maybe $120 but then again, I'm a cheap bastard.  With the Echo finally being released to consumers, and with Amazon making it open source, I think wider & more awesome functionality is on the way."

amazonecho,3ddvee,TerpSkins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:20:29 2015 UTC,I hit refresh a bunch of times and I just got on the waiting list as well.
amazonecho,3ddvee,DanceWithGoats,3,Wed Jul 15 15:45:39 2015 UTC,I was planning on getting one but the deal was over just as it started. The crappy thing is they still have it for sale at the non-prime rate.  What's the point of having Prime?

Anyway, someone else probably needed it more than I did."
amazonecho,3ddvee,baba_bona,2,Wed Jul 15 15:02:06 2015 UTC,I was seriously on the fence about buying a second one for my home office. The deal ended before I could make my decision to that helped.  Wife hasn't completely accepted the first one yet so it's probably a good thing.

amazonecho,3dda5v,rsplatpc,0,Wed Jul 15 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"""Thanks Alexa!"" ... This is one of the things I want added. It seems odd to ask for something, have that request honored and not say Thank You. Alexa should have a small 3-5 second time after each request is fulfilled so I can say Thank you and Alexa could say ""You're welcome""."
amazonecho,3dda5v,groo1322,10,Wed Jul 15 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"I submitted a suggestion to add ""Thank you"" as a way of updating Alexa that the command was preformed correctly.  As if one went to the Echo app and selected 'yes' to voice feedback."

amazonecho,3dac7t,MyPonyMeeko,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"If you're creating a skill (which would give you something like ""Alexa, ask Harmony to start Netflix""), it's pretty easy to have it hit IFTTT (using the Maker channel) and trigger a Harmony activity. Unfortunately, IFTTT is clunky and you'd currently have to set up a rule for each activity, since the Harmony actions don't take parameters.  I have mine set up in a very roundabout way involving Tasker on an Android tablet, but that's mostly due to having it already set up when I got the Echo. The IFTTT route is simpler, and hopefully some day either Amazon gets native Harmony integration, or IFTTT makes the Harmony channel accept variables."
amazonecho,3dac7t,lagvin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"This sounds like it may work for me.  In my theater room, I have an activity on my HH that will turn on the projector and receiver and set it to display the Chromecast.  I then 'beam' Netflix/Plex/whatever...  I only have iPhones, is it possible to use IFTTT to perform this task?"
amazonecho,3dac7t,lagvin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:26 2015 UTC,"Yes -- IFTTT (https://ifttt.com) is a web service, and doesn't need any mobile devices to work.  You'll have to set up ""recipes"" in IFTTT that go from the web trigger in the Maker channel (https://ifttt.com/channels/maker/triggers/1636368624-receive-a-web-request) to the Harmony action you want (https://ifttt.com/harmony#actions). You'd then need to look into how to create an Echo skill (using the Alexa Skills Kit), and have that hit the URL(s) exposed by your recipes."
amazonecho,3dac7t,j0wy,2,Wed Jul 15 13:37:02 2015 UTC,I was able to build a custom solution using Amazon Echo HA Bridge and a custom web server that talks to my OpenHAB server.

amazonecho,3dac7t,eternal_peril,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"I did the same with EventGhost  OP, as long as you have a PC, it is really quite easy to do.  You need the Above link and the harmony.exe from here  https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/377onm/extending_amazon_echo_voice_control_to_existing/?ref=share&ref_source=link  You can use OpenHAB or EventGhost  if you are a little IT savvy, you have a link, ie 192.168.1.2/on  that will trigger EventGhost which is a basic web site, and you can configure it to execute a command, which is the harmony hub command.  I am not doing it justice but it is not complicated."
amazonecho,3dac7t,qyiet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Are you able to point to a noobs guide to OpenHAB?  I had a go at getting it setup the other day, but all the documentation I found assumed you understood how the entire thing fitted together."
amazonecho,3dac7t,RikF,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, the documentation is lacking.  It took me about a day (old IT background but severely lacking in web knowledge) to get it all sorted out with my Harmony and the Echo."

amazonecho,3db5kr,sonictech170,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"Make sure you sync the mobile app manually. I haven't encountered this problem switching back and forth between my Fire tablets and the Echo, but that may be because they're all Amazon products. Even if that is a factor, I'd think manually syncing to the cloud from your mobile device should update your bookmarks."
amazonecho,3d9yx8,TerpSkins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"At the moment for the Echo to control the GE lights you need the Wink Hub or the Hue Bridge. The Link Hub doesn't work with the Echo. Currently you can buy a Wink Hub at Home Depot for $20 with the purchase of two compatible products, such as the GE Smart lights.   EDIT - I am mistaken the link hub works with the Echo apparently."
amazonecho,3d9yx8,nickels55,3,Tue Jul 14 18:03:08 2015 UTC,Someone on Slickdeals stated that the Link Hub works with his Echo.

Besides, for $20 the Wink Hub is a steal of a deal right now. I just got the Wink Hub and two GE Bulbs for $53 with tax at HD. Offer good for like 2 more months."
amazonecho,3d9yx8,MrPap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:57:39 2015 UTC,I already have the Link Hub (uses Wink app) and Staples Connect hub so not trying to get another hub.   The person that stated the Link hub works with the Echo actually has both and using it. So not sure what that person gains by lying.
