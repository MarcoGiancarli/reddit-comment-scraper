Also it might just be your carrier not delivering those messages. I found that out when I was doing sales and was on the phone the whole day. A lot of calls were never connected. Once my partner was so pissed off that I wasn't answering that he called me right in front of my face and I could hear his phone having the ringing sound but there was no call received on mine. That was on 3G. Perhaps things are better on LTE now as voice calls are routed as data right?

galaxys5,3dyg79,israphial,0,Tue Jul 21 02:33:48 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure you're fine. I ended up figuring out all my issues :)  I am running MOAR 6.6.2 based on 5.0. It is definitely slower than stock 4.4.2 so I am thinking about finding a 4.4.2-4.4.4 based ROM. I don't know what they did with Lollipop but I imagine it's meant for more powerful devices. Not a fan on my S5.

galaxys5,3dya75,craniumfried,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:48 2015 UTC,It's been a long time since I paid a lot of attention to Android but iirc what the Google play store is doing is striping out parts of the app that are unchanged so when an app downloads you dont need to download it all again even though only a few files where changed. So you might only need 40% to update the app
galaxys5,3dya75,Ninja_Fox_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:55:32 2015 UTC,Hey thank you for that I didn't know the process.    I guess the only part of it then that's really frustrating is when the percentage doesn't progress any further and just stays there sometimes for 10 seconds and then goes to the next stage which is installing. Thanks again for your feedback
galaxys5,3dya75,grkgeek,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:34 2015 UTC,I just noticed what you're talking about I just upgraded several apps because there were updates and one of them was like 40 megabytes after about 30 percent it did not display any more progress and it sat there displaying 30% there for what I counted to be 10 seconds after which time then the application started to install and changed its status to installing. I just wanted you to know I do experience the same thing. I am not sure if that means there's a problem.
galaxys5,3dvocv,Reichman,4,Sun Jul 19 22:32:30 2015 UTC,To everyone: Download ES file explorer and run thr SD card analyst via tools on the left side. It will show where the junk 15gb is.

galaxys5,3dvz8w,JamesTheMannequin,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:05 2015 UTC,Welcome to the world of lollipop and all of its memory leaks galore. I have been experiencing the same thing on the Verizon variant of the galaxy s5 it doesn't matter whether I have a custom ROM loaded or totally 100% stock I lost count at the factory resets and all the custom ROMs that I have loaded on mine ....all of them have provided the same result same experience as you with the only difference being I have very rarely had to do a battery pull eventually the device will wake up and respond.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise lollipop is full of memory leaks tons of them .... the software has a lot of problems that have never been addressed as it pertains to the galaxy s5 with lollipop.
galaxys5,3dvz8w,craniumfried,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:22 2015 UTC,So would dialing back to 4.4 be the best option here then? Can anyone verify that fixes the problem?
galaxys5,3dvz8w,craniumfried,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:10:03 2015 UTC,I don't know.  I do know that I had to downgrade as part of the process for loading custom ROMs on SM-G900V.... I think doing anything of the sort that you are thinking about is ridiculous. ...why should we as consumers have to resort to that?  I have been through all the Galaxy S models on Verizon contracts and when my contact expires in October I will NOT BE getting another Galaxy S model.    Please note that during the time it took to type this response my screen went to sleep because I paused for like 10 seconds and I had a heck of a time waking it back up..... I pressed the home button several times the power button several times finally after about the third or fourth time the damn thing responded where I had to swipe my finger and I got back. This phone sucks.

Of course, you might not even need to, if you're happy with touchwiz as is. You can make tweaks with Xposed , that can be handy. Install that and Wanam x posed. I actually couldn't install  a rom in my S4 because it was a weird version, but I could still root it, and Wanam was a life saver. Are there any changes you'd like to make up your phone currently?"

I actually like the way my phone functions now, although I probably don't know half the possibilities of what a rooted phone can do. For the most part, I am looking to extend my battery life. I normally get between 3 and 4 hours of screen time on a daily basis and that is enough for me to get through the day.

galaxys5,3dss0s,MeGustaBebes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:40:23 2015 UTC,Ok thanks! I'm new to android never owned an android phone before and the only knowledge I have is from messing around with a cheap android phone for an hour or two that ran kit kat. I'm excited to get the S5 though and I'll be sure to take your tips into consideration and do some more research myself.
galaxys5,3dss0s,blaqmamba,3,Sun Jul 19 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"S5 is good as long as you use it very casually. No root, no BootLoader unlock, no custom ROMs, no custom kernel, etc.  But once you get into that stuff, you realize how uncustomizable this frigging phone is.  These might be some other options you might want to check out:  LG G3 ($200 ~ $400)   1440p display Surprisingly decent battery life   Moto X (2014)) ($200 ~ $400)   1080p display Pure android Due to the fact that its running Pure android with no bloatware, it is one of the smoothest phone possible   Oneplus One ($250 ~ $350)   1080p display Also running pure Android Has very top class battery life   Nexus 5 ($190 ~ $280)   1080p display Phone provided by Google, meaning they designed the phone so that Android OS can be used to its fullest Smooth due to the fact that this phone also feature pure Android.   Asus Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) ($200 for a brand new device)   1080p display Very cheap device with high quality materials Available in 64GB storage and 4GB RAM   Edit: I just realized outside of AT&T and Verizon, the phone isn't too uncustomizable. Anyway, Galaxy S5 is a decent device but I think you should at least check out the reviews for the phones I listed. They're pretty decent."
galaxys5,3dss0s,jdrch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:26:10 2015 UTC,I have already looked into all of those phones besides the Asus and the Oneplus one as I have no interest in either of those. Other than maybe the nexus 5 I think I'll prefer The S5 over all of them. Thanks for the recommendations though.

galaxys5,3dm9sy,9toes,3,Fri Jul 17 12:33:35 2015 UTC,I recently added wireless charging to my S5. I got the CHOETECH wireless receiver and it fits well in the OEM S5 back. It works fine with my case although it does make the back of the phone stick out a little bit.
galaxys5,3dm9sy,lizrdgizrd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:29 2015 UTC,Same experience here
galaxys5,3dm9sy,whiskeymikie,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:37 2015 UTC,The oem wireless charging back part adds considerable thickness to the phone. I can almost guarantee it will keep your s5 from even fitting in your case.   So that leaves you with aftermarket kits which I have never had good luck with and I would bet a case would impede it's connection.   (speaking from much personal experience and disappointment)

It's not quite a perfect fit (e.g., mine fits a little better than my wife's), but I would say it's still a very good fit. But most hard cases will not fit, from what I've seen."

Then I would just drag and drop the various folders containing the pictures, videos and music.

galaxys5,3dbbkw,justeducation,4,Wed Jul 15 01:22:19 2015 UTC,I find that GSM/LTE data is more power hungry compared to Wi-Fi.

If it's more like once an hour and you know you have terrible mobile reception at work, I'd put it in airplane mode (which turns off mobile data and calling radios) and then turn on wifi.

When you do replace your battery, I recommend switching back to the OEM one for the s5.  Also, make sure your battery is not all puffy.

galaxys5,3d5xdx,infernoofihw,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:07:12 2015 UTC,They policy is basically install as little as possible. i.e. if you can't give a business purpose for installing the program then you are not allowed to install it. They're pretty lenient on that rule but that's not the real reason I want to stick with it.  I  kind of prefer the TouchWiz launcher and lock screen.   The Nova launcher doesn't let me use the stock calendar widget and the lock screen isn't compatible with Smartlock which is the best innovation ever.

galaxys5,3d2spt,justamerica46,15,Mon Jul 13 01:52:29 2015 UTC,"I turned off push sync for exchange and almost doubled battery life.  I purchased the Anker 7500 extended battery and I get about two days out of it.  I enabled developer options and turned off all animations which seems to make the phone a hair snappier.  I'm rooted and have used Titanium Backup to freeze all carrier apps.  I use GMD gestures and this means I don't ever have to search for an app-I just swipe a short pattern on the screen and the app opens. After you install it think of what apps you use most and program a gesture to go with it. Dont do every app, just the important ones. Then, practice them until they are second  nature. This also frees up my home pages for full screen widgets: Keep, Month Calendar, and Exchange Email. I have everything I need at a quick glance. A good phone is not only simple to use, but it will enable you to spend less time on it yet have a more meaningful experience when using it. I use the Moto 360 watch to keep from having to open the phone at every notification as well as to quick reply to texts. I use Adaptive Rotation to keep the phone from annoyingly rotating when I don't need it to. Seriously, look into it. I use pushbullet and peer pressure everyone into using it. Vastly opens sharing options and because of the browser extension I can text through the phone on my PC. The app Bluetooth AutoConnect keeps me from having to manually connect to my car stereo, shower speakers, headphones, Moto 360, etc. Super handy and I never think about connecting anymore. Nova Launcher. Get on it. No more bulky Touchwiz Launcher (opinion). Screen Filter. Pair it with a gesture and you'll easily dim your screen. Trust me, just do it. I suggest doing a full wipe then rooting your phone. Fresh start.   Good luck."

Like I was saying in the OP I don't really open apps the traditional way at all unless it's an app I don't often use such as Pinterest or whatever. With GMD Gestures you can set up actions and shortcuts on gesture such as ""last app"" or ""next song"" or ""screen off"" or ""full screen"" as well.

Once that is, there are tons of great modules to further increase your battery life and make your phone better in different ways. I'd recommend installing Amplify at this point too."

I'm not comfortable doing that myself so thought I'd throw some ideas your way in case you don't want to.go that route as well.    Get a good sized micro sd card.  360 Security.... nice app that has anti-virus and all that... but also has features that optimize the phone by deleting temp files and app cache to help free up your phone.  App manager 3 is what i use but find an app manager tool you like and use it. It helps identify and move apps off the phone and onto the sd card. It does require regulr use. Fun fact... every time an app updates it moves it off the sd card and back on the phone. Never knew that until it was visualized for me on the app. This app also can belp pare down the apps that austostart. Maintenance- i have a couple thumb drives i keep all my pics and videos on. I move EVERYTHING off the phone every few months to these drives. It freez up memory on the phone which is important.   Also on the freeing memory slant, text message attachments... mostly pics but whatever else. Save them to the phone/sd card and delete tbem from the text messages.   Turn off unnecessary parts of the phone. I rarely have gps on unless i need it. Especially in my work building as it will struggle to find the satellites. Turning it off just at work has extended the daily battery quite a bit.   Hope this helps if you're not looking to root the phone..."
galaxys5,3d2spt,only1mrfstr,2,Mon Jul 13 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"One major change you can make to your phone's performance is to wipe the cache partition, this is easy, quick and does not require root. After upgrading to Android 5.0, my device became unbearably laggy but after wiping the cache partition, everything is as fast as I'd expect a flagship phone to be, the UI is very snappy now with almost no waiting times when multitasking between apps.  This problem arises due to Samsung's messy update process which leaves remnants of the old system behind after an upgrade, causing all manner of glitches.  I would also advise replacing and disabling as much of Samsung's stock software and replacing it with Google apps wherever possible. Google Now Launcher to replace TouchWiz Home, Google Camera to replace stock camera, Keep to replace memos, Google Calendar to replace S Planner, Hangouts to replace Messages, Chrome to replace the stock browser, Google Keyboard to replace Samsung Keyboard, Google Play Music to replace stock music app, stock Android Clock to replace Samsung's stock clock app (nice material design and cool features like Night Screen). The logic behind this is that Android is Google's platform and thus they're the ones who define the Android experience, so if you want the best Android experience you should stick as close to stock Android as you can.

I dropped this thing over twelve times in a period of a month and a half, I think. Still hasn't cracked, shattered, or exploded into a million pieces. You know what protects the screen? That little lip around it. Sure, it'll get scratched, it'll definitely lose that gold/silver ""paint"" - but it will always protect your display.  TouchWiz is alright, but once the RAM starts increasing, then it kind of lags a lot. You should be fine. The G3 has a higher res display and I hear it drains the battery more.  With the S5, you have a faster charger, since it has USB 3.0. The newer phones don't include these anymore (why? i have no idea.). Faster data transfers when connected to PC and everything."

I went back to 4.4.4 using this guide   but there are other guides out there too.  and to clarify, my music widget itself didn't break, but if I opened my music app through the widget, i would become stuck on viewing album art of what ever song was currently playing. hitting the back key would bring up a white screen like it was going to my music library, then flash back to viewing the current song's album art and current time.  they only way i found to access my music library would be to go to the actual music app and not enter or interact with the widget that i use so often.  On a side not. I never noticed any massive loss in battery life. I was really worried about that but my phone seemed fine in that regard.

galaxys5,3cui13,bumblebelle,2,Fri Jul 10 21:51:41 2015 UTC,I have t mobile and also just updated. I'm having the exact same problem as you. I've restarted my phone 3 times today already. It only happens when I look at gifs.

galaxys5,3cseyg,sk8rphink,7,Fri Jul 10 11:51:18 2015 UTC,"Typically, you'll want to avoid the OTA update from Verizon if you're rooted because it will usually:  A) Fail  or  B) you will lose root  Even if you're willing to lose root, the update will fail because your phone and all of its files need to be setup as stock for any OTA update from Verizon to work successfully. I recommend checking out xda developers site for your model as there are usually detailed, step-by-step instructions for how to update your device without losing root. I just updated to build OE1 using the instructions found at the link below:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/verizon-galaxy-s5/general/how-to-update-to-g900voe1-5-0-keeproot-t3149784"
galaxys5,3cseyg,MWFD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:58:01 2015 UTC,I've had problems in the past with this and I suspect it was because of certain bloated system apps that I disabled or deleted with root. I went through so many that it was easier to factory reset and update than to figure out which one was causing the problem.
galaxys5,3cseyg,megaclite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:43:22 2015 UTC,"You can't run the self update successfully.  Most of the time, you have to flash it using ODIN with the updated software to get the most up to date software rooted.  It doesn't delete your personal files or installed apps if you do it right.  Edit: unfortunately, according to galaxys5root.com, any GS5 running Android 5.0+ can't be rooted.  I can't tell you for sure, but I'm still running 4.4.2 with root because it works just fine for me."

galaxys5,3cseyg,joshtats,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:57 2015 UTC,T-Mobile galaxy s5 on 5.0 rooted here. Definitely possible.
galaxys5,3cseyg,BullDog5150,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:16:51 2015 UTC,This method was specifically for AT&T and Verizon though.  I think he's just referring to TowelRoot.
galaxys5,3cseyg,euronate,4,Fri Jul 10 18:20:57 2015 UTC,Oh my bad. The way you phrased it made it seem like no gs5 with 5.0 could be rooted.
galaxys5,3cseyg,BullDog5150,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, according to galaxys5root.com, any GS5 running Android 5.0+ can't be rooted.    Indeed, it does sound like any GS5 Android 5.0+ can't be rooted means no GS5 is root capable."
galaxys5,3cseyg,i_pk_pjers_i,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:39:38 2015 UTC,It's because of root.  You'll have to flash the new update manually. Search Google and/or XDA.
