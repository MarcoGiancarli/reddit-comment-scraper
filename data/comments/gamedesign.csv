gamedesign,3e5van,eulerhopepunk,7,Wed Jul 22 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear to me that the Sonic games themselves have not; assuming by 'the 3D Sonic question' you mean something along the lines of 'a momentum based platformer in which the objective and most fun way to play is by gaining speed whilst dodging obstacles and using this speed to interact with the environment in interesting ways while doing so.' AKA the classic 2D Sonic games, but in 3D.  We can start with Sonic Adventure, which tried but fell flat. I'm a big Sonic fan and find the Adventure games fun, but when I go back and play them now they really wear their flaws on their sleeves. You can almost see the entire dev cycle in the levels. They tried to make a 3D Sonic as described, where you push forwards and there's enemies and spikes and loops - just like classic Sonic but in 3D! But it didn't work. The camera is an issue. So when he goes around loops, we pull the camera out. But now he looks really slow when he goes around loops. So let's add in boostpads to help him out. Hey, these boost pads let us get the kind of speed we always wanted, let's dot them about the level too.  What you end up with is a game where you can spend a significant amount of time giving no input at all. Which is arguably worse than 'just pushing up.' And the bits that go really fast? It's very easy to come to a complete standstill.  So they tried to solve this problem the most head-on in Sonic and the Secret Rings. No real choice, very linear levels, you don't even need a button input to go forward, it just happens - you, the player, just concentrate on dodging left and right. The result? Not super fun. You can get the speed aspect, but its artificial - if Sonic hits something, he continues going forward anyway, just a bit slower. And the gameplay itself just... isn't really that fun.  So I think the funnest 3D the Sonic games have got are the Sonic Unleashed daytime, Sonic Colours and Sonic Generations modern levels. But they don't even pretend to try and solve 'the Sonic question.' They're fun because they're a thrill - the camera pulls in and you rocket past beautiful environments at lightning speed - they mix in the dodging from SatSR with the true 3D of SA, to great effect - you can have real fun playing these games. But they're mixed in with easier to control 2D bits, and the aforementioned ""I just hit a boostpad so my input is meaningless"" problem. They're fun, they're pretty, but they're not 2D Sonic made 3D.  Now taking a step back and looking at these, what could be the consistent underlying problem? To me, SatSR gives one answer - forcing the player to hold up to move forward limits their lateral movement, as you have to remove that input to turn left or right sharply, meaning dodging obstacles in 3D becomes clunky and uncomfortable. Think about other games that go fast - you'll think of racing games. And how do they solve this problem? For racing games the translation from vehicle controls to game controls is a pretty fluid and natural one - replace a pedal with a trigger and the analog stick just controls the steering. This solves this exact problem.   But it's not very organic. It doesn't feel natural in a platformer setting. There's some real disconnect that can be felt when you play a creature as opposed to a creature controlling the machine. The brain lets you get away with one but not the other. Take Sonic R as an example - they had an interesting design dilemma. They wanted to make a Sonic racing game, but obviously Sonic would race on foot, but his competitors could be in cars, and we're a racing game after all... so accelerate was put on a button, despite half the characters being on-foot. The reception for this was generally that ""it's a bit weird.""  Sonic R is actually a really interesting example because it's half platformer half racer. It ends up being half good at each.  So at this point you might be thinking there's no hope. Probably not in the Sonic franchise itself anyway. The best Sonic-equivalent I've played, that got me really thinking there might be a formula out there that works, is Mirror's Edge. Mirror's Edge's focus isn't on the speed, but on the movement through a space, while running. There's a big distinction in the kind of gameplay the Prince of Persia Sands of Time trilogy offer vs the Assassin's Creed games - both have hooks that are the movement through the world - but where the latter's is pretty much automatic, the former's entire point is that movement through that world. Mirror's Edge falls into the PoP camp - Sonic Generations et al fall in the AC camp.  Mirror's Edge makes an entire game out of keeping on your toes, navigating an environment and, most importantly, running. Everything is built around running. If you play the game ""properly"" (ie pacifist, no guns) then each combat scenario becomes a puzzle - you have to figure out the optimal line to run in , one hit an enemy, run back into cover, work around the environment, get to the next enemy - it's all about intentional and controlled movement. Hardly anything is handed on a platter for you - I think this is the feeling a fast 3D platformer would have to nail in order to say it's solved this problem - fast, but intentional and controlled movement.  The difficulty would be in ramping up this formula to go at Sonic speeds. I don't yet know how to solve that.  Of course, the most direct comparison we can make is to the 3D Mario games, which in my eyes hasn't had a single real dud yet. What do they do so differently? They're slower paced, sure, but take Mario 3D World - you can run through levels in that while holding a button, it's quick, takes real control and reflexes, and works. It's fun, challenging and fair. So maybe that's all Sonic needs to do - but even that's a big ask, because this game is on such a high level of quality. The controls, mechanics and level design in Mario games are all married to each other so well that making that game in a large team would have been a gargantuan effort. There's a reason not every studio pumps out games as slow but to as high a quality as Nintendo can - it's difficult. The slowness part of that sentence is the biggest side effect.  tl;dr - Sonic Generations era Sonic were the funnest 3D sonic games, but for completely different reasons to the 2D Sonic games, so don't solve the question. I really like Mirror's Edge."

gamedesign,3e5van,BLK_Dragon,5,Wed Jul 22 04:55:04 2015 UTC,"The closest I think we've ever come is the first Sonic Adventure, which really nailed the physics aspect of it. While the game was plagued with technical issues, the Sonic gameplay kept the core mechanic and translated it well. It should be noted that sonic is less about 'going fast' and more about preservation and management of momentum. By skillfully using ramps/slopes and dodging obstacles, you can gather speed and use it in empowering ways, like launching into the air and skipping parts of the level. It's kind of like a speedrun in a skatepark.  'Holding up' is a symptom of the 3d play space itself. The most intuitive control scheme for 3d platformers is camera-relative controls. Once you adopt this approach, the camera placement directs the input available to the player. The most player-empowering setups involve having the 'paths' through the level be at 45 degree angles from the camera. But since the player needs to see where they're going, the camera will usually rotate until it is tracking the player from the rear. Hence, 'holding up'.  I've spent an unholy amount of time playing both Sonic Adventure games, so I know the design very well. I started a demo in unity to try capturing the 'sprit' of those games while avoiding the technical problems like poor collision and a fussy camera, but it's slow work.  If you want to make a good 'sonic in 3d', my advice is to build off Sonic's gameplay in Adventure. Keep it to just his though, one of the major design flaws in the Adventure games is their attempts to cram multiple gameplay styles into one game. It distracted the team from fully comitting to any of them and really hurt the final product.  If you have any specific questions, don't be afraid to ask."
gamedesign,3e5van,gu1d3b0t,4,Wed Jul 22 05:15:56 2015 UTC,"Have you played Zineth? It's free. The world is somewhat open and you can get going really fast, and you can keep spamming the rewind power to ""perfect"" your run and never lose momentum. It's a game that's all about movement but doesn't devolve into a race or linear obstacle course. Their new game Perfect Stride is even faster. On the topic of skateboarding...  How about Tony Hawk? It doesn't quite reach the ludicrous speeds of games like Sonic or F-Zero, but it definitely has that momentum and twitch-reactions that make the action feel very fast. When you get skilled and start chaining together grinds and tricks, you can traverse the levels incredibly quickly while hitting precise objects and getting huge combos. Funnily enough, they made Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam which basically reduces the gameplay to ""Hold Up through this linear level"" and it's one of the worst games in the series.   There's also sort of a genre of multiplayer FPS games with super-fast movement (often by exploiting bugs). Tribes is probably the best-known modern example. There's strafe jumping and rocket jumping in Quake. Source Engine has surf maps. And surfing inspired the HL2 mod Perfect Stride Continuum which is the basis for that similarly-named game I mentioned earlier. There's some very niche FPSes like Nexuiz, Warsow, and the upcoming Strafe that intentionally replicate these weird movement techniques."

Learning how to ski around on the hills to dodge gunfire is probably my favorite example of 3D speed-based gameplay, but it's probably the only example I can think of that involves a character moving on foot on the ground. Anything else is probably an arial or spaceflight dogfighter.  Tribes is also good example of ""Hold Up"" not being the best thing to do. The more predictable the player's movements are, the easier it is for others to lead a shot. Seeing someone constantly weaving a bit and sliding behind and through obstacles while turning to fire behind themselves was a good indicator of player skill. Holding W wouldn't even increase your speed - building up speed was a matter of the angle you could hit a slope to redirect momentum gained by falling."

It's like having a cutscene in Last of Us."
gamedesign,3e5van,TheLivingShadow_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:34:07 2015 UTC,"Is that even a question that can be ""solved""? In game design, there's never 1 right answer or 1 solution. Even though 3d Sonic games have gone overboard with the roller coaster sequences in recent times, I still wouldn't call the ones I've played ""a movie in which the play button is 'hold up'"". There's still plenty of free-style platforming and fast-paced choice-making (High-mid-low route navigation is a pretty big part of going fast in Sonic games, actually). The ""hold forward to play"" sections were originally meant to be rewards for keeping momentum and taking the proper routes (Like skimming over the water in Sonic 2 GG/ Sonic 3 to skip underwater segments while dolphins majestically swim alongside you), but since one-button-3d-grafix-fireworks-shows are so pretty and sell so well now, Sega just kind of threw those sections all over their modern 3d Sonic titles as time went on.   Think about these basic design concepts from the Blue Blur's backlog when putting together a game with emphasis on speed:   Time: Sometimes I wonder if the most often forgotten mechanic in Sonic games is the timer. It's there, and technically you only have 10 minutes to beat the level. It SHOULD create a sense of urgency, but with most levels only lasting ~3 minutes even for the slowest of slow, it seems like it's only there to make sure you don't idle. Play with timers to keep people from stopping to smell the roses. Routes: In Sonic games, each level has 3 routes; A high route, a mid, and a low. The high route was the fastest and had the least amount of platforming (the closest to ""hold forward to win""), The mid was a bit longer and had a bit more tedious platforming to work with, and the low winds up being the most dangerous route, with lots of platforming and much more potential for deadly falls. When making a game about speed, remember that a big part of skill-based speed lies in being presented with multiple routes, and choosing the one you think will be fastest in the blink of an eye.  Scale: So you can get from one end of your living room to the other in 3 seconds. That's not fast! Running 100 acres in 10, though? Pretty fast. Your levels need to be big and open to showcase just how much distance your character is covering. There's nothing wrong with blowing through a building or 2, but being able to actually visualize the space you've moved through plays a lot into the fast mentality. Platforming: There is a large risk-reward deal with every platforming segment of a Sonic level. If you're on the high route and miss a jump, you'll fall to the mid and lose speed/time. If you're on the mid, you'll fall to the low and lose even more. And if you miss a jump on the low route, you will die. Take into consideration the risk:reward ratio for gaining speed and taking shortcuts.   The core mechanics and design have always been solid for a game about going fast, and most of what has ""gone wrong"" with Sonic games over the years has been purely aesthetic, 3D physics, pop-culture, and QA-related.   InMomentum is a great example of what 3D Sonic could have become if Sega cared more about gameplay than fireworks."

At the moment it gives the locations of nearby enemies but needs to be reloaded, it seems kind of a lame mechanics at the moment. However, I have been considering having it either give inaccurate information (i.e. it only gives a vague idea of where the enemies are), the potential for false positives (it can say there are enemies when there aren't) and/or it instantly gives away your position to those pinged, who, when I implement A.I., will have the drop on you.  Do you think this would be a good addition or an a bandaid on broken mechanics?  Additionally, you've mentioned that the enemy tends to have the upper hand if you walk into his view, what are you thoughts on a mechanic where an enemy has a delayed reflex, provided they aren't aware of your presence?

Of the two suggested ideas, I think I prefer the ping giving slightly inaccurate information.   As for the delayed reaction, I think that would certainly help. This, however, may have the effect of making your game partially stealth based, which you'd have to decide if you wanted to do.   As for the bandaid scenario, I can't offer enough information on that. I think there are successful games out there that a lot of people would say have these ""bandaid"" mechanic. There are also games that people would generally call bad that have very cool and interesting mechanics. That's a very difficult line to define."

Along with playing tons of X-Com and Jagged Alliance 2.  WEGO (simultaneous turn) has a couple of problems when compared to traditional turn based. Primarily the player is unable accurately plan actions or supporting actions. This has a bunch of knock on effects resulting in gameplay feeling unfun and random.   The Frozen Synapse solution is essentially to allow the player complete knowledge of enemy location, map, and their own movement capabilities. The challenge comes not from fog of war/what does your enemy have, but instead not knowing what your enemy is doing.  So the question is ""will that enemy gunner run left and into my trap, or will he run straight and catch my guy in the open?"". Those are the sort of questions the player had to contend with, I guess Chess would be the obvious comparison.  Combat Mission on the other hand gives you imperfect information. It is a wargame. You don't know what the enemy has or where they are at (within reason). You rely a lot on guessing your opponents intentions and capabilities and making choices based off of that. CM relies really heavily on a robust unit AI and player controls that allows them to make the proper decision when faced with problems. Without that robust AI the game would be incredibly frustrating to play."

gamedesign,3dzitc,Nachtfischer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty cool. In the context of the original question, what do you like about Invisible's tactics system, and does your own tactics system employ similar techniques?

It may be that your system is not anything like Invisible's but there was a lot in your descriptions that made me think of it."
gamedesign,3dzitc,AchromaticSky,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say the hallmarks of the Invisibles system is that it's a chess game, it's 100% deterministic matching of your characters special skill vs. the opponents.  As I've said elsewhere:   The feeling I'd ideally like to create is that of a professional and smooth tactical team breaching some building and quickly and deftly accomplishing their objectives before security is even fully aware of their presence (or later, with A.I. EVER aware of their presence). The key features, in my mind, of the experience are that your team is quicker, more prepared and has faster reflexes and accuracy and it takes the A.I. a while to get their s**t together but also near one-shot-kills both for you and the A.I. to create real difficulty and create a requirement of precision tactics rather than ""breach""-and-pray. To offset the frustration from such easy deaths the plan is to divide missions into a bunch of different ""floors"" and each floor is reasonably short, and one can restart the floor before moving on if they don't like the outcome.   Thus, ideally, what I""m aiming for is more of a tight, but brutal, tactical experience that lies somewhere between Frozen Synapse and Hotline Miami."

At least via Wine The ""End Turn"" button is too close to the edge of the screen making the map fly-by and turn ending an ambiguous gesture Full-screen gave x,y coordinates issues Lower resolution test-plays cut off the bottom bar with the selected weapon information and ""End Turn"" button   Recommendations:   Make the HUD positioning dynamic, sensitive to the viewport size. Use a percentage, rather than pixels to determine their distance from the edge of the screen. This will make mobile integration particularly easier down the road Make a key ""lock"" the view in place or one that alternates between a ""select"" and ""view"" mode. Using keys to move the mouse or a key to end turn would also work. There are a lot of potential solutions, really. Add a visible queue that shows what my character(s) will do when the turn ends. This would have made diagnosing the mismatched mouse coordinates much easier and facilitates an organic learning curve more forgiving than trial-and-error   Sorry I can't evaluate if your mechanic is ""boring"" right now but until these technical issues are resolved you could make the next Civilization and it would still just look like incoherent shapes on a grid."

No reason to hold onto them for later?  Obvious and poorly-thought-out ideas include: making the player perform specific tasks to earn more of the bubbles, or making the player perform those tasks after using the bubbles in exchange for the benefit they offer, like ""your next eight words must form a grammatically correct sentence"" or ""your next three words must be past-tense verbs"" or ""you must write the word 'bananas' by the end of this round"""

If you release a game with a sufficient playerbase, they will modify the game. This will happen independent of the availability of modding tools. Any lengths a developer goes to in order to intentionally impede a player's ability to modify the title will only waste valuable development resources and irk the gaming community... and if it's a sandbox title, that doesn't even make any sense to begin with.  That being said, most games with mod content do have some rules regarding the type of user-created content allowed, but these rules can't be enforced by the developer - it's up to the individual communities to disallow certain kinds of content. We've already seen what happens if the developers themselves encourage any sort of DRM with mods, and it wasn't good. On top of the immediate and overwhelming public backlash, people simply started pirating mods.  Trying to control cosmetic mod content is a wasted effort, especially for a sandbox."

I put the time into creating it.  I even had to invest in a siren that the spaceship kit didn't come with (no sound in space after all).  I had the help of my little brother too.  He chose yellow instead of red and I love this goofy Frankenstein of a vehicle even more because of it.   So now I'll ask again, which vehicle is better?

But mario maker and a couple of other titles do not allow you to share a custom level until you beat it yourself to prove that the level is beatable.  So, essentially, the player is allowed to do whatever crazy shenanigans they want with the mechanics. They can make something insanely hard or easy. They can make something you have to exploit glitches to beat if you want. As long as it's still beatable.  So in this way you can identify what the ""end goals"" of each part of the games content is, and allow them to do that freely.  You mention this in another comment. For example: the goal of a level 20 sword is to have at most a 2 star rating.  You can up the damage and have a super powerful weapon. Or take a weapon with half that and add a cool ability."

If you are going with instances you might as go with action combat like Tera/Vindictus.  Blocking or any kind of timing isn't that good of an idea if you aren't very slow like in Dark Souls and even then PvP in that game is kinda meh.  Also remember that any kind of passive blocking and dodging effectively just means more health for an opponent.  Definitely watch this video.  For really good combat you have 3 real choices. Either rip of wholly from fighting games, rip of wholly from CCG(collectable card games) or rip of MOBAs."

I think that video really brings a lot of things to life. There's no blocking, parrying, and ect, just timing your abilities to dodge damage and moving around. And true, throwing in the defensive methods as passives does increase the health which isn't necessarily a bad thing that doesn't automatically make it a good thing.  I think if I was to make a combat style it'd probably be something like in the video and do something similar to Tera/Vindictus. Thank's for showing me that video, it'll help with thinking about characters / abilities."
gamedesign,3dyvh4,Zeromatter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:20 2015 UTC,"I think one of the big distinctions you need to make here is what the goal of your game is. Is it a single player, combat-focused game? Is it a MMO? Is it an arena-PVP game? I mean without knowing your goal it's hard to give a good answer.   Things that may work for one genre might not work well for another. For example, WoW commonly has boss fights that feature multiple adds--maybe 10 guys that the off tank picks up. Can you imagine how frustrating it would be to have to manually block and dodge each attack? Yeah, you could scale it down to less adds, but things like that need to be taken into account.   Another thing to think of is what are you, the player, playing the game for? I'm not going to be playing WoW for the in-depth, tactical combat. I'm not going to be playing Dark Souls so I can get that piece of gear to increase my dps by 3%. You know?"
gamedesign,3dyvh4,adrixshadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have stated.  The game is looking to be a MMO somewhat RPG. The concept was to have the world be malleable that the characters can change the landscape. Examples would be setting up towns, kingdoms, and guilds provided they have the resources and numbers to do it. I guess a current example would be ArcheAge. You have Dungeons, Open world PvP and events, special bosses, ect.   True enough. I was thinking that there would probably be fewer adds with just higher stats/abilities so if you don't interrupt one of them there would be more of a consequence from that. But I see what you mean. For game play like that it would be better to keep everything passive so you could focus more on your abilities and positioning.  Hmm... From that point of view on why the player would be playing I never thought of classifying it to such an extent. I was looking to create something open (Think SAO, .Hack//Sign, Overlord, ect) where the players make the world. So I guess this would be more for creation.   Also with your comment about the manual blocking, that wouldn't really work in larger battlegroups that consisted of more than 2 people on each side. I guess a better place to start would be to figure out what I want the character to focus on? (I know that what I'm aiming to design/sketch out is very large and not at all possible but it's the dream and just looking to make the ground work)  Thanks for your thoughts /u/Zeromatter I might be making some other posts once I think about the concept and design.

I'm using the OHR RPG engine which is kind of dated but I feel very comfortable with it. It's so far been mostly me on the project but I am slowly assembling artists for future works that will be in and out of the game.   As I was working on it, I realized that it held more in common with JRPGs than WRPGs in that it's a linear story outside of the usual Tolkien fantasy trope. It's my own idea that I've had for a very long time about a small race of people (Smaller than a mouse) who have made civilization out of the ruins of humanity. The game has you running through a portion of this world to try and find the whereabouts of a mysterious arms dealer.   I've found a lot of help and inspiration from the youtube channel ""Extra Credits"" as I found their discussions to be extremely helpful is breaking down some core elements of video games. This is kind of what I meant by finding stuff that pertains to JRPGs specifically.

If it's dickish (there's not much of that in this sub) then just ignore it. I would always prefer ""honest"" to ""light,"" but I get it... it's nerve-wracking to put your ideas out there for others to see.  In terms of design, what I would recommend is based on my favorite RPGs--the Phantasy Star series--and I think that means I would approach this design slightly differently than normal.  Presumably you have a complete story fleshed out. If not, I would start there. At the very least, identify the plot points to your story--then use those as your framework for a larger design.  Designing a dungeon (or whatever the equivalent is in your game)? No problem. Ask yourself these questions:   Where is the player in the story? What do they need to accomplish here? How challenging should this be? What kind of rewards are there besides the primary goal? How challenging should they be to get?   Whatever plot point your reference is should be able to fill that in. Early on? Shorten the time to goal and generate weaker enemy encounters. Later in the story? Make the goal a long grind to reach.   RPGs like the one you're working on are really about managing resource depletion (i.e. Can I stay alive long enough to reach my goal?) and you should have some idea of what levels the player should be at depending on story progression. (Of course, this leads to some breaks by allowing players to level up and exceed what you'd anticipate, but that's a different discussion.) Once you've got that nailed down, you should be able to playtest your approach and tweak it to match what you'd like it to be. Too easy? Too short? Make the dungeon larger or fill it with stronger enemies. Too challenging? Too long? Etc.   When it comes to the level design itself, you're really free to do what you like. Here is a great resource for maze design. The one thing I would stress, however, is to make sure it's always clear to the player what they're supposed to be doing or where they're supposed to be going. These things will feel intuitive to you, but that's because you already know the answers. You must always be careful not to assume that a direction is understood. There's not many things more frustrating than knowing what to do next but having no idea how to do it. Imagine your player, standing there at a dead end, asking themselves, ""What am I supposed to do? What did I miss?"" This is what we're trying to avoid, and it's a bigger challenge in story-driven designs, because not everyone follows the story, whether intentionally or not. Context-sensitive clues (music, dialog, graphics, etc.) can help tremendously with this.   Hope that's helpful. Good luck!"

I'm actually getting someone with a creative writing degree to help edit it and make it flow nice. I've heard often that story should come later in the game creation process but I think it's really important in this genre.  Maze-like dungeons will be present but not routine honestly. I don't mind the occasional dungeon crawl and there is one very early in the game to act as a sort of first step for the player into the game world but most of it is going to take place in towns, complexes, and hideouts. I'm even going to have a level that's going to be reminiscent of trench warfare.  I plan on having a quest option in the main menu that will be a reference for what players have to do.

gamedesign,3dvn0r,Rotorist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. The answer is: I'm not sure.  The game will essentially be a single screen with 3 windows: the evidence file, the dialogue window/journal and the Manor map which shows the manor and its inhabitants.  The player can click on a room to search it, it is a shallow mechanic to tie the evidence collected to a room so just brings up everything you find. Not all of the items will be evidence so the player will need to determine if it is worth keeping.  The player can also click on a NPC to start a dialoge. Dialogue options are opened by collecting evidence and the NPCs attitude towards the player. Asking about a subject can be done in 3 ways, one neutral, one creating positive reputation, one negative. The overall reputation between NPC and player will change how they answer.  My end game idea so far is that when the player clicks the 'solve' button it takes you to The Parlor Scene where the player will make dialogue choices on the method, motive and finally make the accusation. If they get it right there will be a follow up on the conviction. If they get the culprit they will be notified that it fell over in court due to a poor case, if they get it wrong they will be notified that they have accused the wrong person."

gamedesign,3du1im,brisk0,4,Sun Jul 19 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"My suggestions based on what I can see:  First, try to reduce the number of effects, either possible or put limitations on number of effects or compatible effects.  After that, you could consider dropping consistency (icons) for context. Have poison change the colour of the health bar, have stun create electricity particles on the character etc. That should make it a lot less busy."
gamedesign,3du1im,brisk0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm I didn't think of that (using context instead of icons). I'll give your method a try! Thank you for the suggestion.  I've listed down the most possible combination of status effects for a character, and even 5 effects (5 icons) above the character's head may feel cluttered, especially if 10 characters are affecting by the same thing. So... I can't really reduce the number of effects.  I had thought of doing something similar to Final Fantasy Tactics', where the status effect icons rotate within a single bubble. However, that game isn't time sensitive, thus it's okay for the player to just wait and see as the effects show up one by one. This method wouldn't work for a game where everything is happening in real-time, I figured."
gamedesign,3du1im,catsonprozac,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Huh, the rotating icons isn't a bad idea, but you're right, definitely more suited for when you can wait and see everything."
gamedesign,3du1im,catsonprozac,2,Sun Jul 19 15:56:10 2015 UTC,Have you considered indicating status with colored dots. You can reuse the color to indicate status on enemies and stuff.
gamedesign,3du1im,najar-nurav,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"I did think of colored dots, but I immediately abandoned the idea. My reasoning being:  1) If there's 10 or 20 status effects, having 10~20 colored dots will still look cluttered anyway.  2) It's gonna be tough for color-blind players to identify too."
gamedesign,3du1im,brisk0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:03:53 2015 UTC,That's a lot. Will take focus away from main action. Since it will distract anyway might add well go MMO about it.   Have you tried. Docking the icons in a row on the edge of the screen? Or under the health or other primary hud item? Make grayed out/ semi tranparent for inactive?
gamedesign,3du1im,CrimsonMoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"I've looked into that, but it doesn't work because I wanted to show the icons for every character as well (including enemies). So... docking wouldn't work :("
gamedesign,3du1im,enalios,2,Wed Jul 22 03:17:29 2015 UTC,"You can take a look at the Battle of Wesnoth (open source, turn based) game. They give a nice implementation of showing status effects by modifying the character icons. They don't show any icons on the characters, only their HP bars. You can further view the details of the status effects in their respective character pages.  I understand your game is played in real time? I think you have a real problem here, in that, a player can simply not be expected to keep track of 150 odd status effects in real time. In real time gameplay, the player should be concerned with the macro environment, not the micro details.  As a solution, you should be looking at keeping the player aware of status effects without actually depending on visual cues (which may still exist). For instance, if the player knows that trolls inflict a stagger effect on every hit, then explicitly showing the status is not needed. And if, say, dwarves have immunity to stagger, then the player would know how to attack trolls, without having to go through the status effects being displayed."

gamedesign,3dm1jx,Lance_Fryar,4,Fri Jul 17 10:48:07 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Tamagotchis, there are two on my desk. ...With the little paper plug blocking the battery, those guys are way too needy for an adult.  The baby form needs a lot of care, but that's kind of like a video game: you sit down, turn it on (and baby hatches), and within an hour they change to the next form, which is ready to sleep overnight and eat regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They also need to play, on Tamagotchis it was a guessing game, in which you had to guess if the creature would turn left or right.  The creature's wellbeing seemed to be determined by their average food and happy meters. If you routinely filled the 4th and final peg on the meters, they would change into ""good"" forms, and if you let their meters fall very low, a full recharge could help somewhat but was never as good as constant top-off care. Leaving a poop on the floor had a chance to get them sick, and they would refuse to play or eat until getting a shot of medicine.  The original Tamagotchi had three buttons and no communications. On later devices, Digimon could fight by linking them together, or virtual pets could visit each other, etc.  My suggestion: bring in some modern but standard game concepts. Make playing the game with your creature pay some money. Spend the money on nice beds, food bowls with timers, more minigames or training equipment. Let other creatures ""visit"" and play with the toys. Make features to encourage people to play socially. ""I'm saving up for the hottub, since I can just use Jim's weight bench whenever we hang out.""  Maybe consider making the creatures smarter than the ""pet"" level of a Tamagotchi, and they could develop hobbies or crafting professions. I would've loved a Tamagotchi with a dwarf inside, and I made money by sending him on mining quests using a pedometer and selling jewels for kegs of beer.  Virtual pets are a time honored and beloved genre, don't let anyone dump on your idea with the whole ""I can't feed a creature or look at my phone all day"" spiel. Just set a difficulty level. ""Casual, your pet will get food out of the fridge when he's at 1 food left, you just have to keep the fridge stocked."" ""Hardcore: Your pet is bedridden and you have to wipe their sweat every 20 minutes."" That sounds dreadful but I think you can fathom the variance in between."

If for example, they needed fed every hour you would be forcing people to check their phone every hour which is unfeasible. I would estimate they would need to be fed twice a day minimum, but it might be worth researching other time-based mobile games to see if you can find out any average playing habits, which would allow you to tune the timings for maximum effect."

Of course a lot of the stuff is the same, but the whole structure around it is different.  As for learning, I'd first download Unity. There is a sample project called Angry Bots that comes with the installer. Open the project and get used to the different tools in Unity. Just play around in the editor. After that, you can open some of the scripts there. Try to find the ones that controls the character and what else you might seem is important. Then you can maybe try to modify it slightly so the player does something else or whatever. Take a look at the script reference. You can also google stuff if you don't know what exactly you're searching for. Then you take it from there. Start your own project and maybe make a simple 2D platformer or something. Expand your knowledge around the scripting, and maybe try different things like animating or something else."

Once you learn the basics of programming and C#, with things like loops, arrays, variable types, if else statements, etc, Unity will make it a thousand times more scarier because it bring in even more terminology. Start with simple programs like calculators, guess the number scripts, etc etc before you begin Unity. If you require very specific explanations you might want to pick up a voluntary tutor from a programming site like StackExchange or try to seek one out locally."
gamedesign,3djxhw,MTXreddit,3,Thu Jul 16 21:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think some simple questions to begin with would be, how would either system serve the narrative of the game?    I remember an example being given for Ico, in that part way through the game you are in a moat outside of the the castle you were struggling to leave with only a small embankment standing between you and freedom.  The main character could have easily climbed out, but that wasn't included in the game because it did not fit the narrative, and did not fit the character.  So, would the jobs/classes in your world require a degree of focus or specialization that would prevent them from branching out to other disciplines?  Would the character's personalities do this?  Would the game be more fun by restricting access to such powers/disciplines?  You could even mix and match, though at a greater degree of effort; everybody has their core focus, which they improve with by level/whatever, and their ""hobbies/extracurriculars"" that broaden their capability to overlap slightly with other classes.  In this case, one class would never be as good at another class's job, but could have some split competence.  Keep in mind that full- and partial-custom builds are much harder to balance than rigid character classes, since you'll need to check all possible variants for game-breaking combinations (or just leave that in as a feature and understand that some players will choose First Order Optimal Strategies, highly-optimized strategies, or self-burdened runs as part of their chosen experience)."
gamedesign,3djxhw,82Caff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies! Since the characters have very distinct personalities and the way they act, it would seem out of place for them narratively to be ""any"" class so to speak. So I may have some sort of dabbling, but if the battle style goes how they act within the story, then they definitely have specialties and preferences in combat."
gamedesign,3djxhw,GameMage,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"id go with set roles if you want it to be ideally strategic. Although versatility can have some positives it often leads to explotations or if the characters arent building a certain way very frustrating against certain bosses or lastly fights would be approached in many ways and lack stategic value.  Following this within the Final Fantasy series if you look at the games with characters having no set role or flexibility you get in particular 7, 8 and as you said 13. This can mean my cloud could theoretically be a mage (and only the limit break and the stats - which dont matter much) however the game narrative doesn't serve it that well as we see him constantly using his sword and slashing (also yes I know he was originally meant to be sorceror class).  FFX sort of has predefined roles but not in a traditional sense. For example Wakka is anti-air, Lulu anti-elemental, Rikku anti-mechina etc. It was much more effective and efficient to use characters to their role but you weren't entirely forced to (and with the expert sphere grid you could break the mould much quicker). I did a 10 min video on this but I dont wanna make it sound as if Im plugging it.  The issue with a lot of JRPGs having set roles is it typically boils down to damage dealer and healer. Especially since few JRPGs emply the third part of the MMO holy trinity - the tank. Usually support is lumped with healer or mostly ignored since they can't do a core function.  A way to possibly approach it would be to instead think of it as a puzzle - come up with some interesting enemies and then design ways the characters could defeat them. Sort of how one approaches a boss in MMOs. Such as if the enemy was only weak against magic - you would stack all mages but you could then make the enemy somehow counter only mage parties such as the enemy can one shot mages. So then allow the character to have a class than can cover or intercept or deflect such direct attacks? This could also fit well in with the narrative of having a noble knight.  Maybe have rows similar to Suikoden where the beefier characters are in the front and take first hits but can only attack the enemy front rows?  Maybe have some sort of combo system? Where like one character launches enemies in the air and another hits them in mid air for extra damage. Or have a real focus on armor/magic/power breaking enemies so it was more about attacking at the most opportune time than constantly wailing on them?  But yeah I do agree JRPGs do seem to lack that strategic element at times. Some have moments but very few have it constantly (which might be a good thing?).  Hope this helps. :)"
gamedesign,3djxhw,GameMage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"the specific thing I've been trying to design is breaking away from that dealer/healer issue.  Which is surprisingly hard :P. But I think the ""puzzle"" approach is what I've been doing to solve it.  In order to prevent characters from just healing and whacking at the enemy when they can, all the enemies have to have a  specific approach to be defeated.  I guess the thing I was worried about is that I only have 6 characters,  so I don't want options to feel too limited for the player. But hopefully then, if the player has an incentive to use every character, and there requires a lot more combinations of using each character's abilities than a normal JRPG would, then it should still be enjoyable and not so straight forward. Alright, thanks guys! Yeah, I think I have my answer :). Again, lots of design work to actually play around with, but I think that I'll go for the roles approach. Already laying things out in my head as I'm typing!  and I would actually really enjoy seeing your video, anytime there's game mechanics analysis involved I enjoy it.

I would rather you have roles to keep things dynamic rather then have clones with the same skills, that should be minimized whatever scheme you chose.  If the characters are locked meaning there is no rooster of characters that you select it might make sense to be locked in the classes and have their own individual development path.  However if there is any party selection you need more free form customization to make characters viable even if they game has ""roles"" you need in the party."

gamedesign,3dfykt,Nick_Cliche,3,Wed Jul 15 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"A fellow amateur Tabletop RPG designer! Awesome!   A few comments I have.  I feel the threshold for success is a bit low and would like to see it raised to 5-6 as a success as a standard. It would prevent nasty situation where the PC simply do not have enough dice to get enough success. It also tactical positioning and the Bidding Aspect further on, as warriors will nearly auto-succeed if they have 1 or 2 extra die than the required success number.   Instant skill gain: Sounds like a good idea, but I would be wary of it, because a class which tends to perform more rolls (like a warrior in combat) will ‘level up’ much faster than a social based character who tend to perform many less bonused rolls. You would have to keep that in mind while designing the progression system.  Tactical fatigue: There are a few way to increase the difficulty of an encounter in a dice pool system. You can increase the number of success needed, reduce the number of die in the player’s pool, or has you have chosen, to up the threshold for a success. Which one you ultimately choose will depend on what rational you explain the mechanics. The threshold in this case represents the individual’s skill at these types of tasks, and fatigue diminishes that skill. The frequency of accumulating fatigue can be a stamina or other physical attribute check at certain interval, or a guaranteed penalty after X number of rounds.  As for regaining morale in certain conditions, I find that trying to make a mechanic for every circumstance is a recipe for madness, which is why I’m very partial to generic reaction check (2d6, 2-3 is very bad, 4-5 is bad, 6-7-8 is neutral, 9-10 is good, 11-12 is very good) to deal with all those little edge case like a crowd chanting for or against someone.   Bidding: I quite like the idea of having to split your attention time (no of dice) between offense and defence. The taunt and intimidation could also be tied into the bidding mechanic, such as a successful intimidation could force the opponent to allocate 2dice to defence, thereby reducing their maximum potential offense.  The amount of forced die position could be determined by the degree of success on the intimidation or taunt roll.   Defensive die could be used either dodging or parrying. Dodging would require a success roll to remove one success for the opponent’s offense; where as parrying rolls would be a straight damage reduction. Dodging is not guaranteed to work, which again plays on the whole risk versus reward.   Spending combat dice to do other actions is a mechanic that I have never seen before, but I don’t think a 1die for 1die would be worth it for more action, especially since combat die are very valuable. I would think that having to spend 1 or max 2 dice to be able to do some other form of task during combat would be penalty enough, as having 2 less dice can be significant during a round. Players could then use their whole skill score by “paying” a dice tax.   Equipment: I prefer less random in equipment, as combat is already random enough. Also I fear you would be right that players would feel that they are fighting their equipment as much as they are the enemies. It would also mean having to roll a few extra dice for every attack, and that would get tiresome rather quickly with 4 or 5 players. I think weapons granting extra dice to either attack and defence, or allowing a fixed number of die reroll per combat would be a more elegant solution to different quality weapon and equipment without inflating the number of dice in the pool."
gamedesign,3dfykt,neophage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful feedback. Let me know if I am appear to have misunderstood anything in your replies and I hope I don't come across as overly critical:   I feel the threshold for success is a bit low and would like to see it raised to 5-6 as a success as a standard. It would prevent nasty situation where the PC simply do not have enough dice to get enough success. It also tactical positioning and the Bidding Aspect further on, as warriors will nearly auto-succeed if they have 1 or 2 extra die than the required success number.   A healthy adult swinging a weapon unopposed is likely to have some degree of success hitting the target. If the base skill for swinging a bat for the first time were set at four dice, and the target success were 4,5,6 it's likely that the bat-wielder will connect unless the defender takes steps to ensure otherwise. Also if the system does call for increasing target number based upon wounds and fatigue - there wouldn't be much room to model levels of fatigue and a 'winded' average fighter would be succeeding only on a six - the same success rate as a frail elderly person or small child.    Instant skill gain: Sounds like a good idea, but I would be wary of it, because a class which tends to perform more rolls (like a warrior in combat) will ‘level up’ much faster than a social based character who tend to perform many less bonused rolls. You would have to keep that in mind while designing the progression system. I agree - and assuming that combat occurs with the same frequency as a Dungeon and Dragons game - a melee weapon skill would outpace other skills. There would be an 'economy of skills' depending upon the setting and activities performed in a campaign. In a combat-heavy setting it would be possible that an 8-10 dice swordsman /rifleman would be considered a good fighter while someone with just 5-6 dice in a medic skill might be considered the best around. What problems might arise from this?  You can increase the number of success needed, reduce the number of die in the player’s pool, or has you have chosen, to up the threshold for a success.   I did consider reducing a dice in the pool to model fatigue but what I found was doing so put the player in position to be too tired to use some weapons but not another with which he has more skill.    Spending combat dice to do other actions is a mechanic that I have never seen before, but I don’t think a 1die for 1die would be worth it for more action, especially since combat die are very valuable. I would think that having to spend 1 or max 2 dice to be able to do some other form of task during combat would be penalty enough, as having 2 less dice can be significant during a round. Players could then use their whole skill score by “paying” a dice tax.   This is a very good idea. Thanks!   Hmmm... this looks a bit complicated. Have you actually played a scenario out with someone else? This might make it easier to see how the game would actually work.   This is the first time my idea has transcended an office scratch pad. I decided it's easier for me to design the game structures then see what genre(s) are suited to the mechanics. I have a pre-apocalyptic setting in mind but if the game takes me in another direction I will be okay with that.   edit: one question on defense: If a defender is faced with an attack, should the number of dice used for defense be declared before rolling and then that amount rolled? I am considering a system in which the defender, faced with an attack with three successes for instance, bids three dice for defense reserving the remaining dice for a counter attack. The defender's dice roll poorly and he only gets one success. He has the option to spend the one success to allow rolling the remaining dice. Alternatively, instead of a one die 'dice tax' for scrambling or making an on the fly change in strategy, I could have the cost influenced by a stat such as dexterity.  The defender rolls his remaining dice and successfully defends himself. However, the attacker left some dice in reserve allowing him now to strike unopposed (perhaps with a shield bash since the attacker's shield will not be used in this round because the defender is out of dice). Any thoughts on that?"

The die roll is to represent the ability of someone to hit with enough momentum to do damage on someone who is actively defending himself. Take for example two boxers, both equally talented. A success would not be landing a few jabs; it would be finding a way past his guard and landing a solid uppercut. They don’t happen every few seconds, and that is what you want to model, not an average man whacking a melon with a baseball bat. Remember also that you don’t need to model and represent a small child or elderly person in physical combat. It’s not a situation one would encounter, and you can’t make a mechanical to cover the whole spectrum of eventuality, it would simply be much too complex. But then again, it comes down to what the themes of the game are, if you want more high fantasy or realism.   In a combat-heavy setting it would be possible that an 8-10 dice swordsman /rifleman would be considered a good fighter while someone with just 5-6 dice in a medic skill might be considered the best around. What problems might arise from this?   The problem would come from the expectations of player and the difficulty design of the game. People tend to like large numbers, and most players do not like it when another players looks like is out-classing them. A soldier with 8-10 dice will seem more powerful than their 5 dice. You also run into the issue of having to balance each individual skill versus their expected. Skill less used will be at a higher total, therefore their respective difficulty needs to be lower. Losing 2 dice when you have 10 is not the same as when you have 5. This will be incredibly hard to balance.    I did consider reducing a dice in the pool to model fatigue but what I found was doing so put the player in position to be too tired to use some weapons but not another with which he has more skill.   Fatigue could be modeled in other ways. For example, you could force players to reroll a success die for every level of fatigue. With luck, someone could be unaffected by fatigue, or be heavily affected, but their dice total would not go down, and would therefore still potentially still be able to do anything they could normally do.    This is the first time my idea has transcended an office scratch pad. I decided it's easier for me to design the game structures then see what genre(s) are suited to the mechanics.   This is the opposite of what you should do IMO. You should come up with the genre and theme of the game you want. Only after that, can you get to work on the mechanics, because those genre and theme will inform you on what sort of system to use. Starting with the system first will net you with unfocused mechanic that do not seem to mesh well and does not convey the tropes of the genre you are making a game for. In a game, it’s not so much the math and the system that is important; it’s if the systems can convey the tropes of the genre. A zombie RPG with players able to mow through hordes of zombie with no risk would feel very off, while in a high fantasy it is expected for a fighter to kill countless goblins or other mooks. Same system, but vastly different experience due to the tone and genre of the game.  On defense: I would prefer a blind – single round bidding. For example, at the beginning of a players turn, they can chose to allocate 2 dice to defense and 3 to attack. They cannot change those numbers as the round progress, as it pretty much removes any risk in going all-out-attack. It also cuts down on the attack / counter-attack / counter-counter-attack thing going one. For simplicity’s sake, I always prefer when there is only 1 attack per rounds, instead of a back and fro every round. It adds too many dice rolls which I feel are unnecessary and detrimental to the flow of the game.   One thing I suggest you do for each mechanic is make a list of how else it could be done, and then find the reason WHY you chose the one you chose. It will help you understand the advantage of each, and what they can be used to represent thematically. For example, when it comes to health, will you use Hit Points, a wound tracking system, or deduct straight from the physical attribute?  Each have specific advantage and are better to represent some type of genre. HP is used very frequently for high fantasy, because it fits the trope of warrior taking deadly wound and keeping on fighting. Each mechanic must work with the genre, otherwise it will feel out of place and gamey."

The die roll is to represent the ability of someone to hit with enough momentum to do damage on someone who is actively defending himself.    If the defender does not have dice in reserve there is no active defense. Take for instance an untrained fighter who picks up a large spanner then commits all four of his dice in a desperate attack. He rolls a 2,3,1,3 - all failures. He overextends and swings wide leaving him flat-footed and exposed with no dice to defend from the counter attack. Risky gambits can carry a steep price especially among the unskilled.     Remember also that you don’t need to model and represent a small child or elderly person in physical combat. It’s not a situation one would encounter, and you can’t make a mechanical to cover the whole spectrum of eventuality, it would simply be much too complex   It's really not. It's a core part of the game. Take for example the elderly hermit warrior master philosopher trainer who amassed 12 dice of skill in his career however only succeeds on a 5 or 6 now due to his senescence. Players should be able to assess a threat predictably. If he's big he probably hits hard and can take a punch. If he's old he probably has lost a step but he has a lot of experience.    A soldier with 8-10 dice will seem more powerful than their 5 dice.   I have enough RPG experience to expect players to begrudge small points - but I can't describe a circumstance in which one player would compare unrelated skills. Players in a campaign share the same environment so if it were combat heavy, all the players would have opportunities to use and gain in relevant skills. The aptitude system would affect growth in particular skills since skill gain is immediate when all dice roll a success. The professor, medic, engineer, psymaster etc who might succeed on a 4,5,6 with their weapon won't have as much combat skill amassed as the marine who succeeds on a 3,4,5,6 however those players will have different aptitudes and abilities depending upon their background and stats.    Fatigue could be modeled in other ways. For example, you could force players to reroll a success die for every level of fatigue. With luck, someone could be unaffected by fatigue, or be heavily affected, but their dice total would not go down, and would therefore still potentially still be able to do anything they could normally do.   Not a bad idea.    On defense: I would prefer a blind – single round bidding. For example, at the beginning of a players turn, they can chose to allocate 2 dice to defense and 3 to attack. They cannot change those numbers as the round progress, as it pretty much removes any risk in going all-out-attack.   Skilled characters should be able to wheel and deal and adapt to changing circumstances as the round develops. Static dice allotments bring to mind two mechanical toy soldiers trading blows. The proof of concept I am trying to develop involves jabs, testing defenses, counters and feints. It would be interesting to see players commit just a couple of dice to see if the defender over commits and stumbles leaving the attacker an opening.     will you use Hit Points, a wound tracking system, or deduct straight from the physical attribute?   I like the Chaosium basic rules in which ability to take damage is derived from size and constitution and remain static throughout the player's career. I would like to further develop a wound system in which minor injuries cause 'fatigue damage' while more lethal wounds cause longer lasting, more debilitating consequences similar to how wounds are described in Harn."
