Chitoge,3ag8eb,nokayy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"well we are going to 300+ chapters(my estimate). so there's going to be more fun filler which I kinda like...   P.S. it's actually more fun if you stop reading it for a while then pick it back up, instead of this week by week chapter, could get a little frustrating for some.. :p"

Making fun of Chitoge isn't funny, and it's part of the reason why the amount of 'dera lovers is nearly ten times that of the Chitoge lovers. I expect no less than 5 cited sources.

Chitoge,38tdio,Mr_John_Pig,4,Sat Jun 6 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"It's never enough... I just read this for the comedy and if we get some development well then great.   Also I'm pretty sure Raku will not think twice about the ""what do you mean best friend"" comment cause in his mind she was drunk..   Also something I been noticing is that Raku has been putting all his attention on Onodera lately, in this chapter the only person he thought about was Onodera.. also in the chitoge is transferring arc he needed to be pushed by Onodera and Tsugumi to go after Chitoge.. I miss the old days where he would rather save Chitoge than hold Onodera's hand... also with the last Onodera arc, I hate to say it but for the first time I'm beginning to think the Chitoge ship is starting to sink.... :( feels like Komi is switching the story to get a Onodera end girl ending cause she is more popular...   P.S. I'm gonna stay away from the /r/Nisekoi for a while to let things cool down..."
Chitoge,38tdio,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jun 6 17:44:58 2015 UTC,Nah. Think about it. We all know Chitoge will end up with Raku in the end. She is practically the promise girl. For a few reasons. And she's also the poster girl of the franchise. Let's wait for the ship to sail even further when she gets her next arc. I wouldn't worry about it.
Chitoge,38tdio,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jun 6 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"I think Onodera has taken over as the poster girl, she is way more popular on all those polls they make, even Marika is more popular than Chitoge. (Which is why Onodera is the main girl in the spin off). and Raku has been a complete disappointment when it comes to noticing Chitoge at all lately.. I just think everything is pointing to Onodera end girl even though Chitoge  is the promise girl... ."
Chitoge,38tdio,wardaniel9,2,Sat Jun 6 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless, Chitoge is going to be the person Raku will end up with."

Chitoge,38tdio,wellherpsir,2,Sun Jun 7 04:26:01 2015 UTC,She'll bounce back with a new arc.
Chitoge,38tdio,QU1CK5TR1K3,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that Nisekoi probably isn't going to end anytime soon. Plus, if you know anything about the cliche's of how stories and characters go/develop, it's pretty obvious that Chitoge will end up with Raku.  Unless Nisekoi pulls a ""Shuffle!"", but that's doubtful."

Chitoge,35rr6k,wardaniel9,3,Wed May 13 01:09:29 2015 UTC,"How is she the promise girl? Her design is weird also. Not to mention she hasn't had enough development yet. Even though she's been in the series for 100 chapters AND that she won't be the one ending up with Raku. I also thought she was 12 at first because of her design.  She's an okay character. (Not like I ship her with anyone in the series. Not even Shuu because we all know who belongs with Shuu.)  Someone once told me the only reason why he/she liked Haru so much is because ""Cuz she pruddy wat else want you?"" he/she was the mod of /r/Nisekoi."
Chitoge,35rr6k,wardaniel9,3,Wed May 13 01:25:20 2015 UTC,Not to mention she hasn't had enough development yet.   thats just not true. she's had the most development in the series apart from chitoge.
Chitoge,35rr6k,EagleStrike411,2,Wed May 13 07:05:40 2015 UTC,"Jesus, we just had this conversation a while back didn't we. we are just going in circles now. WHAT is it that you want, don't you have things in real life that you like and no one else likes and you don't even know why you like it but you just do.... well let's just say thats Haru for me or any other person... it's unexplainable.."
Chitoge,35rr6k,burzerk,1 point,Wed May 13 01:56:14 2015 UTC,Oh it's you! Last time you said it was Onodera though. I can respect opinions. BUT I will have to ask a question as to why they think they. One opinion means I can argue my opinion against it.
Chitoge,35rr6k,leboulanger007,1 point,Wed May 13 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter who it is, the fact that your saying you can only like Chitoge because she is the main character, has the most development, is the promise girl, story is about her, she is going to end up with Raku in the end, etc, etc... is crazy...... you and anyone else can like who ever they want and not have to justify it to anyone else.... why.. why... why do I do this to my self.... (putting phone down and slowly walking away)...."
Chitoge,35rr6k,Yusumay,2,Wed May 13 02:19:31 2015 UTC,I feel sorry that you wrote that on a phone. I just want an explanation on why you think Haru is the promise girl (even though last time you said it was Onodera.)

Chitoge,31aj7l,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 14:14:13 2015 UTC,"No. Not complaining. Just a plain and simple opinion.(That might come off as a complaint.)  Her cheeks and nose are so different from original chitoge's design that those drawings look kinda weird. (To my eyes. I don't know about the rest of the world.) I just cannot accept the last two pics as chitoge's. I know many people will disagree with me. (And they perfectly have a right to.)  But I just think that in an effort to draw more realistic chitoge they created something...... umm how do I say this......... something very non-chitoge.  Now I'm going to say something that might sound ridiculous to you but I can accept this amateurish design as chitoge. But not those day 36 and 37 pics. You see I'm not talking about pics being good or bad, I'm just saying that they don't give the CHITOGE-feel."

Chitoge,2wlirm,ultimat3spaz,1 point,Sat Feb 21 06:30:55 2015 UTC,"Now now mr. mod, we seem to be having a misunderstanding here. In no way would I say that neither my post, nor comments go against your rule set.   I have fulfilled the first note, and made a post about Chitoge. My comments mentioned other girls, which are allowed according to rule 2. Even if you interpret my insinuation as negative towards Chitoge, it would still be far too vague to be in breach with rule 2. Just from how rule 3 is formulated; I assume that we're both aware that that one haven't been broken. No NSFW, so that one is also clear.  Rule 4 is ehhh..... okay maybe this one a little, but that should be general knowledge at this point.  We can probably work out an agreement to our situation here, as I'd prefer as much as you not to have to drag this false accusation and defamation case through court. I'm fine with settling on a custom title or flair, as well as an apology in full dogeza. If you you still want to take this up to court, be prepared for the fact that you might lose your position in this society. Not that I would care  /s"

I've got a good bit of free time right now so I could probably do it.  Edit: I actually made another version of that picture where I corrected the colors of the foods. Someone told me what they were and gave reference pics. I'll redraw either one depending on your preference."
Chitoge,2qkx3b,sigmastorm7,3,Sun Dec 28 04:39:56 2014 UTC,Oh no I couldn't ask that of you. Although I must say since I made this post ive come to like it so much it's actually my phones home screen right now but thank you so much for being so considerate.  Edit: The foods look very vibrant in that picture. Did you do the original coloring??
Chitoge,2qkx3b,sigmastorm7,2,Sun Dec 28 05:24:35 2014 UTC,It's not big deal. I've actually started redrawing for a scan team so I could use the practice anyway. It would be easier than you think.
Chitoge,2qkx3b,sigmastorm7,3,Sun Dec 28 05:36:33 2014 UTC,Awesome. Thanks. Would you guys need translators by any chance?
Chitoge,2qkx3b,sigmastorm7,3,Sun Dec 28 05:38:11 2014 UTC,"You know, I'm not sure. I only inquired about redrawing since I don't know Japanese. I can ask if you want though. And about the edit to your previous comment, I did both of these colorings. The second one was an edit to fix my incorrectly colored foods. Also, I saw on your other post asking for this pic someone replied with an entirely redrawn version (I had nothing to do with that one). If you prefer the manga version I will redraw it, but if you like the other one better that's fine too. It won't hurt my feelings."
Chitoge,2qkx3b,sigmastorm7,3,Sun Dec 28 05:50:42 2014 UTC,I speak fluent Japanese so I was just curious. I would absolutely love the manga one that you did. That would be so great. You are a very talented artist.   Edit: I honestly love the manga one you did more but I didn't think I'd ever be able to find it without the text so I psyched myself up into using the redrawn one although to be perfectly honest I really don't like it as much simply because the colors look so much better in the one you did.

Chitoge,2q6n2s,kaidynamite,2,Wed Dec 24 05:39:29 2014 UTC,You pick a playable character (Like naruto) and then you choose an assist character like chitoge and in the middle of combos she can come in and whoop ass along side you!   There were a couple mods I saw that replaced some of the playable character models with chitoge's model so if you're into that you can try it out when it comes out this summer.

Chitoge,2h9w17,MattLib,2,Wed Sep 24 01:11:00 2014 UTC,Meh if not this round then we would have gotten knocked out by senjougahara next round anyway. Atleast now i dont have to destroy my soul over whether to vote for gahara-sama or chitoge. Now i can wholeheartedly and happily vote for hitagi so that yoko can GTFO
Chitoge,2h9w17,kaidynamite,2,Wed Sep 24 00:15:49 2014 UTC,We must declare war.

Chitoge,2h0hnx,wellherpsir,1 point,Sun Sep 21 13:58:18 2014 UTC,How is the game?
Chitoge,2h0hnx,MattLib,2,Sun Sep 21 16:23:29 2014 UTC,"Well, gameplay is basically non-existant. You touch whichever girl you want to, and with that get cards which give you points to spend on costumes. When touching, you also get some unlockable voice clips, from a default pool as well as costume-specific.   In the end, the entire game is basically (best girl) fanservice. I'm loving it."

Chitoge,2gofwj,wellherpsir,2,Wed Sep 17 20:57:37 2014 UTC,From Amazon.  They also have Shitodera if that's what you're into.  Supposedly there's a Tachibana and Tsugumi one too but I don't see them on Amazon.
Chitoge,2gofwj,wellherpsir,3,Wed Sep 17 21:06:18 2014 UTC,I lost it at Shitodera.
Chitoge,2gofwj,Purper,2,Wed Sep 17 21:58:42 2014 UTC,She's not even best Onodera. It's like she's not even trying.

Chitoge,2gmv88,Phnglui,2,Wed Sep 17 10:05:18 2014 UTC,"Japan still tends to believe heavily in strict gender roles, so Japanese men like quiet women who stay at home.  Onodera is very housewifey, and that's what Raku prefers."

This is clearly a disguised acronym most likely reading as follows: Foxes Enter Forests 4 A Drink.  This statement is true. Everyone gets a little thirsty sometimes. Even foxes. What's in a forest? Bodies of water.  Water has 5 letters. But what they don't tell you is that money does too.  What is money used for? The funding of Nisekoi, donations to charity, and possibly the purchasing of socks for little baby foxes with cold feet (WHO MIGHT ALSO BE THIRSTY. HINT).  Cold feet are similar to someone giving you the cold shoulder. The cold shoulder is mean. Mean backwards is Naem. Unscramble it. What do you get?  That's right. Name Mane. What are manes related too? Lions. Lions symbolize power and wisdom.  But how does this link to KFung's image? Who the fuck knows but that shit is pretty darn good man.  #GetProved"

Ive never had a max factory figure and ive heard many good things about them, and theyve finally made a figure that i have room to pay for and i want."

Chitoge,2fde4r,heram_king,2,Thu Sep 4 03:41:29 2014 UTC,Thats the actual truth lol. I want both. Two of best girl is better than one of best girl. Which other alter figs do you have?

Banishment is quite harsh.   Rules:  Only post about best grill Chitoge  No ranting or hating of true Godess Chitoge  NSFW posts ARE allowed, but please tag them!  Don't be a shit-face. Seriously.  Low quality posts, such as advice animals, memes, and rage comics are not allowed.  So then by these rules, it doesn't seem like he broke any of the subreddits rules."

Chitoge,2dlbss,zshanif,3,Fri Aug 15 00:39:08 2014 UTC,"Pretty good attempt! A few suggestions I would make would be to change the background, because the pink tips on that color make it look like her hair is fading into the background, it's a little distracting. Also with flat vector art, one thing to keep in mind with future designs is skin touching skin (ie her hands on her chin) can become a complication and cause the image to look like it's blending.    All in all besides my minor notes it looks good! Keep it up!  One last thing to note though is this technically isn't minimalism.   This comment and the comment directly below it is a good example of explaining the difference: http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/274m1z/am_i_doing_this_right/chxclmr"

I've been converting the Nisekoi manga to PDFs for my own use, but why not share? I've only converted Chapters 50-110. Chapter 50 was basically where the anime ended. There are about 130~ish Chapters currently released, as far as I know, but I got lazy and stopped converting them a month or two ago."

Chitoge,2d1xfu,sschitoge4lyfe,3,Sat Aug 9 07:00:09 2014 UTC,"Hi, I just came back from Japan a month ago, bought quite abit of nisekoi stuff also.  Most of the Nisekoi stuff I found was at Nagano Broadway. There's a poster shop at level 2, and there're multiple Nendroid and gacha figurine shops there. I'm not sure if the nendos are out yet but there definitely are Nisekoi gacha figurines for sale there.  In Akiba, I didn't find as much Nisekoi stuff(I mainly went there for the NGNL exhibit playing cards, actually :P) but theres a cospa shop with Nisekoi T-shirts above Card Kingdom, as well as another smaller T-shirt stall right next to a Curry rice shop. Its located just outside the JR station of Akiba, opposite some giant family restaurant.   I'd also reconment going Animate at Akiba, they've quite abit of Nisekoi stuff for sale there. Sorry for my shitty instructions in giving directions, and hope you have a great time in Japan!"

I do not have CSS experience, but I am absolutely willing to learn. On the moderating front, not on this website, but I do teach middle school, and I am sure all of our like minded Chitoge-fans are going to be easier to deal with (and similarly stubborn) than 7th and 8th graders.

Chitoge,2ce7nl,Jordy56,3,Sat Aug 2 06:34:52 2014 UTC,Yes re-doing the whole contest.  More girls lost to this trick.  I plan to create a special poll to prevent the cheating.

Chitoge,2ce7nl,Pikawil,4,Sat Aug 2 07:07:22 2014 UTC,"This is bullshit! Taiga alone? Ok, guess Asuna may beat her. Chitoge alone? I guess it could be (and was) a close fight. But Asuna beating both of them? Fuck off. And this is from a SAO, Toradora and Nisekoi fan. Anyway xD This was fun."

Don't hate me for speaking the truth. It won't happen.  Lol I'm sure we'll get em all. Might as well crown the army. Free 172 votes every time.  I'm getting tired of this bullshit hater downvoter. Time to bust out the big guns. New Coded rules.

Chitoge,2c3u91,ASCKawaII,1 point,Wed Jul 30 03:40:42 2014 UTC,"How could you :,<"
Chitoge,2c3u91,Xaftz,1 point,Wed Jul 30 03:42:57 2014 UTC,It doesn't even take up that much space...
Chitoge,2c3u91,sigmastorm7,1 point,Wed Jul 30 04:37:04 2014 UTC,As soon as I learn Japanese I will start playing.
Chitoge,2c3u91,sigmastorm7,2,Wed Jul 30 03:09:40 2014 UTC,Knowing Japanese isn't required to be able to play it. The only way the small amount of Japanese I know has helped me is in knowing what some of the costumes were without looking them up.
Chitoge,2c3u91,sigmastorm7,1 point,Wed Jul 30 03:14:13 2014 UTC,Is there actually an english version?
Chitoge,2c3u91,sigmastorm7,2,Wed Jul 30 03:18:34 2014 UTC,Nope!
Chitoge,2c3u91,MattLib,1 point,Wed Jul 30 03:20:27 2014 UTC,So you're basically just guessing at what some stuff is? Or do you know a fair amount to get by?
