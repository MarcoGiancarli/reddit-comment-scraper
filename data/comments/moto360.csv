moto360,3e0x4u,knirp7,7,Tue Jul 21 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, I purchased it on eBay for cheap - here's a link. It's a nice looking band but it's admittedly a little flimsy; you get what you pay for.   I'll swap it out for an official ""Mono link"" band if they ever sell the damn things separately.  EDIT: As others have pointed out, this cheap band can contribute to the back of the device cracking faster than it would under normal wear conditions. Buy at your own risk!"

Do away with all those minutes and hour numbers that aren't being used, remove the 0 F, because the user knows what scale they chose, and remove the percentage symbols by the battery levels, because again the user knows it's showing percentages and it just clutters the screen.

moto360,3dza8w,3rt41,4,Tue Jul 21 09:39:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, it's weird how ambient mode works on the Urbane.  I don't know if it's the watch, or the specially designed watchfaces from LG, but when it drops out into ambient, it doesn't appear to dim at all and remains in full colour. The only things missing from the active face are the seconds hand and the glimmering when watch moves effect.  So to all intents and purposes, yes, it's pretty much like having the watch always on. And it gets through a day like that. I think the fact that it has an OLED display really helps with the battery life over the 360."

moto360,3dza8w,GuyInA5000DollarSuit,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:57 2015 UTC,I had a similar experience when I got a G Watch and SW3 in the span of a few days.  (G watch was $50 deal and SW3 was amazon warehouse deal).  The thing I noticed the most?  Above the speed and different screen types and bands and all that?    The battery life.  WTF.  It blows my mind that the G Watch can just chug along and I can get home with 60% battery and the SW3 can have 75%+ with either of their screens on all day.  The SW3 has that crazy traflextive LCD so it's not apples to apples.  It gave me perspective on the Moto360 that I didn't have before.  It looks fantastic but I wear it only for dates or short trips.  My work horse is the SW3.

Also it did charge quick so I could come home from work and charge in like a half hour to have enough for the rest of the day. But that full day with Urbane is with the screen always on. A big part is the oled screen.

moto360,3e2fde,kalifornia124,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:27 2015 UTC,I think the notification mode effects both phone and the 360. So if you have it on priority only for your phone it'll be priority only on your watch. Mini launcher controls the phone's volume.

moto360,3dwrsw,clever_screename,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:14 2015 UTC,It looks like the Air 540 to me.
moto360,3dwrsw,lurkingmygurkin,4,Mon Jul 20 20:52:14 2015 UTC,That is just so freaking cool. Nice work.
moto360,3dwrsw,ferretflip,4,Mon Jul 20 06:20:29 2015 UTC,"This is awesome! What do the cables look like that lead into the back of the dock?  Also, is your watch upside down?"

moto360,3dwrsw,Reverp,3,Mon Jul 20 05:13:09 2015 UTC,This is gorgeous! You should x-post to /r/diy What qi charger did you use? I think I want to do this myself.
moto360,3dwrsw,Popeskill,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Nice Momentums! Wearing mine along with my 360 right now. You have good taste in electronics. Do you have any other pair of headphones?
moto360,3dwrsw,Reverp,2,Mon Jul 20 07:45:13 2015 UTC,"Sure do, but nothing too exciting. These are really my first proper set. I have some Koss DJ100 for work and portable listening and a Razer Tiamat 7.1 which was a boxing day impulse buy. They're 'okay' for something that supports 7.1 and has a built in Mic, so I used them for gaming for a while but eventually I decided to upgrade to the Momentums and a Blue Snowball desktop mic instead. I Definitely don't regret that switch."

It's like the nastiest. cheapest charger/cable combo.. twin core cable.. urgh..   what's so special about the US one?
moto360,3e086p,cpitchford,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:45:55 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have the exact same one as the US model then.  It just puts out 500mAh so it's not really good for much except charging your phone very slowly or your watch...
moto360,3e086p,quotemycode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:51:25 2015 UTC,Sounds the same as mine. I just like that it's all in one instead of me having to go out and buy a wall outlet adapter to match. I actually liked the charger.

If you are using a custom watch face where tapping certain areas bring up certain actions (eg. open calendar events etc.), tapping the same area with the drop down menu open will have problem registering."
moto360,3dumu3,mliou,4,Sun Jul 19 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"This is almost exactly true.   It appears to be a bug within WatchMaker, regardless of the features of the watch face that's active. As a test, try to tap the same area, just on your watch face. The tap is ignored just the same. Easy to reproduce once you learn the area of the screen that's affected.

moto360,3dta7a,Holographic01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:48:16 2015 UTC,What are the problems with it? Me and a friend were talking about this handset at work last week and we're both tempted as our Nexus 4's are getting a little shabby!
moto360,3dta7a,chicaneuk,4,Sun Jul 19 08:12:40 2015 UTC,"They're a hit or miss I seem to be the only one so far with these problems (that i have seen at least)  For starters, the most annoying problem :  -My volume down button is tied to a back button command. No idea how that's possible but when i press volume down it acts as if I'm pressing the back button and volume down. It does in in bootloader mode and recovery too so it's not software  -I have two big white dots on my screen, looks damaged but only visible on white backgrounds -Bad overheating near the fingerprint sensor which throttles the phone (switching roms helped a lot)  -Both cameras are pretty shoddy, the ""5mp"" front camera takes as good a photo as my ipod touch 4g (0.3mp) no joke. Back camera is decent but when exposed to too much light it gets a red tint in pictures  -No developer support, no source codes for the chipset which means no roms besides like 2 modded stock roms  Pros:  Sweet, premium feel. Looks like an Iphone mixed with an HTC phone and you can definitely see it and feel it.  -Great screen, better than my G2 and my Note 3's screen  -Almost stock android, only has a few added custom apps from Elephone  -Rootable and you can get Xposed which make up for the lack of roms  -Fingerprint scanner is pretty good   -Notification light is spot on!  -Battery life is pretty good too!  Honestly, take any reviews you see on this phone with a grain of salt, QA is literally non existent i would say so if you get a bad phone then damn good luck, they'll take months to get it fixed for you (weeks if you're lucky from seeing online complaints). Don't get me wrong, for the price it's pretty good and I'm liking it.  My suggestion to you would be to get a better phone for a bit more then possibly being disappointed with this one. The Asus Zenfone 2 is a great start ($300, unlocked, good specs and with 4gbs of ram) or the ZTE Axon Phone ($450, unlocked, Snapdragom 810, 4gb ram, dual cameras, 8mp front facer, HIFI audio, and QHD screen). These are so much better and have waaaaay more reviews. Might want to wait though, the Oneplus 2 and Moto X 2015 are being announced on the 27 and 28th of this month!"
moto360,3dta7a,Holographic01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:28:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the mega comprehensive response :) I think I'll wait it out too - like you say, a lot of new handsets due soon - think new Google Nexus handsets are due in the coming months too.

moto360,3dvp9w,Theelichtje,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:38 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what important data you could've had on it, but your time is probably already up now.  Theoretically, if you'd thought of it, you may have been able to wifi tether with the watch (not sure how wifi works with 30 feet of water though) and do something that way...But by now the battery is certainly dead, and no one will ever find it.  Even if they did, there's no way it and a ziploc bag can survive at the bottom of a lake for years.  EDIT:  Oh, you're a troll, fuck you."

moto360,3dv9ox,KINQQQQQQ,3,Sun Jul 19 20:28:35 2015 UTC,Is it charged all the way up? If the battery is too low it won't perform the reset.

moto360,3dv9ox,Dexter79,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:20 2015 UTC,90% should be plenty of battery. You can contact Motorola and they might be able to replace it for you. They were going to replace mine for the cracks in the back but I decided to exchange it at Best Buy.

I was hesitant to buy one, didn't think I could cope with the battery life of a smartwatch (I've worn solar powered watches for the last decade or more). I can say with certainty that I will be owning another android wear device.  However, they would not honor the warranty for me. Initially I went on live chat on their website and was offered the same deal as you were OP was, put deposit down and get a new device in exchange for the old. When they realised I was not in the US I was passed to the service department appropriate for my region. I live in Ireland, not exactly the Himalayas or some inaccessible desert. Was given an address to 'post' the watch to and strongly advised to insure the watch first for accidental breakage and loss. They also told me that the repair center would most likely refuse the repair and that was all they could do.  I don't mean to diminish your post OP, I'm delighted to hear of companies conducting themselves properly, just to point out to others viewing this forum that this policy does not extend to all customers."

I can understand if they do not have a presence in a particular country they may be reluctant to cover international shipping costs but A) I'm not in some remote village in the Amazon or something. B) Shipping costs would be small in comparison to the cost of the device anyway and C) I would have been willing to ship it to the UK myself if only that option had been available. Surely they extend the same warranty standards to their UK customers as those from Americaa? Or maybe they don't and that's also part of the problem.  Bottom line on it is I linked a photo to a US rep and it was 'No problem sir'. Linked the same photo to the UK rep and it was 'I'm very sorry sir, Nothing we can do'  The way it turned out I ended up modifying the back as I've seen others here do so as the straps do not put pressure on it. Definitely no warranty now. As I've told Ryan, this definitely affected my opinion of Motorola and since these aren't exactly cheap toys to buy I'm sure it will seem a bit risky to buy a Motorola device again.  Now the mind boggling bit of it all is my Nexus 5 started giving trouble. Google sent me a new phone and a shipping label to return the old one...and google aren't even properly in the hardware business, the Nexus line is intended for developers only."

Different mechanics same visual effect. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_persistence  In Moto 360's case this is mixed with heat related issues from the charger, due to the way the device is assembled. After a while not only does the charging animation start to permanently burn in, you also get blemishes and ""stains"" from the hottest pcb components behind the Moto's screen. Most owners that see these blemishes report them to be similar in size, shape and position.  TLDR: It does, permanent burn-in is more prominent in moto360, just search this subreddit."

It also has to do (maybe to a lesser extent) with how large your wrist is.   If you've got a very small wrist (the edges of the watch are hanging off your wrist), and you're wearing it tight, then you would stand a greater chance of having the back crack than someone with a larger wrist wearing it loosely."
moto360,3drk3l,PhillipMB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:21:58 2015 UTC,Hard to say. I bought a silicone band from Tylt that was 'made for moto' and a month later it has cracked all the way across the back. I'll buy the next version 360 but will stick to their straps.

moto360,3drk3l,spark1223,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:40 2015 UTC,I've had three and used multiple bands and two have cracked pretty quick. I'm a couple months into my third with the steel connect adapters and all seems well with the stock leather band.   For what it's worth I wear it behind my wrist joint rather than in front. I'm sure that's what cracked my first one. The second took longer but still cracked. We'll see what happens this time but I feel like it's less likely because of the way the adapters work.

moto360,3dpojf,altimax98,2,Sun Jul 19 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"I believe in 2nd chances. He just opened his seller account and a negative remark as a first review is a death sentence on Amazon.  He also was very prompt in responding. Not everyone especially older people look at their watch screen compulsively looking for imperfections. Now if he tried to weasel out of it or not respond at all, I'd still win by disputing with Amazon and getting my money back. And then a 1 star review explaining his deceiving practices would be due."

moto360,3do1l6,totalBS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:50:31 2015 UTC,Bigger battery AND higher resolution will kind of equate the whole thing... hence the Nexus 6 having a larger battery but the higher resolution display is the biggest contender in evening it out with the other flagships. If the screen stayed the same resolution and the battery increased this would make for a phenomenal device. It honestly doesn't look too pixelated at the moment.
moto360,3do1l6,maximumhamburgers,8,Sat Jul 18 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"Battery improvement , speaker, and at least an IP68 rating would be nice"

moto360,3dcyu2,Caldehyde,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Watchmaker or Facer. I perfer watchmaker for creating, it's quite a bit friendlier and the docs are well updated. Facer is just as powerful though"
moto360,3dcyu2,V17Ds,3,Wed Jul 15 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"I think he meant actual watch faces, through the Android JDK."

moto360,3de5kw,mrkeyboard,10,Wed Jul 15 15:50:51 2015 UTC,I use Sleep as Android and it works great. Typically I’ll charge the 360 as I’m getting ready for bed and in the morning as I’m getting ready for work. My experience is that it’ll go through 35% or so of my battery as I sleep and it’ll charge in about a half hour or so in the morning so it’s not too bad.   The sleep analysis works well and will wake me up at the appropriate time in my sleep cycle so that I’m not as groggy. Another benefit is that I have my phone silent and the alarm will gently wake me by vibrating on my wrist so that my wife never hears a thing.  I would suggest pressing the side button twice to put the watch into theater mode right before going to bed too.
moto360,3de5kw,surg3d,2,Wed Jul 15 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"I've been using sleep as android for about a week now and I'm getting just about the same battery levels.   OP just give your watch a few days for the battery break in period, then see if it works for you. I pop it on the charger when I wake up and within 30 minutes it's fully charged again."
moto360,3de5kw,CaptainMoustache,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get through a full night using sleep as Android either, and that was after a 100% charge before going to sleep. I also (always) have ambient mode turned off.  That was once and I never tried again and never tried a different app; I've been meaning to do so."
moto360,3de5kw,lostshootinstar,2,Wed Jul 15 21:39:02 2015 UTC,You have to put the watch in cinema mode to conserve battery. My watch is usually around 80% before I go to sleep and 50% after using sleep as android.
moto360,3de5kw,simplyswole,2,Thu Jul 16 11:00:05 2015 UTC,"Had a jawbone up for sleep tracking (and other stuff). JB got broken, thought I could rely on the Moto 360, too inconvenient (mostly due to the short battery and rather bulkiness), got myself a Jawebone up 2. Just my experience."

Better than paying $70 for Moto's version."
moto360,3ddual,hpower,5,Wed Jul 15 14:25:08 2015 UTC,same.  my watch wifi hardly...if ever...kicks in.
moto360,3ddual,andyboy16,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the first time you use wifi on the device, you need to use your phone to activate the wifi (unless it's an open hotspot). After that, you have to have wifi enabled in the settings of Android Wear on your phone. It will automatically turn off wifi after a while to save power, but it should periodically check for notifications."
moto360,3ddual,quotemycode,2,Wed Jul 15 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Same thing started happening to me today as well. My watch was at 89% battery and I got a notification that wifi had been turned off to conserve battery. I swiped to the left to re-enable and it did nothing. Prior to today wifi would only turn off when the batter got <50%.

That's what I've done, and I could only presume it would also share the time stamps of each background change.  You have to copy the code from the link I shared, and then use it inside the app at the bottom.  I can't recall the option, something like ""Paste code from site"" or something.  Then I assume all the times would be there when you go to edit backgrounds."

There is no ""late in the game"" with Ingress. Portals are constantly changing hands from one faction to the other. You will start off as a weak level one but you can grow quickly if you put a little time into it. Another great benefit is the walking tour of really cool stuff in your area. You can always check out /r/Ingress. If you're really curious and just can't make up your mind, then install the game and make an agent name, then log onto www.ingress.com/intel. You can use the map to see any portal in the world and also watch your area over a few days to get a feel for how active.

moto360,3dbm8t,street9009,5,Wed Jul 15 00:32:07 2015 UTC,I'd recommend best buy if you can with the 2 year warranty. If anything happens you bring it back and get another brand new and just pay to renew the warranty which is prorated.
moto360,3dbm8t,WalterMelons,2,Wed Jul 15 03:25:40 2015 UTC,That's the best idea I've heard. Only difference in price is for the 2 year protection. I went with that. Hoping to have it this evening. Thanks!
moto360,3dbm8t,WalterMelons,2,Wed Jul 15 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"Nice, yeah I used the warranty once already and paid $4 to renew it. No dealing with Motorola or refurbished devices."

You should still have the same Motorola warranty unless the listing explicitly states otherwise. Recently bought an unlocked GS6 from Amazon. No warranty on the international models. It arrived and I notice that the back button is ghost pressing itself every once in a while. Contacted Amazon and they asked me how much a fix would cost. I said 400 bucks.

I got mine for 70 second hand and cannot express how pleased I am with it for the price. If you really want Gen2, get a cheap gen 1 now and just wait for Gen2 to come out and for an update or two to hit to give it some polish. Basically anything with an OS has that cycle.

moto360,3dbzju,Astra_Starr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"5.1.1. Unplug at 11am, wear it to about 12am before it dies. So that's 12+ hours.   I was also in the same boat about the G Watch R and the Moto 360. I ultimately decided to go for the 360. It's way more classy looking and with my Cognac band, it fits any style. I get complimented all the time wearing it. Plus, the best part, it was only $150.  I love the fact I can use any Qi charging pad to charge it. It only takes an hour (longer with the stock charger) and it's 100% from 0. Edit* With the G Watch R, apparently users with 5.1.1 can get almost 2 full days of usage. So if battery life is what you want, then you couldn't go wrong with that watch.   The screen is a little larger on the 360, but it's a little more clear on the G Watch R. I do wish the 360 had an OLED screen, but with the stock settings, I can easily get through a day. (tilt to wake on, ambient mode off, etc.)   But, it's all entirely up to you.  My local Best Buy had the Moto 360 on display if you'd like to play around with it before you buy it.  Unfortunately, the demo units are locked on 5.0.2."
moto360,3dbzju,Swaginator_v2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:47:40 2015 UTC,Mine comes off the charger around 8am and goes back on around midnight with 40% left typically.  I've only had it about a month but battery life has been like this since day one for me.

moto360,3d90v4,IamSchmoo,6,Tue Jul 14 13:15:07 2015 UTC,"It almost looks like Play Music is syncing new tracks over to your watch via bluetooth.  Do you have Play Music set to sync music over to the watch on some set interval?  The reason I say this is it looks like both Play Music and bluetooth are using an abnormally high amount of battery.    I don't use this functionality of the watch, so I don't know much about it other than it's possible to have a playlist sync over to the watch and be stored there for playback via bluetooth headphones (even without being connected to your phone).

moto360,3d7mmq,tmbridge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:10:20 2015 UTC,I got my moto 360 3 days ago.  How does one check if it's defective?  Or would I know by now after three days of use?
moto360,3d7mmq,maximumhamburgers,3,Wed Jul 15 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"You'll probably know, however it took some research to confirm my specific defect.  There's a feature where you place your palm over the face of the device to put it in sleep mode/ambient mode (it depends on whether or not you have that option on or off in settings)... mine was triggering without putting my palm over the device. It makes a little buzz on the vibrator and then the device enters sleep mode.   Another thing to check is the back and make sure it isn't cracked... other than that you should be golden as those are the two biggest issues I've seen."
moto360,3d7mmq,tmbridge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:54 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  Thanks for the reply.  I think I'm in the clear -- I just get nervous about things like this because I have a track record of getting faulty hardware (although it may be a case of strong negativity bias).   The only negative things I'm experiencing is a bit of lag switching screens immediately after ""wake"" if it's been ""asleep"" for some time. And sometimes my touches don't seem to register until I touch a few times or slightly slide the screen around a bit (without switching screens) and then try touching again.  From what I've read though, both of those issues seem to be common and just an issue with the specs of the watch (needs more ram/processor) and is just part of the deal with a 1stgen device like these."
moto360,3d7mmq,maximumhamburgers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"If you're still in the beginnings of using the device then it could be doing background processes/caching various items like contact photos and whatnot... my device had the lagginess like that the first day or two and then it went away. Also you can make sure you're on the newest software in Settings>About/Info>Software Update, that should solve a lot of the issues including any lagginess and battery length.  The battery will drain pretty fast during the first couple days as well since it's processing and caching a lot of files."

moto360,3d66ff,tmbridge,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"Any idea why this happens?  Based on my, albeit basic, understanding of how wireless charging functions, I cannot see how an un-clean backside of the wire and/or charger would have any effect.  Even if the watch was caked in a layer of dirt and grime, if it's within range of the magnetic field of the charger, it should charge just the same regardless of cleanliness.  I suspect that the variability in maximum charge amount is random and it's a mixture of placebo effect and coincidence that makes it seems like cleaning the watch/charger matters."

AW was working great, voice transcription was fast and accurate.  Then when I switched to my backup POS LG L90, my watch wouldn't be able to translate diddly.  When I switched to a 2014 X, all was well again."
moto360,3cx83q,erikiksaz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:29:35 2015 UTC,Maybe just has to do with the syncing or something. I hardly have any apps on my Nexus compared to the Note as well so maybe that has something to do with it.

moto360,3cx83q,G3yost,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"I see. Is there a point of diminishing returns? Meaning, would I notice a difference on my watch with say, the Note 5 (assuming it steps up performance as you would expect the next generation of Note to) or would my Nexus be about as good as you could get on the phone end to see a performance boost on the watch? I use the Note 5 as an example because it is my understanding that the Nexus 6 and S6 are pretty similar, performance wise, although I haven't looked too far into it other than what I read on /r/Android regarding the S6"

moto360,3ctjvw,aftertaste_,6,Sat Jul 11 07:15:53 2015 UTC,I do. The screen still lights up when receiving a notification. What I and many others want is screen off with vibrate only.
moto360,3ctjvw,theflamingpi,8,Sat Jul 11 07:36:05 2015 UTC,Indeed. The watch is just utterly useless in Theater Mode if I don't even notice when I'm receiving notifications.

moto360,3cwdq2,Reno_Skyy,2,Sat Jul 11 14:59:08 2015 UTC,Could also just as well be a faulty unit not completely sealed. I would definitely go for a refund / replacement. If he lives in Europe and the watch isn't older than six months he will definitely get a replacement from the seller.
moto360,3cwdq2,gregofcanada84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:34:58 2015 UTC,This cant be righr because i let the stream from the faucet hit my watch directly all the time and nothing has ever happened

moto360,3cx4ng,Tanixification,2,Sat Jul 11 18:24:53 2015 UTC,Is this happening with stock watchfaces too? If not then the problem is with the watchface/app you are using.

Especially when trying to do voice commands and the device thinks I'm sleeping it, cancelling my command. This happens enough to be a pretty big irritation, I've only seen one suggested fix which involved getting into developer settings and turning on 'show touches', but that doesn't really have anything to do with the ambient sensor (Which I believe is what is causing this issue).  I'm trying to secure a replacement, moto support has been pretty awful so far and i keep getting transferred and told that they need to elevate it and whatnot. I sent an email to moto forums support and we'll see if that does any better, I've heard a few success stories from people getting replacements through that channel."

There you can tell it what you're interested in and what you're not. Click the three dots in the upper right corner above a particular card to disable it or modify it.  What you can't do is disable cards on the watch without also disabling them on the phone. You can control what shows up, but not where."

I tried to contact support but they told me they couldn't find my device in the system through the serial number. They then told me I would have to send my device in for an RMA to get the spacers replaced... which I thought was ridiculous. I've been meaning to have another go at support to just mail me two bits of plastic but have been too lazy. Maybe /u/Moto_Wendy_W can chime in?

moto360,3cotwi,SprMn1,4,Thu Jul 9 16:07:34 2015 UTC,A custom watch face normally only causes a slight drain compared to a stock one. Some are worse than others. By what you've mentioned though if it was a watch face then it had to be a bug that is causing the issue.

moto360,3crut5,EpicFlyingBulbz,9,Fri Jul 10 07:09:59 2015 UTC,Give it a few weeks and you'll start getting at least a day of battery. I can get almost 2 out of mine
moto360,3crut5,Bipolarbear_au,3,Fri Jul 10 08:05:31 2015 UTC,"Where's the battery indicator? Sorry, I've not actually seen one of these in the wild >.<"
moto360,3crut5,JerkingItWithJesus,2,Fri Jul 10 13:06:06 2015 UTC,In the Android Wear app installed on your phone. Settings -> Battery.   A similar thing exists for your phone's battery in it's settings. It's very helpful!

moto360,3crut5,b1ackcat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"The watch does a lot of chatting with your phone to transmit its sensor readings and learn about you based on data on your phone. I'm only speculating, but I imagine the first few days are somewhat of a ""breaking in"" period where there's more than the usual amount of chatter, resulting in more power usage.  I agree with everyone here so far; it gets way better. I was annoyed for the first couple days too, but now I can go almost a day and a half with no charge."
moto360,3crut5,Drewsipher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"Charge to 100%, drain to 0. Drain it so far that it will not even begin to turn on. Let it charge to 100%. I did that second day and the battery hasn't been a problem since."

Trust me, once the battery settles it gets much better. I'm not a super heavy user but I do get a crap ton of work related texts throughout the day and I do respond to a few of them via voice. Other than that I just use it for quick glances. If you get the right kind of watch face you can view time, weather, battery stats and date with a quick glance which would prevent you from keeping the screen on for prolonged periods of time. Worth noting I DON'T have WiFi enabled since there is no WiFi at my workplace for security reasons."

moto360,3cn0ni,RockItGuyDC,-1,Thu Jul 9 11:08:45 2015 UTC,"This has got to be a bad design practice. I'm a Moto 360 user and a friend of mine has an Apple Watch. All he has to do to turn it off is hold the button down for a few seconds and a ""Turn Off"" prompt appears. Hopefully Google/Motorola add this in."
moto360,3cn0ni,Morgester,3,Thu Jul 9 11:29:55 2015 UTC,I don't understand why.... in what situation would you ever want to power it off? I've had mine since launch and never once had the need or desire to turn it off.
moto360,3cn0ni,DatSnicklefritz,2,Thu Jul 9 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"I don't wear mine every day. When I get home I like to take it off and having it vibrate every time I get a notification can get annoying. Also if I don't have a charger handy, I can turn it off overnight and carry on using it the next day."
moto360,3cn0ni,Morgester,2,Thu Jul 9 12:28:30 2015 UTC,I think... once: when I was staying away from my charger and wanted to save some juice for the morning.  That's it.  It's not a common use case.
moto360,3cn0ni,andygates2323,0,Thu Jul 9 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Extreme case, but in a mugging (or an illegal search, for the am-I-being-detained set) - I've got mine set up with a lock pattern, and it's my smart lock device for my phone. If some dude steals (whether by force of state or not)  both of those, I want him to be unable to unlock either one. The fastest way to ensure he can't do that it to power the watch down before handing it over. If I had enough time to scroll around in the watch, I could just as easily turn it all off and avoid it."
moto360,3cn0ni,twoscoopsofpig,0,Thu Jul 9 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"Do you wear it at night or let it sit in the charging cradle?  If it isn't on my wrist, like when I'm sleeping I turn it off.  And to prevent over charging, I put it on the charger before my day, and take it off when it reaches 100.  If it isn't on your wrist, or you aren't using it, why have it on?"
moto360,3cn0ni,chucklestheclwn,2,Thu Jul 9 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"Overcharging isn't a thing. There are plenty of circuits inside the watch that are there specifically to prevent overcharging.  It will reduce the life of the battery exactly the same if you let it sit on the charger at 100%, or if you turn it off when it's at 100%."
moto360,3cn0ni,Klathmon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:33:21 2015 UTC,Can you prove that?  All I've ever heard it letting anything stay on a charger past full charge is bad
moto360,3cn0ni,chucklestheclwn,3,Thu Jul 9 13:36:08 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to find proof, but I remember Motorola saying this as well. If you notice, sometimes you'll leave it on the charger for a long time and when you remove it, its at 97%. This is because once it reaches 100% it stops charging it completely until it goes down to 95% in idle mode, then it tops it off again. Don't worry about overcharging it."
moto360,3cn0ni,DatSnicklefritz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:42:09 2015 UTC,"I guess Motorola did say that, I guess I was wrong."
moto360,3cn0ni,chucklestheclwn,3,Thu Jul 9 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"I actually worked for a company that did a bunch of battery stuff.  I don't have any easy-to-understand stuff, but basically lithium ion and most lithium polymer batteries (the ones in your smart-devices), degrade due to extreme temperatures and charge/discharge cycles.  Basically a full cycle is going from 100% to 0% to 100%. Batteries are rated in these cycles, so for example most modern batteries made in the last 5 years or so have around an 18% reduction in battery life after 1000 cycles. So your battery will act like it can only charge to 82% after 1000 cycles (but it will still show 100%).  Now, the amount of degradation that occurs looks like an upside down lopsided bell curve. Letting your battery be near 0 is the worst for it, and charging it near 0 is the worst, around 70% provides the least amount of degradation, and around 100% is slightly more.  Now most devices don't actually charge to 100%. Because that reduces battery's longterm life, they generally stop at around 95% (but will show that as 100%). Then once they are there they do one of 2 different things:   They switch over to ""plug power"" pretty much bypassing the battery completely. This is the best way that it can work, but it's also more expensive so it tends to be used less. They do a slow ""trickle charge"" into the battery, and let it drain a bit, then trickle charge more. This is VERY easy on the battery's lifespan. Because it's generally only about 1% up/down every 6 hours or so, so leaving the device on a charger like this for 100 hours acts like 1/100th of a charge cycle (basically nothing).   There is also a TON of circuitry inside the device to handle charging. This is because lithium based batteries will EXPLODE if they actually over/under charge (yeah, if they run TOO low they will blow up). This tech has been very refined and works very well, and with all due respect, it knows better than you.  So just let your stuff charge, and stop worrying about it. It may degrade the life of your phone, but the total amount over the devices lifetime will probably be equivalent to about a single 100%-0%-100% charge cycle (basically nothing).  If you really want to save your battery, keep it within temperature range. Don't let it get colder than 0F, and don't let it get hotter than 104F. That will do MUCH more for the life of your battery than worrying about charging ever will."
moto360,3cn0ni,Klathmon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"You clearly have facts, I just have urban legends lol.  I turn mine off so my phone vibrates beside me when I sleep.  I sleep in a king alone, so my phone sits beside me on the other pillow"

Are you saying that, if possible, I should throw my watch of the charger when ever it gets around 70% (and even sooner if possible?)?  Are you saying that the lower I let the battery get, the more degradation the battery will experience during that charge back up?  I've read a few recommendations to 'calibrate' the battery the first few times by letting to drain to 0% and then charging back up to 100%.  IIUC, this is calibrating the software that tracks the battery and not actually the battery itself -- but what are your thoughts on that recommendation ('calibration' by which I mean letting it drain to 0% and then back up to 100% a few times at the start of the battery's life.)"

Yes, but don't worry about it that much. Your battery will outlast the ""normal"" life of the watch for most people.   I've read a few recommendations to 'calibrate' the battery the first few times by letting to drain to 0% and then charging back up to 100%.   Battery calibration is a complete myth. Back in the early days of android (2.2 and 2.3) android used to wipe battery life information when it was rebooted, so restarting the phone would somewhat ""calibrate"" the battery readings.  Ever since then it does nothing.  Now the reason this seems like it works is because right after an update you tend to use the device more, and it has to do more stuff like setting up after the first boot. So when you let it run to 0 you have to let it ""do it's thing"" for a while, and once you recharge it it's back to ""normal""."

moto360,3cn0ni,DatSnicklefritz,2,Thu Jul 9 12:17:06 2015 UTC,Well the thing only takes about an hour to charge and I'd rather not keep it on the dock all night while I sleep once it's finished charging. If it finishes before I fall asleep I'd like to just take it off the dock and turn it off.
moto360,3cn0ni,DatSnicklefritz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"It has overcharge protection built in, it doesn't continually charge it past 100% if you leave it there all night, just saying. Don't create extra work for yourself for nothing."

moto360,3ci3lv,farmerbb,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:37 2015 UTC,Okay I tried restarting it but not for a while.

moto360,3ci3lv,Colobravo,2,Thu Jul 9 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"Allright so here is what I would do.  These are options not directions don't get it confused lol  -Power off > power on -Factory reset  -Put the watch in the bootloader setting. (to see if it is something wrong with the hardware or to see if it is something with the software)  -let the battery run out and recharge.   If it is something with the software (meaning if in the bootloader it dosent look blurry) contact Motorola customer support and I'm sure they will exchange it.   If it is something hardware this ""MAY"" have been caused by you damaging the watch. honestly I don't know how this might happen but you never know.   if you got it at bestbuy and bought the warranty just go get another one."
moto360,3ci3lv,DelusionalX1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:32:30 2015 UTC,Maybe check the bootloader before doing a factory reset?

moto360,3ck5bm,ThrowYFNaway,5,Wed Jul 8 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"It is a muted slight ""gold"", more of a champagne. It doesn't look fake at all, but it doesn't have the shine of real gold either. It is nice, but in darkness almost looks in between gold and steel. In my opinion."
moto360,3ck5bm,Astra_Starr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:34 2015 UTC,How close would you compare it to the iPhone champagne gold
moto360,3ck5bm,Astra_Starr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"Don't have one of those handy but it's similar to the mophie juice pack gold only that is brushed matte. The moto is slightly shinier, but not too glossy."
moto360,3ck5bm,Astra_Starr,3,Wed Jul 8 23:32:14 2015 UTC,I sold my silver when the gold was announced and have not regretted it. It definitely isn't a true gold but is more muted. I get a lot of compliments on it from other women thinking initially that it's a Michael Kors watch.
moto360,3ck5bm,asifms,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:07 2015 UTC,Oh GOD...lol plz tell me the watch doesn't look feminite in real life.

moto360,3cge2c,IveRedditAllNight,5,Tue Jul 7 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Same happened with me. Just got my Moto 360 a few days ago and battery drain was unreal. After tons of resets and and uninstalls, I finally found a solution that helped a lot.   Downgrading to Android Wear apk released on May 27th from http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/android-wear/  I did that, uninstalled all Wear Apps and performed a factory reset on the Moto 360. Things have been okay so far. Took off the charger at 9:15am and its now 6pm on the dot. I'm on 20% life left."
moto360,3cge2c,idefiler6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:54 2015 UTC,I'll try that for sure if it keeps up.

May I ask how you set which apps are ""allowed"" to be installed on the watch while keeping them on your phone?  I've found that any app I've installed on my phone automatically makes its way to the watch, as long as it has a Wear implementation.  I'm a newbie to the Moto 360 so I'm still learning how to optimize use.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!"
moto360,3cge2c,Shatteringblue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:08:36 2015 UTC,With a moto 360? There is no possible way you are even using that if it last more than 15 hours.

moto360,3cge2c,krispicyweiner,2,Wed Jul 8 03:27:41 2015 UTC,Battery sucks bad today. Fully charged it again. now it says it only has 3 hours left since 6. So 4 hours on a full charge. Yesterday I got like 27 hours. Don't know what's up. Nothing has changed.
moto360,3cge2c,devinrs42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:36:47 2015 UTC,My battery shits all over itself every now and then. It isn't regular but has happened at 3 to 4 times. Same as your battery. By lunch my watch is dead and I barely used the fucker. Sometimes I reset the watch other times I don't. Usually after a good recharge this problem goes away.

moto360,3cih66,TubularTorqueTitties,2,Wed Jul 8 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, same here.  I've just been staring at the order complete screen.   I've heard once it does go into transit, that it's two-day shipping.   But what really grinds my gears is that I just went to Best Buy yesterday and seen the exact same watch I customized on MotoMaker. I could've already had it and paid less tax😑  Edit, can you inform me of when they do ship yours out? Mine is stuck on July 6 on the Order Complete screen. I've waited two business days so far and would just like a rough estimate of when I might get mine. Since they've waited 4 days on you, plus the 2 day shipping. That's 6 days of waiting. I'm still 4 days behind you right now... 😑😑.  And the funny thing is, they had my order completed and watch built all within the same day!"
moto360,3cih66,Swaginator_v2,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'll let you know man! I'm starting to think that the whole tracking thing is just bullshit, and has nothing to do with the watch's actual status."
moto360,3cih66,Swaginator_v2,2,Wed Jul 8 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"Hey. So I just got an email saying my order has been shipped. It included a tracking number from Fed Ex. Estimated delivery date is Monday morning. I'm hoping it comes a bit sooner (other people have been saying it has 2 day shipping, once the thing finally ships). This is a bit frustrating though, as I could've ordered one from Amazon and had it by last Saturday.   I'll keep you updated on when it finally arrives. It is shipping from Shenzhen, China to the East Coast (my home) in the US, for reference."
moto360,3cih66,Kushybear,2,Thu Jul 9 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, dang. That is frustrating. I guess I'm in the same boat as you. I'm a day behind in my order. I live in the East Coast as well.    That's crazy it's coming from China. I should've just Amazon'd it like you said.  Two day shipping, less tax, and shipped from a warehouse within the country.  Lol."
moto360,3cih66,Swaginator_v2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha. The reason I didn't go with Amazon is because I wanted a silver case with a black leather band. Amazon had black case with black band, or silver case with the grey band. I couldn't really afford the extra money for another band currently, so my only option seemed to be going through the Moto Maker lol. Oh well, now I know if I want a 2nd gen 360 to Amazon that haha."

moto360,3cih66,GeneralOsik,2,Thu Jul 9 02:37:22 2015 UTC,I had the same situation and ended up going into chat 2 days ago (Wednesday) to figure out what was up.  They claimed the watch was backordered because of how many orders there were and that there would be a delay in shipping.  It ended up shipping out very late that night(day?) from Shenzhen with an estimated delivery of Monday.  Arrived this morning though :D  West coast USA.

moto360,3cgdob,felipelessa,5,Tue Jul 7 19:13:36 2015 UTC,They also have to protect their image as a company. If they created an option for it then it would mean that they endorse it as a feature. Do you know how many reviews would pop up about the battery being dead after only 2 hours?
