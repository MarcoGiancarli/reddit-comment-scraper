Labour appears paralysed by the Toriesâ€™ portrayal of them as the party of welfare, allowing the SNP to noisily assume the anti-austerity mantle. The government, evidently conscious of the narrowness of its majority, is unlikely to countenance losing a vote so early in its term. But it is hard to dismiss purely as party spin the SNPâ€™s claim that it has already been responsible for four Tory climbdowns: on human rights, the date of the EU referendum, Evel and now foxhunting.   That's 4 climbdowns and 2 votes against the Tories were Labour have abstained (last night's on Welfare and tonight's on the Budget)."

Their Chairman resigned this week before he was pushed. If they can't or are unwilling to keep House in check, then the SG have to step in.   Part of the problem is that the SPA is a quango run by liberal handwringers, politicians and agenda driven muppets who have no clue about policing, far TOO MUCH influence and an air of self importance that is on an incalculable scale.  Police Scotland is not a business and it is not a process driven organisation. It should be about people, the public and the people it employs.  Sadly though, the louder minority who vocally express their dislike of authority have the ear of the moderate majority and most people now have an automatic distrust of the police. In other words, Police Scotland will only ever be as good as it's last fuckup, irrespective of how many people receive great service, how many murderers and paedophiles are locked up, how many needless road deaths are saved by positive intervention and how many other unquantifiable differences are made to people's lives.  This negative public opinion combined with chronic issues around staff and officer numbers in critical areas of the business, weak robotic first line leadership in the name of accountability, bloated middle management preoccupied with targets, figures and organisational restructure, and sheer utter apathy from the top is making for a poor work environment. Add on hugely excessive workloads, having to work doubly hard to cover for those who have gone sick and the whole thing is seriously affecting people's mental and physical health.  Over and above all, cuts to the policing budget are a factor in nearly every decision made and every consequence of those decisions.  How about we stop paying private solicitors thousands of pounds in legal aid to take on minor criminal cases.  If prosecutions can be handled by a public body, why not defence?  Half the Â£160m legal aid budget would pay for 4,000 police staff.  We spend the guts of Â£12 BILLION on health care in Scotland. Surely Â£140m, the annual saving needed, can come from that or other areas where there is high waste and little return."

Not the the stuff that could be cut rather than stuff that won't be cut and hence the department won't actually be cut at all.   By asking for 40%, he's saying posture all you want but you're going to have to find real cuts - if you cut all the politically unacceptable stuff only, you'll look stupid. The departments are going to have to come up with politically acceptable cuts.   The politically acceptable, like changing business class for economy or budget travel, would not normally have been forced through (or exceptions made) but now they will. This is a root and branch look at the departments, and hopefully will kill off the empire building that happens in most bureaucracy"

Since the 56 reached Westminster they have engaged in centrally organized, intentional campaign to obfuscate Westminster procedure and willfully mislead the electorate and people have barely batted an eyelid.  I grant Murray's wording is clumsy and he definitely should have avoided saying 'voted against' but to me at least this seems an attempt to try and clearly identify his/labours disagreement with parts of the bill.

Scotland,3e23m9,istillfeelyou,12,Tue Jul 21 11:44:30 2015 UTC,Another referendum in the next 5 years would be the death knell for the independence movement. I would doubt most people want to go through another independence eferendum any time soon. I'd also be willing to wager there would have been a fair number of people caught up in 'referendum fever' whom this time around might not even bother voting.   If they do another referendum they need to make sure they win it.
Scotland,3e23m9,GallusM,0,Tue Jul 21 11:44:29 2015 UTC,"Would need to be 10-15 years minimum really. In fact, the longer that passes until the next referendum, the more the chance of a ""Yes"" victory increases I feel. If you look at the demographics, (not being unkind to any older people here) the overwhelming majority of 65+ people voted ""No"".   Now, if you consider in 15 years, many of those older people... won't be around, and also consider the majority of younger voters (<25 year olds) voted ""Yes"" then the demographic changes quite dramatically.  Honestly it depends on what happens in the next few years. But ideally I don't want another referendum until 2025-2030 at least."
Scotland,3e23m9,MakeshiftLeftBack,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken if you think it's a generational thing. It's not. It's a life thing.   A 16 year old has fuck all invested in society. For them, shaking it up means nothing. The risk (next to none) is worth the reward.   As people age they collect their stake in society. They buy a house, they get a job, they start a family. The more and more of a part they play in society the less willing they are to rock the boat and potentially fuck it all up.   And if you think 65 year olds in 15 years time won't be worrying about the security of their state pensions, I think you're setting yourself up for disappointment..   If you want this independence thing to happen, relying on people dying simply won't work. You'll need to make a better case for independence."
Scotland,3e23m9,Frankeh,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"You have to factor that in though. A lot of the older generation voted ""No"" purely because they still remember the war, UK defending itself from Germany, the War Effort attitude etc. and you'd be very naive to think that this wasn't the case with at least some of the older generation. I know it's the view my Grandfather held."

We can't just turn this into a 'neverendum' where the issue is constantly on the table. It's not feasible. Give it a decade, or as a result of a major change in the UK (like exiting the EU). I think it's only right that the will of the majority is respected for some measure of time, giving us a chance for some stability."

Scotland got what they voted for 56 SNP, 1 Labour, 1 Tory and 1 Lib Dem. If Scotland were an independent nation those 3 non SNP constituencies could rightly claim to have a government they didn't vote for by the same reasoning, but that ignores the fact that the government is made up of the opposition as well and it's impossible for every group to get the government they voted for."

Scotland,3e23m9,SeyStone,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"My problem with these statements is the finality of them. Scotland did not speak decisively, we are only just barely still part of the UK. They need to accept that at least 45% of us want significant change, writing us off as 'wrong' or 'losers' or 'bitter' only serves to infuriate."
Scotland,3e23m9,the_hunchback,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's a smart move; they're only asking but any answer can be construed as the beginning of a commitment. And what can the government do? Refuse while they're openly seeking independent voting for england? Or accept, alienating a huge swathe of english voters? Damned if they do, damned if they don't."
Scotland,3e23m9,lux_roth_chop,0,Tue Jul 21 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"Such a question can be quickly closed down with 'The UK government will of course respond to any reasonable request made by devolved institutions.  The UK government, at this point, doesn't see it as reasonable to expect the Scottish people to engage in yet another 2 year campaign for independence'."

Scotland,3e23m9,lux_roth_chop,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:39 2015 UTC,"It's not the ""UK government's"" place to dictate what the Scottish people want or don't want.   That's why they asked Scotland and Scotland said in no uncertain terms that it wants to be British."
Scotland,3e23m9,kbox,0,Tue Jul 21 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"The UK government is elected by the people of the UK to have a view on what's in the best interests of the people of the UK.  People in Scotland voted to remain part of the UK.  Scotland's people are UK people and share the risks/rewards/common decision making.  I'm sure the UK government would respond to overwhelming demand for another referendum, especially if it had a true triggering event - some major change - e.g. the UK leaving the EU.  But there is certainly an argument for saying no to another independence referendum in in 2018.  The most I can imagine is for the tories to engage with the SNP and put into place some official triggering methods - (i.e. Europe) as well as a commitment for some kind of regular 're-affirmation' of the union - i.e. it being possible for any part of the UK to hold a separation referendum, should they choose to exercise the right, once every 10/20 years.  Or perhaps a referendum being triggered if x number of signatures can be gathered from each constituency, above a triggering level.  This would seem reasonable to me; and wouldn't create constant uncertainty.  It may well be that a future scottish government, that isn't the SNP, choose to push this out, or add further conditions.  Alternatively the SNP could go radical and actually demand federalism."
Scotland,3e23m9,wappingite,-8,Tue Jul 21 11:35:12 2015 UTC,"The UK government is elected by the people of the UK   First mistake: no, the ""uk government"" was not elected by the people of Scotland, and that's who were talking about here.   Scotland's people are UK people and share the risks/rewards/common decision making.   Second mistake: again, it is not your place or westminster's to dictate what the people of Scotland want and especially how they should identify themselves.  And biggest mistake of all: if this is an honest issue to be honestly decided, why is it every discussion is dominated by you believing you can tell us what we should want, who we should be and what we should do? That's not how equal partners in a shared union behave."
Scotland,3e23m9,lux_roth_chop,4,Tue Jul 21 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"First mistake: no, the ""uk government"" was not elected by the people of Scotland, and that's who were talking about here.   Yes it was, they voted in an election that lead to the tories winning a majority; and accepted the rules of the election and the probably outcomes.  Large parts of England, by your measure, didn't elect the UK government (by your definition of electing).  We all agree to the rules of the election and participate in it.  Our votes contribute to the outcome of who shall lead the country.  By your logic, if Scotland had achieved independence as a result of the the referendum, would you say 'separation was not requested by the people of Scotland' ?  It's certainly the place of the UK government to respond to the democratic mandate of the Uk electorate.  In the same way as it's the place of the Holyrood government to respond to their own mandate.  Or do you view the SNP passing a law that someone who voted labour or tory might not agree with as 'dictating what the people of scotland want'  The biggest mistake you make is to assume that someone disagreeing with you is 'being dictated to'.  Also the union is equal in the sense that each person is equal to each other.  One person, one vote.   The UK does not have a federal system.  Someone living in Scotland does not have more say just because they live in a nation that has a lower population.  Someone's vote in wales is not worth more than someones vote in England.  If that were the case then we wouldn't be living in an equal society.  Do you think a voter in Scotland should have more say on UK affairs then a voter in England?"
