Dogtraining,3e4k6n,itsonlyliz,4,Tue Jul 21 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I have a German Shepherd and I am not comfortable with him playing with small dogs the way I let him play with dogs that are 60-80 lbs. My dog likes to wrestle and (very gently) mouth and it is just too easy for a smaller animal to get hurt.  I am uncomfortable with my dog even chasing very small 10-20 lb animals, but you'll have to use your own judgement. I just think it is a little easier for my dog if he thinks he can never chase anything that small, but dogs are smart and you could probably just give him the go-ahead with individual dogs or the 'leave-it' if it isn't okay.  Also I like to supervise my dog when he is playing with other dogs just in case. Weird things can happen like a dog falls on the other and hurts it and then a real fight happens or a dog gets a leg stuck in the other dog's collar (taking collars off prevents this)."
Dogtraining,3e4k6n,spidermilk666,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:38 2015 UTC,"The play is supposed to be watched. I work 7 hours a day and hate leaving my pup crated for that long. My friends daughter (13) is supposed to watch the dogs. She said she didn't notice the cut and didn't hear any crying. So we're not entirely sure if my dog was the culprit.  Leave it is Lestrade's worst command. She selectively follows it.  I can lay food and toys out all day long and tell her leave it. She also left the dog alone every time I told her to today. But most of the time if she gets a scent or sees something (especially other dogs) she goes into a little trance and just stares at it. Sometimes, if it's a dog, she'll bark in a ""hey! Come play!"" Kind of way.   She's doing training right now (advanced) but it apparently doesn't  cover leave it"
Dogtraining,3e4k6n,GSpess,2,Wed Jul 22 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"I don't usually let my 65b dog play with anything less than 45 lbs. Anything under that, IMO, is too fragile for him, and something as innocent as wrestling can go wrong with little to no effort. He is actually very good with smaller dogs, but he has a bad tendency to flop, drop, trip and lean into things.  He loves to play wrestle and mouth dogs, and while he's fine doing this with larger dogs, smaller dogs are at a much higher risk for serious even fatal injury. He can play as rough as he likes with my 56lb foster, since they both can take a beating (when they get tired my smaller foster rolls on his back and uses my bigger dog as a punching bag), but if the dog is too small it's a no go.   I rather my dog be upset at the fact that he can't play than end up having another dog injured (even if no harm or foul was involved). Better safe than sorry, you know? It's all part of owning a larger, powerful dog breed.   The only very odd exception I have is he has this very strange enjoyment of being chased by Chihuahuas. It's seriously hilarious."
Dogtraining,3e4k6n,Allikat4101,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'd hate to ban her from playing with small dogs only because most of my friends have smaller dogs. I'm the only one with a large breed. She's known all these dogs since she was 8weeks old.   The reason I've never stopped her from doing it before is she's very submissive. With dogs significantly smaller than her she'll just lay on the ground and let the smaller dog wrestle on top of her.   I'll have to consider dropping the banhammer on her play with little dogs. Usually I'm supervising her play and she rarely gets out of hand (over excited with big dogs), this time she was under the care of my friend's 13 year old daughter.   Even if I can stop her from playing with little dogs, she goes to my friend's place with her pugs Monday - Thursday. I don't know if the teen will abide by the ""keep them apart rule."" She's good with using my pups commands, though, which is why I was hoping there would be a way to train ""gentle"" or something."
Dogtraining,3e4k6n,g33ksh3ik,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:23 2015 UTC,We have a 50lb lab mutt and it is possible to get the larger dog to play gently with smaller dogs but it takes a lot of work and hands on training.  By the end of puppy class our pup self handicapped playing with a Chihuahua puppy.   When we started class he practically rolled the chi into the ground in his exuberance.  It takes a lot of socialization with dogs (our guy plays with the great pyranese next door) as well as play dates with other pups from class.  When the pups got too exuberant parents stepped in and separated and calmed them down.  This is hard if not all dog parents are on board.  We still watch him very carefully with small dogs but we also know he can play with dogs smaller than him.
Dogtraining,3e4hov,toxicityj,4,Tue Jul 21 22:00:34 2015 UTC,The bells are a tough concept and not every dog is going to get that part. It is your job to make sure you are consistently taking the  dog out and training with the bells. It is never ending.  Small dogs are also known to be difficult to house train. Just have patience.
Dogtraining,3e4hov,BIOdire,5,Tue Jul 21 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"and since we just moved into this house this past weekend   Here's your problem. Not only do dogs not generalize well, but they also don't take to change immediately. He knows not to poop in your last home, but doesn't know the rules of your new house. You need to take a step back and start his training over again. Good news is, he should pick up on it very quickly."
Dogtraining,3e4hov,LucidDreamer18,4,Tue Jul 21 23:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, new house = starting over on potty training. I know, I've moved TWICE this month! Yes, that is crazy, I know. BUT we haven't had issues because I planned ahead and went back to a confined area/ kennel and systematic potty breaks with rewards for the first two days. She established her potty area quickly and hasn't had more than two accidents.   As far as the bells... every time you take her out bop her nose or hit the bells with her paws. She will quickly re-associate the bells with the outdoors."
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,idiotjenn,3,Tue Jul 21 22:35:55 2015 UTC,How much exercise and mental stimulation is he getting every day?
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,LucidDreamer18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"Usually our walks are around 30-120 mins depending and we go to the dog park every weekend. I mean honestly, sometimes he doesn't get a walk because life just happens. I do feel like most problems are caused by lack of exercise but the past time this happened my boyfriend had already taken him on a decent walk earlier in the day so this was his second time around! Maybe he's still not getting enough? Or maybe there needs to be more mental stim?"
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,LucidDreamer18,5,Tue Jul 21 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"GSDs are bred to WORK. A few walks, though decent in length, won't cut it. He needs a job and/or he needs to be running."
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,00z28,2,Wed Jul 22 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"The common thought process is usually a long moderately paced walk is the most appropriate exercise for a dog. Most of the time it's true but ever since I got my doberman I've found that I could walk him for 3 hours and he would come home still full of energy. Some dogs just need a whole lot more physical exertion to wear them down.  I have found that the best and most appropriate mental and physical exercise for him is obedience work and using games of fetch, playing tug, or just general wrestling around and rough housing with him a bit as a reward. It's honestly the only way to wear him out every day."
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,myladywizardqueen,2,Wed Jul 22 01:23:04 2015 UTC,I will tell you that my GSD has issues with excessive barking unless she gets at least 3 walks a day. All dogs are different
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,myladywizardqueen,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"All dogs are different, but my GSD needs at least 3 walks a day (morning, after work, before bed) or she barks excessively, jumps, etc. It's a lot of responsibility owning a working dog, but if you don't take precautions, your pup might get worse. (Speaking from unfortunate experience)"
Dogtraining,3e4mk7,malfera,3,Tue Jul 21 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Most likely frustration and an attempt to solicit play, although without seeing it that's just my best hypothesis. Your response is probably confusing him a bit on that front - whether it's simply enough attention to satisfy him, or the punishment is enough to take down his interest in play is a guess without seeing things in person.  How much exercise does your dog get daily? How much time do you spend playing with your dog daily? How do you play with your dog?"
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,Qu1nlan,6,Tue Jul 21 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Instead of waiting for her to tell you she needs to go outside, take her out every 3 hours like clockwork, and give treats when she potties successfully outside. Try to cue a potty word so eventually you can get her to do her business on command.  You really shouldn't be keeping her in the crate that much. She wants to be with you! There's nothing wrong with letting her roam the house as long as a pair of eyes are on her at all times to watch for signs that she needs to go out. Watch for circling, sniffing the ground, and kind of an awkward walk. You can even leash her to your belt to keep her near you if you want."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,caffeinatedlackey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, every 3 hours is also her food/water schedule (water every 3, food every 6), do you think I should just take her out immediately after that?"
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,caffeinatedlackey,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"Puppies usually need to potty immediately after any of the following: eating, playing or roughhousing, and napping.  Just a question, do you also feed her in the middle of the night? I'm curious how feeding a dog four times a day would work."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,caffeinatedlackey,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"No, we don't feed her at night. The schedule is 8-2-8, and  8-11-2-5-8 for water."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,caffeinatedlackey,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:57 2015 UTC,I've never heard of a schedule for water before. I just have water out all the time for my boy to drink whenever he wants. He's pretty good at self-regulating.
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,badlcuk,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"We had a professional trainer tell us to do that because she said puppies walk by the bowl and end up sipping regularly making it harder to enforce a pee schedule, but if there's better advice to the contrary I'm certainly open."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,Estranged180,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that's a valid strategy, it just wasn't necessary for us. My pup is a weirdo who has to be convinced to eat and drink sometimes. Even when we come in from a long walk in the summer heat, I have to take him over to the water and splash it around a bit before he will drink."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,bunny_face,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"That is a really weird strategy...if you're around to monitor the dog, you should be able to monitor the water intake and approximate when your dog needs to go (particularly when it drinks more then usual, and whatnot). Ive heard of removing water at night, and i guess i get what the trainer was getting at, but its still surprising.   I definitely agree with trying umbilical training and taking the dog out more regularly. While the dog could likely easily hold it, if you're available, id take the dog out every hour or two to play outside supervised--so that you can catch (and treat) elimination. Id even start teaching commands for elimination to try to ease things in. That way the dog spends more time outside the crate, outside in general (more time for you to catch elimination and reward), and tethering to catch potential indoor accidents."
Dogtraining,3e3cvk,abycatgrl,5,Wed Jul 22 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with the setting of a schedule here. I'm also going to suggest that instead of feeding her 3 times a day, that she's old enough to be fed twice a day. This will also help regulate digestion, which will come to make potty training a bit easier on you.  Umbilical training has come up as well, and instead of putting her in the crate when she's not outside is a great idea. Find yourself a leash that you can tie to you, no longer than 4 feet when it's tied up to you, and use that to help keep an eye on her. This is going to eventually create the 'velcro dog' effect. Where you go, the dog goes.  You want your crate to be a happy place. If she has any issues going into the crate at specific times, like for sleep times, start crate training over again, and leave out the potty training. While for some dogs, it's far easier to potty train and crate train a dog, for others, it's an exercise in stress. Sometimes (like I did for my own dog) crate training and potty training were exclusive training sequences. If she doesn't like the crate as a result of potty training, start over with the crate training.  Finally, it seems you've encountered the flaw with bell training. The suggestion here is watch her body language when she rings the bell to go potty (you'll know when that one happens) as opposed to her body language when she just wants to go outside to play. The difference may be incredibly subtle, or outrageously exaggerated. But there will be a difference."
Dogtraining,3e4v7w,myladywizardqueen,2,Tue Jul 21 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible! I just adopted a second dog after having my first for over a year. My first dog, Luna (2yo maltese-pomeranian), is very very attached to me and can be territorial when she feels as though I'm not loving on her enough. This new puppy, Tonks (1yo shepherd mix), also has ideas about who needs to be pet when/where.   When adopting my new puppy, I was able to take her for a ""trial adoption"" and we introduced the two puppies in neutral territory to start. Luna did snap a few times but with some reinforcement from me, they handled it very well. Once you introduce them in a neutral territory, then I'd consider bringing the new dog to your home. Is there a large space where they could be introduced? (A fenced in yard would be ideal here, I think) Reintroduce them on leashes. It may take some time and you may have to have them leashed until you can trust your GSD, but I believe it's very possible.   Best of luck!"

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,LucidDreamer18,4,Mon Jul 20 18:03:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, and what is the best way of teaching that without the clicker? I've tried doing it now, but when I tell him to come he just sits/lays there because I've told him so. EDIT: another problem is that he is really random. He does all his tricks when I have a treat for him, but if I don't have one he'll only do it when he feels like it."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Kolfinna,6,Mon Jul 20 18:15:36 2015 UTC,The clicker isn't the problem. Something you're doing isn't rewarding enough to him.  Check out Zak George or Victoria Stilwell on YouTube.
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Kolfinna,3,Mon Jul 20 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with luring,  using the treat as bait.  The dog should never see the treat until after they have offered a behavior."

He loves his walks. However, he will only come if it's VERY obvious I have something he wants, and even then he doesn't always come and it takes quite a bit of convincing. He's very independent, and looking back I realize I set myself up for a lot of work getting such an independent, smart dog as my first pet."

Very, very smart puppy who doesn't, unlike our 2yo Aussie, need to be within 5 meters of us at all times. Knew what ""come"" meant at 9 weeks, and we are just now feeling like his recall is solid.    Always treat, every time (hotdogs for us) Always praise and pet, every time Added a whistle before yelling ""come,"" seems to do a good job of getting his attention Always super excited, ""Higgsy come!,"" even when we don't feel excited Practice in different places: inside, backyard, at the park, at my parents' house, hiking, etc. ""Safe Word"" for emergencies (it's ""Puppy Party"" for us); an impossible to ignore, super silly/happy phrase that you can't say with an angry tone and reserve for dangerous situations (headed towards the road, the giant mastiff who eats puppies for lunch, the skunk hanging around the bins, etc.)   Those are the things that have worked for us."

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,BigMickPlympton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:29 2015 UTC,"If you are feeding him dry food, get a treat pouch and feed him while recalling him during the walks. The trick is to do it for at least a week, so it can be established as a habit. It's ok if he's not that into it on the first day or two - their own dog food is not a super exciting treat for them and they still hope there will be food at home later. As soon as he understands the game, he'll be at your side as soon as you look at him. It worked wonders for us."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,fixed_gear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"My dog's recall is great, but she does not 'stay'. I have a distinctive whistle that she will respond to, but asking her to sit still is a challenge because she is so easily distracted. So I can call her, and she'll come and then get distracted almost immediately and then I'll call her again and she'll come right back. Sometimes I call her and she comes on her way and then remembers the exciting thing she was doing before and then will turn around and I'll call again, repeat ad nausea.  I think this may be complicated by the amount of freedom and independence she is allowed to have when I'm not around. I have a big back yard, and the back door to the house has a door closer that pushes the door closed, but doesn't close it completely so the dogs can open it and let themselves in and out as they please. So she kinda does what she wants, and when she wants some attention she comes and finds me and I give it to her."

I rescued my first dog two years ago (at 4mos old), and he was dog aggressive and afraid of everything.  He was literally afraid of shadows! The best advice I got was from our first trainer was that I had to ""believe"" in myself and my dog.    Tonight we just finished a 16 obstacle agility course in class, with no verbal cues, and 5 other dogs watching.  And he can do weave poles.  18 mos ago, the things we are doing seemed like magic.    I promise you, that once you find what motivates your dog - you can train him to do anything! :-)  Edit: recall, and a rock solid 'sit-stay'."

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,CrazyD0gLady,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"Sit, Stay, Down, go to a pedestal, come are probably our dogs' most used tricks. My wife likes to take pictures of them on things. But these are also fundamental to learning harder tricks.  We also use a paws up command for having dogs pose while leaning on things.   Some tricks you can teach are touch your hand, sit pretty (chipmunk position), stand, walk at a heel, and close the door.   Others are more game oriented, which make them fun for you and your dog. A simple one is playing catch or having a dog retrieve a ball. You can play shell games or hide and seek.  Kyra Sundance has some books on dog tricks and how to teach them.  Your dog is small enough to skateboard."

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,CrazyD0gLady,5,Mon Jul 20 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"I agree recall. I'd add, ""wait"" and ""drop it"" as well. ""Stay"" is good, but my JRT is trained to stop whatever he is doing, immediately, and not move to ""wait"".

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,5,Mon Jul 20 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"We use wait as a variant of ""stay,"" and train in a similar way. When the dog is moving, tell him to ""wait,"" and then praise/treat when he stands still or stops what he's doing. If he moves, lure him back to where you said ""wait"" and repeat. Only reward when he does what you asked. We use it as a ""temporary"" stay: the dogs know that they'll get what they want soon, makes it easier for them to stop dead.   Once he gets the ""stop moving"" part, use it in other situations (chewing, eating, whatever)."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Angry_Caveman_Lawyer,3,Mon Jul 20 20:16:31 2015 UTC,That seems a really good thing to teach
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Scarecrow30,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"I do the same with ""wait."" My dogs know it's a means to an end.

Same deal at the front door, eating, going inside etc.   The release essentially equals the reward for them I think."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,CrazyD0gLady,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:08 2015 UTC,Exactly. Big ones for us are waiting at door to go outside and waiting in truck before jumping out at the park. We literally started using it as a way to keep the beasties from beating us to a pulp when a door opened.
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,d03boy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:35 2015 UTC,"With my JRT I started out really small, with treats. If you get ""sit"" down well, or ""lay"",  tell them to ""wait"" and take a step back. Click and treat if they stay. Take another step, repeat. When they start to follow you stop, make them sit or lay again, and begin once more. It takes patience. With food items, I lay down something they want, and put my hand over it while telling them to ""wait"". When I see them calm down or look away from it, I remove my hand and say ""okay"" and let them have it. Again, taking longer and longer each time. ""Drop it"" is easier when using treats. Give them something they like, like a toy. Then offer them something better, while telling them to ""Drop it"". When they drop the toy (or whatever) click and treat immediately. Eventually they catch on. Some breeds are more stubborn than others or individual dogs may take longer than others, but eventually they all get it. I suggest watching videos by Dr. Sophia Yin. She's an expert at this type of training method! She's amazing."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,CrazyD0gLady,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"Our puppy learned the trick of ""waiting"" very quickly, since we first introduced the idea when giving him his meals. I would be on the floor with him with the bowl in my other hand. At first we would reward him by giving him the bowl when he stopped staring at it. Then we rewarded him with the bowl when he looked at us. Then we would put the bowl in front of him, say a firm NO if he got closer to it, and finally I taught him to start eating when I nodded, did a hand sign and said ""there you go"". It took probably two weeks for him to understand that, and now it just comes naturally that he would wait before eating a treat.   After that it was pretty easy to teach him the ""wait"" command, since he had already understood that sometimes he had to be still to get a reward, eg. a treasure hunt. At first I had to correct him multiple times, but now he's a big boy and understands the command very well."

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Augumenti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:16 2015 UTC,"It's very important to socialize your dog to both other dogs, and people. There are ways to do that, as well. Also taking them out in public situations is important. My JRT is really big into thinking everything that moves is his to kill. High hunting instinct. So I take him often to the barn around the horses and other animals, on a leash attached to a belt I'm wearing (or just wrapped around me) so he's close to me and can't get far. At first he's excited to be there, and eventually he settles. He used to want to just go straight for the horses and get at them. Now he's not so impressed. He hasn't gotten past the ""on leash"" aspect, but it's slowly sinking in - and he's 13 years old - but he's not lunging and barking and trying to eat them any longer. It takes patience, positive reinforcement, and perseverance, but it can be done.   Edit: I got this dog when he was 8 from a rescue, and he'd never had any training nor been on a leash."
Dogtraining,3dyw4u,JIVEprinting,2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe a doorway? Use a leash and a door.

I stole it from my grandmother, who was 5', always in the kitchen, and had a 100lb lab who loved to be around her. To avoid tripping over him all the time, she taught him that when she said ""baking position,"" he would go into the corner of the kitchen, lie down, and stay there until released.  I taught it to my parents' dog (who is so underfoot that my mom has broken her ankle by falling over her), and am working on teaching it to my hound.

I've got a pair of miniature dachshunds who learned pretty quickly where the food comes from and I've stepped back on them a few times. If you stay very consistent with your training, the pup will pick up what you're trying to teach them. For example, I have a bed in the lounge and when I was teaching I would just repeatedly say ""out of the kitchen"" and take them to their bed. Important to reinforce it with treats so they know exactly what you want. Also make sure that every single time they come in while you're cooking means they get taken out. No matter how much food gets burnt or how frustrating it is, you just have to turn around and attend to the pup."

Dogtraining,3dyw4u,Scarecrow30,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Here's a handy one:I worked at a vet clinic and the best command is ""hold still"". This way, your dog knows not to jump around in case a vet has to give a vaccination or draw blood, both are common veterinary practices that your dog is likely to experience. Also comes in handy if you need to brush your dog, examine him, trim his nails, or put his leash on. It's actually very easy to teach to a small dog, like your pug."
Dogtraining,3e0wf0,zinnadean,7,Tue Jul 21 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"So, can you clarify a bit please?  When did you use the prong collar? Was it while taking him out to all these different places? How often did you use corrections and were you taught how to properly use a prong collar? Did he start getting worse while using the prong collar or after stopping?   What do you do during the lessons? What were the environments you trained him in?  Usually for dogs that are becoming very reactive three or four sessions really isn't enough. You said that he started out just being nervous around vehicles and bikes and then moved on to being reactive to people and dogs showing his reactivity isn't really at a minor issue anymore. It's moved onto something that may take quite a bit of work to solve. Some people spend months and months training and working on reactivity. It's not a quick thing. Fear is a hard thing to combat and it takes a lot of patience and work to do so. I personally spent 8 konths working counter conditioning almost daily to get my dog to stop barking at noises outside.  It sounds to me like you might over stimulating him during the sessions which is causing him to listen less. You want to start as small as possible in an environment or a distance away from whatever you're counter conditioning where your dog is comfortable and slowly introduce them to it. Slowly build positive interactions and work your way up to being closer and closer without putting the dog in a situation where they feel threatened because they're not going to be able to learn well when terrified.  Say your dog is leash reactive to other people. You take them to a park and sit far on the edge away from people. Every time your dog looks at a person you click and treat. Stay at roughly this distance for a few sessions then move closer. Continue to do this as slowly as your dog needs in order to feel comfortable. If your dog starts to show any signs of anxiety you've moved too close too fast and need to move back. The goal is to slowly work your way up to where you can have the dog within a few foot of another person without them caring.  That's how you should handle everything he's reactive to.  Work on one or two things at a time and work your way up to being able to have him in different environments. Don't take him out in to public constantly before you finish or at least make decent progress in this training though. You don't want to accidentally upset him and set your training back.  Also try using positive reinforcement to introduce the harness. This video is technically for muzzle training but the same method can be applied to get him to like a harness."
Dogtraining,3e0wf0,WOOFCheCazzo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:30:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, I was trained to use it by a trainer that stopped showing up.   We always did our training at a park. It was a walking park so there were bicycles, dogs and people. We had some issues but minor. Then we'd walk through it to a small town and go in and out of stores and my favorite coffee shop. He'd lay on the floor while I'd order. I'd have treats as well.   His reactivity became worse as I phased out the prong collar for a front clip. I have used two positive reinforcement trainers and understand how it works. I know these things take time. It took along time to get him to lay down in the stores while I talk to people."

His methods have been thoroughly debunked and you will do more harm than good trying to pinch your dog's neck or assert dominance. This will only teach your dog to associate you with fear and pain, and will exacerbate the bad behaviours.  Please read our sidebar for lots of resources on positive reinforcement training.  For you, what you should be doing is praising & treating good behaviours. In this case, that means you should lavish all the praise and cuddles when your pup is behaving himself in the ice cream shop. Redirect his attention to you when he gets too excited/barky, and praise/treat when he settles."

Dogtraining,3dxt67,stabracadabra,25,Mon Jul 20 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"First, I think you need to evaluate your feelings. Don't rush this, but really take time to decide if this is something you can handle. There is no shame in admitting something is beyond your abilities to control or deal with. If you believe you cannot handle a dog with aggression issues, then you need to become comfortable with the idea of re-homing.  that isn't to say that is the only option or the first one. If you think you won't be able to handle the aggression, give it a try. Talk to a couple trainers and find one who fits. Be prepared that you cannot push this boundary again. Even if she become manageable with other dogs coming in, even if you have good control and she is well-adjusted, you should not risk it again.  If you absolutely cannot get a trainer for some reason, then research research research. Post in positive training dog groups, read up everything you can, start with muzzle training (I believe every dog should have this for the 'what if's that tend to pop-up in life. ) because a muzzle can save a life if for some reason there is another situation like this in the future."
Dogtraining,3dxt67,ginpanda,11,Mon Jul 20 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"My dog bit a puppy very badly and now he doesn't go out without a muzzle and leash. He doesn't care a bit about the muzzle, and because of that conditioning, he lives a happy life. This could be your dog too!  That being said, I will dissent in that I think it's wildly irresponsible to rehome a dog with such a past. Everyone who wasn't there for the bite told me ""don't worry about it, he just doesn't like puppies, no need to muzzle him."" Well if they were to have him, they wouldn't muzzle him and how would I feel if he did it again? The reality is that some dogs can't be trusted in certain situations and passing this problem off doesn't mean the dog will be going somewhere that it is dealt with responsibly or effectively."

I know that's different than what you're going through, but I also felt like this was a different dog, and it took me a long while to trust him and look at him the same way.  I don't think that you need to put her down. I think if you're interested, you could try to rebuild your relationship with her and keep her, but probably never allow her near other dogs. If it's too hard for you, then rehoming might be a good option. Try not to make any emotional decisions right now, take a few days to regroup if you can. :)"

Dogtraining,3dxt67,handjobbanana,5,Mon Jul 20 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"I work with dogs, and unfortunately what you went through is a normal behavior for a lot of dogs, not just Pitts. I've seen sweet Goldens do the same. I don't mean normal as in common, but that it does happen and your dog needs to be watched around small children and dogs, especially puppies. I would not recommend fostering again.  I don't know exactly what started the sudden attack--it could have been an over correction possibly--but one thing puppies do well is scream. And once a dog screams, the prey drive kicks in and can have deadly consequences. I suspect that's what drove your dog over the edge. Ever see a dog destroy a squeaky toy the more it squeaks? Same thing. It's not malice and not a failure on your part.  I'm sorry for what happened, and please try not to blame yourself. If you have further concerns, you might want to consider carrying a commercial animal repellent spray for off-leash emergencies. Test it with a toy first to get a feel for how it works.

Since I don't know your dog and her behavior, I can't offer much advice. Just know that this is a normal behavior for dogs and she's not suddenly some blood-thirsty killer. She may just need to be kept separate from any strange dogs. Plenty of people keep pits (and other breeds) who aren't great with other dogs no problem, so I don't think it's worth putting her down over. Having a qualified professional (check the sidebar) come in to evaluate her would likely be helpful too.  Edit: by ""normal"" I don't necessarily mean ""common"" or not worth seeking help to resolve.

Dogtraining,3dxt67,emgoog4,9,Mon Jul 20 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"You absolutely do not need to put her down for this. There are hundreds of dogs living perfectly happy lives who have killed/injured/shown aggression towards other dogs. Sometimes they can be taught to get over it, sometimes not. Just because a dog doesn't like other dogs does not mean they are vicious and need to be put down.  I would never foster again, if you keep her. This is not only for the safety of the other dogs, but for her well-being as well. It's not 'fun' for dogs to be aggressive towards other dogs. I'm pretty damned sure she was not 'enjoying herself' when this happened. She was pushed, she saw signals you didn't or she gave signals you didn't see and the puppies didn't read, and she felt she had no other choice. This is, most of the time, what causes dog-on-dog aggression. One or both dogs feel like they have to act aggressively... and it's not a 'fun' thing. It's stressful.  Adding more foster dogs will not only put them at risk, but your current pit too. She'll have to endure the stress of new dogs every time you bring them in. It will mean keeping her locked up away from any new dogs you bring in--which isn't fair to her or new pups.  But putting her down is not the solution you should go for. Give yourself time to calm down, and see how you feel once your emotions aren't running so strong. If this has torn your bond with this dog, that's ok. It's perfectly all right. This was traumatic for everyone involved and if it's too much, that's perfectly acceptable.   Look into finding her a new home if this is the case. Make sure you are absolutely one hundred percent open about this incident. There are plenty of people who only want one dog, who could give a dog-aggressive dog a 100% awesome home.   If you feel like you can still have a bond with this dog, find a trainer as some people have recommended. Personally, with the fact that this incident lead to death, I would not attempt to try and 'get her used to' other dogs. Honestly I would look for a trainer to help ease your mind that this was situational, and that this dog isn't going to go nuts on you, your family, your other dog. Just put yourself back at ease with your girl.  Also, something I haven't seen many people bring up, know that you aren't alone! I have a very good friend who had a very like situation. Her two year old GSD was getting ready to pass her CGC class, when a puppy was brought into the training area to begin basic manners. Her GSD killed the puppy when it got too close. This dog had never shown any aggression before, was seriously just days away from passing her CGC, and was one of the sweetest and most trustworthy dogs I've ever met.  Dogs have millions of signals going at any given time; some of them we can see with the naked eye, sometimes we have to record and watch interactions in slow motion to see them. There are just times when dogs don't connect with each other. It's awful and heart-breaking but it DOES happen!  Good dogs can sometimes do horrible things, but that doesn't make them bad dogs and it doesn't make you a bad owner.  Take some time to calm down. Maybe put your girl someplace safe in the house where you might not have to deal with her directly for a little while. Decide what you think would be best for you, and for her... but please, do not put her down over this."
Dogtraining,3dxt67,batmanthegroomer,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"Rehoming a dog with this issue is incredibly irresponsible and frankly, a horrific option.    The dog has just shown that it has an incredible (and violent) prey drive that sets off in a moment.  Whether the dog needs to be put down or not I don't know...but what I do know is rehoming it would be a horrible option.  At minimum, this is a dog that should not be left alone with children or other animals and should be muzzled when outside on walks.  It should adapt fine to these restrictions and--assuming no other issues--should be able to live a happy life."
Dogtraining,3dxt67,tracygee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"There are specific groups who deal with re-homing dogs of this exactly nature. The dog was just being a dog, put in a situation unknowingly where she acted in the only way she felt she could. She is not a vicious animal. She is not a murderer. She's not out for blood. Putting her down is an inhumane and human reaction.  Re-homing her PROPERLY is a completely viable option. This kind of trauma can break the bond between a human and their dog, and between a dog and their human. Trying to force yourself to keep a dog after that happens will only be bad. Trust issues could arise and then you've set this dog up for even more failure. You'll have days where you can't look at the dog without recalling the traumatic event, which means days where the dog gets little-to-no stimulation... which increases the chances that this could happen again, or something very similar.   Going through a group who has experience re-homing dogs like this WORKS. Based upon ONLY the evidence given in this post I'd say your statement is incorrect. Based ONLY on the post. I'm sure there are instances where you are correct. Perhaps a dog who is fearful of humans who has been put in this situation--then you're trying to find a home for a dog who has human trust issues, who's been put in a bad situation, and it's whole world is turning up-side-down. That could be bad, yes.  Telling someone in this position that re-homing the dog is a horrific option is a terrible thing to do. This woman is in a highly emotional state having just seen something traumatic. You cannot expect everyone to be able to recover from this the way you would. She may never feel the same way about this dog again. A post like yours tells her she must either get over it, or kill the dog. NEITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE GOOD FOR ANYONE."

Keep in mind that this is based on a survey that was passed around, not a hard study. That being said, some conclusion can begin to be drawn from it.   If you are truly interested in discussing the topic further, I can grab some resources from the vet hospital I work at as well as discuss it with some of the CPDT's and Behaviorists I work with."

Aggression in pitts seems to segregate with ~normal levels of stranger aggression, slightly low levels of owner aggression, and high levels of dog directed aggression. This makes sense in terms of breed history.   I'm a geneticist and I'm moving into canine genetics in September/October. Assuming those resources are directed at lay people, behaviorists, or vets they're not really relevant for me."
Dogtraining,3dxt67,Surf_Science,0,Tue Jul 21 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'll have to get the credentials from work to log in and give it a look. Much like the study I linked however, this study appears to also be based on data gathered from surveys given to owners. These are not behaviorists, geneticists, or vets, these are laypeople without accreditation or schooling filling out a survey. As such I am hesitant to rely heavily on it to draw such a broad conclusion at Pits are inherently aggressive.   What really strikes me as odd is your closing remark. You really mean to tell me that peer reviewed studies published in professional journals of medicine and behavior are of no use or interest to you because they are not specifically targeted towards geneticists? It strikes me as odd that you would say that when we are quite literally having a discussion about the overlaps between behavior and genetics and how one influences the other. And yet you link to a study from the journal ""Applied Animal Behavior Science""?"
Dogtraining,3dxt67,wake_the_dead,2,Tue Jul 21 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"If its a peer reviewed journal articles its fine, the primary audience of those isn't actually vets/lay people/ behaviourists. Much of the information developed for non- scientists, pamphlets, summaries etc is unsuitable  for hypothesis building. Because of the whole economics of canine breeding and ownership things are really operating as though its 1980.    It strikes me as odd that you would say that when we are quite literally having a discussion about the overlaps between behavior and genetics and how one influences the other.    Right, but information that is of the quality I need should basically be incomprehensible to non-specialists, that the way academic literature works.   I hadn't mentioned that I was an academic and so for all I knew you were going to suggest some cheesy BS that would not be useful for me.   Sorry if thats harsh, I've been up for 36 hours"
Dogtraining,3dxt67,Surf_Science,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:10 2015 UTC,"Please explain this to me: if the target audience of academic veterinary and behavioral journals (such as Applied Animal Behavior Science which you linked to) is not professionals and academics in those fields, who then makes up the target audience? Who do you think are submitting studies to these journals?  Further, your proposed notion that information of the quality you require should basically be incomprehensible to non-specialists is downright absurd and entirely arrogant. For one, I am far from a specialist and yet here we are discussing a peer reviewed and published study that you linked. I would argue that the very purpose of any peer review journal is to provide a means by which people in various academic and scientific fields can publish information in a manner which can be digested by many. This is not to say that they are intended for perusal by the average lay-person, academic journals are far from light afternoon reading. But you most certainly have not attained some higher level of intelligence allowing you to perceive information far beyond the grasp of the literal millions of people who read these journals.   I'm gonna really cut the shit here and say this: the notion that academic or scientific literature of any quality is only understood by high level academics or scientists is bullshit. It does a great disservice to the community by perpetuating the idea that the people gathering and studying this information are a bunch of smarty-pants white coat wearing motherfuckers looking down on the poor uneducated masses. It's that very notion that you put forth that is downright patronizing and has the startling potential to stifle the interest of someone who may be interested in pursuing the sciences and deter them from further inquiry. I feel comfortable in saying that we both appear to be men (or women as it may be) of science, and as such, I'll assume you are in agreement when I say that I believe one of the more broad goals of scientific study is to provide all who are interested with a wealth of knowledge and to share information freely so as to foster critical thinking and understanding, as well as potentially encourage new minds to join the ranks. To ague that scientific information of value is only understandable to a select club of specialists goes against one of the main tenets of scientific and academic study."

But I accept the fact that they are prone to dog-aggression. It's normal. Hounds are going to howl, labs are going to love snow, terriers are going to have high prey drive (which is a very common problem among pits, since they are terriers, and that can make them bad with much smaller dogs), and pits and several other breeds have a chance of being dog aggressive. It's not horrible and doesn't make them bad dogs. It just has to be something that the owner is prepared for and willing to work around."

You will never live with yourself if this dog hurts a child or another dog.     I don't know why people feel that a muzzle will prevent this dog from repeating this.   You cannot muzzle a dog 24x7x365.   This dog will be exposed to a child or other dog and likely react the same way.    I have a pitbull mix whom I trust with my children's lives.

There is such a negative connotation attached to dogs with dog aggression, but there shouldn't be.   As long as the owner of the dog-aggressive dog takes caution, they can have a perfectly happy, well-adjusted dog and great family member. Your dog doesn't have to like other dogs to be a good dog. You can still walk your dog. You can still play with your dog. You can still trust your dog with people.   Dog-on-dog aggression has no link to dog-on-people aggression. Sure, some dogs can be both... but not all of them. Some dogs will bite any human that comes near them, but would never attack another dog... and vice versa."
Dogtraining,3dxt67,batmanthegroomer,4,Mon Jul 20 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't even that hard to manage a dog with dog aggression. You just train good obedience so you can call it away from other dogs if you run across them while walking, put a muzzle on if you're headed to an area with a lot of loose or poorly controlled dogs, and don't let people bring dogs to your home and stay away from dog parks. Having done both, I'd take a dog with true aggression over a fearful dog anyway because IME actual dog aggression is a lot easier to control and manage."

He's allergic to beef and chicken, same symptoms as your poor baby. My dog can't handle wheat or corn for even ONE meal. I'm lucky in that we have a neighborhood organic pet food store that sells First Mate and other organic brands, along with prepared raw food meals that really only run me $2 a day on average. I will tell you that switching to a raw food diet helped my dog. He also gets fermented fish stock poured over his meals that really helps keep his digestive track flowing like he was a young buck again (he's 13).   Look into food allergies.

If so, you can order a lot of really great brands of limited ingredient or grain free foods there.  I don't know if Chewy.com ships international (I'm assuming you're in Vietnam) but they're a good choice, too.  As for brands, Blue Buffalo is questionable in ethics lately but they're pretty widely accessible.   You may want to consider using a proxy shipper if you can't order from Amazon in your area.  Tons of people in the USA will be happy to have something shipped to them, then turn around and ship it back to you for whatever the international rate is.

Dogtraining,3dxswb,trobo84,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while I was skeptical of Hill's W/D, my dog has only had diarrhea once in the past year, and that was after he got into something; even when he does get into something (eating a pound of raw almonds and some pistachios with shells), he doesn't get diarrhea.   I know some vendors ship Hills Prescription. Or you can take a look at the ingredients and maybe try to replicate that or find a similar food."
Dogtraining,3dxswb,danaofdoom,4,Mon Jul 20 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"A post I can relate to!   Our dog has a really sensitive stomach it seems where any type of treat or food can upset it easily. No parasites or anything either since we got him checked out a bunch.   I'm going to assume since you've been to vet a number of times that you've tried bland diet (rice, boiled chicken, cottage cheese, etc). We had good success with that but as we tried to transition him back to his food it kept coming back. So we switched up his food, removed any of the weird treats besides boiled chicken chunks, and it's been a lot better.   We've recently given him some canned pumpkin mixed in with his new food if he has a flare up of diarrhea. It seems to help.   I think the situation you described is probably somewhat stress related for your dog. I know our dog poops more in new places he's not used to yet.   I would recommend switching up your dogs food. The food you have is probably good but may just not be a good fit for your dog. It's just trial and error really.   Keep at it! I know it's frustrating, but the little crap machine is worth it."

Dogtraining,3dxswb,mtil,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:24 2015 UTC,I'd consider looking up healthy bone in raw food diets for dogs. You'd work with your local butcher rather than your local pet food supply. It is worth considering.   www.rawmeatybones.com is a decent place to start.
