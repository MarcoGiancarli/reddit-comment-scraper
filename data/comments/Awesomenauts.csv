Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,photoperitus,10,Tue Jul 21 01:42:47 2015 UTC,That's awesomenauts!  ...  :|
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,NiceYogurt,19,Tue Jul 21 05:13:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, rocco's arrow hitbox really just seems off - a possible solution would be to adjust it to err on the side of the hitbox being smaller than the arrow - would make it more of a skillshot that way too. Right now that thing is easier to hit than Scoop's hammer."
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,TheMesp,18,Tue Jul 21 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"I'll have you know I trained for months to hit people with that hammer consistently. It's the hardest skill ceiling to reach in the game. I think I should be rewarded with an appropriate prize just for playing such a tough naut, like a lifetime supply of ice-cream. Ronimo please buff Scoop, trash tier, too hard to play, hammer should come back like Thor's and hit people on the way back too."
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:08 2015 UTC,Scoops hammer is certainly not the hardest skill ceiling in the game.

Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,doubledanksauce,4,Wed Jul 22 01:05:50 2015 UTC,Arrow hitbox seems almost like scoop's hammer..
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,shallllal,0,Tue Jul 21 07:58:58 2015 UTC,It makes more difference at high speeds.  For some reason people can never figure this out.
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,poongoolie2,4,Tue Jul 21 02:03:42 2015 UTC,What do you mean exactly? What makes more difference at high speeds?
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,Keebsy,7,Tue Jul 21 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's pointing out the following fact: the amount of ground covered by Penny when falling at high speed (as in the video) combined with the distance traveled by the arrow during that time, can be quite high.  With even a ping of 150, that cumulative distance can make a big difference.  That said, it's clear what you were pointing out, and of course it doesn't seem very fair."
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,suntiosimo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"People usually know how it works. They are just mad because this is a thing in awesomenauts, because game is very reflex based and full of skillshots."
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,Kngrichard,-4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:40 2015 UTC,"150 ping in slow motion. Yes his hotbox is just wide, but the shot was not that far off when you play it at normal speed."
Awesomenauts,3e0pqd,bird_eggs,2,Tue Jul 21 09:26:43 2015 UTC,How far the shot is off has nothing to do with the speed it is being played back at.

Awesomenauts,3e03mr,Springinsfeld,13,Mon Jul 20 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Been feeling this a lot lately too. I've been playing for years, at first as a time-passer with a buddy, but then over time I started to play regularly. Now, with 1100+ hours played, I can honestly say the community is getting stagnant. You play the same people over and over. If they've got a full premade and you don't, prepare to be stomped for the next few games. If you do, prepare for boring, routine wins with the same old team compositions, because let's face it, no one wants to lose rank in a premade.   Deign to play global? Prepare for the brazilians or russians who spam taunt as they run away with 5% health over and over, (or worse, their paper cup and string internet connection wins the day!).  I was thinking about adding a line re: global chat, but I don't think -anyone- would be surprised at what I had to say there.  To be honest, I doubt I'll stop playing completely, at least not in the immediate future. Having said that, if I found something new or interesting to keep me busy in my free time, I DEFINITELY wouldn't lose sleep over a lack of awesomenauts either."
Awesomenauts,3e03mr,moldycheerios,5,Mon Jul 20 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"I feel kind of the same way honestly. I've been around since season 1. I used to look forward to playing nauts, even if it was just to pass the time, but now I'd rather not play. Before you say,""Oh just take a break,"" I have many times and was going to use my season history from awesomestats, but it appears to be down right now. Balance has been a problem for a long time, and it feels pretty stagnant right now. I'll probably wait and see for balance changes."
Awesomenauts,3e03mr,cpudude30k,9,Tue Jul 21 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"Hm... I don't feel that way.  I was here since season 2, and right now I'm in love with it. It may be because I'm winning a lot.  I'm League 2, so it's not like I'm one of those pro-guys who win tournaments and such.  The game changes a lot. New features, that you have to adapt to, with both new nauts, new droid/turret logic, and so on. To me, it's just adapt, adapt, adapt.  I haven't seen the ""noob"" and ""rekt"" for a while either, but I have seen them before, and YEP! Those are definitely annoying. It's hard, but stop caring about it. If they write that in the end after the defeat, just leave the game. You're not committed to answering them or just writing something.  A good tip is, if you feel you're getting heated up, your energy is drained or other stuff like that, take a break. Like 30 minutes, or something. I usually do 2 games in a row and then I take a break, doing something else, because I actually sweat when I play awesomenauts. The temperature in my room raises drastically...  And then of course the usual tips:   Stay with your team Keep and eye on your team and enemies on the minimap Don't take too many risks Don't die. Really, even if you're trying to defend. Don't go all in and die. Remember to kill the droids. If you kill a lot, you'll end up with a great solar advantage   It's ok to take a break from Awesomenauts. I hope to see you back though :)  It IS a fun game."
Awesomenauts,3e03mr,FlawlessHappiness,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"For some it's fun, for many(in my experience) it's not. I've talked to so many people in all chat and personal friends, saying they only play the game because they have friends that play it, a lot of people just don't enjoy the game. And they have real reasons why"

Awesomenauts,3e03mr,TheGoldenFruit,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:07 2015 UTC,"I was going to respond very similar to this. Just ignore the bad apples. And if I find myself getting frustrated I take a break for awhile. I play for fun and don't want t to ruin the game for me by trying to take it to seriously and feeding the trolls. That is important to remember, they are just trolls, most of the time if they are not being fed they go elsewhere."
Awesomenauts,3e03mr,Gnardar,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"I also had the same problem, and I found out the answer to it about two months ago.   It's pretty simple, get a group of friends (or friendly randoms from global chat) and just play custom matches. You can have fun with all the settings it provides and it's not serious at all, you can actually have fun with the game you're playing. (If you want to have more fun, check out flawless' game modes.)  At this point in the past month I've played more custom matches then I have played ranked matches, and whenever I see a L1 premade trying to fight me in ranked matches, I just try to have fun before they 'rek' us."
Awesomenauts,3e03mr,midebita,2,Tue Jul 21 09:26:11 2015 UTC,"I feel for you.  It's a really frustrating experience when people are jerks.  What's worse is when I try to make light of the situation in chat, only to have people respond in even worse ways.  I often like to experiment and try new things for the fun of it: my whole goal is to have fun, and others can sometimes ruin the relaxation.  (Just a couple days ago, I had two teammates grief me for building a character in a non-meta way, then rage quit.)  Anyway, have you considered some alternative options?  After your break (which is probably a good idea), you should think about some of these ideas.  Try to start a custom game - just for fun - with some relaxed people in general chat.  Say something like, ""Non-toxic game of Randomnauts.  Come join for some chill fun.""  I've seen that before, and I'm assuming it works.  (In any event, can a player be kicked from a custom match after it starts?  Just curious.)  Maybe try to find a couple friends to play with.  No, not in the ""lawl find some friends loser"" kind of way, but in the sense that you can play with people who are not toxic and who don't just hold 1 and march onward toward the enemy base to another feeding death.  I'm no pro, but I (usually) act with general game sense, and I'd be happy to be a non-toxic companion for you some time.  Something I try to remind myself to do (though I often forget) is to immediately mute a player at the first sign of toxicity or jerkiness.  For example, if an enemy taunts in the initial drop pod, I smile, mutter to the computer a ""thank you"" that they revealed themselves to be a jerk so quickly, and instantly proceed to mute that player.  I can't tell you how many times I've done this only to later witness extended heated chat in that very same match - over the very player I muted (I can infer based on the fact that I can't see his/her text, but presume others are often responding to it)."

But I'll tell you friend, I feel exactly the same. It's not only that but also most of the times my matches will go against Russians or Europeans. My ping goes up to 300 and I can't even play. Even when region only is on. However I have never had a problem with other online games, my ping was never so bad. I'm also taking a break. Waiting for these servers to come up. Until then, I'll play something else."

That's when I decided to stop playing awesomenauts , I didnt play it for one month until I decided it was time to go back , and believe me it really worked , I now play less but I have more fun now.  I'm planning on start playing seriously again when I get back from vacations and get to league 1 again (it's actually pretty easy to get to league 1).  So that's my advice take a rest from the bad things and return when ready."

Well first of all when you're gonna be climbing leaderboards you must play with nauts you main , so I recommend you learn to master some nauts before (In my case I main Rae).That's a video I made when I got back to awesomenauts.  As far as I know you climb faster when you soloq , so try doing that (I don't really like playing premade all the time) if you are not winning a lot of games invite someone to help , after you won some games you can continue solo.  Never quit a game ,no matter what , NEVER quit you don't know you might end winning , it doesn't matter if your team quit , please just keep playing.  Take rests , don't play when you don't really want , what I do is play 3 games and rest like an hour or so and the continue playing.  You must keep playing , so try to play each day you can.  These are all tips to climb correctly the leaderboard , but in the end I guess its more about your ability and how good you can be.  Hope I can help , you can ask me more if you want."

After playing the game quite extensively for a while I almost completely quit about half a year ago because most of my matches were not very fun, the community seemed toxic and too many games had leavers.   In the past few weeks I've played the game a few hours but I think I'll never play the game as much as I did before (partially because most of my friends stopped playing as well), and I'll probably only played it casually with some friends every once in a while."

If you are the first person to pick your character select who you want to be but don't confirm. Unselect your character in the last 10 seconds and see who your teammates picked. At that point pick the best character to have a good team comp.   Too many losses from bad team comps.

Awesomenauts will not get a future as long as this things won't change: Matchmaking and Lag Issues, GeoLocation algorithm for the pairings, League matchups (Remember when they removed the leagues from the scoreboard? Coincidence? I think not.), Gold generation and discrepancies, Rejoin System.   Also one thing i don't understand is if Ronimo tried to make a casual game, why promote passive gameplay that much?

Awesomenauts,3e03mr,bananasandpie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"For me, Awesomenauts is addictive but not always fun. I've quit several times too and my longest stretch away from the game was 3 months. They keep us coming back with new characters and new patches, but you can tell from the miserable Steam numbers that they can't keep players around long term. There's just too much bullshit. Everyone knows what the bullshit is. We've documented it a thousand times, but Ronimo isn't going to fix (insert bullshit here).  I feel like the core frustration is that the game is fundamentally unbalanced. It's not the individual nauts that are OP/UP (or flavor of the month) that causes this, but the game mechanics of the matchup itself. Would you be as frustrated if there was a proper pre-match lobby where you could talk to your teammates for 90 seconds to come up with a strategy, make a decent team comp, and see the enemy team's comp as well?  They do it for tournaments, why not ranked play? I usually stick to Randomnauts now, which is still actually fun and you get the bonus of getting to play through the cast and practice at the same time. How seriously salty can you be when you get a brand new naut every drop? :)"

What I didn't like was the fact that the video showed up glitchy while editing, and while I told the program to render in 60 fps, the final product uploaded was in 30.  I'll just stick to fraps for now until the tool is ironed out a bit.  EDIT: Audio as well seems quieter than usual. Also just realized that the video finally processed in 60fps. That took a lot longer than my usual uploads do."

Awesomenauts,3e08bs,youngzelda,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"There are often valid reasons to not go on the offensive.  For example, I prefer late-game builds.  This means I often play carefully for quite a while until my build is rolling along properly.  Other times, it could be that the enemy team consists of better players/brawlers, in which case I might wait until I have a significant advantage before I consider going in.  Overall, I'd say it's preferable to have teammates who won't be offensive to teammates who refuse to defend.  Just my opinion.  I'm sure there were other frustrations at play there, too."
Awesomenauts,3e08bs,Keebsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"At the moment, there's no reason to force fights in nauts. There's no, ""we need to force this fight to regain control of mid so we can have better positioning. It's whichever team is defending is sitting behind their turret in effort to catch a mistake from the pushing team. The stall type of games are so irritating, and I'll even admit; my team stalls when we are down because we want to have the chance of a comeback. At the moment, there's no reward for fighting, only risk. Thus, teams will stall as much as possible, and it's even the case in competitive nauts. Some teams know that stalling and playing extremely passively is still rewarding. I'm on the same page with you."
Awesomenauts,3e08bs,CoinCheck,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"depends on comp; if you're vs something with little counter-initiation, or you have a lot of displacement, it's better to fight.. unfortunately, since scoop + swig + coco are really good and common picks, competitive nauts revolves around jerking off behind your turret if you're behind. Really wish scoop + swig weren't so oppressive. This metagame is ridiculously unfun.."

Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,KEEVAN1234,10,Sat Jul 18 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"Basically this.  I remember people calling for nerfs literally the day he was released.  His range was already nerfed in a hotfix after release.  People need to adjust for a bit.  For what it's worth, I have seen some very poorly played Roccos, so it's certainly not everyone that's great with him.  As for his being in so many matches: it only makes sense.  He's the new toy in the game, and everyone wants to try him out."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,Keebsy,5,Sat Jul 18 05:25:01 2015 UTC,"I do have to admit though, lobbing uncharged arrows with nicotine patches, explosion radius, and max damage feels reeeaaallly dirty."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,KEEVAN1234,5,Sat Jul 18 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"Ive been using this combo with high success. Maybe a damage reduction for uncharged arrows could be added, so other upgrades, like the charge speed upgrade arent over shadowed."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,smoothmochachoca,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, draw and travel speed are useless compared to the other upgrades. constantly lobbing arrows with cooldown item in lane is really good."

Because he's new the vast majority of people don't have the kind of expertise with him the way they do with their usual picks.   I don't think he's too terribly imbalanced, but he could use some slight toning down in a couple choice areas -- namely range and precision shot cooldown/hitbox."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,hurleyb1rd,2,Sat Jul 18 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"It's easier to pick up a new character and do good compared to playing against said character since you will have prior experience on how to deal with the match ups.

Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,ZubbleTheFearless,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, nearly every character has been like this on launch then they tend to receive nerfs shortly after release.

Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,KEEVAN1234,3,Sun Jul 19 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"I wreck Rocco in nearly every game I play against him, you just need to learn how to fight him.

Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,Digimon_Lover,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:44:19 2015 UTC,Can't complain either. His lack of a double jump makes him very predictable.
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,A_rabbit_foot_failed,6,Sat Jul 18 09:54:21 2015 UTC,"Half of the awesomenauts cast only has one jump too, so I'm not seeing how the predictability from one jump can justify that there can't be any complaints."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,YooToohzi,3,Sat Jul 18 10:19:30 2015 UTC,"And basically every naut double or single jump is predictable anyway.  His droid clear is decent. His turret push is almost below average. His poke is good, and he's pretty easily dueled with most nauts (because burst>DPS still D:) so I think people only complain because they aren't used to building vs poke damage or DPS.  Ted is better in almost every way (push, clear, burst, sustain damage, CC), except for poke.  TL;DR Not OP, learn to play against him."

If you pounce at him, vengeance easily slows you down enough so where he can kill you, and prevent you from getting any combo points.  The only option when seeing Rocco as penny is to run away, and hit and run to go get health because he landed his uncharged arrow on you and hit you with 20 AAs."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,ZubbleTheFearless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"I will go back to my original point of 'you need to learn to fight him'. You can't approach him straight on like most 'nauts, you have to be more tactical.  Penny's burst will easily kill Rocco before he can do anything about it, especially with silence on pulse."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,Digimon_Lover,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think his CD on q is ridiculous, if I dodge it someone else gets hit, then I gotta be in a position to dodge in another 3 seconds. At least with coco I know her engage cooldowns leave an opening.   Trying to get at Rocco's engagement opportunities will have you eating the next one with vengeance on, and you might as well be dead at that point."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,Shup,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he will be receiving nerfs or tweaks. His range is still way too much, and his vengeance lasts a bit too long imo."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,CoinCheck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"my only problem with rocco is when they lag horribly and im getting hit by global arrows that i cant even see until they go PAST me and the damage flashes above my head.   i know other ranged characters are annoying too when theres lag, but at least you can stay somewhat AWAY from them for the most point. to have to randomly jump because theres lag arrows headed down the center of the map every 7 seconds is really annoying."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,slickmasterizzy,0,Sat Jul 18 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think people understand how to deal with him. He's like a coco, if you see his long range projectile coming, dodge it. That kind of gets rid of any benefit of nicotine patches. If he starts using his slow ability, don't try to chase him down. The one thing I think they will nerf is his max AA damage, because at the moment he can bust out 284 per shot if no nauts are pressed up against his face."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,HoneyTheYellowBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"It's not 284 though. 45 base + 30 (damage upgrades) = 75, 75% (3rd arrow upgrade) of 75 is 56.25, 50% (out of range = more damge upgrade) more of 56.25 is 84.375, 84.375 is 253.125."

Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,HoneyTheYellowBear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"That's kinda odd. I guess what the game is doing is just nullifying the 25% reduction from the third arrow upgrade and just slapping 25% more damage on top of that, since that would come out to 94. Very weird that it wouldn't just do 50% more damage in relation to the actual damage of the arrows."
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,KEEVAN1234,2,Sun Jul 19 02:37:43 2015 UTC,why do people keep talking about his arrow its his aa and its insane range you cant approach him without taking a shit ton of dmg
Awesomenauts,3dpbhq,blackstarpwr10,0,Sun Jul 19 03:51:21 2015 UTC,284 per shot? what the hell are you talking about? Base arrows is like 45 damage each.

Awesomenauts,3dp4ln,InternationalCow,3,Sat Jul 18 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think harass is one of your better options.  Hide in places, then dash through him and away before he is out of stun.  Try to force him to play carefully and wear him down.  Use your mobility to starve him of creeps.  Otherwise, Swiggins definitely has the advantage in the matchup.  Another option is to avoid him whenever possible, again using your mobility to your advantage."
Awesomenauts,3dp4ln,Keebsy,2,Sat Jul 18 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is just catching Swiggins off guard with the rest of your team. A Swiggins at the same skill level as the Frog should never lose a fight 1v1 since Swiggins just has a complete advantage, being able to shut down your escape and your tornado, along with disgusting amounts of single target burst rivaling that of Clunk.    pleasenerftheswashbucklingsquidronimo"
Awesomenauts,3dp4ln,KEEVAN1234,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Focus on poke damage until you have a big advantage in terms of health, positioning, etc. To help with that, you start by moving Mutant Ninja Worms earlier in your build so you can dash, hit him with the 180 damage shot, and quickly get out before he can land a hook. If he does and drops his anchor, pick up Can't Touch This, activate 'Nado on the hook so you can destroy it, and run away to safety. The shield should protect you from any of his follow up damage.  Also, keep an eye out for Poolboy. Once he has that, you don't want to engage with the pokes I mentioned above unless you've got a HUGE advantage."

Awesomenauts,3dmavc,KEEVAN1234,3,Fri Jul 17 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Vsync is honestly better left on in most cases since all it does is synchronize your GPU's possible FPS with your monitor's refresh rate. With VSync off your GPU will just produce as many frames as it feels like, say 1200+ if you're running an older game, meanwhile your monitor is only going to take 60 of those frames and actually use them. Leaving it on will reduce the overall workload of the GPU and reduce screen tearing.    Tl;dr turning Vsync off is just good for people who want to brag about super high framerates in games, or people who are testing how much a game is actually straining the GPU."

Awesomenauts,3dnhdk,Jalof,3,Fri Jul 17 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"I could recommend you nibbs, swiggins, froggy g and penny. Based on your description."
Awesomenauts,3dnhdk,Kngrichard,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"Froggy G is the glass canon of AN, with amazing burst, and amazing versatility to apply that burst (nado tweeter chasedown!). But he is also one of the harder nauts to play due to have a small health bar. Definitely not beginner friendly, but he favored by many good players."
Awesomenauts,3dnhdk,yuphorix,2,Fri Jul 17 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"Froggy, Penny, Nibbs, Leon (Invis Assassin), Coco, Ayla, Vinnie, Rocco (Lone range snipe assassin)  These are what I believe to be the assassins in game, some are assassins that have a high damage burst others are characters that do high damage over a period of time.  Some tips for being an assassin which in this game accounts for pretty much any character that can run in with burst and run out is to pick your fights correctly. Most heavy characters can throw your burst right back at you if you are not smart e.g Clunk, Sentry, Swiggins. Another tip would be attempt to save your teammates if you can get out without dying, since your low hp bar droid farming can be pretty bad as well as the inability to stop pushes (except pretty much only Vinnie, Ayla, and possibly Penny) so having at least 1 of your team on the map can be pretty crucial."
Awesomenauts,3dnhdk,Slevens_,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"Leon is probably the best assassin imo, he can go invisible and with some skill have some pretty fantastic ganks.  He also has the ability for some pretty unique and fun builds - offering some diverse gameplay."

Awesomenauts,3djo8n,minic78,7,Fri Jul 17 04:58:32 2015 UTC,"Well (My personal experiences) if I play in a good EU lobby (60-90 ping all round) they do actually have to hit the enemies dead on. However if I play with my NA friends or go against Worldwide players in EU than the hitbox expands a little, seems to find a common ground between players screens.  Imo, a laggy Coco is worse than a laggy Rocco, sure arrows can hit you from a few steps in front however a laggy Coco ball will hit harder with an increased explosion range.  Side-note; Are you sure you are not going against explosion-pc Rocco's? The upgrade gives and explosion in a range of 8 on contact with enemy nauts."

Awesomenauts,3djo8n,Slevens_,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"I think the hitbox is too big, but I dont' think its' the worst.  Both of rae's moves, clunk and derpls explodes, Ted's shotgun, and coco's ball are all worse.  The issue with hitboxes in this game is that they are programmed to all be squares.  So with clunk it's the most stupid, but if you are outside of his circle, the corners of the invisible ""box"" can still catch you, meaning the hitbox actually goes outside of hte circle on the 4 corners.  It's the same with everyone elses.  Rocco's shot is just the most effected by lag which makes it 100 times worse."
Awesomenauts,3djo8n,ZubbleTheFearless,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Rocco is just too powerful. His AA hardly requires aim, the larger arrow always magically hits me, he can slow and deal so much damage to all nauts and droids, simply with his autoattack and lastly, who thought it was a good idea to have such a nasty cooldown on that dumb arrow.   I used to be excited for new characters to get me back into awesomenauts, but these 'betanauts' think these new characters are fine and suddenly you realise how unnecessarily OP they can be and nerf it.

Awesomenauts,3dk9i2,KEEVAN1234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"I don't see why building hawk bomb necessitates -I'm assuming you're talking about the Quickdraw Bow- the third arrow.

It was godlike because it opened the possibility to harass them without end with practically no risk. They just couldn't come up with a strategy to counter the arrow-spam.

Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,gunman9998,11,Thu Jul 16 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"It really is too good of an ability, given the fact that it can completely shut down a chunk of the roster in any area he wants it. I'm not sure it should be completely removed, but it needs to be toned down a bit. It's a tool that can easily be used for stopping pushes or escape or to immediately gain territory or an advantage in a team fight. With cloud size increase it becomes even more devastating.  Plus with solar cloud as an early game utility, simply bullying him early game is no easy task when you're up against any competent vinnie."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MrMrUm,7,Thu Jul 16 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"I figure it's rocketeer that makes silence cloud broken.   The combo is really, really good and can shut down entire teams.   In about the time it takes to cooldown for Dynamite, Vinnie can drop a massive silence cloud that ignores BKM (because of how it reapplies constantly) for several seconds and makes an entire section of the map unusable to one team.   Droids can't fight, you can't see, and you can't use 2/3s of your arsenal (the 2/3s you spent the most solar in, most likely) until that cloud is gone.     Silence cloud on its own is alright, and is mostly usable in situations where someone was already screwed (cocoon, throw, etc), but rocketeer is unavoidable. You cannot push through rocketeer silence and you cannot go around it without swapping lanes first.   It immediately has an effect on matches once a Vinnie has this combo."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,irrzir,3,Thu Jul 16 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"While I fully agree that Rocketeer is what makes silence cloud a truly fearsome ability due to the sheer area of its effect that occurs so quickly, I wouldn't say silence cloud on its own isn't already pushing it. Silence cloud's base size is already nothing to laugh at; it still is unavoidable given tight, and generally important, choke points in maps where you are still immediately forced to retreat or be at a disadvantage. The ability of stopping pushes is something base cloud already achieves pretty effectively with its simple but effective droid stopping from a distance powers. Rocketeer only makes it more ridiculous in this case.  Also, if something were to be changed in the overly powerful current silence cloud, it would be easier and probably wiser to change the silence aspect of it rather than Rocketeer, since size cloud on its own can be effective but isn't overpowered."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MrMrUm,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"But it does almost nothing against AA builds. As Leon main, I laugh at silence cloud."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,foobar5678,3,Thu Jul 16 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"Sure it has less of an effect but it still cuts off your abilities, which on Leon are your escape and to a more significant extent your powerful pull/chase ability. Either way focusing on AA causes your build to generally be less effective for most other nauts. Even in the case of AA builds not being affected as much by silence cloud, you can't say the same for your teammates when it's popped in team fights, a primary use of the ability."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MrMrUm,8,Thu Jul 16 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"The silence should just have a set time to it when someone steps in the cloud rather than constantly refreshing, that would make it fairer IMO."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,Digimon_Lover,-2,Thu Jul 16 08:59:48 2015 UTC,":/ That's what people want for Leons invis too, I am fine with how these are."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,Slevens_,7,Thu Jul 16 09:14:28 2015 UTC,That's a completely different and irrelevant matter.
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MrMrUm,-2,Thu Jul 16 13:24:04 2015 UTC,Well actually people are calling (on this thread) that Vinnie's silence should have a timer from when you step into it. People also want a timer on Leon's invis.
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,Slevens_,7,Thu Jul 16 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they're very different abilties and people want certain timers on them for very different and separate reasons. That's like saying the timer on Skree's totem and the slow duration timer on Coco's blaze are relevant to eachother. They're not."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MrMrUm,6,Thu Jul 16 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I wish they would replace it with a silence pulse upon using smoke cloud, similar to Sentry's teleportation. This would make it so that timing when the cloud is placed is more important compared to now where you can just throw it down and stop caring about it."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,KEEVAN1234,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"That's actually a fantastic suggestion. It doesn't render silence totally useless as you can dive in and use cloud immediately, but it also doesn't restrict the other team so much during team fights as OP mentioned. I would love to see this change."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,SwankyMango,3,Fri Jul 17 00:35:23 2015 UTC,Vinnie can't take a punch for shit like most assassin characters.

As long as you stay in the cloud the silence will reset. it would be better if it just did it one time and be done. He can still use it to escape and it can still be useful in team fights. That way if he decides to stay in the cloud and fight he can, but its dangerous and can have a consequence if he chooses to stay instead of escaping."

Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,photoperitus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"An idea (if any of you beautiful devs are listening out there):  The silence upgrade now only applies to the beginning burst of the cloud, the moment Vinnie pops the cloud. That way, it can still be useful for a short burst of silence on the enemy team without completely shutting that area out for the duration of cloud. I think this makes the combo of silence and Rocketeer much less brutal, but still useful. Maybe to balance this, the silence could last a bit longer so it's not too heavy of a nerf.  Thoughts?"
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,floatingfast77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"its strong but its also not an early game ability. Most vinnies need to build in a bunch of spike dive damage before getting silence or utility upgrades. Is it really much different from an upgraded derpl nuke, Clunk Explode, Ted air strike, or Sentry black hole as a zoning tool? I'm not saying its not powerful but by the time he has it you should start having big upgrades of your own to either make him commit or punish when he come in for the cloud or to just push the other lane quickly instead."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,MisguidedWizard,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Vinnie is a very low HP naut, that's not to say that he can't pop in and turn a fight around with his cloud now and again, but as long as he is taken care of he doesn't get the chance to get rolling. Vinnie must be bullied early game so he cannot gain the solar needed to be useful to his team, as you're saying just the silence cloud is needed for Vinnie to be useful (rather that this discussion is on Vinnie's cloud). In most matches as long as Vinnie isn't constantly tailing his allies that means there's a chance to take him out before the fight begins, and if not then their team must be avoided. Taking other objectives in the meanwhile can give your team solar advantage, and you may possibly spread their team thin in their attempt to stop you from taking objectives. I've not seen any tournament matches lately, is Vinnie meta right now? If so check out how they play and how they're handled, if you're worried about team play. In ranked online matches though I don't believe Vinnie is even picked that often, and if he is his team probably isn't coordinating the way they'd need to be to use his smoke to it's fullest potential. If somehow you face a really good team online then good luck, unless you brought your own team you're already at a disadvantage. Studying meta matches may give you the know-how to pull through, if you explain the plan to your allies they may end up impressing you. This is just my two-cents after all though, I've never felt Vinnie's cloud was too strong."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,AnthoKubo,2,Thu Jul 16 06:24:08 2015 UTC,In tournaments (AAC2) he was picked often because he was cheap to build with high burst and good initiating. Certainly not OP though.
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:42:17 2015 UTC,"He's not the cheapest to build. A lot of vinnie picks were counter picks to Scoop/Penny. Silence cloud does wonders against Nauts who are ability heavy. One major thing people might forget, in competitive Vinnie isn't an initiator. He's cleanup. The only way he can engage is if he picks up Silence/Regen cloud. To combat it, kite him outside his cloud and use abilities before you enter the cloud. I honestly, don't see it as being broken for what Vinnie lacks, his HP. Count his CD's, predict his dash and burst him either before or after he drops the cloud, you never want to be fighting in it."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,CoinCheck,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"Finally someone talking about this. This naut is broken. Silence cloud is the single best upgrade in the game, this upgrade alone makes vinne a top tier. Cloud already from default completely stops a droids push making it an already strong ability for stalling. Now add in very very easy to hit Aoe burst damage and you have a broken character. Also adding this with size makes it a huge 5 second Aoe silence and by 5 seconds the team fight is normally over. Luckily due to the fact vinne is a quite old and passive character he is not being played that much in Q but in competitive vinne is disgusting.He utilizes the already stall like meta to get to his silence cloud and dmg which then makes him win almost every team fight. lots of people think its balanced because of vinne lack of mobility and low health but that is in fact not true vinne really don't need high speed to escape when he has silence cloud and dash to use as escape tools and as for low hp silence means even if he dashes in nothing can burst him down as the enemy only have auto attacks to kill him.   Please fix this upgrade I can't take it anymore how it has been in the game this long blows my mind."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,retroXD,0,Thu Jul 16 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"yes, it's part of the OP Vinnie Standard, including 70 damage dash, dash radius increase, and solar cloud.  It's ok though, Rocco is even easier and more OP than vinnie, so all the scrubs that played vinnie shifted over to rocco for now."
Awesomenauts,3dh5rz,ZubbleTheFearless,-4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"There are other nauts that are broken, Vinnie is not one of them. Silence cloud is powerful and a good upgrade for the team.

Awesomenauts,3dj2yr,GunoSaguki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:50:32 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think he does need another .1s delay on firing explosive drones.

Awesomenauts,3dj2yr,ZubbleTheFearless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Well he is a pusher now, so his damage is like most other characters. However I do see your point, he can fire his drones pretty quickly for a ranged 1000 burst."
Awesomenauts,3dj2yr,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"I think Voltar is in a very good place atm, before he couldn't make it in a lane by himself for half a second.  Now people have to strategize before taking him to the slaughterhouse. His health is low enough that his rate of attack isn't a true concern for most nauts, get him while he's missing droids."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,floatingfast77,3,Thu Jul 16 04:14:40 2015 UTC,"Watch his upgrades carefully. There are a few ways to build Ted.  1) AA - Will melt turrets, and enemy nauts, all around a safe pick  2) AirStrike - Full burst airstrike, hope and pray you hit the enemy, or you will be out for the brawl with your lack of AA  3) Hybrid - This is the airstrike stun build that you are encountering. It's a mixture of the stun locking you in so the airstrike hits you hard and fast  Countering 1 and 2 is somewhat easier than the Hybrid. For 1, Burst/kiting works very well, If Ted launches an airstrike behind you, you can either run into his shotgun or the airstrike. Trying to avoid both is extremely difficult and will not yield the best results. You always want to keep ted at half HP, if he's at half, he will be a bit more hesitant to engage with his airstrikes. A lot of people don't predict that you will run towards ted instead of away from him when he launches his airstrike, so use that to your advantage. Hopefully Ted will be on the bottom lane for most of the game, so you may be able to avoid him for a good portion of the game, but if he's on the top lane, this is your chance to strike. He is a single jump character to use his slow lane switches to your advantage. Catch him off of his CD's in a 2v1, and you will be able to pick up a kill.   Now, the hybrid. Dealing with the hybrid in this case is a real pain in the ass. If you get close, he hits the airstrike and stun and leaves you in a world of pain, if you play passive, he will melt your turrets anyway. So, where do we begin?  We begin with counting his cool downs. Probably the most important part of countering him is being able to fight him when he is off CD's His airstrike and Stim pack have a decently long CD, so if you survive his engage, feel free to pounce on him with your team. You've stated you play frog, great! The only problem is, if he catches you off your CD's you're screwed. The stun will bring you out of the Rbay you thought was a great idea, and his airstrike deals a huge chunk of damage. Coco....Silver Coating may be your best bet to survive engages with him, but you need to make sure you're not brawling him alone. When you engage with either of these characters, try and bait his airstrike into his stim switch. Meaning, if you're a frog, Just dash into him, don't use your nado yet, and let him waste his abilities, then continue to go back in with Rbay. Coco, same thing....bait him.  Bait his abilities, remember his CD's, and watch his lane switches, strike during a lane switch, and when he's on CD. As per his bursty teammates. His team will more than likely not always be with him. Ted can sustain a lane by himself and capitalize if given a free push. You'll more than likely see him solo'ing the bottom lane. a 3 man rush on him may not be the worst idea either. If you can quickly burst him down, it will clear up the bottom lane.  TL;DR: Count his Cool Down, Kite him, Brawl when he can't use Abilities, or burst."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,CoinCheck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:12:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions everyone! I've taken it all into account and also taken /u/SheepOnDuty 's advice and started playing Ted with this build. I'm actually having a great time and have won a few rounds!
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,ZubbleTheFearless,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"Ted's low speed is his weakness.  Shotgun pushing ends up being his only defense against assassins and such.  He also gets weaker as the game goes along, because he can't move as fast, and having to travel further from the safety of his turrets means he's more vulnerable.  basically, mobility is his weakness.  If you are playing a fast character, dance around him.  Don't attack him directly at first (unless you've surprised him).  If you do initiate an attack on him, move away quickly, because he's going to shot gun you.  All it takes is one shotgun hit for him to get you where he wants you.  If you keep coming at him after he lands a shot gun blast, a good ted will be able to juggle you around the remaining shots.  Which is what makes stun so good.  Dance around him.  As frog, get in close then dash through and away from him.  Bait his shotgun and stun-stim out.  Same with Coco.  Harass him.  Get good with landing ball lightning.  Get cooldown reduction on it, and blaze on ball, so you can force him into a tighter space.    If there are no enemies or obstacles, and you are close to him, don't take the traditional path of escape (away from him toward your base).  Good Teds will expect that, and shot where you'll be going.  Juke around him, under him, into him, erratically, sometimes in what would be the intuitively ""bad"" place to be.  He'll waste a shot shooting where he assumes you'll go.  Jump at him and at the last second pull away.  Once he's wasted 2-3 of his shotgun bullets and his stim, then you can attack him more aggressively.  he's very weak to harass and surprise burst, but very strong against straight forward confrontation and brawls.  But even in brawls, when his shotgun is out of bullets, he's much easier to handle, and will usually run away."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,SheepOnDuty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:36 2015 UTC,Well thanks man really appreciate the compliment!
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,Slevens_,0,Sun Jul 19 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"So the way I'd say for you to do this is to make him waste his stim, make him proc it then go deep in for the kill, works also with Rocco's vengeance. Frog: You can always stun him with dash into nado!  Coco: Kb ball him into turrets, teammates and deep into your area  Penny: All about landing pulses and pounces.  Vinnie: Double Spikes and Silence-Size-Cloud  Ayla: Well it is Ayla, so draw him out into mid, eye him then kill off with rage vice-versa works too  Rocco: Vengeance arrows and PS's will do the trick, enables for pretty easy kills as it slows Ted right down  Skree: AA is probably the best as the stim won't shut you down  Nibbs: Ted counters her pretty hard so it is best to get him in a choke position then to firebreath him.  Rae: Trap in timerift  Leon: Sneak up on him, all about landing those tongues and backstabs!"
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,Digimon_Lover,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:24:36 2015 UTC,"For once Slevens and I agree! a Ted is weak once Stimpak is used for 11 seconds which is a long time to be in their face and dealing damage! Just be agressive with them, that's the only way to keep a high league Ted player under control. They will farm like no other character will so try and minimise the droid farming they can commit to as well, otherwise their solar lead  will give them a huge advantage."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,Slevens_,2,Thu Jul 16 09:59:34 2015 UTC,For once? :D
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,Laterow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:12:51 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your post, it feels like you are mostly describing how to waste the stim pack. The thing that OP is describing (I think) is when Ted shoots an air strike and then uses the stun on stim pack to lock you into the air strike. This can be particularly brutal if two fully upgraded air strikes are shot on top of each other. It also means that he will consequently be in stim mode, so you are basically screwed twice.  In general, I always try to focus on when Ted will shoot his air strike and, more importantly, where it lands. If you are afraid of the stun, then your goal will be to dodge the air strike and not go into it as long as you are fighting Ted (due to the stim pack stun). If he manages to shoot the air strike onto you, simply spam dash as froggy and try to get away; as Slevens said, there will be an opportunity to kill Ted after the stim pack died down. In general, you may want to keep moving around Ted, e.g. as Coco, to make it harder for Ted to aim the air strike.   Just my 2 cents, OP.  Edit: Also, obviously the same thing counts for air strike as for stim pack. The cooldown on air strike is 10 seconds, so you can also just try to make Ted waste the air strike, making the stun strategy useless. This is what I tend to do, as most of my mains are too slow to dodge the air strikes properly."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,robochase6000,2,Thu Jul 16 10:37:01 2015 UTC,"i've been playing a lot of ted lately, and it never occurred to me to activate stim pack stun to trap someone in an airstrike.  the timing seems tricky, but this sounds awesome. so thanks for sharing :)"
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,Slevens_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"I've just started playing Ted and it's not nearly as hard as you'd think! It's a lot of clicking (right-click to launch airstirke, center-click to switch, right-click to stimpack) to land a single burst, but it always throws the enemy off and they usually just run like hell after that. If you have a good bursty team behind you, they have a lot of time to capitalize on the stun too."
Awesomenauts,3dgv96,SheepOnDuty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, however with floating playing lightweight 0.5 seconds iirc you have the potential of 4 teleport/dash characters so the second is wasted if the dash is up.  Yeah I was talking about wasting stim however your point about stun into airstrike is correct!"
Awesomenauts,3dg42s,twitchtwitchmm,5,Thu Jul 16 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Ted Pros: Great at pushing, great damage output from abilities and AA, fantastic at harassing opponents vertical of him.    Cons: Terrible jump, slow speed, very little horizontal range, no escape mechanism.    How to counter: Very prone to any slows, stuns, displacement, etc. Getting two nauts to sandwich him will basically always result in him dying. Avoid being anywhere vertical of him, and keep your distance horizontally.    Penny Pros: Great movespeed, great burst, 3 (4 with boots) jumps, great escape ability.    Cons: Low health pool, slows make her jumps pathetic.    How to counter: Like most other nauts, slows and stuns are your best friend against Penny. Her pitiful health makes her very easy to burst down, but you have to be wary that she can output some crazy damage as well.    Sentry Pros: One of the best abilities for setting up kills, good jump for controlling height, ""great"" escape (will talk about this more later.)    Cons: Slow movespeed, lowish damage output from everything.    How to counter: Sentry thrives off converting your damage into damage of his own from blackhole sun. Blackhole sun is an ability where he puts up a shield which converts damage taken into damage for the blackhole then after it is fired off it will lock you in the center of it (or at least try to) and deal damage with an explosion at the end. This ability is VERY dangerous and should be avoided at all cost, since it can both deal a lot of damage and setup for his teammates to deal significant damage. The cooldown is somewhat long, so after it is used you can harass/kill Sentry safely. His other ability allows him to teleport IF he hasn't been damaged in a certain period of time (2 seconds IIRC.) ANY damage over time shuts this ability down completely, and makes it impossible for Sentry to escape.    Skree Pros: Great at pushing, great at harass, great at clearing droids, great at trapping nauts, fantastic hover jump, extremely high burst potential.    Cons: Fairly slow movespeed, somewhat expensive upgrades, requires great coordination for maximum strength, lowish health pool.    How to counter: Similar to Penny, Skree is very prone to being burst down, and can't handle displacement well since his jump isn't the highest in the world. He lacks a reliable escape since his totem ability requires you to be far enough that it can get between both of you. His sawblade is predictable when far away, but up close it can become very scary in terms of damage. It can turn into 700+ damage instantly by the end of the game, and even more if you get locked down somewhere by stuns and snares. Be very cautious around Skree, and don't put yourself in a position where totem can block you off.    Nibbs Pros: High DPS AA, highest damage ability in the game, 2 jumps, great escape, can become a monster in a premade.    Cons: Low health pool, very low movespeed, not a threat at long range.    How to counter: Keep your distance at all times. Getting close to Nibbs is a good way to get yourself killed. If you need to close, you need to know if firebreath is actually on cooldown or else your fight could turn around very fast. It's very hard to corner Nibbs since her escape allows her to leave a teleporter per se behind that she can return to at any time within a few seconds of using it. This will require teamwork to finish her off. Make sure no matter what you do NOT get cornered, snared, stunned, slowed, etc by/near Nibbs. It is a very easy way to die since you'll likely be taking 500-700 damage very quickly, maybe more depending on how long you're stuck."
Awesomenauts,3dg42s,KEEVAN1234,3,Thu Jul 16 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"Tip for playing against sentry:  He can only use teleport if he hasn't been damaged for the last 2 seconds. DoT will shut down teleport hard. If you see that he's built into teleburst (double tapping telepor on topt of your face to deal huge damage, upgrades are circuits of time (leaves a decoy) and yellow king pages) then it is especially crucial to shoot him as he approaches, as this will stop him being able to use it. Also he will escape you if he can stay undamaged for 2 seconds, so keep hitting him whenever you can in a chase situation; dont wait for your burst or whatever."

Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,AppleEngi,5,Wed Jul 15 08:58:16 2015 UTC,"If your team has trouble defending or pushing, then you have to be the pusher. Genji is flexible enough that he can fill in for a weak part of your team. No push? Get last pieridae and cocoon all the enemy druids you can, then get prefab cocoons to make pushing towers easier. No lockdown? Get slow on cocoon to make it hard for any enemy to survive getting cocooned, then get misfortune cookies for some extra damage. Teammates too squishy? Get speed and heal on blessing to help them survive fights and to chase down those nauts that barely got away. He's actually a very diverse character with many viable talent options. I hope that answers your question in a bit of a different way, since genji can work with most team comps. But for the record, I would never choose genji if I saw that there was a yuri on the team, and I wouldn't choose him if there was a Voltar and no tanky character for Voltar to stick to."
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,gfruyka,2,Wed Jul 15 16:01:20 2015 UTC,Thank you! That really helps in figuring out the right times to buy upgrades as well as when I should and shouldn't be Genji.
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,gfruyka,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:28 2015 UTC,"No problem! Genji has been my favorite character for quite a while, and I like to help out people who have questions about him since everyone always seems to underestimate him.   The most important thing to remember though, is not to lock yourself into a certain build until you know what you need to be doing to benefit the team. So I always grab my AA upgrades (I like to piggy bank to get +range, and both stacks of praying beads, then buy storm drum next), then cocoon/Boots.  By that time, you should have a good idea where your team is lacking. Almost always, I get Jagra eggs on cocoon soon as I can, since that's probably the best all around cocoon upgrade. If the team is doing good at pushing and defending, I get blessing upgrades after Jagra eggs, rather than continuing with cocoon, though I'm sure some people would disagree with that.  If we can't push, that's when I'd get polymorph before blessing; if we can't kill and the game is evenly matched with no one making any real pushes, that's when the slow comes out and you start trying to make plays with your team.  This is an older replay that I think helps demonstrate a few of my points: http://awesomereps.phexion.com/post/306 , and shows that Genji can be a thing to be feared if built right for the circumstances.  Sorry for the rant!"
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,rightoversoup,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:21 2015 UTC,Ted McPain pairs excellently with a timed airstrike right as cocoon let's out. A Tedris Ville snipe can also catch the fleeing naut on low health.

Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,Kngrichard,3,Wed Jul 15 09:10:25 2015 UTC,I would say always go for the DoT and Storm on his AA first as they give you a huge amount of early damage. Then I would build into cocoon and shield.
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,FlawlessHappiness,3,Wed Jul 15 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, always cocoon right away. Shield can wait though. Cocoon is such a setup tool, plus it is your goto escape."
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,FlawlessHappiness,2,Wed Jul 15 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"This is my Genji Build.  It focuses on AA harass, and healing/buffing of teammates.

That's just preference though."
Awesomenauts,3dd1m0,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"No. You're going to get storm drum in early game anyway, and while it's good for farming it's also good for area denial.  If you don't pick dot in the beginning, there's really no big reason to get it. It's good in the beginning because enemies don't have much health.

Awesomenauts,3dduhf,KEEVAN1234,-5,Wed Jul 15 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, not really.  The fact that you need to take a utility item just to basically survive timerift means timerift is broken."
Awesomenauts,3dduhf,floatingfast77,6,Wed Jul 15 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"Timerift isn't broken though, and it takes a well coordinated team to fully capitalize on it. I do think timerift needs a slight nerf in DPS since just below 400 DPS IIRC is a bit too much it seems when you can exclusively use it to shut down any push, but using it against nauts is difficult and even L1 Raelynns can't abuse timerift to the point where it warrants a complete overhaul of slow potency and damage.    Also worth noting that most of the time people die to timerift, it's because their positioning is horribly off. When I messed around with Raelynn for a while, most of my timerift kills were off people overextending pushes or cornering themselves in creep areas and such. Ted can also do something similar with double stunstrikes and stunpack making going through them dangerous, but it could have been avoided in the first place by either taking a different path or just winning the engagement before you got into a situation like that.    Also continuing your argument that buying a utility item makes something OP, that would also make Gnaw OP since without regen he basically wins games if he can apply DoT at a fairly constant rate, and with more ways to navigate his DoT using drip and split spit, it is much harder to avoid than a timerift while applying instant damage and damage that will linger with your for a few seconds, plus possibly a slow on top of that.    Tl;dr, Raelynn is really good right now but is slightly worse compared to last patch and she doesn't currently warrant a nerf."
Awesomenauts,3dduhf,Digimon_Lover,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"This is right on the money. Sure, it has very high DPS, but the only time you can really use it to kill an enemy naut is if they're basically so far out of position they're probably going to die regardless.  It's also worth pointing out that after it is placed it's completely stationary, so it really is one of the easiest attacks to avoid if you keep an eye on Rae to see if she's about to toss it out."
Awesomenauts,3dduhf,boydorn,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"No, that's why the utility item exists, to counter certain characters."

Awesomenauts,3dduhf,otisinthedark9,9,Wed Jul 15 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"NO. Raelyn has an animation that gives away TR, and only a fool gets caught in it after seeing this.

Either way, it's way to easy to use and land.  Everyone gets caught in it, because it's up every few seconds.  Not only that, it clears droids better than anything else in the game, stops 3v1 pushes against towers or enemies, and it's amazing at pushing against towers (again, 3 defending a tower against 1 rae) because she can just put timerift right up against the tower and kill anyone trying to get through.  It needs a nerf.  facing the same character in every match because such an easy to use skill is so powerful makes the game way less fun then mild nerfs characters need."
Awesomenauts,3dduhf,floatingfast77,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"It certainly doesnt. Theres plenty of nauts that have abilities just as good as TR.  Every few seconds? cooldowns generally only last a few seconds so I don't see how this is a special case for TR here.  Its a barrier. You can't even shoot it that far. just use BKM and its pretty much useless. BKM negates many abilities that people find troubling such as TR, yet no one uses it."

Awesomenauts,3dcvuu,dardarian89,6,Wed Jul 15 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"If it's easy, and you have Allies who benefit greatly from the extra dosh, get it done. Ayla and Rae can kill it absolutely no problem with base Rage/Timerift (one stage of damage in either makes life a lot easier though).  In the really late stages of the game, it can be easy enough to kill to literally serves as a full heal, as most maxed 'Nauts can kill it in under 5 seconds.  A lot of players are put off because of the Solar Bosses high firepower and difficulty early on (for most nauts) to kill.

Awesomenauts,3dbavr,ToxicDuck867,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Haha sure. It's a pretty standard Penny build based on getting Bug Jars ASAP because the damage is amazing. I also always get Zurians Mechanic early because I very often get kills from the VERY quick Pounce+AA+Pulse that you can see several times in the video. People hang right in front of their turret expecting to be able to run behind it but Penny is so quick that they don't even see her coming before she can Pounce-Pulse them. Of course you're then screwed if anyone else is around because you have no charges and on CD but in the right situation it's an awesome burst that you can do really early. With only Zurian Mechanic and base Pulse and Pounce you get 59 damage (30 from 4 charge Pounce, 9 from AA immediately after Pounce, 20 from 2 charge Pulse). Great for early game and it only gets better.  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Penny_Fox/1010000112300010202001001010/27-25-1-3-8-11-11-11-9-10-10-17-19-17-19  If I am getting a lot of facetime with people without getting bursted, I build AA first  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Penny_Fox/1010000112300011202001001010/8-1-27-25-3-17-17-19-19-16-11-11-11-9-10-10  If I am facing a gnaw, I do med-i-can instead of piggy.  If I am facing coco, leon, clunk, lone, nibbs, froggy, ayla, skoll, derpl, vinnie, penny, or sentry I will often build Silence on Pulse instead of Death Lens.  When facing Vinnie I will often build Electric Bike Lock (extra damage on Pounce) before Pulse because it allows me to get in his face and get him to use his dash to escape rather than burst me and my team.  If I can't get anywhere near the enemies without getting destroyed I'll go Spiderbird Collector Badge (ranged AA) and then build into AA speed then Damage - but I don't enjoy it."

Awesomenauts,3d819t,Jagzilla,6,Tue Jul 14 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"Welcome back friend!  I personally do not play Voltar, meta appears to focus on Warpgate, explosion damage and more drones. He is less dps effective as old Voltar shot 3-4 shots at once, now it is one at a time.  Lightweight bursters are meta now; Penny, Coco, Frog etc. all meta characters because of them being good!  Scoop is without doubt one of the easiest if not the easiest character in the game, I will quote Ronimo here : ""Scoop was designed to be for newer players because he is easy to get settled in to."" Scoop meta was to build Hammer when he had a low 4.5 seconds call down (with cd upgrade) now imo better to build Bindings first. http://nautsbuilder.com/#Scoop_of_Justice/1031001133200013020101301002/1-8-25-11-11-10-10-10-7-4-3-3-3-18-18-23-23-23-9-9-9-28-28-20-16-16-16 This is what I build atm however I will switch upgrades like BKM and Yellow Cone out if I need something else.  If you can her spin time is pretty slow so jump over her/dash through her. Other than that if she has used her Teleport and comes at your turret or attacks you, get your team to jump on her and kill her while she can only run.  StarStorm characters are amazing! Skree will be used because of his new skin that recently came out and he is prominent in L3 and under however Nibbs is used because she has a tendency to be easy if you build fire burst while the enemy has no idea to stop it or get out of it. From what I noticed while grinding ladder Penny/Sentry/Ted appear more as you get into L2/L1 because of skill requirements. Sentry doesn't need as much skill as he used to however can be countered pretty hard. Penny requires charges for her abilities (hit enemies to get them) so her burst if not near hit-able enemies is nothing. And Ted, arguably the most skill driven character in the game right now because he gets countered really hard!"

Awesomenauts,3d6v4k,A_rabbit_foot_failed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:35:24 2015 UTC,core items These are the items I recommend getting every game as soon as you can (the order may vary). As for the other items they are all viable depending on your team composition/enemy nauts so other than the core build you won't ever have a super fixed item progression you are following.  Totem of Power is an amazing skill even without upgrades so I leave it vanilla which lets me focus on getting lots of damage/slow on  AA and saw.  More often than not I will transition into this kind of build late game skree again the order might vary and none of these are needed pickups
Awesomenauts,3d6v4k,godlax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:04 2015 UTC,I don't recommend to up the attack speed. In my experience it brings little benefits and I'd rather max out all the other rows first which hold more potential. Attack speed I'd only take in the very end as the last ability I'd skill.
Awesomenauts,3d6v4k,A_rabbit_foot_failed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:42:10 2015 UTC,I am sorry but I have to disagree. Maxing attack speed to 120 allows you to not only push turrets much faster but also gives you an attack every 0.5 seconds meaning you have 100% uptime on the AA slow. With the way Skree deals very reliable damage and slow to potentially the whole enemy team a 20% increase in DPS can translate into huge amounts of damage that can be reliably dealt out.
Awesomenauts,3d6v4k,godlax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"I personally would rather first go for the total of 40% with the Vodoo doll together and reducing it's cool down. This will push the turrets even more and allows for a wider range of application like fleeing, trapping etc.  Combine that with either the increased saw size or the homing particles and you'll get some serious damage while risking much less and disrupting the enemy teamplay.  When all this is skilled only then I'd go for the attack speed. I know, it's tempting, but increasing your action options combined with smart play beats pure damage anytime. I have played many 1:1 against your build and about 70% success."

Awesomenauts,3d7cae,Tom_Nookington,5,Tue Jul 14 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that this kind of ability belongs in this game. Ir promotes a passive playstyle, and much worse: it provides unfun moments. Maybe it's balanced for competitive reasons or whatever, but it's just not fun. It's poor game design because it leads to a lot of unpleasant moments. Dying out of nowhere when you feel safe is a MASSIVE NO-NO, and I have no doubt that many new players will be turned off the game very quickly from this kind of thing (not to mention the other mechanics that lead to similarly-bad-feeling moments, like the stealth orb and leon's invis being unlimited). These moments are FINE from a BALANCE perspective, but that doesn't mean they make for fun gameplay.  it always FEELS like pure luck for the person dying, regardless of the ""skill"" of the rocco player. and when players feel like they are dying for no good reason, they don't have a good time.  tldr: balanced or not, it's a bad choice from a game design perspective because it creates un-fun moments and will very likely steer away new players when they encounter this kind of thing for the first time.  it's not necessary CHEAP, but it FEELS CHEAP because it's an unfun mechanic for the non-rocco player. this is an online game with two teams, and it feels as is ronimo did not think about how the ability would feel for the players on the other team. MASSIVE design oversight and nearly unforgiveable.  it feels like ronimo is trying to increase the diversity of skills and the complexity of the game-- which on its is not a bad thing-- but this experiment has failed because it completely disregards what awesomenauts is all about.  ESPECIALLY since rocco's HITBOX DOESNT MATCH THE GRAPHIC and the game is loaded with lag that makes it incredibly unbearable. And the graphic is hard to see anyway. Coco's ball IS BIG AND BRIGHT and easy to see, just like nibb's fire and penny's thing. Any projectile that goes through walls should be SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VISIBLE than others. Rocco's thing gets lots in the flurry of his regular arrows.  Plus it's impossible to dodge. Even when you know its coming, see it coming, watch its trajectory, and time your jump. You die anyway because ronimo is incapable to creating hitboxes that line up with the graphic."
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,mnoise,10,Wed Jul 15 01:16:34 2015 UTC,Roccos ability is quite infuriating but it's definitely not easy to kill with.   My main tip for avoiding the arrows is to move around alot/unpredictably:  If you pop up on the mini map clearing droids for a second there's going to be an arrow coming to where your droids will move to. It's surprising how predictably people move when they think they are alone.
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,pmj714,7,Tue Jul 14 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"This this this this this. There's no reason to not use arrow the second it comes off cooldown, and if I know you're sitting in the same spot and barely moving you can guarantee an arrow will be headed your way. Mixing up how you move all the time will help dodge arrows."
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,KEEVAN1234,9,Tue Jul 14 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"I feel the hitbox for the arrow is to wide. It feels like a lot of arrows hit, that have been attempted to dodge and should have easily managed."
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,Kngrichard,3,Tue Jul 14 10:14:08 2015 UTC,I think that has more to do with lag and speed of the arrow than the hitbox itself.
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,Esption,4,Tue Jul 14 13:34:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Because I'm talking about the arrows I shoot. I sometimes go no way I should have hit that, it should have gone under or over, while I do hit them."
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,Kngrichard,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:13 2015 UTC,No I actually think the hitbox is a bit big.

I can understand your frustration though, its just getting use to him."
Awesomenauts,3d7cae,GonicUK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:49 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think I've ever seen a player get killed in his base from an arrow, unless the enemy team is already at his base, too.  You'd have to teleport with a tiny sliver of health, then meet a perfectly-timed arrow that hits you immediately after teleporting, but before you can regenerate ~300 to ~450 damage.  Doesn't seem easy to me, unless maybe the player just spams arrows at your base or something.  I honestly feel like this is way less of an issue than Coco's ball."

Awesomenauts,3d7cae,KinZSabre,-2,Tue Jul 14 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Eh, ball passes through everything. The hitbox remains broken. The knockback is still dirt cheap and OP.

Awesomenauts,3d12ju,NarwhalPlaneFucker,12,Sun Jul 12 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"IMO Cat Derpl isn't very good against people who know what they're doing. He's easily kiteable, has nothing in the way of burst, and doesn't have much to give other than raw DPS output and snares (compared to turret derpl, which, when played right, gives you DPS, huge burst, a decent slow and snares at the cost of a little bit of immobility)  Cat Derpl is good in theory, but the better you get at the game and the higher your rank is, the less viable he becomes. Just be aware that the first paragraph is very much a real issue if you ever hit L2/L1. You did mention that you're just jumping back in, though, so I'd say go nuts with the cats."
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,TheGullibleParrot,0,Sun Jul 12 17:36:25 2015 UTC,if you have no displacement and derpl has the right mates cat derpl is devastating.
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,Tanzklaue,4,Mon Jul 13 19:49:49 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. At least not the traditional cat Derpl, where you start building it out of gate and completely ignore siege. They make for good DPS if you're able to land it, but they're pretty unsafe in team fights and won't do you any favors at all for chasing.

Awesomenauts,3d12ju,TheMesp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:37:39 2015 UTC,I have played quite a bit of Cat Derpl recently and late game is when he shines the most. Derpl is too tanky to be bursted down from full health and other nauts getting tanky too means that burst damage becomes less relevant than being able to sustain a high DPS which cat derpl does well. Late game you can kill pretty much anyone that gets caught in a snare. Yes cat derpl is not particularly viable but in my experience mainly because of how weak he is right at the start of the match before you have built up the 340 solar needed for batsuit
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,godlax,0,Mon Jul 13 10:15:15 2015 UTC,"nothing outkills a derpl. the closest you get is a rocco, but even he has to bow to derpl's superior hp and DPS."
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,Tanzklaue,3,Mon Jul 13 19:43:37 2015 UTC,No. Everyone laughs at cat derpls.
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,StinInAction,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:24:46 2015 UTC,i feel like cat derp was so good on station but then they took it out =(  i feel like its meh on the other maps
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,slickmasterizzy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:42:44 2015 UTC,Derpl himself isn't really viable in higher leagues to my knowledge.
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,AvesAkiari,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"in pubs derpl is viable, because unless you have counters and the counters execute their stuff decently (or perfectly, depending on derpl's teammates) you won't kill a derpl.  the thing with derpl is that his stats are ludicrous to make up for the fact that some nauts counter siege mode and others counter cat derpl. if you don't have counters for one or either derpl is very much one of the deadliest pubbers out there."
Awesomenauts,3d12ju,Tanzklaue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"Still?... The average knowledge of players has grown so I geuss it got even worse than it used to be. If you want to play something aa focused pick up raelynn, rocco, ted or skree.  On a sidenote, derpl needs love."
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Juniperlightningbug,10,Sun Jul 12 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"You make a good point, this should be an in-game feature."
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,boydorn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"I agree.  It would be kind of awesome to have a ""shop view"" for any character, based on your current level.  But I guess if you want to test out the feel of a build, you can just make a custom game with max solar and try out whatever you want anyway."
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Keebsy,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"Problem is ingame there's no way to check when you attain whatever skill, it'll just say locked because of rank."
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Keebsy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"I see.  So you'd at least like something similar to the current system, but perhaps with a grayed-out number overlaying the skill to indicate at which level you will unlock it."
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Keebsy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Some way that provides you a way to access how to check how long it takes to attain a skill. Ideally though there should be some way to access and scroll on the bar that you see when you complete a game when you gain experience via your profile or the way you mentioned combined with a loadout screen on the main menu, someway to look that doesnt force you into a bot game or custom just to check. The information needs to be made available to all players, not just new ones, as it's constantly shifting as the game grows and wikis and 3rd party resources don't keep up"
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,santoscrew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:04 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  Making this kind of information more easily available will only aid in player retention and acquisition.
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Kalazor,3,Wed Jul 15 06:10:34 2015 UTC,Those pages are outdated. The order changes when new nauts are introduced. Last time this happened was a few days ago.
Awesomenauts,3d1djl,Grakiao,3,Sun Jul 12 18:57:20 2015 UTC,Does anywhere have an updated list? at the very least within the game client itself they should make this information available? I mean the main menu screen is like 80% wasted space
Awesomenauts,3d2zbq,SheepOnDuty,2,Mon Jul 13 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"Not a bug, but it's likely not intentional."
Awesomenauts,3d2zbq,KEEVAN1234,2,Mon Jul 13 03:21:34 2015 UTC,Its mainly because coco's shock particles have a mini explosion size. Its one of the reasons why its so good and coco has amazing droid killing power.

Awesomenauts,3czfj7,dardarian89,3,Mon Jul 13 08:18:50 2015 UTC,"Increase explosion size means you can reach behind turrents, and you have a much wider range, plus much bigger blast area."

Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,godlax,8,Fri Jul 17 08:03:20 2015 UTC,I feel like complaints about Rocco are focused on the wrong things. Every day I see new threads here by people that are annoyed they got hit by an arrow in base and say that no other awesomenaut can do something like that.  Of course Rocco is able to do something unique! If he didn't have abilities that were unique in some way there would be no point adding him to the game. Other MOBAs I play (mainly Dota2) have many more characters that all are able to do things in a way that no other character can...it is good design.   I believe if Ronimo want to balance characters in an interesting way that maintains variety of characters then they should focus on buffing the strong unique aspects of each character while nerfing the aspects of character design that aren't meant to be their strong point.  I hope when Ronimo gets round to nerfing Rocco they do this by reducing his mobility and perhaps decreasing the downtime on his vengeance even further. Perhaps also reduce the base damage of his AA and add this extra damage (with extra?) back on during vengeance. These changes would make him generally weaker and susceptible to getting easily focused and killed when he isn't in vengeance. Perhaps if these changes make him too weak they could even buff the damage of the arrow (although the hitbox/animation does need to be fixed to match each other i feel)

Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,milo09885,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:30:59 2015 UTC,I have fun with it when late joining and doing Scoop-ever-lasting (all heals binding and all health utilities). It might be more useful then Medican for characters with good sustain. It does seem pretty situational at best.

Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,TheGoldenFruit,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"This game needs to fix some things, I just can't fathom it anymore, it's getting more and more unbalanced, after almost 3 years of olaying, it's getting silly"
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,milo09885,2,Tue Jul 14 08:01:02 2015 UTC,What makes you say that? I've found it to be quite balanced except the expected OPness of a new character or character rework.
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,TheGoldenFruit,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"First off let me say that ronimo does this most if not every time a character is released. Nibbs,scoop,Ayla,Rocco,Ted,penny. All of those characters were extremely powerful upon release, some were nerfed to the ground. Some of these characters are still considered op by some, cough cough Ayla. The first thing that makes te game unbalanced is the maps, it has one wide open expanse, 2 very confined battle fields, and some weird mix of the two. Each nap favors different characters. Brawlers(most of the roster) thrive on the confined spaces, while they are considerably less potent on the other two maps, making other nauts more powerful. This is not ""balance"", you do not know which map you're getting. Another thing is the ranking system, I'm in league 3 and I've played games with league 1 players, this has even happened when I was in league 4. The connection is quite the problem as well, something I want fixed over anything else. I was facing a Rocco with my friends, we jumped the precision shot but it registered as hitting us, probably because Rocco had 300 ping, you can not play to your advantage if you're dealing with that. Late joins are also terrible, I can't tell you how many times I've been in a game dominating with no effort(ranking system...) and then a late join lone star or other, jumps in which 2000 solar and totally flips the game around, or when you join a game late and there is no coming back from the ass stomping your newly found allies are receiving, now these late join complaints also include the problems mentioned above. I'll end this wall of text on this final point, buffing/nerfing. Ronimo loves buffing or nerfing a naut way far up or way far down, they did this with Ayla(nerfed her) then a week later they buffed her to the moon, and she's still buffed, chain whack and rage are ridiculous. When they try to fix a naut they buff too many things at once, to the point where a significant portion if the players can't figure out how to play against those nauts. I hard this argument the other day with someone who said lonestars buff was well deserved, ""he's competitive now"", well if that's true, then ronimo is buffing or nerfing nauts for league 1/2. While they should be balancing nauts for the majority of players in lower leagues. I've had so many of my friends drop this game because when climbing the ladder they felt the game was unfair, in all reasons above. I don't hate the game, it just frustrates me. Sorry for the massive wall of text, also I'm using mobile so if I spelled anything wrong, just ask and I'll explain it."
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,milo09885,4,Tue Jul 14 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response. Let me point out that some of the issues you described as just inherent in the nature of this game. Upon release, most characters are on the OP side as this is advantageous in that it allows the character to be sufficiently field tested. Player's won't want to play a UP character that they don't understand the mechanics of. I also think because players don't understand the new mechanics of that character it skews the perception of that character as OP until that character is widely understood. I also think that Ronimo has gotten quite better at correctly 'powering' upon release ex. 40 DMG Shotgun Ted vs. Annoying Hammer Spam Scoop. One was annoying while the other gamebreaking.  The issues about connections and leagues is simply one that cannot be fixed. This game must use a P2P connection for it to be even able to exist. I really really want everyone here to understand how small the playerbase is for this game. You got placed with L1&2 most likely because there simply wasn't anyone else to play with. Everyone here would love to have dedicated servers and a large group of people to play with but unless Ronimo gets backed by a large developer or gets an influx of cash, they can't fix those problems.  I believe games should be balanced on the highest level of play because everyone should be aspiring to reach that. This may come off as rude, but if a certain character dominates at lower leagues, it is often due to a lack of skill or knowledge than being OP.  Ed: Maps are something that will always be unbalanced sadly. I do think not knowing the map makes it more balanced as then you cant pick a naut definitly for that map. They have made changes though if deemed too bad ex. Raelynn on old AI Statiom"
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,mnoise,7,Tue Jul 14 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"You're contradicting yourself.  Awesomenauts needs more people, that means new players. That means the focus should be on enhancing the FUN aspect of the game to NEW PLAYERS, not balancing around the competitive game.  As long as they continue to treat the game like some super-competitive esports thing, they're going to continue to have problems increasing the userbase. That doesn't attract new players-- in fact it actively turns them away. I have absolutely NO DESIRE whatsoever to play Dota or whatever, because everything I'ce seen and heard just screams ""it's gonna take you 40 hours to even understand whats going on"". That doesnt sound fun AT ALL. I just want to pick up a game and play: and it might come as a surprise, but MOST GAMERS think that way too.  Awesomenauts was great because it WASNT intimidating like those games. It looked like a blast to play. And it was. For a while. It's losing its magic.  They need to make the game fun FIRST and FOREMOST. Balance for competition later. Look at Smash Bros. Party game first.  It seems like every update moves the game further away from being a fun smash-like brawl and towards being just another newbie-unfriendly moba with an intimidating amount of shit to learn."
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,milo09885,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:00 2015 UTC,"If you read my other reply a little bit down, I touch on this. The game definitely got an identity crisis. Smash also has that same problem TBH. Depending on who you ask, it isn't a party game first but one of the most fiercely competitive fighting games. It's about finding a balance."
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,mnoise,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"But not if you ask the designers. To them, it's a party game. The players made it competitive. And that's the difference here. Ronimo doesn't appear to know what awesomenauts is."
Awesomenauts,3cwlw6,milo09885,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Of course not if you ask the creator, but that doesn't mean the competitive scene isn't huge and important. Melee is considered the competitive 'version', while the other three are really party games. What would be best is if Awesomenauts had two versions, but that simply isn't feasible. I think we are getting to the same conclusion that Ronimo is in a bit of a pickle on what to do. Do they try and get new players while possibly disenfranchising the established competitive playerbase or do they keep those who are already here and possibly let their game die? Only Ronimo can decide what they want for their game and what they think is best."

Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,dardarian89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:21 2015 UTC,However I think it is wrong to say that their are some pretty cool kills to be achieved with Precision Shot
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Modiga,0,Sat Jul 11 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"This exactly. Still not sure why Ronimo made the infinite range, it almost seems more like a bug than a feature. It's annoying and promotes people trying random shots in the direct of the enemy's base / shop just to get a lucky kill."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,binarian,17,Wed Jul 15 07:32:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think his precision shot is overpowered, but I do think it's an ability that is anti-fun and shouldn't exist.   Safe spaces in the game should be a guarantee and this removes them in their entirety. Even Coco has her limitations. If you know where an enemy Coco is, you know whether her ball will be a threat or not and can adjust accordingly. With Rocco a threat exists regardless of Rocco's position.  This means teleporting back to base with low health from somewhere well back from the front line is always a risk and it shouldn't be. Rocco's an even stupider version of Ted's snipe shot, something else I don't think should be in the game due to its unfun qualities, rather than its strength."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Modiga,3,Sat Jul 11 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting point - I'm a dota player mainly and, whilst skills that can kill in spawn do exist, they're much, much harder to land than precision shot. In fact precision shot is a kind of ironic name for a skill shot that's very hard to not hit with!  I'm okay with getting killed in the shop/spawn occasionally. Sort of makes you throw your hands up and slow clap your opponent - kinda funny. But I've seen it happen in literally every single game involving Rocco that I've played. I'd have them do away with the range finder in the minimap tbh. I think that's cheap to the point of almost being patronising."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,binarian,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"So, hypothetically, you'd be fine with Precision Shot conceptually if the shop was a guaranteed safe zone (blocking Precision Shot, Coco balls, etc.)?"
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,allink,3,Sat Jul 11 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"It should be, but it annoys me that there is now one naut with a fast moving attack that can hit you when you're in places, that no other naut can."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Modiga,-2,Sat Jul 11 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's nowhere that Rocco can shoot that Coco can't, Coco's ball is just more skill-based--and more damaging to compensate.  It's not like I think your argument is unfair or invalid, I just think its odd that people are freaking out over Rocco's ability to hit anyone anywhere, when they've long since gotten over Coco's ability to do the same."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,o0joshua0o,5,Sat Jul 11 18:45:57 2015 UTC,Rocco can shoot anywhere at any time and that's a big difference. Coco can only hit the enemy shop if the base is exposed
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Keebsy,2,Sat Jul 11 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Not in a practical sense. Coco has to be in range of you and it's often quite easy to know whether she is a threat or not. If she is on the far side of the map, you are not going to get hit by a ball whilst you teleport.   Rocco on the other hand can be anywhere and hit anywhere. There are no guarantees of safety.   Coco's and Rocco's respective moves have key differences that make the comparison completely fair. Coco's is shorter ranged and slower than Rocco's arrow. It is much, much easier to pick out areas where you will be safe from Coco, it is impossible to pick an area that is safe from Rocco."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Laterow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:07:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. It almost always seems like a cheap shot, and makes the match less fun for other players."

Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,ZubbleTheFearless,5,Sat Jul 11 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Rocco's precision shot:    Cooldown: 6s (3s with 1 stage MPL and hit someone, or more with DHB) Damage: 300 (max 435) Area: No (yes with 1 stage B&G) Range: Technically the whole map     Coco's ball:    Cooldown: 7s (5.5s with 1 stage GD) Damage: 400 (max 670, more with blaze) Area: Yes Range: 8 (max 13)     Raelynn's snipe:    Cooldown: 10s (8s with 2 stages CM) Damage: 450 (max 900) Area: Yes (well, pierce) Range: 17 (min 9, max 25)     When you look at the raw numbers, Rocco does not seem OP to me at all. The cooldown is 6 seconds at base, plus you still need to actually draw the bow and aim*. It does not come with area damage and the damage cap is relatively low. For close combat spamming, a 300-435 skill is not that good at all compared to many other nauts. For long range spamming, it can be annoying, but 300-435 damage is not gamebreaking at all.  It's also fair to keep in mind that the speed is not necessarily overwhelming (given that Rocco's ping is decent). I play Swiggins and I can still avoid most precision shots (without +30% speed). The trick is to know when the shot is coming.    If you just saw a shot fly by, then you have another 6 seconds (or maybe 3 if an ally was hit).  If you see Rocco stop using his AA, then he may be drawing his bow, so prepare to dodge.  If you are low health and a shot can kill you, do not teleport in an obvious position. Try to think where Rocco is located and try to find a spot that he will not shoot at immediately. In the worst case (if you know a shot is coming), wait for the precision shot and dodge, then teleport.   It is just a matter of getting used to before you will dodge a lot more of the shots. Right now, most people freak out when they see the shot, and they instinctively jump or run away. However, this often actually causes them to jump into the shot. With experience, people will learn how to dodge the arrow better.   And all the above is just about long range spamming. In close range, a 300-435 skill is useless compared to most nauts. Rocco may be a star in spamming arrows and getting picks behind the turrets, but he lacks in other fields of the combat.   All in all, the precision shot can be annoying, but it is not OP at all in my honest opinion. It just takes some getting used to. Maybeeeee the prices are a bit low and could use some tweaking, but I personally do not see any reason to do so.     * Granted, Rae also still needs to aim, but she can HIDE her snipe and even time when she wants to fire.. That gives significantly more control over her attack.  Edit: Took out some mistakes."

So I used the numbers because OP mentions:    Very low cooldown, decent damage, goes through all terrain, short wind-up, a bloody massive range indicator on the minimap and the ability to fire whilst moving?   Most of these (cooldown, damage, wind-up, goes through all terrains) are things I tried to address with my comparison. So I was just trying to do what OP asked. Whether it is indeed up to you :)"
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,KinZSabre,2,Sun Jul 12 19:01:04 2015 UTC,precision shot isnt the problem its his a.a before you get in range to attack him hes hit you several times already the he turns on vengeance and the damage just stacks up hes unapproachable right now
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,boydorn,2,Sat Jul 11 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"Coming from a very high L1 players point of view I definitely agree with this statement. In the current high level meta most matches contain a lot of passive wave clear poking and turret camping. The high meta also consist of top teams really only use S tier nauts e.g Coco, Penny, Scoop and so on. Bearing all these things in mind and playing as/vs Rocco I can tell this naut is defiantly up there with the top. He has great range very high dps and also great initiation as well as sick poke making him an all round nice naut not to mention how brain dead easy the naut is for any half decent player. I would say his true only weakness would be his lack of escape options, beside vengeance he really only has his speed to escape and you don't really want to be wasting vengeance for escape options. Over all this character is very strong. He has not been out long enough for me to really say weather or not he is the BEST naut but he is definitely S tier."
Awesomenauts,3cwxhj,Rydo131,2,Sun Jul 12 02:29:42 2015 UTC,Very low cool down? Its 8 seconds! I actually think Rocco is in a really good place right now. I can win about as much as I lose with him.

He lacks any basic defensive mechanics other than spit being ranged. His only cc/escape ability is a 1.2s 30% slow that he has to buy with 2 stages for 300 g which is also is one of the worse/mediocre slows in the game. He had his weedlings shifted from area denial, push and zoning to just push and zoning. The Dot effect in this game has massive disadvantages but only one minor benefit.  Gnaw has a low skill ceiling and as such a naut he doesnt necessary need to be super strong, but he isnt even on par with any other naut. So playing against players with the same skill level, you will be inferior either way (luckily matchmaking gives you lemonades most of the time).   The only time gnaw shines is the early to earlymid game, because the enemy doesnt have the money to further push their advantage of just being mechanically superior or to mitigate gnaws abilities. After that the other nauts improve but your disadvantages stick with gnaw. So either you dominate the game by then or you will have a bad time."

Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,SethThaDino,9,Fri Jul 10 16:23:12 2015 UTC,"sigh Here come the downvotes...  Gnaw is a classic case of Ronimo's trend of nerfing characters for the purpose of equality, but bringing down the collective ""power"" of all the nauts.   Moves become less ""awesome"" when they don't have the super cool, and super specific advantage they had. Popular examples are Yuri's huge ass time-bubble, Leons nerfed tongue upgrades, nibbs flame damage (not exactly a popular opinion on that last one, admittedly) and in this patch, Scoops hammer spam.  I mean, alot of those things were overpowered, but they were fucking cool little gimmicks that were personalized for the naut. Instead of brining down the power level of the crew, they should have raised the powers of the ones that lagged behind.  Sorry, I probably play too much Nauts."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,11,Fri Jul 10 10:05:24 2015 UTC,"I've heard this sentiment before, but I'm still not sure how a couple nauts having clearly op ""gimmicks"" is so cool, especially if you don't play that naut. Being able to kills far easier than other nauts without enough drawback is called imbalance, not ""gimmick."""

Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,DaEvil1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the idea is that we aren't just giving ""a couple of nauts"" ""OP"" gimmicks. Saying anything about the game is OP implies that theres an imbalance, which is obviously not the goal in any situation here.  Ultimately you should be able to play any naut, and they each have something unique that they are good enough at that it A) makes you feel like a boss, and B) is balanced with the other nauts skills.  The examples I listed above are not simply based on making more kills as you say... they are flavors that give a unique strength to each naut.  as an example people may complain that they, while playing as derpl, are continually outdamaged and out-lasted by Coco. Is the answer to nerf Coco's damage? or raise derpls defence?  One type of balance lowers the power level, one raises it. Why would you rather play with a low power-level? Its like playing a pen-and-paper RPG as normal goddamn Joe-Schmoe in a fantasy realm, instead of hardened adventurers. (although that might be a good p&p RPG plot)"
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,3,Fri Jul 10 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"There is imbalance in the game and there's no getting around that. Obviously the goal is balance. But replacing the word overpowered with unique strength or gimmick doesn't take away the facts.  You may not be talking about getting kills with your examples, but the ones you used are in fact the ones that get those particular nauts kills and make them seem overpowered.   Your analogy for Coco doesn't really work because it makes more sense to balance a character's attack then it does to balance another's defense. Cocos attacks are way more versatile then a siege shield.  But in the end complaining about some factor as vague as power doesn't really make for a compelling argument. There are no power levels in the game, there is either balance or imbalance. As a casual player who mains Genji, I know for a fact that a player can have a unique strength without being overpowered."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,flumdinger,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:55 2015 UTC,"Obviously the goal is balance.   Well, I agree with you completely but I think it's important to note that sometimes, imbalance can be better.  Either way, I feel like people use the argument that Nauts is ""trending on a negative power curve,"" too often and I just know it isn't true.  I can't find it now, but there was a post in /r/leagueoflegends a while ago that took on the same sort of accusation and counted up all the major, minor, and neutral buffs and nerfs over a year.  To the suprise of all the complainers out there, there were actually more buffs, both major and minor, over the year than there were nerfs.  The reason everyone whined was discussed and eventually people agreed that it came down to perception.  Large nerfs happen because a given champion is too good, and naturally more people play who they believe to be good.  Therefore, those nerfs affect a large number of people.  On the other side, the buffs come to those who are typically pretty weak.  Weak people aren't played as much so only a small number of people even play it in-game.  No one complains, if anyone is giving praise it is quickly drowned out by the much larger number of people complaining.  So, I believe the same thing has happened in Nauts.  People see the nerfs to Swiggins or Sentry and keep a note of it because those 2 have had massive impacts.  Then Derpl got steadily buffed each patch and everyone just waved it off as still useless because they won't even bother with a 'weak character.'  Hell, just look at the recent patch notes.  Majority fixes/polish, massive buffs to Lone and Volt, and at most a moderate nerf to Scoop.  Okay, rant over.  Sorry /u/flumdinger you didn't personally mention a negative trend, but I was in a mood to rant."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,dylanw3000,2,Sat Jul 11 07:28:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said. Thing is, the goal is balance, but I'm OK with the game never being perfectly balanced, because that is a monumental task, especially given the rate of new nauts added to the game.  I feel like as long as Ronimo is striving to make the game as fair as they can for the moment, I'm happy. They also make changes to characters for the hell of it sometimes (lonestar may be an example here) when they are pretty well balanced, just to shake things up, which I think is awesome. I just can't be in the camp that complains at every change, because I know that the dev's overall goal is to make the game fun.  I understand when people complain when they aren't sure that a change to their favorite naut helps the overall game, but most don't think of it that way. They just think, ""my naut can't do X as well as before and that is very bad because I like X."" It's a myopic viewpoint.   Sometimes people need to accept that Ronimo may want to not just cater to the existing fanbase or those were there from day 1, but to also make sure their game is accessible to those coming to it for the first time. Anyone who doesn't like that, can just invest time into another game, instead of being a drag on the whole community.   I appreciate your rant, as you made good arguments. Most importantly, you employed logic and rational thought, as well as links to drive your point home. This is how you make an argument :)  TL;DR Change is good sometimes. If you don't like it, there are many more games out there."

You may not be talking about getting kills with your examples, but the ones you used are in fact the ones that get those particular nauts kills and make them seem overpowered.    Yes some, actually most abilities can cause damage in this game. Often times they do help a team get kills. Shouldn't that be the point?   Your analogy for Coco doesn't really work   As I explained to the other guy, you could replace Coco and Derpl with any two nauts. The example was not for anything but an example to bring about the definition of Positive balance vs negative balance.   There are no power levels in the game, there is either balance or imbalance.   I'll concede that saying ""power level"" does imply imbalance. This is why I was calling them gimmicks. Semantics in my opinion.    As a casual player who mains Genji   As a casual that mains Genj, you should definitly be on my side of the issue. Genji is a great example of a character with a gimmick. Storm drum creates area denial, moderate damage, and he can spam it relentlessly to the point where an AA build is valid for the support character. Its a gimmick that separates him from the rest of the cast without making him overpowered. Every naut should be like genji in that regard."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"To me, there is no such thing as positive balance or negative balance in this game. You either have a naut with an unnecessary advantage, or naut that can be cancelled out by another (or close to it).  The word gimmick should be used to describe a unique trait, not how powerful a trait is. Gnaw's ability to zone with weedlings or genjis ability to remove a naut temporarily to get an advantage in a team fight or escape would be described as gimmicks.  ability to do massive amounts of damage or move at high rate of speed without and real downside is imbalance.   The reason I used genji in my example is because when played well, he is a perfectly balanced character. There is a reason there are top nauts in this game. There is a reason why genji hasn't been buffed or nerfed in a very long time. Certain nauts just have clear advantages over more nauts than others.   The reason for nerfs is to make the game fun for everyone. If you feel like the game is less fun when a naut gets a fix for balance, then that's something you have to deal with, as its not a tangible issue. It tells me you would rather have an unbalanced game so some nauts retain a vague unique trait that they never actually lost.  If you don't think I'm making a good argument, then we won't see eye to eye, and should agree to disagree."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,flumdinger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"To me, there is no such thing as positive balance or negative balance in this game.   Well this certainly discredits your stake in this conversation. To you, a casual player, I'm sure that there are many things about the mechanics of the game that you don't see, or don't care about. You don't exactly have a large investment in the game.   And to say that ""You either have a naut with an unnecessary advantage, or naut that can be cancelled out by another"" is a drastic over-simplification of the game. Its no wonder we don't see eye-to-eye, as you say.   The word gimmick should be used to describe a unique trait, not how powerful a trait is.   I've never once said that these gimmicks I'm talking about are directly related to the ""OPness"" of anything, so I'm glad we agree here. Heres the thing though. Gnaws awesome zoning abilities have been made near useless, and you don't see a problem with it.  This is because you play casually, which is fine. lets say Ronimo went along with the changes I outlined to in my posts to begin with; Yuri's bubble stayed huge, Leon kept some utility with his tongue, ect... I don't think you would care or notice one way or the other.   For me, and many other non-casual, hardcore, tournament players that are at the heart of the community, There is much at stake here. We are participating in tournaments, buying extra copies of the game just to give away, participating in balance discussion on the forums, and playing an active role in the developement of nauts. When a casual player chimes in and says they definitely want to keep nerfing nauts, I can't help but think you don't know what you're talking about.   If you don't think I'm making a good argument...   I think my problem with your posts are they they don't respond to my argument at all. Maybe you should consider learning more about the game before you try to make elaborate points about what changes should be made to benefit the community."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Just because I don't play the game hardcore everyday doesn't mean I don't understand how it works. I'm not over simplifying, you're over complicating, to the point where you're putting way more on this then what it really is, which is balancing. If you're going to say my argument is discredited, then you might want to detail how that is the case instead of just saying so.  Just because I support nerfs, buffs and balancing doesn't mean I was ok with crazy op stuff that was previously in the game.   What I do know is that I know enough about the game to know that you aren't making a good argument. You can't just say that there's more to it than just balance, without providing any tangible proof. ""You don't know anything"" isn't proof.  And once again, your example for gnaw is flawed. They removed his long-term area denial, that's it. All that does is change the boring build that most gnaw players would go with. Wanna play turtle all day? Too bad, try something new for a change. If you think the removal of area denial makes him a bad character, then maybe you're not playing as much as you should be.  My basic argument is that balance is balance. That is irrefutable. It doesn't matter if YOU think the game is balanced positively or negatively. If its balanced, its balanced. Now everyone can have fun. If you want to add in words like power or gimmick, be my guest, but your argument was thready to begin with and you haven't proven your case in anything you've said thus far.  Basically what it boils down to, is that I want the game balanced across the board (like any sane person), and you want it balanced for your benefit. If you decry cry any change that enables a fair fight between characters, then it isn't balance that you want, its something else."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,flumdinger,3,Fri Jul 10 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the notion to bring every character to a state where their absolute beasts. Who would want a battle when you could have a mini-war? But just ""buffing everyone up to insane amounts of power so every naut is balanced and feels awesome to play"" is stupid for Awesomenauts and MOBAs most of the time.   Imagine the balance terror if suddenly Clunk, Gnaw, Skree, etc. All the characters considered unviable for competitive, or just not high-tier were all buffed to the power level (whatever that is) of Penny? Imbalance, exploits, the whole meta would shift. What if I liked how Clunk played before he was buffed to his ""real state."" Because you couldn't possibly like a character that isn't a ""high power level"" right?  Following the Coco and Derpl example, what does happen when Derpl's defense is buffed. It's great that he can easily fend off Coco, but Coco is still his hard counter. Because of Derpl's big gimmick (no mobility for extra power in siege mode, he will always be countered by her. Coco will still be able to shoot out a ball and hit him every 5 seconds, and she will be able to escape him easily. The matchup between those two characters has barely changed. The only way you could really make Coco and Derpl equals in the ring if they have equal weaknesses and strengths against each other. Of course that would require changing how the entire character works, which is even more of a glance nightmare.  But let's pretend that the matchup between these two is now balanced. Each is very powerful and equally dangerous to each other now. What about the other nauts? Raising Derpl's defense just made it a fuckton harder for melee characters to approach! Now Derpl can turtle much much safer and longer! Oh I'm not dealing with another Derpl camping Ribbit mid, let's leave! Etc. See the problem? Well let's just buff the characters that now have problems with Derpl! And the cycle goes on.  Lastly, nerfs aren't a bad thing. Some characters need them. It's that simple. As long as it doesn't ruin the character then I don't see the problem. No, I don't want the characters to progress through a steady line of nerfs. But let's all stop pretending that nobody receives buffs, or that everyone being buffed will somehow make the game leagues better than it is now. Something something when everybody's a god, nobody will be."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,Sweggintons,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"just ""buffing everyone up to insane amounts of power so every naut is balanced and feels awesome to play"" is stupid for Awesomenauts and MOBAs most of the time.   Im not advocating ""Insane amounts of power"" when did I ever suggest that? You seem to think that by ""power level"" I mean solely damage causing abilities. Let me clarify that when I say naut gimmicks I do not mean simply a nauts damage dealing ability or threat level Some nauts are for causing more damage, some nauts are for area denial, ect. There should always be a balance, and ever naut should have weaknesses that balance out their strengths, obviously.   Because of Derpl's big gimmick (no mobility for extra power in siege mode, he will always be countered by her.   As I said, I was using Coco and Derpl as examples. Feel free to put any naut in there as a placeholder. Your detailed explanation of this example was not needed. Why would Ronimo only take one naut into consideration when trying to balance their game? That would be incredibly stupid.   Lastly, nerfs aren't a bad thing. Some characters need them. It's that simple.   Again, no one is arguing about these points. Obviously, when taking a trial-and-error approach to balancing a game, you will need to make tiny adjustments in the positive *as well *as the negative.    But let's all stop pretending that nobody receives buffs, or that everyone being buffed will somehow make the game leagues better than it is now.    Who the hell is saying these points you're bringing up? ""Nobody receives buffs?"" seems more like your trying to discredit my argument rather than answering to it with reason.  Take leon for example. The naut was overpowered, he definitely needed something changed, because he was thrashing people left and right. They raised the prices of his AA and nerfed it a little too much in my opinion, but he was still completely valid. Then they took away solar magnet. Alright, fine Leons can no longer grab extra solar with their tongue- that move was cool, but certainly we'll get something equally cool and useful as a result right? No, instead they get a useless blind skill. No one ever uses it. Its a waste of an upgrade. That was 2.7. After the lifesteal on his tongue was already nerfed into uselessness.   Leon needed alot of nerfs, yeah. But it seems like they could have left him something cool to do with his tongue. How many leon players do you see with a tongue-centered build now? the meta demands damage, so it would be stupid not to put everything into his AA. zero build diversity is the consequence of dumbing down the nauts.  Leon used to be my favorite naut, but now theres only one way to play him. This is objectively boring, so I don't play him anymore. Leon is not the only example of this either. So what point are you trying to make exactly? Should the power-level be lowered or raised, and why?"
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand fully what you mean by power-level, but as long as it's not raw strength like I thought you meant, I apologize. I just see so many people here and on the forums saying that Romino always nerfs/they should just buff everyone up.  Anyways, what are others examples of the message your trying to convey with Leon, by I've only played him like twice in my whole game time.  But even with knowing little about Leon don't see why the gimmicks are such a needed attribute towards making a character unique and offering different play styles. I mean, how much changed if you took solar tongue? Level up fast and occasionally scoop up solar under the worm? Would you not be doing the same as what is expected of Leon to do? (poke early game, aid the team with initiation, finish off low-health enemies, backdoor, etc.)  And for all the other nauts the principle still applies. If you give them each an upgrade that changes the play style, gives a unique edge, and is viable in the meta, then it is probably going to be something overpowered, underpowered or a new force that people don't know how to face yet. Balancing nightmare. Weedlings were unique in that they were the only item placed by a naut that could only disappear by Gnaw himself or a player killed them, and because of that he could nest in mid or behind turrets. That was one of the big factors while weedlings were(still are?) looked upon to be one of the most annoying abilities in the whole game.  Not to say it couldn't work, but the reason we don't see any powerful, unique, diversifying gimmicks is because they either have molded the meta or were overpowered and removed. I think the best example of this done right is Gunpenny. It doesn't change your roles as Penny but it still gives AA a different feel and gives you new options by sacrificing other good options. Still, Gunpenny is less popular and viable for the meta, but not impossible to succeed with."
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,Sweggintons,0,Fri Jul 10 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"When I say power-level, you should think of..like...levels in an RPG. You character will be much stronger, faster, and have more access to abilities if he is level 30 as opposed to level 15. The way I see it, Nauts is like a bunch of level 15 RPG guys duking it out. Thats fun, but what if it were level 30 guys duking it out? In both circumstances the scales are even (so balance is a non-issue), but the difference is the overall level of the characters.  The thing that is the most frusterating about all of this, is that players who were with Awesomenauts from the beginning had those level 30 characters, and they were nerfed down to 15 as a means of balance, instead of reworking the nauts who fell behind.  The end result is a much more passive game. And passivity is ALWAYS less exciting then fast-paced games.  Additional examples include Yuri's ginormous time-bubble that could engulf a whole team sometimes, Clunks ridiculously long snare, and as I stated before, Scoops Hammer CDT.  As far as succeeding with these nauts post-nerf sure its possible. But in tournament play, there are some characters that will simply never be used because not picking a particular character does not fit the meta.   Below is a thread I found about it, but there are plenty more than this one.  http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=38914"
Awesomenauts,3cs2mw,AvesAkiari,0,Sat Jul 11 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"We've come full circle. It just won't work and it will shake the foundation too much. Of course if everyone was buffed and equally powerful I would love it. But that's never going to happen. Romino usually a single character rework every patch, and that's only ever for the newbies or heavily requested characters. It's pretty much not possible to rework the entire cast where they're all powerful, unique, and equal.   You either buff everyone at once, which would take ages, change the game completely, and spawn landfills of problems. Or buff a character to ""level 30"" and soldier through them being more powerful until everyone else reaches that character's level. Oh boy, all those balance problems. And whose to say that the games will be less passive because now every character can flex their shiny biceps? Romino can influence the meta but not control it completely. Players will find ways to camp, exploit, and take advantage of the meta.  The RPG guys would be a good analogy, if we just pretend RPGS don't have different roles, and are perfectly balanced. That healer is probably a distorted mess instead of a healer if it's equal to a warrior. The reason I love Awesomenauts is how different they play. In the other mainstream Mobas, big portions of the characters share the same generic ability, but with different colors or stats. Each ability is vastly different and as a result harder to balance.  Maybe, if the buffmania was perfect, you would love that, but that's a huge change for other players, including me. The whole meta would change and neither me or you know if it would be for the better. The last thing this needs is an upset portion of the player base willing to leave because their beloved game underwent a massive change.   In short Awesomenauts is not a motherfucking RPG. A cast of 22 wildly different characters, different roles, and different abilities. Yes, it would be awesome if everyone was level 30 instead of level 15, but attempting to do that would cause massive balance changes and outrage. For now, I prefer small nerfs instead of risky meta-breaking changes."

This means to survive early you need to focus on weedlings which is pointless against coordinated teams who can push around them or burst them down safely. That just leaves gnaw with bite upgrades where hes straight up worse than characters like Coco and Leon. I hate the weedling fertilizer mechanic because it forces you to pick between which ability you want to hit enemies, instead of synergizing and both of them dealing damage to opponents."

Played him the other day and holy shit they wrecked him. His seedlings have like two bars indicating fuck you, and honestly you're better off with the splash damage on weedling generation than hoping for them to do anything.

Building good timing awareness is a very useful thing, learn how long it takes for a Naut to go from the start of the solar drop to their base and each turret. This way you can maximise the amount of time you can push/clear for."
Awesomenauts,3cp2ei,Mataric,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"I find the longer distance the naut is, the more time spent looking at the minimap. Rocco, Raelynn, and Coco are basically entirely looking at the minimap for me."
Awesomenauts,3cp2ei,Fancy_Hats,7,Thu Jul 9 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"My opinion, the biggest rift between the average player and legitimately good players is the misunderstanding of the importance of ""pushing"". Even on this message board, it gets pounded into people's heads that pushing is the most important aspect of this game and that ""pushing is the main objective of the game"". But, the reality is that kills, and it's relationship with every element in this game (including pushing), is the most important focus of the game. Kills are the most efficient way of farming. Kills, and the threat of killing is what causes a team to play defensively and what gives you opportunities to push. Kills is what breaks the turtling during late games. Your team and team compositions ability to get kills will dictate how you play the game.  I'm not saying ""pushing"" or clearing lanes aren't important. But, it's how and when you do it that's most important. If a team fight breaks out and your teammate gets kill because you are too busy clearing lanes, then you could be at fault. Let's take it a step further. If a team fight breaks out, and your teammate dies because your abilities are on cooldown due to using them to clear lanes, then you could be at fault. These things are still situational (was the teammate overextending, too low on health and sticking around, knew you were on cooldown but initiated anyways, etc.), but the idea is to think more critically of your own actions.  This is why I'd advise newer players, or players looking to better their game to watch twitch streams of good players. IMO, there's still a big difference in game mentality between your average L2 player and the top players. If it was just execution, then you can only play as good as you can play. But, if it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the game, then that's something that can be fixed relatively easily."

I completely agree with this post, and you bring up a really good point with this bit here.  If you're off in farmville and you completely miss the fact that theres a fight going on somewhere else on the map, then thats a missed opportunity, and also something that the other team will continue to take advantage of.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that killing is farming, but you are certainly right, kills are the most important objective and the fastest way to gain solar. Kills, as you say, even determine when you should be pushing.   So yeah, didn't mean to undermine the importance of kills here.  Good advice on the stream. If you can get some coaching from someone you know is good enough to stream, take that up in an instant, newbies."

Also probably be doing them a favor because you wont be feeding the enemy.  I don't understand the mentality of this though as you wont improve or learn much from staying exactly as you are. Getting stomped in a higher league might make something 'tick' with you or teach you a different/better way to play the game (and if it doesn't then enough losses will send you back down a league anyway).

No one here is telling you to play your heart out until you're league 1.   If you've been getting stomped for months (as you put it) then you must be dropping down to L6 at some point - that's just the way the game works. My impression is that your skill level is better than L6 but worse than L5 which will probably mean you stay in this cycle of winning a few and then losing a bunch. Options are to accept that pattern or improve just enough to compete with the other L5s (which should happen naturally if you continue playing). Of course you may then end up in the same cycle only between leagues 4 & 5.

Sorta like religion. The original, actual Sun Wukong story, ""Journey to the West,"" came from, ""Great Tang Records on the Western Regions,"" written by Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk, who made his travels around the same time Buddhism was being introduced to Japan.  Disney's Arabian Nights story (essentially Aladdin) was pieced together from parts of One Thousand and One Nights which is Arabic.

Awesomenauts,3cp5yu,kmolleja,10,Thu Jul 9 17:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think he has two builds in particular that let him bring something to the table that other 'nauts can't do better. Either way, I always start with base abilities.  Sawblade carry - rush Steel Drum and Spare Blade. Works best on Ribbit and Aiguillon with all the hide areas to ambush from, but it's also strong on Sorona, as the middle bouncers make it ideal for divesawing (deploying sawblade at your base so you can hit an extra 525 recall damage). Keyboard + mouse is needed to get the most out of Spare Blade. Bind the second input for saw to scroll up or down and use it when there's an opportunity to overlap hitboxes with an enemy for 1050 off flying damage alone. Bad players won't respect it and get instagibbed, while good ones will have to rely on harass or just stick to teamfights (especially if they're melee). See my videos for the ridiculous damage in action.  Support - rush totem knockback and one source of slow (usually AA). Only good if your teammates have strong early games and can work together (and on maps that aren't Sorona). Even against good players that don't often get ganked, you force them to play much more carefully, helping your team maintain map control and farm up.  I encourage you to experiment thoroughly, though. Skree's great upgrade variety and balance (outside of Barrier Magazine and some useless AA stuff) really warrants it."

What does it accomplish moving it from Right Click? Are you talking about the Recall portion of your saws?   I watched your videos, but you didn't include the actual skills chosen - could you show me those?"
Awesomenauts,3cp5yu,minic78,3,Tue Jul 14 22:57:16 2015 UTC,"Sawblade can be stopped almost immediately after firing it, faster than you can press a button twice. Scroll wheel up/down as a secondary input (I don't use Q/E or whatever anyway, just the mouse) lets you stop it as fast as possible when bumpsawing (overlapping with an enemy), which means a faster recall if needed and more time spent doing stationary damage. Because there's a delay before a stationary blade can be recalled, you don't really have to worry about scrolling too much and recalling by accident. It's useful for Sentry's teleport beacon as well.  Here's my usual build  I rush Spare Blade on Ribbit (makes soloing the solar boss much easier), switch size with lifesteal against heavy DoT/poke or particles if I have a significant solar advantage, and skip Starstorm Statue or regen for pills if the enemy burst is too hard to avoid. It's also best to get some AA damage before working on totem if your team is lacking pushing power."
Awesomenauts,3cp5yu,shortforeskin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, so you can scroll up to fire, and scroll up again to recall? That seems awesome. I think I need more practice moving around the map, as you seem to be super aware of where your saws are at all times. Dragging them behind you to cause ""continuous"" fly-through damage.   Also your totem placement is bonkers good.   For his AA - I think I like attack speed, damage, and slowing effect. Would you consider those the best of the upgrades?  Thanks again for all the help! I mostly main as Penny, so switching to Skree has me playing in a whole different way."
Awesomenauts,3cp5yu,minic78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately the other AA options are quite weak. They just cost too much on an already solar-starved 'naut.  Most veteran Skrees don't bother with Spare Blade, and I wouldn't really argue that they're ""wrong."" It wrecks tanks and melee 'nauts, but Skree already does pretty well against them. No big deal if you decide that it's not your jam."

Just played a couple matches with the build and I find that I'm very weak in the beginning - you're certainly right about the solar-starved.   How do you best farm solar to get you to your mid/late-game power saws?   First match we won but I went something like 1/2, or 2/3. The next game I went 8/3 - much better understanding of totem placement and saw trapping/recalling."
Awesomenauts,3cp5yu,minic78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"Once you're confident with your Spare Blade control, it's a good early game pickup versus most 'nauts. Try getting it as your first upgrade on Ribbit (for the solar boss), or after one stage of Steel Drum on any other map. It makes you less flexible, but the extra damage and cost effectiveness is really nice.  On Sorona, you might want to save the solar and skip totem at first. Personally, I always buy it on drop unless the enemy team has 2+ 'nauts with attacks that pierce totem like Nibbs/Coco/Penny.   Piggy Bank isn't amazing on Skree, but it is worth considering since his slow/lifesteal can help alleviate the downside of skipping boots or regen."

He is especially good at pushing droids and disrupting enemy teamplay. You need to work on using the saw and learn how to make the most of it (using the boomerang effect e.g.).  Start with speed + Steeldrum. Then max Steeldrum. How you proceed from there is dependent on your style and enemy nauts. When there is a Gnaw or harasser like Coco I tend to take regeneration, but often I right away go for Lashes of the Goddess (damage).  This is a base build that I highly recommend. The rest is up to your liking. I don't recommend Piggy Bank, because your char will be the strongest in end game and then you'll miss that skill and in the beginning your blade is already sufficient.   PS: Skree is a very agile char, learn to use that to your advantage. His ability to hover is as well very confusing for enemy players and allows you sudden stops in mid air.  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Skree/1310000100002010310001321000/1-2-2-2-3-17-17-17-18-25-23-23-23-8-13-13-24-24"

Awesomenauts,3ckulh,LordOfTheSquid,2,Thu Jul 9 00:14:35 2015 UTC,I did manage to evade one by jumping when it came into the screen. So it is not so fast that it is not evadable at all.
Awesomenauts,3ckulh,PardonMaiEnglish,5,Thu Jul 9 09:31:32 2015 UTC,"it is not so fast that it is not evadable at all.   Best argument ever. I dodged it once. ;)   Let me explain to you why it isn't always dodge-able. There are multiple situations, that actually happen a lot that the arrow is just a 100% hit.   If you start teleporting, but of course the Rocco starts firing at you, you have the inertia of the teleport and then you have to jump. With coco ball this is easily juked, but with the arrow, it's almost a guaranteed hit.  Characters with a single jump can't evade the arrow once they are in the air and in the trajactory.  If you are looking anywhere else (which people do, for exmaple tabbing to builds) and notice it later then it enters the screen, you are now too late. Every moment becomes a game of dodge-the-arrow, kind of like playing against leon is a game of watch-out-for-leon. Except now it's behind your towers too! Jay! Fun!  This can even happen when you are walking back to the base.  There is no indication of the arrow, you jump up to the base, and shit there's an arrow. Now you can only move right and left. That won't help because the arrow is going straight horizontal. Maybe if you see it coming at the VERY edge of your screen, you can be in time to juke, but mostly, you are just hoping he misses.  It just feels weird to me that you would make the arrow have infinite range and greater speed, while coco ball gets much slower speed and a small range. This, while rocco already only has advantages over coco. Is there any logic behind this? Imagine a coco ball that doesnt stop and goes super fast... Oh wait.  I do really love the rest of the character, the design is awesome! He looks and plays great, but the arrow is just overpowered by design. Just lob it out there in a straight line and you are bound to hit someone, no skill required. Just ask any l1 streamer, i am sure they would be glad to give advice. Slow wolf would be great to ask too. Bedankt voor de coole update en succes met balancing ;)  Edit: a possible easy fix would be to have damage of the arrow decrease depending on distance."

Awesomenauts,3cn1zl,Xpreshion,14,Thu Jul 9 04:31:01 2015 UTC,We try to do a mix. This patch contains a lot of new content AND a lot of fixes and improvements (like the whole series of sound tweaks in this particular patch).
Awesomenauts,3cn1zl,JoostDev,2,Thu Jul 9 08:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see that. I think personally I get more excited about game  improvement, and more wary about the pitfalls of new content bugs/gameplay changes.  That said ""Reloaded"" was one of my favorite patches even though it changes the main gameplay."
Awesomenauts,3cn1zl,coffee_with_Cthulhu,4,Thu Jul 9 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"The main issue with fixing lag is that there's not a real good way to do it, given the peer to peer system. Besides that, I've felt like they've done a decent enough job interspersing new nauts with fixes and improvements. Sure, there's some bugs; what game doesn't have them? I'm just happy they're still patching their three year old game."
Awesomenauts,3cn1zl,whypcisbetter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just happy they're still patching their three year old game.   WoW is 11 years old and still rocking. It's getting more and more common to support games for much longer, especially successful multiplayer games."

All guessing, take it with a grain of salt."
Awesomenauts,3cn1zl,whypcisbetter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"The game itself is still selling with the expansion. While a lot of people get it on sale for almost nothing, I'm guessing most people still buy it full price, since it's not that much anyway.   Developing a new game could maybe bring in more sales, but developing such a game would be much more expensive and stressful than just improving an already finished game at this point. Nauts is pretty much a cashcow for them now, something they can maintain for a long time without sweating much. If they can make the key improvements to it such as smarter matchmaking, less lag and more balance, they could potentially make it much bigger in the future."

Awesomenauts,3cmnud,Early_Grace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:39 2015 UTC,With Endless Quiver you can in theory have infinite Vengeance if you hit enough shots. It's pretty silly. It even fills the bar up if it drops.

Awesomenauts,3cmnud,dialglex,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"So one thing that annoys me is that when Rocco's precision arrow hits you it disappears, which means that if you didn't see it coming then you take damage and never see where it came from. I get that they don't want it to pierce through multiple players, but there should be a way to see it continue through you after contact.  What ends up happening is that you die to an arrow snipe you didn't see coming and you never see the arrow at all. It just looks like a lag kill. Every time I die to a Rocco snipe I rage about lag, then realize it was just his arrow and I can't see it."

He was incredibly weak and couldn't right 1v1 and could even be weak in 3v3 teamfights.  Sure on paper his Dynamite (damage and DoT) somewhere around 840. However that's no difference to pretty much any character: Clunk: 1000 Explode 540 Bite Coco: 670 Ball Penny: 704 Pulse 462 Pounce Vinnie: 980 Spike Dive Froggy G: 790 Dash ??? Tornado etc. etc. etc."
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,Slevens_,7,Thu Jul 9 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"He's fine, he deserves to actually be powerful for once   He was outright broken in the 2.7.1 days, and was a top-tier character for much of 2.x prior to that.   He was incredibly weak and couldn't right 1v1 and could even be weak in 3v3 teamfights.   I haven't played very much post-2.7, but he was always a pusher far more than he was a fighter. In a team-fight, his role was to land his 60(0) burst early, then read the fight carefully so as to bull properly (generally speaking, either to split a weak character off from the enemy team, or to bullpin, or to facilitate a team escape)."
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,bananasandpie,6,Thu Jul 9 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree, he's been a very strong character for a long time now with his extremely short cooldowns and high damage output. I think it's too early to say if he's OP or not though yet, we need to see how the meta game shapes out after the new patch."
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,Digimon_Lover,3,Thu Jul 9 08:26:26 2015 UTC,I agree.  Any naut with his displacement capabilities could hardly be called weak.
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,Keebsy,7,Fri Jul 10 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  He was very weak early game, but late game he was amazing, especially if you are good with him.  They didn't need to change dynamite at all, or speed him up.  All they needed to do was change his AA the way they did, so it's easier for him to farm."
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,ZubbleTheFearless,8,Thu Jul 9 05:59:51 2015 UTC,His late game was incredible. But I disagree on the first part of your statement. Lonestars early game was amazing. He could piggy bank into trynamite and just become an early brawler machine. His low cool down abilities make his early jungle control great and early spam deadly. He falls off after the super early game and remains pretty bad through mid game until late game where he is a beast.
Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,pmj714,3,Thu Jul 9 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"They didn't need to change dynamite at all, or speed him up.   Ronimo doesn't want upgrades that feel mandatory, but trinimite has always been a required upgrade.

Awesomenauts,3cn5x9,Iyashii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"I think a slight reduction to base dynamite damage would make him a more balanced character, but it is not impossible to win against a team that has him if you don't."

Do you think the new team that joins should have less solar and less turrets? That's would be even more unfair. If anything, late joining should be disabled when there is a triple rage quit and multiple turrets down. But then you would have played the rest of the match against bots.

Awesomenauts,3cli5k,shabalabadingdong99,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:51:24 2015 UTC,It's a viable concern and issue with the game that could be adjusted to just give the new people joining in a similar solar amount to the opposing team rather than overloading them with solar.  You don't have to be fanboying the game so hard.
Awesomenauts,3cli5k,rws247,2,Wed Jul 8 22:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is a results of the way bots are given solar. When a bot replaces a ragequitter, the often get bonus solar to offset the fact that this naut is now a bot. When a new player joins, he receives the average of all other nauts' solar. This way, when there's a teamquit and a subsequent rejoin, the enemy team has a lot of solar."

Characters get nerfed to fix problems that a smaller beta community would likely miss.    Being a new character, he's going to seem really good since no one knows how to build and play against him, but it'll only be a matter of days before someone figures out how to counter him. Notably, like always it seems, RBAY Frog should hard counter Rocco since he uses only projectiles, and the lack of an escape makes someone like Skolldir (your main IIRC) have a field day getting kills against him.    I do think that Precision shot will create some really silly and annoying kills, but the same can be said about Coco's ball, Ted's airstrike, SKOLLDIR'S GNOME, Raelynn's Snipe, etc etc etc.    Now say it with me, ""Rocco is good, but he is in no way broken."""

But when I have teammates that follow-up my cocoons I tend to build that early (after maxing out storm drums). Slow on cocoons is so good at securing kills with teamwork.  His AA build is great, but it's definitely not his only viable build. Support/initiator Genji can be just as good as brawler. I do wish they'd add an extra tier to Space-Hippo Manure Incense, though.

Awesomenauts,3cftvg,DMthePerson,2,Fri Jul 10 04:49:21 2015 UTC,"Also aa gnaw can be quite good. Add slow/amplify to spit and you can do some serious damage. I usually build damage, attack speed, and lifesteal, but dot can be good too."
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,DirigibleWolf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:46:26 2015 UTC,AA is crucial on gnaw. Rabbit teeth and Damage over time upgrade allow you to chase and kill almost any naut who is caught in your acid for more than a second or two.
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,MormonsAreBrainwashd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:32 2015 UTC,Skolldir is a beast with AA upgrades.  They also synergize with the attack speed upgrade on throw.
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,Keebsy,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"AA builds are fine on basically every naut. The only one I would really avoid is Scoop since his abilities are just so much better and would support the team much more in the long run. Usually I'll try to pick up DLS by earlyish mid game, and then the AA row is abandoned until everything else is maxed out."

Awesomenauts,3cftvg,HappyGames,3,Tue Jul 7 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"i feel like i got way better with coco once i stopped going for ball damage. (even more so after all the nerfs)  building AA damage instead really lets you push hard if your left alone, and with so many quick getaways you really become annoying."
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,slickmasterizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think of the damage on ball as a bonus, and beef up the bonus later in the game. Primarily I use it for displacement, and blaze to trap enemies inside AA range.   http://nautsbuilder.com/#Coco_Nebulon/1311000120301012200101320200/1-8-4-20-16-16-23-17-23-17-23-26-26-24-24-9-13-9-2-2-2-11-11-11-3  AA can be applied so constantly that the damage you deal far outpaces what you could do by just buying burst when you build it up. This only fails against highly coordinated teams that can consistently land group burst to end you.  Do you grab extra knockback?"

Awesomenauts,3cftvg,slickmasterizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"If you are prestiging, try grabbing lifesteal instead of structure damage on AA for a few games. I find it to be vastly underrated and I fairly consistently sit in league 1 by using a max lifesteal + AA build after buying knock back ball and base blaze."
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,redria7,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's fine, but you have your skills for a reason.  Try figuring out what upgrades are mandatory for your build. There's no reason to get a non-mandatory AA-upgrade, if there is a mandatory one on one of the other skills.  I always get rift damage as the first thing, to clear droids easily. Then I get snipe damage. Then I get ponytail. Simply, getting some damage in different places.  This is mostly because I use all of her skills a lot, so it's only great to have more damage."
Awesomenauts,3cftvg,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"AA builds aren't bad, it's just that other abilities tend to be better with most nauts, or that they're designed to compliment other abilities. A Scoop AA build is good but only if you use it in conjunction with his other skills, even if they are just the base skills. Scoop is too squishy without his bindings, even if they only heal 300."

Awesomenauts,3chrbt,Slevens_,0,Wed Jul 8 00:51:39 2015 UTC,just leave as soon as you enter a match. The match won't be affected too much if you leave so early.
Awesomenauts,3chrbt,AvesAkiari,0,Wed Jul 8 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"This.  If you leave while dropping in, there's really not much room for the other team to take advantage of a short absence (unless your team goes in 2v3, but that's not your fault)."

Awesomenauts,3chrbt,no_gold_edits,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"It's no more your fault than if your team decides to go in 2v3 after you die, or when you return to base for upgrades, or when you are in another lane.  Other players' decisions are their responsibility.  Let's not be so silly as to pretend otherwise."
Awesomenauts,3chrbt,Keebsy,2,Thu Jul 9 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"Let’s not be so silly as to pretend that leaving a game at the beginning just, oh, doesn’t affect your teammates at all."
Awesomenauts,3cgcwm,olivebates,5,Tue Jul 7 18:21:30 2015 UTC,"Which nauts do you play? If you really want to get into League 1, it's easiest if you keep your selection small.   General advice is kind of hard to give, because it needs to address your weaknesses and blind spots and I don't know what they are. I guess if I were to give some general advice, it would be know when to take risks and when to play it safe.   If a team mate is dead; you are 2v3 and the enemy have the lanes, then keep back and don't do things like attack them from the far side of your towers. It will probably go badly and now you'll be 1v3. Conversely, if you have both the lanes then it's okay for one person on your team to be aggressive. If one person dies (often even if two people die) it doesn't matter if you've got both lanes pushed right up against their back towers. They can't regain the lane fast enough to damage yours.  That leads me into a second point. It sometimes seems to me like the average player favours chasing after kills more than they pushing lanes. I often see people kill all the enemy creeps on a lane and then immediately switch to the other one, immediately throwing away the gains they just made. Worse, I often see people all flock onto one lane for no real reason, abandoning the other one needlessly. Don't react to the enemy's positioning, make them react to yours.   Of course, then you find yourself up against a team of three people who are completely in-sync and that all goes out the window."
Awesomenauts,3cgcwm,Modiga,7,Tue Jul 7 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"This is good advice.  More generally, have map awareness: know where every character is at all times.  If there are enemies you can't see on the minimap, would you die if they all tried to kill you RIGHT now?  Thinking like this will help increase your survivability.  Above all, play defensive and smart; avoid dying at all costs.  Required reading: https://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/22q95y/positioning_and_you_a_guide_to_not_dying/"

Analyzing the game gives you ideas on what to do and playing gives you the ability to execute it precisely and quickly.

Awesomenauts,3cgcwm,whypcisbetter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:45 2015 UTC,"Excellent point here about replays: use them!  If you died a lot, analyze why - were you out of position?  Did you just miss a key skill shot?  Did you try to 1v3 near the enemy turret?  Or maybe you got surprised by a Leon + invis Frog on Ribbit, meaning you just need to keep a better eye on the eye and play more defensively."

Awesomenauts,3cgcwm,Kalazor,5,Wed Jul 8 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"Not teir 1, but I can certainly compete with the top players in a good team. Can play pretty much every naut. Some better than others some...just not. But I feel like I have a post that explains the basic skills required to be ""good."" I'll pull that up again, and elaborate on some of the points.   Sorry for the wall of text, but its a complicated game, and I'm a thorough person :P  There are multiple things you need to learn to be considered ""good"" or decent at the game, but I'll try to break it down into 3 simple categories: Building, Reflexes, and Strategy.   Building your Naut  Building refers to your ability to build your naut with upgrades that make logical sense. You will learn how to do this over time, but its essential to read and understand what each upgrade does for your character. You will not be able to play to the best of your ability if you're 60dmg short for taking a range upgrade that you don't need instead.  Building Tips  -Try planning your build before your match at first  -as you get better, you will be able to build to counter enemy builds in the heat of a fight  -It is typically best to maximize damage first, the meta demands it!  -learn which skill you prefer, and designate that skill to be your main damage skill. Some skills have more base damage than others  -learn which skill you can use as a ""secondary"" (this is usually an escape, or ""crowd control"" ability. This skill will be used more for ""utility"" in the beginning of matches)  -learn which skills combo into each other (scoops ""yellow snow cone"" + ""Banner of the triple scoop"" allows for easy engaging or escaping!)  -Learn how much your upgrades cost! this is important to maximize your time on the battlefield. When you see you've collected enough solar, you can then wait for an appropriate time to go back to your base.  Checklist for Building Mastery:  [ ] I know what each upgrade for my naut does  [ ] I know how to maximize my damage (try using the Nautsbuilder to see damage values for builds!)  [ ] I can look at enemy nauts' builds using TAB, and counter their build  [ ] I know how much solar is needed for each upgrade I plan on getting.  Developing Reflexes  Reflexes refers to your ability to act and respond to the game. This is a pretty broad way of referring to mastery of the ""action"" portion of the game. Its about knowing the nauts abilities, anticipating them, and taking countermeasures.  Reflexes Tips  -look at the minimap to see enemy position. I do this once every 30 seconds at least! you always want to know where everyone is. This will help you anticipate enemy attacks.  -Reflexes are the hardest skill to master. It takes patience and trial-and-error learning.  -fastest way to develop your reflexes is to play a random naut for a few matches every time you sit down to play. You should be doing this once you feel comfortable with a single Naut.  -Initiating a fight is a matter of wits: how can you give damage to them without taking any? The best strategy is to ""lure"" the enemy into attacking in a predictable manner, and then responding with a counterattack.  -You can ""Body Block"" enemies from running past you by predicting their jumps. The body block is more effective when playing as heavier nauts.  -Condition your enemies. If you attack in a similar manner several times in succession, you can often catch them off guard by attacking from a different direction, with a different skill, ect...  Checklist for Reflexes Mastery  [ ] I can predict an enemy attack because I know their ability set, and I can tell when they will behave aggressively  [ ] I look at the minimap to see my team and my enemy's position like its second-nature.  [ ] I can trick my enemy into thinking I will attack (This is called Feigning)  Strategy  Strategy refers to your ability to utilize your knowledge of the game to give yourself a tactical advantage. Knowing when to switch lanes, when to go for Solar Boss, when to order an all-out attack, and when to retreat are a few basic strategies. This section includes different phases of the game, and goals for each.  Early Game  -this is usually within the first 5-10 minutes of a match. All nauts are at their weakest, and most predictable. depending on your character you will have different roles in your team composition. You may be Froggy G, in which case it will be your job to provide instant burst damage, surprising opponents and getting an early kill. You may be Swiggins, in which case you will want to trap the weakest enemy for your team to finish off. You may be Scoop, in which case you will want to be soaking up damage, and jumping in the middle of a fight to help your allies escape an early death.  Early game tips  -don't try too hard to get kills. Your primary goal here is to outfarm your enemies. know when you can get a kill and get away cleanly.  -damage is most important early-game. You want to get first-blood, so maximize your damage.  -stay relatively close to your teammates. you never know when the opportunity for a kill will present itself.  -you don't always have to get a kill to outfarm your enemy. Simply scaring your opponents off by out-damaging them will make them return to base, giving you more time to collect solar, and removing them from the fight temporarily.  -do everything you can to stay ahead of your enemy in solar, even collecting the white solar helps.  -killing health creeps to deny them to your opponents is a legitimate strategy. You also get 3 solar for each one!  Mid Game  This is usually about 15 minutes into a match. Nauts are usually halfway into buying their damage items, or done completely. Players begin buying pills at this point, to prolong their time in a fight. you should be able to get most of your kills here if you play smart.  Mid Game Tips  -press TAB to look at how much solar everyone has. If you see a large gap between you and an opponent, you're gonna wanna stay away for a while, till you out-farm them. (large gap = 200-300 or more solar)   Did you know that two teammates can take turns tanking the turret while both players fire at it? this is good for early turret damage. Turret damage is always good as long as it doesn't kill you.   -Learn the ""flow"" of combat. Once an enemy dies, that enemy will probably come back stronger because they will spend their solar if they've been fighting for a while. Try not to get killed by their new upgrades.  -The outcome of a match can usually be predicted at this point. If not, congrats, you're in a very well-matched game! Don't mess up!  -If you are behind, and get a much-needed kill (50 solar for killer, 30 for the rest of the team) it might be better to get an upgrade instead of pushing ahead.  -If you are ahead, and get a kill, you should almost always push harder to take a turret or another kill.  -If you get a triple-kill or ""Wipeout"" you should always continue pushing ahead. Going back to base to upgrade now is a complete waste of time- just know when the enemy will be back...  End game  This is usually after the 20 minute mark. Kills matter a lot more now, because the time players spend dead will be much greater. This means, of course, if a teammate dies you will be down a player for a long time! Mash that 3 key!  End Game Tips  -The outcome of a match is usually inevitable at this point. If the scales aren't tipped to far on either side, there can still be a turn-around.  -Nauts will be doing max-damage, so make sure you've bought some HP upgrades. Upgrading max hp is always a good move. Pills are great against Gnaw, and other DoT builds.  -Use your knowledge of the game, and your superior reflexes to finish the enemy team off!  Strategy Mastery Checklist  [ ] I understand the ebb and flow of a typical match, and know when to attack, when to defend, and when to go back to base.  [ ] I can synergize with my team, because I know their Nauts' move-sets and play-styles well.  Conclusion  There is literally a limitless number of strategies, techniques, and playstyles that encompass ""being a good player"" The above is a very small number of tips and terms that I notice while playing. No list will ever have a complete list of techniques for play. Overall, the best way to learn is to practice against people who are better than you, and emulate them. Getting dominated by a good froggy or ayla? Ask yourself why. What about their build lets them do so much more damage than you? Does their playstyle counter your own? How can you change that? Do you need to use a different naut? A different build?   I'm happy to answer any specific questions you might have.  *If you would like coaching, I am happy to play with anyone, regardless of rank. I'll be the most help for Froggy and Scoop players. hit me up here *"

Awesomenauts,3ce9yv,XiiCubed,11,Tue Jul 7 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty bad.  Tongue is leons most useful basic ability and youre taking it way too late (if you intended that build order). It provides damage, displaces enemies into disfavourable positions and can secure clutch kills that otherwise wouldve escaped.  Stealth on the other hand is not really useful early on since it doesnt really help your offensiveness to kickstart those needed kills. It is more useful to clear droids and push or to give you a huge survivability boost by making your escapes way easier. Its only later on a part of assassinations if youre stacked out on damage and it enables you to get to your targets safely.    (Do NOT sit in stealth to pick someone off and ""secure"" a kill. Most often that is just wasted time by not pushing, clearing droids, poking the enemy and giving your enemy an opportunity to engage on your outnumbered team.)  Imho tongue stretcher is only useful if you also have teammates that could benefit from it and cooperate. For example if you have a clunk who is setting up explodes and you can tongue them back into his reach or raelynnes setting up rifts for you etc. If youre soloqueue and more of a ""loner"" another upgrade will be more useful because youre in their face anyway and will initiate with tongue to get the extra damage and let the cooldown tick down to potentially have it up midfight another time.  Your AA upgrades dont make any sense together. Lifesteal only synergizes with attack speed and attack speed synergizes with everything, but you dont take it. Clover is good for pushing and clearing, backstab is good for assassinations and clearing, lifesteal is for sustain (generally better in clone/pushing builds).

Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Kngrichard,20,Tue Jul 7 11:33:29 2015 UTC,"Lag - Ronimo's already working on the Happy Matchmaking Server Dropping - I agree, drops are dumb but they are inevitable. LoL handles this by not letting any new players join and locking a player to that match until it's finished, whether or not they are actually in game or in lobby. I'm not sure this is a better solution though...  Nerfs/Balance - The ideal balance is not for every character to be equal, but for every character to be viable in competitive. As long as a naut is still viable there's no cause for concern, imo. If a naut is so viable that it's strategical suicide to not pick them, then there's no freedom of choice; as well as the opposite, where a naut is strategical suicide to pick. Ronimo has code that sends them meta data of how often a naut wins/loses against who and with who so they know more than people give them credit for."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Acr1m,11,Mon Jul 6 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Happy Matchmaking isn't going to have any huge effect on the lag given the p2p is the main issue which obviously can't be changed, they are stopping you blocking people so no longer can block the very worst, and the region settings will still be restricted to those promoting getting games as fast as possible over actually following who people want to restrict playing with."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Takley,2,Mon Jul 6 12:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if blocking data has been made publically available, but a large number of players blocking other players would only worsen matchmaking. Given that matchmaking is the biggest complaint, removing the block feature makes sense."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,bananasandpie,3,Mon Jul 6 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"I agree it can be abused by a minority but for the majority it allows people like myself to block the same trio of Australian pre made laggers I see who are nice enough people but just absolutely ruin any game I attempt to play.  When I come across the same lag issue with someone, I'll block them, and then lowers the chance I'll be forced into such a game again which improves my overall quality of games"
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Takley,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:06 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I wonder if Ronimo will implement a blocking system with the new server
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Acr1m,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:59:06 2015 UTC,That is very good news to hear. I accept dropping as part of the matchmaking. I've steamrolled and have been steamrolled far too often. The learning curve is tough. I think all nauts are viable in the lower 75% of players in skill level. It's also good to hear that they're collecting lots of data.
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Pacifistering,11,Mon Jul 6 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"As for balance, I'd like to see Ronimo try the Dota 2 approach. I really like the basic way how Icefrog handles ballance.  Ex.: a character named Batrider is a very strong initiator, once he has his ult at level 6 and a certain item, all bets are off. How do you balance that? Remove his ult? Ice Frog started out by nerfing his base damage, so Batrider struggled more in the laning fase, causing him to take more risks during the laning fase to become the initiating monster he can be. On top of that, the range of his ult was decreased. He's still every bit the initiating beast he was before, he just has to work a lot harder for it.  What I like about this approach is the way the ""direct nerf""(crush his ult) has been avoided, and all nerfs were to make him have a harder time getting to beastmode."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Gregar,5,Mon Jul 6 05:05:21 2015 UTC,And nobody pick Batrider now :)
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,DeViMoRPh,3,Mon Jul 6 09:48:06 2015 UTC,I still do occasionally. He is super situational though.
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,fappydabear,2,Mon Jul 6 10:58:27 2015 UTC,"He's still picked occasionally, but the role of pick-off initiator isn't as prevallent in the meta as it was in the past. Batrider needs a safer lane with little harrassment, which he just doesn't really get. But he's still played(Demon, Bamboe, Funnik) occasionally.  Although I saw the stats for June, and Bat was woefully low on the list..."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Gregar,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:55 2015 UTC,So you are saying a direct nerf is better... go back to league.

Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,DeViMoRPh,7,Mon Jul 6 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I agree with most of this. Instead of new characters and maps, I would prefer they focused on the lag problem and balancing."

Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,TheGoldenFruit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but the new-content-drives-community-size phenomenon has been observable on most multiplayer games across the past decade. Another recent example is TF2, which had a dramatic slowdown in new content over the past two years and has seen a decrease of tens of thousands of players from their average daily player base, after many years of impressive consistency."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,precursormar,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"That may be a point. But also, if they had a more stable game by fixing the terrible lag issues, and the balancing issues. Every game loses players if new content isn't present. But rather then attracting a temporary player base that grows every so often, why no create a larger, semi permanent player base, that plays the game for it's outstanding balancing and solid connection."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,TheGoldenFruit,8,Mon Jul 6 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"If bots were good for all of the characters, I could see a system where any disconnect will cause the bot to take over mid-action, without needing to re-spawn. If they are able to reconnect, then they are shown what the bot is doing for a few seconds of countdown, then take over the bot mid-action. If we had in-game editable build orders, they can follow that too.  Not sure if the other players should be able to see the countdown. It could cause opponents to dive to take advantage of a second of awkwardness."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,dranoel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"I like the spawn in system idea. Say they have 10secs to buy, 10 to spawn in. They have to wait for the bot to get to relative safety though. Then they just replace."

Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,Xpreshion,6,Mon Jul 6 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP: Lag - this heavily screws with reaction time, they can hit you 20 times on their screen before you can ever do anything about it. Someone who is used to playing at 300 ping because he has bad internet will have an upperhand against someone who has good internet and ping and randomly plays against these laggy players. To those people who say ""lag work both ways"" no, no it doesn't. The person with the 3MB internet will be the one tanking the connection for the person who has a 100MB connection.  Dropping - dropping is also a really big issue take this scenario for example: You play against a team that has no DoT damage and you decide to forgo regen to optimize your build for the current game, then the three players on the other team leaves and a Gnaw, Skolldir, and Nibbs joins, wtf am I supposed to do now? This is a terrible part of the game's design. Just add a surrender button or let the game end.  Balance - Hasn't been that big of an issue except that it is rather slower than other games. In awesomenauts you get a new balance patch like every month or two months, while in other mobas things can change on a weekly basis. But thats not that big of a deal."

Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,MormonsAreBrainwashd,2,Mon Jul 6 11:50:54 2015 UTC,I agree with this wholeheartedly. Why would we want to nerf a single naut instead of making everyone else that falls short better? The only reason I can think of is that it requires more work.

Also what if you get an scenario where two people quit leaving it 3 VS 1? I agree that itsa problem, but removing it creates another problem. Rage quitting is a massive problem in awesomenauts and I don't think anything can fix that."
Awesomenauts,3c9fe4,GonicUK,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"Lag can't be helped.  it sucks, but there isn't a lot of people who play this game.  It's doing well, for an indie game.  You're going to get international players, and it's going to make you lag.  The only thing that can fix this is dedicated servers.    Drop ins/outs are even more impossible to fix.  games run short in awesomenauts, and with the low player base, you can't expect any harsher environments.  Even so, I'd take a drop in over a bot any day.  Drop ins aren't even taht big of a deal unless it's a vinnie or rae dropping in.  And characters getting nerfed happens.  Every nerf ronimo has done has been completely legitimate.  At the same time, you ignore buffs.  The common consensus of this game is ""Every character can be OP if you know what you are doing.""  While I disagree, I think the game is very balanced right now, except for 2 characters due to their absurd pushing potential and ability to stop pushing, since pushing wins the game."
Awesomenauts,3cbmk6,godlax,2,Mon Jul 6 17:25:29 2015 UTC,It's not bad. I would generally recommend getting range on fire instead of one of the others. I would also pick up the Regen earlier as it is really really good

Awesomenauts,3cbmk6,Yxesca,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for your input! It's very helpful to hear other people's opinions of what is good or not I think. I don't disagree with anything you're saying but thought maybe I would give you the reasoning behind why I had things differently...I tend to always build AA items that will give me high DPS as on many Nauts I leave those upgrades till last and so will only be buying them late in the game. Therefore people will have high health pools and abilities will have less of an impact with their flat base damage, instead maxing DPS on AA later in the game will give me the best chance at competing at the point in the game where I am likely to be buying them. I also buy boots and pills on every naut and found it interesting that you think they are optional. I can see the synergy in geting skrogchu and necklace with berries but I tend to think of cooldown reductions as pretty worthless as I find fights in this game are usually shorter than most cooldowns.  I don't quite understand your sentence about berries and necklace...do you mean that if i have no stacks of frenzy and then teleport to the orb it will still reduce the cooldown on orb or only on the flame breath after? Finally is eternal flame worth getting or should i get wing prosthetic instead? (I understand they are all situational but which is the ideal scenario) also are there any other viable nibbs builds that should be used in some situations (AA nibbs?) or is this build the standard one?"

I find that people tend to be able to get away from fire breath pretty easily, and most people build with the intention of getting out of fire breath.  Range and DoT makes it so you can, at the very least, poke with it.  A lot of players also burst bomb nibbs when she's breathing, so I try not to use it on nauts, since it' makes her too vulneral.  Most don't expert burst from orb, though, and it's a really good way to harass enemies (who often expect you to fire breath immediately after).  I don't like fury builds, and I put damage onto AA mostly for farming.  Once I get wax candle, I can usually use AA as the main damage component for nibbs.  I also love to use it against all the billions of rae players right before the snipe."

Awesomenauts,3cbkgs,MisguidedWizard,3,Mon Jul 6 19:47:15 2015 UTC,i tend to get throw damage and gnome throw earlier. my logic is that damage is more important than things like boots or healing or range punch early on. Just keep throwing enemies into your teams turrets and hitting stun punches. that alone can carry you to at least league 2 or 3.

Awesomenauts,3cbkgs,barkhound,2,Mon Jul 6 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"Some random tips:   Mix up your punch timings to make them less predictable. In particular, delaying your third punch to mess with the other player's dodge timing is a helpful tactic to practice. Be alert and look for throws when pushing, but also when defending turrets. With a stun punch ready, jump over their attacking droids a second or so before the turret will destroy them to catch some players unaware and toss them back into the turret for an easy kill. Don't underestimate base ability earthquake. The snare upgrade transforms it into a fantastic initiation tool but it's still great for droid clearing, harassing/poking nauts, and for dropping quickly when used in the air (good for surprising enemies from above, escaping, and dodging abilities) without it. Be careful when brawling with nauts that have good vertical mobility in an area with lots of space to move around in. If you're feeling confident you can try to use the first and second punches to whittle down their health, but it's often best to just back off and look for a better opportunity to engage. Hitting enemies directly above him is not one of Skolldir's strengths. Actively look for kills and play slightly more aggressively in the early game. Enemy nauts will have small health bars and very little damage to punish you with when initiating. A throw into a turret or another member of your team will usually be enough to snag some quick, relatively safe kills.   That's most of the important stuff I can think of off the top of my head. Good luck!"

Awesomenauts,3c7z6f,marsh3n,3,Sun Jul 5 19:20:52 2015 UTC,This definitely seems like a cool concept would love to see this grow to get a realistic team ranking system. Would also love to see wiki like pages dedicated to old teams that no longer exist filled up with info about the teams accomplishments and drama from when they did play (Getting this info from asking older community members) and of course current teams. Maybe be even expanding to indivdual top players pages about them and there skills / achievements/ dramas. I dunno I might be getting carried away for ideas but either way love to see this evolve :)

Awesomenauts,3c8075,phl_fc,2,Mon Jul 6 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"You may know this already, but just in case, the damage Sentry's black hole deals by itself is actually not great.  However, in that period where Sentry has his shield activated, any damage you do to him there will cause his next black hole to deal more damage.  If you can avoid dealing damage to him there unless you'll be able to kill him off before he uses the Black Hole, you should be good."

It's also relatively easy to avoid if you don't get too close to Sentry while he's charged, and his charge decreases over time too.  Shift enter is for all chat, whereas simply enter is team chat."
Awesomenauts,3c8075,db452,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:22:35 2015 UTC,It can do more damage than almost any other single hit in the game.  And yeah just don't let him charge up his hole damage. Stop hitting him when he's obviously trying to charge from you so he has a weak crappy hole.

Secondly we know next to nothing about the background of this embodiment of vengeance, who is he after? Why did they kill him? Which character can purge the Wraithlord from existence?   Other than that he has (imo) some of the best lines in the game because I like characters that are dark and evil as well as the effect when he speaks giving each line a chilling feel to it.  Character: If it had to be a character it'd be Clunk.

Making a new naut, sure, that requires making brand new abilities, but a skin doesn't need to make new abilities so much as just having an artist draw a new costume, and possibly new graphical effects for appropriate abilities.  Of course, though, they may be making skins with new voice lines, which would certainly require extra time to write all the lines and get the voice actors back in the studio.  Either way, they are unlocking the vault at a deliberate rate so I'm pretty sure they know what they want to get into the patch eventually."

However, Yuri's sadistic ways and immense intellect could be dangerous left unattended, he'd probably make some hilariously dark, enormous world domination scheme. Plus Sentry's nasty intentions can be masked because he's a master of disguise. Plus he makes Black Holes and can teleport to his beacon from seemingly everywhere, so that's dangerous too."

Awesomenauts,3c3hcu,throwawayboyaces,2,Mon Jul 6 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"You can kill the solar boss at periods of down times in action. Just watch your minimap and make sure no team fights or major pushes will occur while you kill it. All nauts benefit from it, though I guess characters with stronger mid to late game benefit the most.  Most nauts don't have trouble taking it. Though you might have to use your abilities on it if you're soloing it. In that case I'll only take it if my abilities have low cooldowns. For example, clunk can take it by exploding, but I'd rather save explode. So I'll only take it with clunk if I have upgraded missiles and can just aa and bite it. But penny has two abilities with low cooldowns so I'll spend both taking the boss.  I have played with a person who provided very little other than going for bosses and he'd immediately go for them every time they spawned. Don't be that guy. They can be important but focus on the actual game."

Like Derpl, he's got so many characters that counter him and manipulate his limited maneuverability; like how slow he is in the air, how he has to stay in place when he uses his AA, how his jetpacks disabled by most melee AA's, etc. Top players can usually tear apart even the best of Yuris."

Awesomenauts,3c3hcu,xZaggin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"Leon has been left behind, it's so retarded how you can't approach anyone 1v1 with a leon anymore until super late game where you already have a decent build. No one plays him anymore and if they do its just the shitty players who rely on bot spamming.   You can go through the list,he doesn't stand an even match against no one in the list anymore from early game to mid-game and even late game for some. His base build stand absolutely no chance against anyone,  By this I'm talking about Walking speed,Auto attack and tongue, cloak is practically useless early game, best you can do is go in an insane farm mode and try to cash in as much as possible. But in L1/2/3 games that barely happens since there will be battles and you're at a huge disadvantage for your team  I now end up cashing in on piggy just to be on the same level as the other players in the beginning."
Awesomenauts,3c3hcu,Kalazor,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"So true, Leon is a mid/low tier naut just due to how expensive he is. He needs a couple of strategic price buffs. The problem is that everyone hates Leon and a large portion of the player base does not have a good sense of how to fight against invis. Anytime he's balanced, you get hordes of people who think it's their god given right walk around the middle of the map with half health and no support complaining about how OP he is."
Awesomenauts,3c3hcu,xZaggin,2,Fri Jul 10 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why it's taboo to talk about him, because everyone has this image that he's OP, but he counters absolutely no one at this point.   The reason why he's hated is because he can get up to a certain point where he can do an opening damage of 32 and followed by 57 tongue. Yeah, that's hell of a lot of burst but by the time you have the money to even get all these upgrades plus boots. It's further than mid-game and all the characters have already gained a decent amount of extra health(not counting pills) and probably has AA better than you by this point. Speed wise he isn't shit for what is supposedly an assassin character, pretty much anyone can outrun him or block him out."

I've actually resented the games I've won recently as it was clearly someone else carrying the game (as could be seen by the 800 solar difference between that person and me) and that just improves my rank, something I really don't want.

I'm talking about bulling people into turrets, throwing them to your team, or black holing them, or even tongueing them in the right direction, all can set up a kill and help you big time. CC is your friend. Remember that body blocking is also one of the best CCs in the game.   One more thing. When you see an ally being chased by a Scree on the map, run and help him! He is likely being slowed and getting drained to death. But Scree himself is probably wounded, so when you can reach them in time, you can most likely save your ally, and secure a kill on that Scree. Think about how valuable one little decision like that can be. The minimap is your eyes and ears."

I just had a few (20-25) bad games a two weeks ago where I lost almost every game due to teammates that were significantly worse than me and my opponents. In most cases, I was 6-0 or better, because I was also better than my opponents, but my teammates were SO MUCH WORSE that no matter how well I did, it made no difference and we lost anyway. I dropped from League 2 to League 5 in those few days. I'm currently in League 3, winning MOST (but not all) of my games because I can usually stomp most people in pub games, especially when I'm playing an easy naut like Coco or Penny or Nibbs."

Awesomenauts,3c3cfd,skavoc,3,Sat Jul 4 10:41:32 2015 UTC,"At the end of a match you should get: 1) Solar/EXP for finishing a match 2) Solar/EXP for winning if you won 3) Solar/EXP for what you earned in the game IIRC number 3 should be based on solar gained in the match, so kills will attribute towards this. Generally speaking, if you want to gain levels quickly just to get the achievements out of the way, bot matches are the fastest way to level up because you can get easy wins and easy kills. If you quickly knock out a bot game with easy bots, you'll be able to see the balance between the different solar amounts given."
Awesomenauts,3c3cfd,Handsomeglasses,2,Sat Jul 4 11:08:37 2015 UTC,"So a bot match on easiest with, say, 15 kills will give more than an online match with, say, 10 kills? Difficulty doesn't matter?"

Awesomenauts,3bwuwp,Acr1m,3,Thu Jul 2 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"Engage with your team. When playing against him, and you are alone and you get busted down and killed quickly, that is because that froggy is used to the character and knows what he can and cannot take without dying. Using your burst with another naut or a teammate in the early game while farming will get you the money you need to be comfortable in your build. When I'm not froggy, and against one, most of my kills come from a lonely roaming froggy who thinks his burst is broken and thinks he is invincible. If you do chase, make sure you are familiar with where everyone is at on the mini map, because if you waste your burst getting that kill, you are a big no-hp target. If I am not froggy, and I see a teammate being chased by froggy, I head that way because I know they probably blew their burst early and I don't need much dmg output to finish them off. Not really a build suggestion, but I hope this helps some"

Struggling with DoT, 1 stage of regen after hammerpants. VERY rarely I will get pills before I finish everything else.    Another big tip, master the triangle dash. It's extremely important for fast and powerful initiations. If you don't know what triangle dashing is, it's where you jump then dash at a diagonal angle so you collide with the floor and your opponent, at max damage splash dash that's a massive chunk of even a tanky enemy's health bar.    Also be aware that going in with dash isn't always the best idea, if you're facing a team filled with stuns, slows, and knockback you should save your dash for when you absolutely need to get out.

Play him as an engagement and chaser, not as a brawler. He is utilized to either setup or pickup, he isn't catered to brawl until practically max build."
Awesomenauts,3bwuwp,rightoversoup,2,Thu Jul 2 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"It may seem obvious, but pick rbay if you are fighting a comp which is countered by it (e.g. derpl, lone, scoop). I'm also in the minority who also likes duration as it allows me to cheese turrents and snag surprise reflect kills. Normally though speed, tweeters, and shield are sufficient."
Awesomenauts,3bwuwp,ZubbleTheFearless,2,Thu Jul 2 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"With froggy, you gotta practice with dash.  Dash is easy to land, and easy to miss.  Keep in mind one thing when playing froggy:  EVERYONE HATES YOU.  You are a constant annoyance to every naut you fight, and they'll see red and charge for you consistently.  So position your dash so that after the dash is complete, you can escape, because everyone wants to punish you for dashing.  Your build won't matter, honestly.  Every upgrade with froggy is useful.  You just gotta build to avoid getting trapped by enemies.  On dash, I usually take damage and cooldown reduction.  If you are new to froggy, stacking cooldown reduction will always give you a good way to escape if you find yourself in a stupid place.  Slow is great if you have a slow ally (like clunk or skoldir) as it'll help them land their skills.  Ground pound is amazing, but it's a high skill ceiling, and it's easy to dodge even though people tend to not realize all they need to do is get off the ground when you come at them from above.  With tornado, RBAY is situational (even though everyone says it's OP).  It's ok to help tank towers, but thats a waste of a good skill.  It's great against derpl and lonestar, but honestly, RBAY is a clutch in my opinion.  It's a high risk move, so while getting use to froggy, shield is better than RBAY.  Shield makes it so you won't need pills with froggy, but always wait for enemies to use their burst before you use your tornado.  A tornado'd froggy is an easy target, and everyone sees that as an easy time to punish you for picking froggy.  I pick it early to farm more than anything, but once you get good with using it, pick damage and tweeters.  Gun froggy is underestimated.  Range, damage and attack speed are great, and no one seems to realize that they are being poked by froggy.  Keep dash to escape if you do this.  Want even more damage, and think you are good enough to be even closer?  Double shot +dmg +att speed is also great.  Just know when to dash to safety, and avoid snares.  It's also a good hit and run maneuver if you take AA damage, split shot, and extra damage after dash/tornado.  Dash in, shoot, and harass from a distance while you weakened the enemy into needing to run.  Regen is a must for froggy.  Get it early, along with boots.  I like BKM more than pills, but pills is a good safety net for froggy in general.  Since slow/snare/silence will completely end your escape plans, I like BKM, especially against characters with consistent slows (skree, coco, soon to be Rocco)."

Awesomenauts,3bwuwp,robochase6000,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"slow on dash can be very helpful if your team can capitalize on it.  i'm not pro (league 4 to 2, depending on soloqueue luck heh), but i find playing with piercing, thornfish, and range (bought in that order) is really fun. also imo, this is the only way to build AA against certain team comps, especially if they're bunching up and your team is having a hard time splitting them up. plus it definitely helps against turrets when your team is dominating mid, but can't quite get your droids close enough to safely tornado (usually due to strong turtling teams). plus the three-pronged long range piercing gun just looks awesome.  other than that and what's already been said, keep practicing your jump with and without boots.  i've found that there's a good amount of jumps he can make that aren't immediately obvious. finding them will give you more mobility options, allow you to traverse the map faster, etc."

Let him hold a lane; it's easy for Gnaw with his weedlings. This frees up the other two to push the other lane. The enemy will either beef that lane and let Gnaw push, or scrape by defending both.  Let Gnaw get droids. Without droids Gnaw can't build parts for weedlings. A Gnaw with no weedlings loses a lot of momentum.  Gnaw doesn't have much for escaping besides some slight speed boosts and slow on spit. A good Gnaw will try to stay out of brawls, so try to keep him alive. Dead Gnaw means no weeds.  The biggest threats Gnaw uses is his DoT to finish/scare off enemies and weeds to let droids push even without a Naut to help push. Gnaw needs parts for weeds and he can't stay in a fight too long because DoT takes time."
Awesomenauts,3btiwz,Iyashii,6,Thu Jul 2 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"The trick is to let Gnaw support you.  If you want to pick a good Naut to help Gnaw out, try a Naut that doesn't move around a whole lot, like Derpl. Gnaw can put weedlings around you to support your firepower. Alternatively, you can pick a Naut that's good at chasing so you can make the most of the CC Gnaw has on his spit.  If you're a fast brawler or assassin, try to stay close to Gnaw (but not too close, so you can help each other out if one of you gets in a bad situation). Gnaw has two upgrades that give him speed, so he can be very good at getting in, doing damage, CC'ing the enemy team, and getting out. That's your cue to finish them off (and if you can't kill them, the DoT just might)."
Awesomenauts,3btiwz,gmfk07,3,Thu Jul 2 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"You could always have him support you. With the DoT he is dealing nearly at all times, he's great for weakening enemies.

Awesomenauts,3btiwz,MisguidedWizard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"A good Gnaw player will nearly always land enough DoT on a character to make them disengage from a fight, you can help that process by dealing that character enough damage to put them in a position where they may die to the DoT or just finish them off outright. Gnaw's spit has incredible burst potential on lower health characters and utilities like slow on spit can make those finishes much easier to obtain."

Awesomenauts,3buit2,Newtzor,3,Thu Jul 2 06:58:05 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you're on a laptop. Do you have it on high performance?  Are you using DX or opengl? Have you adjusted your graphics to low ?   Did you try connect via ethernet?  Did you verify game integrity/cache?
Awesomenauts,3buit2,Eternal_Atom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:10:41 2015 UTC,"On a laptop indeed. I've messed around with the different performance settings and low seems to make a slight difference only with the initial load time. Using DX + multithreading (both recommended settings), connected on Ethernet, and I've verified the integrity/cache.  Like I said, this hasn't been a problem until this most recent patch; I've been playing on this laptop for 2 years now without issue. Gonna try defragging my HDD and see if that makes a difference!"

Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Gumbink,3,Wed Jul 1 19:24:38 2015 UTC,Voltar's farming has been lackluster since they removed his solar gain from healing. He's probably the worst at farming in the game right now.
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Kalazor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"But he doesnt need to farm, just like most other nauts. He is a pretty capable teammember that can pull his weight himself since the new patch."

Awesomenauts,3brmvl,rightoversoup,2,Wed Jul 1 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're still right though, it is pretty excessive. If they want to give him 600 damage trinamite again then the least they should do is knock up the price of dynamite damage from 130 per stage imo."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,DMthePerson,4,Wed Jul 1 17:03:36 2015 UTC,For Loney to hit max damage on dynamite he needs to have all upgrades on damage and have all three sticks hit. Compared to how much other Nauts can do with a single ability it's not that huge of a buff. Other high damage abilities aren't normally limited by multiple projectiles.  EDIT: Also Loney is expensive to upgrade and that's always been a counter to what he can do.
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Iyashii,6,Wed Jul 1 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"those lonestar buffs are insane. let's see if hey're not a bit much.  also i don't know if scoop can really do that much with this increased hammer cooldown. i think hammer might be too weak without CD now (7,5 seconds holy shit), while it is underwhelming even with the cooldown upgrade (6,5 seconds is barely lower than the current unupgraded hammer)."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Tanzklaue,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"I hate nerfs like these because they usually just make people want to build the nerfed property even more than before.  Honestly though, his hammer was really annoying."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,DMthePerson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they should just leave hammer with it's base cooldown, but remove the cooldown reduction upgrade, replace it with something else."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,ZubbleTheFearless,0,Thu Jul 2 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"They really shouldn't have nerfed the cooldown upgrade since it feels somewhat less appealing now to me, but I can understand increasing base cooldown."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,KEEVAN1234,3,Wed Jul 1 17:35:34 2015 UTC,New lone star is looking to be s tier again.  Movement speed was always one of his drawbacks and they buffed it  90 damage trinamite with an ability to lower cd Slight AA buff  Overkill. Welcome back to the push meta boys

Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Kalazor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:05:27 2015 UTC,It is the time-to-wait reduction that will make Eyedrops way better (too good?).  Also on the topic of Voltar:    Attackspeed is still only meh. Damage upgrades are even worse on healbot because of the health nerf The Weaponized Hull price buff was pretty unnecessary.
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,irrzir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when you reduce it to 2s it's much more usable. Might even make Euphoric Thoughts good since that's now a 630 heal over 10s.  Ronimo reduced the price of almost every item by 20, so Weaponized Hull actually got one of the smaller buffs. Warpgate Overdrive and Drone army are both 20 solar cheaper. Voltar will scale much better in this beta."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,Kalazor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Most of the stuff looks good, but I think that Cocoon interaction with Vengeance is too much. Vengeance has a cool down of 20 seconds, just being able to cancel it like that makes it so much weaker."
Awesomenauts,3brmvl,HollrHollrGetCholera,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:38:09 2015 UTC,Rocco has the option of firing from outside of Cocoon range though. It may just mean that you need to buy range against Genji.

But pretty much every night my friends and I get put against absolute pros who wipe our team within five minutes. We're not total shit, just can't match up to people on top prestige/league 2 etc. We quit until we find a good matchup because to be honest I only have time for one or two games between getting home and eating and I can't be bothered with being steamrolled. It's really spoiling the game a lot."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,dougie_g,4,Wed Jul 1 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this has been my experience, too.  Always matched against full-prestige (hence very experienced) players who have ungodly coordination and taunt constantly.  It's one thing if they're just good at the game and offer friendly advice, but it's the toxicity that spoils it for me."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,Keebsy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The worst thing is that I've come across a team like that playing in league 6, all wearing those dev badges, not sure if they were team or interns or what. All un-prestiged, but just completely steamrolled us with taunts all over the place. I should have recorded it, was a really shitty experience.   Someone with the dev flair also once told my mate to fuck off when he asked why they were playing in league 6 and destroying him.   So I don't know if it is a problem that will be fixed soon. The devs overall strike me as good types so not sure what happened there."

Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,tonyantonio,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"I can't help but to think that a solution to the problem would be to introduce a normal mode for less competitive people. Although, dividing the player base in such a way might hurt the game considering its size."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,dougie_g,2,Wed Jul 1 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"You would also have the problem of people playing in the casual league just to destroy people. Annoyingly, some people just get their kicks from ploughing less committed players. Personally my favourite matches are the ones that are super close, and I don't care at all whether I win or lose. Don't know how you can build that into the game though."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,ACompetitiveHalo,2,Wed Jul 1 22:50:18 2015 UTC,"OP, it's a playerbase issue. No amount of happy matchmaking servers or league resets will fight the fact that this game has an incredibly small playerbase, 10s of thousands smaller than what it used to be (100s of thousands if you count season 0). There are rarely more than 1000 players on at any point in time according to Steam Charts, and there are only 50K people on the leaderboards. That's a really small playerbase. Unfortunately, that means matches will be much less a test of skill and much more a test of luck. Will your teammates suck? Will the enemy RQ and get replaced by people who DON'T suck? Will you reconnect out of the game for reasons you can't control like bad hosts? These issues have technically plagued Nauts forever, but it's decreasing playerbase size really exacerbates those issues. Unfortunately, I think these issues you mentioned will continue to persist until the game dies, simply because the game will never return to it's 150K+ player roots with 3-5K on at a time. Joost has a blog post (one of the few I actually agree with) that explains why such a small playerbase makes these issues you described prevalent."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,_Ketchup,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:13:59 2015 UTC,"It's an unfortunate problem with nauts. It's mainly due to the player base. Also if you queue up in a premade, matchmaking is more likely to match you with another premade, which in turn is more likely to be high league players.   All I could suggest would be to solo- q, or set your matchmaking settings to world wide, this would increase the player base but obviously games could be laggy."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,ACompetitiveHalo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"I actually have the opposite issue. I find if I premade, I stomp, and if I solo, a guaranteed 75% or more of my matches will be losses. :D As for soloing with worldwide on causing lag, I already get lag/laggy players at least once per match with standard settings anyway, so I don't think it could get any worse... ::laughing/crying::"
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,ACompetitiveHalo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This has literally been every single one of my games today. Every single loss I've had today was never because I or we were clearly outmatched, but because WE clearly outmatched the other team and the RQers were replaced by people who were much better suited for the situation... Or, I get into a match and have dougie's problem, where I go against people who are absolutely amazing right of the bat, with teammates who are just brain-dead... OMFG! Seriously, like 5 losses in a row because of that shit! Just played a game where I went 8/1 as leon and pushed both top turrets, but we lost because a RQ clunk fed and bitched. I didn't have these problems 2 seasons ago, or even 1 season ago!  This game is just going downhill so damn fast.  I'm sorry, ronimo-worshippers will tell you otherwise, but it is. Happy matchmaking server? They've been talking about it for like 6 months... where the hell is it? Seriously, if this game doesn't pick itself up and become more fair soon, it can lose me as a player."

Keep in mind that others become frustrated, too, which can lead to poor decisions and accidental ""feeding"" - these situations are often unintentional."
Awesomenauts,3bsqyp,ACompetitiveHalo,2,Thu Jul 2 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"Add to my arsenal yet ANOTHER completely bullcrap game! Was winning by a marginal amount, almost equal but slightly in our favor, an enemy rage quit, a bit later, a latejoin Ayla comes in, wrecks, and completely turns the game around from 'Us: Full Turrets, Them, 2 Turrets' to 'Us: Loss'. Not to mention, she was also a gloater, which pisses me off even more... What the actual, real, hell Ronimo? It pisses me off to no end that this is not just possible, but practically standard for matches. Why can't a loss just be a freaking loss anymore!?

If you're going to be so cocky as to taunt, then you should make yourself vulnerable somehow while doing it.  Smash Brothers, for example, is a game that got this right.  At the very least, this should happen every, say, 3 taunts - just something to prevent spam and introduce a little risk.  Otherwise, it's literally just an annoying voiceover, with no show of superiority.  Just seems strange to be able to hurl insults on demand with no drawback."

Awesomenauts,3bs43t,_Ketchup,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:59:33 2015 UTC,"Hello  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Leon_Chameleon/1302010120011010222001301010/27-25-8-1-19-19-18-18-17-17-4-4-9-6-9-2-2-2-23-23-23-12-13  Being invis is almost useless until you buy Surprise Party Mask, but still buy it for escaping reasons.  The best strategy for Leon is to just be annoying, kill lots of droids, silence tongue many people and just all around stab people until they bleed (or if they are dead).  I'm not too good at explaining things from what I do so you should probably take someone else's advice."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Yxesca,3,Thu Jul 2 05:50:36 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is how big the map is. If anything ronimo are aware players don't like big maps as they shrunk Sorona a bit so maybe they will do the same.  A major problem is how far away the HP is. If your team (which they will since they're pubs) use them when they're 1 bar down its gonna be hard pickings getting any in the neutral area.   Another problem is how some nauts dominate that neutral area. Gnaw for example can go uncontested if you let him up there.  Then the fire, so many things that bother me about this. IMHO its too frequent still. It also makes it impossible to escape if the enemy gets behind you while pushing. Guaranteed kills. There's also navigating the jump pads getting up if you miss one you look like a moron and fall all the way down.  With the lack of hidden areas Yuri can't lure people into anywhere, and they changed it from 404 where he could simply deny with bombs.   Long ranged nauts have the upper hand too since there's simply nowhere to go to dodge an attack anyone with a remote amount of skill will so very easily snipe you. I can only imagine how bad it will be with Rocco?  To a certain extent the buzz droids are useless and just give out free solar.  What people hated about 404 with certain nauts having a clear advantage was never properly fixed, they simply changed the problems at hand.   I'm not saying they did a bad job, nor am I saying its easy to design a map but damn 205 is a salt generator."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Eternal_Atom,0,Thu Jul 2 06:54:47 2015 UTC,"I like 205. The fire issues and navigation are skill based, so that's not really a problem. It does force a change in play style depending on who you're against, but so does every map."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Handsomeglasses,2,Thu Jul 2 10:09:14 2015 UTC,"the concept and mid area of the map aren't the problem, it's just the size... They realized it with Sorona, so hopefully they'll bring this stage down in size as well..."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Acr1m,3,Thu Jul 2 11:21:44 2015 UTC,I see the lack of platforming as a detriment to skillful play because it puts a heavier emphasis on innate movement values. That's a completely unnecessary strain on slow nauts with no such equivalent for fast nauts.
Awesomenauts,3budbx,irrzir,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"Part of the balance of games is to have movement, powers and utilities offset each other. If you can't play a slow character to the terrain/surroundings, then wouldn't that be the player's fault, not the map's or the naut's? Whether it's open space or hidden areas or multiple platforms, there are ways to adapt a characters playstyle."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Handsomeglasses,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, that's a bit of a stretch.  This game does not have an endless skill ceiling, there does come a point where slow nauts (and nauts without a sustain or Lifesteal ability) are straight-up worse than those with speed because they lack the options that those nauts have.  Your options are within the same vein as somebody with a broken leg - obviously you have ways to adapt, but you'd rather not have the broken leg and running will be kind of a pain in the ass.   There is no upside for tanks besides the ones that already exist on the other maps. That is a lack of balance and something that cannot be pinned on the player.    Obviously other maps have similar issues, but none as broad as this and usually the effect is enabling rather than disabling (for instance, Ted McPain turns into S tier on Ribbit IV)."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,irrzir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:39:14 2015 UTC,But tanks can do cheesy drop kills through the fire for dayz :D
Awesomenauts,3budbx,boydorn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"Comparing slower nauts to a person with a broken leg. yeah, I'm stretching. It's seriously nowhere near as much of an issue as you make out, that's my opinion though so I'll just leave it there."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:34:12 2015 UTC,"That's a completely unnecessary strain on slow nauts with no such equivalent for fast nauts.   Except that you can capitalize on that with slow nauts.  Doing drop bombs through the fire using Clunk Explode, Derpl Nuke, Sentry Hole (charging it up with the fire) catches the other team off guard cause they're not expecting people to drop through the fire... You can wipe out an entire team in those cases."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Daemonicus,3,Fri Jul 3 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"You can do the same thing on Sorona? Ribbit and Aiguillion give you all the hiding spots, so there is little special about surprises on 205 other than that you damage yourself along the way."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,irrzir,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:32:33 2015 UTC,"Which supports my point. And for you to so easily dismiss the surprise as being ""little"" is a tad ridiculous. It's a big surprise because it's even less expected on the map.  It's not an unnecessary strain on slow nauts. And it adds variety to the maps. It's useful for a different style of play, and you can create traps with it."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Daemonicus,3,Fri Jul 3 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"They are little, for the following reasons:   In higher leagues, it's not uncommon to keep an eye on the minimap every 3-5 seconds. On 205, your teammates and even your droids can scout out the top lane for you. On Ribbit and Aiguillon, this doesn't happen, as hiding spots conceal your spot on the minimap.  That is the ONLY surprise you can have on that map, so in L1 it is not a surprise but rather an expectance.  Once the first two turrets are down, this one and only expectable surprise takes a backseat to people that can make it to the enemy turrets quicker. Mid becomes less of a battlefield and more of a very long trek to the actual battlefields."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,irrzir,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"I'd agree to a certain extent that its skill based. But it loops back to certain nauts have the advantage. If the fire is on 90% of the time you will take damage from a long ranged nauts or damage from dodging their attack, there's no ""skill"" in shooting fish in a barrel."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Eternal_Atom,3,Thu Jul 2 12:24:38 2015 UTC,There's a skill to not stand in the barrel.
Awesomenauts,3budbx,Handsomeglasses,3,Thu Jul 2 14:39:16 2015 UTC,No a lot of people agree with you. There is a reason it is banned in most tournaments (including awesomecup).
Awesomenauts,3budbx,bigbobxc,2,Thu Jul 2 07:28:46 2015 UTC,"205 is absolute crap and Ronimo should have just reworked 404. like, put a lane where the jungle is/was and move the jungle up OR widen the mid and put small jungles there (make them indents, sort of like the Jgs on Aiguillon)"

Awesomenauts,3budbx,Keebsy,3,Thu Jul 2 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think he was referring to the randomness of map selection. But yeah, everyone has to deal with the map, it's not just affecting you."
Awesomenauts,3budbx,boydorn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"It certainly favours some characters over others, unfortunately. Playing a tank on AI 205 is a pain in the ass thanks to its size and FUCKING hummingbird droids. But I personally prefer that over a chokepoint. I wouldn't mind if they made it smaller and added one more healthpack spawn per team, I think that would improve the map. Remember though that the opponents suffer the same disadvantages that you do though so it kind of evens out (unless they have voltar of course, he shines on that map)."

Awesomenauts,3bpvde,DMthePerson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:52:21 2015 UTC,Damage and attack speed let you set up pockets of mines that can instantly kill almost any naut with a well time black hole. You can plant mines in front of turrets  or other choke points to zone out enemy Nauts or get an easy kill.
Awesomenauts,3bpvde,DMthePerson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, figured that'd be the optimal build with duration. I'd always use lifesteal myself, combined with the attack speed boost on teleport. Haven't played Sentry in a while though so not sure if it's still that decent of a build at all."
Awesomenauts,3bpvde,Collectors_Edition,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:15 2015 UTC,I feel like lifesteal is overrated on Sentry. I always buy Med'i'can first and use the beacon to teleport in and out of battle quickly for a more substantial heal. I guess the only time lifesteal is better is if there is another Sentry on the other team that can abuse the duration on your mines for his own black hole.
Awesomenauts,3bsqf4,wlholt91,3,Wed Jul 1 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Voltar is completely different; his healing wave is single target now but also innately deals damage (choose between heals or damage). Healbot deals a single healing pulse after a cooldown. Drones shoot lasers and explode one at a time.  All the starstorm 'nauts are out now. There's a glass cannon (nibbs), a tank/infiltrator/lotsofwaystoplay (sentry) a rastafarian techno-shaman (skree) and some others I don't care about. Jk, the others are good but not my style.  There's also a new character, Scoop, who is kind of a lightweight clunk.  Balance wise, the old nauts are pretty much the same, but there have been tweaks to most characters. Derpl is harder to use than ever but turret upgrades are much cheaper.  Matchmaking is still a bit shaky, but theyre going to overhaul the system HOPEFULLY with the release of the next patch or soon after.  Oh, and baby kuri mammoth (CC reduction upgrade) has been buffed to a point where it can be useful!  Welcome back!"

For one you are not so frustrated and can jump in a better game, for the other your rank is quickly decreased so that you meet more players on your level. Another point is that if your team consists of better players than you they'll be grateful because they have the chance to get a better player.  You may use those games though to see how better players play and learn some tricks.  Eventually when your skill level rises you find yourself less frustrated and slowly working your way up the ranking.  PS: The start in this game is really hard."

Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Handsomeglasses,6,Tue Jun 30 06:53:48 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference in general playstyles between leagues 5-7 and 3-4. As you develop through the ranks, you'll start seeing better teamwork and better individual skill from players, and there are some big hurdles for most players to jump over before they can feel comfortable playing. My advice wouldn't be to stay comfortable in lower leagues and avoid games, it would be to endure tough games and develop, learn how to play safely while still having an impact. I had a really tough time around your area a year ago, and now I'm a solid mid-league 2.    Another thing is characters. The best way to develop is to find the naut that you're most comfortable with and hammer them, so you're getting good as one character while you get better at the game as a whole. Then, you can transfer that game knowledge to other nauts later and learn how to play them. Hope this helps."

Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,santoscrew,2,Tue Jun 30 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, try not to get mad when you die. Sometimes it's entirely your fault, and sometimes the other player just made a really good play.  Rae's Snipes can be really annoying, but a mid air Snipe from a jump pad is skill, not luck. Saying 'nice shot' afterwards lessens the attitude of annoyance.   At the higher leagues, team work is expected, and when a team travels around together, you need to do the same."

Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Virreinatos,3,Tue Jun 30 06:52:51 2015 UTC,"I wrote a guide call Positioning and You: A Guide to Not Dying that goes over the basics of the game. It's useful for new and experienced players. Read through that to get an idea about what good play looks like, then use that knowledge to reflect on your play every time you die. When you start to understand what's causing you to die and making improvements based on that, that's when you're going to start getting better at the game.  If you find yourself blaming lag, premades, OP nauts, UP nauts, or shitty teammates, then you're just taking control away from yourself. There's always something you can do better, even when all those other factors are stacked against you.  Also remember, when you start to get matched against league 2 and 1 players, you're playing against people who have dedicated considerable hours to this little indie game and the difficulty curve will rise sharply. If you can manage not to get discouraged, you can learn and improve much faster from losses against those good players than you would from wins against easier ones."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,mullersmutt,2,Tue Jun 30 18:00:15 2015 UTC,I was about to search for this! Yes. Read this guide. It should be mandatory reading for all newbies.

Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,mullersmutt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"I was also going to search for this as a first recommendation.  In general, if you're dying too much, use more defensive positioning.  Personally, I don't go past mid until I have a feel for the teams' relative skill levels and the upgrades I deem necessary for good escapes."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Keebsy,2,Thu Jul 2 04:53:14 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem. Won some games early over what I assume was being carried by experienced players. It seems I'm placed at a rank above my skill level and get slaughtered too fast to enjoy it or learn how to do better.   The one thing I am learning is how not to get killed, but that just involved running forward and running away with minimum team contribution. There's not enough time to learn skills yet."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Kalazor,15,Tue Jun 30 03:33:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this will help, but depending on team comp and enemy team comp, a huge part of the game sometimes IS playing a slow, boring defensive-minded back and forth.  The first thing I tell new players, and the thing I have to remind MYSELF of every time I play, is that dying is the WORST thing you can do in Awesomenauts.  You simply have to play defensively, play smart, and only get overly aggressive when your enemy makes a mistake first and you can capitalize.  Solo-queue could be another issue.  Once you are good enough to outperform most of your bad team and rise in the ranks, you come across ranks where people are largely duo- or triple-queuing, and as I have always said, Teamwork is the most ridiculously OP skill in the game.  Most times, if you find yourself solo-queuing and your comp has NO chance to win... Well, chances are, with a bit of teamwork and communication, that wouldn't be the case."

You can fix it with enough discipline, but if you're just here to have fun that's an awful lot of work to put in. It's hard to get people to train themselves to be more patient.

Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,mullersmutt,2,Wed Jul 1 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"What's helped me in the past has been to lane-hop.  Stay in safe areas, but move around the map more.  This gives you a better picture of the match and constantly leaves you with something to do.  Of course, some nauts can also help clear both lanes simultaneously, so this is often the best thing you can do anyway."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Smooth_One,-1,Thu Jul 2 04:58:05 2015 UTC,"See, this is a problem Ronimo hasn't attended since after Ayla and Humble Bundle came out... The game has just become this play the most cheesy comp or cheesy combos but staying safe or picking FotM (flavor of the months... the Pennys, the Aylas right now, etc). The game was supposed to be a fast-paced casual MOBA that has gone to a slow passive paced boring game.   You shouldn't promote passive play that much (assist money) in order to have what ronimo intended the game to be.I don't know how many MOBA players actually like to wait for 20 mins, ""farm"" (which in Nauts is almost useless as nipples in a man {thanks Cyanide}) and then try to pull off a ""combo"".   Let's see if with the addition of this new ADC style of char they improve farming system and give some other mechanics so the game actually can keep moving forward.   And to mullers, i can come up with 5 things worse than dying in Awesomenauts: Have lag or your enemy team has lag (most of the time lag will not be on your side, giving the other enemy the advantage), Reconnect deaths (although it's also dying :S), force starts, late joins and disconnections. Oh and don't forget the rank discrepancies that Ronimo erased from the TAB menu so we wouldn't notice."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Capt-FuzZebra,14,Tue Jun 30 07:10:25 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with the majority of your post.  This game's meta is in a constant state of flux, like every other competitive game. There will always be ""flavor of the month"" Nauts, because balance will never be perfect. That's just the nature of the beast.  The game may be ""meant"" to be a fast-paced MOBA, but that is completely irrelevant to what it actually is. This is an easy example, but look at Super Smash Bros. Melee. That game was supposed to be a party game, but look at it now. It continues to develop its meta (without patches, which doesn't matter in this context but is neat), 14 years later. Designer intention doesn't mean squat in-game.  If you want to play competitively, you need to play smart. Looking at this logically, in Awesomenauts, playing smart necessitates farming well so you can become more powerful. Dying gives your opponent farm (on top of taking away map pressure), so this is detrimental.   If you can play super aggro and get more kills than deaths, good on you, but this generally isn't good advice for new players (which was the entire point of mullersmutt's post) because their opponents will likely be more skilled in combat than they are due to their advanced game knowledge.  Playing passively early may not subjectively be the most fun way to play the game, but it is the smart way. There are some Nauts who are strong early and still let you play aggro, though. I'm rusty in Awesomenauts, but I would think that Froggy, Lonestar, Rae, and Penny all fit this category, in that they all can brawl from the start of the game.  I'd say that a very large number of MOBA players enjoy farming. There's no way League of Legends would have a tenth of the popularity it has now if people didn't like to farm, because that's the entire first phase of the game is dedicated to, and doesn't fall off until mid- to lategame (which can go up to an hour in length, although that's relatively rare). That's not to say that that's what Awesomenauts should become, but the point stands.  I think mullersmut was speaking strategically, not literally. :P Your house lighting on fire because your PC overheats dramatically would be worse too, but that's not relevant to the discussion."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Keebsy,2,Tue Jun 30 10:24:07 2015 UTC,"Finally, a great lectured person on the Internet that actually can respond to a comment peacefully and with a lot of sense. I'd like to elaborate some points that I might've lost in translation.  I agree with the meta shifts, although the playstyle has remained pretty much the same. Characters come and go, but the actual neutral game is pretty much unchanged. This might be good as the game can remain constant, but the game is not that well designed for it to remain in that stae for that much of the time. Also balancing 20-+ chars compared to the other rosters is kind of dissapointing, specially when you have a community so involved that would be happy to help.  The tiers in smash have remained pretty much the same for some years now, and there's the patch thing... Just look what they're doing to $ma$h 4. #20XX Designer intention is relevant where you can have patches every month, not just leave a CD for 14 years.  Agree with the smart part, the problem is the farm, rejoin and reward/assist system that fails. Getting to 1 lane in LoL against getting to another lane in Nauts.   Agree with aggro.  I don't know what to think about the brawl from start of the game.  I do enjoy farming, and i think is a great part of becoming a good MOBA player. I just think if the farming part has taken such a backseat in the game, it maybe should be focused in another strength of the game, just like Heroes of the Storm.  Yeah, but lag is THE MAIN factor of this game. Just see the tournaments to see if it isn't a factor to getting 8,500 dollars.  Thanks for taking the time! Pleasure to talk to intelligent people in the internets."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,Chevy_Chaser,2,Tue Jun 30 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"Ha, well those 5 things are despicable, but I was thinking more in the non-meta-game aspects.  But if we are talking meta, I agree.  Lag trumps all."
Awesomenauts,3bl8jq,slickmasterizzy,2,Tue Jun 30 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, matches in this game can snowball out of control very quickly. It's part of the genre though, unfortunately. Everyone starts out on even ground, but if one side gets a good play off, they are rewarded. So now they are even more powerful for the next engagement relative to you, so they will probably win that one too, and so on. The rich get richer and the poor fall farther and farther behind.  This is the reason the game has turrets though. In theory it should make the defending side stronger if they utilize them correctly. Playing defensive in general is just a good idea, actually. When I'm not feeling like being a hard carry for the team I enjoy playing Genji, because even if you get behind he has great waveclear (with his auto and exploding cocoon upgrade, if you so choose), and as long as you farm somewhat decently, he provides a lot of utility to the team.   The thing about damage-oriented Nauts, is that if they get ahead, they're good to go because you can force fights whenever you want. But if they get behind, then they are near useless. It is harder to carry a team with utility-based champs, but the upside to this is that they have less risk of being utterly useless.  That was a bit of a ramble, but hopefully it provides some insight into how to think about the game and climb ranks. :D"

So I opened the game and the thing you need to download for is called ""x264 High Quality (recommended)"" and I'm pretty sure it's recommended because it apparently gives max quality with absolutely tiny file size.  The reason you have to download a file to make it work though, even though it's natively supported, is that they don't have a license to include the file in their product?  IDK.

Ayla is also slower to move vertically, so once your jetpack runs out drop back down past her , as you drop down hit your second bite on her(it's a skill you will learn) at this point she will have no health and will back off(well at least that's the theory ;))"
Awesomenauts,3blxqv,Effective_Placebo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"If you are both at full hp at the start of this fight, Clunk will just lose. Clunk is the slowest naut and can't go faster than rage ayla, even if you go straight up. Of course in specific circumstances you can platform away, but rage Ayla beats Clunk in 1 on 1s in my experience."
Awesomenauts,3blxqv,_Ketchup,2,Tue Jun 30 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeh the main reason I say to fly up and stall her is so that you keep her over extended, so your team can come and it's no longer 1v1."
Awesomenauts,3blxqv,KEEVAN1234,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"If the information on Nautsbuilder is correct, Clunk isn't the slowest naut in the game. Probably would have been better to load the game up and get the information myself just to be safe, but I'm too lazy for that.    1st: Nibbs (7.8) 2nd: Sentry, Swiggins, Vinnie (8.0) 5th: Derpl, Skolldir, Raelynn (8.2) 8th: Ted, Scoop (8.4) 10th: Lonestar (8.6) 11th: Gnaw, Clunk, Voltar (8.8) 14th: Leon, Ayla (9.0) 16th: Yuri, Skree (9.4) 18th: Genji, Frog (9.6) 20th Raelynn (9.8, out of combat) 21st: Penny (10.0) 22nd: Coco (10.6) 23rd: Skolldir (11.6, after throw)    Again, very likely I made a mistake somewhere but I am 100% positive it says that Nibbs has 7.8 movespeed with boots while Clunk has 8.8 movespeed.    Edit: Fixed something that I typed incorrectly."
Awesomenauts,3blxqv,Effective_Placebo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"That seems crazy to me that many Nauts are slower than Clunk. I was way off on that if that list is correct. Granted, most of the nauts slower also have a dash or  have jumps that make quick vertical movement, which makes escaping from Ayla much easier. I'm also pretty sure  Derpl is quicker than Clunk so I'm definitely going to test that. And Coco is just faster than Rae when she's sprinting? I just want to test this now."
Awesomenauts,3blxqv,KEEVAN1234,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I recall correctly Clunk just has some of the worst acceleration in the game so he just seems slow at times but actually can reach a decent speed."

Awesomenauts,3blxqv,Slevens_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:51:27 2015 UTC,She may be powerful but fight her a range as you are only giving her more damage and more shield if you sit in that rage bubble.

Awesomenauts,3blxqv,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:27:12 2015 UTC,"You definitely want to play optimally vs her, like you suggested, but if you have a bad matchup, like Leon vs Ayla, you'll definitely want to play more conservatively vs her."

Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,Snaker1010,3,Sun Jun 28 21:30:07 2015 UTC,Doesn't harry use skolldir though? Skolldir doesn't really make a difference between keyboard & mouse over controller on him.
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,chaosfly10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:23:19 2015 UTC,He used to but I've not played him for a while when he's been using skoll.
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,Diasl,0,Mon Jun 29 08:39:44 2015 UTC,With mouse/keyboard you can aim your throw/punches behind you as you're retreating. With a controller you have to change movement directions to do that. Not a big difference but it can mean avoiding a death here and there.
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,ActionHotdog,3,Mon Jun 29 03:33:23 2015 UTC,With twin stick you can do the punches behind though.
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,chaosfly10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"If you're the sort of person that is really used to using A to jump on a controller, switching away from that will be tough. That was the primary reason why I switched to keyboard/mouse (and then learned the other, character specific, benefits of that later)."
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,ActionHotdog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:34:40 2015 UTC,"I use controllers and I agree, using the twin sticks is impossible when you're used to jumping with A/x. I've thought about trying to do keyboard/mouse, but I somehow feel less in control, specially for movement. Is it really worth the change, specially if I have no interest (or skill) to become an elite player?"
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,fifosexapel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy (in my opinion) to get accustomed to aiming on screen with the mouse, which will have a positive effect on your gameplay. Even if you're not trying to be an elite player, it feels good when you're aware that you're playing better than before, doesn't it?"
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,ActionHotdog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"My main problem is that I've never felt comfortable using a mouse, even for regular computer use. and of course im comfortable using a PS3 controller, as ive been using the same layout for about 20 years.  But I have ben curious about using the mouse to be able to run away and shoot/punch. hopefully wont be too uncomfortable using a laptop"
Awesomenauts,3bfhuo,fifosexapel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"In that case you might be better off sticking with a controller. Definitely give it a shot in a practice match or two, but if it feels uncomfortable using a mouse, then no one's stopping you from using a controller."

Awesomenauts,3bf4ow,Slevens_,4,Sun Jun 28 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"Tedrisville is best picked up early where the 150 damage is going to be the most effective. I've heard of people buying it as their first and only item after dropping, but I'd prefer to go with airstrike and maybe one stage of regen.    You can use Tedrisville for multiple things really.     You can poke pretty safely with it, albeit it's a weak poke but it can add up pretty fast.   If the enemy team is in lane and you want to get some extra solar, you can try to use it to last hit droids. It's a little difficult to get used to the timing, but you'll get the hang of it eventually with some practice.   The most obvious use of it, picking up kills. Very often as Ted I find that people can get away with just a sliver of health, and base Ted has no way to easily hit people horizontally from long range. Tedrisville fixes this issue, but you have to be aware of how much health 150-165 really is before you can start to land some consistent kills.     I try to always have a Tedrisville shot ready if I'm not shooting or farming in lane just in case I see an opportunity to secure a kill.    That's all I've got I guess, good luck with playing Ted."
Awesomenauts,3bf4ow,KEEVAN1234,3,Sun Jun 28 18:09:47 2015 UTC,Start tedris then buy airstrike first back then build normally (I rush stun pack right after airstrike). alternate quickly between shotgun shells and snipes in close quarters combat. You should be able to chunk them down quickly like this. Poke when you have nothing better to do. DON'T FORGET YOU ARE MORE THAN A SNIPE EVERY SECOND. Use your airstrike to full potential like you always should. Playing tedris is easily the most distracting way to play ted as you may forget that you should still be playing ted like ted. Good luck gamer!
Awesomenauts,3bf4ow,Yxesca,3,Mon Jun 29 07:32:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely most useful early game, but it can be a really effective finisher/poke tool even mid/late game. Definitely try and get the most out of it early game though; invest into starstorm statue if you can afford to that early in.  As for general strats, you should probably practice aiming with it in a bot game. I personally find it easiest to aim in awesomenauts with 3 bars of sensitivity, but that's just me. Be sure not to neglect your other abilities too much. If anything lunges at you while you're sniping, then take the moment to blast them away with your shotgun before switching right back to machine gun.  Edit: Also kinda goes without saying, but it's an amazing tool for jungling. You won't even have to fully enter the jungle before you get your hp's worth off of critters."

Awesomenauts,3bf81m,ZubbleTheFearless,8,Sun Jun 28 18:25:35 2015 UTC,She already is regarded as S+ tier because of the long-range silence and Clunk damage with Lonestar mobility.

Awesomenauts,3bf81m,Asgardian111,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:23:23 2015 UTC,I agree all these things OP said are great for penny players but just give us more power to gank even the passive charge could be OP if you were chasing some one for more 3 seconds
Awesomenauts,3bf81m,Trenso,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think one of the interesting tensions of playing Penny is that you’re always navigating how to maintain your charges, which may require leaving that health creep alive or keeping those droids on your turret just a little longer. A passive charge increase would probably break this tension and make her a little less interesting to play, in addition to the balance problems other folks have mentioned here.  It is a cool idea though."

It would be a good replacement for grey man group, IMO.    In solo queue, when somewhat hurt and therefore dancing with the enemy team rather than charging in to get some charges from an enemy naut, you often cant afford to leave your teammates alone long enough to find some charges from creeps or the base. If people actually listened to defend commands and played it safe instead of dying in a 2v3, it wouldnt be an issue.  Something like this was my idea: 200 solar If you dont gain or spend charges for 3 seconds, you gain a charge.  This absolutely wouldn't be OP, as without hitting aa attacks it would mean her abilities each had a 24 second cooldown, effectively."

Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,stoereboy,9,Sat Jun 27 09:03:53 2015 UTC,"he would've gotten that kill without lag aswell. the dash occurred when you were still over there, so without lag you would've just died a few seconds earlier.  only thing that really sucks about this is that your brain already gave you that endorphin rush after surviving that then got cockblocked."
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Tanzklaue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:34:08 2015 UTC,He wasn't reconnecting that much though so he wouldn't have been out there and catching up to him in real time.
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,chaosfly10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:26:15 2015 UTC,"the dash occurred when you were still over there,   Based on....?"
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Takley,8,Sat Jun 27 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"based on... wht? what exactly is your question here? vinnie pressed dash when penny was on the other side of the map, then he had a lagspike, reconnected, and the events were palyed out as they happened on his screen.  without the lagspike things would've played out very much the same."
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Tanzklaue,-6,Sat Jun 27 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact it's utter nonsense?  Anyone who has actually played the game and doesnt excuse the nonsense like this knows that laggy characters can hit you when they never even cross your path i.e. when they are chasing you.  You have absolutely no idea where or when Penny and Vinnie were on Pennys screen  When i'm getting chased by a guy and his attack hits me from behind the tower when he wasnt close enough to hit me at all during the chase, how's that work in your mind then?  Or when a ball/explosion/mine etc all hits you when on your screen you never went close to the area so it's not like it's just a time delay?"
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Takley,4,Sat Jun 27 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"you have no idea how lag works. where penny was on ehr screen is irrelevant. where penny was on vinnie's screen when he dashed, that#s what counts. attackers advantage is how lag works in nauts.  iu don't fault you for not knowing/understanding though. most people can't comprehend that their screen isn't the entire truth."
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Tanzklaue,-9,Sat Jun 27 19:35:49 2015 UTC,You literally just ignored the whole point of the post LOL.  Learn to read before speaking.
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,Takley,2,Sat Jun 27 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"No, he's right. You honestly have no clue how lag works.  In the chase scenario you spelled out in the prior post, it is totally meaningless that you didn't think the character was close enough to hit you. If he was close enough to hit you on his screen, then he was able to hit you. Lag compensation in Awesomenauts favors the attacking player, and has worked in your favor as much as it has worked against you; you just can't discern when it has worked in your favor, because it looks like a clean kill on your screen."
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,precursormar,2,Sat Jun 27 20:40:31 2015 UTC,He actually explained you have the wrong idea of how lag works.    When someone is lagging: on their screen you are where you were a few seconds ago. AKA: a 200 ping vinne sees the position you were at 2 seconds ago. This is because of the delay between communication.   On Vinnie's screen: You were on the other side of the jumppad where he spikedived.
Awesomenauts,3ba2j6,100mar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:51:58 2015 UTC,200ms = 0.2 seconds  2 seconds of lag would be absolutely unplayable o.o

About 7 minutes in we realize we haven't seen Leon all game. I go back to the shop and there he is, ""reconnecting."" He regains control, walks two steps, ""reconnecting"" again. He was lagging so hard that it took him the first ten minutes just to make it to our jungle.  Of course the situation was exacerbated because me and Coco asked him to leave, and he decided to stick around out of spite. Never even made it into a team fight."

Awesomenauts,3baq1n,TheMesp,12,Sat Jun 27 12:02:13 2015 UTC,"Let's talk the upcoming Kuri Mammoth buff  It's a pretty controversial topic on the forums for now. For those unaware, In the beta currently, BKM also reduces the effects of slows such as Yuri's timewarp and Rae's Timerift.  One side is contesting how this is a huge nerf for rae and yuri, especially to yuri who isn't that powerful to begin with.  On the other hand, though, this kuri buff will also give derpl a much-needed buff against timerift, which wouuld previously completely shut down a seiged derpl.  What are the subreddit's thoughts?"
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,Geonjaha,8,Sat Jun 27 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"While its good that Derpl now stands a chance against one of his three big counters, the nerf to Rae and Yuri just pushes Coco and Froggy G even higher above every other 'naut."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,TheMesp,8,Sat Jun 27 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"So, how about we give derpl a special kuri (like rae has special boots) with this effect?"
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,TheGullibleParrot,6,Sat Jun 27 17:25:16 2015 UTC,"Instead of a special Baby Kuri, why can't Siege come with complete timewarp nullification? The ability, after all, promises complete CC immunity, and timewarp is the only CC that Derpl is affected by in it.  Otherwise I could see a Derpl-specific BKM being something like this:  Baby Kitty Mammoth: Reduces effects of all CC (plus timewarp) plus gives you a CC immunity shield after exiting Siege.  2 stages, 25% immunity, +.6 shield duration. 150 solar per stage."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,Geonjaha,7,Sun Jun 28 07:55:46 2015 UTC,"It would make sense, especially considering normal Kuri is almost useless to any siege derpl."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,floatingfast77,2,Sat Jun 27 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"That actually would make perfect sense and fix this problem almost entirely, making Derpl a much more viable pick without overbuffing BKM for everyone else."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,BexleySmith,4,Sun Jun 28 06:28:04 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings.  Obviously it's good news for Derpl and other fat Nauts, but what about Nauts who don't have an issue with time?  Timerift's slow, when cut in half, is still painfully slow, it's even more hard to notice when Rocket is involved. And I could be just seeing things, but I think Warhead might do more damage when you're in the rift with BKM.  Meanwhile, BKM hard counters Timwarp. The slow on base Warp is now unnoticable with BKM, even with both Slow upgrades the slow is still pitiful.   This also makes Froggy and other escapers (don't know if there's an official term) EVEN more slippery than before, which makes Yuri pure Frog bait now, as he has no way to actually deal with him.  To be honest, I'd prefer the timewarp reducer on specific nauts, having it all round is too convenient and makes Yuri's slow upgrades even more unpopular."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,Yxesca,3,Sat Jun 27 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should effect Yuri at all considering his slow is borderline useless unless you buy slow upgrades anyway (key-word ""borderline""). Either that or only have it effect both abilities with 1 stage because 50% seems like a lot for the kind of abilities they are.  But r.i.p. mindless Raelynn rift builders. Lata :)"

I want to know your guys opinions on him, weather you think he is OP, balanced or just needs some tweaks.  Personally the 5s slow I think has to be reduce to 3s or reduce the max slow to something around 30%."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,floatingfast77,3,Sat Jun 27 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"disclaimer: I don’t have the beta, so this is based on videos I’ve seen of Rocco being played.  I feel like the base range + range upgrades on his AA are a bit ridiculous. I realize he’s a slow moving Naut, but his base AA is already able to fly across a good chunk of the screen. The range upgrade just makes that even worse, and once his AA is all upgraded he can really spam it from a distance.  According to Nautsbuilder, with certain builds he can actually reach the highest DPS in the game, ~797: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Rocco/0000000000000013100001000000/16-16-16-17"
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,Slevens_,2,Sat Jun 27 20:24:33 2015 UTC,Yeah he can with ease cheese turrets and bases from more than Hubble Lens Yuri can.
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,_Ketchup,2,Sat Jun 27 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you here. I'm genuinely worried about how well he will be able to poke. Just think about it. People get annoyed at tetris vile Ted ...that's just one of roccos AAs. The zoning could feel quite obnoxious as you will have to hide behind turrets or out of eyeline from Rocco for the majority of the match.  This again as /u/floatingfast77 said is just my prediction based on videos I have seen of him, please feel free to prove me wrong!"
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,floatingfast77,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:19:29 2015 UTC,"That’s a good comparison—I forgot about Tedrisville Ted. Though this won’t be quite as tough to avoid as that, the truth is that Rocco can pretty much zone everyone with painful ease."
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,TheMesp,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:52 2015 UTC,797 dps. That's absurd.
Awesomenauts,3baq1n,floatingfast77,2,Sun Jun 28 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"I think it is worth pointing out that that kind of DPS would only apply if he was hitting you at point blank, such that all 3 arrows could connect. This is quite possible if he catches you out of position, pops Vengeance, and then unloads all manner of AA at you. But I suppose if you’re caught out of position you would probably die to most Nauts. The real issue, I think, will be the mere threat of his AA which will offer him some of the best zoning in the game.  sidenote: he seems to have pretty significantly reduced turret damage, so I’m not too worried about his pushing."

People late joining can thow things off balance. Sometimes you know you're going to lose and still spend quite a lot of time hopelessly defending your base and getting killed, while you would rather get it over with and move on to the next match.  Only happens occasionnaly though, most matches I find fun and challenging from beginning to end."
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,dardarian89,5,Sat Jun 27 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"There is a big lean towards the late game nowadays. It's critical to understand that late game > early game to  have a much better time in those 40 minute matches. Also, some nauts like Leon just benefit heavily from that fact, so either hate them or join them."
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,whypcisbetter,2,Sat Jun 27 12:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Leon's early game is the weakest imo. It sucks that he completely avoided that but it's not like he knew either :/   When you're stomping a team and a dangerous late joiner pops up with a double kill or triple, that either means you just lost or you're one double/triple away from losing."
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,Acr1m,4,Sat Jun 27 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"I totally see your point. Only in a minority of matches will you have that really satisfying win. But to me, the gameplay on the way there is almost always fun regardless. I guess that's why I still find the game enjoyable; the gameplay itself is just so dynamic and fun, one of the best I've ever experienced. I've decided to stop being so occupied with whether I win or lose, or what league I'm in, and just have fun playing the game."
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,floyd1989,3,Sat Jun 27 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you floyd, the best part of this game for me is how much fun I'm having mid match.   I recently started playing League casually as well and, with the larger teams, it really helps even out a lot of the blame on losses along with the muuuch slower paced playmaking.   League also has a forfeit system, so honorable players wishing to move on to the next match can do so without a blow to their conscience and rating like in Awesomenauts.   All of these things help to soften the blow to your ego, which many would consider to make it more ""fun"".   Honestly though, Awesomenauts gameplay mid match is waay more satisfying for me. The playmaking (kills, turrets, etc) happens much more frequently and there's a LOT more room for influence with movement as League (like Awesomenauts) has 2D movement, but Awesomenauts has 2D movement with acceleration (gravity & bumpers) which make a BIG difference"
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,Acr1m,5,Sat Jun 27 19:46:00 2015 UTC,400 hours in and I play more than ever.
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,boredgamelad,3,Sat Jun 27 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself here, but after well over 500 hours on this game, I still find it incredibly fun. I have to consciously stop myself from playing most nights or I’ll stay up way too late. Of course I have frustrating games now and then, maybe due to a latejoin or a bad teammate or two, but that actually just fuels the fire for me; I constantly want to get better and better, so losing is motivation for me.  I’m also just a real sucker for the mechanics of it. I love platformers and this combines some great platforming elements with broader MOBA tactics for the perfect blend of fast-paced brawling and high level strategy."
Awesomenauts,3bafkw,floatingfast77,2,Sun Jun 28 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"Its a team game, you're going to get differently skilled teammates on your team. But well, so is everybody else. Thats how matchmaking works, and its not possible for it be otherwise honestly. The relevant thing to remember is that things will balance out over both you and your opponents over multiple games and your skill will be the differentiator.    Compare it to a lot of real sports. Even the best teams will just get blown out and have some deflating stupid losses sometimes. Over the course of a season though, their record cuts through the randomness. Other than the purest of strategy games, randomness will always be a large component in wins/losses unless you look at a large enough sample of games. The closer two opponents are in skill the MORE randomness is a factor, and the more games can feel ""unfair""! This is just game theory...  The idea that ""developing your character"" is superior to winning seems to be a mistake in scoping the goals of this game though. It might be aesthetically pleasing to max out, but if youre setting that as your goal rather than pushing, you're not focusing on the point of the game. If developing your character is why you play the game, then I can see why you may have less fun with it -- its something that helps you reach your goal but it is not the goal in itself!  It is a bit jarring when a completely different character joins the opposing team and you have to adjust your strategy to deal with them. I dont mind that though. More often then not it doesn't seem to matter. If a better player joined their team that you can't counter efficiently, well then they're probably the better team now and deserve to win anyway. I agree it is unusual that the opposing team can jump from being worse than you to better than you mid match like that though.  Anyway, I play this game instead of LoL/Dota, etc because I like the style of gameplay much more. Side scrolling brawler is exactly my type of game. I don't really care if I lose or win more often, I just enjoy actually playing the matches :)"

Awesomenauts,3bav0i,Gumbink,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Well he is technically correct  ""Beta access on Steam for all the new features and characters that we'll release in Awesomenauts Starstorm""  Means youll get beta access to content related to starstorm, but rocco isnt a starstorm naut.  The following controversy is what bothers me personally about the whole situation. Beta access can be something exclusive for a game and a reward. But what ronimo doesnt understand, is that its mostly only the case for games with a big community and a high demand to get into the beta as you have to restrict the access in some way because the influx of testers would be overwhelming.     This however is NOT the case with awesomenauts. Awesomenauts consists of a small community and not many players care to beta test patches, meaning that they NEED as many players as they can get to test their patches instead of playing hard to get. You could look at all the botched patches after every beta phase and take it as empirical proof. Either there werent enough beta testers and feedback to influence their changes or they dont listen anyway and betas are meaningless (which is dont hope/think is the case).  So in conclusion they should treat betas like they were back in the old days. As a non-profit help to test and improve their game instead of being of an early look at the content locked behind a paywall."
Awesomenauts,3bav0i,zeg685,4,Sun Jun 28 14:57:46 2015 UTC,Same thing happened with scoop when it was announced and no one said anything regarding this subject.

Awesomenauts,3bav0i,whypcisbetter,-1,Sat Jun 27 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but my point is stating that 2.11 Beta should not be exclusively towards backers for the beta for Starstorm, which I assume isn't related to 2.11 unless they are featuring something from Starstorm that I'm not aware about."
Awesomenauts,3bav0i,Pancroz,3,Sat Jun 27 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Beta access for all content (not just  starstorm) is a perk of backing the kickstarter. ""Beta access"" isn't split into 2 categories (Starstorm/non-Starstorm).  The wording of it in that description is strange, because it only specifies new features and characters released during Starstorm but the bottom line is Beta access is Beta access.   I think they specified that because it directly relates to people interested in Starstorm content."
Awesomenauts,3bav0i,Acr1m,2,Sat Jun 27 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"The beta access for Starstorm backers was never just for Starstorm nauts, but for the whole Starstrom timeframe, if not longer."

Awesomenauts,3b6su6,Cryphoenix,3,Fri Jun 26 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"Hello!   theawesomeguide.com is pretty old, if you want to make updated builds then nautsbuilder.com is the way to go. If you need builds then you can just ask here on Reddit for character specific builds; people love to share them! In a late join the person who has the late join gains solar equivalent or close the enemy team's solar. There is 3v3 and it's the third button on the game menu. The reason to why you are not able to play maybe due to not a lot of people playing or in your region. You may need to go into Worldwide dependant on where you live. Yes there is a ranked system. There are 9 Leagues to progress through, 9 being the lowest and 1 being the highest. What unlocks after games are characters and items for them, a progression system if you will. Meaning better items for more killing or supporting power. The friends list is your Steam friends list however you can invite your friends through the pre game menu before you join a session. Quick searching for a game just skips all the menus, nothing really special."

Awesomenauts,3b7qui,Haker10201,6,Fri Jun 26 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"try all the nauts so you know how their basic abilities work and then focus on the ones you like or are best with. In the lower leagues its easier to get kills because enemies will overextend. Try to find friends and play with them. Each game you lose do not blame your team, just focus on what you as a player could have done better. Solar wins games, which means kills, farming droids, and killing towers are all important. As you play more you will get better at finding a balance between farming droids and knowing when to go help your team fight and get kills, its not really a skill you can just explain it comes with practice and game sense. Oh and look at the map constantly to think about where you want to go next and where your enemies will show up if they are missing."
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,MisguidedWizard,3,Fri Jun 26 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"First of, welcome aboard! I also started playing awesome from the PS+ days and I've been hooked on the steam version for a while.   I usually hover around league 3-4, so it's not like I'm some sort of super pro, but I'll offer some general advice-   Not dying is important, cause it makes you lose money, gives the enemy team money a chance at 3v2 for a little bit. The more solar, the more powerful you become so that's key. So not overextending and know when you should go heal or head back to base is key. When you head back to base, make sure to know where your team is. If one of your team dies and the entire other team stays on the filed, try to stay back even if you're just defending the turret from behind until your team is back. Killing droids is key. If youre using ayla, remember that your basic attack has lifesteal, so attacking enemy droids from behind can serve as a pool of health and well as a mean to push. If things are calm, I always find it best to just got and kill or at least hurt the droids. Keep an eye on the minimap, if the droids are meeting up closer to your turret than the enemies, go fix that. If you see all 5 other player are in one lane or in the back, go kill the droids in the empty lane and try to push. You want to make sure the droids are at the very least meeting in the middle or in the enemy territory. The reason you want that is that in case of deaths on your team (be it single, double or a wipeout), if the droids are in favor of the enemies you will probably lose that turret. Defending turrets is super important. Turrets cant be healed, so this go back to killing droids and stayign back and defending behind the turret. Know your opponents skills. Know that Rae doesnt go through turrets or hard walls, but cocos ball does. Know that vinnies spikes will husrt you unless youre way behind the turret. Always have an escape plan. Most nauts have at least one ability that helps you escape sticky situations by either displacing enemies, slowing them down, give you added mobility, whatever it is. Try to hold those abilities until you absolutely need them. If you go around squandering your abilities, good players will notice when you use them and attack you while they cool down. If the enemy team has only one naut on the field (after a double kill or a poorly times retreat), clear the droid lanes and try to push, even if you have low health unless you are being specifically followed by the one naut. The game menu where you can check the kill/death count also shows a timer on how long until an enemy respawns, so use that wisely If youre undecided whether you should push on defend in a mid to late game situation, I would recommend defending. Clear any droids on your side and stick close to your team and base."
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,fifosexapel,2,Sat Jun 27 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to discuss strategies this subreddit is a good place to start. Also the offical Awesomentaurs forum on the Ronimo website.   As for improving your skill, the best (and most fun way) in my opinion in just to play the game a lot. It's difficult at first but after a while you will figure out the more detailed mechanics, such as the difference between all the nauts and builds. In the end you will be better of then simply following the top build you find online without actually knowing the reason why.  Eventually the league increase will follow naturally. I'm currently about 25 hours into the game and still feel like I'm just scratching the surface, but that's part of the fun if you ask me."
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,dardarian89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"I mainly play dota 2 (I have like 3,500 hours or something) and I decided to try Awesomenauts because of the steam sale. I have played 26 games and I've just got into League 6 (I actually got promoted on a loss where I heavily outfarmed anyone else by over 1k but made a risky move to the point they took the core by the time I respawned), I believe the key to awesomenauts is to farm, bait well and punish mistakes which is pretty much exactly how I play dota. I play Rae mainly and I just realised that it's pointless to even try to solo kill people until you've got like 7 skill upgrades(I'm not even sure what the correct terminology is for this). Making use of the map advantages aswell seems huge, no one else seems to be doing this that I can tell. The map with the huge fucking microwave in the middle, whenever that's active I push my lane if I see 2 up there because I know 1 dude can't kill me and they have to rotate all the way round. The map with the solar bosses, kill them, kill fucking both of them. One that I've found frustrating about 'nauts is that you don't have all of the upgrades as soon as you start which puts you at a huge disadvantage, I can't get the range increase on snipe because I need to play a million games."
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,Robsquire,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:24:04 2015 UTC,"Note: Solar bosses may seem amazingly useful, but when you start making it into higher leagues, you can easily be caught in the solar boss alcove and if that's not the case, i.e. there are no enemies who can catch you off guard, your time is usually better spent pushing a lane."
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,Xiigen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:08:10 2015 UTC,Which league are you in? Can i ask is it better to let the droids fight it out at the very start so you can take the solar from your own droids when they die? I noticed it seemed pretty pointless to push because people try to 3v1 you very often if they get chance at the start and you can end up missing a wave of solar or so since its under their tower by wave 3 if you push
Awesomenauts,3b7qui,Robsquire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm in upper league 2. I've never just let my droids duke it out, that solar isn't worth as much as forcing your opponents to defend, or to get some damage on their turret. Never push hard enough to be ganked, especially early on.  The best thing to do early on is to keep the droids on your opponents turret so they are the ones defending, and pushing a lane with your whole team (carefully).  Not sure if I really answered your question."

You can use it to interrupt things like nado and snipe, or you can use it right after a teleport to help land fire breath a bit longer. It's not very effective though, it's just too short and her other upgrades are much better."
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,Kalazor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:41:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I saw a comment on the 'suggest suggested builds' thread (aweomsenauts forum) that mentioned stun being super useful, so I was starting to wonder what I was doing wrong when I found I couldn't get much mileage out of it. I shall relegate it to the end of my build for particularly annoying Raelynns who didn't get iron rifle.  Do you generally avoid berries? I find it pretty helpful for extra DPS straight out of teleport, especially against structures; at least when escape isn't going to be a problem. Also ultra-regen on tap is amazing, though a costly build at the expense of damage."
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,Chief_Outlaw135,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:32:04 2015 UTC,I use the max frenzy out of orb and pair it with the increased damage at max frenzy for fire. Then I use orb to initiate followed by fire more as a late game strategy
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,Trenso,2,Sun Jun 28 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"I dont use it because the max frenzy build are far better but a good way to build for it is orb slow, damage, and i suppose range or pull. And the AA would be stun damage and speed. Slow would help land the stun and lock them down some more and with attack speed you could get the max frenzy speed to start tearing them to shreds."
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,DMthePerson,2,Sat Jun 27 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"Stun isn't that bad of an upgrade. It's actually significantly underrated. It's good to use if you want to initiate with the orb (which I'd recommend taking slow and cooldown reset if you build around this playstyle), but it comes at the cost of having any remotely decent frenzy build."
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,fifosexapel,2,Sat Jun 27 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"I main skoldir, and his stun punch is my absolute favorite attack on the game. Yet, Nibbs stun is not part of my build. I've come to find frenzy regen indispensable, and it just doesn't mix well with stun. I do however, tend to be a more defensive minded player as nibbs, saving the teleport to get out of situations as opposed to using it to start the attack.  If you are a teleport initiatior, then stun would be a god send. Orb slow, pull, couple of stun hits and firebreath should get the done."
Awesomenauts,3b8e9n,fifosexapel,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:09:23 2015 UTC,Yeah after a couple of replies here I'm going to try to use it for initiation! I think on an early AA/orb build it could help me shred opponents :3
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,Legokun,6,Thu Jun 25 23:03:47 2015 UTC,The hitbox for spike dive is wonky and depends on which direction you do it in. Other directions have bigger ranges then others. I don't remember exactly but someone posted it here a while back.  EDIT: Remember kids. Diagonal dives are bad
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,chaosfly10,7,Fri Jun 26 00:58:40 2015 UTC,If you got the range upgrade you'd be able to have killed him from his jungle though.
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,DMthePerson,2,Fri Jun 26 03:18:30 2015 UTC,like 90% of why range is so good is because it makes your hitbox kinda work like it should.
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,Tanzklaue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'd always been more attracted to double dive or cooldown, but eventually I came to realize the range upgrade is really the way to go for overall dps. The amount of dives it lets you land way outweighs the extra damage imo."
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,DMthePerson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"nah, DSH for life.  it's just frustrating to sometimes miss out on 980 damage. but if you use your dash like a hammer pants dash you can minimize the amount of failures you get."
Awesomenauts,3b4og1,Tanzklaue,3,Sat Jun 27 00:10:42 2015 UTC,spike dive hitboxes were fucked when i started to play. don't expect ronimo to ever fix them.

Awesomenauts,3b5suq,Sudaii,6,Fri Jun 26 05:09:51 2015 UTC,"Personally I think its more important for your 2 mates to learn awareness first. You/they can be good with any naut however if they die/let you die due to lack of awareness then team comp doesn't matter all that much. The overall goal is for them to learn to predict what will be happening in the next 7 seconds and how to deal with problems .  In an example where the enemy team is pushing bottom lane on AI and you and your rae are defending it clunk could drop down and do lethal amounts of damage and a snipe could finish them off.   Once your friends get that down it'd be advisable then to get nauts down. I'd suggest you go swiggins as he would be the perfect extra to your current team. But your friends also need to learn things like ""never walk into Yuri bombs"" it may seem fundamental but lots of noons overlook that and things like it.   Most importantly though is that you stick together. Alone you're easily killed etc as a squad no for will want to engage. You can also learn how to lure them into traps.  I'd write more but I'm on my mobile. Just remember to have fun since its a game."
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,Eternal_Atom,2,Fri Jun 26 06:21:04 2015 UTC,"All that on a mobile? Wow! Awareness is much more important than comp, i agree. Personally, i would have put scoop in the team over swiggins just because Hammer is a much more reliable stun than chain. And Scoop has the ability to heal himself."
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,AirlineFood420,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:40:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on what ""reliable"" means. Chain is holding the enemy much longer than the snare.  Also Swiggins' AA is super strong.  Scoop is good for times where he can be long range, and stop enemies for a moment so his teammates can kill them. Clunk would be good there though.  Anyway, what other people said: Awareness first. When you understand the game fully it won't matter who the nauts are in the end."
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:17:29 2015 UTC,Good point. Thank you and all the others for the tips.
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,AirlineFood420,5,Fri Jun 26 08:15:54 2015 UTC,"Leon would fit in well with Rae & Clunk.  Teams usually work if they contain:   A Tank (Clunk/Derpl) A Support/Utility/Brawler (Voltar, Genji, Scoop, Sentry, Skree, Gnaw, Yuri, Skolldir, Ted, Swiggins.) A Hard Carry (Froggy, Coco, Penny, Ayla, Lonestar, Leon, Nibbs, Raelynn.)   For a team to really work you need to have:   Tankiness or Zone control. Clunk is amazing at being a tank, and ted is probably the best naut for controlling a lane. Having a tank is a really good deterrent for carries looking to make picks because tanks are hard targets. Having a tank can control where the enemies go, which is amazingly useful for winning games. CC, or the ability to engage/disengage. Scoop is really good for this as he can reliably snare and burst down targets. Genji is also good at this because he can Snare people with cocoon, and he can speed people up with blessing. He can also create hummingbird droids to push better. A hard carry, Having a hard carry is essential. They are how you control the enemy carries/brawlers. People are a lot less likely to engage when they have to face the threat of a 10/0 Froggy. If you can set up your carry with one or 2 early kills, then it is easier to shut down enemies before they hit their power spike.    Like i mentioned beforehand, Leon would fit so well with Raelynn and Clunk because he can pull people into timerift and explode. When teamfights go well you can turn invis and catch people who barely escape.   Pretty badly worded but hope it helps :)"
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,SwankyMango,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:29:20 2015 UTC,You forgot about Vinnie and Spike!!!
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,Kngrichard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:51:35 2015 UTC,Realynn + Clunk are very solid together. You already got good push and they are excellent in teamfights. You are only lacking some initiation.  Some options:   Add a Froggy/Vinnie for more burst / ganks. Add a Scoop for more poke. Add a Genji for even better fights. Add a Swiggins as a frontliner.   All of these options give you the initiation you need while also giving you some other good synergies.  Hope this helps! Have fun playing.
Awesomenauts,3b5suq,Monsterthedog14,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:17:05 2015 UTC,Sentry would be a good addition to this combination.
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,AirlineFood420,11,Fri Jun 26 07:28:05 2015 UTC,You were already going 8/0 against low level bots. This doesn't prove much yet.
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,rykounanba,-3,Fri Jun 26 08:52:48 2015 UTC,sort of meant to highlight how high his power ceiling is. and the fact that splitting doesnt have a DMG penalty to the first shot (Which it should.)
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,rykounanba,3,Fri Jun 26 09:12:32 2015 UTC,"Did not notice the dmg penalty thing but hey, it is still in beta so that will most likely be fixed before release. The rest is still pretty hard to judge imo because you could wreck with a lot of nauts in a similar situation."
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,DMthePerson,2,Fri Jun 26 09:20:20 2015 UTC,"I also think it should be taken into account he played against three really big targets. Even though they're all tanky, they're still taking a majority of his AA shots even at long range."
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,irrzir,2,Fri Jun 26 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"You don't have to notice.   Splitting effectively acts as a pierce, and none of the piercing items in the game lower the damage of the attack."
Awesomenauts,3b63ur,Acr1m,2,Fri Jun 26 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should have a damage penalty before the split because every other upgrade that adds piercing or aoe shots doesn't do that (rae, clunk, lonestar, froggy, etc)"

Awesomenauts,3b4uyc,Deimos_F,4,Fri Jun 26 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to increase your precision to make each shot count, pick up Clunk. His shot are slow, but very important in close range brawls, teaching you to snipe and how to pick each of your shots.   For Clunk, you almost want to hit them point blank, but it's a habit that will transition to all your nauts."
Awesomenauts,3b4uyc,Acr1m,2,Fri Jun 26 01:36:36 2015 UTC,Not something I'd recommend usually: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Sheriff_Lonestar/1100210000000012201001321000/1-25-24-19-2-16-16-17-17-24-5-5-6-23-23-23  Lonestar has a good AA and if you've got the attack speed then you really need good aim make the most of it. Give it a try!  Not huge on taking punishment though - but then that's what the lifesteal dynamite is for. Instead of tanking try taking advantage of his triple jump to make yourself hard to hit.
Awesomenauts,3b4uyc,Stupid-Flanders,2,Fri Jun 26 00:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Swiggins on the AA requirement alone, but asking then to take a bit of punishment cemented the deal for me.  Here is a link to a post that posted my previous Swiggins posts.  It's been quite a while, but what I say in each of those threads still holds true over the passage of time.  Pretty muck, Swiggins is forced to rely on his AA half of the time when the skill lockout occurs.  People deal with this by either building burst to try and kill them before they get away, or by constantly attacking the enemy with their amazing, high fire rate, 130 damage ink shots.  I choose the latter because it offers excellent pushing power as well as pressure even when Swiggins' skills are all on CD.  You have an amazing jump and very high mobility for a tank, while being able to lock down people for 3 seconds at base to keep shooting at them.  Just remember that you have to commit to any kills you want to get, so try and pick off isolated targets.  Also for more general AA build strats, there is also this thread where I expressed my love for all things aa.  Go check that out as well if you want more generalized tips."

Awesomenauts,3b4uyc,redria7,2,Fri Jun 26 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"Both, but mostly the latter.  I've noticed I tend to subconsciously undervalue AA and overvalue abilities, which explains why the first nauts I was able to use successfully were nukers."
Awesomenauts,3b4uyc,redria7,3,Fri Jun 26 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Ok. I have a lifesteal Coco build I run (mid league 1) where I max out auto attack before doing almost anything else. Not only is it super powerful for dealing damage and for sustain, but if you stop attacking you die. It is really good for learning to respect the power of auto attack when uses in conjunction with even base abilities.   I'll post it once I'm at a computer."

You learn to use your AA and use it hard, or you die. :D  Due to the nature of the lifesteal, you can take a lot more punishment than you would otherwise.

Awesomenauts,3b32ul,Deimos_F,5,Thu Jun 25 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"Raelynn is probably one of my favorite 'nauts to play behind Coco and Leon, so I'll try helping you out a little.  First things first, Rae's snipe can be dodged, but a good Rae never misses her snipe, whether it be a mid-air jump pad Sorona snipe, a Ribbit IV jumppad snipe, or an Auguillon drop snipe through the funnel below the invis eye. Practice your sniping skills until you can even face off against max difficulty Rae bots, because they have like a 99% hit rate.   Rae's rift, IMO, is better than her snipe if you make use of it well. If you're noticing that people never walk into your rift, then you're not using the rift properly. The rift can be a tough, but rewarding ability to land. Use it when someone's chasing you, use it when you drop down on someone, use it when they land right in front of you hoping the surprise you, etc.. There are so many opportunities for Rae to get kills with the rift. If you're having trouble understanding what I'm describing, go on YouTube and look up some of theNadaPop's Rae kill montages, because Nada plays the meanest Rae I have ever seen.   Also, I have to disagree with your last point where you stated that Rae has no way of pursuing fleeing targets. She can easily catch up to people with her movement speed and if your target is fleeing, the chances are that his/her health is low enough that you can finish the kill with a couple AA shots, unless they have an ability to aid in escape. (Penny dash, froggy dash, nibbs orb, sentry teleport, etc...)  -Rae doesn't need a snare capable team to ensure a kill. If you play smart, you will be that snare capable team member that your other two teammates rely on.   Hopefully I helped a bit.  Play safely and have fun! :)"

Awesomenauts,3az5e4,SnipingBeaver,14,Wed Jun 24 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"It's actually kind of a good thing for competitive, believe it or not.   Coco is currently the only true 'anti-turtling' naut in the game, with Penny and Sentry kinda doing what she does but not nearly to the same extent. This means that you are pigeonholed into choosing one naut if your gameplan is disproportionately countered by turtling.  Especially in the context of the new pick/ban system, it doesn't make sense to pin all of that role on one naut.     Of course, there comes a problem when players think ""Turret = Safety"", and this is frustrating for new players especially because a good Coco can seemingly hurt you from anywhere.   I've yet to see how other games deal with turtling though - so maybe there's another way to do it that I don't know."

Personally I wouldn't suggest blind snipe however it can have it's perks like not allowing an enemy to see if they walk into Gnaw spit or Coco blaze.  However I personally build this. http://nautsbuilder.com/#Raelynn/1220010132000213002011301002/1-8-25-3-3-2-2-21-16-16-16-19-19-6-28-28-23-23-23-9-9-9-10-10-14-14  I prefer the early rift build because of zoning, trapping and easy droid farming to which this will turn into a HC Bomb build for quick 510 aa bursts and 170 aa against enemy 'nauts.

Why do neither of these builds use the free solar upgrade or the more hp from jungle minion kills upgrade? I thought they were pretty useful. I can understand the free solar one because it takes up a slot and isnt worth the free 100 or so solar, but I thought the extra hp was pretty useful.   What are your thoughts on this?"

As to why I do not take Monkey Paw is because in a HC Bomb build, damage is manditory rather than extra solar on kills and I also find for the Snipe build the 130 damage on everything with piercing is better than the solar.  Don't get me wrong it is a really good upgrade (Monkey Paw) however I prefer more damage over more solar; personal choice really."

Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,ACompetitiveHalo,4,Thu Jun 25 04:40:20 2015 UTC,"All my advice consolidated:  Items:   Rush Snare Duration and Nuke Damage.  Everything else is optional after Snare and Nuke.    Mindgames:   Snare hiding spots and jumppads for the first 5 minutes of the game. Once you've established that you control the jumppads, hidingspots, etc - you don't really need to put snares there too often. The scare factor is enough and now you're free to start actively catching people.  Get somebody to chase you. This is the easiest way to catch somebody as a newbie - since all you have to do is drop a snare and then stop right in front of it. Derpl's massive bod' will bodyblock until the arming time is done.  Where is it logical for the enemy to go?. It may be possible to just jump in front of someone and pop a snare. e.g if it logical for the enemy to continue chasing somebody they're already chasing, or if it is logical for them to chase after that health creep - they probably will.  Anticipate your Siege. Keep tabs on all of your snares and anybody close to them. If you think somebody is going to hop into one, siege. Do not wait until after they are already in - because by then the snare might have a fraction of its lifetime left. Deployment Pads are great for learning how to pre-siege. Kind of specific to fatcat, but can also work if your cat damage is maxed: Fire off a cat before you siege. With Fatcat, one click is worth anywhere between 280 and 400 extra damage.  The jump button is the panic button in this game. People jump when they see anything dangerous. Put your snares in the air and you will get quite a few more kills   Of course, to see it in action, here's a shameless post of my video from like 2014.     edit: I used old damage values."
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,irrzir,3,Thu Jun 25 11:34:45 2015 UTC,"WARNING: Massive wall of text coming!   Derpl is definitely a tough naut to play so I hope what I say helps you a little bit.  Things to Note:  -Yup! As you said, Derpl has two builds, Cat and Siege. Personally, I think Siege is the stronger build IF you know how to play it as a good siege Derpl can carry a team to the Gates of Sorona (Hehe. Mad Max reference.)  -Derpl is extremely tanky and powerful in Siege mode. However, he isn't invincible. Being in Siege Mode makes you very vulnerable to burst and ganks, as well as displacement such as a Sköll throw or a Leon tongue. To avoid this, know when to get out of Siege mode and just hightail your ass out of there. If you're pushing a turret after a double kill, and you notice that the two enemies have just landed, and you're on the enemy's half of the map, get out unless you have your entire team supporting you and they're ready for a Teamfight.  -Derpl is countered by a variety of 'nauts. Rae's time rift is a great example of why you have to be careful in Siege mode, as well as Sköll's throw, Leon's tongue, Skree's saw, and Coco with knock back on ball. If you see these 'nauts, stick with your team or stay on your half of the map unless you're confident that you can get away safely or secure a kill.  Now, moving on the dos and dont's of Derpl.  Dos:  -Derpl's grid is a VERY useful, but hard to land ability. Think smart and note where enemies tend to go to on tight paths and corridors. If you're on Sorona, place them in the middle hidden area. Auguillon? Place them in either hidden area above top or below bottom lane, or in the funnel below the Invis eye. Ribbit IV? The hidden area right below top lane makes for a great unsuspected nuke surprise when they use the jumppad on bottom lane. AI? A little tougher, but the glass platforms above the fire incinerator on top lane make for a good escape denier.  -Derpl works amazing with a team. If there's a Teamfight going on, always make sure you're a part of it and if you're a little late to the party, pull a Clunk and drop nuke them.  -YES! I got him snared! throws out nuke (Snare runs out and enemy escapes.) Happens a little too often, huh? Try getting silence on your snares or duration on snares. Snare duration on Derpl pretty much ensures a kill unless your team didn't seize the opportunity and let him/her slip.  -If you have a support on your team, preferably Voltar, but Genji and Yuri are good too, you can tank a turret and usually destroy it if it has 3-4 bars left. Seize the opportunity if no enemies are near and if your droids are taking a bit too long to push.  Dont's:  -Know when to get out of Siege. Too many times I've seen a Derpl stay in Siege mode until the team is already shooting/punching/lasering/butterflying/etc... and they try desperately to get out and run away but it's already too late. If you're on the enemies half of the map, USE THE MINIMAP. If you see an enemy disappear off the map and it looks like he/she's coming your way, get out.  -Kinda obvious, but don't shoot randomly if you're in a hidden area. The enemy team can see your bullets flying out of the hidden area and if you're looking for that snare-nuke kill, you'll never get if you wave flashing lights on the map saying, ""I'm right here!""  -Don't leave your team. Derpl can work 1v1, but he lacks super crazy stopping power against a 1v3 burst team comp, so if you stick by your team, your survivability increases so much.  That's about it! As for builds, go with what suits you best. Personally, I like starting out with this one:  -Snare-Nuke-Regen-Duration of snare-Nuke damage-Nuke speed-Slow on turretshot-Damage of turretshot. The rest depends on who I'm fighting and how the match is going. I also like to switch the order of snare duration and nuke damage if I feel like they're not getting away that often.  Yeah, sorry for the length. The words must be killing you.  TLDR; Don't siege too long. Turret pew pew. Snare duration. Slow turretshot good. Help team. Don't die. Rae strong.   Edit: Added warning because of too much text."
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,uzimule,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:09:53 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna play Siege Derpl, you absolutely need to perfect the art of divebombing, or sieging in the air/on a floating platform, prepping a nuke, and blowing it up in the enemy's faces as you land. It's one of the best ways to get kills as Derpl, but requires a lot of map awareness/mistake capitalization to do effectively.  Some other tips:   Derpl can fall through glass platforms in Siege mode. Abuse this. Place traps in high-traffic areas that your enemies won't see coming, like in the middle jumppad route on Ribbit, the vertical jumppad behind the towers on AI, or on the glass platforms in front of the bottom turrets on Sorona. Don't play too passively or you WILL lose. Always be on the hunt for kills of any kind, whether that be creeps or enemy 'nauts. Never stay in Siege Mode for longer than it's necessary.  But don't overextend, either. Derpl is slow and has a huge hitbox, so CC screws him up something crazy. Again, don't stay in siege for too long. DO NOT PIGGY. A Derpl without Medican and boots is overly susceptible to poking. Base abilities out the gate work just fine. Don't rush anything but nuke damage early game unless you know for certain that your team is able to capitalize on upgraded snare traps. I usually build either Nuke Damage > Snare Duration > Nuke Size or Nuke Damage > Snare Duration > Snare Silence, depending on the team lineup. Turret Damage > Bullet Slow > Shield is generally a pretty good turret build. You should always build into Siege after you're done with traps/nuke/utilities unless you desperately need cats for some reason. Keep in mind, also, that Deployment Pads has a mini-stun as well as the knockback, perfect for dealing with those annoying-ass RBAY Frogs. Cat Derpl doesn't work on people who actually know how to play. Keep that in mind. Did I mention to not stay in siege for too long? Don't do that.   Hope this helped. I'm in L2 and have been maining Derpl for a solid 1 1/2 years now. He's a ton of fun once you get the hang of him."
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,TheGullibleParrot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:44:59 2015 UTC,"/u/uzimule has already made quite some good points, but I wanted to add some to it. (I'm a League 3 Derpl main)    duration on trap is the most godlike upgrade for a good team. (easiest gank opportunities come from a 2.8second snare)  if you focus on siege, try to get slow before you upgrade your damage on turret. (this will hinder the opponent + give you an easier time nuking them if they get out of snare) if you go siege, first nuke/snare (depending on your own preference. I prefer to get at least 1 stage of snare duration before I upgrade nuke) and second turret. if you go cats, you're best off getting 2 stages of damage first (or bat catsuit) so you can kill the creeps/critters in 1 hit.  NEVER, EVER, should you stay in siege in a random part of the map. My experience is that you want to be as mobile as possible. ALWAYS unsiege if you don't need to be sieged anymore.  Learn about people's movement paths. place traps slightly above the ground (small hop + place trap) to ensure no droids get caught and a jumping naut might still get stuck.  Learn to love the hybrid derpl build. (Nuke/traps + cat) as it will serve you well.  Hardcounter against derpl that has been forgotten: Nibbs (her flamebreath WILL incinerate you if you are sieged),  Nauts to fear: first and foremost, all nauts with slow and/or a hard displacement (froggy/lone/leon/gnaw/ayla/coco/skolldir/yuri/genji/ted/penny/skree). And other cases: Froggy G (tornado with RBAY), Lonestar (bull with damage + slow), Genji (cocoon when you want to nuke), Yuri shares similar tactics with a regular Derpl (hidden spots, surprise attacks). So yes, you are in most people's books an easy target just waiting to be ganked.  (This mostly counts when the opponent's team is actually working as a team. Any of these solo can usually be taken on quite easily if you know what you're doing) Need an early-game farming advantage? Get Fatcat. It might hurt you lategame, but if you can't clear droids well enough it's a great upgrade. (Get all damage upgrades on cat after you do this (lategame). 400 dmg burst is not bad, even lategame) If you build hybrid or catderpl, get boots. Else you can decide for yourself what you prefer.  Always get base abilities first. Even if you go catderpl.   That's what I got to say about it."
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,jafel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:53:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the tips so far. My other question would be, what exactly are shield's uses? I know they protect you from damage, but they seem to only work while transforming, not necessarily while you are IN siege mode. Why exactly would that half-a-second of 21%+450dmg shield be useful? Usually if I am gonna go into siege mode, it'll be because I know it's safe. The only reason I'd suppose I'd need to reduce my damage while TRANSFORMING is if I were gonna siege in a lot of spots where it wouldn't be safe..."
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,jafel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:21:25 2015 UTC,The shields (should) work when in siege mode. I don't use shields 90% of the time so I wouldn't know whether that might be gone.
Awesomenauts,3b1e7j,uzimule,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"The 21% damage reduction should work in siege mode if I remember correctly. If you want, you can stack it with the 10% damage reduction on the fourth upgrade tier as well. As for the 450 damage reduction shield, I have noticed that it seems to be only when transforming into siege, which is kinda unhelpful. However, I may be mistaken as I've only bought the upgrade once, as it usually is not that useful compared to damage, slow, and damage reduction on siege mode."

Awesomenauts,3az4f0,KEEVAN1234,11,Wed Jun 24 17:42:37 2015 UTC,1.4S AOE STUN  THAT IS ALL.
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,DespondentDynast,7,Wed Jun 24 18:53:32 2015 UTC,He's basically Ashe from LoL. Tbf the arrow looks easy to dodge when it's shot at you from a distance as you can see it on the map. And the stun doesn't activate until a certain distance. Could be annoying as a tank like clunk though.
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,_Ketchup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"Ashe is, in turn, based on Drow Ranger/Undead Sylvanas from Dota."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,Revoran,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:51:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not saying the attack is overpowered but the upgrade synergy is concerning. 1.4s single-target stun is forgivable, AoE skillshot is ok, but when you get the AoE and the stun at the same time then things become problematic."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,DespondentDynast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:16:34 2015 UTC,"yeh I agree it could make for some gimmicky deaths, which are never fun"
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,_Ketchup,7,Thu Jun 25 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Rocco looks like an amazing naut. He's got an extremely powerful kit and from what I saw of his upgrades he's only going to get more crazy as the game goes on.    His base AA looks really good. Decent attack speed, each arrow does moderate damage but landing both results in a decent chunk of damage (55 per arrow). The upgrade to add more arrows seems somewhat niche but could be good in a teamfight situation or if you fight a lot of nauts up close since it adds a more shotgun-esque effect to the arrows.    The long range arrow ability seems to be one of the best abilities in the game for damaging/killing nauts. The damage starts off low, but upgrades could probably make it become really threatening at long ranges. There was also some mention of a stun I believe at long range, which could result in some really neat ganks assuming the Rocco is able to land the arrow.    The last ability (revengeance or something?) is very similar to stimpack, but the slow and ability to increase the duration based on how many arrows are landed is very interesting and will make the ability much more skill based upon how well you can land each AA.    I REALLY like Rocco, definitely going to pick him up as soon as the full update goes live."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,DMthePerson,6,Wed Jun 24 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"Abilities: A bit simple, which isn't that bad of a thing. Not to say he doesn't bring anything to the table, but all of his abilities are very easily comparable to other nauts. He doesn't have that big amazing gimmick like every other new naut usually comes with (unless you count his ability to see his projectile/aiming radius on the minimap, which is now a feature both Coco and Ted share). Playstyle: Obviously comes with a grain of salt since it's the first beta, but he feels incredibly strong. Being able to hit anyone from anywhere on the map and having an aa that fires from that far of a distance will likely remain very potent and competitively useful even after his abilities get dialed back a bit. More importantly though, he feels a bit spammy, which might not be so easy to tweak once they give him proper balancing. I can see him becoming a a popular character to complain about in the community.  Appearance/Concept: Super badass. Pretty much cooler than I ever imagined he'd be. Probably up there with my favorite looking nauts."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,Tanzklaue,6,Wed Jun 24 19:39:21 2015 UTC,his sprite though. he looks like a bloated fat parrot.
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,DMthePerson,0,Wed Jun 24 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more like a budgie. But I dunno, kinda easier to get used to after looking at it for a while."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,irrzir,3,Wed Jun 24 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"He is slow and not very mobile without boots.  Boots make his mobility better, but Assassin Flags makes it waaay better. His AA is pretty cool, kinda like what a shotgun should be like - reliable up close but doable from afar. You can charge his Precision Shot and AA at the same time. You can keep it primed indefinitely it seems. He only does half damage to turrets, which is alright I suppose The Precision shot passes thru Skree's totem just like Coco's ball."
Awesomenauts,3az4f0,flamedbaby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"Considering he has about 480 DPS with a maxed AA, doing half damage to turrets is probably a good thing."

Awesomenauts,3axabf,uzimule,12,Wed Jun 24 06:22:00 2015 UTC,"The biggest disadvantage Vinnie has is his movement predictability.  The way he has to bounce means he is really easy to chase and hit. Rae, Coco, Skolldir, and Rage Aylas have a field day landing every iota of damage  on him. That's why his escape and sustain are so important. Just as important as damage IMO."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,Xpreshion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Vinnie is a very easy naut to chase, but he's also a master of escapes so it all comes down to who's the better player. Usually as I'm chasing him, he throws down a silence cloud and I can't keep up the chase both because I'm blinded and I can't activate my speed on Blaze. Of course, getting him to retreat is good, but he heals up quite quick so it's only like 20 seconds of him off the battlefield."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,NetherPlebiscite,0,Wed Jun 24 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"I have spent a lot of time playing Vinnie and I can see why you don't like him as a coco main.  First, I think your point on solar is misguided. His potential for solar is really through Loan Shark (+50 per kill) because in most matches Vinnie gets the kill shot, unless pesky Gnaw steals them with a tic of dot. I usually get the solar farm move though, but my motivation is for life gain not money gain.  Also if taking all damage upgrades his spike can hit for 980, although I only get that against tanks.  I think Vinnie counters coco very well because he can fly and is pretty fast overall.  I would say your best bet is to get pills and make sure you get slow on blaze. Let him initiate, after he spikes and you are still alive his only option is to run away."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,A_Little_Fable,4,Wed Jun 24 08:38:00 2015 UTC,"He meant Rubber Mask, not Loan Shark.  Rubber Mask is a superior upgrade because it will net you easily 500+ solar over the course of the game, while also allowing you to fully build up AA.  Most L1 Vinnies get Rubber Mask at 0:00 before anything else."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,irrzir,4,Wed Jun 24 10:12:41 2015 UTC,"Loanshark is not bad, it is just not common.  You can avoid purchasing cloud entirely for the first half of the game, and can just pump your money straight into Dash damage. If you get an early kill - it's pretty much a steamroll from then on.  Cloud is safer of an option though, especially because of the healing benefits. Loanshark isn't bad for pubs though."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,DespondentDynast,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those solar-on-kill items are good enough picks in pubs but aren't very grand in competitive I imagine.  I consider them flawed in concept since they just seem to encourage killing the feeder over and over for an absurd solar advantage you otherwise wouldn't have."
Awesomenauts,3axabf,Kalazor,2,Wed Jun 24 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"My big issue with picking solar-on-kill items is that they can only help if you're already able to get a kill. They take winning situations and make them even more favorable. What you really need is an item that will help you perform better when you're behind or stalemated. If an item doesn't help in a close match, it's useless, because in all other cases skill difference decides who wins."

Awesomenauts,3axabf,Kalazor,2,Wed Jun 24 13:18:44 2015 UTC,Can we get Bonnie and Needle fan art? I'm pretty sure you can just put some lipstick on Vinnie and give spike a purse. I'd be convinced.
Awesomenauts,3axabf,FrankWestingWester,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Addressing your first point, like everyone below me said. Loan Shark, like Rae's Monkey Hand, is a useful skill if you're looking for that early domination force, but not many people complain about Rae's Monkey Hand or Vin's Loan Shark because they're not op. It requires skill to get the kills required to ensure that you're getting your money's worth. (Or solar's worth.) Rubber Mask, on the other hand, allows you to continuously gain solar throughout the entire match and it's almost always a first upgrade amongst all Vin's because of its landslide ability during early-mid.   Secondly, thanks for the info about the 980 damage dive! I didn't know it was possible, but I'm assuming it's the extra spikes before the dive? I haven't played Vinnie at all after the new update but I remember doing 1,000 dmg with two dives of 500 each. Maybe they've removed that?  And bringing up your last point, yeah Vinnie kinda counters Coco. Sad me. But usually, my problem isn't Vinnie countering me since every 'naut has their hard counters and counterees, but it's more the silence cloud that prevents me from using BL or blaze to either escape or catch up to him."

I don't think its easy to balance. Laser being disabled is another story , it is truly unfair and makes a certain upgrade even more useless."
Awesomenauts,3ast8s,LeD3athZ0r,3,Tue Jun 23 10:51:13 2015 UTC,"Is Vinnie affected by melee AAs in the same way Yuri is? I haven't played him in forever, and don't remember.

Most melees have them, whether it be stunPunch or Tongue or Anchor Drop. The recent Sorona revamp fixed pretty much the only map people had trouble with it on with lots and lots of glass platforms so it's hardly an issue any more. Just treat him like you would a Vinnie when trying to gank him. He's about as floaty in his mobility and so is an easy target for abilities."
Awesomenauts,3ast8s,DespondentDynast,3,Wed Jun 24 14:59:08 2015 UTC,I agree with this so very much. It's a gauranteed kill on a few occassions. Why? because the laser cuts out so you can't even get near enough full damage. You can't run away either because chances are melee characters are faster than you. On maps like the bottom of Aiguillon you probably won't escape for since you cant fight and you cant fly away either. Pick one between laser cutting out or flying but not both.

An image of the getaway scene is considered front page news by the Daily Dugle, but whether the image depicts White Hawk or an accomplice is unkown.   One thing is for sure though, White Hawk is not afraid to kill. Sheriff Lonestar was nearly martyred by the feathered fiend when he tried to stop the crime, saved only by the badge covering his heart, which was shattered by the pinpoint precision of White Hawk's bow.  An apple used for target practice further pins the crime on White Hawk, as does a scrap of White Hawks signature headband at the crime scene.  Whether this winged criminal will be caught in time to restore the priceless artifacts to their rightful home, we don't know.  But we do know one thing... White Hawk is going Down"

Awesomenauts,3apwyn,KEEVAN1234,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:26 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the percentage modifier that dictates how much damage each awesomenaut does to a turret.
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,ol_hickory,14,Mon Jun 22 04:31:29 2015 UTC,"I feel that the fire was a pointless map element The horizontal size is way too huge to not have bouncers to clear the distance or hiding spots to 'bunker' in.  Only 3 creeps...   The Solar Boss is an example of a good map element. You can kill it and it provides something to the teams that might not necessarily be able to contest mid. It plays an actual role in higher-level matches and empowers the player.   I feel like the fire was just filler for 205 because it doesn't really do anything. It might stop a kill or something but that is holding players back, not empowering the user. Even the worm (as big a balance issue as it is) enables the user.   As you said. Slow characters are at a disadvantage because they rely on clever platforming over built-in movement speed values to dodge and kill. Since this map really doesn't have a lot of that - and the distance to the turret is so large, tanks are discouraged from stepping out and are pretty much supposed to farm the match.   3 creeps is a quality of life thing more than anything. Creeps are almost a lane to themselves and to force teams to dwell on 3 is crummy."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,irrzir,3,Mon Jun 22 11:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think you put exactly into words what I was trying to communicate with the solar boss/worm comparison... I feel like the fire is just sort of there. It doesn't add anything tactically to the map aside from ""dont go here sometimes"" and can force slower characters to take the long way from bottom to top, making their map presence even less sharp than normal."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,irrzir,3,Mon Jun 22 14:15:24 2015 UTC,It feels like it should be something to keep track of - and to make efficient use of... but in practice I've yet to see that happen. Even people I consider efficiency-nerds (/u/Kalazor? hahah) don't keep track of the fire because there is almost no incentive to.   This stems from a few things:   The fire is timed Funneling or forcing an enemy into the fire is awkward and unpredictable The fire is confined to mid and loses importance once the first turrets go down.    So we have a map element that cannot tangibly provide damage to the enemy team or help to your team - so it takes on a bit more abstract of a role by determining when and how carefully people will approach turrets. This is actually something that happens but it still has a few issues:   Downward restriction is practically nonexistant. If you are going to block someone from going anywhere: it's up. We again run into the issue of the timer - where not many people actually take the time to memorize the counter. So taking advantage of the incinerator's state is more-or-less up to chance.
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,Kalazor,5,Mon Jun 22 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"Bottom lane is already a very dangerous place to be because you can get dropped on so easily. The fire just makes it more dangerous because now you only have 1 escape route. The perfect time to execute a drop is actually when the fire is up as long as you don't lose too much health going through it. I don't really try to time it, I just pretend like it's always right about to arrive when deciding what to do since it always seems to show up exactly when it sucks the most anyway.  I think if it were more predictable that would be nice. My new idea would be for the fire to stay on 100% of the time with but a raised a bit to give more headroom on bottom so more nauts can do a full jump without singing their hair off. Reduce the damage by half so it's actually possible to go up through the fire without dying. Then Ronimo creates a new ""thermal shield"" item that spawns in front of your turret below the nearby platform. Also, replace the health pack in mid with another thermal shield below the fire centered in the lane. It would give 300 damage shield that lasts a max of 5s that only prevents damage from the fire trap. Have it respawn every 40s or so. Now you have the option to go up without taking any damage. Placing in front of the turrets means it's easier to access when needed, but also makes it possible to deny from the other team.  Although none of this solves the real issue which is that the map is way too huge."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,Xpreshion,7,Mon Jun 22 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's the only map that I feel requires split lane assignments.  It's so easy to get little pushes on either turret.  Just recognize if you have the advantage in your particular lane during the fire, and push hard during the time.    Just be wary of the other team ganking as soon as the fire is over.  For this reason, it's a little more difficult to snowball because you can get kills, and both lanes can get pushed easily at almost any point in the game."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,BexleySmith,5,Mon Jun 22 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"205 is not as problematic as it's made out to be, but it has a few glaring  issues.   Main issue for me is the Hummingdroid spawner. It's downsides leave it as a hinderence more than anything (they drop money too, and if the enemy team can deal with them with no issue, it's just free feed). Easiest option is to remove it entirely, I don't see any alternatives.  Like you pointed out, it's single Jungle is a bit shit too. It gives Gnaw a scary advantage if he controls it, because he's controlling the only health source on the map outside of scarce Healthpacks and healers, his DoT does so much work. The most fun fix would be another shared jungle on the bottom, but the best fix would be little team jungles somewhere close to the tier 2 towers.  I love the Firehazard, but it needs a better indicator for when it's due to go off so teams can plan where they want to be better. It could do with getting stronger in the later parts of the game too, because max health Nauts can drop through it really easily and the game probably isn't revolving around it after 20 minutes.  It's size isn't an issue for me, it feels like a fresh experience from Ribbit because that map is so small. The only part of the map that takes ages to traverse is mid, so if a horizontal team bumper opened up after a turret fell (no idea where they'd put it) but something like that would really help out."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,Handsomeglasses,5,Mon Jun 22 07:55:16 2015 UTC,Love the bumper idea and jungle move you brought up. I think that would really help turn the map around.  Reading all the comments here I think maybe my concerns about the incinerator might be super minor but just compounded by some of the mobility issues.
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,FlawlessHappiness,3,Mon Jun 22 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"It's probably my favourite map. Addressing other's concerns: I think that the incinerator damage is fine; I think that there's plenty of warning -  the rest is anticipating the gaps between fires; I think the thing's you've listed as potential problems with the incinerator are the exact unique elements that it's there to give - blocking off movement: I think that having the hummingbirds is fine - it adds extra push and if you don't want to use them, then don't; I agree that gnaw has a creep area advantage - but no more than on Ribbit; I agree that the map is quite big but it's never been as much of an issue as on Sorona because pushes can be stronger by using the flames early on and using hummingbirds at the right times - they could make the middle section slightly shorter like they did for Sorona; Finally, I don't like that the bouncers send me diagonally half of the time that I want to go straight up as Clunk, but that might just be me."
Awesomenauts,3aoebc,SparCrux,3,Mon Jun 22 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"The lack of mobility is what gets me.  Both Sorona, Ribbit and Aiguillon has jumppads placed almost in the middle, giving great mobility.  205 only allows that when the first 2 towers are down."

Playstyle and Strategy  His passive Shell rage allows him to retaliate with more damage, making him dangerous to chase.  His Shell Spin is difficult to time as it requires groupings of enemies to be effective at causing lots of damage.  Damage against a single naut can be difficult without walls or droids near by.  This makes him more effective in team fights, but weak in 1 v. 1 situations.  The key is to jump into the fray of the enemy team (which is normally never a good idea), so that he bounces around between them.  The speed of this ability makes it difficult to damage him during, but he can be kept at bay with various strategies.  The Hunker Down ability gives him some slight safety while being ganked, possibly allowing team mates to come to his rescue.  Or enemies to come and finish him off!  Also can be used as a tool to body block.  This ability is a little like Vinnie's smoke cloud, wherein, the base ability is not very useful, but the upgrades make it more versatile and important.  Thoughts?"
Awesomenauts,3anr8q,Xpreshion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:29:14 2015 UTC,Oh boy I would play that character constantly if that was a thing.
Awesomenauts,3anr8q,chaosfly10,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe he could have a stance change ability. He could have a slightly faster bipedal stance with AA that do more damage as well as damage reduction in the back. Then he would be able to change stance the same way Ted changes guns, he would walk on all four legs, move slower than any other naut, and have greater damage reduction on all sides, and not be able to jump."

Awesomenauts,3amgos,UltimateEpicFailz,10,Sun Jun 21 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"Well the matchmaking hasn’t changed at all between 2.9 and 2.10 if that’s what you’re wondering. However, IIRC they did move people who were in low league 2 and 3 to high league 3 and 4 (basically expanding the pool of leagues 3 and 4 a bit), so that may have a small impact.   Ultimately, though, you’re probably just having a bad stroke of luck. It happens. Try not to get too frustrated with it, and if it’s hard not to feel salty about it, then it’s probably time for a break.   Also, what Naut are you playing? If you’re having a lot of trouble with bad team mates, you should consider playing more of a hard carry character like Frog, Coco, or Raelynn. Even Vinnie can carry if you get to late game. They can generally hold lanes more easily on their own because of their high mobility and damage output, so you won’t be relying entirely on your team to protect turrets.  Lastly, I would highly suggest using the new video export features in the replays to share some replays. Even though it’s a team-based game, you can always improve your own game, and in some cases carry your team to victory. Share some replays and I’ll try and give you constructive criticism."

Awesomenauts,3aiumz,vonarchimboldi,2,Sat Jun 20 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Thing about it is, I don't know how the community would react to a big patch like that. They already reworked Voltar a lot at first, then just redid him in the last patch, which was a real shock among the player base so as to rework builds and find out what works and what doesn't. I personally play solar cloud Vinnie, and it does work petty well.  However there are a few things going for and against it. Firstly that many vinnie players get other upgrades like invisibility or silencing to go along with size and/or speed. It's the main way Vinnie can heal past creeps and healthpacks with heal on solar, which without solar cloud isnt really the best. And it is such a staple of playing Vinnie really that it kind of removes from his character and backstory as well, Vinnie and Spike are a crime duo with money in mind, so it makes sense to have the solar cloud.  But that said, a few points can be made against it. It could easily be replaced with another status effect like slowing as long as health on solar is replaced with the default. And it isn't his only way of healing what with heal on spike.  Solar cloud is OP in a sense yes. However it could easily be countered making sure your team isn't too clumped up. However the best way to balance it would be to do something like one solar per second per 2 enemies/creeps inside the cloud, or made per every 3.  TL:DR-Solar cloud isn't too OP, but it could be changed to make it better, without removing it."

He isn't particularly OP but his early game is too strong but he's on par with almost every character + the fact that his healbot is in burst now, this usually equals to faster steamrolling. 45 Health early game? Gives the whole team the not going to base advantage. They're able to control the whole map by simply not going back and forth.   He's a healer, I shouldn't be afraid to attack him while he's alone. I'm actually at a disadvantage if I'm playing frog or leon in the early game, tongue him then what? his droids do more damage than my slash plus the explosion burst.  Froggy you can dash him and tornado, by the time you finish tornadoing him his droids already took up most of your health.  And these are in best case scenarios - so no teammates around to help him"

I main clunk and I can still one shot voltar with 1000 explode and a bite which is nice.   A lot of players have said that his heal bot can be easily countered at high level play. I have found as penny I can buy range on my pulse and then simply pulse his heal bot when it drops.   Although for other nauts it's a lot harder to counter. Ok so maybe Rae can drop a time rift on it? But in reality voltar isn't going to drop it right next to you, which means you have to charge it to throw further. At which point you will find it's already been used! This is also the same for trying to snipe it. You almost have to guess when he's going to do it.

Every character seems to have one giant flaw and one giant advantage, which makes each character op as fuck and/or weak as shit(except nibbs). I've been playing for two years and the problems with connection, the the balancing issues just seem so ridiculous. And for an example of one giant flaw and adavantage, I'll use My least favorite character, froggy, he has so much mobility, and that stupid splash dash. But he's squishy, and you have to be on point mechanically."

A character can either be well rounded or have major strongpoints and downfalls.   Clunk is a fearsome nuker with a massive healthbar, but is a massive target and is hilariously slow. Skree has extremely potent abilites, but both are on large cooldowns. Leon and Ayla have laughable early games, but will carry given enough money. On the otherside of that, Derpl and Genji pick up quickly but slope off into the lategame.  This is a feature in literally every MOBA ever, I'm guessing you're new to the genre?"

Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,The_Fad,3,Sat Jun 20 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"L1 frog player here (among other nauts). Here's a typical build.  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Froggy_G/1300201122002010230101321000/1-8-5-5-20-10-13-13-10-25-7-2-2-2-17-9-9-17-23-23-18-18-23-18-24-24  The build order can vary some, but you really want to build damage into dash or nado (tweeters), and not AA (except for the Mutant Worms: Limited Edition). Boots can wait until map opens up, and feel free to replace regen with BKM or piggy depending on the situation. Also nado damage can be replaced by RBAY or CTT depending on the enemy composition (RBAY is GOD-like). I’ve heard ice cubes can be useful in certain team comps, but I’ve never used it.  You’ve said it yourself that the way to win the game is to get stronger than your opponent. Well, the fastest way to get stronger than your opponent is to get solar through kills (without dying). Frog is one of the best characters at that. If you get hammer pants, mutant worms:ltd, and tweeters (plus nado speed) early on, you’re maximizing damage you can potentially achieve with the least amount of solar. However, it takes a decent amount of skill to land hammer pants, worms, and tweeters all in a string. You have to recognize the situation and in which order you should be doing them in. Also, nado has a long cooldown time, so if you’re using it to clear lanes, that’s 11 seconds that you won’t be able to use for a potential kill. My rule is only use abilities to clear lanes if I’m trying to prevent turret damage or if my teammates are not ready to engage in a fight.  General tips for hitting hammer pants and tweeters. People try to twitch tri-dash and sometimes that works, but the easiest way is to wait for someone to jump and tri-dash them when they’re landing. If a character has only one jump, then you’ll know when he’s gonna land. Most characters now, though, have multiple jumps. So what you wanna do is keep doing short hops with frog, until the enemy gets close to the ground, and then you dash in. Jumping a lot with frog is not only a great way of avoiding damage, but every time you jump, that’s a potential time when you can dash down for hammer pants. With tweeter damage, it’s important to know that sometimes you can’t hit the tweeters and the nado (tick) damage. So you will have to sometimes sacrifice actual nado damage, and instead just time the tweeter damage, especially against flying floating characters.  Since you’re L5, there’s probably a lot of stuff I’ve not touched on. How you move as a character, how you adjust your play against certain team composition. How you face another frog. And frog, in many ways, is about playing to those elements to get the most kills possible. Hopefully what I’ve written above gives you an idea for what skills/tactics a higher level player can use with frog."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,yuphorix,2,Sat Jun 20 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"I hover between L1 and L2. Right now L1 with Rae as my most played.  I've played frog a decent amount but all the real frogs can correct my mistakes.  This may not be popular but I rarely get boots and if I do it is later depending on the comp. I also like to rush spin explode damage. It is great for clearing droids and keeping the Droid push. It can also be really helpful for early kills using verticality to your advantage. Drop in while spinning like a clunk explode and dash out.  Piggy bank with frog varies. Since I frequently don't get boots, I get health and regen. Depending on the opponents comp you can either go piggy early or get baby kuri mammoth if they have a derpl or something.  My typical build is both abilities, to spin explode, to dash damage, to health regen, and aa is last. Spin speed depends on their comp. As does shield or rbay. I tend to get shield much more than rbay.  Frog is mobile as hell and good at getting out. Clear droids as much as possible and use stun dash to help your teammates initiate."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,pty17,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"use stun dash to help your teammates initiate   I would be careful recommending that.  Yes this is L5, but an opponent that knows how to react will punish Frog for initiating, especially since he has already consumed his escape tool.  While there are certainly lots of exceptions, I find Frog handles better in teamfights when his allies are already engaged in their active firing ranges before he dashes in.  Now his allies are guaranteed a couple of shots since they are already in range.  Additionally, it is harder for the enemy to punish this dash since Frog would have ideally dashed right into close proximity of his allies."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,dylanw3000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't have to be a straight dash in though. Drop behind them and dash toward your team. Follow up with a spin."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,pty17,2,Sat Jun 20 07:19:15 2015 UTC,"I used to love Frog before I hit my Swiggins phase.  Right now I'm usually Skree because I can't stand the inability to push droids anymore.  Either way, the fact that you are pushing droids as your primary way of gaining solar is a great mindset to have.  However, I think it could be to your benefit to try grabbing shot penetration as an early item.  Frog's base push power really isn't anything to write home about, unless you are willing to burn your tornado just to keep the wave pushed.  Penetration on the other hand is extremely cheap and stays relevant throughout the whole game.  I'm the sort of person who likes to rush my aa on most characters.  I don't know if this would help you, but I'd like to recommend you attempt to rush an aa build on Frog, just for a few games.  In my experience, while my burst isn't there my fights that last longer than one second really make up for it.  Plus, it has effectively no CD while also being increased droid damage.   Trying this hard-core push power can probably let you see the full potential of what pushing can do.  Besides vastly increasing your income, it also generates massive pressure on the enemy so they have to defend and lose pressure elsewhere on the map.  I usually even just stop using my tornado after a point because my aa is stronger (relative to base tornado dps), while also giving me better mobility while I chase.  Okay so this isn't really much of tips on improving your current Frog play, but really I believe that taking the same character and exploring all their options can lead to a much better understanding of them and the game overall.  By only having base splash damage, you learn to appreciate the utility of the stun to let you get your 3-4, 100 damage (all when upgraded) shots off.  You get to see the true power of pushing lanes and transforming Frog from an assassin to a striker (term I made up, means assassin in-out tendencies while having a more sustained damage output in the meantime).  Also, notes about the build I gave you: entire dash row is a placeholder, some games I just run max cdr and slow for max utility, though the burst is just so enticing.  Tornado row is all about making it relevant again late game in the presence of a godly aa, by shifting it from a damage ability to a utility/escape ability.  Note that tornado should DEFINITELY be used early to secure kills, as its damage at base is amazing for the first few minutes."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,dylanw3000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:03:04 2015 UTC,"unless you are willing to burn your tornado just to keep the wave pushed.   When I play Froggy I tend not to anticipate damage from both dash and tornado.  What I usually do is build into one entirely and use the other as utility. So if I'm building dash damage then the utility purpose in tornado is killing droids. I never try to save it for damage on nauts. On the flip side, if I build tornado first then the only purpose of dash is to escape. I don't try to kill with it."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,phl_fc,2,Sun Jun 21 07:45:14 2015 UTC,"This isn't directly what you asked about, but I think it's an interesting perspective to have. When you play competitive games, there are so many things to keep in mind at any one time. An incredible amount.  Froggy is an asshole. He is the only character that has true invincibility, and he's incredibly mobile. If the other team doesn't have any hard CC, he is pretty free to do whatever he wants.  Whatever. He. Wants.  This lets you play the game the way you want to play it. Awesomenauts as a game specializes in its flexibility in character progression. That, combined with Froggy's innately versatile skill set, allows for you to build to counter the enemy team very well. You need to think about the opponent's team, and think about ways you can exploit it. Exploit the living fuck out of it.  If they are squishy, build assassin and burst them. If they are brawlers, build cooldown on Splash Dash to hit and run and evade. If they are all melee, build up your AA with boots and use your speed to kite them. If they can spawn minions or have good pushing power, make sure you build good waveclear. If they have good teamwork and stay together...well you might be screwed because Froggy isn't the best team fighter and teamwork is OP, but one thing to try is building shield and explosion on tornado and split pushing turrets. Etc.  When you play a character, play to his strengths. Froggy's is speed and invincibility. There is no set build path. You just need to examine the situation, and build what needs to be built.   There is also something in your post that I would like to correct, if I may. Awesomenauts is NOT about being stronger than your opponent. It is also NOT about solar. These are means to the end, and that end is destroying their drill. That's it. Getting solar helps you buy items which help you become strong, which helps you get kills, which frees you up to push. Pushing > Kills (This is why I main Lonestar; he can solo push and stop pushes so well.)  tl;dr - Play to Froggy's strengths. Build to exploit your enemy's team composition. Pushing > Solar > Kills"
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,Smooth_One,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:23:02 2015 UTC,"do you use hammer pants? When I started to play frog I just bought hammer pants and spend all my time learning to play with it.  I sucked for quite a while but it was fun. When I could use it well it was so much damage per solar it worked well.  Also dashing into the floor with the stun is a great to tornado straight after.  The nado is another thing that when you hit all of it is just ridiculous, but is hard to do. some single minded practice is what I needed.  Not getting any more that 3 death in a game as frog is very impressive. However i think frog is a character that's strength is shown when played in some way aggresively. Try playing risky to see whether you can get a load of kills, you might just surprise yourself :)   The fact that you value solar, pushing and have a low death count confuses me also, i have no idea why you're stuck in low leagues xD"
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,Andersenio,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"I can't really help with Froggy tips. But an interesting side-note about picking up solar. When Teamxeggs did their solar challenge episode on YouTube to see who could get the most at the end, they had Skree (good at clearing droids and got most kills I think), Voltar (old Voltar generated money per heal), and they had Froggy (running around picking up solar and getting some kills). Froggy easily won in total solar at the end of the round and showed me how important it is to make small efforts to pick it up, even if you're not as fast a character as the Frog. It all adds up."
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:27:23 2015 UTC,"Oldie but a goodie: Triangle Dash  Basically, dash stunlocks. The stunlock is pretty short, so you need to angle the dash in a triangle shape to position yourself for a good followup. Triangle Dash -> Tornado is a great way to get a lot of guaranteed damage.  The main drawback to triangle dashing is that you fully commit both abilities to a single target and leave no easy out for yourself. So don't triangle dash a group unless you're sure you can stunlock all of them"
Awesomenauts,3ahcmj,chaorace,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"Play to push droids, even if that means pushing with low health as long as its safe (one eye on the mini map & no leon)  The most valuable thing about bringing the scoreboard up is checking what abilities friendly and enemy nauts have to compliment or counter act them. Having a bad few games? Next match change your playstyle.  Buy items quick, buy them before you drop if you can after death. Stay in reach of your team for support.  Again, don't retreat too far with low health, at a safe distance, your team mates may need your dash ability to prevent them from dying or for you to clench a easy kill. Cannot stress this enough. Teams lose when they are tracking down health instead of droids, it also disrupts the flow of the team. 3 team members all on avarage health and full abilities are a force to be reckoned with.

Awesomenauts,3afv80,Nemeslime,3,Fri Jun 19 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"This is not a complete build BUT it's a very good start.   http://nautsbuilder.com/#Vinnie_&_Spike/1100120100000110000001010000/1-8-14-24-6-6-5-2  It's a very universal build which works on most if not all nauts because of the high sustain and huge burst. It's been serving me well all the way from leauge 6-1 and it works really well. How to finish the build will vary from game to game but bulding range dmg and speed on bubbles works most of the time, but sometimes it's better to get something like codfather instead of speed if you need that extra OOMF late game.   All you really need to do either finish people off with the spike dive. (There's no such thing as a kill stealing this game in my option. Take the kills can get.) Or spike dive into a bunch of people, smoke  and then fly away while peppering them with bubbles.   The high sustain from rubber mask and solar krab burgers should keep you alive most of the time, if you actively farm."
Awesomenauts,3afv80,Eddiejo6,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:26:04 2015 UTC,This is how I finish it  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Vinnie_&_Spike/1100120110010111203001010000/1-8-14-24-6-6-5-2-12-19-19-19-9-16-17-17
Awesomenauts,3afv80,foobar5678,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:14:06 2015 UTC,"Okay this is what I usually go for. It changes though depending on my team, enemies, or mostly just what I'm in the mood to do.  this is just some general ideas that doesn't really account for your team makeups.  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Vinnie_&_Spike/1100120110010111203001011010/1-8-27-14-24-25-5-16-6-6-9-2-19-19-19-12-17-17  I piggy bank into rubber mask because i am greeedy, then just drop a cloud on some droids and switch to the other lane, kill some droids, repeat.  Huge early solar boost gives me krab burgers and boots early so i can get away from like every fight, heal up and stay in lane for a long time. Dive's for running away (unless you can pick someone off who is running from the fight).  Come back to grab bag full of goldish and/or range. Most people will say ""dive damage first"" but i like range early because, like i said before, i'm greedy and just want to kill droids. it's safer to kill droids from a distance and it also it outranges most nauts and you just poke them a few times most people will just leave you alone or stay on their own side.  remember after you get bag full of goldfish, keep your pockets heavy. it does a shitload of damage to droids and will scare away most other nauts, but spike dive is not for starting fights. it's for finishing them or running away  If the enemy is like a froggy or someone I might grab silence before damage too.  Then when I next hit the store I double up on the chrome files for the damage. With them and a bag full of >150 solar, it's time to start killing people with spike dive. you should have the most solar of anyone in the game since the masked cloud is bonkers, and you can get some kills while you're in your endgame and they are in their midgame.  Hover near your teammates and spike enemies when they stray. speed on cloud can be useful if you're feeling aggressive but i don't like to chase very far because after using his spike dive, vinnie dies fast. so it's usually rocketeer which makes the silence even scarier to enemies and really lets you tell them to get away from you with some ink in their face.  Then it's seahorse head or range as needed (rarely do I feel like I need the lifesteal because of krab burgers and only find myself grabbing it when we're losing) and them AA upgrades for pushing towers to finish the game"
Awesomenauts,3afv80,mnoise,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"I am a decent Vinn player who floats (heh get it FLOATS) around leagues 3-5 and this build usually doesn't let me down (too lazy to get on nautsbuilder right now but I'll probably get to it).  #1 - At the first shop, buy Spike Dive and Solar Krab Burgers. You'll be able to keep your health up with solar and you'll also be able to defend yourself. Farm droids as much as possible until you get to at least 235 solar then go back to shop  #2 - At the second shop, buy Cloud and Rubber Mask. When you place the cloud on a large group of enemies, you'll get solar, and thanks to Solar Krab Burgers, you'll also get healed. This is how I keep my health up through most of the game (unless I'm dangerously low then I don't bother with that, so I just get a health pack/creep). Farm for solar until you get at least 300 solar.  #3 - If I only have 300 solar at this point, I only buy Bag of Goldfish. If I have a substantially larger amount, like say 500 solar, then I buy Bag of Goldfish and Boots. After buying Bag of Goldfish, make sure that you keep at least 100 solar in your pockets after leaving the shop at anytime. You deal 150 more damage to everything if you have at least 150 solar in your pockets, so make sure you leave with around that amount. Boots is just nice to have because speed is nice. Then farm until you have ~500 solar  #4 -  Max out Chrome File. More damage, nothing much to it. So if you have more than 150 solar and you hit a 'Naut, you deal 700 damage.  #5 - Here I buy into the remaining two cloud upgrades. Red Bandana is a must have and a pretty big nuisance to the other team. If I tend to see myself dying a lot, I buy Withered President Mask for that getaway boost. If not, I buy Rocketeer.  #6 - At this point I just buy into Scarfish, Al Carper, and Sharky & Ramona so you have a pretty good AA, dealing an overall damage of 180.  You should also buy pills at some point if you find yourself dying, just try and make sure you don't waste money at the beginning on them."

Banana is a crutch that stomps bad players and just doesn't fly in high-level play due to how bad Yuri's Laser really is."

Awesomenauts,3agn9a,Slevens_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"Let's say its mid-game okay? This Yuri will most likely have the Hubble's Lens and (For the sake of the discussion) Banana Phone. He will lifesteal from you 50's and 60's meaning he will get 25's and 30's as lifesteal, he will most likely live through whatever burst you throw at him during this and be able to shrug it off."
Awesomenauts,3agn9a,DespondentDynast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"It's to prevent animation clashing. Mind that the laser is technically put away to deploy mines or generate a time field.  At this point it's just part of Yuri's skill floor and not really a restriction. Laser isn't like other AAs where you use it whenever. That'll get you nowhere against good players. Its limitations mean you have to be considerate and cautious when using it. It's best used for poking and nabbing coins, with some niche situations where it absolutely wrecks (bodyblock into a turret between facemines, for example)."
Awesomenauts,3agn9a,DespondentDynast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:06:30 2015 UTC,I mean... yes. You are right. But if you play an agressive / proactive Yuri it is sometimes the tenth of a second which makes the difference beteween life and death.   For example I rush in and laser the enemy and then there should be the option to just (on demand without break) to activate time bubble.   This can be considered IMO since you can't move when using the laser anyways.   I feel yuri is restricted enough to give him this little bit of more freedom.
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Deimos_F,3,Fri Jun 19 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"As far as Black Hole goes it's more so being on the lookout to be just out of range when it comes. Most of the time it wont even be fully charged to dish out real damage, it's the OTHER Nauts you have to worry about when that happens. Snare on your Stimpack OR/AND shield may help you out in this instance so you can at least minimize any damage while being caught in black holes if you're unable to avoid them often enough!  Just knock AAyla around. She cant heal off you if she cant reach you. And her healing has been nerfed right below the ""overpowered"" threshold so she cannot afford to be as brave fighting a group of three.  So basically treat her like a Leon and try not to be caught alone."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Nixonat0r,2,Fri Jun 19 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"So if you are using a close range/melee character, is Sentry basically off-limits?  Also, about staying out of reach of AAyla, how can that be done if she is able to outrun you?"
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Nixonat0r,3,Fri Jun 19 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"Only off limits until he lets off his blackhole. If you can get around that blackhole as he shoots it at someone else then he becomes incredibly vulnerable to melee characters since he's incredibly slow and is unable to teleport with constant damage.  If AAyla can outrun you then as I said you simply cannot let yourself be alone in lane with her. Gotta have a buddy who can get her away. That's why she's so powerful in the lower leagues because teamwork is ""less mandatory""."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Caledog,2,Fri Jun 19 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"Since you didn't mention the shield on Black Hole i'm presuming you haven't tried using it for yourself. Black Hole isn't as cheesy as you'd think. He can't just fire it whenever he wants, he has to prep it first by putting a shield up. The more damage he takes the more damage Black Hole will do when he fires it. You can tell when he's got Black Hole prepped to use by looking below his health bar, there'll be a little purple bar that shows how much damage his shield soaked up, so the more full the bar the more powerful Black Hole will be. If you see sentry without the bar, you should be able to engage safely enough but when he pops the shield up, ease off, it only stays up for a second or two and if he doesn't take damage in that time the following bh will be pathetic. If you see sentry with a big fat purple bar, get outta there or you'll probably get nailed. The bar will drain if he doesn't pop his skill so you can just wait him out.  As for Ayla, yeeaaaah Clunk gets wrecked by her but that's just how the game is: some nauts counter others. Most nauts can deal with an Ayla without too much trouble, like Ted can blast her with his shotgun to keep her off him, and if you're really having trouble you can buy extra knockback on shotty to just instantly disengage whenever she tries to go for you. She's definitely one of the best brawlers, if not the best, in the game so engaging is often a bad idea but she's by no means invincible or impossible to escape."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Slevens_,2,Fri Jun 19 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"Sentry main here.  BHS is actually very balanced and requires input of the enemy to charge it properly. Base 605 max is a lot however its rare that he will get that charge early game; need to worry about his team then because its burst on top of burst like a Swiggins Anchor then a Clunk Explosion.  ""Insta-trapping"" You say, well that means he has aimed it perfectly to get you or your team into the eye, when in the eye there is not escape except a Rae Timerift in the center to slow it and nullify gravity or a dash.   If the projectile was slower it would be a serious nerf to his killing power also if there were to be a small delay it would essentially make his new fix void."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,Kalazor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"Black hole is super easy to avoid. Watch out for when Sentry charges his shield, and don't go face to face with him when the BHS is charged. The projectile is actually pretty slow, and if there's any lag that will work to your advantage because the slowdown is based on what you see on your screen. Sentry is a defensive naut, and part of the reason is that it's difficult to approach him when the black hole is charged. That's just how the matchup works. If you're careful and attentive though, it's one of the easiest abilities in the game to predict and avoid."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,yuphorix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"Let me tackle the Clunk vs Ayla issue. Like most slow/tankier characters, Clunk has to utilize spacing and the turret to be effective. This means that you have to have good map awareness for Ayla and recognize when which areas you don't have map vision for that could potentially blow up on you. Clunks base AA is quite good on zoning, so once you get spacing/map awareness down, Ayla shouldn't be able to approach you without taken a couple of AA shots. Minimize distance from your turret to allow you to escape. Only push out further into mid-map once you have team support. A big part of Clunk is getting good at bite, and by the time the map opens up, you should be getting quite a bit of life back per heal to allow you to sustain in 1v1 fights against Ayla. Also, use your floaty jump to air kite an AAyla, as she has a pretty bad jump.  Rage Ayla is scarier against Clunk as the speed increase (plus no collision) and juke potential makes it harder to land bite and explode."
Awesomenauts,3aedsl,aaronnewgen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"Sentry with a blackhole is like a guy winding up his punch saying ""im going to punch you"". It is not hard to dodge,or you could try luring out the black hole."

Awesomenauts,3aak5f,Homem_da_Carrinha,9,Thu Jun 18 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"I believe I have worked out what the new naut will be. First I think that this could be linked to Vinne and spike . on the vault it says    ""When you join the Awesomenauts, you become part of a team. It doesn't matter where you come from, or what your story is. Some have joined for glory, some join for riches. One is about to join them for revenge.""  from reading this you get the instant impression that this character is looking for revenge on an already existing naut. I believe this is Vinne and spike because after reading his lore I noticed this piece of information   ""They are wanted on numerous planets including their homeplanet Okeanos where the largest crime syndicate Shisu has put a reward on their head for stealing the Kullinan Koi""   Now after reading this you can clearly see that Vinne and spike are wanted men and who better to be searching revenge then the mysterious figure ""Shisu” from there home planet. This would also explain  the current teaser on the vault of a whiteboard with evidence written on it and a question mark. Question marks can also be seen in Vinnes and spike cloud after using it. After even further research I realized that the name “Shisu” from Vinne and spikes lore is also a type of dog.    https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Shisu&biw=1360&bih=677&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Aw-DVZugOcnX7Qbhnp2QCA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ  So in conclusion I believe the new character will be calued Shisu whom will be a detective/police dog from Vinne and spikes planet searching for revenge on Vinne and spike for his crimes!"
Awesomenauts,3aak5f,retroXD,8,Thu Jun 18 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"If we're looking at other nauts' backstories for clues, I feel we should also point out that Froggy used to be a gangster, Leon probably has angry husbands after him, Lonestar wrangled an entire species, Gnaw is an omnivorous Skroggle, Ayla violently broke out of prison, Clunk destroyed countless homes before becoming a mercenary, Derpl is the nephew of an interstellar CEO, and Swiggins has a nemesis named Captain Inkbeard.  Also, a potential link is the fact that this patch is called ""White Hawk Down"" and Raelynn used to be part of a covert ops squad called the ""SkyHawks"". Nothing more than the fact that both have the word ""Hawk,"" but we have so very little information at this point."

Awesomenauts,3addjn,mawster88,2,Fri Jun 19 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to build Skree (imo) AA Skree or Saw Skree.  I faze in between these from game t game dependant on what I am facing. So lets say there is a siege Derpl; Saw build, Froggy G; AA build.  AA Build: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Skree/1000000100000010310201301002/1-25-8-17-17-17-28-28-20-20-18-23-23-23  This build focus' AA damage early and will build Utility and AA before abilities. I am not a fan of Skree DoT, don't get me wrong its good especially now it gets affected by SSS but slow is better for chasing as it limits enemy movement and allows you to get close for the saw blade. I also pick up attack speed as a 264 damage per second turret push is very nice.  Saw Build: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Skree/1310100100000110000001001002/1-8-25-2-2-2-28-28-3-5-14  The thing with this build is that really anything except Saw damage is replaceable, I have been told that have dual saws and particle saws works well however I prefer sustain saw with size. Tips for the saw would be to try and get close enough so you can put the saw through them, jump over and pull it back through or just give it enough distance so you just need to do a simple throw and pull back."
Awesomenauts,3addjn,Slevens_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"In my opion it depends on your enemies. If you play vs low-health Nauts, like ayla, froggy, penny etc, im gonna start with aa: slow, attack speed, and damage. The aa is incredible strong vs them. Vs higher-health nauts im gonna, start with aa slow, and then the saw damage. You need much more burst to get a sentry or clunk down. Anyways, you need to learn how to use your totem well. The totem is so underrated. If you have a controlled totem, you have a huge advantage. This thing can be, with the right team, so destroying. Also for pushing, trapping, escaping reasons. And i dont need to mention aigullion? ;) I love the bumpertrap."
Awesomenauts,3addjn,MrNagel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"Regardless if you're going aa or saw, be sure to pick up a rank of slow on totem at some point. It's so incredibly potent and complents very well."

Awesomenauts,3a8in9,Kngrichard,6,Thu Jun 18 02:42:12 2015 UTC,She is still more than fine. Don't worry.
Awesomenauts,3a8in9,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:33:08 2015 UTC,Only reason I said to take particles late is because of the nerf to how you used to play (Which is how I learnt to play Coco to a semi-decent set) and personally I adjusted to early Ball being able to make up for less AA damage.
Awesomenauts,3a8in9,redria7,2,Thu Jun 18 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"People are talking about AA tapping. I suppose if you are top 100 maybe it would make a difference. Or perhaps it is only relevant for that build. Either way, Coco is perfectly fine right now.  My build is: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Coco_Nebulon/1311000123001012200101320200/1-8-4-20-16-16-23-17-23-17-23-26-26-24-24-2-2-2-13-9-9-10-10-10-3. I have been sitting between ranks 100-200 for most of this season after a slow start trying to learn froggy.  Blaze and ball to start are a no brainer. Then save up 300 solar and grab knockback and lifesteal. Lifesteal will not be impressive to start, it is mostly useful for staying on the field and farming, like Ayla's base lifesteal.  Follow that up with max AA damage and a utility row focused around health and you can pull off some insane kills.  Knockback ball is great for keeping people in range of you, or just forcing everyone to back off. Use it for the utility of displacement rather than damage. The damage is just a bonus.  Blaze mulitplies the effectiveness of your AA drastically. A good Coco running my build can out lifesteal a fully built AA Ayla. Use it to keep enemies slowed down where you can reach them.  The point of this build is less focused around getting kills early and more around farming and push. Use it to clear lanes and stay on the field. As you build up damage your ability to poke turrets when you have a droid or 2 skyrockets. With 2 droids you can take out half a turret. 4 droids and you can finish a turret in 1 push."
Awesomenauts,3a8in9,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm well meta has shifted since her nerf or buff dependant on your views, I'd say this is a good build, haven't played her properly since the update: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Coco_Nebulon/1301100123300012200021321000/1-8-24-24-25-2-2-2-4-5-9-9-21-21-10-10-10-16-16-17-17-23-23-23-11-11-11  As I said, have not played her a lot and finding it hard to adjust since we can't Yeezus anyone any-more, but here's a build that focus' ball early. Tips would be don't overextend since she is not as powerful (aa wise) any-more, try to poke enemies out of turrets with ball or just poke them till they die. That's all I can really say, have fun!"

Even touching a ceiling will ruin it."

Awesomenauts,3a47wi,Kaizermos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:37:24 2015 UTC,The game is slightly better balanced than before. New character additions and a slightly different playstyle overall. A few map changes most notably on ai station which now has 2 lanes as opposed to the old 1 then 2 lanes. Nothing to netcode yet but they are hoping  to implement a new matchmaking server to better match players in your region with you.

Leon does the best in late game, and (pretty much) the worst early game. You're wanting to reduce prices to make him a powerhouse mid game, very few will actually be able to kill him at that point, because he has huge damage and it will become rather cheap. almost all of the points you made I strongly disagree about.  You won't be able to learn how to beat a damage machine that destroys droids/towers very quickly"

Awesomenauts,3a37v4,midebita,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"I guess you're talking about Steel False Teeth. I think it's a good idea but that's too much lifesteal. I would say that two ranks of 100x2 would be better, Because 160x2 per stage (total of 640 lifesteal) is huge. 100x2 per stage (total of 400 lifesteal) would be better."
Awesomenauts,3a37v4,floatingfast77,2,Wed Jun 17 07:12:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like dropping the price of his tongue burst damage as significantly as you suggest makes his initiations too powerful. If these price reductions happened, they’d have to get rid of silence tongue, because that kind of initiation, naut displacement, and CC is just insane (especially given how well it comps with everything else and the fact that he can perfectly position himself with cloak).  That’s just me, though. I used to main Leon but it’s been a good long while since I’ve played him. I don’t think the “lower league pub stomping” argument is a good one, but being able to tongue nuke someone even earlier in the game + silence is just devastating."
Awesomenauts,3a37v4,Slevens_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly, hi Yxesca.  I would like to see some changes to his tongue, it's very expenssive. Lifesteal tongue would be better as just an increase in lifesteal rather than have it be in stages.  Blind tongue could be changed to possibly a poison tongue that deals like 100-200 dot.  French baguette does need a buff, used in very few builds and at the moment is not that much of a powerful upgrade in normal pubs.  If you nerf the damage given by Chainsaw (Otherwise it is 280 every second) to something like an extra 50 in two stages and instead of reducing price why not increase the slow by an extra 5%."
Awesomenauts,3a37v4,Slevens_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:11:08 2015 UTC,"The added stage would be a buff. it would cause an increase in price by about 25 solar but would increase amount of lifesteal by 80x2. (I still would rather them change it back to its 160x2 per stage with 2 stages)  Dot tongue would just become another mandatory damage upgrade because, well, damage.  see edit.  Slow is actually pretty strong as is. That's why I only suggest a price drop."

I'll swap out Combustion with Lead Casing as i see fit, and Shield if Deployment Pads aren't required. You can also pick up Fatcat early, because the additional nuking out of siege it gives you is remarkable.  You maybe scratching your head at my bizarre cat build. Because it's late game, and Cats aren't my main get up, you can build as you please, but that build has given me surprisingly decent success. The range and attack speed let you have a stream of cats that's hard to pass without getting hurt, and Fatcat sniping is a thing (trust me ;D).  But no outside of cats this build is pretty scary, would recommend."
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,BexleySmith,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:45:39 2015 UTC,I never thought of Fatcat sniping. That seems like it would be pretty hilarious fun if you're stomping.

I like to build Traps/Nuke > Cats > Sustain > Turret.   By the time you're actually lategame you want turret with slow. Midgame you're better off with cats, mostly because they are absolutely devastating. Our builds are pretty similar, yet you use a very odd Cat build, which intrigues me, but I don't really think I could play that way. I like to be up-in-your-face with my cats."
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,jafel,3,Wed Jun 17 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"I'll do my mains;  Sentry  Build: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Sentry_X-58/1200103132020013002101021000/1-8-24-24-25-20-19-19-16-16-16-7-7-7-5-9-9-9-10-10-2-2-12-12  Reasoning for less popular items and build order:  Build order: I try to be consistent in staying in lane so I get medi-can after my abilities because its a 2000 hp back per minute (Includes base regen) and boots for movement.   I get explosion size because you can stack the AA in front of the turret damaging it, any defenders and droids.  I then move onto buying flat damage rather than buying into teleport.  Swiggins:  Build: http://nautsbuilder.com/#Admiral_Swiggins/1220010120032012300011320000/1-8-24-24-3-3-17-17-17-21-6-16-16-12-12-12-23-23-23-2-2-9-9-13-13  This build is pretty basic except I do not opt for boots as Swiggin's already has great maneuverability (possibly one of the best) so it is uneeded, instead I'll opt for a tactical piggy, BKM or shield, really up to how the game goes."
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,Slevens_,2,Sun Jun 14 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Raelynn   http://nautsbuilder.com/#Raelynn/1220010132001013002011321000/8-9-1-9-9-3-3-25-24-24-2-21-6-16-16-16-19-19-2-23-23-23-13-10-10  This is a pretty standard build but people may want to go for time rift with attack speed a little earlier, which is understandable. But the high range burst is great for early game, so you want to take advantage of that and upgrade it more. Then I go from early game snipe build to a straight aa build because Snipe falls off mid game, when aa mid game is extremely strong.  Scoop  http://nautsbuilder.com/#Scoop_of_Justice/1031200133200013021001301010/1-8-27-25-4-3-3-10-10-11-11-3-10-5-19-5-23-23-23-18-18-9-9-9-16-16-16  (No, this isn't a build where I randomly buy upgrades)  Pretty basic build. Building binding early game can be quite bad and with hammer you can get some easy, spamable poke on the turret/other nauts."
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,midebita,2,Sun Jun 14 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"I play a bunch of nauts so this will be fun! Just take in mind that these builds aren't set in stone and that I adjust all of them depending my and the enemy team's composition. Nothing is set in stone.   My best naut is Raelynn and here's my go to build. I always build time rift + AA first. Once I get HC Bomb, the rest of my upgrades depends on the enemy team. Gryc Lubricator + Damage on snipe is obviously mandatory, but the remaining upgrade depends on the enemy team. If I'm in Aguillon, I'll get blind instead of cooldown. Otherwise, this is a pretty standard build for me. I'm league 2 if that matters at all.  Next up is Coco's build. You might be thinking I'm a bit crazy for not building into ball damage earlier, but that's just how I play her. Getting speed on Blaze earlier really helps me with manoeuvring. I'm the kind of person that focuses on droid kills, so building into AA really helps with that. You might opt for ball damage earlier depending on the enemy team, though.   My Genji build. Building into AA is the most viable option for Genji, and getting cocoon after that helps with getting kills. I might opt for Explosion + Hummingbird Droid + -20% Health for Genji if I want to clear droid waves.   Here are a bunch of builds for other characters that I play (I'm an all rounder, so I know how to play most characters very well). I won't go into detail with them since I'm sorta lazy but you can ask any questions if you need. Here you go:    Lonestar Scoop Gnaw Ayla (yes I'm an AA-yla, don't use this build if you aren't great at utilizing her AA and Evil Eye) Yuri Swiggins Penny Sentry   Just take note that I might grab utilities earlier than what has been chosen in the build. The most important thing when following other people's builds is to adjust to the enemy's team. If there's a Gnaw on the enemy team, I grab regen ASAP, and so on. These builds vary each game but all the upgrades that I buy are the same. You just have to know what to get first and you're set. Sorry for repeating myself but yeah, it's important to adjust!!!"
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,manicmoon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:12:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I am nitpicking but your builds do stray from what one would call meta.  Scoop: Id say dont build Hammer and Bindings together, better to buy out hammer than go into bindings. Personally would pick HP and Spoonman much earlier too.  Swiggins: You postpone your 450 anchor pull till full aa, why? You might as weĺl get that 450 burs then that 200 aa also on the topic of it why not get Poolboy straight after, an early game 850 burst is extrememly strong ....  Sentry: Peraonally I will not nitpick here, I have expressed my feelings about aa lifesteal before now many times. Other than that it would be stronger to max out BHS flat completely rather than building teleport.  Sorry for nitpicking these builds just that they could improve slightly by building specifc items before others."
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,Slevens_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"I don't play Scoop and Swiggins very often, so perhaps that's why my build isn't close to whatever is meta. I generally do max out Hammer before anything else, but I've recently been straying from rushing into hammer and building a bit into Bindings as well since I find Triple Scoop pretty good.   Like I said, I get regen + pills earlier depending on the enemy team. I find that most of the time I don't need pills/regen until mid-late game but that's just me.   I'm not sure I've read any of your feelings regarding lifesteal AA, so I'm not sure what you mean? I usually build into BHS straight after AA but recently I've been getting the hang of telefragging so that's why I've chosen to incorporate teleport upgrades into my builds.  I don't follow my builds to a tee, so my builds will never be in the same order. I should have mentioned earlier that my builds are mainly to show people what upgrades I would get. The order of my builds vary greatly from game to game, which I did mention earlier. Thank you for your input though!"
Awesomenauts,39tqz5,manicmoon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:20:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for your quick response (Sorry for my late one) my feelings regarding aa lifesteal on Sentry is that I do not like the upgrade and feel passive healing (medican) is better and explosion radius would be a better pick.  I understand the building BHS and Teleport together I just think maxing flat BHS damage would be stronger then build into teleport.

Awesomenauts,39t4hr,gooomonk,5,Sun Jun 14 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is, since forever, the solar influx after you join is very weird. They did fix it for when a player rejoins, as it has a decent quantity of solar but when it comes to bots or new players, they get more solar than 4 players, making it higher even than the average.   That's why it feels so overwhelming when the team is stalling and a new player joins them, because they will receive a lot of solar and obviously have more items. I've complained about the rejoin system plenty of times, but people don't seem to identify with it as maybe they don't have as much disconnections or similar. But in a region where Internet is not that good, this happens a lot.   As a support player with my duo or even any team, the new players always get more money than me, even if I'm winning, as I'm the last place in the solar chart."

Awesomenauts,39qb7l,NetherPlebiscite,2,Sat Jun 13 21:09:30 2015 UTC,you still go drones first.  the main difference is that before the patch you went drones first because healing wasn't worth the solar spent. now you do it because base healing is enough even for the lategame.

Awesomenauts,39rmcv,sammy12339,3,Sun Jun 14 02:07:25 2015 UTC,He has platforming issues but is really strong with good teammates. He's not very good without teammates because only his dash is used his AA is more suitable for poking than brawling. He can do his huge burst but then he's forced to play passive support with AA and cloud until the cool down end.

Don't you hate when you 1v1 someone and get them to 1/4 health and they get away? Well look no further that is why Vinnie is a great character, his ability to confirm kills is so valuable. Not to mention he can kill player who are way behind the turret.  On another note, I usually only build his spike dive for the first half of the match. I usually rush damage on spike dive, because when you have an early game 700 damage against a squishy frog, Voltar, Skolldir, or Nibbs, you better prepare to be swimming in solar."

Awesomenauts,39rmcv,austindriver13,2,Sun Jun 14 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"When I played premade last patch, I would play Vinnie with either a gnaw and Ted, or if I played frog, gnaw and AA/rift Raelynn. We usually played where I would initiate and then gnaw would spit so even if they ran and could heal out of our kill, they had to run while rae pushed turrets. Gnaw + Burst staying close together is BRUTAL."
Awesomenauts,39rmcv,NetherPlebiscite,2,Tue Jun 16 08:42:12 2015 UTC,"I like  Vinnie as a character, but Smokescreen is the most problematic ability in the game for a whole host of reasons.   Base Cloud is the worst ability in the game, hands down. (Stimpack is better because it lets you push like mental with Machinegun for a few seconds, so even that is better) The only scenario I could see this being even remotely useful is if the enemy team is making amazing progress with Droids.  Rubber Mask is a passive Solar gaining upgrade, the only one in the game. V&S can snowball hilariously quickly with the greatest ease, plus all the other Solar gaining items (Flashy glasses, Solar Tongue, Power converter, Solar Tree, to name a few) were removed because Ronimo themselves thought they were problematic.  Red Bandana/Rocketeer is broken. Such a large area of Silence in something like Dota or League would be OK, but Awesomenauts is a much faster game where Abilites aren't used sparingly.  The other upgrades on Cloud are fantastic and work around Cloud original purpose; GETTING AWAY. But are often never picked up with the exception of WPM because of how outstanding RM/RB/Rocketeer is.   Otherwise he's in a good spot. He's a solid carry with potent abilites and an interesting mobility mechanic. I do enjoy playing him, a lot. 700 burst right outta nowhere is super nice!"

Awesomenauts,39rmcv,ZubbleTheFearless,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"He's weird, because he's super OP, but you have to go full damage on him because he's useless otherwise.  His burst is easy to land, and his smoke screen makes for very easy escapes.  Especially because everyone goes solar cloud healing and silence.  Basically taking away what little risk there is to using spike dash.  And a consistent 55-70 group burst?  Now, everyone's gonna say there are tactics against this.  Sure, it's easy to bait most vinnies or see the dash coming.  But that doesn't matter, because even though I disagree, vinnie can stall all pushes with smoke screen easily, with, again, little risk.  Add that he has the best AA in the game, means he can harass, but even better, he can clear lanes and drop towers early game with a single push solo.  Everygame vinnie is in, I see him with well over 1000 solar than the next person, because of solar cloud alone.  The only people who don't think he's OP are vinnie players."
Awesomenauts,39rmcv,AirlineFood420,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vinnie player (at least not since new loadout.) and trust me, he isnt op. His burst has gone down from 110-120 (1100-1200) to around 700.  and from memory, some of the dash upgrades have been slightly changed (correct me if i’m wrong) and i think scarfish has had a stage removed (also correct me if i’m wrong.)"
Awesomenauts,39rmcv,AirlineFood420,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"He is alright at the moment, he was nerfed a bit quite a while back :c. Can get out of any bad situation if you are good enough (speed+invis on smoke OP.) His early damage is pretty great, being able to shut carries down fast is great. His AA is pretty good because natural piercing (this makes it really hard to siege his towers.) But, he is really squishy and needs a lot of reliable gold, which is harder to have now that the solar loss on death has gone up.  7/10 pretty good."
Awesomenauts,39rmcv,Harryoson,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"As someone who nearly mains vinnie, I love everything about the character. His movement is great, and just floaty and fun, but not too slow, except for maybe his downwards through platforms, but whatever. He delivers a massive burst and as enormous chasing and pushing potential with his maxed basic attack, clouds are nice escapes for both you and your teammates, and he is just an all around fun char to be and terrifying to play against."
Awesomenauts,39p5cv,BexleySmith,6,Sat Jun 13 11:51:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know how this is intended but this definitely sounds like something we should look into, so I will forward this to our designers. Thanks for reporting!"
Awesomenauts,39p5cv,JoostDev,3,Sun Jun 14 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"I actually would like to see some benefit for himself with that upgrade. Whether its a percentage of hp healed that he gains back or a regen for himself if he hits a friendly naut.  As of now that upgrade is completely altruistic, it synergies only with range and attack speed and basically gimps his otherwise awesome AA. This simply doesnt work outside of premade groups and even then the investment might be too high."

As long as there isn't any lag/glitch at the end of a game, then the natural end for all players is to have the game pause as soon as the solar drill is destroyed. I agree that it would be better - especially for watching tournament game replays, because the sudden end is a bit disappointing - so even having an extra 5 seconds with still characters would be good. Similar to how Dota 2 has a set animation at the end of it's matches (although I don't know how replays work with that)."

Awesomenauts,39s8z0,ChaiB88,7,Sun Jun 14 06:49:30 2015 UTC,"he had some burst potential   That was actually the only thing he was good for. And if your support is best built on burst, theres something wrong.  Now he is way less dependent on his teammates to cooperate, which makes him better for soloqueue and squishier characters. Imho he has a good mix of heal, dps and burst now.  Maybe a little too much support in certain comps though."
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,Gumbink,2,Sun Jun 14 07:11:23 2015 UTC,"Shortly before the patch I began upgrading drone shots more than burst, and I started getting way more kills. It didn't need the buffs it received, honestly. I think his new AA completely breaks his theme as a support. It doesn't heal your own team's bots, it just deals damage to the enemy bots."
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,Flarkinater,3,Sun Jun 14 07:43:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's much better than before! He doesn't add anything to a team? I had 10 kills with a voltar in my last game and most games I have above average kills with him. Yes, he's not the best pusher anymore, but that's about it. All the other changes are welcome and great actually! He's way more fun playing with none of the horrible issues from before. He just used to be a brainless character who just spammed heal all day. He's way more versatile now. I also main Voltar now."
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,whypcisbetter,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:13:15 2015 UTC,i used voltar since the game launched and after all the shit nerfs i am really happy with the changes. he's still not as good as he should be but the first release of a re-done or new naut is always a bit ropey so put the salt back in the cupboard and either don't play him or learn to play differently
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,Axiomatt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely better now, much easier to use in solo play. have you guys had issues with the happy thoughts upgrade? It's supposed to increase your AA heal but it doesn't seem to do anything on my end"
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,chris-customswagg,2,Sun Jun 14 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"I just tried and it works fine here. Are you aware that he does more healing the farther he is from enemies? Happy Thoughts only increases the max heal, not the base heal, so it has no effect if you are standing on top of the teammates you are trying to heal."
Awesomenauts,39s8z0,JoostDev,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:40:16 2015 UTC,definitely didn't know that. So the farther voltar is away from enemies or the target is away from enemies the healing will be increased?

Awesomenauts,39pl05,binarian,16,Sat Jun 13 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"He's messing with you. :P   Four regular new characters: Genji, Ayla, Swiggins, and Scoop. Awesomenauts: Starstorm came out. It's a paid expansion that comes with five playable characters (Ted McPain, Sentry, Skree, Penny, and Nibbs) and a bunch of other side features, many of which ended up migrating to the main game. Aiguillion is a new map defined by lots of narrow corridors and a respawning power-up that grants whoever grabs it about 20 seconds of invisibility. AI Station 404 got heavily redesigned and renamed AI Station 205. The original 404 is still playable in custom games only. Sorona got redesigned to be shorter, less reliant on moving platforms in the air above the bumpers, and to give defenders more options for moving around the map. These changes were not deemed significant enough to split the map into two versions the way 404/205 was. The game now auto-saves replays of all your matches, which you can watch in the replay viewer and export to YouTube. Custom rules have been expanded substantially, and can now be used to create full custom game types. They released the AI editor to the public, which has resulted in many community bots being added to the game. Voltar got heavily redesigned, and is now basically a brand-new character in and of itself. Lots and lots and lots of other smaller changes. Plans for the game's future include a dedicated matchmaking server to help mitigate the lag that occurs in the current matchmaking scheme, a new map, and other whatsits that Ronimo is being sneaky about."

Awesomenauts,39p67i,KEEVAN1234,3,Sat Jun 13 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"Hybrid burst/DPS Voltar is just really powerful. He pokes really well with his healwave, getting close to his drones is going to hurt a lot from his lasers, then max explode damage on drones along with drone count allows you to get 1000 damage assuming you land each one. Albeit that's easier said than done, but Voltar is kinda crazy in terms of damage right now."

Awesomenauts,39p67i,Sweggintons,3,Mon Jun 15 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"Not enough gameplay to really determine much. I'm assuming its third person.   It looks like a generic moba to throw into the fray, albeit with a cute art style and an intriguing gimmick. Xbox exclusive has got to hurt it too.  The gigantic monsters, as I see it, only go two ways, neither look very good. Most likely they're non-controllable and follow paths and action for each map. Not likely is that the monster is controlled. Either way I doubt that the monsters are going to look as cinematic as the trailer showed them to be, and there is going to be lots of terrain clipping, awkward movement, etc.  For Nauts players, I really don't see why we would carry much interest over to this. A few of the chars really seem to be inspired from our game. Specifically HK-206, who's very Sentry, and Wu, who looks like Leon and functions somewhat like Froggy."

Awesomenauts,39ooep,uzimule,3,Sat Jun 13 07:46:53 2015 UTC,"I am re-using a comment I made before. (I'd love to make a video commenting about this) There are a few factors when you're soloing. Keep them in mind or else you will have a rough time.    1) Team comp. If I solo'q Yuri, chances are I won't want the other 2 teammates to go Voltar and Genji. Why? Because chances are we will get wrecked. Yes the combo can work out in certain scenarios....and this brings me onto point 2.  2) Changing and adapting builds. In a given case if I am Yuri, and I see they have Skoldir,Lonestar,Coco I grab BKM, why? Because it means I won't get knocked halfway across the map and it means I can stick with my team longer if I don't get pushed back miles. If you have just 1 build it may work in most scenarios but in certain ones it can be your teams downfall  3) General Awareness. If there is a team fight going on on the top lane you better get your ass up there as you may help, by help I mean help your team escape if needs be or help get a kill. There's no I in team.  4) Teleporting: People simply don't get this one. If 1 players dies on your team. That leaves 2 out, meaning you can each take a lane to defend while waiting for 3rd to come back. But if one of the 2 living teammates teleports back that can cause a 1 V 3 scenario where 1 player needs to defend 2 lanes from a mighty push.... Of course, it's important to gauge the situation too, if you go out and over extend you can expect to be punished by the other team accordingly. In this case try avoid letting your HP sink below 50%.  5) Knowing when to push/roam and when to not: This is a huge factor, this one can get you caught out and often times means you can die because of it. If you're on the enemy side of the map while they're all alive and both your teammates are farming droids near your base chances are they may not be able to get to you / save you if the enemy team decides (Which they will ) to gank you since you're an easy prey(Since you're alone).  Of course, you can't gaurantee your team will be good, but it's also important to remember the 5 points above and stick with your team all the time. Try not to be 100% dependant on your team, if they save you great! but don't expect them to put themselves in harms way if they're at 60% hp and you did something stupid."
Awesomenauts,39ooep,Eternal_Atom,2,Sat Jun 13 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"Follow up on 3: pay attention to the minimap. If you see one of the enemy team approaching your turrets, get in there and destroy the drones before they can do any real damage. It always helps to know where your enemies are. If you notice the whole enemy team is on one lane, and your teammates are doing a good job defending, then maybe try to push, as long as you know you can escape fairly easily.   4 is something people seem to have a lot of problems with. I've seen players go back to base when both their teammates are waiting to respawn and the enemy team is clearly moving towards the turrets. If one of your teammates is down, you're low on health, you have a lot of solar, you know exactly which upgrades you want and the enemy team aren't attacking, then it's probably safe. Otherwise, only go back when both teammates are alive."
Awesomenauts,39ooep,WiseOctopus,3,Sat Jun 13 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"Well I'd say play characters that you know for sure (That if it comes to it) you'll be able to carry with. Personally I play heavy class characters so high burst and carry potential comes built with it. When I look to people in L1, a lot of them actually only play one or two characters however they play them very well.  You could also learn 'nauts movements and abilities to counter them, like timing when to burst Sentry or kill off Clunk.  So I'd say learn one or two characters to a high degree and learn to counter whatever you face!  EDIT: You could also learn to become team captain, helping your teammates by telling them what they should do rather than what they are."
Awesomenauts,39ooep,Slevens_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:52:52 2015 UTC,"Best tip I can give you? DO NOT rely too heavily on your allies. You should trust them somewhat, and help them whenever you can, but having your own safety in the hands of someone you don't know isn't a good idea.   The higher up the leaderboard you go, the less relevant this becomes, as top tier players look out for their allies constantly (normally).  On a similar note, help your allies out, as long as it won't get you killed too."
Awesomenauts,39ooep,BexleySmith,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:04:15 2015 UTC,"And don't be that guy who gets 0 kills and 9 deaths and then blames their team for it. No character in the game relies on their teammates that much. If you are dying that much, it is your fault, no exceptions.   There are a lot of players who just throw themselves at the enemy and then expect their team to show up and save them. If you've managed to piss off the entire enemy team then there's not much I can do to help you. Don't engage multiple enemies if you're on your own. It is not your team's job to babysit you.   For some reason, a lot of Skolldirs seem to have a problem with this, and just in general not knowing when to give up."

Awesomenauts,39oszg,JustChillz,5,Sat Jun 13 08:54:29 2015 UTC,"Coco IMO, is probably as close as you can get to the title ""best carry"". Her only weakness is a mediocre start. She's capable of doing pretty much everything. Easy burst damage, harass, CC, initiation with kb, speed, great AA, defense. She just doesn't have any weaknesses and although she's not the best at one particular thing, she's still a B+ at everything. This is evident from not only her popularity as a solo q character for top players but also her high utilization and ban amount in tournaments."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,yuphorix,2,Sat Jun 13 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"Haha well there is really none, its down to choice.  If you are going single queue you could take any of the following: Coco, Froggy, Leon, Swiggins, Scoop, Clunk  If you are premade: Any above, Sentry, Voltar  But its down to what you play; do you play lightweight characters? or heavy's?  For fast low hp pool: Coco, Froggy, Leon  For tank: Clunk, Swiggins"
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Slevens_,3,Sat Jun 13 09:03:01 2015 UTC,Swiggins is a bad solo que character imo.
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Unicornsity,3,Sat Jun 13 11:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with that, a lot of Swiggins' ganking power relies on him co-ordinating with his teammates to effectively make use of the anchor. Although it is possible to do it without friends, it's just harder. Swiggins has a bit of burst, but I wouldn't choose him specifically for that, although I don't really play him, so correct me if I'm wrong."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Jaspaaar,2,Sat Jun 13 12:05:30 2015 UTC,"Swiggins' solo power really only comes into prominence around mid-game. Once he's farmed enough to get 450 hook damage and a 200 (!!!) damage autoattack (and Poolboy more often than not), he can pop damn near anyone he catches out."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,TheGullibleParrot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"Wow I never even knew his AA damage could go that high, it's no wonder he can compete solo. In addition to his ganking power when with teammates, he seems like a strong character both solo and team-wise to me now, the solo part of which I'd never considered."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Jaspaaar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"The thing with Swiggins is that you have to adapt to the situation, if you are premade then its the burst setup however if you are solo queue then you have to play smart and effective meaning you can with ease.   Personally I find Swiggins easy in solo but it appears that people think of him like they do to Sentry. Sentry can be amazing in solo because it can show the skill of the user rather than great teamplay."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Slevens_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"While i see the similarities between swiggins and sentry, sentry is way superior in solo que. You can safely poke and push, which is way more important then a risky 45 burst, since that burst only becomes relevant once the enemy is either poked to about 60% or bad enough to not punish an anchor hook. Swiggins' push is also terrible; it only comes online very late in the game and you have to build specifically for it; which most people will not do. So you get outpushed if you don't make kills (for which you need poked enemies).  In solo que, you can't rely on your mates to do either push or poke, since most people will just kamikaze for kills. To make up for this, a more rounded naut that can adapt to his team's play is better for solo qq.  Swiggins is stuck in his role; bursty support until he gets carried out of early game. So you doubly rely on your team; to do something with your support and to get you out of early game. Even in high leagues this doesn't work out most of the time.  If you just want 45 burst, why not just play raelynn in solo que? She gets 45 burst for free and it can go so much higher while not being as risky. Even better, nauts like penny, coco and leon are amazing. You can do the big three things all by yourself: poke, push and make kills. I would suggest one of those mains to /u/JustChillz :)  TL;DR: Swiggins is too reliant on his team for pushing, poking and finishing kills to play him in solo que. I would pick a more rounded naut."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Unicornsity,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying as what you see or have played as the majority but high level (Top 500) Swigs can easily do solo queue.  Okay maybe Sentry was a bad example but that's what people have told me when I stream.   Lets start with his push; Personally my mid is where my push is best. He has a piercing AA deal 200 + his increased attack speed making it so he hits twice a second dealing 400 damage to the droid in front. His anchor swing goes through bots dealing 200 out and 200 in.  I agree solo queue makes it hard to rely on teammates. But you see Swiggin's is rounded as he has high base hp, decent base AA and also good starting abilities. In fact I see him as a more eligible candidate for solo queue than something like Coco or Frog.  You say he is stuck as ""Bursty Support"" be he simply isn't dependent on how you play him he becomes a pusher, assassin, tank and harasser as well as support. You may think; this is an unreasonable look at a character however this is what he is. His push is great due to high damage AA, he can easily finish anyone off, he can out tank a lot of characters in the roster and he can harass anyone that gets to close and get rid of chasers.  The thing is, Rae is good, snipe however is one of the most easily countered attacks so yeah. I do agree that Penny, Coco and Leon are good, (because you know S tier's) but I do not agree that Swiggin's is too reliant because its how you play him.  But everyone has their rights to freedom of speech."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Slevens_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"He is bad at push because he has a huge target on his head and no real way of escaping. The hitbox is big and the mobility is bad. Those things combined cause most swiggins stay out of the line of fire until they can do their two click combo. If i have a swiggins on the enemy team, he is probably the one i go for (until late game), because he is so easy to outmaneuver. This forces him off the lane until he has his team with him.  Sure you can build aa and become decent at hitting droids, but every single naut can do that. Just because derpl can buy fat cat or go cat derpl doesnt make him a good pusher, while he may clear droids really fast. Clunk can buy double bite and oneshot droidwaves every 5 seconds. Skolldr can clear droids cheaper then swig and just as fast; but do you really want to build for that? Just so droids die a bit faster?  In my opinion, swiggins is one of the worst, if not the single worst pusher in the game; and if you don't believe me, look at the damage stats in some games. In the end of the game you will see him deal about 30% less damage then most players. He just hovers around a lot, waiting, not putting in dps.  And yes, you can make anything work. Support froggy? Be my guest. That you can make it work for one or multiple games doesn't mean it is a smart idea to pick swiggins if you want a good solo que naut. Swiggins is a reactionary naut; you can't really make shit happen if your team is bad (until midgame, i know). People will probably be very annoyed if you just build auto-attack right off the bat and only push, while they take mad risk to get kills. Just because you can use him for push, doesn't make him good at it.  Sidenote, raes snipe is harder to counter then swiggins' hook imo. To counter raelynns snipe, you have to run in her face with a lot of damage, which takes conscious effort and rae's will mostly just snipe at safe times. Anchor hook however puts you right in the middle of danger and is punished incredibly easily, just by sticking together. I'd say it is almost countered by default unless swiggins has his team with him to capitalize on the hook.  Other sidenote, sure we all have freedom of speech but that doesn't make every opinion valid."

Awesomenauts,39oszg,Slevens_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"Liked to hear your perspective, but i just never have seen a swiggins push a lot succesfully. I guess that doesn't mean it's impossible so maybe i need to try it out and surprise people!  Have a good day, cheers."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,Unicornsity,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying things out of tradition.  Froggy, leon, and coco aren't as bad as people make them out to be.  They are great brawlers, sure, so I guess that makes them good carries.  Clunk is better imo, because clunk has sustain with bite, and can push better than all those listed above.  but requires more skill to be good with.  Rage ayla is still horrifyingly OP and super carry.    But top of the list is Vinnie, who is basically an immortal with the best and most easy to land burst that is low risk, high reward, with the best solar generation (even before leon and rae had theirs taken away), can stall pushes, deals more damage to towers and droids than anyone else with his absurd AA.  Swiggins is also very OP in this regard, not so much that he gets as many kills, but that he can easily trap you with a move that's very easy to use, hard to dodge, has no consequence if it misses, has a huge hitbox, deals way too much damage, and provides easy follow up for the rest of the team to get a free kill."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,ZubbleTheFearless,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"I would disagree about no consequence for a miss on anchor drop... unless he can quickly pick Humboldt back up (risky) it usually means he's got no skills available and is stuck with ink spray, a decent AA about on par with Rae's before upgrades. Most importantly, for enemies with an awareness of the long CD this makes him threatless--they can push the advantage without fear of retaliation until Swigs gets his hook back.."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,ol_hickory,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Skoldir or Coco would be easiest. Rae or Leon also work but you gotta snowball. Lonestar, Skree are harder to play but can also do it.   Burst is a weird way to define things. Technically i would say Clunk explode is the biggest burst."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,MisguidedWizard,3,Sat Jun 13 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"I really have to disagree on Skolldir. He is NOT an easy naut to play, especially once you start going into league 2-3. His punches are the most unusual AA in the game and require good timing and he just doesn’t have that many safe ways to engage the enemy. You’re constantly brawling with Skolldir which means you’re always in the thick of the fight where one mistake (a missed throw, an earthquake in the wrong direction, or simply missing that crucial third punch) will get you killed.  But if you want to play Skolldir, you still should. He’s a LOT of fun, even if you occasionally get stomped."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,floatingfast77,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of just basing this on my personal experience. When i play with my beginner friends i have trouble carrying with gnaw, yuri or froggy, but i can get solo kills, i can make obvious setups for teamfights, and i can protect them with stun punches or throw if they are getting dove on. I agree that skoll takes a little practice to get his mechanics but when it comes to carrying a game with beginner teammates he has all the tools you need."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,MisguidedWizard,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"Firstly, if you play well you can get to the top 100 of the leaderboards with any naut.   That being said, to carry you need a naut that can snowball. You need sufficient damage to be able to solo kill people, and good droid killing capabilities. So, I think leon and coco are the best for this role.   Then again, swiggins is my highest winrate naut, just because of how broken hook dmg -> aa rush -> tank is.   It's much more important to have a carry playstyle than to play a naut that can carry. You can avg 3x the droids of either of your teammates as leon if you just constantly change lanes."
Awesomenauts,39oszg,DocOctocock,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:08:55 2015 UTC,"Leon, Frog and Ayla are the hardest Carries IMO. They all have hilarious burst late game, amazing sustained damage, can push like mental and are impossible to tackle alone.   For Semi/Mid Carries, I'd say Scoop, Clunk, DERPL and Coco fit that bill quite well. Clunk is fearsome all game, but his mid game is truly terrifying."

Awesomenauts,39lorv,TQTEM,7,Fri Jun 12 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"http://nautsbuilder.com/#Gnaw/1020000120010010000001021000/1-8-25-24-12-24-9-9-3-3  This is the foundation for my weedling gnaws.  Overgrowth is amazing early game, but it remains consistently great while brawling.  The most important thing about gnaw is you must, must, MUST learn to juke.  Get up above players, drop through platforms quickly, dodge and dance around them, bait them to waste their skills by pretending you are going in to bite-fight them.  People hate gnaw, and will hunt him down to the ends of the earth.  use this to your advantage and have them chase you around your weedlings that'll poke them.  when someone starts brawling you, throw down a weedling.  Thrown down as many as you can during the brawl.  Juke and avoid every shot.  You aren't trying to land bites, and spit is useful, but the point is to try to keep the enemy in the area of the weedlings you are spitting out.  After this, it depends on who you are facing.  If you have good bursters on your team, get amp damage.  If you are up against speedy, hard to catch characters, get slow on spit.  Extra damage on spit is always useful, too.  If it's a game where I need to keep my distance, I'll get amp damage, slow, and +dmg on spit.  A lot of people overlook gnaw's bite, because it's expensive, but getting attack speed, lifesteal, puts out a lot of damage.  When you get someone brawling you in your evergrowing nest, they'll try to leave when they have around half HP.  That's when I'll spit-slow them, and bite them to death.  But really, you gotta figure out your own way.  Overgrowth is always a good start.  Put weedlings in places where area damage skills won't damage them.  So enemies have to waste time killing weedlings while NOT killing droids (on platforms above weedlings, sperad weedlings out, put 1 weedling in hiding places to give your team line of sight, if you are feeling brave and quick enough, drop weedlings in enemy creep area and deny them creeps).  DoT has it's uses, but it's more a nuisance than anything.  Most people will instantly go healy-spec when they are up against gnaw, but they won't know what to do when you are max out bite and their hp drops faster than they expected."

Awesomenauts,39lorv,Ianoren,3,Sun Jun 14 18:29:10 2015 UTC,"With the timer on them, nests are much weaker than before. It's not a bad thing but gnaws bite is usually the emphasis.

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,Legokun,11,Thu Jun 11 23:13:14 2015 UTC,Only one player went after Voltar and it pretty quickly stopped the push.

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:53:48 2015 UTC,Well full potential being reached at 2:30 min mark should say something...

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,Kalazor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well thats a given , as premades are coordinated and can burst each of the enemy down 1 by 1. In that case voltar would fall fast. But the thing is that he was able to get all upgrades he needed to make his teammate withstand turrets in as little as 2.5 minutes. Its the same thing with ayla and her auto attacks."
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,LeD3athZ0r,2,Fri Jun 12 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Hm... Perhaps. The situations shown in the video was mostly from the back turret. I doubt that someone would get there in only 2:30 minutes.  Maybe the situations was approached the wrong way? In the situations in the video, I rarely saw someone trying to kill the Voltar from behind.   I doubt it is that bad again. I have yet to feel it though."
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:16:13 2015 UTC,at 2:00 min mark you can see that the time of the game is 2:30 at the top-middle.

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:34:16 2015 UTC,First time they had 9 kills to 3 at 9 minutes. Both teams had a Voltar there.  Second time they got 6 kills to 3 in 2.5 minutes.  Both times the offending Voltar was level 9 or 10.  I'll admit the turret tanking is an issue but still you would expect those teams to be owning if they got that many kills in that short of a time.
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,Revoran,9,Sat Jun 13 11:03:36 2015 UTC,"This post made me laugh, his skill ceiling is quite high, personally I premade with a L2 Voltar main and the way he plays it is agressive and smart. How this video portrays Voltar is seriously not correct for high league players only really relevant to L4 and below"
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,Slevens_,7,Thu Jun 11 23:30:10 2015 UTC,There's no way that Voltar should have stayed alive as long as he did. Red team doesn't even seem to be trying.
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,KronK0321,3,Fri Jun 12 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, to be fair, the majority of enemies they were playing in this vid were high L2. I wouldn't be surprised if they had already tried to do something against the Voltar and simply couldn't kill him with his team backing him up.   Except for when they're blatantly tanking the turret from behind, I believe the domination was so strong at that point in the game they could afford to do it."

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,ZubbleTheFearless,2,Thu Jun 11 23:13:33 2015 UTC,how to stop this:  walk around and attack voltar.  The end.  The team just hid behind the turret too scared to use one of the thousand paths to get behind voltar and scare him off.
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,sixpillars,2,Fri Jun 12 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"I actually played 'noob' with this combo two days ago.. (I was rank 340 or so at the time, ~450 now). We tried so many things against this combo to no avail. The issue is if you have one player on your team that doesn't put ALL of their damage at volt it doesn't matter. Derpl's nuke presence and his continuous turret damage is enough to keep you at bay, and after an inexperienced player gives them 2 or so deaths. Shielded derpl + volt heal is almost flawlessly set in stone - they need 2 bots to take a turret and suffer minimal damage."
Awesomenauts,39ihy7,Kalazor,8,Fri Jun 12 09:01:31 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is that it's very difficult to beat a team that's working together unless your team works together.

Awesomenauts,39ihy7,inuizzy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:45:15 2015 UTC,An easy way to fix this from a game design point of view would be to add a stacking de-buff on the player getting hit by the turret that would increase the damage the turret did to that player over time. Haven't played since the new voltar updates so I'll have to check him out myself.

Awesomenauts,39guyv,BexleySmith,2,Fri Jun 12 07:23:47 2015 UTC,"When you're hovering, and Voltar's head has contact with a Ceiling, his AA hits the ceiling and does nothing.

Edit: It's drastically reduced the amount of times it happens, but very, very rarely still does it (to the extent where you almost have to time it for it to not work). It's in a state where it needs no immediate attention now, as failing to launch one Wave isn't gonna be game changing."

Scoop -Fixed that Hammer of Justice didn’t deal damage to turrets and the drillcore (and still bounces)   Why did you revert this??? This was one of the best balance fixes you did and now you're calling it a bug?!! This would have prevented so many horribly lame strats that people do with scoop."
Awesomenauts,39guyv,whypcisbetter,8,Thu Jun 11 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"It simply was not intended, we just wanted to change the bounce. Also, note that we have also seen a LOT of posts from angry people that his damage had disappeared, saying exactly the opposite of what you are saying."

Awesomenauts,39guyv,Kalazor,15,Thu Jun 11 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yuri and Derpl can outrange turrets. Loney can drop Trinimite (with DoT) and Bull with Charger every 6.5 seconds. Froggy can pop Reflect Nado and Dash away to poke relentlessly. Leon can spam Clones to spam turrets.  If anything a slight nerf to his Hammer damage on turrets/drill would be fine, but not taking out the damage entirely!   As copied above."
Awesomenauts,39guyv,Cloftos,6,Thu Jun 11 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Its a TINY amount of damage and its not the easiest thing to apply to turrets. The damage only got applied when the turret was in ""take damage mode"" (dealing damage to something) so the only way to use hammer to damage the turret was to dip in, let the turret hit you for more than you deal to it just so you can get a tiny amount of damage. Only really useful if the enemy team is INCREDIBLY turtly. But beyond that it wasn't that useful."
Awesomenauts,39guyv,Iyashii,3,Thu Jun 11 20:12:02 2015 UTC,It was a lifesaver at times on the old Sorona.

They never said it wasn't suppose to deal damage; they said it will now bounce off turrets and core.  I mean I can understand how it could be spamy, but so can a lot of other skills as well. After playing with no damage on it against turrets I am glad it was a bug because it wasn't nearly as fun."
Awesomenauts,39guyv,whypcisbetter,-2,Thu Jun 11 17:37:40 2015 UTC,What else does so much damage to turrets from that kind of a distance. Especially with range!

Ayla, who can turn her Evil Eye into a stupidly spammable nuke that also deals DoT. Genji, who can nuke, DoT and gangbang the turret to oblivion. Clunk, who eats turrets for breakfast."
Awesomenauts,39guyv,Homem_da_Carrinha,0,Thu Jun 11 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"All characters can obviously deal damage to turrets, so what you saying? None of them can do it from that kind of distance and speed while staying so safe.   Pop reflect? Are you aware how situational that upgrade is and how much risk you take being snared at the turret, not to mention the cost? Leon's clones are mindless and have to get through all the droids and nauts first before getting to turrets. All your examples are pretty weak compared to Scoop's hammer which is immediate damage from far way that CAN'T be countered!"
Awesomenauts,39guyv,whypcisbetter,4,Thu Jun 11 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"There is a minimum distance needed to proc the turret in order to do damage. The distance the hammer can go is far more than the distance needed to proc the turret.  That means that all Nauts have to be within the same distance in order to damage the turret. Scoop's range on hammer means little when you have to be within turret firing distance.  For your points:   All characters can obviously deal damage to turrets, so what you saying? None of them can do it from that kind of distance and speed while staying so safe.   Lonestar: Toss Bull w/Charger and Trinimite w/Incendiary for over 500 damage. He can do it from a safer distance because he can have Bull proc the turret and use bounce on nades.   Ever have an enemy Froggy constantly reflect your turret and dash away the entire game? Or have an enemy Leon just spam clone army to demolish turrets and escape with invis? My point is that there are Nauts who can do more damage and escape better than Scoops hammer can.   All your examples are pretty weak compared to Scoop's hammer which is immediate damage from far way that CAN'T be countered!   As I said Loney can out damage Scoop on turrets. I don't have all the damage data on the other Nauts to get a real numbers. As for a counter Froggy can reflect the hammer back. It may be the only counter, but it's there nonetheless.  I want to reiterate that an enemy has to be within a certain distance of the turret to proc it's firing before they can even damage the turret. I feel as if you are not taking this into consideration. Also wouldn't a simple nerf to turret/core damage on hammer satisfy any OP complaints?"
Awesomenauts,39guyv,Homem_da_Carrinha,2,Thu Jun 11 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"Considering on small maps like Rib and Agui Ted can use his FULL aa to attack turrets from relative safety, scoops hammer isn't exactly as damaging as you might think. And honestly if you're concerned with spammy things hitting turrets for ""cheap"" damage you might want to focus on Lonestar. He can sit in the center of a lot of maps, use the bull, deal explode damage to turret that's basically unstoppable and activates the turret's ""not invincible"" mode because the bull can take damage."

Awesomenauts,39j0f2,gooomonk,7,Fri Jun 12 01:35:38 2015 UTC,Almost always damage. Take a look at the values and solar costs. They should be determining your selections
Awesomenauts,39j0f2,shmoozey,2,Fri Jun 12 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"In terms of numbers, yes. Damage is generally better. However, you are also right about the cost being an indicator. For example, Derpls attack speed upgrade is more expensive then damage because cats become an effective deterrent/ area denial, and also helps land more hits, which can be more useful then damage."
Awesomenauts,39j0f2,jSpazzoid,2,Fri Jun 12 03:07:07 2015 UTC,Well for Derpl cats you go bat cat into attack speed into more damage because that is the most effective order of upgrades for maximizing solar spend.   Again there is no order but do the math and just see what effect damage per second upgrades you will get for each selection at which point.  On most jays damage into attack speed is the right order
Awesomenauts,39j0f2,shmoozey,4,Fri Jun 12 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Damage is better, usually.  Using AA slows your movement, and damage has a larger gap between those slowdowns than attackspeed. You also can't get a 'lucky shot' with attackspeed.  Attackspeed is usually more cost effective though."
Awesomenauts,39j0f2,irrzir,2,Fri Jun 12 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"Compare numbers, take voltar. He's AA is 40 dmg, the dmg upgrade is 20 dmg. So that's a 50% increase. His speed upgrade is 10%, so that's a 10% increase.   The other thing to consider is think of how many times you just poke your opponent with one AA. AS isn't really a factor there but an extra 20-40 dmg every once in a while can add up."
Awesomenauts,39j0f2,StagemasterK,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"in terms of DPS, damage is usually better, except for Sentry.  But attack speed has benefits that go beyond simple damage.  Range characters get more chances to land attacks.  AAs that have debuff or lifesteal.  Or just unique AAs that benefit from more shots (skree, Sentry)."

Awesomenauts,39i179,Kithsander,2,Thu Jun 11 22:46:51 2015 UTC,Any idea how to reproduce this? Is it with a specific combination of upgrades?
Awesomenauts,39i179,JoostDev,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:16:22 2015 UTC,I think it has to do with the -2 second cooldown upgrade. Cause I was in a match with that upgrade and my icon disappeared after using it once.

Awesomenauts,39mjeq,froggygguy,10,Fri Jun 12 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"You complain here almost weekly about problems you have with the game yet you always brag about how you're L1, feels somewhat ironic.    Anyways, I like the Sorona changes. I feel like they make pushing the final tower much easier, and the reduction in length makes it so that pushing the first two turrets in the early game is actually possible. Also, the new stationary platforms makes travelling on the upper parta of the map a godsend for slower nauts with poor jumps.    I also don't understand how you constantly hit the middle rock on Sorona from the jumppads, I feel like I have a lot of control where I go when I use them. They can both be used to launch yourself sideways on the bottom lane, or high up and out on the top lane. It creates good mix ups on getting away, and allows neat strategies and fast initations on both lanes."
Awesomenauts,39mjeq,KEEVAN1234,-5,Fri Jun 12 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"What? What does me being L1 and me complaining the game have anything to do? Look, hit the sorona bouncepad (from bottom lane near turrets), and dont touch WASD. Normally, you would just bounce up smoothly. With the map being shorter, you almost always hit that rock on the middle top that binds the platforms together."
Awesomenauts,39mjeq,Slevens_,4,Fri Jun 12 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"That's a problem you are facing, because you probably relied on the bigger Sorona, but 'Nauts is all about change so get used to it."
Awesomenauts,39mjeq,KEEVAN1234,5,Fri Jun 12 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"You play the game a lot and put up with these ""problems"", they're not as major as you think they are. Also nice job changing from always in your main post to being almost always now for hitting the platform."

Awesomenauts,39gy2z,popuptwo,2,Thu Jun 11 17:22:49 2015 UTC,Awesome job! This really helped put things in perspective :)
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,youngzelda,7,Fri Jun 12 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that the problem here might actually be you? Since I started playing, I've gone through hating pretty much every naut because I didn't understand and kept getting beaten by them, automatically just throwing my arms up and going ""OH TOTALLY BALANCED NOT OP, WHAT A GOOD GAME.""  But once you LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of nauts you're fighting, you'll learn how to counter them.  Personally, I feel Raelynn is one of the better balanced nauts right now. Her biggest advantage is big ranged poke damage and the trapping potential of the rift. Her downsides? A small health pool is her biggest disadvantage and without her abilities she has nothing to do but run for most of the game.   Gnaw by default is annoying to fight but thats just it, he's only annoying. His DoT damage can be negated by regen and health packs. He can brawl but has very little range and has little to make you back off if he's low.   What I'm saying is: Try playing these nauts. Seriously. UNDERSTAND what makes them tick and you'll know how to create and exploit oppertunities to counter them. You'll experience their weaknesses and strength first hand, giving you the knowledge of when an enemy player might try and press the advantage or back off as their at the disadvantage, giving you the oppertunity to advance.  As well, consider the problems the naut you're playing has. Some nauts by default will have a harder time fighting other nauts, thats simply the way it is."
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,DamagedToaster,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"UNDERSTAND what makes them tick and you'll know how to create and exploit oppertunities to counter them.   100% agree.  I used to hate playing against Genjis because they'd beat the shit out of me. Then I started playing him once in a while, learned his patterns and abilities, and suddenly Genji is much less of a problem when I'm facing him."
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,TheWhitestGandhi,15,Sat Jun 13 08:12:42 2015 UTC,"I've played so many games lately against a Raelynn that I'm going crazy   Maybe you have played too much in general lately. Grab a snickers and play something else for a while.   I hate her so much.   I bet she doesnt like you either.   Every fucking game it's 3-2-1 or Do You Feel Lucky Punch and then 750 hp gone!   Thats a nice description of her ability. She has a nice amount of burst while being locked into place which is her disadvantage. Also many other nauts have similar or even higher burst damage abilities with risks of their own.   Jesus christ, I bet if she was a male character nobody would pick her!   I disagree, she is a balanced and powerful character and thats the reason she is played a lot. I dont think her appearance attracts that many pubescent players because she isnt clothed particularly sexy in skimpy clothing like many characters in comparable games.   Also I've been seeing Gnaw lately since 2.10, what gives?    Gnaw is an easy naut to play and he received a pretty neat skin. So the influx of players are probably the ones that test if Gnaw suits their playstyle, because they want to use that awesome new skin.   I really hate how much damage over time he does with AA   Gnaw is only really good early to midgame and drops severely afterwards (also gets countered hard by CC). His AA does very little damage over time compared to his spit, so you might have mistaken something (probably the combined damage from spit and AA) and his AA build on direct damage does way more DPS than the damage over time. You can always pick regen against gnaw which sucks pretty much for him.   Can we nerf them to the ground or something?   No. They are pretty balanced except for gnaw in my opinion, which could use a slight lategame buff and a slight early game nerf. As a counterproposal, you could just get better at the game instead?  PS: Thank you for the spices, my eggs tasted bland without your salt."
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,Gumbink,5,Fri Jun 12 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"Rae was already nerfed pretty hard when they reduced the damage abilities did to bots, her solar gain is nowhere near where it used to be. She's also super squishy. All you need to do is wait for snipe to fire, then get close. Timerift doesn't hurt much if at all early game, and her AA is also useless until mid-late game. If Rae is giving you that much trouble, you're either not playing smart or she's got a great team backing her up, she's not hard to counter.   I say all of this as someone who mains her, usually in high league 2. Nerfing a character into the ground isn't a good way to balance things, ever, especially just because you can't counter them."
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,TheDrellAssassin,3,Fri Jun 12 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"Everyone picks rae because she's simple and easy and strong.  She isn't super OP, but she's up there.  Her being a girl isn't the issue here.  Snipers are always the cool and edgy pick in games.  Gnaw is also a simple naut to use, so he has that appeal.  but he isn't OP.  He's also strong early game, but easy to counter as the game goes on.  Also, you have a Vinnie flare.  You aren't in a position to talk playing who is now the most OP naut in the game.  I bet you use solar cloud healing, silence cloud, and 70 damage spike dive with increased radius.  The OP Standard."
Awesomenauts,39l4ze,ZubbleTheFearless,3,Fri Jun 12 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"Gnaw's in a really bad spot right now. Weeds are hilariously difficult to set up against good enemies and it takes so much effort to accumulate part without Overgrowth (which is basically mandatory considering the puny time limit on weeds). DoT is cancelled by any and all healthpacks, including Genji's Moon Nectar and Ted's Hamburger Phone, and Scoop's Holy Cup cleanses in an AoE for 90 solar (it's literally the cheapest non-solar related item in the game).  Rae's pretty strong to be fair, but not hard to work around outside of AI205's mid section.  To answer your question, lol nah"

Awesomenauts,39idhw,Slevens_,2,Thu Jun 11 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"Numbers wise she is exactly the same. Damage was halved and attack speed was doubled.  Here's the math:  Lets just assume that attack speed x damage =dps (Attack speed isn't attacks per second but it works the same either way)  100 attack speed, 50 damage = 5000 dps  200 attack speed, 25 damage = 5000 dps  Ok so the math works out with the base attack lets add upgrades:  Attack speed only:  (100 attack speed * 1.2) * 50 attack = 6000 dps  (200 attack speed *1.2) * 25 attack = 6000 dps  Damage Only:  100 attack speed * (50 + 20 attack) = 7000 dps  200 attack speed * (25 + 10 attack) = 7000 dps  Both:  (100 attack speed * 1.2) * (50+20) = 8400 dps  (200 attack speed * 1.2) * (25+10) = 8400 dps.  Obviously the numbers are made up she doesn't have 8400 dps, I was just proving the math concepts  Her damage output is exactly the same. The only difference is that she might be able to land 1 extra tick of damage to you before you run away.  To the person below: Coco has always had the ability to take down a tower faster than Ted. Ted has the highest starting dps but Coco eclipses it very fast, especially if you get the upgrades that make you do extra structure damage."
Awesomenauts,39idhw,pmj714,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:01:02 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks for the maths, I just felt like her AA overall was more powerful but this says otherwise, I'll stick t your maths then:D"
Awesomenauts,39idhw,Kalazor,3,Fri Jun 12 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"Knowing that the DPS is exactly the same, it's actually a nerf for two reasons:   Less bursty. There's less oppoortunity to move quickly in and out. Also, tapping AA to move faster will actually reduce your DPS where it did not previously. Genji now counters Coco with Bronco Yeast. Bronco Yeast gives a flat damage shield of 30. Coco's AA can now only do a maximum of 45 dmg per hit, and super conductor particles could only do 40dmg per hit before. So  Genji can reduce her maximum AAA damage by 75% with Bronco Yeast alone, not even counting his 25% shield applied after Bronco Yeast. Bronco Yeast also greatly reduces DoT damage so it affects blaze as well."
Awesomenauts,39idhw,poongoolie2,3,Fri Jun 12 14:38:56 2015 UTC,"This is obviously a change to stop coco from click attacking without losing speed. Well, I haven't tested it but it seems like it would be too fast to click attack quickly enough to not lose dps now."
Awesomenauts,39idhw,Doom4d,0,Fri Jun 12 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"Coco is a pusher, brawler, and nuker all rolled into what is supposed to be a harasser. Balance-wise, she is a mess right now. I wouldn't be surprised if she destroyed turrets faster than Ted."

The question that you can ask even the best players (ask around on the twitch steams of Harry or Whoophee or whoever) and not get an answer is ""who exactly is Coco's counter?"" the closest answer is Leon with silence.

Awesomenauts,39ctvs,GabboDk,6,Wed Jun 10 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"Except that that is a Voltar who maximized his AA's healing.  This works fine and dandy until any of the enemy team rolls up on you, in which case they will beat out your healing in almost all cases.  Voltar can outheal the turrets, but if the enemy team is doing its job and defending, you won't have as easy a time with it."

They were quick to fix any characters that could hit the turret from a distance (like derpl) and made sure no dmg could be dealt unless the turret is shooting something.  Voltar is cheating."
Awesomenauts,39ctvs,Zackcid,3,Thu Jun 11 07:23:26 2015 UTC,He does heal too much. After we (The people in the gif) killed the turret we just tanked the enemy team for like 2mins while hitting the core... Even I who play alot of Voltar thinks he heal too much xD

Actually in LOL you can build Xin Zhao and probably Irelia to be able to solo a turret without dying. You'd just never do it because they'd be useless.   I don't know much about Dota2, but in LOL with the right build and teamcomp, you can definitely burn down an undefended turret while tanking its damage."
Awesomenauts,39ctvs,OperIvy,2,Fri Jun 12 05:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with Voltar used to be that he was op in some comps and up in others. Now he might be a bit weaker that he was, but he's more balanced. Still, it's really hard to play against him, a scoop and a genji..."

Awesomenauts,39blyk,hootsboots,11,Wed Jun 10 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Patch 2.10 10-6-2015 Formatting credit: /u/Kalazor   Voltar and Sorona reworks!  Both Voltar and Sorona got a big rework this patch! Especially Voltar is a New Man (tm) now! See the notes below for detailed information.  NEW unique skin: Gnariachi  Legend speaks of a Skroggle that once ate an entire mariachi band. Though fulfilled, he never felt the same afterwards. Mariachi never dies. Gnariachi was born. This is a paid DLC and comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for weedlings.  NEW skin: Voltar Bonaparte  The death of Napoleon has always been shrouded in mystery: he vanished from history in 1821, and was never seen again. In 3521 we finally learned the truth of what had happened. He had the technology. He had remade himself, ready to start his conquest in Awesomenauts. This is a paid DLC.  NEW announcer: The Scrolls of XiPang  And behold! The king said, build me a palace of splendor, for it pleases ourselves and our queen. From that day, the land was sapped of its riches. The king gathered also the ire of his people, who rose up to besiege the palace. Thus started the age... of strife. This is a paid DLC.  NEW: Kill-cam reel in replays  You can now switch the replay to a mode where you see a summary of the match, showing only kills and turret kills.  NEW: Replay-to-video conversion  You can now let the game convert your replays directly to video. The process takes a while, but if you have a fast computer it will be a lot faster than standard video capturing and you can capture on much higher quality (even 4k 60fps). (This feature is Windows and Mac only.)  NEW art in menu   Created new art for the big game mode buttons Added three more characters to the main menu art, on a random rotation with the old three Updated the art style of the main menu background for More Cool (tm) and to be a better fit for the Awesomenauts style   NEW: Borderless window full-screen option  Added borderless window full-screen option to the launcher. This behaves like full-screen but is much faster at alt+tab and does not suffer from the issues some drivers had with alt+tab. (This feature is only on Windows, not on Mac and Linux.)  Network   Fixed that receiving corrupted packets could sometimes crash the game Fixed that damage was sometimes applied twice when the internet connection was really bad   Bots   Removed Penny bot from the game as she wasn’t good enough compared to the other bots. She might come back later if the modding community creates a better version. Updated the bots for Ayla, Derpl and Swiggins with improvements made by the community. If you find issues with any of the bots, please report them in the topics linked here. Fixed pathing issues between the Solar Drill and the Shop, causing bots to sometimes get into a loop there.   Sound   Sounds that have several variations now won’t randomly play the same sample several times in a row. This is especially noticeable in voices like taunts, where characters won’t repeat the same taunt twice immediately after each other any more. The Private Mels skin for Lonestar now has a more fitting revolver sound for his gunshot. Sentry’s voice is made 10% softer to be in line with the volume of the other characters Swiggins’ voicelines when using skills now play less often   General   Improved performance on Windows. How much greatly depends on the computer as this only optimises the processor side, not the graphics. On the computer we measured on the framerate improved by 14% during gameplay. This improvement probably has no effect for players whose videocard is the bottleneck. (This is the same optimisation as was in patch 2.9.2 shortly and the bug with the fullscreen flashes should be fixed now.) Improved the spacing between characters in the font. Due to a bug the distance after a short letter (like i) was shorter than the distance after a wide letter (like w). Fixed that Roboscoop icon was pink in replays whenever Roboscoop was dead   General gameplay   Fixed an issue where solar krab burgers and space air max would switch places in the store. Fixed an issue where players were able to wedge themselves into the droid spawners. Wraithstone and barrier magazine will now also have fixed prices when this function is turned on in custom games. Droids now prioritize enemy droids over enemy nauts, when choosing a target. Droids should now have less issues with jumping over each other and finding their target. Fixed an issue where the spawning of droid waves could desynchronise per team. Droid waves will now always spawn at the same moment for both teams. Cocoon, Voltar Drones and Airstrikes now don't affect skills anymore that depend on others being near. For example, Ayla's Rage damage is not increased anymore if a cocooned enemy is near, while it still is for any normal enemy that is near. Fixed that turrets and droids could steal your kill, making the Solar drop on the ground. Now if a turret or enemy is killed by a turret/droid just after you hit it, you get the Solar automatically. Escaping the drop pod landing area by flying upwards is now impossible. All melee attacks from nauts will now prioritize other nauts first, then droids and then buildings.   General balance   Barrier magazine price reduced from 110 to 90 Solar per stage. Wraithstone price reduced from 155 to 120 Solar. Wraithstone health drop increased from 200 to 300.   Aiguillon   Lowered the glass platforms behind the back top turrets and added a platform there Replaced the moving platform in the neutral areas with two static platforms Fixed an issue where players would sometimes receive a knockback when one of the top turrets was destroyed.   Ribbit   Moving platforms in the mid area are now static.   Sorona  The ground rumbles and rocks shift as the earth comes to life as a rare phenomenon occurs over Sorona’s battlefield: a long awaited nightfall. Due it’s two suns there is a rarely a time without their scorching heat, so when a night dawns over Sorona’s sands the worms inhabiting the earth gorge themselves on the cool surface-rocks. Sorona has received some big changes, including a reduction in size: the mid area is about 10-20% smaller now. Also the maximum flying height has slightly been reduced and there is now a road from the neutral area to the area behind the front turret. Also some new platforms are introduced and locations of solar and health orbs have been altered. This design should reduce the funnel at the end of a game on Sorona and reduce overall game time on this sandy map. We also removed some Solar from the worm location to reduce farming situations."
Awesomenauts,39blyk,Aviakio,7,Wed Jun 10 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"Ayla   Hungry Zurian lifesteal reduction from 20% to 15%. Fixed an issue where quickly turning rage on, off and on would cause weird cooldown and shutdown behaviour of the skill. Rubberband ball now shows the attack speed in the description. Sonic listening device health drop increased from 200 to 300. Sonic listening device price reduced from 160 to 120 Solar.   Clunk   When Clunk gets hit with Genji’s cocoon while exploding Clunk will no longer receive the explode’s self damage.   Coco   Shock attack speed is now doubled and the damage divided by 2. Static gloves damage reduced from 20 to 10 per stage.   Derpl   Brim force field replaced with pussycat album which caps high incoming damage back to 450 damage.   Froggy G   Fixed issue where dash would sometimes get cancelled while there was no wall or other obstacle in the way. Is now able to dash while snared, Froggy still can’t move but he will be invulnerable and deal damage while dashing. If Froggy receives stealth while already in whirlwind or dash it will now properly break the stealth.   Genji   Fixed an issue where the animation length of cocoon wasn’t consistent with the actual duration of cocoon. Improved the jump logic for genji when jumping close to the ground, avoiding Genji floating right above a platform while you wanted to jump.   Lonestar   Fixed grenade trajectory not pointing in the actual throw direction when walking in the opposite direction. Fixed grenade trajectories not showing actual point of collision when throwing against turrets or heroes. Dark matter flashbang has been replaced with Bovinian postcard which reduces the cooldown of dynamite throw with every hit of your blaster by 0.1s (2 stages for 140 Solar per stage). Cattle rebooter price reduced from 160 to 135 solar.   Nibbs   Autographed picture of Voran price increased from 170 to 180 per stage. Autographed picture of Voran damage reduced from 7 to 5 per stage. Darkenstone price reduced from 170 to 155 per stage. Eye of Coba price reduced from 185 to 170 per stage. Firebreath base damage increased from 15 to 17. Sunscreen mouthwash effect has been replaced and now increases the duration of firebreath by 0.5s. The teleport icon of orb of Omicron now has a working tooltip. Red sneakers will not work anymore during firebreathing. Chocolate monster egg shield increased from 11% to 15%. Orb of Omicron will now bounce off of turrets and the drill core. Firebreathing will now keep Nibbs’ double jump when not used before using firebreath, so when you are firebreathing while flying you can jump afterwards.   Raelynn   Snipe and timerift will now only slow Raelynn’s speedup effect down when actually used and not when they are on cooldown.   Scoop   Snow shovel price reduced from 195 to 145. Milk of the righteous price reduced from 190 to 145 per stage. Titanium coneshield now activates at 70% health instead of 50%. Halberd of justice increased heal from 30% to 50%. The holy cup price reduced from 115 to 90. Hammer of justice will now bounce off of turrets and the drill core.   Sentry   Changed description of movement to “tactical”. Blackhole sun’s accumulated damage will not be reset anymore by Genji’s cocoon. Fixed that Black Hole would sometimes apply damage twice. Black hole sun now shows the correct amount of max damage in the description. Reduced the growing delay on black hole sun from 0.3s to 0.1s.   Skree   Soul connectors now work with starstorm statue and mask of fear.   Swiggins   Added the stun duration in the description of anchor hook.   Ted McPain   Angel wing toilet paper description now states auto reload instead of the amount of bullets.   Vinnie & Spike   Spike dive now breaks stealth. Spike dive can be done while snared, Vinnie won’t move but will be able to deal spike dive damage.   Yuri   Carpet mines, Yuri will now throw all 3 mines at the same time, two in the front and one behind him (thanks Ten_Tacles for the idea!). Coins hit with Yuri’s laser will now always be pulled towards Yuri even if Yuri stops the laser.   Voltar got some big changes to improve his mechanics. Our intention was to fix a number of issues:  His burst damage with suicide drones which doesn't really fit his supportive role. To fix this we changed the suicide drones to fire one at a time, with a short cooldown. Drones shoot bullets that often don't hit and aren't very reliable. To fix this we have replaced the shot with a fast laser shot and increased the range and accuracy of drones. His low skill ceiling. Healbot and healing wave are too easy to use and his max potential is easily reached. To fix this we have made healing wave a single target Awesomenaut only heal, which can heal more individually and also deals damage to enemies, positioning is now more important. Since it has been changed so drastically we have renamed the skill to Techno Synaptic Wave. Healbot has reduced health and is easier to take down, and deals one pulse instead of multiple over time, again to improve positioning and timing. Overall both skills feel more active now and Voltar needs to move around more, to reach max potential. His dominance in group healing and weak single target healing. With all his healing abilities being able to heal in an area, made us balance him for good teamplay. This however harmed his ability to heal single targets and also work effectively in solo matches, where it is often hard to play the supportive role. As explained we have made healing wave a single target ability this removes the scaling in groups. To further increase his skill ceiling and to reduce his strength in groups, we have added a mechanic where his techno synaptic wave heals more the further he is away from his target. This should allow for more interesting positioning for Voltar and provide options for enemy teams to pick him out of a group. His Solar gain, which has always been almost double the amount of other nauts. We removed his Solar gain on wave and reduced the prices of all his items. By adding damage to his techno synaptic wave and increasing accuracy of the drones he has an easier time of last hitting enemies and gaining Solar.     Suicide drones now will be fired one per shot with a cooldown of 0.5s. Suicide drones now fire laserbeams instead of shots, their accuracy, range and attack speed have also been increased. Damage is reduced from 40 to 20 per shot but overall their DPS is a lot higher now. Drone amount is now visible in the skill dock. Suicide drones description in shop now states the summon cooldown and the shooting cooldown. Dark matter shots now only work on suiciding drones and blindtime is increased from 0.5s to 1s Fixed issue where Suicide drone summoning cooldown didn’t stop when max drone count was reached. Causing a new drone to pop up immediately after reducing the drone count. Weaponised hull damage increased from 30 to 50 per stage. Drone army price reduced from 200 to 180 solar . Dark matter shots price reduced from 140 to 125 solar. Weapon clip* on damage reduced from 20 to 10 per stage. Hyper drive price reduced from 210 to 170 solar per stage. Weaponized hull price reduced from 180 to 160 solar per stage. Warpgate overdrive price reduced from 200 to 180 solar per stage. Healbot will now only pulse once after deployment and after 1.7s. This pulse will heal for 450 health. * Healbot health is reduced from 600 to 300. Energy drink price reduced from 170 to 155 solar per stage. Overheal potion price reduced from 210 to 190 solar per stage. Overheal potion now increases the heal from 20 to 150. Turret add* on price reduced from 200 to 180 solar per stage. Turret add* on damage increased from 20 to 175 and the attackspeed is removed, since the healbot will only do one pulse at exit. Hydraulic sugar dispenser price reduced from 170 to 155 solar per stage. Hydraulic sugar dispenser knockback increased from 1 to 1.5. Cortex tank price reduced from 175 to 155 solar. Health pack surprise is replaced by Bombshell, Bombshell allows the healbot to drop a mine after time out. This mine deals 270 damage, lifetime of 8s and price is 145 solar, 2 stages. Healwave has been replaced bij Techno Synaptic Wave which is a fast healing shot, that increases in healing power the further it travels. this wave only heals friendly Awesomenauts. The wave also deals a flat amount of damage (40) to enemies and doesn’t provide extra solar on heals. Techno Synaptic Wave does reduce Voltar speed, but he is able to shoot the wave from the front as well as the back of his head, allowing easier healing while running away. Happy thoughts now increase max healing on range by 17 per stage for 135 per stage. Psychokinetic repulsion now increases attackspeed of techno synaptic wave, 10% per stage for 130 solar per stage. Psychothrust now increases range by a percentage, 20% per stage and also increases the max healing by 20% per stage for 120 solar per stage. Dreams of greed is replaced by Chilli flavoured eye drops. This upgrade increases the next healing wave after not using it for 3s in effectiveness. It multiplies the heal by 4, the damage by 2 and the heal over time (if you bought Euphoric thoughts) by 2, for 140 solar. Twisted nightmares now increases the damage by a flat amount of 20 per stage and a price of 150 solar. Euphoric thoughts now adds a heal over time, 105 healing over 10s per stage for 125 solar per stage. Solar krab burgers on Voltar have been replaced by Piggy bank.   Formatting credit: /u/Kalazor"

Droid waves will now always spawn at the same moment for both teams.   FINALLY! I've been waiting this to be fixed forever. This fix is good for everyone. Nothing was more annoying than an enemy wave being stilted and you not being able to farm properly off it using pierce attacks, or your wave being stilted and being less effective at supporting a push."

Awesomenauts,39blyk,beardedlinuxgeek,7,Wed Jun 10 21:42:04 2015 UTC,Wow. Looks like the Genji bug has indeed been fixed. When I tried to recreate it I either jumped normally or I was too early and failed to jump at all (which is fine since I was then on the ground and able to jump again immediately). Much better than the hovering a few centimeters off the ground for no reason at all. Also all my jumps in actual games have been succesful which is really nice. I even went 7-0 and got an Awesome! Thanks Ronimo!
Awesomenauts,39blyk,Kalazor,3,Wed Jun 10 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"NEW: Borderless window full-screen option   Finally!  Edit: Not on linux :/   -Dark matter flashbang has been replaced with Bovinian postcard which reduces the cooldown of dynamite throw with every hit of your blaster by 0.1s (2 stages for 140 Solar per stage).   I just did the math. With max attack speed and landing every shot, this potentially reduces the cooldown from 6s to 4.3s. I'm glad they go rid of blind, but I question how useful this will be.  I'm glad they reduced Ayla's lifesteal. They've also really nerfed Nibbs. I main her, but she did need a nerf. I think with Eye of Coba now being cheaper and firebreath damage being move expensive, we're going to see a lot more burst and melee Nibbs. Teleport in to do orb damage and then go after them with claws. You're going to do more damage and it'll be cheaper. Fire breath was always a risky move anyways. It's easy to get away from and live, and you're basically a sitting duck while using it."
Awesomenauts,39blyk,beardedlinuxgeek,3,Wed Jun 10 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"I'm getting that cooldown will be reduced to a minimum of 3.4s with both stages. 4.3s is if you have 1 stage and max cheetah bullets. I used excel to get those numbers, but I'll show here that they're correct with a couple equations.  For 1 stage (0.1s cooldown reduction per attack)  (Attack speed*Cheetah bullets bonus) / 60 = Attacks per second (166.7*1.4) / 60 = 3.88aps 3.88aps * 4.3s = 17 attacks = 1.7 cooldown reduction 1.7s + 4.3s = 6s (base dynamite cooldown)   For 2 stages  3.88aps * 3.4s = 13 attacks = 2.6s cooldown reduction 3.4s + 2.6s = 6s.   3.4s cooldown on dynamite sounds worth it to me, assuming it's feasible to hit all your bullets."

Guess not, seemed to be working normally when I tried to reproduce.   3) Couldn't see it in the patch notes: Creeps will no longer pick up nectar, although they will benefit from it if they're near it when a friendly naut collects it."
Awesomenauts,39blyk,Takley,2,Thu Jun 11 11:08:10 2015 UTC,noticed something odd with nibbs. when building blue and orange berries. animal necklace and special off skrogchu occasionally the orb will not work for two seconds after the cool down has ended. i get that this might be intentional but its really annoying to go into flame breath expecting to be able to teleport only to discover you can't after its already to late. if this is intentional please make it actually show up rather than just letting us find out orb doesn't work when we need it.

Also he should have a way to heal himself, the idea behind heal bot is basically the only good thing about him right now. My fix would be that destroying the heal bot makes it not give the heal."
Awesomenauts,39c4cp,pmj714,-2,Wed Jun 10 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"that already is implemented. you jsut can't destroy it before it is done charging.  voltar shouldn't be able to heal himself. the only way to beat a voltar comp is to kill voltar repeatedly and keep them from pushing. with selfheal that isn't possible.  him not being able to heal droids also is something i don't see as bad. chainpushing is what makes voltar so unbearable. if a voltar gets to your turrets that turret is basically not defendable unless all three from the non-voltar team are defending and have nauts that can deal with voltar.  basically voltar just got buffs for everything except burstdamage, but the other buffs make up for it. i don#t see how playing him, playing with him or playing against him is any more engaging than it was in 2.9, which was the supposed goal of 2.10."

We all fall back for moment, get 450 health, then move back into the fight with a huge advantage. Smart teams will see us retreating to the healbot and just run away unless they still have a huge advantage.

Awesomenauts,39c4cp,Kalazor,4,Wed Jun 10 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Simplest fix would be to increase the duration. But mines are kind of useless when you can only place them every 15 seconds or so. Yuri's mine do more damage than that and can be placeable in only a few seconds, and even then there are many ways to mitigate them. Right now, it's pretty much only good for droid clearing.  Maybe if the mine came out with the healbot, and not on the healbot's explosion, then it could deter dash attacks."

The multiply actually applies to the euphoric thoughts, and lets you give your teammates a massive [no pun intended] 420 regen over the span of 10 seconds.  I think, unless its unintentional and it'll get patched out, this is a hugely beneficial asset for Voltar allowing his teammates to play a little more aggressive or solo without losing the benefit of his extra sustain. It might just be undernoticed right now because of some other newfound strengths of his in this latest patch. I have to admit though, it's not a worthwhile upgrade without the chili eyedrops."

Awesomenauts,39ey3r,zeg685,0,Thu Jun 11 15:50:04 2015 UTC,Should I report it to mods?
Awesomenauts,39egcx,Mmmm_fstop,3,Thu Jun 11 04:45:50 2015 UTC,"Somebody mentioned this during the beta because they thought the same thing. It seems like too much of a counter to be able to target invisible nauts, so I doubt it's intentional, but I haven't seen an official response."
Awesomenauts,39egcx,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:11:23 2015 UTC,I think they always have (Not sure though so don't hold me to it)
Awesomenauts,39egcx,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:26:13 2015 UTC,"they didn't, i played a shit load of voltar bitd"
Awesomenauts,39fuhe,FlawlessHappiness,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:06:52 2015 UTC,I take the downvote as 'it is a meme'.  Sorry about that.

Awesomenauts,39bzgy,Unstriped,8,Wed Jun 10 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"I have some experience from the beta. As far as quick tips go, build your drones out first, use a DPS build, and walk up to enemies to finish them off with DPS.   Get damage and range on your AA. Always prioritize dealing damage over healing with AA unless you can save someone's life, or heal a target that is tanking a turret (giving everything behind them more time to attack the turret).  Use your healbot for healing, and try to deploy it outside of fights. Offensive usage is very difficult, try that out later when you're feeling confident. Don't forget to use healbot on pushes since it heals your droids."
Awesomenauts,39ctqp,thatonedudeinafield,4,Wed Jun 10 22:16:09 2015 UTC,I can confirm that this upgrade does not work as of right now.
Awesomenauts,39ctqp,TooHighTooFly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:54:10 2015 UTC,"2.10 seems to have a lot of bugs in it, so I wouldn't be shocked. Report this on the forums so we can get it fixed (unless it's just your allies breaking the stealth by attacking, of course)"
Awesomenauts,39ddib,natethegreat438,2,Thu Jun 11 00:32:07 2015 UTC,Hmm well I think I speak for some of the community at least where all  'nauts appear balanced except Ayla because it is still a character that needs minor tweaks like the damage scale of her Rage. I am annoyed that it does require minimal skill to play (From what I have seen).
Awesomenauts,39ddib,Slevens_,3,Thu Jun 11 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"Rage Ayla isn't easy, it requires a decent bit of skill to play rage well."
Awesomenauts,39ddib,KEEVAN1234,-2,Thu Jun 11 00:59:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I know I have played it a little but when the player has even just sub-par skill at her (Not hard xD) he burst is just stupid and when I see these players they are not fazed by any damage and just chase you down even if it kills them..
Awesomenauts,39ddib,Slevens_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:08:27 2015 UTC,"chainwack ayla is too easy to win with. especially with point-blank 900dmg evil eye following AA  I also think Skree's auto-attack has been OP since his release. gets you no matter what, no effort needed, extends and connects to nearby targets, free damage, no AA in this game has as much range. to make it worse, he can follow you nonstop without (I think) any movement speed penalty. Add to this the slow upgrade and you're typically fcked unless jumpad nearby"
Awesomenauts,39ddib,Zackcid,4,Thu Jun 11 07:17:42 2015 UTC,"He does lose movement speed while sitting. He does have one of the lowest damaging AAs, but can still be annoying at times."
Awesomenauts,39ddib,klawsin,3,Thu Jun 11 07:59:04 2015 UTC,"Ted has better AA range at base than Skree and then he can upgrade the range more. On top of that, his base AA damage is more than double Skree's, which makes up for it not locking onto targets. The range can seem greater on Skree's AA due to latency and the fact that once there's a lock-on, it doesn't matter how far the target moves away, the lightning will still hit."
Awesomenauts,39ddib,Handsomeglasses,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:21:17 2015 UTC,"the fact that once there's a lock-on, it doesn't matter how far the target moves away, the lightning will still hit.   this is what bothers me mostly. no escape, guaranteed death. those many scenes flashing before my eyes of all the times I'm running for my life while skree's casually just following by, slowing me down, and then ending my life. fml man"
Awesomenauts,39ddib,Zackcid,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:36:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, though you might not want to say stuff like this here O.o"
