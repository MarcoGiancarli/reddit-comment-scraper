beatles,3dyr8q,2Gex,7,Mon Jul 20 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"Well on the Anthology documentary, John says something along the lines of, ""They want songs? We'll give them the rejects,"" which is what the songs Only A Northern Song, Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, and It's All Too Much are. They're the reject songs from around the time. YellowSubmarine of course had to be there, and then All You Need Is Love was a big part of the movie, so they included that. The rest are the George Martin compositions, which are new. Because only two songs are old, I consider it a studio album, but I totally see what you mean."
beatles,3dyr8q,Jsaylol,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always say there are 11 regular studio albums (even if Let It Be is both posthumous and partly rooftop). Yellow Submarine is more of a genuine soundtrack album than Hard and Help!, because it's half score as well as the two ""oldies"" and four newish tracks.  But it's basically an ""album"", isn't it, an LP released under the band name and taking its place in the canon. I think we can all agree that MMT is even less of an album; that's a compilation, with every track recorded with discrete intentions (single, B-side, EP soundtrack, etc)."
beatles,3dyr8q,heynicepenis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"MMT not an album?  Nonsense!  It has some very iconic Beatles songs (I Am The Walrus, for crying out loud!) that aren't available on any of the other regular studio albums nor Past Masters.  It's also the most coherently themed Beatles album (if ""tripping balls"" counts as a coherent theme).  The way I see it, Yellow Submarine was a regular studio album because it included original pieces that weren't on previous albums nor singles.  Serious pieces, not ""Christmas time is here again"".  Past Masters usurped Yellow Submarine as a regular studio album, relegating it to relic of history (unless you're a George Martin fan...)"
beatles,3dyr8q,JBaloney,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you define an album. Saying that MMT isn't a true album isn't a slight on the songs themselves, which I'd agree are overall very strong. They simply weren't recorded at the same time and released together as a unit the way a ""true"" album is. The songs on MMT were recorded over the span of a year (a relatively long time considering only six years separated Please Please Me and Abbey Road). The same is even more true for Past Masters, which contains all the non-album singles they released throughout their entire career as Beatles."

beatles,3dyrbq,onetwothreefawn,2,Mon Jul 20 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite ""early"" Beatles songs. It's so raucous.  The opening movie scene is iconic and I love how John and Paul do their parts very well.   My favorite version though is from Anthology especially around 1:53 when Paul forgets the words, but finds them and John just gives a laugh. Good song :) ""One of Ringo's malapropisms.""  http://youtu.be/x6TrV5L7Nz4"
beatles,3dyrbq,DamnHellAssKings,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"It's a crucial ""Lennon AND McCartney"" song (songwriting-wise, and singing-wise of course), you can tell where is a contribution from each one of them while it makes up an incredible unity. Listen to various takes (on youtube), it's beautiful to see how it developed. Take 7 is almost grungy."
beatles,3dyrbq,onetwothreefawn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:30 2015 UTC,I totally agree that it's a crucial song for Lennon/McCartney. I think it is very close to the writing of A Day In The Life whereas John had the song and he probably asked Paul to throw a small piece together for the Middle 8.   Great contributions from both on an iconic sing.
beatles,3dyrbq,DamnHellAssKings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty much just a John Lennon composition. Ringo came up with the phrase ""a hard day's night"" and after they decided to use it as the film's title, John wrote the song in one night.  From the 1980 Playboy Interview - ""...the next morning I brought in the song... 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side — who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine... in the early period I'm dominating the group.... The reason Paul sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes.""  However, I'd agree it does seem like a perfect example of the John negative/Paul positive interplay much like We Can Work It Out or Getting Better. John's complaining about his hard day and Paul is singing about how everything seems to be right, their typical roles as songwriters, but in this case John apparently basically wrote the whole thing.  Personally, I've always felt this song isn't as interesting as most of their other stuff from this period. Fairly basic chord changes and the lyrics aren't great even for early Beatle standards (""working like a dog/sleeping like a log"" is a really weak opening couplet imo). But I do feel they make up for all that with the energy and enthusiasm they put into the recording and some of the cool touches like the opening chord and the doubling of George's guitar solo on the piano."

His post-accident/Basement Tapes period is mature, deep, but it's more of the same (which does not mean it's not great, of course.)"
beatles,3dwls9,celebratedmrk,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of misspoke on that. I absolutely love Blood on the Tracks and New Morning, and Nashville Skyline is the only other Dylan album I enjoy wholly front to back. He definitely had some of his best songs in the mid-60's, but there's still a lot on those albums that I don't really like. Like someone else pointed out, I overlooked the albums that came in between those ones, so I wouldn't put that period up against The Beatles.

I didn’t know what to do, nobody had photographed a group before so I just got them outside with their guitars, and Ringo with a cymbal. It was the only thing I could think of.   The pictures are so naive. They didn’t know what to do either, but it was the beginning of everything. They were recording Please Please Me, and people didn’t know they’d be big. But they were four great personalities, it shone out of them.   John was in charge, you can see that he’s the leader from the picture, he was definitely the stronger force. He wanted to be at the front. John and Paul were a great double act, not just on stage. Off stage they were clever young hustlers.   John had the irony, Paul the charm. They were nobody’s fools. George was a brilliant musician, but shy and serious. Ringo was new to the band and was a very funny guy.   An editor had asked me to photograph the emerging youth culture. They just seemed to sum up the changing mood of the times. They had hair that was long for the day, and their clothes were smart, but relaxed, almost casual. I took the pictures back to the paper.   They sat in the editor’s in-tray but one day there were no train crashes or wars or sensational trials to put on the front page, so he put The Beatles on it – and there was this amazing response. The newspaper sold out. It was a revelation – young people bought the paper because a young unknown band was on the front page.   A few weeks later the record was released and it went straight to No 1. In weeks, they were the biggest news in Britain; in months the biggest news in the world – and the Sixties took off.

beatles,3dvfsc,sir_wooly_merkins,2,Mon Jul 20 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"I like your list - BUT (!!!)...  ""Ask Me Why"" is phenomenal. It not only has the best harmonies since ""This Boy"", but improves on that song by adding a (quasi) second chorus, equally as well-crafted as the first. It also is one of the finest early examples of the ascending-to-minor/7th progression model that would characterize so many of their classics to come. An under-appreciated triumph, imo.  ""Love You To"" is equally a keeper for me. It is the first full-length ""sitar"" song on a Beatles record, and is credited as displaying some of the best playing of the instrument by a Western musician to that time. Add to that the fantastic crunching guitar chord under the chorus and the rollicking tempo - gold. There are 7 songs more expendable than this on Revolver, imo (not that any of them are actually... ""bad"")."

The Beatles brought back what the avant grade period had thrown away, such as 4 part harmony, modulation, etc.. things that could be found all over classical music and was once again being used in pop music. basically, The Beatles were using a lot of classical elements in modern pop for the first time.

Magical Mystery Tour Your Mother Should Know (not #5) I am the Walrus (not #6) The Fool on the Hill (not #2) Flying (not #3) Blue Jay Way (not #4)   For every other release, the UK version has always been considered the official version, but when they released the black box set in the 80s, they decided to go with the american version instead, so they wouldn't be wasting room on the CD by having a bunch of room left. This way they could make MMT the same length as the rest of them, and shorten the Past Masters collection a bit. For some reason that stuck ever since, and even today people listen to the american version, even though most music is digital anyways and there's absolutely no reason to."

beatles,3dqlwy,Shyrobot,39,Sat Jul 18 18:21:16 2015 UTC,I think they split at just the right time. The 70s was such a tacky era and their songs generally got worse from 1970 onwards. By splitting they did what few bands do. Stay perfect! And timeless!   Plus we never had to watch the Beatles try and keep up with a trend later in their career. (they were pioneers of 60's but they might've felt the need to be more punk or new wave in the 70s/80s cringe)
beatles,3dqlwy,GoodGrades,13,Sat Jul 18 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, their 1971 album with tracks from Imagine, Plastic Ono Band, Ram, and All Things Must Pass would have been amazing."

beatles,3dqlwy,dachjaw,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:20 2015 UTC,One of many attempts to predict what their next album would have been like. I would have bought it.
beatles,3dqlwy,fuzzzcanyon,9,Sat Jul 18 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I always thought that theory also applies to John. I know it was tragic etc, that goes without saying, but, I think if John were still around that he would be really, really cringeworthy. Like Paul said in an interview not long back, John became something in death that he could never be in life."
beatles,3dqlwy,mykeuk,39,Sat Jul 18 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"That Revolution #9 is really, really good. All good songs work against an emotion, being it love, sadness, happiness etc. Rev 9 works on fear. Seriously. Turn the lights off so it's really dark and listen to it with a pair of headphones. It'll freak you out!"
beatles,3dqlwy,bungle123,9,Sat Jul 18 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Revolution #9 is easily in my top 5 songs on The White Album, and is one of their most interesting songs, imo. I can see why so many people dislike it, though."

beatles,3dqlwy,Salute_The_Bud,4,Sat Jul 18 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"it's unpopular to the Beatles and Apple. when Neil was still CEO, he mentioned in an interview that they had considered releasing Let it Be again, however, when rewatching old footage (in movie and deleted scenes) too many old wounds were opened.  it'll probably happen when all key members involved with Apple and The Beatles are dead"
beatles,3dqlwy,RambunctiousHatboy,3,Sat Jul 18 19:50:58 2015 UTC,I know Paul doesn't want it released for that reason. It's a shame because it'd be a great insight into how the band was at the time and how they worked out songs.  Know where I can watch/read that interview?
beatles,3dqlwy,Salute_The_Bud,4,Sat Jul 18 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"quotes taken from Wikipedia,   ""In February 2007, Apple Corps' Neil Aspinall said, ""The film was so controversial when it first came out. When we got halfway through restoring it, we looked at the outtakes and realised: this stuff is still controversial. It raised a lot of old issues.""[42]""  "" The two were concerned about the effect on the band's ""global brand ... if the public sees the darker side of the story. Neither Paul nor Ringo would feel comfortable publicising a film showing the Beatles getting on each other's nerves ... There's all sorts of extra footage showing more squabbles but it's questionable if the film will ever see a reissue during Paul and Ringo's lifetime.""[43]""  all of this is funny of course, because if the stuff was controversial then why even release the film initially!"
beatles,3dqlwy,Brian_Braddock,78,Sat Jul 18 20:08:08 2015 UTC,Paul wrote better songs than John.
beatles,3dqlwy,Memerttyuui,42,Sat Jul 18 14:44:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. Paul had a better solo career too. Sorry not sorry.

beatles,3dqlwy,Memerttyuui,31,Sat Jul 18 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Straying into super unpopular territory... I'd say John lost a lot leaving the Beatles.
beatles,3dqlwy,TroyLucas,14,Sat Jul 18 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, though John's solo career is not without it's highlights.  Unfortunately, it seems every song Yoko touched makes me want to claw my eyes out and place them in a bucket of bleach."
beatles,3dqlwy,jimothee,11,Sat Jul 18 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and John's production quality was oddly...terrible. Paul's 'Ram' by far surpasses most of anything any of them did post Beatles, in my opinion. And I'd actually much rather listen to Linda sing than whatever the hell Yoko's doing."
beatles,3dqlwy,TroyLucas,5,Sat Jul 18 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"Paul's got some great albums.  Venus & Mars is definitely a favourite.  Though we'll never know what could have happened if John had made albums in the 80's, the 90's...  It really seems like he was coming back artistically before his assassination.  As far as production quality, he always preferred the raw organic sound of live playing.  Paul, on the other hand was willing to spend 3 days just getting some background synth part right (Maxwell's Silver hammer).  It's that combination of different attitudes to creativity which is why The Beatles have made some of the strongest music of the 20th century, and possibly ever."
beatles,3dqlwy,Memerttyuui,2,Sat Jul 18 18:31:33 2015 UTC,Paul was really prolific and toured throughout the 70's. John was quite the opposite.

But John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the best Beatles solo album, without a doubt. John bears his soul + stripped down White album musical style + Ringo on drums. No contest."
beatles,3dqlwy,uaretheeggman,2,Sun Jul 19 00:02:18 2015 UTC,I'd have to completely disagree. Paul's solo career was nothing compared to John's. John continued to create masterful works of art while Paul just made muzak without much substance.
beatles,3dqlwy,Goran1693,6,Sat Jul 18 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Without much substance?   ...  Live and Let Die?  Band On The Run?  Maybe I'm Amazed?  Jet?  Here Today?  Let Me Roll It?  In my opinion, Paul may not have been as lyrically inclined during his Wings days as he was during The Beatles, but he sure kicked it up a few notches with the instruments he used and the vast amount of new sounds he produced after The Beatles."
beatles,3dqlwy,uaretheeggman,5,Sat Jul 18 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yes many of the songs you named lack substance. Paul may have written a few good songs here and there, but most of what he put out was meaningless fluff. They were basically on the same level as many of today's pop songs.  New instruments does not equal better songs. And I would argue that he made barely any new sounds in his solo career, if any. On the other hand, John chose not to stick with boring pop songs and actually created new sounds, even though it alienated many of his old fans."
beatles,3dqlwy,Goran1693,3,Sat Jul 18 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"Hey hey I never said Johns stuff wasn't good. I'm equally a fan of both their solo careers. Compared to all the other genres of music that were popular in the 70s, Paul AND John went against the grain and did their own thing. It's just my opinion that Paul brought more to his songs during his solo career. Again, never said John brought nothing, if anything he brought out more during his solo stuff too."
beatles,3dqlwy,radiohead420,4,Sat Jul 18 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"If I say this, people assume Im saying John was shit. I think he's the second greatest song writer ever, Paul is just a bit better for me"
beatles,3dqlwy,xavyre,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"While I totally disagree, I though what you just stated is by far the popular opinion. It seems like everyone loves Paul's writing with just a minority liking John's stuff."

beatles,3dqlwy,newmyy,35,Sat Jul 18 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the reasons I love it. Sure the Beatles loved music and felt it deeply, but at their core they were a bunch of jokesters. Hell, George Harrison believed that the spirit of the Beatles carried on into Monty Python. I think it's brilliantly hilarious that they make you think their final album is going to end on a massive, beautiful crescendo, only to end on a half written song that ends on a note that doesn't even compete the phrase. I think it was one of the most perfect things about their career.   Respect that you disagree. Just my two cents."
beatles,3dqlwy,FloydPink24,7,Sat Jul 18 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. Adds a kind of humour and playfulness to the whole thing, reminding us what The Beatles have been all about."

The only artist who I think ranks up there in 'household-nameness' is Michael Jackson, and we all know how that turned out.  That kind of fame changes a person, and all the experiences they had over the 7 years they were together sure did too.  August 1962 is when Ringo officially joined The Beatles and made the lineup we know today, still playing in The Cavern.  August 1965, just three years later they're playing Shea Stadium, the first stadium concert ever!  There are very few people who can really say what that does to someone."

I'd throw Elvis in there, but he was only one person, not a group, so there wasn't a support structure there for him.    I'd possibly throw the Stones in there, just because they were achieving a certain level of fame just a little behind the Beatles, then kept going in the 70s.

I had the cash to see one of their concerts but my parents wouldn't let me go.  It was a heady time. They were talked about everywhere, mostly lame references to their hair or loud playing or how their music was corrupting the youth. When they started getting weird (Paperback Writer was their first song where I wondered what the heck they doing), it changed to how they were Communist or counterrevolutionists or promoting drugs. Fortunately my dad was very cool about it. I remember him pointing out features of their music: tight harmonies, unusual instruments, time signature changes, how the White Album contained so many different musical genres. He liked some songs and not others, but always had a reason, and taught me to think that way too."
beatles,3dqlwy,birds_of_berlin_ny,2,Sun Jul 19 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"Well said. Very few were 'there,' but I was almost ten when I first heard the name ""The Beatles."" After the Ed Sullivan shows, my father was inspired to bring home the IWTHYH/ISHST 45. We listened to it over and over. In late June, he bought us the ""Meet The Beatles"" LP. By that time, you would have been hard pressed to not hear about Beatles in nearly every conversation. The closest I've ever gotten to being 'there' was flying over England on my way to Germany. Still, exposure to The Beatles saturated life all through the 60's.Today, at 61y.o., I still feel a lot of what I felt then.   One of the things I love about r/beatles is reading comments from younger folks just discovering them. It goes a long way in showing how The Beatles remain relevant. The other thing I love about this sub is the overall civility. All 'opinions' are valid, in my opinion. In the end, ""the love you take, is equal to the love you make."""

As to repeating other's opinions - not as a rule. I was taught to think and rather enjoy the experience.   In aggregate and with hindsight, it's quite straightforward to arrive at an accurate perception of the Beatles. Extremely talented, extremely lucky. Perfected a commercial sound and then reinvented the rules. Survived a mediocre manager. Didn't survive their own egos.  Unpopular opinion:    John was not bright. He was clever and massively insecure. Paul has always been a phony kiss ass albeit gifted tunesmith.  George's introduction of world music and Eastern religion dwarfs anything the others did. Ringo's drumming exhibits the consistently best musicianship in the band."

And I wouldn't say any of your opinions are unpopular except maybe the third."
beatles,3dqlwy,mistral7,3,Sun Jul 19 00:34:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Mal or Neil were that close at different parts of the era. I don't think anyone is claiming to be a frog in their pocket. Ipso facto, everything is second hand information and I suspect even JPG&R actually remember very little clearly.  Studio engineering took place in Texas and Massachusetts from '65 - '74. Some well known artists. A few outstanding sessions. I seem to recall being bored a time or two but on balance the most fun you could have while blowing out your hearing."

There playing was tight, their singing was excellent, the songwriting was engaging and surprising, and there's just so much youthful energy which is what really takes them above and beyond."

I do love She's a Rainbow - definitely the most coherent song on there.  Out of interest what're your favourites from that album?

Sing This All Together (See What Happens) is one of them, and In Another Land and On With The Show are the other two. She's A Rainbow and Citadel are my two favorite songs on the album. I actually found out recently that John Lennon and Paul McCartney provide backing vocals and percussion on Sing This All Together, which is pretty cool."

They've probably done a bunch of other things with the Stone too.  A little disappointed with In Another Land. Could have been a solid song, but that weird effect they add to Bill Wyman's voice is really grating.  No matter though I got Sticky Fingers and recently bough Exile On Main Street, so they'll keep me content :)"

At least publicly, she's never said a bad word about anybody, aside from the occasional put-down of Paul but only ever in the context of defending her husband.  She's easily one of the most despised celebrity wives of the past 50 years, yet if you read her prose or even her Twitter account, she has made a point of trying to bring only positivity to peoples' lives.  I can't imagine doing that without becoming jaded by the vitriol aimed at her.  Anything weird/awful she did with the Beatles or John's music was at John's insistence, not hers, and was almost never meant to be viewed as pop music.  (Admittedly, her first two marriages were highly unsuccessful.)"

She's been pretty unsupportive of Julian through the years as well.  Yes, she's pretty positive to 'the world' but... I'd think more highly of her as a person if she'd been more supportive of Julian.  Whatever was going on, he was still just a kid (17?) when his dad was killed, and it would have been nice to see them get along on some level, vs the animosity for so many years."
beatles,3dqlwy,mayor_of_awesometown,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but that's a bit difficult. Many people have strained relationships with their stepchildren, and I can only imagine it being even more difficult since she barely knew him, she never lived with him, he lived on a different continent, and they'd both just experienced a murder of a close loved one. Even in ideal circumstances, that would be difficult.  As for Paul, all negative comments made about him have only ever been in response to questions posed to her by the media, and she's never put him down personally. She's just stated that she thinks John was a better songwriter -- not surprising, considering John was her husband and is not around to defend himself anymore."

beatles,3dqlwy,beatlesbible,3,Sat Jul 18 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Phil Spector gets unfairly lambasted for his work on Let It Be.  He only worked on the album for a total of seven recording/mixing/editing sessions, after The Beatles had split up. He didn't have time to sift through the many hours of music and dialogue recorded more than a year previously, so relied on the selections already made by Glyn Johns.  He mainly made his mark on three songs - The Long And Winding Road, I Me Mine and Across The Universe. The latter was recorded in 1968 before the back-to-basics LIB concept, and had plenty of overdubs before Spector got anywhere near it.  I really don't see how Spector ruined songs like Two Of Us, One After 909, Dig A Pony or Get Back. Apart from the three songs he added overdubs to, it's probably only the added echo on Let It Be that sounds particularly Spector-like. The rest of his involvement was fairly straightforward mixes and edits. It was actually quite restrained in comparison with some of the music he was famed for.  Lennon, 1970:   he was given the shittiest load of badly recorded shit - and with a lousy feeling to it - ever. And he made something out of it. It wasn't fantastic, but I heard it, I didn't puke. I was so relieved after six months of this black cloud hanging over.   Starr, Anthology:   I like what Phil did, actually. He put the music somewhere else and he was king of the 'wall of sound'. There's no point bringing him in if you're not going to like the way he does it - because that's what he does. His credentials are solid."
