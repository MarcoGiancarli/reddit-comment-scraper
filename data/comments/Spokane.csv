Spokane,3e5aun,CancerAndCookies,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:44:09 2015 UTC,When I was in high school (graduated in '95) there was a place open until midnight called Java Jitters. Used to be a great place to get a 23 shot espresso. Lol. Sadly when you have something eclectic open that late you mostly end up with the homeless street kids and drama ensues.

All we ask is that you buy a drink or two and / or something to eat!   We've got 8 rounds of 8 questions each. Most rounds are themed in some way, wether a bad pun, or a ""Current Events"" type situation. We also offer an audio round where we play clips of music and have you identify the artist & title; a video round where we show you cips of movies & ask for the title; and finally, a visual round where we show you pictures and ask you to answer questions about them. It's a good time, IMHO, but I may be biased, as the host! :p"

Spokane,3dyax1,BroYourOwnWay,9,Mon Jul 20 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"Because the other times are reserved for private rental times, swim lessons, lifeguard certification and training, etc."

Spokane,3dyax1,SamsBackpack,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"Because Spokane has shit for their parks budget. They used to be open every day of the week for much longer than 4 hours. I remember the year they weren't open at all, or even filled with water for that matter."
Spokane,3dyax1,No_U_Crazy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.  My kids nap just after lunch.  So, basically, they don't go to the pool, ever."
Spokane,3dyax1,No_U_Crazy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:48 2015 UTC,Mine to. We got to go for 1 hour yesterday before they made us leave. At the absolute height of the afternoon.
Spokane,3dyax1,normsy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly, they probably use ""low attendance"" as a reason for keeping their hours so short.  I was a lifeguard for a county pool system back in NY.  Those pools and beaches were open from 7 am to 8 pm all summer long, Memorial Day to Labor Day. I've never seen a pool system with such short hours and I have trouble understanding why.  Lifeguards were already trained before they started work, and then continued their training while the pool was open.  Private rentals basically never happened during normal hours."

That is pretty lame time framing though. I wonder if it has to do with crime around the pool areas or anything?

But a lot of people don't know that there's a wheel you can spin at the Satellite, too.  Then go to O'Doherty's when you're good and buzzed, pay a dollar to sing a song while standing on the bar - then sign it and you get to staple it to the wall somewhere.

Have written reviews for a few sites. Attended IPCPR last year. Not this year, not enough money, hopefully next year again.  Anyways. The state line lounge is at least free to bring your own smokes and you are not over charged for drinks/sticks. Much more casual than the Legends of Fire."

Spokane,3dv77k,David_ESM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"I won't be. Two other trips and buying a new home have taken away from the cigar fund for the immediate future.  Grabbed a box of the Tatuaje M80s before they sold out in 24 hours at the beginning of the month. Also snagged a box of the 2015 Las Calaveras. Will probably pick up or split a box of Crowned Heads La Imperiosas when they come out. And then after that probably won't drop much on cigars until winter/next year. Then I need to update my CC stash.  Edit: And not to insult the guys who show up to Little Smoke, I have met and spoken with most of them and they are good people, but I don't really smoke any of their stuff anymore with the exception of some of Boofy's stuff. I would just end up donating the cigars I get to the troops."

Spokane,3dv10a,colbinator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid I ran that carrousel during the summer. Letting someone get away with that ring is highly frowned upon by management. The rider is supposed to turn it in for a free ride ticket. Many people tried to escape with it during my tenure but at that time the garbage goat was a real goat and he was trained to ram ring stealers into the path of the tour train.   You'd think all the rings were made of solid gold the way management spoke about them. Letting children take the plastic rings was just as bad in their eyes. The children weren't the problem though, asking nicely goes a long way with kids. Parents on the other hand are terrible people and would argue to their last breath that it's only a few rings. A few rounds later and there's no rings to put out. I don't know why management didn't just keep a larger supply of the damn things. Oh and the worst part was getting under the carrousel to collect rings and garbage. It's dark, dusty, cramped, and sorta scary under there."

They had a lot of available units a month ago so I only pay $634 plus $40 for utilities (excluding electric)... Very reasonable for a practically new apartment.

The best place I rented in the valley (this was 5-6 years ago) was further south on 29th between Pines and the highway there.  There's a fairly quiet neighborhood down there with some smaller apartment complexes. I also know quite a few people who live in the Homestead apartments on 4th and Sullivan, they are a bit pricey but they're very nice inside and well-kept.

They claimed they were delivering their seafood and steaks ""to a neighbor"" and they had leftovers that they were selling for ""practically nothing."" It was two guys, both early twenties, one white and one black.  I politely declined but watched them visit every house on the street.  Not a major creeper/child luring feeling, but definitely a scammer type thing.

Once people know it's reliable they'll use it more and that's were the cost benefits come in. Plus transit tends to do great things for property value especially when it's more permanent fixtures. Increased property values means more revenue for the city! Just remember that when we pay taxes sometimes we will pay for things we don't use.   Also we should take on projects that will fulfill our goals as a city. Ask yourself what you want Spokane to be like and then vote that way.

Spokane,3dj1vt,littlebigfoxx,4,Fri Jul 17 00:40:32 2015 UTC,Since it's been six hours and nobody has had anything to say I'll fire away with my jest:  It looked pretty great from a distance.
Spokane,3dj1vt,streetchicken,2,Fri Jul 17 00:18:18 2015 UTC,Haha my thoughts exactly. I had a feeling that a group of strangers willing to meet up in a sports bar wearing cat shirts might be a bit...interesting.

Spokane,3dbivd,peanutbuttar,12,Wed Jul 15 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"You are not the only one with a negative experience. When they did their shoot in front of the Madison (by the Fox Theatre) they effectively wrecked most of the business that the Luxe received during the day, except for the lackies running to get the people on set/ production their coffees. Apparently for an order of twenty mochas, macchiatos and all of the varieties thereof, earned the barista a 0% tip. I think that's a pretty dick move, but, whatever. Maybe tipping isn't their thing, even at the expense of ruining the bulk of a local's business day...  ... What I can't wrap my mind around is why they didn't clean up the splashes of faux blood on the sidewalk, the broken bits of particle wood scattered here and there, as well as random bits of automobile parts (hubcaps, etc), which, in the end, were pushed into the gutter for our city to clean up.  I've heard Z Nation was a garbage television show but after that experience, I don't feel compelled in the slightest to give the show a chance."
Spokane,3dbivd,Blood_farts,6,Wed Jul 15 00:34:01 2015 UTC,What. The. Fuck.  Why are we allowing this?
Spokane,3dbivd,IDefDontLikeU,6,Wed Jul 15 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping they paid the city extra for cost of clean up. The faux blood washed away after a week or two, and most of the debris by the next trash day, but still... I thought it was kind of a slap in the face the people who lived in the neighborhood and the local businesses."

Spokane,3dbivd,Voodoobones,6,Wed Jul 15 03:45:12 2015 UTC,"That's pretty shitty to cause a mess and not clean it up. But wait, there's more.  They're making money off of the mess they made and they are not cleaning it up.  That pisses me off in principle. In reality, I don't think those wood chips will have an effect on anything, so I don't care... but they have staff and willingly chose not to clean it up. That pisses me off.  I'm conflicted. Just because you can't see harm in something doesn't mean you should make it someone else's problem. If you disagree, give me your address. I'm tired of picking up my dogs' shit. It won't harm you if I let him shit in your yard or sidewalk, right?"
Spokane,3dbivd,mwproductions,5,Wed Jul 15 00:34:43 2015 UTC,You should sent a tweet to @SpokaneCity asking if ZNation is going to continue making messes where ever they go and not cleaning up.

Spokane,3dbivd,streetchicken,3,Wed Jul 15 03:32:41 2015 UTC,As the production had many different moves and sets today the crew that picks up and cleans up are catching up and cleaning up as we go along. Don't fret. It should be cleaned up by now or will soon.
Spokane,3dbivd,Cameldickkkk,3,Wed Jul 15 03:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yup they came by just about 20 minutes or so ago and cleaned it up. I actually thought it was a few of my neighbors who were going to meet up at dusk to sweep it up starting without me! But I'm thankful they were able to come out.  I don't really want to push this any more towards an argument than I already did by posting it in the first place, but I did think it was really weird how when I thanked them they abruptly were like ""yeah it was [one of the sweepers] idea"". I still have the feeling that if I hadn't posted, they wouldn't have revisited. Especially after hearing about what happened at the Madison.  But hey, it got taken care of, and as long as the ship sails smoothly for future shoots, it doesn't really matter to me whether this post had any effect or whether they were already coming out on their own initiative, all I really care about is that we know cleanups will be thorough in the future. So I'm satisfied."
Spokane,3dbivd,AGlassOfMilk,3,Wed Jul 15 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"Perhaps what's needed is more clear communication with the people who live and work in the area around sets.  We expect that when the crew leaves, they'll take their mess with them. In actuality, there's a team who comes later to clean up, so people should be aware that there will be a mess that appears to be left behind forever, when in actuality that mess is just waiting for a different crew to come handle it.  So that knowledge, combined with when the mess is expected to be cleaned up, would go a long way toward helping people feel better about having been inconvenienced."
Spokane,3dbivd,AGlassOfMilk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:57 2015 UTC,Or we all could just relax a little before bitching about things like this. We have become such an instant gratification culture. Let's give people a chance to do their jobs before complaining.   I once was told the reason you will see more negative reviews than positive review is because people will take action when they are unhappy but are less likely to take action when they are happy.
Spokane,3dbivd,AGlassOfMilk,3,Wed Jul 15 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"Let's give people a chance to do their jobs before complaining.   My point is that, without the aforementioned communication, how are people supposed to know that crew A is leaving a mess that crew B will come clean up? I think it's fair for most people assume that crew A is the only crew, and when they pack up and leave, no one is coming back."
Spokane,3dbivd,AGlassOfMilk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"They probably have use special use permit from the city. I'd complain to the planning department about this issue and the other one that is the top comment, because they are probably not fulfilling the conditions of their permit. Also, that permit probably does include cost reimbursement, as someone else was complaining about their tax money paying for the cleanup"

For the bar thing, it really depends on the environment you want. On a weekday the bars near fast eddies will be moderately busy, and at barrachos they have taco Tuesday. My favorite bars are the riff and Monterey, nice chill environment, both have patios, play good music, but on weekdays they can be lame. Jack and dans will be dead since its a gonzaga bar and they're out for summer. And gu is within long walking distance to downtown so you can easily see the macarthy center and campus."

Red Lion River Inn, Red Lion at the Park, Oxford Suites, and Holiday Inn Express.  All of these are a mile or less from the McCarthey Athletic Center (where the Zags play) and less than a mile from dead center downtown.  They are also all on a path, The Centennial Trail, that will get you the McCarthey Athletic Center without having to walk on the streets.    These hotels would also be just above the falls, and you'd basically be in Riverfront Park, a relatively large park downtown that includes the falls.  Several walking bridges that have great views of the falls.  To get a view from below the falls I would suggest walking down to Huntington Park."

Spy was decent, I've heard good things about Inside Out.  Those are all playing at the AMC downtown.

Spokane,3d82so,kabbra,4,Tue Jul 14 06:18:53 2015 UTC,"There are tons of trails on the Northside, starting first and foremost with Riverside State Park. There are endless miles of trails, and numerous entry points. I've been running there for years and there are areas I've never been yet. My personal fave is the run from 7 mile all the way to the TJ Meenach Bridge on trail 25.  Also, check out the Holmberg Conservation Area up by Whitworth. Some tough climbing in there! There's also a sweet backdoor Bloomsday trail that follow the river and Palisades Park.   The corridor trail is paved and pretty lame, if you ask me. It's a nice smooth trail like the Centennial Trail, but instead of river views, you have highways! Still, a good thoroughfare!"
Spokane,3d82so,Spokanistan509,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:27 2015 UTC,This is a good answer. Soooo many miles of trails at Riverside. If you park at 7 mile you don't need the discovery pass.

I live up on the north side as well, so I like to go to Holmberg park and also to the trailheads by St. George's private school, although you will need a discovery pass. Both areas have quite a climb at the start."
Spokane,3d82so,purplehoney,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"The terrain isn't exactly forgiving and you'll likely encounter mountain bikers on the ""easy"" paths but I don't think anything on the north side, possibly in town, tops beacon hill for both accessibility and viability.  You can hit the west side of it from Esmerelda or Minehaha and you can tackle the south side from Shields Park and the east side from Sekani.  Anywhere centennial links up might also work.  If you're west of the shadle area you might have better luck with the area behind SFCC. If nothing else the terrain there is less intensive than beacon hill and most of it (if not all of it) is paved.  I have seen people doing various activities in the empty area between Nevada and Crestline just north of Lincoln but I don't think you're technically supposed to be on that land.  I've heard the Corridor has a bike path, but I've never explored it so I have no idea how viable it might be for running."

You mention what people are buying Honda's and Subaru's; that is because both are known to be reliable cars, in addition Subaru's all have desirable AWD. You on the other hand are selling a V6, meaning not the desirable V8, which makes a 'muscle car'. Compound that with 123K (nobody believes your non aggressive driving) on a Ford. The majority of people don't want a domestic brand car (trucks, totally different)  with over 100K, and that is my non expert opinion."
Spokane,3d7t0c,hickory29,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:30 2015 UTC,Upside to the v6 is much lower insurance and way better MPG. At least it's not a GM product...

Spokane,3d1z8p,streetchicken,10,Sun Jul 12 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"In like '96 my grandpa was telling be about an almost identical freeway that he tried to push through city council, along with Appleway and incorporating the valley. This was in the 50's or 60's and they told him it was all a stupid waste of time.  Now they're doing all of the same shit but it's way too late because we urban sprawled all over the planet and it's ruining everything."
Spokane,3d1z8p,Ohzza,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:17 2015 UTC,I kinda imagine the freeway making sprawl worse. If the exburbs are more accessible then there'll be more demand and then there'll be more houses and people up there.
Spokane,3d1z8p,No_U_Crazy,3,Mon Jul 13 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"Well that's suburban sprawl, if you have better traffic infrastructure you can have a higher density of businesses in one set location without those commerce centers getting lousy with gridlock. It also makes the sprawl less horrible.  Like imagine removing nearly all of the people commuting from Division from Garland to Francis, and the whole Nevada/Market. It would make it way easier to sustain more businesses in those areas."
Spokane,3d1z8p,Ohzza,2,Mon Jul 13 04:05:01 2015 UTC,It's sad to me seeing it already pushing up north.  They just clear cut the land right behind my apartment (ridge at midway) to make room for more houses.  They're also tearing up a big plot between wandermere and 395.  In 20 years spokane will just blend into everything to the north :(

Spokane,3d1z8p,BroYourOwnWay,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"This freeway as pointed out has been talked about and hashed to death for some 50 years plus. When it was first proposed it immediately drew negative reactions and was fought. I would tend to agree with you re: forward thinking. My first hope has been for Spokane to get light rail, but we know where that goes time and time again. From what I hear STA has not given up on the trolley line, and that pleases me because I think it would enhance economic development for Spokane. The trolley passed in the city of Spokane, Airway Heights, and Cheney, but it lost in the eastern suburbs of Spokane, almost all of them. Maybe eventually the people of the area will understand that light rail is good and needed, and it will enahance and attract economic development. I wish the freeway ( north/south) would have been done 40 years ago. No such luck. So at this point we will have to take what/when we can get get, but we can do better."
Spokane,3d1z8p,BroYourOwnWay,2,Mon Jul 13 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that we couldn't get a light rail proposal on the ballot without the Valley. If they don't want it, fine. It should serve a more urban purpose anyways."

K-Mart is now a Lowe's, the old Lowe's/Eagle's is now nothing.  Franklin Park mall has changed significantly, stores are no longer connected indoors, and a new building has appeared, soon to be a Rite-Aid, a Trader Joe's is going in, presumably at the old Rite-Aid location.  The Wendle across from Northtown was torn down, and is now a strip mall.  Wendel is now located at the Y, and pretty large. Wandermere is very different, way less trees, way more businesses."

They've been unsure for years whether there will be funding for the rest, last year a lot of legislators even said it probably wouldn't happen.  But the state budget that just came out last week funded it to completion.  Now they need to start clearing property out and building it.  Not supposed to be done until 2029.

While he doesn't know a lot of what has been going on I think he's been picking up on some of the negative energy and me trying to hold it in around him.  I think his whole ""no I don't want to do anything special"" is because he doesn't want to be a bother or feels bad.  I remember when I was his age that was the first time I didn't want to do a party either.  I just wanted me parents to take me and a couple of friends to a movie.

Spokane,3d2276,archer1212,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"I think his whole ""no I don't want to do anything special"" is because he doesn't want to be a bother or feels bad.   That's rough. I can definitely understand why you'd want to make it special. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know."

Just really wanted a few friends over and have us hang out with some food and games. Maybe rent a movie or go to the theater.

Spokane,3d2276,crosscountryloves,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'm renting an inflatable waterslide for my wedding and it's  $333 delivered for a huge monstrosity. So sumo wrestling or one of the other activities would be similar or less I'd imagine? Plus, all the places I had looked to rent inflatables from also had specials for combining a snocone machine or other concession for $50.   But honestly, if there wont be too many friends then I'd highly recommend just going to silver mountain for the night. $400 will get you a 2 bedroom suite and 2 days at the waterpark for 6 or 8 people  (i forgot how many wristbands it included, but extra ones are cheap). We're obsesser with going to Silver for a little getaway with the kids. Around that time of year the mountain biking might ve fun for 12 yr olds too!"

After the $29($32 after taxes) promotion, talked them easily into $37 (after taxes) month to month.    If you go with Comcast keep every service change/request and if you buy your own modem keep the receipt. They will try to charge or claim anything they can."

They were just trying to talk me into a bigger package. I can see if I was trying to run a million things on my net at the same time, but this is fine for now. They have good promotions, and they're pretty good about if you threaten to leave, they lower your price."

In my complex of 36 units, Centurylink is the way to go.  We started with Comcast and holy shit was it unbearably sloooow. Evenings, especially Sunday evenings, the speed would drop so much it would take a couple of minutes for standard YouTube videos to buffer.  Finally switched to Centurylink and haven't looked back after having them for over a year.  The fastest speed they offer is 12mbps down and we pay $19/month for it.  It's been 100% consistent, speedtest.net constantly shows that we're pulling between 11 and 14mbps.  A good day with Comcast was 4mbps  Plus if you're into torrenting, CL minds their own business and doesn't send letters accusing you of downloading stuff you're not supposed to and there are no data caps"

Also, my ping while connected via ethernet playing PS4 is somehow always 100-120 which baffles me.  I'm moving soon and going to try Century link.  edit: also i don't have cable tv, only netflix.  At night it sometimes struggles to play anything to the point where the program is pixelated and almost unwatchable.  Comcast claims there's nothing they can do about it.  Apparently expanding capacity is too much $$$$$ for a multi billion dollar company to do."

For shaving supplies Amazon man.  Check out /r/wickededge  I'm still using a standard Gilette Razor for now and Neutragina Shave Lotion.  It's pretty cheap ~$5 at WalMart.

Bring a cooler, some snacks, a few adult beverages and get some sun!  Oh:  Don't forget sunscreen either!    This event and the Bare Buns Fun Run (July 26th) have a great vibe...once you try this a few times, you'll be on board with it.  My wife and I did the fun runs for a few years when we first moved here and now we take vacations to Portland, Maui and Palm Springs just so we can be naked.  People around here don't realize how great we have it when it comes to nude recreation...there are wide swaths of 'Murica w/out any legal options to tan the hide.

Downtown parking is ROUGH and traffic after is HELL.  If you are positive you want to park downtown use the Parkade or River Front Mall parking garage."

Spokane,3c2cjl,zeldajones,6,Sun Jul 5 06:55:04 2015 UTC,Do NOT use the parkade unless you get downtown really early and park near the bottom and leave the show early too just to get to your car before everyone else. Parked on the top last year and it took until 2am literally just to get out onto the street outside the parkade. You would be better off to park on the other side of the park across the river by like the arena and walk into the park for the show.

Spokane,3c217m,curlymama,10,Sat Jul 4 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"I'll be the contrarian voice here and tell you West Central is an excellent choice.  There is no other neighborhood in Spokane that is undergoing such extreme revitalization (or gentrification, if you prefer).  If you choose selectively, and are willing to put in a little sweat equity, West Central offers the best opportunity for your property to double or even triple in value over the next ten years. IF you are careful, selective, and smart.  Sure 'Felony Flats' has some sketchy dumps and some white trash tweakers.  It also has Kendall Yards, which is the hippest little enclave in town--think Marietta in the '90s.  Condos in Kendall Yards are selling for twice the price of houses 3 blocks away.  West Central has easy access to the Centennial Trail, for biking, running or walking.  There is easy access to downtown and points north.  Caveat: I know nothing about the schools."
Spokane,3c217m,Spoklan,2,Sat Jul 4 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, these are the things we're interested in. We are actually hoping to purchase an old house and work on it ourselves. We picked our location here by accesability to bus lines and biking and we'll do so in Spokane. It's just one of those things that's important to us."
Spokane,3c217m,CinnamonJ,5,Sat Jul 4 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"First off, the crime you're likely to run into in Spokane isn't like the crime in Atlanta.  You're not gonna shot or anything.  That being said there are two areas of town that are basically in competition for being known as ""the bad part of town"", dogtown (on the northside) and felony flats (west central).  I grew up in dogtown and I would have picked west central any day of the week.  All the people who have lived in the expensive parts of town their entire lives are gonna tell you not to move there but if you're from Atlanta I really doubt anything in Spokane is gonna shock you.  The bottom line is, like you said, prices are very low and it is an extremely accessible area and there is a higher crime rate.  Do you have kids?  I would say the schools are a much bigger concern than the crime."
Spokane,3c217m,NPPraxis,4,Sat Jul 4 02:02:47 2015 UTC,Is dogtown = Hillyard?
Spokane,3c217m,CinnamonJ,2,Sat Jul 4 08:34:34 2015 UTC,It's in hillyard on the east side of the railroad tracks.
Spokane,3c217m,streetchicken,0,Sat Jul 4 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"where far less happens than some of the lateral area between market and crestline, though some of it sure is uglier."
Spokane,3c217m,CinnamonJ,0,Sat Jul 4 12:33:43 2015 UTC,Frankly I never thought it warranted any distinction from the rest of hillyard but everyone I went to school with sure thought it was worth pointing out!
Spokane,3c217m,No_U_Crazy,2,Sat Jul 4 12:38:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was wondering if this was the case. This Spring we've had 2 drive by's and some gang activity on our street (amongst the standard property crime), and we live in a good area.We've got an alternative school option worked out, so not worried there."
Spokane,3c217m,No_U_Crazy,6,Sat Jul 4 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"To echo what others have said.  Coming from big cities on the east coast, the crime here is laughable. I lived in DC and NYC and spent a LOT of time in Atlanta.  While property crime is very real in specific parts of the city, violent crime is extremely rare.  As well, coming from a place like Atlanta, you'll likely be vigilant enough not to be a target.  I keep hearing stories about cars being stolen from people's driveways here because they were left running to warm up in the morning.  Who leaves their effing car running with keys in it!!??  Lock your doors, don't leave your garage open, don't leave change in your cup holders, etc.  Just basic vigilance goes a million miles here where so many people are so lax.  You'll watch the news here and it's basically comedy.  Nothing happens that would scare you."

Wait until you get here and everyone thinks it's miserable outside when it's 95 with no humidity, no mosquitoes and no thunderstorms."
Spokane,3c217m,BoogerROTN,2,Mon Jul 6 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Lower South Hill might be your best bet - somewhere East of Perry will be relatively affordable, and you'll have access to better schools."

Spokane,3c217m,crosscountryloves,9,Sat Jul 4 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"People are going to tell you to move to the South Hill, primarily because that's been drilled into their heads since the local land/timber/railroad barons ran Spokane.  It's pricey, the lots are tiny, the houses are older (read:  higher maintenance) and you have to commute for shopping because South Hill residents tend to want stores in other people's neighborhoods.  I think the South Hill ""lifestyle"" is a bit of Seattle parody...but that's just my opinion.  That said, affordable options are going to be in sketchier neighborhoods.  You'll see some great flippers on the various realtor websites, but they don't tend to show the run down dumps next door or the El Camino on concrete blocks across the street.    When we moved here from PA, we ended up on the ""northside.""  I laugh at that, as everybody seems to think the ""northside"" is everything from the river north to Canada.  In reality, the seedier parts of north central Spokane run from the river to Wellesley, though there is evidence of ""white trash creep"" moving towards Francis.  The house we bought was in the Linwood neighborhood (north of Francis), which was still in pretty decent shape at the time.  We bought a 1900sqft brick rancher w/2-car garage, fenced yard and a new roof for $170K back in '06.  Also, it was right next to a school;  not the greatest school, but I blame that more on parents not being engaged with their kids rather than the teachers or school district.  One thing I will bring up is busing.  The middle school and high school boundaries for District 81 are screwed up, IMO.  Our old house was a five minute drive to Shadle Park H.S., but because of the stupid boundaries, my kids would have had to take a long bus ride to North Central H.S.  This was a major reason why we sold and moved further north, to Mead (where the schools are awesome).  Good luck with your house hunting."
Spokane,3c217m,No_U_Crazy,6,Sat Jul 4 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"You completely nailed everything I find questionable about recommending people live on the south hill.  To add some finer points to your explanation of the lower north side: It's really kind of a block by block thing. There's several chunks of area between the river and wellesley that are seedy, somewhat seedy, not seedy at all, somewhat nice, and wow what the hell are these houses doing here?  West Central might be one of the seedier areas of town, but it's not a very large area and within a block of it are a lot of really nice homes.  Someone coming from Atlanta should have zero problems, comparatively, no matter where in town they live."

I did the research when we moved here a couple years ago. Test scores here = parental involvement and teachers who are well supported by the administration. There are good schools elsewhere in the city but South Hill has great schools. If you don't get districted for the school you want, apply for one of charter schools (we don't have magnet schools here).  West Central is not great but it's not terrible either. I lived there 13 years ago and it's not the same as it once was...in a good way. It's as old as the south hill. They built a new development right on the edge of that and downtown called Kendall Yards. Maybe get an apartment there for the first year and take some time to explore around you. Check out places like Perry, top of the south hill, Shadle and neighborhoods off Country Homes. You won't really know until you get here.   We lived in an apartment downtown (Madison Monroe Mgmt)  for a couple years before we moved to the south hill. We love our neighbors, the wildlife (turkey's squirrels and neighborhood cats) and our kids school. It was a good fit - house we could afford, needs a little work but had AC, was on a bus line and was centrally located to downtown (seriously everywhere in Spokane took less than 15min when it's not rush hour.)   Enjoy! Spokane is a great place to live."
Spokane,3c217m,CancerAndCookies,3,Sat Jul 4 15:16:43 2015 UTC,I live pretty much in the middle of west central and have never had an issue with crime in the 3 years here. I bought my 3 bedroom house for 80 grand and have put no work into it at all. West central is also very different block by block. I might have lucked out. Being so close to downtown you can ride a bike everywhere. I think west central is a great investment opportunity if you can find the right house.
Spokane,3c217m,crosscountryloves,4,Sat Jul 4 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"The houses here are cheaper, but it is for a reason. If you're looking to buy, be aware of what you're getting into. 100+ year old houses for the most part with old systems and often poorly insulated if at all. This translates to sky high electric bills and being uncomfortable cold or hot depending on the season. Check with Avista on their website for high/low/average prices on any property you're looking at in spokane, old houses especially. Your electric bill can often negate any savings you have on rent/mortgage. I've known people with $500 month bills in the winter. And when the difference between living in a neighborhood where you are nervous walking to your car at night, living in an old house that needs maker work and youhave to be VIGILANT about not leaving anything in your car can be as little as a couple hundred bucks a month, you may decide it's not worth it. Just depends how tight money is.  The neighborhood is bad-for spokane. Lots of property crimes, we really don't have a lot of violent crime. There was a drive by a few years back and it was a pretty big deal. They call it felony flats for a reason. Look on the state sex offender registry list and you will see that is a popular area.  That being said, if you can, drive through the area. Some blocks really look okay, some look like they've been abandoned. The blocks with a lot of cheap rentals versus the blocks that are owner occupied are generally obvious. Some blocks have very limited parking. And the closer you are to downtown the more vagrants you will see.   I did stalk your previous posts and saw that one of your issues is your child. As bad as this may sound, I would stay out of west central simply because of that. You are likely to get neighbors who are not as, progressive? in this neighborhood. I don't want to scare away because this really is a decent place to, but I would actually get a hold of some of the LGBT groups in the area and ask them about places to live. We still are a relatively small big town and can be very churchy. I would think that area like the Perry district might be a better fit. It is going through revitilization and there is a younger and more progressive/potentially accepting type demographic moving in. It's more like what west central could be in 20 years if they keep working on it. Same problems, old houses, car break ins, but it's up and coming. Lots of work being done, and a nice little neighbor commercial area's.  The northwest area is also pretty decent. From the west side of Audubon park to Francis west of Maple.  Look on this crime nap, it'll give you a good idea. And the you can often find cheaper houses in that area.  http://spokane.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3ad764a4c721463a88e7e3132b61eb69  There is a once a month play group that you might be interested in.  http://www.marybethmarkham.com/TransgenderCare.en.html  Good luck"
Spokane,3c217m,pie_zzi,2,Sat Jul 4 04:16:24 2015 UTC,"I could not agree with you more about your assessment of felony flats. I lived just off the corner of Mallon and Chestnut for about seven years. Lived next to gangbangers, meth addicts, drug houses, you name it. Had our house broken in to. Was sexually assaulted. My brothers and sisters went to Holmes and couldn't shake lice.  North Central is under funded and looks like a prison.   South Perry has had great revitalisation as has downtown and the Valley is also a pretty great place to live. North Spokane has gorgeous fifties houses with basements. There are great communities all over the place but I would really avoid West Central unless you enjoy felons and sex offenders and the occasional SWAT team raid."
Spokane,3c217m,pie_zzi,2,Sat Jul 4 06:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hey!  west central is coming around! :) I'm new to the area too, but my new boss lives in felony flats. She loves it because of the revitalization there.   I'm originally from Pittsburgh, most recently from Denver/Colorado Springs. The crime here is not like the east coast. Your car will probably get broken into. You probably won't be shot in the street.   We bought a great starter home in NevaWood (northside) for around ~122k. It had a bunch of work done on it - new plumbing, electrical, flooring, roof, etc. I feel safe here. I have a few seedy neighbors, but I'm not gonna get shot and die. Most of my neighbors are old enough to be my grandparents, and I love it here. There's a couple mostly-move-in-ready homes for sale, down a few blocks from me. We are close to the hospital, a school, a couple city parks (they have splash pads, which is great in the heat!), and it really never takes more than 15 minutes to get anywhere.   I like this neighborhood.   Oh, and our house was originally built in 1911. So if you wanna buy something with character or whatever, maybe try NevaWood too. West Central will definitely be on the upswing though (I think)."

In fact one of my favourite things to do was date night at an AMC dine-in theater, guaranteed crowd of adults only (comfy, pretty decent food, good experience overall)  It seems that Spokane and the associated mindset may just not be for you.

The Spokane Tribe has entered into an agreement with Hard Rock, but Governor Inslee has to approve of the plans before anything can actually happen.

Spokane,3bqyfs,purplehoney,8,Wed Jul 1 13:01:42 2015 UTC,"Dams provide cheap, non-carbon emitting energy.  Without them, it would be impossible to farm in central Washington or use barges on the Columbia river.  Tearing them down has more negative environmental impacts than positive ones."
Spokane,3bqyfs,AGlassOfMilk,4,Wed Jul 1 23:55:28 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're being downvoted. The primary reason they built grand coulee was to provide water to central Washington farms.
Spokane,3bqyfs,c-honda,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"While dams provide us with some of the cheapest power in the nation, we have to weigh each dams effectiveness against the damage to our fish populations. Considering the food needs of our ever expanding society, I really hope there will be sufficient steelhead and salmon for future generations.  So the debate is this - which dams have outlived their usefulness? Are there other forms of energy worth investing in that have less environmental consequences? I'd love to hear more pro-dam arguments as well as the opposing ideas."

Spokane,3bqyfs,johnnythornton,2,Thu Jul 2 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"FISH ARE NOT THAT USEFUL.  Honestly, wtf are you talking about man? How often do you eat fish vs. how often do you eat grain products?  Plus, we're getting better about proper fish ladders.  Seriously though, fish populations?"
Spokane,3bqyfs,AGlassOfMilk,3,Sat Jul 4 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"Damage to the fish population?  What about the damage to the environment if we replace the hydroelectric power the dams produce with coal or natural gas?  What about the damage to the environment from removing the barges on the Columbia river and replacing them with trucks?  Hydroelectric is the only carbon-neutral power generation source (other than nuclear) that can cover the base load of a grid.  Wind and solar can't.  Every time we tear down a dam we have to build a coal power plant to cover the base load.  And as for our food needs, removing the dams would spell disaster for farming in Washington state.  Grant county would turn into a desert.  Our fish populations are sustainable due to our network of hatcheries.  Your concern future generations of salmon runs is baseless."
Spokane,3bqyfs,AGlassOfMilk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:56:05 2015 UTC,"Do not mistake this as an ""all or nothing"" debate - there are dams which are useful in more ways than creating power, like irrigation and flood protection. That much is already clear. Not all dams need be destroyed. The awareness that needs to happen is for the locations that have outlived their usefulness; some have gathered decades of sediment, producing less power and disrupting the ecosystem. Also, fish hatcheries and other protection systems are very expensive to maintain. When does it become more valuable to research into other forms of power? It may be more expensive now, but would pay off long after we have passed this earth."
Spokane,3bqyfs,dadadaCHIEFS,3,Thu Jul 2 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"The awareness that needs to happen is for the locations that have outlived their usefulness   No dam has outlived its usefulness as long as coal power plants exist.  Specifically, the four Snake River dams listed on the website that Damnation wants removed (Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite) don't have problems.  They are all useful, and generate over 3 GW of carbon-neutral power.   When does it become more valuable to research into other forms of power?   Like what?  What magical form of power do you think we can come up with?  If you think it will be solar and wind, think again.  These sources don't cover base load.  Furthermore, the number of acres that would be required to generate the same amount of power that a single dam does with solar or wind would devastate whole ecosystems significantly more than a dam with a properly working fish ladder would.   It may be more expensive now, but would pay off long after we have passed this earth.   Which would you choose: a return of natural rivers and fish runs or avoiding Climate Change?  Which will really pay off long after we have passed this earth?"
Spokane,3bqyfs,AGlassOfMilk,-1,Thu Jul 2 07:52:52 2015 UTC,Barges don't move along the Columbia like the old days. It's not cost effective anymore.
Spokane,3bqyfs,librariansguy,2,Fri Jul 3 15:32:33 2015 UTC,You are incorrect. Millions of tons of cargo is still moved by barges on the Columbia river.  If it weren't cost effective companies would have switched to rail or truck by now.
Spokane,3bqyfs,FranktheShank1,2,Fri Jul 3 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather have the dams than coal-fired power plants.    I watched this movie last night based on OP's recommendation.  It wasn't a documentary so much as a propaganda piece.  There was hardly any discussion about what benefits the dams provide, just ""dams are bad 'cause fish"" over and over again.    This was about as fair and balanced as a FOX News segment on the merits of Bernie Sanders' political ideology.  Different political angle, but the same propogandist tactics."

My favorite far spot is Sullivan Lake. Super secluded and beautiful water. Its a mountain Lake so you see Mountain goats on the hills everywhere. Bad bear and Cougar area though.   Alberts is fun for kids. Swimming in the creek. Rope swing. Store near by. Easy access. Electricity. Have fun camping!

I don't know if he had too many patients on his schedule, but the little amount of time I had with him barely covered any of my ailments or health problems.

You can find instructors through them.  My daughter is currently in the second level trying out for the third.  It's a fantastic program."
Spokane,3beu0x,MissMalificent,2,Sun Jun 28 22:37:19 2015 UTC,Thank you all for the great advice and comments! It is really appreciated.  I had an interview today and it sounds like I will get an offer. Hopefully it is good enough to make the big move!! :
Spokane,3beu0x,holla5050,2,Wed Jul 1 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"So I received a job offer with a salary of $62,400. I also will have 100% medical for my family of four. I am pretty sure I am going to accept the offer. My huge concern is walking away from a much larger salary and bonuses (I made 133k last year). The thing is the cost of living here is outrageous so I should be able to have a similar lifestyle in Spokane with the pay. Looking for some reassurance from all of you fine Spokane folks that we will be fine with my salary there and love it. ;) the new job will be much less stress and responsibilty also and hopefully give me a better work life balance.  We also will have a decent down payment on a home from equity that we made on our mobile home here... yeah, the housing market is so crazy in silicon valley that our mobile home in a trailer park nearly doubled in value over 3 years. Now I need the cajones to crush my current employer with the news... :/ no fun   Thanks again for all the advice, hope to meet some of you if/when we make it to Spokane!"
Spokane,3beu0x,holla5050,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:43:11 2015 UTC,Congrats on the job offer! I think you'll be fine on that salary especially with 100% medical (I wish we had that!) Money isn't everything and it is worth taking a pay cut for a better work/life balance.  Spokane is really a great place to raise your family. Good luck with everything! Feel free to ask any other questions/plan a meet up when you get here!  edit: spelling
Spokane,3beu0x,holla5050,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:53:10 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Ugh. I am really having a rough time deciding now after more thought. We are planning a trip soon to see if that makes up my mind.
Spokane,3beu0x,holla5050,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:42:06 2015 UTC,That sounds like a great idea. My hubby came up here to do his final interview and check the area out before we made the decision to move. I had some doubts (because I wasn't able to visit before we moved) BUT I am so glad we made the move out of Vegas. Spokane/Spokane Valley is a great place to live and to raise kids.

But we have been having a tough time finding a home like you said you were. Also a big concern we are having, not to sound judgmental or shallow, is that we have seen some very questionable parenting and some ""different"" people and lots of cigarette smoking. These are things that exist everywhere but it really stood out for us today.  We were expecting to feel like we would relate more to the people as I am from Western WA and my wife from Montana. We are hoping tomorrow gives us a better feeling... and we find some places we like. How is your house hunt going?  Any insight or encouragement welcome... LOL."
Spokane,3beu0x,blushingpervert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:20:40 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I just wrote a super long response and my phone erased it. Let's try this again!  Yes there are definitely some ""interesting"" people here but that's the case anywhere. It is way different than where you guys are from so it's probably a bit of culture shock. I know the feeling! It took a while for me to get acclimated but what really helped was living at my hubby's hotel for 5 weeks and getting to explore the area slowly while we decided where we wanted to live. We moved here because we wanted good schools for the kids and a ""normal"" place compared to Vegas so we picked the Valley because of the school district more specifically for the actual school that my daughter goes to so looking anywhere but the valley wasn't an option for us. I highly recommend finding something in Central Valley School District. We are renting now and looking for houses. It might take a while but that's okay since we want to find the right one for us. I want something relatively close to my kid's schools - they go to preschool on Pines & 14th and grade school off McDonald.  Okay suggestions on where to look - first of all, stay SOUTH of I-90. North of I-90 is a different school district, you have to cross 2 sets of busy train tracks, traffic backs up a lot and I just don't really care for any of the areas over there except Northwoods neighborhood in Millwood. In the south valley, you might like the area near Terrace View park. We have a friend who lives over there and loves it. We just put an offer in on a house over there but didn't get it, boo. Another friend has a beautiful new house off Sullivan and 24th - lots of nature, deer, etc but within minutes of stores and schools. You might like Liberty Lake. It reminds me a lot of CA especially the new subdivisions. Not an option for us because it is out of our price range but many people love it. I have a friend who is from Orange County CA who lives in Liberty Lake and loves loves loves it. You could check out Greenacres - there are a lot of new subdivisions with young families there. It has more of a country feel that a lot of people like. You might also want to check out Post Falls and Coeur d'Alene. CDA is beautiful and I love the feel of the town BUT it is far from my hubby's work. I have a friend from high school who lives there and loves it.  I hope that helps a little bit. It's kinda hard to recommend areas since I don't know your budget but I'm trying. Please PM me if you have any other questions! I am totally partial to the valley because that is where I live but there are a lot of other nice areas in Spokane.  I would totally offer to play tour guide today but we promised the kiddos we'd go swimming at the river today."
Spokane,3beu0x,Skitterin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"I recently moved back here as well. I don't know about activities as I am still learning the area but my husband and I have 3 kids (7,5, and 1) and we'd be open to meet up."
Spokane,3beu0x,pie_zzi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"There are great programs for kids here if you look for them. There is the YMCA, and many public parks with pools that teach swimming lessons. Most public school programs here are decent especially in the area you are looking Central Valley and University High Schools are the fancier schools in the valley with amazing arts,drama, and music programs. They also have more advance technology programs than some of the other public schools. I attended East Valley which was a good school they have decent programs but I feel like CV and U-High will help your children really excell. There are also many boy scouts and girl scouts troops in the area, many lakes and outdoor activities available. Mountains everywhere great for learning to ski or snowboard. There are ice skating rinks, and Roller rinks, skate board parks, and water parks, and even theme parks only a fair distance away. Basically I grew up here and it is a great place to give kids the opportunity to learn and take part in a variety of different activities and learn what they like to do and not be limited by weather or income. As for the cost of living it's not the best but I can only imagine it's better than CA. Depending on what you do one income for a family of 4 will be enough to provide a decent living here. I grew up with my brother on only my single mothers income and we managed pretty well. It's a good family place and a good choice I've lived here my whole life and while I plan on traveling a little but I still plan on settling down here one day too. Good luck and best wishes to you and your family!"
Spokane,3beu0x,holla5050,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"I would say for the areas you listed $50k would be bare bones. $75k comfortable in spots. $100k in liberty lake, if your good with your money. Just bought a house in the valley and was shopping around. Those were all estimates of what I feel would be enough. You may find a good deal but 2 months ago any decent houses had accepted bids within 48hours."

The gymnastics place has a parkour class too!  Also, check out the corbin arts center classes that they offer. Always something fun! and the mobius membership is super reasonable and great. Plus theres 2 great places for ice skating lessons and year round youth ice hockey."
Spokane,3beu0x,Animum_Rege,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"Plenty of things for kids to do. Gymnastics, multiple sports associations for just about every mainstream sport. Pools just opened for the summer! Although with the cuts to funding you do have to wonder why they opened mid/late June after the weather has already been in the 90's to 100's. Defined seasons, I come from the Seattle area originally and I love the fact that it's not just rain, overcast skies and very mild seasons, in most cases. I would say $60,000 to $75,000 would very a comfortable income depending on how extravagant your house will be. Well sure there's young families. I'm 28, my wife is 27, and we have two kids, 8 and 5."

Spokane,3bew35,snk50,11,Sun Jun 28 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"Do not do that! Pets use fur to help control their body temperature and shaving it off will fuck it up. Cats like heat and I can guarantee you they have no issues. If anything they probably like it. Mine lays by the window all days and soaks it in. There is nothing you need to do, just make sure they have access to water is all."

I moved from the Central Valley about three years ago, and I can say unconditionally that it was the best decision I have made. The thing that is crazy about Spokane is you can be in the city, and 20 minutes later as you are headed south from Spokane Valley you are in farm country with rolling hills and alfalfa everywhere. If you decide to go north, you're in the mountains, and there is no and great places to ski. If you decide to head over to Coeur d'Alene, which is about 35 minutes away, you have lakes upon lakes to go and do fun stuff on."

Spokane,3b8mue,Noir_,2,Sat Jun 27 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Spokane is surrounded by famland and scab lands (all the brown you were seeing), but we're right by the Spokane River, so things are green and we've got a lot of pine trees. Spokane is also less than an hour's drive to a lot of great foresty hiking areas. Big Rock is a favorite of mine.  We're certainly not as green as Portland or Seattle, but we've got our green. The river is nice. I'm actually going tubing on it in a week or so.  As far as a good place to start a family, I think Spokane is pretty good. I believe the majority of the crime here is nonviolent (lots of smashed car windows), and the school districts seem pretty good. As far as starting a career, that'll depend on the field. Spokane doesn't have tons and tons of job openings, but if you're in a high demand field, it shouldn't be a problem. Spokane is growing and it's a really exciting time to be here.  As far as the night sky, it's a pretty typical city night sky, with most stars being blocked out by light pollution, but the amount of stars blocked is less so than what you might be used to.  I should also mention that cost of living is pretty low in Spokane when compared to the rest of the western side of the state."

Spokane,3b82hd,k_princess,5,Fri Jun 26 18:49:01 2015 UTC,Pedestrians and cars seem to be out of sync in Spokane. It seems drivers forget what it is like to be a pedestrian the moment they get behind the wheel and pedestrians forget what it is like to be a driver the moment they get to an intersection.   The Gonzaga area has horrible pedestrians that seem to think they can step into traffic without stopping and looking both ways and the rest of Spokane has horrible drivers that seem to think they don't need to stop at crosswalks.   Every pedestrian needs to remember to try to make eye contact before stepping in front of a car. Make sure the driver sees you.   Every driver needs to be on the lookout for pedestrians and they need to stop and let people cross.   Just a few weeks ago while standing at a crosswalk waiting for traffic to stop a driver actually waved and laughed at me while driving his jacked up suburban past me.    Spokane seems to be getting more and more inconsiderate and entitled citizens every day. Don't be one of them.

Spokane,3b7knr,manfly,3,Fri Jun 26 21:06:17 2015 UTC,Um... Why?    Because it's the best cheaper end beer out there.  Why does OP need a reason?
Spokane,3b7knr,manfly,4,Sat Jun 27 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"I like your post. This beer snobbery needs to end (douche bags like the top comment ""Um why!?!?!""). Beer snobs and the ""Craft beer movement"" is getting about as pretentious and over the top as wine connoisseurs have a rep for.  Anyway, I've seen bottled Ranier at Monterey Cafe downtown. In fact there's a few ""lower end"" bars downtown that have it.  Lion's Lair downtown also used to have it on tap but I haven't been in since new ownership took over.  Forget PBR, both Ranier and Olympia are the tits when it comes to cheap beer."
Spokane,3b7knr,fuelnerd,2,Fri Jun 26 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"I love craft beer, but there are days that I just say, ""Fuck it, I want an Oly,"" or ""Give me a Budweiser. I want some beechwood aging."" I love beer because it's beer. :)  I found Rainier in college, a couple years after they closed the brewery in Seattle, but before Tully's ruined a landmark. I did it initially because it was different than all the people drinking Busch Light (I don't think hipsters were a thing yet), but found that I really preferred it over the other options. Also, they brewed in Spokane into the 60s so that's added coolness!"

I agree about craft beer, but goddamn am I over this new wave beer snobbery.  Like you said, beer is beer, even if it's cheap swill.  I'm getting to a point where I've ""overdosed"" on the craft beer, it's just so fucking heavy and rich, that more and more these days I just want something light, cheap, and watery. Although maybe that's the summer heat talking, too."

I'd say that Spokane is a small and conservative Seattle/Portland hybrid only a little behind PNW trends. Minimum wage is high due to the state and cost of living is low. Spokane's loves its chain restaurants, but there are also local gems all over town. Winters here are manageable if you're like me, who moved here from the desert. Every other season is amazing.

I moved here from Houston about five years ago and was surprised when I realized how white it is. It has some great restaurants, decent shopping, great microbreweries, but lacks industry to draw in well-educated twentysomethings. They seem to flee for thriving metropolises after college.

Spokane,3b062x,Datguydab,5,Wed Jun 24 22:23:12 2015 UTC,I love Aloha Island Grill's teriyaki sauce. It's so good!
Spokane,3b062x,pinajo,2,Thu Jun 25 13:59:26 2015 UTC,"This place^  Their Hawaiian teriyaki is awesome!  On a side note, I think I've found out how to replicate it fairly close.   1 cup soy sauce note use only Aloha soy sauce, which can be found in most stores around the other soy sauces 1 cup sugar 1 tsp grated ginger, very fine (I have been using dehydrated stuff, and just dicing it fine) 1 large garlic glove, minced 3 scallions, chopped fine   Instructions:  1 - Mix soy and sugar in small sauce pain over low heat, just enough to dissolve sugar.  Remove from heat and add remaining ingredients.  2 - Let cool and store in a glass jar in fridge.  That's it.  It's pretty easy to make and holds a good month or more in the fridge."
Spokane,3b062x,Geawiel,3,Thu Jun 25 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"Kim's is the place I've been going to, but probably just because I'm a north spokanite.   When you find the good teriyaki joint let us know!  I can only give you advice you didn't ask for, but you must try out the Thai place called Phonthip on Francis. No it's not teriyaki. Yes it's damn good!"
Spokane,3b062x,djchazradio,2,Thu Jun 25 09:30:38 2015 UTC,Phontip is the best Thai in town in my opinion.  Linnies and Thai on first are also up there.

This is very unlike her, and though I have spent hours calling and driving around I have not had any luck finding her. She is fixed so she is no good for breeding, and the most she does is growl at another dog if they get too close, so she would suck at fighting. She had TPL surgery on her back left leg in March, but she has recovered so well you wouldn't know it to look at her. If anyone sees or hears anything, please let me know. We love her and want her back home.  One picture is of her when my dad initially brought her home, she has lost a lot of weight since then and should be around a healthy 60 lbs"

Spokane,3augwb,ayriana,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"Care Credit is a financial services company owned by GE (though soon to be divested);  they offer instant financing at rates better than a C/C, with only a short form and usually no income verification.  It's used by veterinarians, dentists and the occasional GP and is completely legitimate.    As far as payments, I can't speak for other clinics, but we hate to do it simply because we've been burned in the past.  If someone discontinues the agreement, it essentially involves taking them to small claims court;  usually they don't respond to the summons, so you get a summary judgment...and no way to collect upon it.  If you employ a collection agency to obtain the bad debt, you get pennies on the dollar and risk a lawsuit from the deadbeat if the collection agency is particularly aggressive.  Having went through this process a few times, it's just not worth it to us and we tend to push Care Credit as the solution.  Mind you, we pay a premium on this:  I believe it's 9%, which means we lose money every time a client uses it.  I wish you luck in finding a clinic that will make an agreement with you, but I would recommend Care Credit if you can qualify."

The Red Lion is close to both the Arena, and to downtown, in fact its right on the northern edge of Riverfront Park which is downtown, so for nightlife you would be just minutes away. Its probably the closest to the Arena too, though there are a few other hotels not far off. The Ruby is pretty nice I hear. I have heard some  pretty good things about it.  Totally redone recently. It is in downtown so you would be really close to nightlife there. Here is a link which may help with other info and questions you may have. www.visitspokane.com"

Keep in mind that if you show your Alberta Driver's Licence when shopping, you don't have to pay state tax!  You will have to pay tax on lodging and meals however.

They restaurant looked good, I didn't eat there but its somewhat on the higher end. Had a nice bar and there is a Starbucks in the lobby too. Rooms are awesome. You have a 55 inch Samsung 4 k ultra high definition tv to watch. Beds are very comfy, and there is an automatic window shade that has a remote and a wall button for operation. Onsite parking as well. I love this hotel. The location is awesome. Right across from Riverfront Park.  Close to shopping and some great restaurants. But, they do have some kinks to work out yet, but knowing Walt Worthy, the owner, they will do this!!  If there is anything else about the hotel you wish to ask, let me know!"

I toured one of the new rooms yesterday - amazing and I loved that they are getting rid of the stupid sofa beds/rollaway beds and are including hidden murphy beds in the rooms. So nice!   The location is spectacular - super close to the arena and walking distance to downtown. Food is great thanks to their fancy new chef and I think they are reasonably priced. They offer a free airport shuttle and it will take you places within 2 miles of the hotel as well. They do offer free bike rentals for guests, have a super fun outdoor pool (which won't be open in March), and again it's super close to the arena.   Red Lion River Inn is another hotel from the same brand just down the street - further from the arena but still walkable. Not nearly as nice but price is cheaper.

I'm happy with both the pieces themselves, but my experience with Missing Piece was infinitely better than Anchored Art. At Anchored Art, the artist just didn't really seem there. He showed up late for the appointment (which was the first of the day), rushed a bit through the consultation phase (it was admittedly a very easy tattoo, just a black silhouette, not even any shading), and then when I was done, he didn't cover it. I think he just forgot, as crazy as that seems, and I know I should've said something, but I just thought that he must know what he was doing. I ended up just wrapping it myself when I got home for a few hours. I have pets and didn't want to get hair in it or anything.   Meanwhile, the folks at Missing Piece were all warm and welcoming and made me feel really comfortable.  Both shops are very clean and sanitary and all that. I'd just think more about which artist you'd like.  I also like the artists' portfolios at Mom's Tattoos, but I haven't been there yet, so I can't vouch for anything."

When we moved, we went to the VCA Manito Animal Hospital thinking we would get the same care. Their hours suck and their vet   said things that made me want to pull my hair out.   We now go to the Regal Veterinary Clinic. They have better hours and they care (they call back, will follow-up and email results).  Although at this point, I'm starting to feel all vets are like mechanics. After a rough calculation of our vet bills, the total is more than one of our cars. We don't even spend half as much on our own health."

Dr Greg is one of the nicest and most caring veterinarians you will ever meet! When we made the heart wrenching decision to put down one of our best friends, Dr Greg made a house call so we didn't have to needlessly stress out our dog during his last moments with us. He did it for our neighbor as well. Not sure if this is the norm in the business but I was truly touched by his compassionate service."
Spokane,3ahb5o,BoogerROTN,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:03:31 2015 UTC,"I've been dealing with Dr Wada a lot lately.  I've got a cat who has stomatitis and she's the best at extractions.  Last week we took him in to have his canines removed as our last vet took out all the rest a couple years ago.  They put him under and discovered it was more complicated than they had anticipated and decided not to do the surgery.  I'm really glad that she decided to hand it off to a specialist because there is a high chance of breaking his jaw with canine extractions.  But then we had techs and other vets coming out to the lobby where we were waiting and apologizing for not being able to get the teeth out.  When they brought him out even the tech was getting emotional.  Dr Wada cleaned his remaining teeth really well, and flushed out an abscess, and didn't charge us for the dental.  It seemed like they felt bad for taking our money, so at least they were going to do something with him under."
Spokane,3ahb5o,aintsuperstitious,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"AAHA simply means you agree to pay a fee (including an annual licensing fee) to have the ""AAHA"" certification process done, much like the BBB accreditation.  Once you meet their standard (think ISO 9001), you can advertise with it and purchase additional marketing products from them.     Many, if not most, small animal clinics with only 1-2 doctors won't meet AAHA accreditation simply because they can't afford the process.  It's squarely aimed at $1M+/annual clinics, so I would take AAHA with a grain of salt...it's a bit like Angie's List."

That being said, my personal favorite: Leave a car at the TJ Meenach bridge and then launch out of Peaceful Valley by the Sandifur Bridge.  It's about a three-four hour float with a nice mix of calm stretches and some small rapid areas, not to mention some beach areas you can pull over for a beverage of your choice and an abandoned railroad bridge that you can jump off of.  Be sure to wear a life-jacket and to watch out for rocks in the rapids (it's really easy to hit your tailbone).   If you want to stretch out the float even longer, you can launch from Glover Park near the west side of Peaceful Valley (which adds about an hour), or park your car past TJ Meenach at the entrance of the disc golf park near Riverside state park (which adds an additional hour). Be careful with this one, because unlike parking at TJ Meenach there is no obvious landmark that you're at the end of the trip, and if you don't get out at the right time eventually you would run into the rapids at Bowl & Pitcher, which would not be a fun time.   TL;DR: launch from the peaceful valley area, be safe, 3 hours later get out at TJ Meenach bridge."
