caps,3e2l02,biffbobsen,5,Tue Jul 21 15:54:40 2015 UTC,Come on guys I thought 8 was our favorite number
caps,3e2l02,petrydish,4,Tue Jul 21 19:20:29 2015 UTC,If everyone knows this is a common negotiation tactic then how does it still work?
caps,3e2l02,biger93,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:51 2015 UTC,Because it still works. Every single retail store does this. Do they really expect to sell that shirt for $100? Hell no. But a hell of a lot more people will buy it when it is marked down 50% from $100 instead of just marking it $50 from the start. Perception matters.
caps,3e2l02,petrydish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:48:53 2015 UTC,The way I see it is Holtby realized we wouldn't pay $100 for him then marked himself up to like $125 lol I just don't see it working out in holtby a favor I bet arbitration gets him around 6. We're going to give him whatever the number happens to arrive at regardless. If he has another vezina caliber season and a deep playoff run however that 8 mil might start looking like a possibility for him and for a longer term too. I hope we can afford that
caps,3e2l02,scrubversive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:24:58 2015 UTC,"The same way haggling has always worked. One side sets the minimum, the other side sets the maximum, and then both sides make their case for the real value of the merchandise (the player's projected ability to contribute). The tactical move is to start unreasonably high so that there is a lot of room to negotiate down from.  If Holtby&Co set an expectation for wanting the originally reported $6.5m going into arbitration, then settling in the middle at $5.8m would look like a reasonable compromise for all. If they say $8m, $6.5m becomes the expectation for compromise."
caps,3e2l02,petrydish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:59 2015 UTC,if the caps also realize this though then why would they not just stick to the 5.8? if he said he wanted 8 mil to start out with then it would make more sense. but he realized we weren't going to meet him at 6.5 and then raised to 8 so i still don't think that should mean we go and meet him at 6.5
caps,3e2l02,roadslaya,7,Tue Jul 21 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"Thank god they will go to Arbitration. That is 500k less then Lundqvist. Holtby has been good for the Caps, he shows up in the playoffs but he is not an 8 million /yr player. He doesn't have a Stanley Cup, nor does he have a Vezina. The top 4/5 players (in salary) have won that trophy short of Pekka Rinne who has been a finalist almost every year. Furthermore, last season was his first full season where he didn't split the duties in net with someone. He ran good numbers, but was that because of Holtby or because of Trotz and the revamped Defense which is now one of the best in the league? MA Fleury and Jon Quick both have cups but still sit in the 5-6 mil range and I think that is where Holtby belongs. I can't blame the dude for wanting to get paid but IF he wants the cup he's gonna have to take a cut in the salary cap era."
caps,3e2l02,UnsungZer0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"He wasn't asking for this much until he filed for arbitration.  He wants 6.5, and asking for 8 will put that 6.5 right in the middle."
caps,3e2l02,roadslaya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:01 2015 UTC,I think even that is too high. I didn't see he was asking for that # before arbitration. What I listed above is what the caps org will probably bring to the table during arbitration regardless. Hopefully feelings don't get destroyed and it's handled professionally.
caps,3e2l02,frbastiat,4,Tue Jul 21 20:09:29 2015 UTC,Its just a number to throw out to get a high counter. No way he expects to get 8mil.

caps,3e2l02,foggell44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"He doesn't actually want 8 million, this just forces a counter offer to be higher"
caps,3e2l02,christianitie,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is if as people say, it makes sense for Holtby's agent to make an unreasonable offer, why wouldn't GMBM pitch it much lower than what he wants?  GMBM's offer seems completely reasonable to me, Holtby's offer just makes no sense.  Honestly, when I heard before that he wanted $6 I thought it was too much, at least for long-term.  I'm sure this isn't a popular opinion, but I think if he gets more than six then it makes sense to try to trade him if an opportunity opens up - we have great goalie prospects, we would free up a ton of cap, and we might be able to get a good haul given how he's been playing of late."
caps,3e2l02,Danjiks88,4,Wed Jul 22 00:37:06 2015 UTC,"If that would mean that he's getting 6.5 mil just because it's half between 5 and 8, then caps would also go in arbitration with a 2 mil offer. to counter that. This is so blown out of proportion by Holts agent and is getting ridiculously annoying. Holtby had a good season. A season. And he's asking for money that requires you to be elite. Where's the guarantee that he won't go down in his performance next season or the season after that? One season does not prove anything. I know it's all business and so on, but knowing Capitals Cap situation Holts should've signed for 5.1 or 5.3 mil for 3-4 seasons to prove that he's worth those 6-7 mil. He'd have a contract with the team he says he loves, and he'd give this team the chance to acquire players they need. Goaltending is a big part of it, but it doesn't stop there. I don't know how much a player is involved in the negotiations, but honestly I'm getting really pissed at him for being so greedy."
caps,3e2l02,Jinkajury,3,Tue Jul 21 20:00:58 2015 UTC,Does this arbitration put tension on the relationship between Holtby and management? What about Holtby and the rest of the team? Or is everyone aware this is just another part of the business and think nothing of it?
caps,3e2l02,zprice23,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Holtby wants to stay in Washington and the Caps want him to be the goalie of the future. But this is a business. Holtby has put up great numbers in the playoffs and just had a superb regular season. Therefore Holts wants to get as much as he can because he feels he deserves it. He knows the Caps cap situation and he knows that he won't make 8 MIL a year. My guess is that Holtby and his agent want around 7 MIL, which TBH and it might be the unpopular opinion, I'd give it to him for 4-5 years.   If Holtby continues to play like he did last season and in the playoffs, he'll ask for 8-8.5 mil a year when his contract is up. At that point, the Caps would need to look at their goaltending depth, which I believe to be pretty damn good, and see if paying Holts that much makes sense."
caps,3e2l02,enlighteningbug,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:18 2015 UTC,It's a negotiation tactic plain and simple. Aim higher than you deserve so you can get what you actually wanted in the first place. I'm not worried.
caps,3e2l02,ChainsawChuck,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"This is how arbitration works people. I have no doubt that that Holtby is fully aware that he won't be getting $8 million. The entire point of this is to find a fair number for both sides, and both sides arrive at that through the arbitrator by aiming as low or high as they can. We'll get him signed for a good number."
caps,3e2l02,Caps4lifeov8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:54 2015 UTC,He's asking for 8 so he can get any were between 6-6.5 million. Just smart negotiation tactics if you ask me.

I was in a car accident last year that was the other driver's fault so I filed a diminishment of value claim with their insurance.  Everything I got basically said the accident dropped the value of my car 1500-2000, but I went in asking for 3000.  Of course they countered with something like 900 initially (much like the Caps lowball of 5.1), but we ended up on 1600.

caps,3dx0ao,grmuldoon,11,Mon Jul 20 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"3 things I loved seeing:  1) he has a knack for being in the right spot to get those dirty goals - how many of Ovi's assists already come off of big rebounds? throw a guy like Oshie in front and that can be even more common  2) able to score on the rush - how many times have we seen a 2-on-1 or 3-on-2 where one of Ovi's linemates gets set up beautifully because the D overcommits to #8 (understandably) but they're unable to finish? Oshie's certainly got the hands and the confidence to bury pucks on the rush  3) SHOOTOUT - yeah with the new 3v3 more games will end in OT, still... it never hurts to have a guy who is going up there as a coin flip (53%?! that's crazy! I knew he was good, but jesus!)  so in summation..."

This one I can get behind.   To McPhee's credit though, that second line center position was filled internally by a guy he drafted. It just took a long while."
caps,3dne2v,RiverboatGrambler,3,Sat Jul 18 12:35:39 2015 UTC,I'll float a name out: Mike Santrorelli. Solid two-way player. Could be a cheaper alternative to Fehr if he leaves.
caps,3dne2v,KeBron11,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"He isn't a great Faceoff guy and isn't totally solid defensively. Pretty high Corsi Against scores. Not sure how much of that is due to playing for Toronto, however. Better than nothing, but there are better realistic options available."
caps,3dne2v,Minnesota_MiracleMan,4,Fri Jul 17 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"Heck he doesn't even really take face offs. In 79 GP last season he only took 186 face offs and he only won 46.2% of them. To give some context for this, Fehr took 677 more face offs while winning 52% of them as our 3C."
caps,3dne2v,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"In free agency? Fehr's better when healthy, but that's always a gamble. Weiss has been awful the last two years. Roy's even smaller than Santa, not really an ideal guy for the third line.  Personally, I'd rather find a 3C through a trade (Johansson for Lars Eller, maybe), but Santorelli's not a bad option."
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,2,Sat Jul 18 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think Goc is a better option than Sanotrelli. Obviously Fehr is our beset option. Santorelli is better than nothing, but I wouldn't label him as a solid two way guy."
caps,3dne2v,Minnesota_MiracleMan,2,Sat Jul 18 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Goc had 9 points in 74 games last year. He's a great defensive specialist, but if he can't do anything at the other end of the ice he's not really an upgrade on Beagle.  It's too bad Horcoff already signed. A guy like him on the 1 year 1.75M contract he signed with the Ducks would've been perfect."
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,3,Sat Jul 18 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Do we not have all of the centers we need?  Backstrom, Kuzya, Beagle and Latta?  Or is Beagle 4C and Latta a scratch/4th line wing?"
caps,3dne2v,10lbs,5,Fri Jul 17 19:34:11 2015 UTC,But the issue might be with Backstrom missing some time at the beginning of the season.

caps,3dne2v,escher1,2,Fri Jul 17 23:33:26 2015 UTC,We saw a few flashes in the pan last season where he pulled out some wicked moves and plays but had no one to finish them off. Home 3rd line time would be really good for his development. I really hope he brings his A game to camp and earns it.   Chimmers-latta-Wilson would be one of the fastest yet hardest hitting 3rd lines in the league. So long as they all start scoring they make up a perfect 3rd line.
caps,3dne2v,Lightalife,3,Sat Jul 18 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"If they had time on the ice, they would score... our at least bang up the opposing team and the next line in would score  With latts chim and Wilson on... they could trickle in guys like oshie or ov or bura and have them clean up!!!!"
caps,3dne2v,escher1,3,Sat Jul 18 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"I think both Beagle and Latta are solid 4Cs and borderline 3Cs, so if we got a legitimate 3C, Beags would just move to right wing on the 4th line."

caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,4,Fri Jul 17 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think they're expecting Latta to turn into a reliable 4th line centre for them, at least. I've seen some people who think he might end up on the 3rd line."
caps,3dne2v,bullshitrocket,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:30:10 2015 UTC,I dunno. Why does a team that has a guy they see as a reliable 4th line center with 3rd line upside go and give a guy like Beagle (high energy faceoff and defensive specialist who at 29 has topped out as a 4th liner) 3 years at 1.75M per? I think Latta gets pushed out of the starting lineup when they add the last forward they've been talking about.
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,3,Sat Jul 18 05:18:27 2015 UTC,Latta will be in the line up. There is no reason to scratch a solid scrappy forward who can hold his own defensively.
caps,3dne2v,DustinPenncakes,0,Sat Jul 18 02:48:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's improved over the summer, but last year he just wasn't fast enough, and there's a reason they didn't trust him enough to give him PK time. I think there's a lot of wishful thinking about him because he was part of the Forsberg trade and his bromance with Wilson is adorable, but objectively he's really nothing special."
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,3,Sat Jul 18 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"He didn't get any PK time because we had a lot of other guys who played there instead (Ward, Chimera, Laich, Beagle, Brouwer, and Backstrom). Throw in Trotz love for veterans and that leaves next to no penalty killing for young guys like Latta. Going into next year we've lost two of those guys and only picked up one player who can PK in Oshie. In his time in Hershey he was one of their top PKers if I'm not mistaken and by no means is he a slow forward. He beats out any of the other depth signings (Galiev, Brown, Sill) for that final roster spot.  Edit: We also had Fehr who PK'd and we're more than likely not re-signing him, so we're down three of our Pkers from last season."
caps,3dne2v,DustinPenncakes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"We had seven guys get about a minute or more a night on the PK, if they'd wanted they could've given him time. I'm sure they would've liked to have someone take Backstrom's PK minutes. I admit I really don't follow the AHL, and yes Trotz does favor veterans, but I still think it's a bad sign that the guy got all of 5 minutes on the PK last year. They found time to experiment with sticking Burakovsky at center for the first time in his life, I can't believe they couldn't have found time to try Latta on the PK if they had any confidence that he could turn into a regular there.  Ideally, we add a good 3C and that forces Latta out of the lineup. Bottom six would be new 3C, one of Mojo/Bura, along with Wilson, Laich, Chimera, and Beagle. I'm not totally against Latta starting next year, but if it means we're going into the season without upgrading our 3rd line I'll be disappointed."
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:03:44 2015 UTC,What about Burakovsky? Can't he play C?
caps,3dne2v,qenia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define 'can'. In a pinch, sure. But he'd never done it before last year, doesn't do it particularly well, and if Kuz is the 2C we've got two second-year, converted wingers playing center. I'm of the opinion that if you're going with a 2C that's young and/or not great defensively, you should really have a 3C (and a third line in general) that can take a lot of defensive assignments. If not, you're stuck playing your 4th line way more than you should and putting your 1st line out in bad situations while you shelter your middle six. Our 4th line is not anything special, and it's wasting your stars to put Ovie and Backstrom out for a lot of defensive zone faceoffs."
caps,3dne2v,Windupferrari,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"You Beagle is up to play 3C?  A 3C should at least get between 25 and 30 points, ideally mostly on even strength. Beagle just had a career year and got 20. Sure, he might have gotten more if he played the full 80 games, but keep in mind that in the games he played he spent quite some time riding shotgun with Backstrom and Ovie."

He asks the most awkward, inappropriate, questions of players, or simply repeats questions already asked, OR questions anyone following the team just a little already knows the answer to.

caps,3dknq6,PeteWithTwoLegs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:53 2015 UTC,Don't think we'll make it this year but my wife and I have taken the train from Austin to Dallas for a couple of games and it's been really really fun even though they've always lost. Because Stars.
caps,3dknq6,PeteWithTwoLegs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm in San Antonio, but I have too many real life commitments to do a Caps trip to Dallas.  I have to be content with Center Ice or FSSW.  Hope you can make it happen, though."
caps,3djadz,MrNillows,9,Thu Jul 16 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"I hope this is mostly a Hershey addition. I don't have anything against the guy personally, but we have a lot more promising players I'd like to see given opportunities."
caps,3djadz,gerpsohappy,9,Thu Jul 16 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"Expectation is, depending on whether the Caps add another F, for Sill to compete for a depth spot at camp. Most likely Hershey-bound though."

caps,3djadz,gerpsohappy,3,Thu Jul 16 19:00:36 2015 UTC,Wilson kicked this guys ass last year.
