RedditWritesSeinfeld,3dmyjj,StaySteezyLarteezy,2,Fri Jul 17 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"Several hours pass. A car is parked a little ways down from the entrance of Jerry and Kramer's building, which is not unusual, as the street is full of parked cars. This parked car, however, holds a short, stocky, balding man, in a plaid shirt, who is donning a balaclava.  From the windshield of the car, the masked man can see Kramer and Stacey walking hand-in-hand down the sidewalk, practically skipping. It's clear that they are having a great time getting to know one another. The camera remains close enough to discern that they are talking with one another, but far enough away so that nothing can be heard from their conversation. However, their smiles and giggles are obvious.  The love birds briefly pause at the apartment entrance, as Kramer clumsily fumbles in his pockets for a set of keys. Suddenly, quick footsteps are heard, followed by a sickening ""Thud,"" and Kramer falls to the ground without uttering a word. Blood begins to pool on the concrete beneath his head.   ""That's peculiar!"" says a mocking voice, muffled by fabric. Stacey screams into the suffocating abyss that is the night's air, as the masked man runs away.  It's the next day. Elaine is sitting on her couch with Putty, who is himself staring off into space. The phone rings and Elaine answers. She is clearly distraught by the news being conveyed to her. She begins shaking and crying, dropping the phone.  ""Looks like an Arby's night,"" says Putty, unphased. Tht lack of Putty's interest in Elaine's emotions further compounds her grief over the news of Kramer's injuries. Elaine runs into the bathroom and locks the door.   ""Guess I won't be spongeworthy for quite a while,"" he says.  A week later, maintenance is called to Elaine's apartment because of a strong odor. They find two decaying corpses, one in the bathroom and one on the couch. The former died of a sleeping pill overdose, the latter of dehydration. By this time, Kramer has also died, as he succumbed to a hemorrhage sustained during his brutal nighttime assault. The suspect is still at large.  A few weeks later, George and Jerry are eating in the diner. George has little-to-no appetite, and keeps looking over his shoulders during their meal. Jerry is visibly distraught, as he has just learned of both Kramer's and Elaine's deaths.  ""I didn't even get to attend their funerals! Serenity now!"" says Jerry, throwing his arms into the air.  ""We talked about this,"" says George. ""People try to call you. You keep saying 'Uncle Leo?' like a smartass. Sure, it's funny to people who know you. But to those who don't -- like the funeral home directors and your friends' relatives -- they just believe they've called a wrong number, and they hang up. This is why you're so far out of the loop.""   ""Uncle Leo?"" says Jerry, sarcastically.  ""See, that's exactly what I mean,"" says George. ""It's like you have a tic or something."""

RedditWritesSeinfeld,3dm0sq,pretzelzetzel,38,Fri Jul 17 10:37:07 2015 UTC,"Kramer's Subplot: In his scheme to become a TV weatherman, Kramer inadvertently recruits and mentors impressionable Neo-Nazis.  After tracing his IP address, Stormfront members begin showing up at Kramer's apartment. Under the impression that Kramer is training them for war, they agree to help Kramer install weather monitoring devices on the apartment's roof. He coaches them (incorrectly and clumsily) to read rain gauges and thermometers... which they perceive as genius-level metaphors for guerrilla tactics and strategy. At first, his Neo-Nazi friends are gruff and intimidating, which Kramer (erroneously) attributes to their experience as grizzled storm chasers. As the episode progresses, they clearly begin to view Kramer as a father-like mentor.  Kramer's big break arrives. While on the subway, Kramer's lackeys heckle and intimidate Al Roker on the basis of his ethnicity, until Kramer informs them that Roker is a talented meteorologist. His lackeys are obviously confused by Kramer's defense of Roker, but back-off in deference. To Roker, the intimidation and the sudden intervention come-off as a racketeering ploy, so he ""bribes"" Kramer by revealing an audition for a part-time TV weatherman at a local station. Kramer misinterprets this as recognition of his meteorological prowess.  The Stormfront members realize that Kramer is genuinely interested in meteorology, so they decide to utilize the audition to their advantage. Backstage, right before his audition, Kramer's Stormfront protegees present him with a ""token"" of their appreciation: a t-shirt, emblazoned with a Swastika at the chest. He nervously dons the shirt as his protegees stand around him aggressively. After the stage manager shoos the Neo-Nazis out of the dressing area, Kramer manages to find a Tweed jacket to cover the shirt.   George's Subplot: After joining what he believes is a support group for the balding, George makes plans to seduce who he believes to be a cancer patient.  Outside of Jerry and Kramer's building, George gets into a confrontation with a Rabbi over a parking spot. The skin-headed Neo-Nazis, on their way to Kramer's apartment, step-in to defend George, disparaging the Rabbi's long hair and beard. George, thinking they were insulting the Rabbi on the basis of his hair, accepts an invitation to one of their meetings, thinking it's a hair-loss support group.  During the meeting, the language used to refer to other ethnicities is ambiguous, giving George the impression that they are discussing strife between balding and full-haired men. He hits it off with a bald, pale, frail, yet beautiful woman at the meeting, who gives him her number as she leaves for an appointment at the hospital. Thinking she is in chemotherapy, he hatches a plan to nurse her back to health as a caring friend, thinking it will pay dividends once she recovers and regrows her hair.   Jerry and Elaine's Subplots: J. Peterman's negligence gets Jerry out of a romantic jam, but puts Elaine into a professional one.  Jerry's association with Kramer and his new-found friends gives Jerry's girlfriend the suspicion that Jerry is secretly racist. After they break-up, Jerry grows uncharacteristically withdrawn and depressed. In an effort to get Jerry to open-up, Elaine invites him to have lunch at her office.   Peterman overhears Jerry's laments. In his usual melodramatic flair, Peterman chastises Jerry for giving up on love, and for letting his soulmate slip through his fingers without a fight. Peterman then insists on helping Jerry recover his true love. Elaine reminds Peterman that he has several important high-end business negotiations scheduled for the afternoon. Peterman instructs Elaine to attend the meetings in his stead, dismissive of her concerns that she is unqualified to do so.   Some time passes. Peterman instructs Jerry to dial his ex-girlfriend over speakerphone. As Jerry begins pleading with her to reconsider her decision, Peterman quietly hands Jerry sappily-written responses. Knowing Peterman, and seeing Jerry cringe as he reviews the notes, the audience knows that they contain embarrassingly romantic prose. Jerry shakes his head, then reluctantly begins reading what's scribbled on the notes being handed to him. Surprisingly, Jerry's ex responds positively to Peterman's schmaltzy prose, despite Jerry's unenthusiastic reading. She agrees to give Jerry another chance, chalking everything up to a series of misunderstandings. A frazzled-looking Elaine enters Peterman's office as Jerry hangs up the phone. From her body language, it is clear that the negotiations went poorly.   After Jerry leaves, Peterman asks Elaine about the meetings, but is obviously distracted and wistful, having successfully played Cupid for Jerry. Elaine explains that the terms for Peterman's company are extremely unfavorable, which he mishears as unfavorable for the other companies. Peterman begins commending Elaine for ""sending those dogs whimpering back to their mothers."" The more Elaine attempts to reiterate the dire situation, the more Peterman accuses her of lacking confidence in what he sees as a clear talent for negotiation. To bolster her spirits, he promotes her into a position that is beyond her skill level and expertise.   Episode Climax: A gift triggers race riots. Two relationships dissolve in the midst of chaos. Elaine folds under the stress of her job.  Kramer's audition devolves into an unmitigated disaster. Still nervous from the encounter with his aggressive protegees, he fumbles his words when reading from the cue-cards, sweat soaking through his tweed jacket. As he motions his hands and arms over a radar image, his hand punches through the green screen fabric. His jacket, caught by the tear in the green screen, rips-apart as he pulls-out his hand, revealing his Swastika-emblazoned shirt. Unbeknownst to those in the studio, Kramer's lackeys turned on the live camera feed: the Swastika reveal had been broadcast to the whole of New York City. Kramer then comically slips in a puddle of his own sweat.  Meanwhile, the Neo-Nazis are holding a protest rally outside of a local health clinic. George thinks the rally is due to his love interest getting kicked-out of the clinic, on the basis of her baldness. The ""offending"" doctor, a black man, emerges and attempts to calm the crowd, obviously confused regarding the purpose of the protest. When George notices that the doctor is himself bald, and when his girlfriend begins spewing hateful diatribes, he begins piecing things together. The doctor recognizes George's girlfriend, saying, ""Didn't I just kick you out of here for stealing pills from the pharmacy?"" George realizes that the ""hospital appointment"" she mentioned at the meeting was actually a euphemism for robbery, and that the rally is retribution for a black man embarrassing his Neo-Nazi girlfriend. After the broadcast of Kramer's audition, the protest explodes into a full-fledged riot.  Jerry and his girlfriend happen to be walking through Manhattan, holding hands, clearly enjoying their date. They discuss plans to have dinner with George and his girlfriend later in the evening, Jerry's girlfriend remarking that George has such a kind heart to see-through her illness. They shake their heads when they happen across the riot, Jerry saying, ""I can't believe these kinds of people exist. I hope they get what's coming to them."" Suddenly, George emerges from the rabble of Neo-Nazis and police, running, only to be tackled and handcuffed right in front of Jerry and his girlfriend. As he's lifted to his feet by two police officers, George sees Jerry standing right in front of him.   ""Jerry!?"" says George.   ""Uncle Leo?"" says Jerry, sarcastically.   Jerry and his girlfriend watch as George is carried towards a paddy wagon. As the doors swing open, we see Kramer and his lackeys cuffed and sitting, with hang-dog expressions, Kramer's Swastika shirt clearly showing.   ""Jerry!? says Kramer, as the doors shut. One of the officers looks scornfully at Jerry and says, ""These friends of yours?""   ""Have a nice life, Jerry"" says Jerry's girlfriend, as she storms away.   The camera then cuts to a desk in a large, poorly-lit office. Elaine is passed-out at in her chair, presumably exhausted from the demands of her new position. In the background, a TV reporter describes that New York has entered into a state of emergency, as large-scale rioting plagues Manhattan. The camera slowly moves to reveal a bottle of whiskey and an empty medicine vial. Sleeping pills are scattered across stock charts, which show a substantial drop-off in the trading price of Peterman's company. The camera halts at Elaine's hand, which relaxed into a partially-open fist as the sleeping pills took her life. The credits roll, the bass riff signaling the end of an episode is uncharacteristically absent.  Legacy  The jarring final shot in this episode was uncharacteristic of the Seinfeld series. Ratings began to plummet when it was learned that producers of the show killed-off Julia Louis-Dreyfuss' character after an intense round of salary negotiations, despite approving increases for all her male co-stars. In a display of solidarity, Jerry, Jason, and Michael left the show. The producers hastily recast the characters, which led to Larry David's resignation as showrunner.   Purged of its central talent, Seinfeld floundered for one more season, punctuated by a disastrous final episode. In the two-hour-long series finale event, Jerry asked for Elaine's hand in marriage (she had inexplicably revived from her suicide). As a result, George and Kramer had existential crises. George sought-out therapy for his many plot-driving neuroses. Kramer settled-down with the daughter of a preacher, taking a job as an OSHA inspector to make ends' meat. Enraged fans widely consider this final disastrous season to lie outside of the series' cannon."

Jerry: (brings over Clemente)  George: What kinda clip joint are you running here!  Owner: Hey!  George: We work and slave all day at the Yankees front office and then you expect us to come down here and do your jobs, well no, sir! No, sir!  Owner: You know what, you no like it. You go!

Kramer: You can't ban us... the papaya here is delectable.  Owner: He can and he will, because Yerry Seinfelt has proved that he isn't a no show... he is a show show!  Jerry: So you'll call off the restaurant guys?  Owner: (nods)  (Cut to scene inside monks Jerry and Elaine in a booth at monks.)  Jerry: (eating happily) Oh, I never thought I'd miss tuna on rye so much. You know they cut off the crusts here.  Elaine: You are a child.  Jerry: Speaking of child, how is the bun in the oven coming?  Elaine: Ugh. Everything's back to normal... except one thing.  (Elaine gets up and puts on her fanny pack again. Then stretches out her hand admiring the impressive stone.)  Jerry: You still haven't told Puddy?  Elaine: I just need... like three more days with the ring.  George: (muffled) What's that...she's still got the ring?  (turn to see George standing facing the window opposite the booth, holding a coffee from starbucks in his hand.)  Jerry: (shouting to George) Just apologize and come inside!  George: NO! NO! Jerry, They're wrong! I'm right!

Dr. Jacobs: You fool, don't you see. This game is viral, it absorbs every game it touches. If we unleashed kramer-opoly on the world. It would consume all games! Then who would buy Sorry and it's pop-o-matic bubble! No, young man, we must destroy it. And never again speak of the name Kramer-opoly again!  (See the kramer-opoly thrown into a raging fire.)

George: Fine you can use my account but you've got pay, I'm not picking up your tab.  Jerry proceeds to mess around on his phone canceling his current ride.

Driver: Look I didn't get into this business to make friends, you can keep talking, but I ain't gonna respond.  The rest of the episode would involve Jerry requesting his Uber home and having Antonio show up, then Antonio drives him home questioning how he got to where he was going.

(Kramer falls backwards) I nailed one of the protesters in the face with the sign.   Jerry- (Has a look of astonishment on his face) Were they okay?  Kramer- (Gets back to his feet) No Jerry! I mean I whacked that poor girl in the face, and her nose starts bleeding everywhere! Like a geyser!  Jerry- Like a geyser?!  Kramer- A geyser Jerry. (Mimics a geyser coming out of his nose)  Jerry- So what happened to your date?  Kramer- Well..... She thinks I'm the worst person in the world. You know those feminists Jerry, they're really sensitive.  (Jerry stands there astonished, the buzzer rings)  Jerry- Yeah?  Muffled voice- It's me.  Jerry- Elaine?  Elaine- Yeah, let me up!  (Jerry buzzes her up)  Jerry- (Turns to Kramer, smugly says) So are you going to see her again?  Kramer- (Blows air out of his pushy cheeks, shrugs his shoulders)  (Elaine enters the apartment, her face is covered in bandages, and it looks like she has two black eyes)  Jerry- What happened to you?  (Kramer eyes light up, he realizes that he hit Elaine last night. Kramer makes a run for the exit)  Elaine- What's his problem?  Jerry- (Slight smile on his face) Women. What happened to you?  Elaine- Well I was down at that Italian restaurant last night, protesting their ridiculous desert.  Jerry- (Just realizes why Kramer ran out the door) You don't say.  Elaine- Yeah, I got assaulted Jerry. Some bumbling bafoon hit me in the face with a sign.   (Suddenly you here Kramer stumbling out of his apartment, dropping his keys)  Elaine-Wait a minute, bumbling bafoon? (Elaine runs out the door) Kramer!! Get back here! Where were you last night?  Jerry- I really need to rearrange my priorities. (Grabs his jacket and keys, and walks out of the apartment)  Outside on the street we see George furiously looking through his phone looing at Humans of New York picctures  George- Where are you? I know your out there somewhere taking pictures.  (Suddenly Kramer runs on by, followed not far by Elaine)  Elaine- Kramer! Get back here!  (Jerry walks up behind George)  Jerry- How's the hunt coming?  George- Oh I'll find him, he's out there somewhere. I feel like I'm one step behind him. (George yells and raises his hands) Yes! He's on Broadway right now, he just posted a picture. Jerry can I get a ride?  Jerry- Sure.  (They walk over to Jerry's car. The car is strewn with parking tickets, and has a parking boot on it)  Jerry- What!? How did this happen? (Clenches his fist) Kramer!   George- What?  Jerry- Kramer date is getting revenge on him for the horrible night, she must think that this is his car. Great!   George- But how?   Jerry- She's a cop.  George- Well I've gotta go, I can't miss this guy. (Throws his hand up in the air) Taxi!  (Elaine has lost site of Kramer while chasing him down, she stops running and bends over trying to catch her breath. Suddenly we see the back of a person who's holding a camera)  Camera man- Wow this story should be great. Can I get your picture for my web site?  Elaine- (Looks like she's going to kill the guy) What do you think?  Credits"

Edit: The unfortunate part about how I ended the episode is that we don't get to see George backtrack as he does so  famously. Oh well.
RedditWritesSeinfeld,3coys3,sprandel,2,Fri Jul 10 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"Opening Scene. George and Elaine are sitting down at Monk's waiting for Jerry, who was running late.  Jerry enters in the diner while in the middle of a phone call  Jerry:... I just think that enough is enough. Every relationship needs to have some give and some take. A two way street! It feels like I'm always giving, and giving more and more but I don't get back what I put in. It's a frustrating position to be in for a person. Anyway, I'll let you know if I do end up cutting the cord. Talk to you later. Yeah, love you too, Mom.  George: What's that about?  Jerry: Oh, you know, sometimes things just go on too long and you have to get out of a relationship if it just isn't working out for you.   Elaine: You know what, Jerry. I completely agree. I have a date with Nick tomorrow night and I think I'm going to end it.   Jerry: What? So soon? What made you decide that?  Elaine: It's just like you said, Jerry. Sometimes it's just time to... cut the cord, like you said.   Jerry: Well, alright, if that's what you think you need to do, do it!  Elaine: Actually, I think I'm going to go see him right now, this has gone on long enough! Talk to you guys later.  George: See ya.  Jerry: Later, Elaine.  George: I think I know what you're talking about too, Jerry. Maybe I'll join you in this one. I've been feeling kind of the same way, and I think we should go in on this one together to avoid any weird situations around it in the future, you know?  Jerry: Sure, but what about all the Mets games you get to see?  George: Oh, so what, I can find my own tickets and get out to some ballgames!  Jerry: Alright, so it's settled. We're in this one together. I'll let you know how it goes for me and we'll be able to move on from this one together.  Cuts to Nick's Apartment  Elaine: So I really think it's time we talk about something that's been weighing on me...  Nick: Oh? What's that?  Elaine: You know... I'm tired of being the only one in this relationship that seems to be putting any effort towards it.   Nick: What are you talking about? Where did this come from?  Elaine: Well, I had a sit down with a friend today who feels the same way about his relationship with his girlfriend and it really hit home for me.  Nick: Oh, is that Jerry? You guys dated like 20 years ago, now you're both going to cut off your relationships... are you... getting back together?  Elaine: Jerry? Oh, no. No, way.   Nick: Whatever Elaine. If you don't want to be with me and you want to go date Jerry, or whoever you want, whatever. Have fun, don't come crawling back to me though.  Elaine: Niiick.  Nick: Oh don't ""Niiick"" me. You're the one that came in here to break up with me!  Elaine: I'm sorry Nick. I better go.  Nick: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.  Back at George's Parents' house, George is on the phone  George: Yeah, so anyway, I think it would be best if we just... didn't hang out anymore. I don't want it to be weird for us to hang out and to leave him out of it. I don't think Jerry's a jealous man, but you never know.  Silence as George listens to the other end of the phone call  George: I mean, ultimately, it's not really you... It's me. I need to be nurtured in a relationship, nurtured! I just don't think I can get that with you anymore and that's why I have to cut if off. It feels like I'm putting in all the work and you're never there to be found when I need you.  Silence as George listens to the other end of the phone call  George: Yes, I'm sure. Look, I've gotta go. Talk to yo-- actually, no, I won't. That was the whole point of this call, huh? Anyway, take care of yourself.  Back at Monk's, Kramer walks up to the register to pay for his coffee he had before the gang showed up and overhears some conversation  George: So, that's it Jerry, I did it. I broke it off. Cut the cord. Pulled the plug.  Jerry: Great! How did it go?  George: It was rough, lots of crying, pleading, begging, but in the end I think it was completely worth it. I feel free. Like a new man!  Jerry: Well that's great! I'm glad to hear it, George. Elaine, how'd your talk with Nick go?  Elaine: Well, not as well as it could have gone. I went over to break up with him and he ends up kicking me out. Can you believe that Jerry? He completely turned the tables on me!  Jerry: Well I know after I'm finished I ask the woman to leave too, so I'm not surprised.  Elaine gives Jerry a disapproving look. Jerry asks for the check  Jerry: Alright guys, gotta go. Talk to you later, let's all hang out tonight huh?  George: Sure, sounds good. See you around.  Elaine: Yeah..."

Newman's going back there tonight, and I need to make sure I do better. She said she'd go out with the first one of us who would win her the grand prize.  Elaine: Winning the grand prize is impossible. Jerry's right. She's just using you for your money.  -- Kramer dismisses them, heading for the door --  Jerry: Before you go, answer me this. Did you go on the haunted house ride yesterday?  Kramer: Nooo way. Those things give me the creeps.   Jerry: Tell me, what would you think of someone who wasn't scared of it at all?  -- Kramer goes on some long tirade about how that person must be some lunatic, who cannot be trusted --  Jerry: Uhh, thanks.  -- Kramer exits, as Jerry turns to Elaine with a 'I told you so' look --  Jerry: See Elaine, even Kramer agrees.

RedditWritesSeinfeld,3cbls3,IveAlreadyWon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:09:58 2015 UTC,Character setting: That guy Elaine's dating is cocky about his cooking but his dish tastes like cock.  Edit: added some words.
RedditWritesSeinfeld,3cbls3,notquitter,18,Fri Jul 10 11:13:22 2015 UTC,George's picture actually did become a meme.

Kramer: ""Well, yeah, but that was four hours ago, Jerry, I NEED to make another stop!""  Jerry: ""Just ride the bus, who even gave you a driver's license?""  George: ""What is this? Look at this new internet thing Jerry and  tell me who this looks like!""  Jerry: ""Huh, it looks like...you!""  George: ""IT IS ME!""  Kramer: ""So how bout it, Jerry?""  Jerry: ""Ah, take it! Just take it! But I want it back by 6, I'm  going over to Annette's house tonight for dinner.""  Kramer: ""Tchk, you got it.""  George: ""I can't believe it! I'm all over this site!""  Jerry: ""What site is that?""  George: ""It's one of those meme sites! There are hundreds of  pictures of me on here Jerry, all with insulting captions!""  Jerry: ""Well maybe this is a good thing! I mean you get some  publicity, people start to recognize you. You could really start to  see what being a D-List celebrity is like.""  George: rolls eyes and scoffs  Jerry: ""Speaking of which, Elaine was watching one of those  cooking shows yesterday and you'll never guess who she saw on  it.""  George: ""I don't suppose it's this Ellen Pao woman that's also on  this meme site. You know what this means, Jerry? It means I am  now on the same level as Ellen Pao.""  Jerry: ""She says she saw Annette.""  George: ""What your girlfriend?""  Jerry: ""Exactly. And not only that, but she was eliminated from  the show first round.""  George: ""So?""  Jerry: ""So I don't know if I can go out with a first round  elimination, George. I mean you figure you aren't the best chef  in the world you still make it past the first few weeks, but she  was out. Done. Seeya. First!""  George: ""Great, maybe SHE can get a little 'y u no' over HER  face. Why is it always me, Jerry? Why is it always me.""  Jerry: ""And I'm going over to her place tonight! For dinner! Who  knows what kind of concoction she came up with. First one  out.."""

RedditWritesSeinfeld,3cbls3,i_downvotecats,7,Tue Jul 7 11:22:59 2015 UTC,Jerry has to play act how much he loves the food because she feels she's the best cook around and isn't exactly restrained about it.  G: Why do you do it?  J: The sex.
RedditWritesSeinfeld,3cbls3,GeorgeAmberson,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:18 2015 UTC,The girlfriend would casually mention she's a Masterchef. This impresses Jerry enough to insist she cook him dinner. Only later would Jerry find out she was first to be eliminated.

(George produces a crumbled coupon out of his massive wallet.)  Jerry, squinting, reading the coupon: Buy one get one free chicken vindaloo?  George: That's right.  Jerry: You'd fly across the Atlantic for a free meal?  George: It's not the cost, it's the principle of the thing.  Jerry: The principle being...  George: I've earned it!  For too long society has withheld the fruits of my labor, Jerry.  <Starts marching towards the bathroom>  <Kramer bursts in>  Jerry (yelling after George): Chicken vindaloo is not a fruit!"
