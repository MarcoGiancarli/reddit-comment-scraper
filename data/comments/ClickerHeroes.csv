This is very wrong. Just because you can reach your gilded Hero insta-killing, doesn't mean that particular Hero is the most efficient Hero to be gilded.  I can insta-kill with Phthalo to level 2000 with only 1 gild on her, which theoretically means I can insta-kill with Lilin to level 1000 with only 1 gild on her. That doesn't transition into Alabaster being optimal for me."

ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,KingJoshu,17,Tue Jul 21 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"My thought on this would be to remove the cap on Khrysos, but have it level up like Iris. That is, Khrysos gives gold equivalent to a clickable on the zone matching Khrysos' level."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,Chassama,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:43 2015 UTC,"Totally, i hate how your flair is the highest hero you can buy with the pole start money  Or at least introduce a ""go to zone X"" search function that allows you to jump directly to that instead of clicking several hundred times."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,silver_nuke13,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"""Go to zone x"" would reduce the pain of no-clickable start by a lot."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,j_rodman,11,Tue Jul 21 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"You don't have to wait 30min for a clickable. Just use the midas start:   If you forgot to save a clickable what you do is something called the Midas Start. Turn off progression mode and kill on lower zones until have enough gold to buy 100 levels in Midas which unlocks golden clicks. Activate golden clicks and turn on progression mode (i.e go to your highest zone) and click away. You will get a bunch of gold and you're on your way again.   (Copied from another comment I made a while ago)  But, yes I agree. Something needs to be done about Khrysos. Some people have suggested it be affected by gold ancients which would be nice since you could at least buy 100 Midas. This suggestion is pretty good though."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,SuperSmurfen,7,Tue Jul 21 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"I never heard about that strategy. If I ever ascend without a clickable on accident I just level what I can, exit the game, and come back later. That's way better. Thanks!"
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,ElCattivo,7,Tue Jul 21 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"With Khrysos you dont even have to click yourself to kill stuff. Scroll to a zone in the 60s, buy your highest hero (either Alexa or Natalia) and let her kill a few monsters, while you buy lvl 25 Cid, collect the gold, buy Midas 100, click the buy all upgrades button, press A, 1, 5 and done.  Only costs a few seconds."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,TheWhiteAvatar,4,Tue Jul 21 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"Nice idea, but it should be with much lower percentage, because it would be no point in leveling Khrysos up if it gives the same amount of gold as a clickable on its first level. It's quite enough for any Iris level to start instakilling.  Would be better if it had, let's say 200 levels with a quickly enough growing amount of HS needed for each new level.  And on level 1 it would be 1% of the gold gain from a clickable on a highest unlocked level at the start of a new run. With each new level it will grow by +1%, at max possible to make it 200% of the clickable gold (or some other maximum number) but it would take a lot of HS, so people would have to think if they want to deal with Midas start and waiting for clickables but save HS for Solomon and other ancients, or to just go and make things easier by spending a good amount of HS on it.   We should remember not only about making game process easier for us for as little investement possible, but also about how the gameplay would be like and reasons for buying or leveling anceints to certain levels. :)"
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,Siibeeyy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:41 2015 UTC,"As soon as it roughly gives the same amount as a clickable you know you have clear start though, going up to 200% of clickable gold or any higher is really unnecessary considering the gold from a regular clickable is enough to start instakilling at that level and the next 15 at least"
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,TheWhiteAvatar,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. But going past clickable starting gold is nice, too and again (just like avoiding Midas start) it's mostly for conveniece purposes if a player would wish to spend their HS on additional levels.   Example: my Iris was 850 with stopping instakilling at 1850, so it was all optimal, but even though I could start instakilling with one clickable I couldn't buy my main gilded hero right away and had to wait for some time of gathering gold by instakilling with other rangers.   So, it still would make sense for late game players to get more starting gold than just from one clickable by leveling Khrysos, to be able to start with your main gilded hero XD"
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,shoopi12,3,Tue Jul 21 14:07:03 2015 UTC,There have been a couple of good suggestions on how to buff Khrysos to make it more useful as a convenience ancient. I really think one of them should be implemented.
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,pavook,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, when i got Khrysos, he was useful like 5 Ascends, then after clickable + Iris kicks in his gold become useless unfortunately. I would be perfectly happy even If he gives just about 0,9x clickable gold on max level. It would be so much more than now."
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,frankje,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"My suggestion was to rebalance Khrysos to +10% gold of highest unlocked zone, with 10 levels (+10% each level), and an exponential cost of 4n or n6 or something. I don't like the idea of Khrysos giving more than a clickable like OP's suggestion, it should be equal reward at cap at best.  Also this way we would get a free respec as well so I can get rid of Thusia and prepare for deep runs again!"
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,j_rodman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:45 2015 UTC,Does highest unlocked zone mean the same zone that the clickable uses?  Like the zone that the progression boot icon would choose?
ClickerHeroes,3e2gvd,frankje,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:18 2015 UTC,Yes.
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,jp2gmd2137,5,Tue Jul 21 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"You can if you want, but I personally wouldn't recommend it until you have an optimal zone of >1800. It's still expensive to start levelling both idle and active ancients that early, especially if you plan on getting all the skill extensive ancients plus Pluto/Thusia.  It depends on how active you want to go. Wanna push an extra 30-40 zones when you've reached your optimal idle zone? A few 100 levels in Frags/Bhaal and 30-40 in Juggs should suffice. Wanna do some decent pushing for a few hundred zones? Wait until later when you can pick up all relevant ancients.  On a side note, progress does start to feel slow at this stage, and it will only be getting worse."
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,frankje,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a definite consensus on when to go hybrid but I see most people recommend around when you regild to Banana (2k Siya). For you it's probably a bit early.  As for your build, your gold are a bit underleveled. Bring them to 815. Most importantly though, you have a lot of unspent HS, which is probably a big reason behind your lack of progress. With Morg you shouldn't have any at all. Spend it all on upgrading ancients according to the formulas in this thread."
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:52 2015 UTC,I have so many unspent bcoz I wasnt sure if I should go hybrid or no
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,SuperSmurfen,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:46 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said it's most likely too early to be efficient. Spend it all on your ancients. You'll see big progress from that."
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,Zamuzz,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"I personally went for a hybrid build when my optimal zone was 2050. I've seen a lot of guys saying that when your optimal zone is 1800 you could go hybrid but not before that due to the fact that you don't generate enough HS per run to level both idle and active ancients at the same time. However, it's your game. You can play it like you want :)"
ClickerHeroes,3e40s7,m1j5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:11 2015 UTC,technically active builds are almost never more optimal but it does add a bit of fun to the game when it gets a little too grindy
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,Hershman,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"Alright, so let's do a comparison:  8-3-7 multiplies your click damage by 3 * 18 = 54  8-7-3 multiplies your click damage by 5 * (0.41 + 0.59 * 18) = 55.15  Now that's without bhaal. Now let's do a very simple equation to find out at what level of bhaal they break even they break even.  3 * 18 * (1 + 0.15 * a) = 5 * (0.41 + 0.59 * 18 * (1 + 0.15 * a))  54 + 8.1 * a = 55.15 + 7.965 * a  0.135 * a = 1.15  a = 8.52  So (if my math is correct) if you have a level 9 bhaal or more, it's better to use 8-3 and if you have a level 8 bhaal or less, it's better to use 8-7.  Since in your case Bhaal is 2350, 8-3 should do more damage.  EDIT: That's an average.  EDIT 2: It's also written in the FAQ"
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,The_Chosen_Kappa,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly what the wiki says, but since this thread is about a complete skillcombo, you would have to account for dmg-multipliers like superclicks, energized superclicks and eventually powersurge.  At least under the assumption that click damage modifies crit damage."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Taking other skills in account won't change anything, except making it more complicated. And yes, super clicks affects crit damage afaik."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,The_Chosen_Kappa,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"Of course it makes a difference if you have 59% crit with 400% crit dmg (3-8-7 combo) or 100% crit with 200% crit dmg (8-3-7 combo). Those numbers are most likely  wrong, but close enough to show what i mean."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:41 2015 UTC,That's... exactly what I did
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,The_Chosen_Kappa,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Well, i guess its because its not actually a 2:4 ratio but 3:5 ratio with energized superclicks, which is why 41% more crits trumps 40% more dmg."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,5,Tue Jul 21 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"Energizing Lucky Strikes increases your crit chance from 59% (with regular lucky stikes) to 100%. That's a ~69% dps increase, assuming your regular clicks do basically no dmg.  Energizing Super clicks increases the bonus from 200% to 400%. Meaning you go from 300% click damage to 500% which is a 66% dmg increase.  69 > 66  Q.E.D"
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,SuperSmurfen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on your amount of clicks, going from 59% to 100% may be useful if you click yourself, but not if you use an autoclicker who generates 30-40 clicks per second."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"How do you figure? Why would clicks/second affect the efficacy of crit chance? If you're 1 shotting mobs with 1 crit then maybe, but OP and the FAQ is talking about using skills to kill a boss."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:42 2015 UTC,"Actually I should have clarified this is for the tale end of a deep run, so I'm definitely not 1 shotting the mobs.  I'm using an autoclicker that does about 30 clicks per second. I assumed the amount of clicks doesnt matter, but perhaps it does?"
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,SuperSmurfen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:53 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't. Not for any reason I can think of anyway. I don't know why /u/ElCattivo thinks so."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"Of course it does or can you tell the difference if a mob dies from the first or second click from 30/second? Like that you can still use your energize for something else, like the next boss."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,0,Tue Jul 21 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"I dont think he was talking only about bosses, either way your answer seems to be too generalized. Btw shouldnt your formula also consider higher crits with activated lucky strikes and energized super clicks?"
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:11 2015 UTC,He just said he was and what do you mean?
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"End of a deep run doesnt means he is using 30 seconds per boss. oO And if it where like that, he would use all his skills, including super clicks, lucky strikes and energize, in whatever combination. But you neglected skill synergies completely."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,ElCattivo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters whether it's a boss or not, I'm just curious about what does the most damage during the duration of the combo."
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,WowZipZipBoomBoomWow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:34 2015 UTC,Then someone would need to calculate the difference between 59% crits with 500% extradmg (taken from smurfens post) which affects normal hits and crits and 100% crits with 200% extradmg (obviously only affecting crits).  Not quite sure if you can ignore Powersurge in such a comparison but i actually dont think so.
ClickerHeroes,3e3b97,Calicee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:12 2015 UTC,What level do you have Bhaal at?  (What is your critical click multiplier?)
ClickerHeroes,3e2wct,OPs_Spare_Account,9,Tue Jul 21 15:23:43 2015 UTC,It's not based of your HZE. It's based on your highest unlocked zone at that ascension. A clickable will give 10 regular mobs worth of gold from your highest unlocked zone. This means if you click it after you ascend it will be based off your Iris starting zone.
ClickerHeroes,3e2wct,SuperSmurfen,3,Tue Jul 21 15:25:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes more sense. So people doing this are having a significantly leveled iris. I haven't summoned iris yet, so I probably have a way to go before this is especially useful. Thanks for the information."
ClickerHeroes,3e2wct,SuperSmurfen,6,Tue Jul 21 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"No problem. And yes, this only starts to become important when you have an Iris over I'd say ~60-70."
ClickerHeroes,3e2wct,j_rodman,3,Tue Jul 21 15:30:13 2015 UTC,"Basically, while extra gold this way would be nice without Iris, it's not essential.  You can just level up heroes you can afford and the instant killing should commence. Lots of gold wouldn't change that drastically (though perhaps it would let you ignore the game longer.)  With high level Iris, it's the difference between being able to start from your Iris level promptly, or having to manually select zones 20, then 60, then 120 etc before you can re-enable the auto-advance feature."
ClickerHeroes,3e2v1n,Schiffy94,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"I still dont see why someone would use this.

ClickerHeroes,3e2v1n,erichwanh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"Kind of off-topic, but someone asked..  FWIW, this goes back to the history of 8-bit character encodings and shift-jis.  Before the world of unicode and multibyte characters, shift-jis squeezed as much of japanese as possible into a single byte encoding that also included an odd multi-byte extension.  In short they ran out of room for the backslash.  Shift-jis remains in use, even now, for a variety of reasons including legacy baggage and Japanese objections to some choices by the Unicode committee.  So I guess the command prompt still defaults to that encoding for compatability (presumably a lot of command-prompt software is legacy.)"

ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,ColinFly,2,Tue Jul 21 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"It's in the FAQ. Do you insta-kill with Samurai until he's 2500? Then you're ready to switch.  I'd bring up your gold ancients to around 160 before doing so though, and leave 1 gild on Samurai. The new 2x multiplier and your high amount of gilds fucks with my perception to deem you ready or not just by looking at your ancients. My senses tingle no, but if what you say is true then you are definitely ready for Atlas.   Not Terra, though, not for long."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,frankje,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:58 2015 UTC,"For Atlas and Terra, you don't need a transition gild on anyone. They come soon enough that it's possible to make it there with ungilded heroes."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,Master_Sparky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, no (and also true for Phthalo btw). I know because I used to say that all the time in the past, but his high amount of gilds can make it tricky in the beginning. You are usually ready to switch with around 80-90 gilds on Sam, not 112."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,frankje,3,Tue Jul 21 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"This info is in the FAQ. If you can insta-kill with Samurai at hero level 2500 it's time to regild.   You are nowhere close to Terra, though. That's around 500 Siya but you are really close to Atlas which usually is around 180-200 Siya."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, I usually give people a respectful amount of crap about not using the FAQ. Turned on me, eh. Either way TY everyone for the quick responses! I'll be grinding a couple more ascends and then take the plunge."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,j_rodman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the shifting of gilds at the breakpoints is a very mild improvement in DPS/power.  Basically you shift when Atlas becomes slightly better than Samurai.  As you continue to gain in power, Atlas will become more significantly more efficient.  The initial switch is a fun milestone, but will only significantly improve your gains if you've waited longer than is optimal.  Likely you're just experiencing the game slowing down, as it does increasingly from this point onward.  Frankje has given some reasonable suggestions on improving your ancient efficiency, but based on your words I kind of suspect you may be ""pushing"" too hard and going to inefficient levels.  To optimize advancement, remember that levels that go down trivially give you the most souls per time."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,Master_Sparky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"If you can instakill with Samurai level 2500, which you should be very close to (if not already there), it's time to switch. To reach Atlas you can level ungilded Samurai up to level 1600-1700, or level Dread Knight to 500."
ClickerHeroes,3e4fet,frankje,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"With a Siya that low, you can't afford to stop at 1600 Sam, when Atlas unlocks between 1675-1700 Sam, if you care about efficiency. At least not for the first couple of runs."

Yep you have the right of it. Raise Solomon to 750, Morg to 1,044,484 (or close enough to that), and I think from the quick glance I took you're ready to keep going, raising Siya and rebalancing as you go."
ClickerHeroes,3e4cwd,Awlcer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:59 2015 UTC,Should I raise Morg first or Solomon? And is it necessary to level Iris?
ClickerHeroes,3e4cwd,Awlcer,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"Probably doesn't matter too much. What I'd do is dump a number into Morg every run like 25k-50k remainder into Solomon and roll the rest over on the next run.   The big thing is fixing both before progressing.   Forgot Iris. If you're pretty active and can keep up with a 30 minute run, then just keep her so you're getting about 1000 zones of instakilling (works out basically to optimal ascend point - 1001). If you're doing like 33 minute runs because she's a little low it's not the end of the world."
ClickerHeroes,3e4cwd,Master_Sparky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"I would take Morg to 1 million first, since it's so much cheaper than Solomon. You should raise Iris to 1000 zones below your optimal ascend point so that your runs are 30-35 minutes long."
ClickerHeroes,3e4cwd,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, as you said your Morg and Solomon are really underleveled (especially Morg, damn...). Focus on raising Morg to 1 million and Solomon to 750. Other than those to I see no problems in your ancients.  You are no where near Banana I'm afraid. That usually happens around 2k Siya."

ClickerHeroes,3e484s,mrbud4,3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"Epic/common/etc seems to be meaningless, as far as I can tell.  At Solomon 1258, it's a no-brainer to keep relics 1 and 4.   The -2% hero cost from relic 5, imo, isn't bad.  I'd gesstimate it over the +15% additive to solomon in relic 2.  3 seems better than 2 as a no-brainer for completely idle.  So overall I would probably drop 2.    Edit: There's also the condensed wisdom of relics, which ranks the bonuses as something like atman > revolc > dogcog > fortuna .  That would also suggest 5 (dogcog) over 2 (solomon)."

ClickerHeroes,3e484s,j_rodman,3,Tue Jul 21 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"%Primal Bosses > everything else  Yes, that stat gets large priority over all stats. Which is why this choice isn't totally vital. You will eventually replace relics 2 and 3 with +% primal boss chance ones."
ClickerHeroes,3e484s,j_rodman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly how Solomon scales, so using my own save numbers..  I have solomon 1698.  This gives +1898% primal hero souls. Adding +15% primal hero souls gives a total of 1913% primal hero souls.  That's a an improvement of 0.57% souls per time unit.  (there's a base 100% before the additions so compared 15 to 2013).  meanwhile, Atman 25 provides a 50% chance of primals per level (improved from the base 25% chance)..  Adding on 4% gives  a total of 54% chance, or an in improvement of roughly 8% souls per time unit.  (This is slightly false due to guaranteed souls at levels x100, so i guess we can take away 1/25th of that improvement, giving a 7.68% improvement).  Short version: yes."
ClickerHeroes,3e2h7v,RyoKouhei,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"This would be fun. Like, +4% Primal Boss Chance, but also +25% Hero Level and Purchase Cost."

Unspent souls will give me 11% DPS right? So shouldn't the no. of souls in Morgulis be the equal to the no. of unspent hero souls in my hand?"
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,Svayam_Bhagavan,4,Tue Jul 21 19:09:16 2015 UTC,Souls in Morg give 11% DPS. Unspent souls still only give 10%.
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,Master_Sparky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:41 2015 UTC,So is there any use of keeping your hero souls unspent after each regild and levelling up heroes?
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,Svayam_Bhagavan,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:17 2015 UTC,What do you mean after each regild? The only real reason to keep unspent HS with Morg is if you're either focusing on only leveling one ancient (Solomon for example) or if you're saving up to summon an ancient. Otherwise it's just a waste.
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:50 2015 UTC,So I have to spend all remaining souls on ancient improvement?(morg)
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"No, not on Morg. Your Morg is at the right level for you right now. Spend it on what I said above (Solomon to 100 and gold ancients to 93)."
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:02 2015 UTC,But in the future I need to spend it on improving Morg?
ClickerHeroes,3e3sao,SuperSmurfen,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:16 2015 UTC,Your Morg should be equal to Siya2 . If he's lower than that you should level him. If not you should level other ancients.
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,Svayam_Bhagavan,4,Tue Jul 21 19:03:27 2015 UTC,The amount of hero souls you lose from the bosses you skipped is negligible compared to the gain in souls per hour from shorter run times.
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,Master_Sparky,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:01 2015 UTC,This is the answer I was looking for. The other guys are giving me the cost of levelling up Iris. So shorter time is better than lesser no. of souls I collect?
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,SuperSmurfen,6,Tue Jul 21 19:13:32 2015 UTC,Well that was incredibly unclear in your post...
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,Awlcer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:24 2015 UTC,Sorry. Will try to be more clear next time...
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,SuperSmurfen,3,Tue Jul 21 19:16:31 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. You need to be able to efficiently perform the run in the projected amount of time consistently otherwise you hemorrhage hs/hr; the higher the Iris the bigger the hemorrhage.
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,CiroGC,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"Edit: Nevermind, misunderstood the post."
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,SuperSmurfen,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"I have Iris currently at 217. I want to know from level 100-215, how many hero souls did I loose? Or can I go back to the previous boss levels and get the hero souls?"
ClickerHeroes,3e3sad,SuperSmurfen,0,Tue Jul 21 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"He didn't ask for the Iris price, he already has a level 217 Iris. He wants to know how many HS does he lose by skipping those levels.  To answer OP's question, that would depend on your Solomon and Atman level."

ClickerHeroes,3e3qtp,Nosfrat,0,Tue Jul 21 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"Should I re-gild into Atlas?   No, Terra.   When should I get Morg?   You should have a while ago.  Anyway your ancients are weird, fix that first. Take Argaiv to 660, the gold ancients to 600-620, Solomon to 500-550 and get Bubos and Revolc. You should have about 480K banked souls, or 440K levels in Morg."
ClickerHeroes,3e3qtp,Inderriegel,0,Tue Jul 21 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"so, a couple of things to do:   *1. definitely regild into atlas, a rule of thumb is to regildinto atlas when you can instakill until samurai is lvl         2500, and regilt into phtalo once you can instakill with atlas up to him being lvl 1500   *2. Morgulis is a good investment right now, all he does is increase your damage by 11% for each herosoul you put in, so after you put in all your herosouls your damage increases by 1% per soul, therefor you want all your souls you dont spend on other ancients in morgulis   As an added note, you should upgrade solomon a bunch of levels, aim for it being at around 75% of your siyalatas level (would be 495).By the same logic your gold ancients should be at around 93% of your siya, and argaiv should be around the same level. For more details regarding leveling your ancients check the rules of thumb: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClickerHeroes/comments/339m3j/thumbs_up_the_rules_of_thumb/"
ClickerHeroes,3e3qtp,Master_Sparky,0,Tue Jul 21 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"Your Siya is way overleveled.

I'm lazy and not motivated to run the numbers.  However, once you can afford to move them readily yourself, it seems not useful.  Edit: To clarify, the total cost or maxing this ancient appears to be something like 1313 (sum of 11.5 + 21.5 ...)  That's not that big, and might eventually pay off (I estimate over 64 gilds).  However, the cost of summoning ancients goes up with one more ancient, making the increase in summoning costs something like 5k -200k depending upon whether you avoid certain ancients forever.   This makes it likely that for many players (depending on ancient order and how long they play) it may never pay off."

ClickerHeroes,3e3in1,jayhawk03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:22 2015 UTC,if you click on a Hero that already has a Gild it costs 2 HS to degild them. It will go to a random hero. You can use the Gild calculator to see which gilds are coming up next. The Control button just skips the are you sure screen.  The Shift key moves a gild from a randomly selected Hero to one of your choosing. That costs 80 HS.

Assuming you're past 140, the amount of HZ you would get from a QA would almost always surpass this value. I'm not sure entirely on the maths, I'm sure people will explain it much better than I can."
ClickerHeroes,3e2ab3,rkscythw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:38 2015 UTC,The cheap gold and cooldown reset is interresting for deep runs but it's probably still not worth it in the long run. In terms of actually reaching a higher soulcount the only thing pushing further on a deep run gives you is gilds and achievements and I've got a feeling straight up buying gilds or QA's is more worth it. The correct choice is probably still QA since it's still the only actual investment but I'd be even more tempted to buy gilds for the swag with these costs.

ClickerHeroes,3e2l55,steve_80,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some problems with your ancients. They're all out of ratio. Your Argaiv and Siya should be the same level, so raise Argaiv to 454. Your gold ancients are really underleveled. Raise them to 422. Your Solomon is underleveled as well, should be at least 340. Raise Iris to 103. Lastly, you need a bit more unspent HS, about 250k.  To reach Atlas just keep leveling Samurai. If you want you can leave one gild on Samurai as well (though many people find it isnt necessary). And were ready for Atlas a while ago. You're getting close to Terra even."

ClickerHeroes,3e2l55,SuperSmurfen,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is a quite common problem (but easily solvable). I said this in a previous thread:   There are two ways to deal with Iris:   The easiest way. Save a clickable before you ascend. After you ascend click it, get a bunch of cash and start killing. The gold you get is based on your highest unlocked zone. If you forgot to save a clickable what you do is something called the Midas Start. Turn off progression mode and kill on lower zones until have enough gold to buy 100 levels in Midas which unlocks golden clicks. Activate golden clicks and turn on progression mode (i.e go to your highest zone) and click away. You will get a bunch of gold and you're on your way again.    I have an Iris at level 1399. This is what all mid/late-game players do."

ClickerHeroes,3e2l55,j_rodman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:48 2015 UTC,The actual formula is Argiav = Siya + 9 but that's basically the same as the same level. And of course it's telling you to put all HS in Morg. When you have Morg all unspent HS is a waste since a regular HS gives 10% while a HS in Morg gives 11%.

ClickerHeroes,3e241e,mankl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:05:20 2015 UTC,"Well when you ascend you have enough money to buy sam, because he is cheap as hell. But Atlas is pretty expensive so how do you get enough money to buy that dude."
ClickerHeroes,3e241e,The_Chosen_Kappa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:07:31 2015 UTC,"You basically use Samurai as a ""stepping stone"". So basically, you do as if you had all gilds on Samurai and you level him up to ~1600-1650 iirc and you will normally be able to buy Atlas after that. The transition should be smooth if you regilded at the right time, so if you stop instakilling while leveling Samurai, you did it too soon.  Verify that you can instakill with Samurai while leveling him up to 2500, and that you have 200 or more Siya."
ClickerHeroes,3e241e,Nosfrat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:08:25 2015 UTC,"Siya level 200 isn't needed. Now with the x2 multiplier and relics, you can probably instakill to Sam 2500 earlier, perhaps 160-170 or so."

ClickerHeroes,3e19ic,SNIPER1K2,5,Tue Jul 21 04:34:53 2015 UTC,"The reason why mammon is vital is because he's a multiplier. So base gold gets multiplied, and remultiplied, and remultiplied for chests, and then you have a 10% chance for another multiplier.   So no while he doesn't increase in power himself he augments the power of your other ancients which allow combined with them and your DPS to sustain increasing amounts of gold which gets converted to DPS and then converted back into gold; on and on until the chain reaction falters."

It allows the game to progress readily after the initial grinding. In the not too distant future, you won't even bat an eye at dropping a hundred levels at a time into the first three I mentioned. Solomon, I'm afraid, gets painful, but has easily the most important effect on gameplay. He degenerates to 1% per level and his costs become extreme.  Short answer, no, the percentage will stay at five per level but you won't care because SolomonHeroes.jpg."

One can hope :p Not a huge loss if it didn't, but if it had helped you find a possible bug, then that's all the better!  Tab seemed to have closed while I was away for dinner, wasn't sure how, so I started it back up again. It loaded up a save that wasn't mine, where the highest zone was 80 and it hadn't even got a single ascension on it. The clan tab however, worked perfectly fine, I could search for a clan and everything.  I put in my actual save file, the one I've been playing on, the one I created the Justatest clan on. I was asked to enter a nickname, I put in the same one as I did before, cheken.  I had the option to create a clan or search for one again... That wasn't right, I HAD a clan... I created it, nobody had the power to kick me from it... I searched for the clan and there I am, on the members list... http://gyazo.com/33c3a8daac2677ec02bb0757afe3e75d  Now I'm even more confused lol  EDIT: Thinking about it, I know that I did start a short run on clickerheroes.com a while ago, but didn't get very far before moving to steam. Could that save possibly have conflicted with my imported save on the test game and created two instances for the clan data, therefore causing conflictions with which save I might be using and which one is in a clan? Wouldn't imagine it would, but it's possible I guess"

ClickerHeroes,3e0uiv,m1j5,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Um, I've seen relics that give over +30s to skills, and I'm pretty sure I've seen some over +40s, so they can certainly add more than 15 seconds.    And the relics that need more balancing, in my opinion, are the ones without an ancient cap...the Siya, Libertas, Bhaal, Frags, etc. relics are pretty worthless as is, even for lower level players."

ClickerHeroes,3e0uiv,walrusgod0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:23 2015 UTC,"That is true, but the way I look at it, they've given relics stats that are near useless even to low level players.

ClickerHeroes,3e25kd,MontRouge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:32:12 2015 UTC,"According to the rule of thumb, you probably want to keep Siya2 * 1.1 soul count banked.  So for Siya level 14, you would want at least 196 souls banked, while for level 17, you would want 289 souls banked.  At higher levels a more accurate ratio is, apparently, (Siya + 22)2 * 1.1.  I don't know what the transition looks like, but obviously that formula demands too many banked souls at say Siya rank 1."
ClickerHeroes,3dzgdw,Svayam_Bhagavan,6,Mon Jul 20 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"/u/Nosfrat has the highest optimal zone of anyone right now, around 2800 I believe. No one is even close 4k, or even will be for a very, very long time. On deep runs, on the other hand, many people have gotten to 4725 which is the highest you can achieve (after that mobs have infinity HP).  That being said, I've gotten somewhat far. I ascend regularly at around 2500. My dps ancients are 13k, gold 11k, Morg 169 million and 5k Solomon. I get between 2-2,2 million per ascension. I've played for ~8 months. First 1-2 quite inefficiently though."

ClickerHeroes,3dzgdw,SuperSmurfen,5,Mon Jul 20 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"To reach optimal zone at 4k? Probably longer than a human life time. Seriously, that's ridiculously high. Considering Nosfrat just regilded to Astaea (last hero) now at 2800, your dps would be really inefficient since you can't gild to a better hero.  Edit: I just played a bit with the calculator and even with 100k dps ancients (took the calc like 5 min to calculate) your optimal zone is still only 3k. So in conclusion: Longer than a human life time seems correct."

ClickerHeroes,3e016d,p4rk3rpwn5,9,Mon Jul 20 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"You don't wait for a clickable, you leave one when you're close to ascending."
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,Nosfrat,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:30 2015 UTC,Clickable is the easier way.  You can do a Midas start which means you just get a hero to farm enough gold for Cid lvl 25 and King Midas lvl 100. Then you go to your highest level (in this case 115) and use Clickstorm and Golden Clicks.
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,VaniSh98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:52 2015 UTC,u only need Cid lv 25 for clickstorm
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,Renzjordan1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:37:11 2015 UTC,Yeah realized it now as well. Thanks.
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,VaniSh98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"I would go farther and say clickable is the much faster, more efficient way.  But yes Midas start is a better recovery than many other options."
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,j_rodman,2,Mon Jul 20 23:00:24 2015 UTC,Yeah of course clickable is the better way.   Just he asked if there are other options so I told him about the Midas.
ClickerHeroes,3e016d,VaniSh98,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"You can use Midas Start:   Ascend and level up heroes until you get to level 100 Midas. If you Khrysos this will be extremely easy since you can just buy 1 level in Natalia and go to zone 60-70. Buy Golden Clicks upgrade. Optionally, you can also get Clickstorm from Cid. Turn on Golden Clicks (and Clickstorm if you bought it) and auto-progress mode to skip to highest zone. Use Golden Clicks on the monster. You now have an appropriate amount of gold to kill the mobs on your Iris zone."

ClickerHeroes,3e0zzn,j_rodman,3,Tue Jul 21 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"im guessing it means just farming an instakill boss, no i dont think thats very optimal"
ClickerHeroes,3e0zzn,m1j5,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:55 2015 UTC,"Your ancients are making me cry. Get Morg to 692k, Argaiv to 819, Mimzee, Lib and Mammon to 753, Solomon to at least 600, bump Iris up to ~300, and move 9 gilds off Samurai onto Terra. Once you do that, you'll be close to ready to regild to Terra.   As for your questions, offline farming is really rather immaterial at this point. I'm around your level, and leaving the game offline for 10-15 hours nets me about as much gold as 15 minutes of active playing. It's the exponential nature of the game."
ClickerHeroes,3e0zzn,Shadowbane92,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:17:33 2015 UTC,being able to kill a boss in under a second is instant killing

ClickerHeroes,3e0zzn,m1j5,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:45:24 2015 UTC,so I should farm at the level before the boss to get the ancient abilities?
ClickerHeroes,3e0zzn,j_rodman,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"well really u should be ascending before you need to farm a level to progress, if your talking about farming offline then yes, go to your farthest zone that isnt a boss and farm that"
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,Haxplosive,3,Tue Jul 21 02:21:59 2015 UTC,"Dora and Mimzee should be your next two ancients. They work in tandem to give the biggest boost you'll get this early. You won't be able to really capitalize on Atman/Solomon this early. Also, you should be netting more than ten HS per run unless you're absurdly unlucky. By the time you pass 140 you'll have access to 7 guaranteed (12,000 hero levels and Omeet).  Use some of those extra hero souls you've got and go for Mimzee and Dora. They'll probably push you to 250+, at which point you can random-gild in to the power five. Then Kuma/Atman/Solomon/Argaiv, moving everything to Samurai when you're comfortably hitting 500."
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,Zehr_Verlegen,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"Since not every post in here is good, i will just you the simple idle guide which answers all your questions, so bookmark and read him multiple times."
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,ElCattivo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:08:41 2015 UTC,"My rule of thumb for hybrid builds is to branch in that direction when you think that playing the game actively (clicking and activating skills) as a matter of course will make it more fun for you.  There's no real need to ever branch away from a fully idle build.  And it's very hard to say anything authoritative about when it will be optimal, because that depends so heavily on how you end up playing.  As for when to move gilds to Samurai, it's a little early for that.  But you can definitely, if you like, peck away at it by using the random-gild-move function to kick a few off your worst heroes per ascend.   You ideally want them to pile up on treebeast, ivan, brittany beach princess, samurai, and forest seer.  it's not necessary to get them all on Sam to get a notable boost."
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,j_rodman,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Pick up Dora and Mimzee as soon as you can without going below Siya2 * 1.1 banked souls. Keep putting levels into your ancients until you can get to 250 in under half an hour. Your gold ancients should be at Siya * 0.93. At that point, you want to use the 2 HS regild to move your gilds onto Treebeast, Ivan, Brittany, Samurai and Seer. Then pick up Atman and Solomon when you can afford them without breaking your bank. At this early stage in the game, you want Solomon = Siya, but that will drop down when he gets prohibitively expensive. Basically you want to keep Solomon as close to Siya's level as possible for as long as possible. After that, you can pick up Kumawakamaru either before or after you regild to samurai, but after Solomon and Atman.   When you get your ancients to the point where you can get to 450 in under half an hour, you want to regild everything to Samurai, again using the 2 HS regild. At that point, you also want to pick up Argaiv, and keep his level at Siya + 9. After this, you can pick up Bubos, Dogcog and Fortuna when they won't cost too much, it's pretty fluid for them, and the order isn't really important. For an Idle build, Vaagur is pretty useless. Morgulis and Iris; you want to pick up Iris around the same time you get Bubos. Dogcog and Fortuna, and you want to get her to 103 as soon as possible, then forget about her for a long time, until your optimal gets above ~1100-1200. Morg you pick up shortly after Iris, and he becomes your new soul bank. Keep him at (Siya + 22)2.  When you get to the point that you can instakill all the way to Samurai 2500 [this should happen at ~ Siya 200 or so] You then move all your gilds to Atlas using the 80HS regild. You use the 80 HS regild because the time it will take to move them with the 2 HS regild is better spent farming souls, and it may even cost more than 80 HS with poor RNG.  From there the game becomes farming HS to increase ancients until you instakill to level 1500 of your chosen Ranger, upon which time you regild to the next, and rinse and repeat. As for when to go Idle, I think /u/nosfrat said it was at about Optimal 1800, but I can't quite recall."
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,Shadowbane92,0,Tue Jul 21 08:09:18 2015 UTC,"i think the rule of thumb for hybrid builds is u start using them when ur at optimal 1600, as for iris the calculator will let you know when to put stuff into that, rule of thumb for iris is to do optimal-1000 but i think you get it to 104 a lot sooner, for solomon calc will tell u  EDIT: strt regilding onto sam when you can reliably get past 500 in about an hour, again calc should help with that"
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,m1j5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:26 2015 UTC,Does that mean that I should just follow the process of levelling up my 3 idling ancients until I can reliably get into lvl 1000? And just follow the strategy I've been doing lately?
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,m1j5,0,Tue Jul 21 02:36:45 2015 UTC,"no ur for sure going to want to get more ancients before that, check the FAQ for exact timings on it but for instance ur going to want fortuna,dora,mimzee,morg and others all before 1000"
ClickerHeroes,3e0uns,m1j5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"I've read through the FAQ concerning Ancients, but it's still not really clear to me. When should I be getting those ancients you mentioned? The most reliable source of information would be a calculator, I reckon? Although when I paste in my save, it tells me that Kumawakamaru, Ancient of Shadows: 23 souls (0% increase). Solomon, Ancient of Wisdom: 8 souls (-0.2% increase) are ''suggested''. Does that mean that I should be buying those now? Or should I be buying those when those net me a bigger % increase."

This can also be viewed as (Siya2 * 1.1) = Hero Soul Bank.    Unfortunately this formula vastly underperforms for low-level Siyalatas.  You need to have over Siya 100 for this to be remotely correct."

When you get to the late game, being able to put more than 4-5 levels into him per run means he's underleveled.  That should happen when you get around 4K Solomon or so, that's when his cost starts to get out of hand. Possibly a bit later if you keep your Solomon that low.

This game is all about earning HS to progress and you think the one ancient that directly increases that won't help you? Solomon is everything. It is the easiest way to make you progress faster and probably the most important ancient of them all to have at the correct level. Raise it at least to ~250.  As for your ancients, your Argaiv is really underleveled raise it along with Siyalatas to ~320. Also raise Libteras and Mammon to 300. With Morg you shouldn't have unspent HS so spend it all on what I said above and raise Morg to ~120k."

Around lvl 125 should be the optimal zone for you now. So just get to this zone and ascend that will optimize your HS/h.  Edit: Try to level your gold ancients for now you Siya is quite high.

As the game stands right now, if someone new would come into the game right now they would have access to every feature clicker heroes has to offer within a day or so. The only way to balance what you are suggesting would be for the tree tab unlocks to cost A lot of souls, why? Because your tree unlocks would basically be ancients that cap at level 1 and double something. This would also synergize highly with ancients like vaagur and berserker, which not only increase the timer on a skill, but reduce the time it takes for the skill to come up. There are also ways of using both of these and their corresponding relic to get some of the skills to have no cooldown at all."

Double the effect of energize would be a 4x energize every 15 minutes which you would use on dark ritual which would be on a 1 hour cooldown from a 15 minute reload... every 4 hours it would be a 2x multiplier to all of your dmg since a 4x multiplier to dark ritual would be 1.054 which is 1.215.. now, 1.2154 is 2.1... which is basically a 2x increase.. unless Im getting something wrong from dark rituals."

ClickerHeroes,3dxric,999avatar999,11,Mon Jul 20 12:14:16 2015 UTC,In my opinion two weeks of offline farming will give you as much gold as 15 minutes of active play. So just forget your plan.
ClickerHeroes,3dxric,XOGKushX,3,Mon Jul 20 12:19:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, the farther you go, the better because the gold is based on the monsters HP multiplied by some constant, so it's better to be on an extremely high zone where you can hardly kill a monster since the only gold difference between a low and high zone is the time it takes for the ""death animation"", so being in a high zone will let you have less death animations, therefore less time wasted for monsters to die and more gold. Not only that, but when being offline, it will ""average"" the gold you get, so even if it takes 1 year for you to kill a monster, when you come back, it will give you the part of the gold of the monster. Hope that was clear enough...  So tl;dr go to the highest zone you can reach."
ClickerHeroes,3dxric,The_Chosen_Kappa,3,Mon Jul 20 12:23:30 2015 UTC,Actually the gold formula changed to give an average of the number of kills you made instead of a gold equivalent. That's why Timelapse goes to 0 gold when you're on a deep run.

But on a regular basis what I enjoy is doing a few deep runs, usually with one that takes me significantly farther than I've ever been, and saving up my souls until I can do one giant dump into all of my ancients.  Smaller, quicker upgrades just doesn't do it for me."

If I guild everything into Atlas I would first have to play ""less idle"" to get there.  But if that really is the best option, I guess I have to that.

ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Master_Sparky,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:33 2015 UTC,I second this. The first one triumphs the second one at your current stage of the game.

ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Master_Sparky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:04 2015 UTC,4% of double rubies sound like a lot though. Do you think one can prove mathematically which one is better?
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Nosfrat,5,Mon Jul 20 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"Here. The Dogcog and Fortuna bonuses, while good, aren't really high enough on that relic to make enough of a difference."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Master_Sparky,0,Mon Jul 20 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"The second one is definitely better. The first one might have a more immediate and direct effect, but in the long run the second one will help a lot more."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Nosfrat,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"What's your justification on the second relic? Unless the 1% hero cost and 0.5% 10x are a lot better than I thought, Solomon bonuses have been objectively proven better than Revolc bonuses until a high leveled Solomon, which OP doesn't have. And by the time he does get that far he'll likely have replaced the relic altogether with a +% primal bosses."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,frankje,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I just feel like those three good bonuses outweigh an extra 20 levels in Solomon, especially that early in the game where you can very easily get those 20 levels.  I might be wrong, but double rubies are useful in general and the other two effects complement each other nicely.  But anyway, neither of those have +% chance of primal bosses, so it's really not that important which one OP keeps, as he's likely to salvage it soon."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,lilheartless,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"yes, that's the last spot without the +%chance of primal bosses"
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,frankje,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Fun fact. When you have a level 100 Solomon, a +20% Hero Soul bonus is better than +3% primal bosses."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:32 2015 UTC,the more solomon levels you have the stronger % primal bosses becomes.
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,Awlcer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Rather, the more Solomon levels you have, the less valuable +%Hero Soul-relics becomes. +% primal boss-relics stay static regardless of what stage of the game you are at.  And I never implied primal boss relics were less than optimal for anyone gilded to Terra and beyond (assuming you have an appropriate build), but it's ignorant to assume/imply no other relics can compare with them for each and every player."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,999avatar999,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"Second one. First one isn't bad, but the second one has three good effects."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"You could pretty much say either/or. The 20% would be something like 2% increase in hs/hr, while the other one is roughly the same or fractionally better. Going from a post I half remember seeing and could never find again 4% double rubies is worth approximately 1.75% hs/hr, while 1% Fortuna is about 1% per hour so in this case maybe half a percent, and 4% Dogcog is about 1% so roughly .25%.   I could be mistaken but since the second relic has 3 good mods tho at lower values it should be roughly the same."
ClickerHeroes,3dyseh,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:24 2015 UTC,I would say the second one.

ClickerHeroes,3dyp9p,Requiem_Dream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"Raise Dora and Mimzee to 20. Put those 192 HS into Morg and raise it further to ~490. You got Morg too early but since you have it there's no reason to have unspent HS. Get Atman and raise it along with Solomon to 20 and get Kumawakamaru as well.

Yes, he's gilded atm, but see #2.  2.Start slowly ungilding your bad gilds.  Start with Dread Knight and/or Grant, as those are your two worst atm.  Only spend about 10% of a run's earnings de-gilding, at most(so..17 this run), personally, I'd stay closer to 1%.  3.I feel like you're diving way to deep for as few souls you have, but I honestly can't remember the exacts of optimal zone that early into the game.  What I can say is don't wait around once it gets sluggish, just check the next boss and ascend.  Eventually, you'll start ascending as soon as you start 1-shotting, but I'm not sure if you're there yet or not.  4.Like SuperSmurfen said, Atman is HUGE atm.  Get him and love him.  You really should've gotten him before Morgulis, but you're too deep for it to be worth fixing."

ClickerHeroes,3dyk1w,LinusGale,4,Mon Jul 20 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"I would argue against steps (4), (7), and (10).    You generally never want to level Frostleaf past level 100 since it's pretty much a waste of gold, and he doesn't become more efficient than the early heroes until you're gilded on a ranger anyway, making him useless.  The only heroes you want to ever level up are Treebeast, Ivan, Brittany, Samurai, and possibly Seer. You don't want to stop at level 1000, that's just when they start to get good. Keep going for those 4x multipliers. And as for the last one, if you've blown all your abilities, it's a waste of time waiting for them to recharge.  Always ascend if you can't make meaningful progress in under a minute or so, and once you get into mid-game, you'll want to ascend when a boss takes more than 3-5 seconds to kill."
ClickerHeroes,3dyk1w,Master_Sparky,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! So I should stop leveling Alexia/Natalia/Mercedes/etc at the level they get their last upgrade? About ""wasting time for skills to recharge"" I think is not a big deal because the time it takes from a boss to another + a maxed Vaagur makes this wait only a few minutes long. The HS you get from the boss should be worth the wait, no? Mid-game starts when I can reach zone 500 in a regular (not deep) run, right?"
ClickerHeroes,3dyk1w,Master_Sparky,0,Mon Jul 20 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"As many people will say, the thing that matters more is HS/hour, not HS/run or HS/primal in your run. Those 5-10 minutes waiting for skills would be better spent blowing through the first few zones to get back to easy primals. It took me a while to get that and as a result I seriously slowed down my early game progress. Mid-game starts when you gild onto Atlas."
ClickerHeroes,3dyk1w,j_rodman,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Really early on (a bit earlier than you), I would actually do the math among my available heroes to figure out which x25 increase gave me the most dps per gold.   It would tend to move around, and wasn't always the cheapest option, but it was usually among the various recommended heros: treebeast, ivan, brittany, sam, seer.  At certain points, heroes lower on the list would be more cost efficient, but they were never contributing more than 1% DPS or so.  Thus, while it's technically not optimal to just buy the cheapest one, it probably is just fine to buy the cheapest one  - the cheapest among the most efficient."

ClickerHeroes,3dyhc7,YoHommie,0,Mon Jul 20 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest leaving Mammon and Mimzee alone for now, and focusing on Siya/Lib. Take them to 8-10 with 120-130 HS, then look for Dora and start leveling the other two.  You're doing good, it's just that very early game IS grindy as hell.  Use this to list your stuff."
ClickerHeroes,3dyhc7,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:22 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! When should i get morgulis?
ClickerHeroes,3dyhc7,Master_Sparky,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"You should get Morgulis a lot later, once you've gotten all the ancients from this guide."
ClickerHeroes,3dza97,Jamp42,4,Mon Jul 20 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"Well saying he hasn't grinded any bosses is a plain lie. That's simply false and impossible.   As for 17 HS, that's with some luck but definitely not impossible. He gets 8 from hero levels and 1 from Omeet, meaning he got 8 from primal bosses between 105 and 145."

Well, let's count all possible primal souls without ever ascending (levels 100-145): 1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3=17. And he already has 8 HS from hero levels, so it's entirely possible. He was just lucky.

ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,berbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:00 2015 UTC,"need wayyyy more in morg, about 200k i think, also u need a lot more ancients like bubos and kuma, dogcog, focus on getting those 3 first then lvl dump morg thenlvl solomon and get iris somewhere in there"
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,m1j5,0,Mon Jul 20 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"You badly need Kumawakamaru, buy and max him as soon as you can. After that, get and max Dogcog, Fortuna, Bubos, and Revolc. Then get Iris and level it up to level 104 for now, and keep Morg at Siya2 souls."
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Master_Sparky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:22 2015 UTC,what means siya 2 souls? like twice amount of siya for morg?
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Master_Sparky,0,Mon Jul 20 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"Siya squared, or Siya level times itself."
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,j_rodman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"Your current Siyalatas level is 451.  To get Siya2, you take the value times itself.  For your current Siyalatas level, that's 451 * 451, or 203,401.  Of course you have 50,118 unspent souls  so that's similar to having 45,562 souls in morgulis.  Along with your other efforts to normalize your ancients, you should steadily raise morgulis towards 200k before raising siyalatas further."
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Nosfrat,0,Mon Jul 20 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"Morg to 205K, Libertas/Mammon/Mimzee to 420 (yes blaze it etc.), Argaiv to 450, Solomon to 360, get Kuma, Dogcog, Fortuna, Bubos, Iris (103) and Revolc."

ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Master_Sparky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:27 2015 UTC,"clicking ""Q"" lets you put x9999 levels at once into him :)"
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,m1j5,0,Mon Jul 20 15:37:48 2015 UTC,"To add onto that, pressing Shift, then Q, and holding both down at the same time helps circumvent some of the lag associated with pressing Q."
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Master_Sparky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:40 2015 UTC,if u hold down q when clicking it will lvl it 9999 lvls at a time
ClickerHeroes,3dydfq,Nosfrat,0,Mon Jul 20 15:40:47 2015 UTC,Just wait till you're in the late game and need a level 100 million+ Morg.

ClickerHeroes,3dy8ka,Syllenia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"Solomon needs an extra 15-20 levels, rest looks good. Keep an eye out for Morg, and you're probably very close to regilding Atlas."
ClickerHeroes,3dy8ka,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:50 2015 UTC,And maybe try to keep your gold ancients on the same level (444 > 246). Not that drastic here but just for the future.

ClickerHeroes,3dy8b4,Ichiorochi,3,Mon Jul 20 14:43:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the opposite. With a level 60 Siya, Morg should be close to 4000, so yours is badly underleveled, which in turn means your soul bank was way too low."
ClickerHeroes,3dy8b4,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"posite. With a level 60 Siya, Morg should be close to 4000, so yours is badly underleveled, which in turn means your soul bank was way too low.

You could probably start regilding Sam, but you're not quite ready for a full regild yet, so do it slowly, i.e. move a few gilds per run.  Once you have everything on him, look for Dogcog and Fortuna, and Bubos a bit later."
ClickerHeroes,3dy7kw,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:43 2015 UTC,but you're not quite ready for a full regild yet   Why? I did a regild to Sam today with Siya 50 and other ancient levels according to it and it went alright.
ClickerHeroes,3dy7kw,curiosity_a,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"It's usually recommended to do it when you can get to 500+ easily / instakill to 450+. With OP's highest zone being 453, he's not quite there yet. It obviously wouldn't hurt him too much to regild now, but waiting a bit might be slightly better.  Not sure since he has Argaiv, and at a high level."
ClickerHeroes,3dy7kw,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well my highest is 453, but i didn't do any deep runs, i get to 453 in around 20 minutes and almost instakill :)"
ClickerHeroes,3dy7kw,Nosfrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:41 2015 UTC,"Then you're definitely ready,but you should probably go a little further.  20 minutes is really short, and about 1/5 of your run time is completely wasted going from 1 to 100, which gives no souls at all."

ClickerHeroes,3dvr5w,Xeno234,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"an autoclicker still does something for you. If you use mouse keys you're more effective than using just the mouse, but at least you're still the one actually hitting the button. Some people (including me) prefer it that way."

Do you mean that you press the keyboard keys over and over and over, or do you mean that you hold them down?

ClickerHeroes,3dwrx8,NapalmFlame,3,Mon Jul 20 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think this comes down to fuzziness in what it means to instakill. My working definition is that no enemies in the entire run until that point manage to fall to the ground.  If you fall below instakill, like having enemies last for 0.1 second instead of 0.05 seconds, on the way to to your new hero, I don't think that will have a significant effect on the overall efficiency of the run.  If you fall to taking 10 seconds or something, then maybe you regilded too early.  P.S. By ""regild from Terra to Ranger"", do you mean Phthalo?"
ClickerHeroes,3dwrx8,j_rodman,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"For clarification purposes, I'm taking instakill as a 1 frame kill, and falling just below that goes to a 2 frame kill. And yep, I mean him. Thanks for the info!"

ClickerHeroes,3dwgzu,GeneralAtrox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"Heres what I do, use the standard task list that comes with it, straight after the FIRST ""BuyAllUpgrades"" after Atlas (25, 75, -1). Delete anything past that point, except the ""Ascend"" bit. Then just add in what you want in between.   So you probably want something like, 25, 500, -1 (level Atlas to 500 with no upgrades, replacing -1 with 0, 1, 2 and 3 correspond accordingly to the upgrades), then Tera 26, 200, 3 (level Tera to 200 with chosen number of upgrades) then 27 etc...  You Also need to make sure you have a clickable on screen if you're using Iris ready so it can fully level up everything up to the point you want it at straight away, it takes a bit more configuring when you're in the earlier game since you need to figure out what you can do."

(not upgrading any other heroes or anything else.) and it clicks really slow too. So the levels start to drag on obviously. I havent modified anything in the Taskline, so I don't know whats wrong there.  I also tried disabling auto click, and running another autoclicker. But again, it upgrades cid some (in increments of 1 btw, cant that be 10x or 100x?) and then kinda...stops/goes back to clicking even if I disabled it? I'm really not too sure what happens there.  I'm playing the web version, does that have something to do with it? And I did set the location if that helps :)  Thanks for any insight you can provide!  I'm stupid, I only had to enable scientific numbers and individual hero dps and it works like a charm! Testing more now! Thanks again!"

Hell the OCR might fail anyway because it's not like it was rigorously trained with machine learning, it was a guy that looked at each of the characters in the number strings and then came up with floating point numbers and metrics like, ""percent above the horizontal split"" to guess which number each one was."

ClickerHeroes,3dxjjj,Siibeeyy,2,Mon Jul 20 10:50:46 2015 UTC,"The calculator doesn't pay much attention to gold ancients unfortunately, I've been told that you keep argaiv ~= siya  and the gold ancients i think is siya * .93 no doubt someone will reply with more accuracy but also make sure you keep morg at siya2 so that it stays relevant"
ClickerHeroes,3dxjjj,Nosfrat,2,Mon Jul 20 10:58:31 2015 UTC,"This thread has only two posts and it's already a train wreck.  First of all, I suppose you've been using this calculator which I really should delete from the FAQ. Do NOT use it, it's completely obsolete.  Second, take a look at this thread, it'll help you more than any calculator will, as there is no calculator currently up to date.  Following that, you should take Argaiv to 500, Mammon/Mimzee/Libertas to 470 and Solomon to 400. You should also put all your gilds on Terra, and buy Revolc."

ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,SwingLowSweetDeej,13,Mon Jul 20 00:35:42 2015 UTC,Since clans are small you should be able to find one with 9 other decent people

ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Veese,6,Sun Jul 19 19:34:39 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe this game will be dealing with the same level of toxicity as LoL or WoW.  A very high percentage of people who post here  seem very nice and friendly.

ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Master_Sparky,3,Sun Jul 19 20:07:37 2015 UTC,That is very true.
ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Randizzle8625,3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"I myself have tried out Clans but didn't really look at the message board. I myself play on Armor Games and they have a new chat feature on their website (not a game feature but website feature) and it is useful.  As for the clans, you basically kill a Boss in a group and get extra Hero Souls per day. The damage you cause is based on how many Primal Bosses you kill before selecting Today's Raid. The Raid Boss isn't unique to each player. So if someone defeats the Boss, it will appear defeated for everyone else."

ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Veese,2,Sun Jul 19 21:22:04 2015 UTC,My point is this type game doesn't attract the same trolls (or drunk 20 yr old college students) as a WoW or LoL type game.

I'm sure there are people out there playing CH who would be toxic when given unfettered access to a message board.  It just takes one person to start spewing offensive nonsense for the entire thing to devolve.  I also don't think the standard of ""better than LoL or WoW"" is a very high bar to be setting.  I'm hoping that, as a community, we would expect to be better than those games, and should strive for being a place where everyone feels welcome, even if we don't agree with them (or they want to play a non-efficient build)."

ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Sliverious,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"But we have to try, and having a reporting system in place can at least help a little. I'm not sure how much effort should be made for this sort of thing for this particular game, but I know that certain posters here have been systematically harassed with downvoting campaigns. It's pretty mild and the targets have evidently laughed it off, but it is evidence that some sort of policy is required here.  Even beyond that, the devs need to be aware of the fact that this is their in-game chat system (I'm assuming it is in-game and not part of Reddit, I haven't seen it myself) and therefore they are responsible in some fashion for the activity within it. Having a policy and even loosely enforcing it will help a long way if the shit hits the fan."
ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,SwingLowSweetDeej,4,Mon Jul 20 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll reach any meaningful middleground here, as I am currently of the opinion that the best government for this kind of community might be self-government and a form of social control, although the latter already exists in some form with the voting on posts. As somewhat of an experienced internetuser I've seen my share of communities, the good and the bad, but the most relaxed, inviting and interesting forums have been the ones mostly left unmoderated. Sure, you find some darker sides of the pool of ideas humanity has managed to produce, but when left to speak freely, people tend to be more honest en upfront. Ofcourse this al comes down to a matter of preference on the scale between chaos and total control."
ClickerHeroes,3duyuo,Master_Sparky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"I've not been on many gaming chat rooms, but the message boards I have been on all had some kind of moderator and terms of use policy. I do agree that self monitoring can work, but I don't think this chat room will be one of them. While you and I (and others, obviously) were older when message boards began to be common-place for many people, we need to think about young and inexperienced users who do not know how to handle even the softest of teasing, and this board has a good potential to have these users in large numbers. The post voting here on Reddit does work to some extent but the post is not deleted, just hidden, and I for one click on all of them, just to see what is going on. I doubt the in-game board has anything like this.  I agree this should not be a hugely complicated mechanism, but some sort of terms of use need to be in place when the in-game chat feature gets out of beta and on the main website/Steam/Kongregate/Armor Games."

I plan on reimporting my save back to steam from the test if I can though for the extra HS gain, so thought it worth mentioning for those that plan to do the same.  Will be interesting to see how the raids progress in terms of reward vs difficulty, the first one died in about 3 clicks from my damage at the end of a normal run solo, so I'm expecting it to get exponentially harder after a few days to account for a full 10 man guild possibly fighting them"

At this point, I am clicking until Level ~1590 (Phthalo level ~1200)   Get your Iris up to (at least) 399, assuming you are instakilling every 250 levels in Iris will save you 7,5 minutes. Also start clicking a little bit later and wait until Potato got his 1000 modifier, which should get him up to instakilling again and start clicking once he falls off again, but not immediately, wait a couple zones.  Also you are clicking too long, dont wait till crits arent instakills, use 2-3 skillcombos and ascend. Check this thread for some skill combos too test."

Most people like to pop one or two combos and ascend, but if you can click fast I think your method actually gives the best souls per hour.  To cut down on run time, level Iris. Your runs are over 1500 zones long, most people recommend 1000. At this point your optimal zone isn't increasing much so you'll have a chance to catch up on Iris, level ot to 500 or so for now."

Some of the heroes don't provide any bonuses, like the druid forest seer, or Samurai, so there's no need to level them.  However, I find it easier (as I expect most do), to just level all of them, then hit the buy all upgrades button.  So I still agree with this advice.

At that point in your ancients, many different heroes will work to get started.  Before that I used the Dark Knight.  Sure the DPS might be lower than Samurai (I don't know how they compare ungilded), but the point is everything was insta-killing.  I just found it more convenient to go down the list and then click atlas many times to get started then to stop at Sam.  I might have felt differently if Sam was on the initial screen.    This is obviously not an important tradeoff though."
ClickerHeroes,3dwu7j,j_rodman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"Phthalo is after Atlas, and if you're talking about using sam - Sam stays relevant because of the 2000 level buff, by them time I'm up to levelling atlas I'm parallel levelling sam and thats where the damage from sam eventually dies, I don't buy dread knight anymore on any run"
ClickerHeroes,3dwu7j,Siibeeyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand.  If your gilds are piled up on Phthalo, by that point you should have enough levesl in Iris to buy Atlas from the start, or at least Dark Knight.  And meanwhile, you should have so many levels in Siyalatas, that your choice of hero to level at the start is not very important.  Optimizing the damage of Atlas vs Sam by the point you have Phthalo gilded doesn't matter, because the monsters won't have enough hitpoints to last a frame either way."

ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,kbungz,3,Sun Jul 19 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Well they both need levels. Solomon should be at at least ~200 and you should try and slowly level Iris to 103. But your gold ancients need levels as well. They should be at ~210 and raise Argaiv to 228 as well. You're also ready to regild to Atlas so do that. Lastly, why do you have so incredibly many unspent HS? When you have Morg you shouldn't have any at all. Spend that shit immediately on what I mentioned above."
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:09 2015 UTC,ok thanks. i just thought that the % damage that the HS give would help me but i guess spending them is a better idea.
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,SuperSmurfen,2,Sun Jul 19 21:34:28 2015 UTC,HS is incredibly important but when you have Morg unspent HS are ineffective. Instead of jumping into Morg and bringing 11% per HS they just lay there lazily giving 10% per HS (excuse the half assed metaphor). But even then you have too many. Your Morg should follow this formula:  Morg = (Siya+22)2  Which for you is 62.5k in Morg
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,xMWJ,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:58 2015 UTC,ok thanks a lot.
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:37:58 2015 UTC,When do you stop using the morg = siya squared and starting using the rule you mentioned?
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,The_Chosen_Kappa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:41 2015 UTC,Whenever you feel like adding an extra (44*Siya+484) levels into morg isn't that much anymore.
ClickerHeroes,3dvgpr,SuperSmurfen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:52 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, this formula works starting from Siya 100+ since after that point, each level in Siya gives a constant +15%, which the math of the (Siya+22)2 is based on. But 100 might be a little too early, because (Siya+22)2 is actually not really accurate, but it gets more accurate the more levels you have in Siya."

ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,dukC2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"The seeds in this game are all static. It work the same way as an ancient or gild calculator works.

ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Rukie_the_Ripper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"out of curiosity,I notice it is outputing stat attributes could you also get the distribution of the values of attributes for a given lvl? such as primal chance for the higher lvls (like 1, 2,3%.. etc)"
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,dukC2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, so long I as I look at only relics of a certain level. This code is displaying actual items from a save file; it doesn't isolate certain levels. There would be easier ways of obtaining this information."
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Rukie_the_Ripper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"When your Iris is more than 7/15 of your HZE it follows the spawn range formula [Iris zone, Iris zone + HZE/5]."
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Master_Sparky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"The question is whether the chance for each zone in that range is the same, or if it is not. I myself do have the same experience, although I write it off to confirmation bias. You could ofcourse test this somewhat crudely by writing down the relic spawning zones over a large number of ascensions."
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Sliverious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, in OP's case, his actual relic zone is [1799, 2405]. So it will be spawning closer to the start of [1799, 2620] which is the range he incorrectly estimated."
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Master_Sparky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for calculating the correct range, I didn't bother with it myself. The question about the algorithm used to determine the spawning zone still remains though. I just skimmed over the thread about relics and I can't find what function is called for the 'random zone"". It's quite probable ofcourse that the programmers just used whatever random number generator the language in which CH is written has, but who knows. :P"
ClickerHeroes,3dvciv,Sliverious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"That makes my range 1799-2404, which makes more sense."
ClickerHeroes,3dviqp,FancyMancis,6,Sun Jul 19 21:45:17 2015 UTC,You break idle mode if you either use an ability or click to attack a monster specifically. Clicking anywhere else won't break idle.
ClickerHeroes,3dviqp,Master_Sparky,2,Sun Jul 19 21:49:02 2015 UTC,"If you click the bee and it gives an ability other than clickstorm, it won't break idle. But that's the only exception afaik."

ClickerHeroes,3dviqp,TheRegularHexahedron,0,Sun Jul 19 21:54:32 2015 UTC,"I believe you have to click twice in a 5 minute period to leave idle mode. So you can use one ability without breaking idle mode, but not two."
ClickerHeroes,3dviqp,Master_Sparky,6,Sun Jul 19 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"Abilities unfortunately break idle mode anyway, even if you only use one."

With the advent of relics I get enough gold from treasure chests (I also get an added bonus to get treasure chests) that I can get from my OL of 2330 to level 2420 in a matter of an extra 2 or 3 minutes.   I usually watch a movie or play another game while I play CH, so going hybrid would just interrupt that for me. To each his own play-style though."
ClickerHeroes,3duvkj,Master_Sparky,2,Sun Jul 19 18:56:10 2015 UTC,"Generally you want to go hybrid when your Siya is level 1200-1500. When you do, you'll want to pick up Fragsworth, Bhaal, Pluto (1/2 of Siya), Juggernaut (1/10 of Siya), Chawedo, Sniperino, and Hecatoncheir (max). Possibly Vaagur, Chronos, Kleptos, and Thusia too if you plan to use them in deep runs."
ClickerHeroes,3duvkj,Randizzle8625,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I myself plan on going Hybrid once Siyalatas is level 2000.

Chronos and Thusia are more optional ones as you don't really need them but they can benefit you. As of right now, Khrysos is obsolete thanks to Clickable Treasures."
ClickerHeroes,3dw120,Drot1234,3,Mon Jul 20 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"the reason you switch gilds is very simple, its all for the multipliers.  all of the rangers (dread knight up) have 5x multipliers from like (? 4xx - 7xx) so they get more damage for the same cost then and then the 10x multiplier at 1000.  the reason you regild is because atlas ends up with more damage than samurai because of the multipliers for the same cost.  The reason you regild to terra is because once you hit the 10x multiplier with atlas it takes another 1000 levels for there to be another big damage boost while terra @ the same cost and with comparable gilds will have comparable damage but will reach the 1k damage boost sooner than atlas will reach the 2k damage boost making it more economically efficient to switch to terra, and by the time atlas will reach his 2k 10x boost to be comparable you will have already regilded to terra and there is no point in going back and this trend follows all the way down the rangers.  As a side note the reason that people don't gild onto dread knight is because without gilds on samurai its very hard to get to dread and by the time you can easily get to dread knight without gilds on sam you are about 2 - 3 runs away from efficiently gilding onto atlas which makes it completely pointless to gild into dread ever."

ClickerHeroes,3dw120,angrybaldguy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:53 2015 UTC,He really isn't going to do a significant amount of damage until he is your gilded hero.
ClickerHeroes,3dw120,Master_Sparky,2,Mon Jul 20 00:24:18 2015 UTC,But why is he a better hero to be gilded than for example samurai? Is it because he stop getting bonuses around lvl 4000 or something? Is there a reason to gild atlas before i get to that point?
ClickerHeroes,3dw120,angrybaldguy,3,Mon Jul 20 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"But why is he a better hero to be gilded than for example samurai?   Because the way the hero multipliers and damage cost efficiency work, he becomes a better choice when you can easily get him to level 800-1000 or so. Until that point, Samurai is the better choice, and since level 2500 Samurai is the same cost as level 800-1000 Atlas, we have the rule of thumb for instakilling to Samurai level 2500."
ClickerHeroes,3dw120,Swithe,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:14 2015 UTC,"Generally people switch their guilds to atlas once you can instakill up to samurai 2500.  I haven't actually seen the math, but Atlas is suppose to be more cost effective at that point."
ClickerHeroes,3dw120,Master_Sparky,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"4,100 is the final x4 bonus. after that you dont get anymore so its time to upgrade to atlas then later the other rangers  also, the bonus for the first few gilds is HUGE so he might be 0.13% now, but just a handful of gilds will push that beyond 50% easy."

ClickerHeroes,3dvntt,Sw1ftb,2,Sun Jul 19 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think its no suprise that adding another few minutes of instakilling to a run would be effective, so the question that riddles me is how much can you add without slowing down too much and where the border is.  For example 3-9-3 are 3 guaranteed minutes of instakilling and every other avaiable skill before that gives you another 1,5 minutes, but im wondering if it would be possible to add a fourth combo to that. I came pretty close but not close enough for my taste, so has anybody managed to achieve 4 combos of near instakilling (without relying on crits) in at max 3-4 hits?"
ClickerHeroes,3dvntt,ElCattivo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"From my experience with an active build, the skill combo makes all the difference. It's hard to make a recommendation without seeing your time/zone from zone 2200 on but I'll say that staggering your skills might help push that efficiency higher.

ClickerHeroes,3dxoyw,m1j5,3,Mon Jul 20 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"So basically you're saying relics should be nerfed?  That'd make them LESS interesting. Yes, for now it's pretty straightforward, but nerfing the best effect isn't a solution. Buffing up the other effects so that some of them are viable is a better solution.  However there's another problem. This game is about souls, everything in CH is based on souls, so anything that affects souls to a decent degree (i.e. not the Solomon relics) will always be what you should be using.  Of course there could be stupid ""overpowered"" shit like -25% hiring cost, +10% chance of x10 gold and stuff like that that could actually be better than Atman relics in some situations, but I feel like the game is complicated enough for an incremental game, and I like knowing what to go for in most situations without having the rocket science degree needed to calculate it yourself."

Once you do, click it, and gain enough gold to purchase the heroes you need to beat level 80 (or whatever level Iris brings you to).  From the FAQ (about clickables):   Clicking one of them will either award you with a Ruby or Gold that is ten times the amount you'd have received from a regular monster at your highest unlocked zone, regardless of the zone you are currently on. They do NOT work like a treasure chest, and ignore Mimzee's bonus. However they do benefit from Mammon and Libertas.  They are typically used with Iris, the Ancient of Vision. Iris allows you to start at a higher zone, and clicking a clickable will give you ten times the gold of a normal monster at whatever zone Iris allows you to start off at. Doing so will give you the gold needed to instantly buy higher tier heroes, and start killing everything.   Alternatively, there's the slower method known as the Midas Start.  This is essentially:  1) Buy Natalia   2) Scroll through zones and click to get some gold   3) Level Cid enough to get Clickstorm   4) Level Midas enough to get Golden Clicks   5) Scroll/advance to furthest zone you can  6) Use Clickstorm and Golden Clicks"

ClickerHeroes,3duqt8,Ord0c,3,Sun Jul 19 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"That's generally the technique many people use.  As soon as a new hero is available, purchase it.  You should stagger the leveling just as you are, in order to get all of their skills while also gaining more and more DPS through newer, stronger heroes.  You continue doing this until you get to each hero's highest level that offers a skill/bonus/etc.    It's easier to buy hero levels like so: 1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, etc., since that's where their skills are.  Also, before you ascend you should level up all of your heroes, cheapest first, to get bonus hero souls.  You should easily be getting ~14 each time you ascend."
ClickerHeroes,3duqt8,idyl,3,Sun Jul 19 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Level one hero to level 10, buy the upgrade, start on the next hero to 10 while getting the last one to level 25, then go up by 25s (50, 75, 100 as you go up the list). You can then either stop at the last upgrade to a hero, or at level 200 if you like nice even numbers across the board. Eventually after leveling up Iris enough you'll reach a point where it's easiest to just hold down CTRL and dump 200 levels into everyone after ascending."

ClickerHeroes,3duede,Master_Sparky,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:47 2015 UTC,Energized Dark Ritual. Basically means you're relying on using Dark Ritual every half hour to increase your DPS.

ClickerHeroes,3duds0,The_Chosen_Kappa,2,Sun Jul 19 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't quite work that way because of how the 4x multipliers to heroes work.

Spend it on leveling up ancients and such. Those extra gilds you have on Alexa and Shinatobe are a bit strange. First of all both those heroes are heroes that don't have 4 damage upgrades, meaning they have very poor dps. You should probably just leave 1 gild on Samurai if you feel it necessary. If you like Alexa or Shinatobe or some reason at least just have 1 gild on 1 hero. 2 different is completely unnecessary."

On a relative scale though I wouldn't be at all surprised if your 115 did more for you than my 58k does for me.   I expect they will act in a similar fashion to hero souls. So for you adding 1million hero souls would probably be a lot. For me, it isn't noticeable."

ClickerHeroes,3dtypk,DarKxRaideR,4,Sun Jul 19 13:08:34 2015 UTC,"buying gilded heroes for the 80 HS?   I think you missed something. Using the shift-gild function for 80 souls moves a random gild you currently have onto the hero you choose. You don't actually get a new one, only rubies can buy gilds, and you should always be buying quick ascensions instead.  Also put all your gilds on Samurai, take Morg to 5K, Siya and Argaiv to 70, Solomon to 60 and buy Bubos."
ClickerHeroes,3dtypk,Nosfrat,6,Sun Jul 19 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"You missed Atman, which he needs terribly."

After you've fixed those levels, you should be ready to regild all your gilds onto Samurai with the 2 HS regilding. When you're done regilding, buy Argaiv and take him to level 70.

ClickerHeroes,3dtqm1,SuperSmurfen,2,Sun Jul 19 11:14:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, the idea of Thusia is to make chests last for a few seconds you can click a few times, but you still want to click the chest quite  quickly so you can get chests on higher levels and keep progressing. If your Thusia is too high you can get stuck on the same chest for the whole golden clicks duration, which is really bad.  And of course Thusia is only useful for deep runs. On your average soul farming run Thusia will do nothing."

ClickerHeroes,3dtqm1,jackwiles,3,Sun Jul 19 11:59:11 2015 UTC,"No problem :)   Since we're at it, I just looked at your ancients. Your Siya is a bit out of ratio. Raise Argaiv to the same as Siya. Take your gold ancients to ~615. Raise Solomon to 500. Also it's a bit too early for hybrid to be effective so stop leveling clicking ancients for now.  Lastly, you might have gilded to Phthalo too early. I could be wrong but usually Phthalo occurs around 1k Siya. You might want to regild back to Terra."
