CFB,3e2hx8,RegionalBias,20,Tue Jul 21 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"Schools choose how they punish drug test they pay for, Conference and the NCAA choose how to punish drug they they pay for as well. Schools are much more lenient. The NCAA and Conference have 2 strike policies, schools generally have anywhere from 3-5. No way OSU has a 2 strike policy, because schools test way more than NCAA and Conference combined."
CFB,3e2hx8,BluePenguin90,7,Tue Jul 21 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"This is correct. 2 failed NCAA tests and you are done. University athletic departments also test, those policies are different from school to school, but are typically more lenient."
CFB,3e2hx8,mmac2013,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many 'breach of team rules' suspensions and whatever are this precise thing. I assume it's about equal parts this, sleeping in, coming late, and other dumb college kid stuff(FHRITP)."
CFB,3e2hx8,SenorPuff,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"A lot. I would say the ""violation of team rules"" is 80% or more failed drug test (probably not the first failed either). I work at a small athletic department and it happens even more than you probably even think it does."

CFB,3e2hx8,Yesh,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: The SEC made some rule changes to slow this down. So let's recall that this is mostly talking about the past (My statement was that Georgia didn't partake in this, and hence was at a disadvantage to other SEC schools) Nor was the SEC alone in this, but success tends to up attention.      Wall Street Journal Article Saturday Down South CBS Sports Bleacher Report - Yeah yeah, bleacher report    Now, why people got ticked. It appears (take that as you will) that some universities were cycling through more students than they are allotted. That means they get more ""good"" prospects and can drum non-performers. Note: Some minor variance over 85 could be from players transferring or from the use of Jucos.    Mind you, if I remember correctly Georgia and Florida had under 85 during this same time period. That's two full classes less than some of these SEC teams.    LSU:  Class sizes: 2007—26; 2008—26; 2009—24; 2010—29 for a total of 105. South Carolina: Class sizes: 2007—31; 2008—23; 2009—29; 2010—23 for a four-year total of 106. Arkansas: Class sizes: 2007—27; 2008—26; 2009—31; 2010—25 for a four-year total of 109. Mississippi State: Class sizes: 2007—33; 2008—27; 2009—27; 2010—26 for a grand total of 113 players, 28 above the scholarship limit. Auburn: Class sizes: 2007—30; 2008—29; 2009—28; 2010—32 for a grand total of 119 players. Ole Miss: Class sizes: 2007—22; 2008—31; 2009—37; 2010—25 for a grand total of 115 players. Alabama: Class sizes: 2007—25; 2008—32; 2009—27; 2010—29 for a total of 113."

I have yet to hear about anyone getting forced off a team in favor of new recruits other than that article about the alabama guys that I am highly skeptical about."
CFB,3e2hx8,Yesh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Look: You asked for details. I gave details.    If you note, I was talking competitive balance / gaining an advantage through it, within the conference.  Looking at that list, the SEC West was getting many more players through than others, including the SEC East.     119 for Auburn in that period. 85 for others. That's getting an extra class and a half's worth of players. There are bound to be some gems in there.      Are you contending that those numbers didn't help those programs field better teams?"
CFB,3e2hx8,RegionalBias,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"Here's the wikipedia article. Skip to the references, they're pretty detailed. Oversigning was a much bigger issue about five years ago, and the SEC was the worst offender based on the data gathered. However, the conference changed the rules to lessen this behavior, and it has largely been effective in reducing the particularly shady practices like grayshirting and cutting kids to make room for new recruits."

CFB,3e2hx8,GAbrewdawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"As much as other teams from other conferences complain about the recruiting/disciplinary policies down here, we have more right than anyone.

CFB,3e2kbn,OceanPressure,5,Tue Jul 21 14:57:04 2015 UTC,US News and World Report called Cincinnati one of the hottest upcoming schools in the nation and our President Santa Ono has rolled with it making it a slogan for our school.  He puts it in every tweet he sends out and he tweets a shit load.

CFB,3e2kbn,jimmy4k,3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"The last three years we've gone 7-6, 10-4, and 8-5. We won the 2012 Armed Forces Bowl, 2013 C-USA Championship, and 2014 Hawaii Bowl. We got crushed by Dak Prescott and CLANGA in the 2013 Liberty Bowl, but hey, you can't win them all.  Our offense has been respectable for years, but the arrival of our current DC got us on this recent string of success. A lot of our defense graduated last season, so now we see if Thurmond is as good a DC as I think he is. The talent is there. Offense should be okay, as we return our QB and two leading rushers.  David Bailiff isn't a very innovative coach, but he has done a good job recruiting talent to Rice, which is no easy feat."
CFB,3e2kbn,Owlcatraz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you much about Rice, but Tech is looking to have another great season and most projections I've seen have either Tech or Rice winning the division"
CFB,3e2kbn,Braddo123,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"Probably Louisiana Tech; that game may determine who wins C-USA West this year, plus it's a night game, which is always a plus in Houston.

CFB,3e2kbn,cinciforthewin,10,Tue Jul 21 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"It's odd seeing Memphis being mentioned. They just came on strong the past couple seasons. If that coach leaves, they may fall back to mediocrity."
CFB,3e2kbn,fortknox,4,Tue Jul 21 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think there are a good number of people who are impressed with Memphis' potential. There isn't a pro-football team in the city, there is only an NBA team. The other competitors at or above Memphis' level is Ole Miss.   Memphis as a city and program certainly has the potential to be a strong contender in the AAC and maybe on a national level. Their football teams haven't demonstrated that beyond being fairly competitive the past few seasons, but I would like to see Memphis doing well."
CFB,3e2kbn,metzoforte1,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:04 2015 UTC,They had a solid 2014. Hopefully they keep it up because when the AAC divisions were set it looked like the West was basically going to come down to Houston vs Navy every year.

CFB,3e2kbn,JayRU09,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"The American is killed by parity in the top half of the league. Boise will dominate the MWC. Marshall will dominate CUSA. Meanwhile the American could go to Cincy, ECU, UCF, Houston, or Navy.  Add to that we all play solid OOC schedules (UCF is @Stanford and @South Carolina, for example) and I don't see anyone getting out of the AAC without 2-3 losses. So the Access Bowl will probably go to a 0 or 1 loss Boise or Marshall."

CFB,3e2kbn,lucky_whiplash,12,Tue Jul 21 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"sadly, I dont think any G5 team will make the playoffs.  I think they are trying to keep the P5 and G5 almost separate when it comes to the playoffs b/c the NCAA wants that money, and G5 teams just cant pull the viewership that a Michigan, Ohio State, or most P5 teams for that matter.  Look at last year, they picked only one G5 team to play in a new years bowl, when there were arguably 3 teams which could have played (Marshall, Boise St, and CSU).  I just dont see any G5 teams getting into the playoffs anytime soon.  I think you would need to see a G5 team go undefeated for 2 straight years before they get the chance to be in the playoffs.  Edit: But I see Boise St. or Marshall getting this years New Years bowl game."
CFB,3e2kbn,Tvwatcherr,9,Tue Jul 21 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"Look at last year, they picked only one G5 team to play in a new years bowl, when there were arguably 3 teams which could have played (Marshall, Boise St, and CSU)   They pick the NY6 bowls based on their rankings, and neither Marshall nor CSU were ranked highly enough (nor should they have been) to get into one of those NY6 bowls without the G5 auto-bid. I don't really think last season supports your assertion that the committee is actively deflating the rankings of G5 teams in order to raise viewership in the playoff.  I also do think that Boise State has a real chance to make the playoff if they go undefeated and there are 3 or fewer undefeated P5 champs."
CFB,3e2kbn,ExternalTangents,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they're actively deflating rankings (except that both Media polls disagreed with the PSC), but there is zero reason for them to stick their necks out over it that a G5 team would be able to make it in the playoffs.  It's going to become harder and harder for teams to ascend the ranks so the term ""Access bowl"" is a little silly."
CFB,3e2kbn,BraveSaintStuart,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"I just disagree, I think a G5 team with a strong nonconference schedule would have a reasonable chance of sneaking into the top 4. In the MWC and AAC, there are usually 2-4 solid teams, so if a team from one of those conferences schedules aggressively (~2 solid opponents) in their nonconference slate, they could easily finish with 2-3 wins over ranked teams, plus another 3-4 wins over solid bowl teams. That's not really much different than a P5 schedule, so if they went undefeated I think they'd be right in amongst or above 1-loss P5 teams.  In the other G5 conferences, it might take an additional major nonconference opponent, but a team like Georgia Southern or Central Michigan has the schedule to do it if they can somehow win out."
CFB,3e2kbn,ExternalTangents,7,Tue Jul 21 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"Marshall? I like them and all, but they've again got a really weak schedule and lost a good number of starters from last year, including Cato. They'll probably be a 9-10 win team, but I'd be very surprised if they were in the conversation for the NY6 game."
CFB,3e2kbn,MrTheSpork,4,Tue Jul 21 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"We won't go undefeated, is my guess. That'll be enough to end the conversation, as we saw last year."
CFB,3e2kbn,BraveSaintStuart,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we're the favorites for the Access Bowl, but we've still got the pieces to make another run at an undefeated season.    Devon Johnson ran for almost 1800 yards and is back as is most of the receiving corps and secondary. Cato will be replaced by a transfer who has a year of experience starting at JMU."
CFB,3e2kbn,BallSoHerd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"I am not disagreeing with you at all but I think it is sad.  I think it would be amazing to see what everyone would perceive to be a true underdog go head to head with the ""big boys"" of CFB for a championship.  Win or lose I would love to believe that if a G5 team made it to the playoffs people would  be ecstatic about it because no one would believe it happened.  Especially if it turns out to be a good game and possible the team wins the first game and/or the championship.  The money could possibly start going towards some of those G5 schools or conferences (at least to a certain degree)."
CFB,3e2kbn,captainstan,8,Tue Jul 21 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Cincinnati. With Kiel and the types of weapons they return at skill positions on Offense, I could see them being lethal this year. They also have winnable, OOC games against teams that aren't super dangerous but still carry some decent prestige with Miami and BYU. If they run the table, I could see an argument being made. However, they would still need help (as in at least 3 P5 conference winners with 2 losses or more). They're my trendy darkhorse this year-- I hope they have lots of success."
CFB,3e2kbn,elgambino,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"I hope Kiel tears it up, we always heard so much about him.  I just want to see him throw the rock all over the yard for 14 games this year."
CFB,3e2kbn,unittron,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:23 2015 UTC,He's just got to stay healthy this year. Last year it seemed every game the second half last season he'd take a shot to the ribs and he'd be out the rest of the game.
CFB,3e2kbn,sucks_at_usernames,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"With the weapons he has, I seriously think he's got a chance to really dial in and be a legitimate gunslinger. McKay, Washington, and M. Moore are all capable receivers/playmakers and Morrison and Holton just add to that depth (seriously, any of those 5 could get the ball on any given passing play). Boone should be the feature back for them and does enough to keep the linebackers and safeties honest. I really think they're deadly."

CFB,3e2kbn,ProfaneTank,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:40 2015 UTC,I hate to be biased but Boise State. We have lots of good returning talent even if we did lose key guys like Ajayi and Hedrick on offense. Our defense should be pretty solid.
CFB,3e2kbn,chubby_chubb,6,Tue Jul 21 17:20:29 2015 UTC,ECU fans: give me a rundown on expectations for this year and who to watch for on the team.
CFB,3e2kbn,Yesh,6,Tue Jul 21 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not an ECU fan, but I think I can speak for them when I say nobody has any idea what to expect from ECU next year. They lost Carden and Hardy, which were one of the best QB-WR combos nationally last year, but return nearly all of their offensive line which gives whichever new QB a relatively soft landing. Complicating the offensive side is the loss of their OC Lincoln Riley.  Their defense was a little above average last year, but they've only got 5 players returning from that squad and lose most of their DL. They were very good against the run last year, though, so the defensive drop shouldn't be too bad. That said, ECU really could not stop an air attack last year and most AAC teams, especially on the higher end, tend towards pass-first.  ECU will almost certainly beat UConn, USF, SMU, and Tulsa, plus their FCS warm-up, but after that most games are a bit of a tossup. If Florida doesn't improve much, that's a prime non-con win that ECU could pick up, but they play in Gainesville. Same with Virginia Tech, which honestly I almost see as a coin flip right now. The one good thing is playing BYU at home definitely gives ECU an edge. Playing at BYU isn't helpful, either, so that's another tough choice. I'd predict a 7- or 8-win season, but that could easily be anywhere from 6 to 10 wins, depending on how their QB and WRs step up and if the defense can fill some holes that existed even through last season.  As for players to watch, it'd have to be Kurt Benkert, who's likely the starting QB next year. ECU picked up a highly-touted QB recruit over the offseason, but I'd be surprised if he immediately sees the field. Rushing was by committee last season, so you'll see Hairston likely get the plurality with Scott and Grayson backing him up. Receiving falls mainly to Isaiah Jones, who snagged 850 yards last year despite being Carden's #2 target. Defensively, Lennon and Hawkins are consistent in the backfield, collecting 12% of the team's overall tackles, and Zeek Bigger will be fun to watch at LB.  Obviously ECU fans feel free to correct any of this, but those are just my thoughts."
CFB,3e2kbn,MrTheSpork,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say we don't know what to expect from the team as a whole, just the QB, which is obviously a big part of it. Other than that a pretty solid rundown."

CFB,3e2kbn,hokies220,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:38 2015 UTC,It's one of those games where you can usually just throw out the record books. RIP my blood pressure.
CFB,3e2kbn,Mamamilk,7,Tue Jul 21 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"ECU lost Justin Hardy(WR) and Shane Carden(QB) both of whom were extremely talented as well as half their starters from last year. I wouldn't expect them to perform as well as last year, but with Ruffin at the helm you can likely still expect a better than decent offense.   They get a rough OOC slate this year again with Florida, VT, and BYU. I really respect that though even if I don't think they will beat any of those three this year."
CFB,3e2kbn,hokies220,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!
CFB,3e2kbn,Yesh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"I think we have a better shot at beating Florida and BYU than VT. BYU has serious holes on defense and may end up as a shoot out. Florida is an enigma with their new coach, though I don't favor us in the swamp."
CFB,3e2kbn,Mamamilk,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:34 2015 UTC,I have no idea what to expect from Florida especially that early in the season. Y'all might catch them looking ahead to going to Kentucky seeing how close their game was last year.  Playing VT the week after playing Navy should be a win for VT.  The game in Provo comes midway through the season so we should have a good idea what to expect from each team. BYU plays the harder schedule to that point but they do get an easy game hosting UConn right before.
CFB,3e2kbn,hokies220,5,Tue Jul 21 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"Quick and dirty because I'm at work. If our new QB is serviceable, we should be fine. We have reloaded and then some at most positions.   The secondary will be more experienced and should improve talent-wise. Our linebackers are going to be great (two Butkus award watch listers in Zeek Bigger and Montese Overton), our d-line should be good again and has a guy (Terrell Stanley) coming back from a life-threatening injury who was a monster when he played two years ago. We just need to improve on generating a pass rush up front because the run D was great last year.   On offense we will be more than fine at WR as usual, you'll hear about Isaiah Jones at some point this year. Our RB corps will be deeper than ever this season, and will be RB by committee again with plenty of game experience. I actually expect us to run quite a bit this season behind an experienced O-line. Our TE, Bryce Williams is a potential draft pick with great size and blocking ability in addition to his skills as a receiver.   The big question is how our shiny new QB, Kurt Benkert, will fare. There is a very solid team around him, so a lot of it comes down to how well he does. I am confident in the kid as he was made the heir apparent to Shane Carden (over a few other guys) as soon as he came onto the scene. He is stronger and faster without a doubt, but I haven't seen enough in a game situation to comment on his accuracy or decision making.  In short, I think some of the talk about us falling off is greatly exaggerated and is coming from those unfamiliar with the team, because we have done a great job reloading and improving at key positions of need. We have a tough schedule but the potential to field another dangerous team."
CFB,3e2kbn,Mamamilk,5,Tue Jul 21 15:55:02 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've adopted you guys as my second team since I moved to NC. I'm gonna try like hell to get to a game in Greenville this year.
CFB,3e2kbn,Yesh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"Do it man, we welcome our purple and gold brethren. Get there early and let us know how well the game-day atmosphere stacks up to an SEC gameday."

CFB,3e2kbn,IratePir8,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:41 2015 UTC,Will do! Thanks.
CFB,3e2kbn,Yesh,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"Mamamilk gave a great rundown....I agree on pretty much all points. Just want to touch on some of the points:  Secondary: should improve talent wise, but we've been fairly weak for a while. Will likely be one of the weak points in our game.    WR: We will have a solid receiving corps, will see a drop at Hardy's position, but we are deep overall.     RB: Some of the most talented backs I've ever seen at ECU. We almost have more than we know what to do with. The ""more talented"" backs are still young but they're showing a lot of promise.  QB: Shane was a very smart and gifted player, he'll be missed. Benkert looks like a natural athlete with speed and strength, as noted above. If he is ""football smart"" he'll be a very good QB for us.    Stolen from another board:  I think we are going to look back on this coming season and say that  this OL is on par with the 1996 OL. We have 6 guys that have  started a lot of games.   Ike Harris 6'7"" 304 Sr  J.T. Boyd 6'4"" 302 Jr  C.J. Struyk 6'2"" 296 Sr  Dontae Levingston 6'4"" 311 Sr  Quincy McKinney 6'4"" 311 Sr  Tre Robertson 6'5"" 310 Sr   Levingston and McKinney appear to have gained a lot of strength over  last season when they got pushed around some (causing holding  penalties) because they have had a year with Connors.   Also, Larry Williams, 6'4"" 337 So, is a beast waiting for an  opportunity.    So overall, I think we'll see some growing pains from the big shoes to fill in Justin Hardy and Shane Carden, likely weak against the pass, but we've got options everywhere else. As long as we keep our penalties down and play smart ball, we should have a decent 7 to 8 win season."
CFB,3e2kbn,IratePir8,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"I agree regarding the secondary, we are improving but that isn't saying much. If Hawkins could play at the level he started at last season he could have a massive impact."
CFB,3e2kbn,Mamamilk,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly I can see anywhere from 9-3 to 6-6. Losing a 3 year QB starter in Carden will obviously mean some growing pains. Benkert, the odds on favorite to start at QB, had 2 years to understudy with Carden so I'm hopeful he'll step in and be up to speed quickly. Even though we lost a ton of catches in Justin Hardy, we're pretty well stocked at all of the WR positions. (I'm just seeing that /u/MrTheSpork pretty much nailed things...)"

CFB,3e2kbn,joelupi,5,Tue Jul 21 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Alright fellas who has the toughest OOC schedule in your conference. What OOC game(s) do you think your team will win/lose this year?   Ill start:  I think the toughest OCC schedule in the Sun Belt is held by ULM. With games @ UGA, Alabama (these 2 in the frst 3 weeks), Tulsa, and Hawaii it doesnt look good for the Warhawks.  For us:  9/5 @ WVU (7:30 EST; Fox South Net.) This one is hard for me. If you ask the WVU fans who have been talking trash on our board for the last month they will cover the 28+ spread on us....I personally think we have a better football team but its Morgantown and game one. It will be decided in the 4th and once again we will gain the respect of one of the 'big boys'. 31-28 GS  9-12 vs. Western Michigan (6 EST; ESPN3) I think this will be the best home game of the year. WMU is a solid team, with some real athletes. I think its close going into the 4th but its early September in South Georgia.  It will be hot, it will be humid. We take a 2 point possession lead going into the final minutes. If this game was later in the year I think it would be a nail biter but northern teams have never fared well in Statesboro when its hovering in the high 80s around 8:00. 35-21 GS.   9-12 vs the Citadel (6:00 EST, ESPN3) Old rivary. Should be a good game but our new depth takes care of business. 35-14 GS.  11-21 @ UGA (TBA) We have been playing UGA in 4 year increments(2008,2012..) for a while. We moved up, they changed their minds and rescheduled us for this year. Looks like they plan on not playing us for a while after this game, scared??? They got nothing to gain but a lot to lose by playing us. This year should be a lot different then what UGA fans are use to. Ive tried explaining the fact that we have 22 more scholarships compared to the other ass whopping we have received but it doesn't click. I think we have a good chance depending on what our record looks like. I think they pull it out in the 4th but not after we gain the long overdue respect of their fan base. 42-35 UGA."
CFB,3e2kbn,bigdoc91,4,Tue Jul 21 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"Be careful when looking at WMU. They will row that fucking boat so hard you'll want to go break every oar within 5 square miles of your stadium.

CFB,3e2kbn,Schtip,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:20 2015 UTC,Gunner Kiel by far.  I've seen mock 2016 drafts (I know they don't hold a ton of weight) that have him pegged as a top 15 pick and that's with him coming out a year early.
CFB,3e2kbn,GhostdadUC,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:53 2015 UTC,That is a very good question. I can't speak for the other teams but our highest picks will probably be Zeek Bigger (ILB) or Bryce Williams (TE). I'd be interested to hear who other teams have. I am sure Gunner Kiel will be mentioned.
CFB,3e2kbn,Mamamilk,4,Tue Jul 21 16:43:15 2015 UTC,How does Western Michigan look this year? Has the row the boat campaign worked at all?
CFB,3e2kbn,ncquake24,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"Returning starting QB who completed 70% of his passes last year. Preseason All American WR (albeit 4th team) who had over 1400 yds rec last year. Returning a starting RB who was freshman all american, MAC offensive player of the year and the MAC Freshman player of the year last year. They have a chance to win the MAC, but they open with Michigan State at home, @ Georgia Southern and @ Ohio State. One of the tougher non conference schedules in the country."

When I created the poll I didn't intend for it to be used to rank conferences.  I just thought it would be fun to try it out.  In theory ranking the teams the way I did shouldn't allow in conference play to affect things very much because every team has the opportunity to score a similar amount of points in the poll with each game, regardless of competition, but I need to do some thinking to see about making future adjustments.  And Thanks!  I'm actually already subbed :)"
CFB,3e2r75,CLSmith15,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"If anything I think this would favor the weaker conferences though.  Strong conferences by definition will have weaker non-conference schedules, allowing their members to inflate their statistics in non-conference play.  This makes it harder to pick up points in conference play.  On the other hand, members of weaker conferences will have their statistics deflate in non-conference play, making it easier to pick up points in conference play."

CFB,3e2r75,_edd,6,Tue Jul 21 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"Seems like a neat project, but a huge, glaring issue here for me.  How do you justify making a conference rating system when such a large % of the games are against teams within your own conference?    Doesn't this just essentially become a measure of a combination between which conference played the easiest non-conference schedule and which conference was able to dominate their non-conference opponents the most.  It seems like a conference would get huge bonus points for having huge statistical games in games against non-Power 5 teams that are competitive in their own conference.  For example, I'd think a game like Ole Miss's 56-15 beatdown over UL-Lafayette would look really good in this model because they (as one would expect any top-25 team would do) thoroughly dominated them.  However, UL-Lafayette probably has good stats for the rest of the season because they were 9-4 overall and 7-1 in conference."
CFB,3e2r75,_edd,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Using the comparative system I use this is significantly reduced because a team's performance is rated based on how other teams do against the same opponent.  You can schedule cupcakes, but they generally score fewer points with greater variance, which means that you can sometimes score more points in a tough close game than in a blowout.  The game you mentioned is actually a perfect example of how this model works to reduce the effects of blow outs.  Ole Miss had a score total of 1.008 for this game, roughly 1/3 of their average game score. If their entire season was comprised of games like this, they would find themselves in the #45 spot instead of the #10 spot they occupy in my poll.  It actually hurt them a great deal.  Edit: I done screwed up the numbers.  It does actually give them a boost of a couple of spots in the ranking, but it doesn't move them all that far."
CFB,3e2r75,_edd,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea behind this approach, since it manages to compare relative performance. Thanks for sharing it.   As with any ranking system, there are potential flaws or loopholes that could skew the data, and frankly this has at least one major issue.  Let's match up an FBS team vs. a good FCS team; for this instance I'll use LSU vs. Sam Houston St. who played each other in 2014. Sam Houston St. finished the regular season with an impressive record of 12-2 with wins as large as 76-0. So when Sam Houston St. played LSU and lost 56-0, LSU got an absolutely tremendous boost to their rankings. This Sam Houston St. game is, almost without a doubt, the largest contributor to LSU's rankings in this ranking system."
CFB,3e2r75,_edd,10,Tue Jul 21 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"Good News Everyone!  I ignored FCS teams because getting the data I need to post scores against them opens a rabbit hole that I don't dare go down.

CFB,3e2r75,_edd,3,Tue Jul 21 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"I have a spreadsheet that does the calculations, but it clears out individual game results after it calculates the team's score.

SHS's points scored, points allowed and other statistics are all also elevated because of their weaker competition. If they played a P5 schedule, there is no chance they would average as many points/game. So with this model, any P5 team would want to play against SHS because a win, makes it look like the P5 team defeated a juggernaut (even a loss wouldn't necessarily look too bad).  Fortunately, it turns out that /u/guitmusic11 excluded games against against FCS teams, so the effect of that flaw is minimized."

CFB,3e2r75,olbleedyeyes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:32 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense then. We run the ball a LOT so when we do pass its more often than not an intermediate to deep route to either pick up a first on 3rd/4th down or catch the defense off guard.

CFB,3e359i,NahNotOnReddit,0,Tue Jul 21 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think strength of schedule really factors into preseason rankings, especially not ones like this.  Edit Here's an article about what goes into Preseason FPI   Four components are factored into the ratings: prior years’ efficiency, information on returning starters, recruiting and coaching tenure.   So the ratings do not take into account schedule strength.  Another relevant portion [emphasis added]:   The projections will likely look different than the current rankings because the projections account for schedule. For example, LSU ranks third in preseason FPI, but that does not mean that the Tigers will win the third-most games or make the College Football Playoff. LSU plays a tough SEC schedule, including road games against Alabama and Ole Miss; therefore, the Tigers might not rank in the top 10 in projected win total even though they are one of the strongest teams in the country on a neutral field.   The projections are the win total numbers. The current rankings are the schedule-agnostic numbers by which the teams are ranked in this linked article.  If you sort by projected wins, you get the FPI projections for how teams will finish the season, based on record. That's the part that takes SOS into account. The last column, the FPI rating, doesn't take SOS into account and strictly rates how good it projects teams to be. It has an insane hard on for SEC teams, but it's not using SOS as an input to that rating.  Can someone explain why I'm being downvoted here, or is it just that I'm contradicting the anti-ESPN, anti-SEC sentiment?"
CFB,3e359i,ExternalTangents,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:59 2015 UTC,can someone explain...the downvotes   I'll give you one guess.

CFB,3e359i,NiteMares,11,Tue Jul 21 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly substantial part of the FPI equation, hence why Alabama is #2 despite being ""projected"" for 8.7 wins and Baylor is #3 despite being projected for 10 wins.  There's a few things that go into it.  Compare the other SEC teams (or PAC12, their SOS's are pretty strong) to their surrounding rankings and you'll see that it certainly at least plays a part."
CFB,3e359i,nolez,3,Tue Jul 21 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, my understanding of the in-season FPI is that it takes SOS into account for past games, and that only its projections for how the season will end take into account future games. Similarly, the projected win totals in this linked article take into account SOS, but the FPI ratings in it don't.  This description of the preseason FPI methodology seems to say that strength of schedule doesn't play into their ratings, it only plays into their predictive rankings, which take the ratings and then predict how the teams will do against their schedule based on their own ratings and the ratings of their opponents.  But what you're saying, I think, has the causality reversed. Alabama has a very high FPI rating because the factors that the FPI rates on (coaching, recruiting, last year's efficiency) are very high for Alabama. But their projected wins are low, because despite being a really good team by FPI ratings, they play a tough schedule and are therefore expected to win fewer games. So their SOS doesn't boost their FPI rating, it just diminishes their projected wins."
CFB,3e359i,ExternalTangents,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"I really wish ESPN would tell us how they calculate this. I'm really interested in how much recruiting rankings/ratings factor into FPI. That could explain why the FPI has such a hard on for the SEC. Returning starters is hopefully a lot more valuable than recruiting info is, because a returning all conference player is way more valuable than some 4* RS-Sophomore who only played on special teams."

CFB,3e359i,fua_neng,21,Tue Jul 21 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"These are absolutely abysmal. FPI is easily the worst of the major calculated polls.  The SEC SoS circular logic is already in full swing. 12 of the top-20 SoS calculations belong to SEC teams...Why, do you ask? Because the FPI equation is recursive, taking previous values and recalculating new values based on those tentative values. It's similar to how we calculate chemical bonding energies, where you make a first-order guess, then apply those calculations to the next round of calculations, then apply those, and the following, etc. If it is done correctly, the calculations should converge somewhere near reality, but we have evidence that FPI is useless. This suggests one of the following things: The equation used is bad (recursion does not cause the converge to a value, or weights the input data incorrectly), the recursion is too extreme (recursively goes back to its raw input values), the data input is bad, or there is no knowable way to calculate a single uniform and meaningful value from the data points they use...I think it is something like all of these combined.  We do not know the equation they use, the factors they consider, how they weight the inputs, or how they calculate SoS recursively. This is a closed, and thus impossible to trust source. Imagine if a company said ""we can make limitless energy, but you can't know how or why. Here's a closed-lab test which you cannot research directly. Invest in us!"" You would naturally be skeptical, and that is the necessary case here. They could literally have an ""SEC variable"" where any team in the conference or a team which played at an SEC stadium would receive a bump, but that is not necessary to get these laughable results. There is a black box which they put numbers into and out comes what is supposed to be received as a voice of authority, yet we know not where this wisdom comes from.  We know these use ESPN's recruiting rankings, but these are hit-or-miss at best, and truly non-predictive at worst. That is not to mention that they have (in my opinion) the worst recruiting rankings of ESPN, Rivals, and 247. We know that there is some sort of recursive formula in it which considers (at least) Strength of Schedule. How recursive and what that formula is, though we have no clue. We know that ESPN clears its previous year FPI rankings from its website. Barking Carnival has last year's pre-season FPI on its website (thank you /u/butchplz for linking). Preseason #3 Auburn ended up 8-5. Preseason #7 Oklahoma ended up 8-5. Preseason #8 Stanford ended up 8-5. Preseason #9 SCAR ended up 7-6. Preseason #10 TAMU ended up 8-5. Preseason #14 LSU ended up 8-5. Preseason #18 Michigan ended up 5-7. Preseason #19 UNC ended up 6-7. Preseason #21 OKState ended up 7-6. Preseason #22 Florida ended up 7-5. Preseason #24 Michigan State ended up 11-2, the first big miss on the list in the other direction. Preseason #25 Texas ended up 6-7. By my count, that's 12 of the top-25 with laughably bad predictions. Miami, Oregon State, Missouri, Arizona, TTU (33, but 4-8???), TCU, Indiana, Nebraska, Rutgers, and UCF are all among other humongously wrong predictions, and the list goes on and on and on. We know that ESPN relies on FPI for their projections and treatment of teams. No system will be perfectly successful at predicting records and skill, but we do know that the reliance on this formula is almost as bad as throwing darts. Hell, because it has a formula behind it and supposedly has scientific data supporting it, it's worse than random guessing because it changes the dialogue for the worse!"

In the totally unbalanced SEC, playing a full West schedule PLUS the two best teams in the East is brutal. That said, UGA has to play Alabama at home AND travel to Auburn, so our only edge is avoiding LSU. Otherwise our schedule and Bama's are a wash.

We've had 4 straight seasons of good starts, terrible finishes. I see no reason that won't repeat itself this year. I genuinely hope we look elsewhere after this season. There is no reason why he should get an additional year.  Additionally, had Oliver Luck not drawn up a bad contract, he might not be there right now."

I learned a lot about preventative officiating and sending out warnings and hot players and working with players to understand the mood of the game and prevent it from even coming close to that.   Those are extremely difficult situations to deal with and you have to find the fired up players and get them off the field ASAP... we all can't be mind readers, though...  edit: wanted to ensure I was saying this was a brawl in high school (my first year in varsity).

I have no idea how, but I slid out of that mess without a scratch. No one connected a punch on me and I stayed unscathed... until everything was finally calm (and about two dozen police arrived, it was two urban schools)... the offensive coordinator started screaming across the field to the other head coach saying there'd be more of the same if he kept trying to pass the ball instead of running out the clock... mind you, this was the winning teams offensive coordinator shouting at the losing head coach to stop trying to get back into the game.  And that was the first time I threw a coach out of the game. I haven't ever really lost my cool in a game like I did right then. I walked that coach from his bench to the end zone and quietly, but sternly ripped him a completely new asshole every step on the way. I walked him right up to a cop, told the cop to please escort the coach to the bus and he wasn't to leave that bus as he has just been ejected.  Again, was my first year in varsity, so I learned a LOT that game. Including how to control even my own temper. ;)"

CFB,3e2imt,TurboSloth9000,39,Tue Jul 21 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Underage players banned from the creamery.    It's going to make a tough first month even worse with suspensions
CFB,3e2imt,max_danjer,28,Tue Jul 21 13:46:40 2015 UTC,No church dances or being allowed to say prayers in church meetings for 3 weeks.

CFB,3e2imt,pierdonia,23,Tue Jul 21 14:15:04 2015 UTC,Because they've been punishing kids for having sex.   I'd say announcing punishment for assault is a little different than premarital sex between consenting adults.

CFB,3e2imt,dubsdcarson,4,Tue Jul 21 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"People love to go muckraking regarded honor code violations. See, for example, the time a Utah fan sent Utah's athletic department a picture of a BYU player drinking in Vegas, which they forwarded on to BYU  and culminated in various message boards and media outlets scrutinizing the guy's life.   After that and the 2011 incident, the school decided to handle honor code violations as privately as possible, not announcing violations or punishments. I support having a biright line rule because it should help shield players' personal lives a little better."
CFB,3e2imt,pierdonia,5,Tue Jul 21 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"I can understand that but, I think, with something of this magnitude, there should be a little more transparency."
CFB,3e2imt,dubsdcarson,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. Shielding someone from public shaming because they were drinking or having sex is one thing, and I can definitely understand the university keeping that kind of thing private.

We study together, work together, pregame together, etc...  Why did the umpire kill the clock? Because he heard a whistle. Whistle in the stands can kill the play. The ref looked at the side judge to determine how much time was supposed to be put back on the clock and they were getting another ball when the kid came roaring in to fight... Had that not happened, the refs would have ignored the streaker, reset the clock and play, and continued on, just like that.  The real issue was ALL the refs were worried about the ball and resetting things that no one noticed the brawl. The players are always first at any dead ball. We have that drilled into our heads... but situations like this one show that anything that takes you by surprise can take you off your game...  I hope that streaker got lynched for his antics..."

During halftime Baylor Homecoming floats paraded around the field. When a float - actually a car pulling a flatbed trailer with several female Baylor students - neared the section where the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets sat, a cadet raced towards the car and grabbed the steering wheel. The motion caused Louise Normand to fall off the truck, injuring her and inciting a large riot. Students began using metal folding chairs and planks of wood that had been used as yard markers for weapons. Texas A&M student Lt. Charles Sessums was hit in the head during the melee and, although he initially appeared to recover, he died following the game.  On December 8, 1926, the two school presidents agreed to temporarily suspend athletic relations between the schools. The schools would not compete against each other in any athletic event for the next four years. Baylor and Texas A&M would not meet in football again until 1931."""

CFB,3e2imt,SCsprinter13,3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"If our players ran through the warm-ups, it was more than 30 mins before the scuffle. The scuffle was caused when  Maryland players went across the field to start something with our players."
CFB,3e2imt,jaykyew,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:38 2015 UTC,What he's saying is that the refusal to shake hands was in response to the PSU players interrupting our warmups and starting the scuffle. A lot of people were under the impression that it was planned farther in advance in order to try and artificially start a rivalry
CFB,3e2imt,SCsprinter13,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:19 2015 UTC,My point is that it was clearly Maryland players starting the scuffle. They walked across the field to our side to start shit.

As the time in the video approaches 15 seconds he gets up and the two who were on the ground with him are joined by 4-5 more who all surround and close in around him.  There's been plenty of pre-game trash talk and bouncing around and then some rough play during the course of The Game over the years but it's usually just in the heat of the moment, pretty isolated (lots of DB's and WR's going at it 1v1) and over quickly.

With less than a minute to go, Rick Neuheisel calls a timeout when SC was taking a knee to end the game. As a response, USC scores a touchdown. That didn't sit too well with UCLA.

What's the fun of rivalries like that if there's no retaliation to dickishness? It didn't result in violence, the only effects were that Neuheisel caused his DB's to be embarrassed one more time. Sucks for UCLA, absolutely, but that's what you get for calling an unnecessary time out. This is a better fuel to the rivalry fire than a midfield brawl, that's for sure."

I'm sure people will come up with sources that go one way or the other.    With all that said, at the time the ACC generated more revenue than the SEC and had better academics.

Originally the BOT and Bobby were all about the SEC because FSU had been asking to join for years and finally had the chance. The ACC came along and made a great pitch that swayed all of the other coaches aside from Bobby and half the BOT. Because FSU was suddenly being courted seriously by another conference, the SEC pulled their offer because they did not want to get embarrassed if they offered and got beat out by the meager ACC"

I could be way off on it. It was one of those absurd periods when FSU flirted with the Big-12.

IIRC, they lost heart-breakers to Auburn and Bama, then Manziel got hurt and they tanked the last few weeks of the season.  In comparison, Duke had one of their best seasons ever.  I firmly believe in momentum and Duke clearly had the advantage going into the game.  When Manziel got over the hangover (pun intended), he DOMINATED that game."
CFB,3e2h8a,rmp0005,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:13 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the vast majority of our defense that night were freshmen and a few had hardly even seen the field yet. Like literally the thinnest most inexperienced defense you could possibly imagine for a FBS team (there's a reason we allowed a TD on every single drive lol). As far as why we werent scoring a ton out of the gate? That I'm not certain of but the point is that we shouldn't have had to score as much as we did  it did make for quite the dramatic finish though
CFB,3e2h8a,Colonel_Janus,0,Tue Jul 21 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"It's not just one game. Duke has been one of the better teams in CFB over the last 2 years - just no one has realized it yet because they have Duke written on their jerseys. They've won more games the last 2 years than Ole Miss, UGA, LSU, and A&M, just to name a few."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"Even though they have been down the last few years in varying amount, I think VT and Miami would be successful in the SEC. More so than Louisville."
CFB,3e2h8a,Just_A_Gigolo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way a team like Tech could hang with uga and Miss St.   Also, can we get the GT\Auburn rivalry going again?"
CFB,3e2h8a,beeblebrox42,6,Tue Jul 21 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Doesn't GT only have like 2 or 3 wins against UGA this millennium?   But, seriously.. It wasn't meant to be a slight against Tech.  My point was only that I do not believe Tech would find much success in the SEC.  Hell, there are half a dozen SEC teams that don't find any success in the SEC..   I would love for Auburn to start playing Tech again.  Especially if it means not having to play Clemson for the 900th time."
CFB,3e2h8a,rmp0005,0,Tue Jul 21 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"I would argue that there's about 3 SEC teams that have ""found success"" in the SEC.  Two of them are in Alabama and one is in Florida.  Those three teams have been beyond great for the recent past.  I think a team like GT or Duke or Miami would do just fine in the SEC.  Would they win it regularly, hell no.  But heck, Mizzou hasn't had much trouble finding success in the SEC and they were a middle of the road B12 team.  There's so much parity in the middle of college football you could plug and plan any middle of the pack team from one P5 to another and see little difference."
CFB,3e2h8a,beeblebrox42,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"I would add UGA and LSU to your list.  LSU has 'ships and even though Richt is the east coast iteration of Bob Stoops, he wins consistently.    I'll concede GT could potentially find success, contingent upon them starting a QB that can do more than shot-put the 10 yards up field.  Maybe recruit out-of-favor UGA DBs (worked for us).    You'd have to be a wizard to convince me that Duke or Miami would be successful though."
CFB,3e2h8a,rmp0005,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way a team like Tech could hang with uga and Miss St.    The hubris of SEC fans going into that bowl game against Mississippi state was mind-boggling."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:04 2015 UTC,Realistically you can make that argument for every conference though.
CFB,3e2h8a,ZombieFish15,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"To a degree. I think the ACC is improving quickly.  FSU and Clemson are recruiting juggernauts, Tech recently has been a QB (that can accurately throw a ball > 10 yards) away from making noise, and surely Miami has to return to being Miami eventually.  But as of right now, there is limit to their ceiling.  There are probably 6 teams in the SEC right now fully capable of winning the conference title.  That is conference depth imo."
CFB,3e2h8a,rmp0005,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think you're forgetting some serious contenders. Louisville has won 22 games the last two seasons, Duke has won 19 games. That's better than Ole Miss, A&M, UGA, LSU, ect have done the last couple seasons."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:24 2015 UTC,Louisville was in the AAC for one of those seasons. Put any of those SEC teams you just named in the AAC and we'll get double digit wins too.
CFB,3e2h8a,HissingNewt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:44 2015 UTC,Yeah and Louisville couldn't possibly compete with Florida /s  The conference wasn't just bad because you say it was.
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:03 2015 UTC,But you can 100% say with surety that Duke and Louisville would not have those wins if they had to play the entire SEC West every year
CFB,3e2h8a,Ezmoneh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"And we're back full circle. When you start with the assumption that you're better just cause, it's really hard to have an open mind about really good teams in other conferences.  Louisville plays in the ACC atlantic, which is nearly on par with the SEC-west (not quite), really close. The SEC West finished with 4 ranked teams, the ACC Atlantic finished with 3."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Haha ok buddy, you go ahead and keep thinking that Syracuse, NC State and Wake Forest are as good as Auburn, Alabama, the Mississippi's, Arkansas, LSU.    This isn't even serious anymore"
CFB,3e2h8a,Ezmoneh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Are you actually arguing that the SEC is equal to the ACC? Let's just compare the F/+ ranks from the two conferences for 2013. That should give a good idea of where all the teams were.  SEC 2. Alabama  SEC 4. Auburn  SEC 10. South Carolina  AAC 12. Louisville  SEC 14. Missouri  SEC 17. LSU  AAC 21. UCF  SEC 22. UGA  SEC 23. TAMU  SEC 28. Ole Miss  SEC 33. MSU  AAC 46. Houston  AAC 64. Cincinnati  AAC 83. Memphis  AAC 84. SMU  AAC 91. Rutgers  AAC 93. UConn  AAC 98. Temple  AAC 99. USF  I think that pretty much proves that the conference is not only worse than the SEC but below average in 2013. That's an average F/+ ranking of /#69 for the conference. So yeah, I think they're bad enough that A&M could cruise to double digit wins most years if that was our conference."
CFB,3e2h8a,HissingNewt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:47 2015 UTC,You used the wrong conference dummy
CFB,3e2h8a,AlwaysChildish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:16 2015 UTC,I was specifically talking about how Louisville got 11 of their wins he counted towards that 22 by playing an AAC schedule and their OOC in 2013. He said last two years. It was a bad comparison to treat an AAC schedule the same as an SEC one.
CFB,3e2h8a,HissingNewt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"Something Something SEC poll bias ;)  Seriously I'm done with this pissing match, just accept that we're getting really close to the SEC (but not there yet) and call it a day."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"Tech, definitely. They just beat the 2 of the top 5 SEC teams at the end of last season"
CFB,3e2h8a,JELLY__FISTER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:51 2015 UTC,Last year we went 2-0 vs UGA and MSU who I would consider in the top third of SEC teams. Auburn lost to both those teams.  Obviously the question now is when do we get a GT v Auburn series??
CFB,3e2h8a,yogiebere,0,Tue Jul 21 17:14:32 2015 UTC,Probaby GT as the 3rd best team
CFB,3e2h8a,Ndlaxfan,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"We lack 10 win depth that the SEC-West seems to have had the last few years, but we have a ton of quality 7-8 win depth. GT, VT, Duke, NCST, Miami, Pitt are all nothing to scoff at.  Seriously, why does everyone discount Duke? Is it the name? At some point folks need to recognize that Duke has won more football games the last 2 years than LSU, Texas A&M, UGA, and Ole Miss - all of which are teams that would be referred to when talking about SEC depth."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,9,Tue Jul 21 16:28:29 2015 UTC,I will say the acc is the most underrated conference in the whole country.
CFB,3e2h8a,i_fap_to_anything,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"I've been saying that since 2013, when we won the national title and our other BCS bowl game. Was genuinely surprised we went right back to underrated in 2014 after that kind of year."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:27 2015 UTC,2013 was the year y'all ass raped OSU right?
CFB,3e2h8a,i_fap_to_anything,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"We didn't ass rape them - it was really close. But we did beat them. Great team, though. They were 1 conference title game loss against MSU away from going to the national title over Auburn."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,8,Tue Jul 21 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think the ACC is better than the SEC top to bottom. Right now, it has been Florida State and either Clemson/GT carrying the conference most years. Whereas the SEC has twice as many legit contenders through most of the season most years.    What I also don't like is how the ACC has a very poor BCS record. However, the BCS is over and there's a new era, and I'd say that in this (very short) era thus far, the ACC has pulled up closer to the SEC. After all, they produced a title-winning team in this era and the SEC has not."
CFB,3e2h8a,SEC_North,7,Tue Jul 21 14:04:08 2015 UTC,"title winning team this era   If by era you mean playoffs, no, they haven't either."
CFB,3e2h8a,Yesh,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"I consider FSU's title year to be a transitory year. The playoffs were guaranteed at that point, and the format was set up. It was also fitting that FSU had to defeat the SEC champ to win the title in the final BCS year. In a way, that signaled the end of the SEC's stranglehold at the top.     Edit: It's an opinion, guys, not a fact. That doesn't make it off-topic or non-contributing."
CFB,3e2h8a,SEC_North,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works like that lol, There has only been 1 year in the new era... FSU won the last championship of the last era. If we don't stick to the clear delineation between eras we descend into anarchy... is that what you want?"
CFB,3e2h8a,FIVE-ONE-THREE,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:03 2015 UTC,But...it was a BCS title game. Not a playoff.  http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/004/592/my-brain-is-full-of-fuck.jpg
CFB,3e2h8a,Yesh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"What I also don't like is how the ACC has a very poor BCS record.   Like 2013 when we won the national title and went 2-0 in BCS bowl games, whereas the SEC went 0-2? I guess you could make the argument if you go way back, but everyone knows CFB changes so fast that you can't really compare that far back and have the data be relevant to today."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Cherry-picking one single year out of 16 shouldn't give you much confidence in your counter-argument. And to be fair, you seem to have completely ignored my second paragraph.     Prior to 2013, the ACC had something like a 3-13 BCS record. The percentage alone is horrendous, but the fact that the conference often didn't send a 2nd team to the BCS makes it that much worse. Ohio State alone went ten times, with a 6-4 record."
CFB,3e2h8a,SEC_North,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"Prior to 2013, the ACC had something like a 3-13 BCS record.   My entire point was that it's completely irrelevant to 2015. CFB changes so fast."
CFB,3e2h8a,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"This is key. The top of the ACC has demonstrated they can hold their own with any other P5 conference, but there's a quick dropoff. Added to how good they are, the rear of the ACC trails the P5 (and even some of the G5) in attendance and revenue. They definitely have an upward trend but top to bottom I'd still put them fifth among the P5."
CFB,3e2h8a,bakonydraco,12,Tue Jul 21 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with ACC being better than SEC, but the conference is definitely getting better. The head-to-head record against the SEC is 9-10 the past two years so it's not like ACC teams are getting blown out the water when they match up against them."
CFB,3e2h8a,crazythrowa,5,Tue Jul 21 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"the conference is definitely getting better   This, I think we can all agree on"
CFB,3e2h8a,dubsdcarson,23,Tue Jul 21 14:32:14 2015 UTC,Lets be honest the SEC is the best conference. However I do believe that the ACC is getting better and will compete to be a top 3 football conference.
CFB,3e2h8a,CarolinafanfromPitt,10,Tue Jul 21 13:36:47 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  The ACC is improving for sure.
CFB,3e2h8a,cmdrcaboose2,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:07 2015 UTC,PAC 12 was last year
CFB,3e2h8a,Dustin65,4,Tue Jul 21 13:49:11 2015 UTC,I think the SEC was better but it was at the very least a 1a and 1b type deal. The PAC12 is very strong in football from a depth standpoint.
CFB,3e2h8a,turkishguy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"Let's just consider a hypothetical. Both confs have 14 teams; let's take the 5th best and 5th worst of each (by 2014 record) and pick who was better.  5th in SEC: Ole Miss (or Auburn/LSU) vs 5th in ACC: Duke (or BC/NC State) 10th in SEC: Florida (or Tenn/SCar/ATM) vs 10th in ACC: Miami (or Pitt/VT)  IMO, can't see Duke beating Ole Miss, but towards the bottom of the conferences it's not as clear."

CFB,3e2h8a,Conglossian,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, fine. Clear top 3. And A&M won 1 big game that year which got them tons of hype when they werent close to the best in the SEC and they still won in the end."

CFB,3e2h8a,KudzuKilla,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"You were the one who said ""It was just two years ago when they nearly beat A&M"", so you're the one who made it about two years ago. The fact that they nearly beat A&M 2 years ago means nothing about them beating Ole Miss now."
CFB,3e2h8a,Deathscythe07,4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"Because I was using it to exemplify that duke isn't horseshit anymore and can compete. You're talking conferences, I'm talking about the improvement of one individual team"
CFB,3e2h8a,leadCactus,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"I could see BC beating those teams (LSU more so than the other two) and I would be pretty confident in Miami against Florida.

CFB,3e2h8a,MerryvilleBrother,6,Tue Jul 21 13:56:18 2015 UTC,"Virginia Tech was overlooked last year, they were a pretty good team. 5 of their 6 losses were by one score and they had three very impressive road victories, plus a decisive bowl win.

CFB,3e2h8a,dubsdcarson,4,Tue Jul 21 14:01:18 2015 UTC,"BC beating Ole Miss, Auburn, or LSU. Their ball control could limit the points Auburn could score. Their defense could limit the inept offense that is LSU. Ole Miss would be the biggest challenge of the three."

CFB,3e2h8a,dubsdcarson,9,Tue Jul 21 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"They beat a 9-4 USC team last year, lost by 3 to FSU and lost by 4 to Clemson. Are you such an SEC homer that you can't acknowledge that a team who beat a 9-4 team (which is exactly what Ole Miss was) and came close to beating a 13-1 team and a 10-3 team has no chance of beating another 9-4 team and two other 8-5 teams?"
CFB,3e2h8a,MerryvilleBrother,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"No. And there's no need to get vitriolic. I just recognize that all three teams mentioned were significantly better than BC last year.   I mean, as happy as it would make me to see BC walk all over Florida, I really, seriously doubt it would have happened."
CFB,3e2h8a,dubsdcarson,9,Tue Jul 21 14:29:44 2015 UTC,Significantly better based on what? LSU's best win was against 9-4 Ole Miss. BC's best win was against 9-4 USC. And why do you keep bringing up Florida? I never said anything about BC and Florida.
CFB,3e2h8a,MerryvilleBrother,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's my bad - I don't know why I was reading Florida instead of Auburn. Classic dawg reading skills.  In any case, a team is not just as good as it's best win. That's not a great qualifier to determine who is better than who. This is an even weaker argument than the transitive property."
CFB,3e2h8a,dubsdcarson,7,Tue Jul 21 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"In any case, a team is not just as good as it's best win.   You're absolutely right. But it shows what their potential is. It shows how good they can play and who they can beat. I know they're capable of beating an 8-5 LSU because they've already beaten a better 9-4 USC team."
CFB,3e2h8a,MerryvilleBrother,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:58 2015 UTC,Boston College? Methinks no.  Actually...hell no.
CFB,3e2h8a,Yesh,5,Tue Jul 21 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"The fact that BC beat USC last year and hung around with Clemson and FSU tells me that yeah, they could beat LSU. Not that they would win every single time, but that they could realistically compete with and possibly beat LSU. By the way, how did LSU do last year against a team with a power run offense and a stout defense? Here's a hint, the final score was 17-0."
CFB,3e2h8a,MerryvilleBrother,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:27 2015 UTC,I'm not going to get tit for tat here and I'm not going to say LSU couldn't lose to BC but the chances of that happening are pretty damned small. The talent gap is as wide as an ocean and BC has been a ~.500 ACC team for years. They are not peers. Same for OM right now and UF most years.
CFB,3e2h8a,Yesh,0,Tue Jul 21 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"I like you.  I'm also, obviously, in your corner. If there is one thing Addazzio is good at it's getting the team to play up to it's competition. We didn't just hang around with Clemson and FSU--we beat ourselves those games. A missed PAT and a dropped pass on the one yard line kept us from beating Clemson and a missed FG and dropped pass in the RZ kept us from beating FSU.  Plus we beat VT, so that makes us transitive property National Champs!"

CFB,3e2h8a,childishdorito12,8,Tue Jul 21 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"I forget which coach said it at SEC media days, but he pretty much nailed it when he said ""any conference champion can compete with our conference champion. But we have 7 or 8 other teams that can compete with theirs."" Or something like that. Basically, at the very top, the SEC is not that much better than everyone else. But as a whole, it is. You can point to the bowls last year all you want, but the SEC faces mismatches pretty much across the board in bowl games. And like it or not, some teams really don't show up for certain bowl games because they just aren't important. Other programs might get hyped to be in the same game. For the record, I do not think that's what happened to Auburn in the Outback bowl."

CFB,3e2h8a,admiralwaffles,7,Tue Jul 21 13:53:24 2015 UTC,"I get it, but at the same time, I think Bowl Mismatches are not discussed enough when considering results. Especially now that the top team from 4 conferences (likely) will be in the playoff, this leaves potential 1v2s, 2v3s, etc, across bowl games. As you look at conferences (besides SEC) the difference between 2 and 3 can sometimes be HUGE. Even the difference between 1 and 2."
CFB,3e2h8a,bchprty,14,Tue Jul 21 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"I was just poking fun at his thesis that the SEC has 7-8 teams that can compete with all P5 conference champions, but then goes on to complain about bowl mismatches.

CFB,3e2h8a,nucleon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:38 2015 UTC,Tottally agree.  Every year we play the team 2 or 3 spots better in tere conference then the sec team.  Aka the second best acc team plays 4th best sec team.  Other than last year we still beat alamost everybody.
CFB,3e2h8a,KudzuKilla,3,Tue Jul 21 14:01:26 2015 UTC,examples:    A&M in 2012 finished third in the West but played the Big 12 co-champion OU  A&M in 2013 finished fourth in the West but played a division champion in the ACC Auburn last year finished third in the West but played a division champion of the Big 10   it happens every year
CFB,3e2h8a,turkishguy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:14 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying but Wisconsin was not the second best team in the B1G last year.
CFB,3e2h8a,bzhbuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:09 2015 UTC,I definitely agree and so did the bowl placement committees. That's why Wisconsin went to the Outback and MSU went to the NY6 Cotton Bowl.   All I'm saying is the bowl match-ups just prove the depth of the SEC is kinda ridiculous. You have teams finishing 3rd or worse in a division playing division champions and sometimes conference champions of other conferences.

CFB,3e2h8a,YoBroFreeBeerForBoY,6,Tue Jul 21 13:45:19 2015 UTC,I think the agreement the B1G and PAC 12 were discussing (matchups at the start of the season) determined that year so that you get top teams against top teams each year would be ideal.
CFB,3e2h8a,bchprty,5,Tue Jul 21 14:00:18 2015 UTC,How great would that have been? Shame a few of the Pac12 presidents got scared off.
CFB,3e2h8a,RegionalBias,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but then they backed out because conferences got too big. Now we're going to play 9 game conference schedules starting '16

I mean, I like the conference the way it is now, but I'd love it with those two schools. I'm ready for Texas to play a team from Ohio every season. And that would be a nice short trip for WVU."
CFB,3e2gq6,Doonesbury,8,Tue Jul 21 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"BYU's main problem is West Virginia.  It's too many schools too far apart. As much as I like West Virginia -- they provide a big state school flagship that the Big 12 desperately needs with passionate fans and are entertaining to play -- I'd rather concentrate on schools in the central and Mountain West time zones.  I'm sure most people disagree because of their smaller populations and fewer resources, but I wouldn't lose any sleep if the ACC or SEC took West Virginia and we added a bunch of teams like BYU, Cinci, Air Force, CSU, Boise, etc. that we have more in common with geographically. Schools with power conference resources can build up over time like South Carolina has under the SEC banner if they commit to spending the time, money, and effort on facilities, upgrades, and getting better."
CFB,3e2gq6,IShouldLiveInPepper,5,Tue Jul 21 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. You're coming at this from a mid-major mindset. You're supposed to lose that when you join a major conference.  That said, I do feel like the Big XII should add Louisiana. I do think we could build them up over time so that they eventually rival LSU. Won't happen, but it should.   We need to do everything possible to keep WVU. I don't give a damn about time zones, especially not the Mountain time zone. There's nothing of value out there, football-wise, except BYU. And we could just put them in a different division than WVU so they wouldn't have to play so often. Despite being so far away from each other, I think they have a lot in common. Both are crazy mountain people."

I believe when y'all say you enjoy and like playing in the Big 12, but would leave the first chance you got for the ACC.  West Virginia is actually one of the more important schools in the Big 12. The Big 12 only has UT, OU, KU, and West Virginia as flagships, which is behind every conference other than the ACC.  But as long as y'all pine for the ACC behind closed doors, instability will  continue in the Big 12 so long as you really desire to move east.    I think the Big 12 made a tremendous mistake by only taking us and West Virginia a few years ago putting y'all out on a geographic island.  They should have fully raided the Big East, also inviting Pitt and Louisville while they had the chance, then maybe Cinci and someone else to eventually get to 14 and catch up to the other P5s.  If the Big 12 ends up dying after GORs expire, that will be seen as one of the bigger mistakes that led to its demise.  Now there are way too few good teams left to take from the G5 conferences."

I'm not too keen on adding another religious school, especially if that not playing sports on Sunday thing turns out to be a real issue.   Opening the door to Florida for the Big12 for recruiting would be nice, Utah not so much.   I'm not sure how the other sports stack up. Basketball obviously tips to BYU, baseball for UCF.

And I disagree that it's a draw in ratings. BYU has way better marketability. Much more history. They're just tougher, prouder, more consistently competitive."
CFB,3e2gq6,Doonesbury,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:22 2015 UTC,"We don't want BYU in the Big12.  TCU shared the MWC with BYU for almost a decade, and while I like really liked their fans, it became obvious after awhile that the school's administration is toxic to any conference they're a part of. They led the charge when the original MWC schools split from the WAC16 (a good thing), but then a few years later they tried to burn down the MWC when they decided to go independent.   I could come up with a liturgy of complaints against BYU, but the bottom line is the whole time we were in the MWC, that school was constantly whining about something and was always trying to get things arranged in a way that benefited them at the expense of everyone else.   BYU would do nothing for Big12 conference stability. They might even try to destabilize it."
CFB,3e2gq6,Frognosticator,0,Tue Jul 21 16:14:43 2015 UTC,The entire struggle of BYU is to get into a major conference. They would be happy in the Big 12 once they got in.

CFB,3e2gq6,holytrolly,5,Tue Jul 21 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"Guys, honestly what do you expect? Do you expect Bob Bowlsby, the commissioner of the Big 12 to walk up there and declare ""The Big 12 must expand or die!""? The fact is, the Big 12 will eventually expand out of necessity because of television contracts. If Bowlsby is smart, and I’m assuming he is, he’ll wait for new contract negotiations to try and pry good schools away from established conferences (I’m looking at you Nebraska, Missouri, FSU, and/or Clemson). The Big 12 was built from combining the Big 8 (which was an excellent conference) and remnants of the SWC (extremely competitive and fun, if morally bankrupt, conference). Before the conference nearly broke up (I still hate you Dan Bebe) it was vying with the SEC as the best conference, top-to-bottom, in the country.  If the Big 12 wants to regain its prestige it can’t just grab schools because they’re available; it has to be able to entice great schools into joining the conference."
CFB,3e2gq6,Mufasas_Baby,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:28 2015 UTC,I agree. The Big 12 runs the risk of brand dilution depending on which schools they pick. Problem is the Big 12 is the least attractive of all the P5s to go to right now.

CFB,3e2gq6,popmurtha,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely think that it would be for the best to expand. I personally would want to see the Big XII start to sneak in and take teams like La Tech, UCF, USF, and Cincy and REALLY annoy the SEC/B1G.  Who let you into our territory?!? Uh these guys... If you think about it those teams could cause a lot of problems siphoning talent away with more money.  You would get to recruit Louisiana, Ohio and Florida which are all talent rich."

They were going to be down to 8 teams if they didn't act, so they snagged TCU, a geographically sound fit in a great market with a great team and fanbase. This brings us up to 9 (don't hold me to that, I did go to Boise state and our academics are shit tier). Next, they were 50/50 on Louisville or West Virginia. My question is... why not both?   This would have brought them up to 11 teams and secured a travel partner for West Virginia. The 12th team could have been Cincinnati, Memphis, UCF, etc. I feel like adding one more team is a heck of a lot easier to do than adding two, but it's all moot at this point."

CFB,3e2gq6,XCalibur672,10,Tue Jul 21 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"I do think its a bit premature to be making huge decisions off of one year's results. The big 12 was just a couple plays away from having 2 teams in the playoff, and in many years a championship could cost the big 12 a contender that was otherwise a lock.  The bigger issue, imo, is that there is very little big 12 connected representation on the committee. Everyone has their one main rep (we had a guy with one foot out the door) but of the others there is almost no big 12 connection."

It also hurts from the standpoint of our teams going out and playing a nonconference game against respectable opponents, winning those games helps the entire conference by showing how good we are and shapes public perception of our conference, something the BIG12 needs bc the perception as is isn't were it needs to be."
CFB,3e2gq6,MrClaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah but just the other year we had like 7 Big 12 teams bowl eligible. I get the 5 extra losses, but it's not that damaging in my opinion.

Let's say there's a year where we have five undefeated P5 conference champions. That would mean an undefeated team does not get the opportunity to play for the national championship. While unlikely, it is a possibility.   In the long term, I think the Big 12 will break apart and we'll have four major conferences at 16 teams. Then a four team playoff can involve giving each conference champion an automatic bid. The G5s get screwed in this scenario, but I don't see a G5 ever getting ranked to the top 4 due to strength of schedule. They'd have to play an OOC schedule from hell like Bama, Ohio State, and Oregon for that to happen."

CFB,3e35i4,topher3003,43,Tue Jul 21 19:22:18 2015 UTC,Everyone would be excited for the first few seasons but a lot of fanbases would get very unhappy very quickly once everyone realizes that most of these teams would end up losing a lot more games than they're used to.
CFB,3e35i4,pinwheelpride,9,Tue Jul 21 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yup. Like the NFL, there would be a lot more parity and the winner of the league, assuming they played at least 8 games in conference (and potentially one or two against an Oregon, ASU, UCLA, etc OOC), would have 2-3 losses minimum most years.  As an aside, only ONE Pac-12 school but four from the Big Ten? And seven from the SEC? C'mon now."
CFB,3e35i4,anshr01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, picking the teams can be subjective but in a way these are indeed the top 16 all time teams. Look at http://www.winsipedia.com/ranking , they agree almost 100%. The OP's teams are #s 1-15, and #17 in the Winsipedia ranking"
CFB,3e35i4,pinwheelpride,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely one way to do it.

CFB,3e35i4,edisonlbm,4,Tue Jul 21 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the conference champion of this league would be the national champion the vast majority of the time, even if there was still a playoff with other schools involved.  I'd have no problem with losing more if it meant good football and didn't cause everyone to beat each other up and remove themselves from the national championship picture."
CFB,3e35i4,ExternalTangents,21,Tue Jul 21 18:06:45 2015 UTC,USC's travel costs would be ridiculous.

Seriously it was hard to watch this last decade). DFW is notorious for its large market and thus bandwagon fans. Its the same shit people say about Texas or Ohio State fans, but I just was having fun jabbing at those guys in southern Oklahoma."
CFB,3e35i4,FormerlyProductive,7,Tue Jul 21 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"I really feel like that's a regional thing. If you're a Longhorn fan from Dallas/North Texas area then the OU rivalry is bigger. If you're from Houston/East Texas area then the TAMU rivalry is bigger. At least that's how it seems to me. I'm from Houston and always thought of TAMU as enemy number 1 and same with all my other Longhorn friends from Houston growing up. When I actually got to school in Austin, all of my Dallas area friends that I met there considered OU enemy number 1. However, that's just my little anecdote on the TAMU/OU bigger rivalry dilemma.   Edit: spelling n stuf"
CFB,3e35i4,_edd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. For DFWers, OU and A&M are roughly the same distance away. For Houstonians, OU is about 6 hours away and A&M is  a little over an hour. And naturally Aggies are likely to live and work in Houston and Sooners in DFW.   It wasn't until I got to UT that there was even a lot of Sooner hate around me. To add on to that, most of the students (outside of greek life) don't make it to the Red River Shootout, so that rivalry is kind of nerfed to those on campus."

CFB,3e35i4,SamDouglass,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:54 2015 UTC,I think you're going to eventually see something like this happen as players get paid more and more. The wealthiest schools (mostly listed in the title) separate into a football only league set up similarly to the NFL. In this league players are paid and less (if any) ncaa oversight.   Every other team would reform and keep on trucking as they do now except the money involved in programs (like coaching salaries) would go waaay down. Some schools would probably close down a lot of athletic teams due to less revenue.
CFB,3e35i4,Drunken_Wanderer,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. Yes, the allure of the money is strong but the decisions are still being made by university presidents, not athletics directors.

There is a metric fuckton of racism and sexism in those institutions.  It would shock some people.  I pledged (and left after this incident) and we were screamed at for bringing a N***er to our party.  We just liked the guy and thought he'd have fun.

CFB,3e36yc,uncomfortablyhigh,4,Tue Jul 21 18:21:12 2015 UTC,i think your fans are diehards. The fact ISU has the 3rd largest stadium in the league is probably not a good indicator of league health just based on your programs history.

It's a lot harder to keep your inner asshole quiet when you're getting your butt kicked for years and years (which might explain a little bit of my school's less-than-favorable reputation.)

I went off on a Baylor fan and it was a dickhead thing to do. Who knew it wouldn't be an Aggie to finally break me out of my permastoned place of constant zen...  Anyway. Yesterday on LHN one of our old players (Ahmad Brooks) was talking about how shitty we were at all of our skill positions this year and it super bummed me out.

CFB,3e36yc,TheGamerExchange,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:54 2015 UTC,At ECU he gave their back about 30 touches a game and lots of short screens and their RB depth wasn't anything special. I'm sure Riley will at least make it 60/40 pass/run. Not conventional air raid but I'm optimistic.

CFB,3e36yc,uncomfortablyhigh,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"O-line looks good this year. Last year we had 6 rotating players (six!) for half the year, who had a combined start number of THREE or something before the year began.  This year that number is now in the 40's and we're three deep at every position. We won't be Arkansas or Wisconsin or anything but everyone is D1-sized and not suspended or injured, so I'm expecting an improvement."

The restaurant is open, the wait in line is no more than 20min... and the food is better than ever with a proper kitchen.    What I DO mind is when they are known throughout the Country for good BBQ and refuse to grow to accommodate demand because... fuck you wait in line.

CFB,3e32wd,amarner32,21,Tue Jul 21 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I think Paterno's legacy is a bigger controversy than Sandusky ever was. Sandusky is a scumbag, almost everyone accepts this, but the lasting memory of Paterno is a much more hotly debated topic."
CFB,3e32wd,SurpriseSalami,13,Tue Jul 21 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I just watched the documentary ""Happy Valley"" on Netflix and it was gut-wrenching. On the top level, Sandusky was vile. No way around that, the fact that it happened on campus and in football facilities was horrendous. Beyond that, with Paterno's role-- he didn't do enough. With the level he held the program to and the standard he demanded from students and those around them, it was not enough to simply follow protocol. He had an obligation from the original mandate he laid out with ""winning with character"". That being said, I don't feel he was malicious or intentional or villainous in any of his actions (I could be wrong, but we'll never know without a doubt)-- I think Joe was an old naive man who doubted this could have ever happened. There's a line in the movie from one of the Paterno sons (Jay, I belive) that talks about how they didn't know a serial rapist/pedophile could be so inconspicuous-- I think that naivety was echoed from his upbringing. I think that became the issue and I think it led to the tragic events continuing for longer than they would have otherwise.  Overall, it's a complex event (not so much as it's hard to decipher the blame as it is in that it's one that brought about so many peripheral emotions on top of the sadness and disbelief). For the record, I'm not in favor of the statue returning to Beaver Stadium-- Joe didn't even like the statue to begin with. I do, however, still hold Joe in high regard (with a  large blemish on the end of an incredible life). The documentary did a good job in reminding the audience (particularly those, like me, who will always have some level of respect and honor  for Joe) that there are fans who won't handle things properly and will be way over the line (as seen in the riots as well as some interviews). And the one highlighted in the film makes my head spin with how close-minded and ignorant he was in his statements.   It's okay for a legacy to be tainted and for you to still honor and respect someone's life and accomplishments. It's okay for you to have complex emotions about your team and how it's been run, especially when they're as big a part of your life as it is for many PSU fans and for many of us on /r/CFB. However, it's not okay to turn a blind eye, and it's not okay to just do the right thing when you have a chance (with prestige and influence) to do so much more."
CFB,3e32wd,elgambino,4,Tue Jul 21 16:54:34 2015 UTC,Even some of the biggest people circlejerk'd on reddit for being amazing did horrible things. I think Paterno just let his friendship blind him. If it was someone he didn't know it would have been a different story.
CFB,3e32wd,iopper,9,Tue Jul 21 17:23:21 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say friendship. It was pretty widely known in State College that Paterno disliked Sandusky.

I'm just Paterno believed that Sandusky didn't do anything, it's hard to imagine something like that happening so close to home. However, it didn't impede him from going to the authorities."
CFB,3e32wd,Sh-tstirrer,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"I just watched this documentary the other day and it's probably one of the best ""sports"" documentaries I've ever seen.

Really excellent stuff all the way through."

CFB,3e32wd,I_Miss_Austin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, the idea of punishment was inherently justified because everyone knew that they were cheating.

Oh well, here goes. (quick note: I'm pretty sure I know the answers to many of these but I'd like to hear how a player on the spot would answer).   Taylor Doyle: How does training/development under Wickline differ from the prior regime? Has there been significant buy-in by the players that have remained? Did his approach play a role in any of the transfers?   Duke Thomas: With Diggs graduating, do you believe you can fill the role of vocal leader in the secondary? How are the young (secondary) guys developing and who among them do you believe will have an impact this year?   Johnathan Gray: Physically, how much better do you feel this summer compared to last summer? How has your approach to training/preparation changed now that you are going be the work horse in the back field?   Coach Strong: how has the atmosphere changed in the locker room since last year (polite way to ask - one year later, has the purge had the effect you wanted)? Who is stepping up as a leader in the locker room with Brown and Diggs gone? Who is a player that is not getting much attention you believe could have a break out year?"

CFB,3e2hbv,riotide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:12 2015 UTC,Well QB was a problem for awhile. They had Jacory Harris and then Stephen Morris both of those guys were okay but really inconsistent.  Kaaya is the first in awhile that out the gate seems to have a really solid hold on what they are trying to do offensively and is executing it consistently.  They still need a defense/o-line but QB for now has been solved.

Not bad, but not elite by any measure either.   2015: 26  2014: 12  2013: 20  2012: 9  2011: 36  2010: 16  2009: 15"

Miami's reputation isn't horrid. But I'd feel pretty comfortable saying the view of the program as a whole us turning more and more negative. Mediocre coaching, limited fan/booster/school support, mediocre product on the field for quite some time now. It's definitely taking it's toll."

We've had some games where we win on the road and the teams finished just right outside of ranked (they were ranked at the time of the win like Oklahoma in 2014). Someone broke down the stat and we've had very few road ranked match ups. Last year, we didn't play any ranked teams on the road.

You don't get many high ranked matchups throughout a season, and what most people were predicting OU to be much better than they were. The one area to improve, would be trying to make the OOC reflect a ranked matchup.

Did he not pay any attention to football outside of the Big10 last year? Having a winning record in the Pac12 South was no small accomplishment. It's not like we were a top 25 team last year and probably will be entering the season opener this year. But no it's super embarrassing to lose to us lol
CFB,3e2v9j,hythloday1,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"I also found the article weird to read from that perspective (though I wouldn't call it a joke, I think the analysis of the scheme is sound) - as though Michigan had superior talent to Utah and just couldn't put it together because of bad coaching.  And maybe that'd be a reasonable stance going into the 2014 game, when Utah was coming off a 5-7 season the year before and not a lot of people had eyeballs on them.  But anyone who actually watched Utah in 2014 knows that it's a very talented, very physical team which easily was a match for, if not superior to, Michigan's personnel.  I'm a little less sanguine about Utah in 2015, simply because I think Blechen, Orchard, and Sitake might be irreplaceable, but the tone of this article makes very little sense knowing what the Utes are capable of."
CFB,3e2v9j,Krakenborn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. The author was very informed on the schematics of the Utah-Michigan game last year but not so on Utah's prominence as a whole which leads me to believe they spend nearly all their time analyzing Michigan/Big10 and not much else. Which is somewhat expected of a beat writer but it leads to myopic opinions like most of the first paragraph of the article.
CFB,3e2v9j,LarpMaster2000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:30 2015 UTC,I mean ever if he only paid attention to Big 10 football it wouldn't be a surprise considering you shellacked us 26-10 at the Big House last year.
CFB,3e2v9j,CambodianDrywall,7,Tue Jul 21 18:32:31 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that they were opening the season with back-to-back games with the Pac12.  Nice.

CFB,3e2v9j,dubsdcarson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:11 2015 UTC,Excellent preview. One thing that I think works in Michigan's favor is that the Utah coaches have no film to watch of the new Michigan scheme. They'd have to watch Stanford and 49ers film and extrapolate that to the current roster.

CFB,3e2v9j,nickknx865,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting breakdown.  I guess the good news for Michigan is that they return everyone from the OL last year, so they've gotten another year of S&C work under their belt, which is probably more important for offensive lineman than it is for anyone else. You'd also like to think that if there's a coach that will put emphasis on blocking techniques and be able to improve them quickly, it'd be Harbaugh and his staff."
CFB,3e2v9j,Jadaki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:29 2015 UTC,My biggest dilemma though - is it a good thing or bad thing to have the entire O-line returning when our offense was one of the worst in the entire country?

CFB,3e2v9j,orobs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly confident in our defense.  We had a really good unit, despite the excessive amount of bad situations the turnovers on offense put us in.  Just cutting down on turnovers and letting the defense rest will be a huge improvement this year.  Hopefully we get to see Peppers all year.   Utah's secondary looks to be as full of question marks as our passing game is.  So that will be the interesting match-up I'll keep an eye on.   Hopefully the return of Darboh will be accompanied by someone who can get him the ball downfield.  If we can create steady running lanes on early downs to keep from 3rd and long situations I think the game is winnable."

CFB,3e2v9j,LarpMaster2000,15,Tue Jul 21 15:25:54 2015 UTC,Eh. It's more our offense that will be the problem. We were a top 15 rush defense last year and barely lost anyone. Booker had his worst game of the year against us last year with only 34 yards
CFB,3e2v9j,I_Lie_Everytime,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:25 2015 UTC,And then Booker got a lot more practice playing some pretty good pac12 defenses.
CFB,3e2v9j,fisticuffs32,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:44 2015 UTC,I think the point is more that our rush defense is the strength of the team. It's what we are going to be relying on if we are going to have any success.
CFB,3e2v9j,uppercuticus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:46 2015 UTC,Its also nice that Greg Mattison stayed on staff as the DL coach. That can only help the transition into a new defensive coordinator and head coach

I feel that a few fans (myself included) are a bit antsy to see how we're going to get our 20+ commits into 14 currently open scholarship spots for next year. Performance-wise, he's definitely playing with house money this year, but depending on how we do this year he start feeling the pressure for results in year two"
CFB,3e2v9j,LarpMaster2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"I have a slight worry about having a Rich Rod type circumstance where the coach disappoints and the fans get impatient leading to another 3 and out.  Year 1: The team doesn't really improve and goes 6-6. Harbaugh gets a free pass because it's year one.  Year 2: The team doesn't improve much again and goes 7-5 but Harbaugh is still getting his players in so people don't get upset too upset but are a little anxious.  Year 3: People usually demand improvement in year 3 but our schedule is brutal and this could lead to disaster. Our schedule includes Florida (Neutral Site), Cincinnati, Michigan State, @Penn State, Minnesota, @Wisconsin, Ohio State. Those are 7 tough games. I could see Michigan going 7-5 or 8-4 again there and people getting upset. It could turn into a situation where impatient fans start grumbling and the administration and Harbaugh start butting heads and he decides he doesn't need that and leaves for the NFL."

CFB,3dz424,ravindra69,15,Mon Jul 20 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Karras was a tremendous player. Another great tackle that year was  senior tackle Lou Michaels, who won the 1957 Knute Rockne Trophy, placed 4th in Heisman voting, and had a 14-year NFL career. There's a very good excerpt of Karras' biography in USA Today's CFB Encyclopedia:     The first time Alex Karras spoke in front of a network television camera in 1957 he was a mumbling, nervous recipient of the Outland Trophy as the nation's top lineman. Jack Lescoulie of NBC's Today Show prompted the young tackle to say ""some very corny things""--as Karras described in his biography, Even Big Guys Cry--such as ""Without the big guys up front the little guys can't do it...""  It was hardly Karras' last appearance before a TV camera.  After an All-Pro career as a cat-quick defensive tackle for the Detroit Lions, Karras replaced Emmy Award winner Don Meredith on the ABC Monday Night Football telecasts with Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell.  Although the beloved Meredith proved a tough act to follow, Karras injected his own colorful persona into the threesome in the broadcast booth.  Karras added a sense of the bizarre; what was probably his best line captioned a sideline close-up of the steaming, shaved head of a big Oakland Raider: ""That's Otis Sistrunk, Raiders defensive tackle...out of the University of Mars.""  Karras' broadcast performances triggered several movie opportunities and he appeared in tremendously diverse roles in such films as ""Paper Lion,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Victor Victoria.""  Karras played himself in ""Paper Lion"" and the trail hand Mongo in Mel Brooks' novel comedy, ""Blazing Saddles,"" in which he stole the show in a legendary, hysterical gas-passing campfire scene.  His character opened ""Victor Victor"" as a macho bodyguard and ended it sleeping with a gay cabaret performer played by Robert Preston. Karras also starred as the adoptive father of little Emmanuel Lewis in the TV series ""Webster.""    His actress wife Susan Clark became his co-star on several occasions, including the couple's wonderful portrayals of sports great Babe Didrickson Zaharias and her wrestler husband George."

CFB,3e1q8j,nuxenolith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"9 is pushing it?  Last year with an average coaching staff we should have beat Minnesota, Rutgers, and Maryland.  That would've put us at 8 wins.  This year the team has matured a bit, and I think the coaching staff is a big upgrade.  I wouldn't say 9 is pushing it.  I don't expect us to beat UTAH, MICHIGAN STATE, PENN STATE, or OHIO STATE.  But I think it's likely that we take at least one of those games."
CFB,3e1q8j,NewToRedditBrewing,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, 9 is pushing it.  Last year, you lost to Minnesota, Rutgers, and Maryland; plus, Minnesota was a blowout.  Expecting your brand-new coaching staff to immediately get 120% results out of players who've spent the last 4 years learning an old offensive scheme is unrealistic.  I can see you losing 7 games on your schedule: Utah, OSU, BYU, MSU, Minny, PSU, and tOSU.  I highly highly doubt you'll win 4 of those."

CFB,3e1q8j,Emcee_squared,14,Tue Jul 21 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"between 7-9 is reasonable.  The defense has been asked to do it all since Mattison came on board and really was pretty good considering the terrible spots the offense put them in.  It all hinges on how the offense improves.  QB, Oline, RBs and receivers all seem like big question marks.  I think we have the right coaching staff in place to fix these deficiencies though.  Just maybe not immediately."
CFB,3e1q8j,kylegoblue,3,Tue Jul 21 11:58:10 2015 UTC,With Jake Ruddock transfering in and the offensive line being a year older (excluding the departed Miller) I think 7-9 is reasonable.  If we win more than that a lot of balls will have to bounce our way.
CFB,3e1q8j,NewToRedditBrewing,2,Tue Jul 21 12:51:45 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Ruddock + protection seems to be the key.  I'll be surprised if any of the other QBs get the nod ahead of him.  He sounds like he is consistent and doesn't turn the ball over.  Turnovers have been a huge problem over the last 7 years or so.  If we can squeeze out an 10th win (maybe an upset over a rival) I would be ecstatic.
CFB,3e1q8j,kylegoblue,6,Tue Jul 21 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe I have too much respect for Harbaugh, but I could see them starting off 5-2 through the first 7 games. I see Michigan finishing up with a solid 8-9 wins."

CFB,3e1q8j,IdealParadox,5,Tue Jul 21 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"I think they will manage 7-8 wins, but the more important part is the team, as a whole, will actually look like a competent football team."
CFB,3e1q8j,BrutalSaint,9,Tue Jul 21 14:36:05 2015 UTC,8-4.  They'll be legit playoff contenders in ~1-2 years.  That was gross that I had to say that.
CFB,3e1q8j,bigcontracts,17,Tue Jul 21 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"Surprising number of 1-6ers in there.  Michigan has talent, guys. Hoke recruited well. They just didn't have the right people to develop that talent.   In one year, 10+ wins would be a ridiculous turnaround. That's Maize-colored glasses territory. But if Michigan can move the needle into the 'competent' range, especially on offense, this team should win 7-9."
CFB,3e1q8j,FluidHips,8,Tue Jul 21 09:34:57 2015 UTC,"I think what it is, is that people expect them to lose to Utah, BYU, Michigan State, Minnesota, Penn State, and Ohio State. Add to that a random upset loss and youre down to 5 wins... Of course this is all worst case scenario, but probably where people's heads are at when picking 1-6"
CFB,3e1q8j,FIVE-ONE-THREE,5,Tue Jul 21 12:32:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's much more reasonable than I suspected.  I agree those are tougher teams, but getting blanked by the slate strikes me as only slightly more likely than going 10+. I think we take care of BYU, Minny, and PSU this year. And I have a very good feeling about Utah, given their recent secondary issues (legal trouble), which should offset Michigan's unknowns in the passing game. State and the Buckeyes are late enough in the year to maybe give us a puncher's chance."
CFB,3e1q8j,FluidHips,6,Tue Jul 21 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"Right, like I said that's definitely worst case scenario... I didn't choose that option, just wanted to come up with a sensible reason for anyone who might have chosen 1-6 ... Of course you also have to factor in Ohio State, MSU, and ND fans choosing 1-6 because they hate Michigan"
CFB,3e1q8j,FIVE-ONE-THREE,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Hang on there buddy. I would never let my hatred of Michigan let me pick 1-6. I went with the perfectly logical and reasonable option of not voting due to a lack of a ""0 wins"" option.   ...Just kidding, I think between 6-8 wins, and thus went with the option that had 7."
CFB,3e1q8j,callouspenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, the options should have been 1-5, 6-8, 9-10, 11+"

CFB,3e1q8j,FluidHips,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:54 2015 UTC,You aren't beating us in a Whiteout. We bring back a lot more this year than last year and it looks like our oline will be much improved. I don't see it.
CFB,3e1q8j,Scrantonbornboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"I remember going through the O-line woes, and I think it's really hard for a team to go from terrible to even average by the end of the year.

CFB,3e1q8j,FluidHips,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that is fair enough. Those will all be tough games to win. However, they are all winnable games. Half of those games are rivalry games. Utah is opening night in which anything can happen. Just ask us about App. State. BYU was incredibly streaky last year and the game is at the Big House although Hill scares the crap out of me. Michigan State is Harbaugh's first rivalry game at the Big House which should serve as a boost but I don't see us winning that one. Oddly enough, we seem to own Minnesota. We have only lost to them twice in my lifetime so I never count Michigan out although we should be big underdogs considering how last year went.  Last time we played a night game at Penn State, it went to 4OT and we lost.  That is a winnable game but extremely tough. And Hoke always played OSU down to the wire so who knows about Harbaugh. The optimistic fan in me has us at 8-4, but I'm starting to lean more towards 7-5."

That was also a pretty damn cupcake schedule, with one of the best QBs ever in the history of CFB.   But never loose those rose glasses."
CFB,3e1q8j,Against-The-Grain,0,Tue Jul 21 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"So he had a slow start taking over a chronically bad 1-11 team devoid of talent and that means he might not be an upgrade over one of the most incompetent coaches I've ever seen? That somehow the team will be worse with Harbaugh at the helm?  k  Never mind that our defense, which was already excellent, will be essentially unchanged."
CFB,3e1q8j,Shaqsquatch,0,Tue Jul 21 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Lol.  Take a chill pill.  Its just my opinion you have 4 wins on your schedule and in his first year I don't know that expecting 7 wins is reasonable.  I hate to tell you this but Michigan is a team in decline.  They haven't beat a ranked team in god knows how long.  But maybe Jimmy can take his magic wand, wave it, and poof your team will win 9 games."
CFB,3e1q8j,Against-The-Grain,0,Tue Jul 21 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think 8 is our ceiling and 6 is our floor, but to think that going from Hoke to Harbaugh is somehow a downgrade means you're either trolling or have no idea what you're talking about.   They haven't beat a ranked team in god knows how long.   And this really makes me think it's the latter.  They didn't beat a ranked team in 2014 and that's it. They beat ranked ND in 2013, ranked NW in 2012, and ranked Nebraska and VT in 2011.  Never mind the top recruiting classes Hoke was still pulling in. Michigan's problem was Hoke's inability to develop players, the roster is still plenty talented."
CFB,3e1q8j,Shaqsquatch,0,Tue Jul 21 17:18:05 2015 UTC,okay bubby  So almost 2 years ago you beat what ended up as the #25 team.
CFB,3e1q8j,Against-The-Grain,0,Tue Jul 21 17:23:03 2015 UTC,There are a lot of very valid reasons why Michigan could really struggle this year (many of which have been mentioned in this thread).  But this one seems like a real stretch.  I'd be curious on why you think Harbaugh may not be an upgrade over Hoke?
CFB,3e1q8j,Terrabon98,0,Tue Jul 21 17:07:42 2015 UTC,I 100% agree harbaugh will be better than Hoke.  I just am not sure it will be this year.
CFB,3e1q8j,Against-The-Grain,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:16 2015 UTC,7 to 9 wins.  For all the chaos Michigan still has the talent to just beat most of those teams with a talent advantage alone.   Motivate those guys and get them even slightly organized and they're fine.  To some extent it depends on how much Jim wants to shake things up or go slowly.
CFB,3e1q8j,CantaloupeCamper,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"Our defense will be great, that much is known. If we somehow develop a competent QB with a good OL and a RB that can do more than just run down the middle, we might have a shot at more than 7 wins. I also expect at least 2 games of surprises, meaning there will be 2 games we are supposed to lose and we play it to a win or keep it extremely close."
CFB,3e1q8j,finchdog,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"These are the stats for Bob Stoops at OU, Nick Saban at Alabama, and Pete Carroll at USC.   First Year combined record: 20-17.

And then when we finally got on we sat there for another 20 minutes as the door in our car wouldn't close.  Someone came and literally kicked the side panel until the door worked.
CFB,3dy0ai,LOLmodel,9,Mon Jul 20 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Marta is getting better at handing large events. It used to be when we had a Thursday night game the North Ave station would be overflowing with people waiting the standard 15min for a train. I went to the Rolling Stones concert at Bobby Dodd last month and they had extra trains already in the station when the show was over. You could say we are just now getting to ""common sense"" level of capacity management, but that is a huge step for Marta."
CFB,3dy0ai,10per,11,Mon Jul 20 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"You could say we are just now getting to ""common sense"" level of capacity management, but that is a huge step for Marta.   Keith Motherfucking Parker"
CFB,3dy0ai,ArchEast,9,Mon Jul 20 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"Marta has actually gotten way better, like significant improvement since the new CEO took over in 2012/early 2013. Marta is actually taken serious now and can (usually) be relied on. Keith Parker has been really good at fixing the problems and now they are looking to secure funding to take it to a new level. It's a really exciting time to live in Atlanta right now."
CFB,3dy0ai,CDub22EP,3,Mon Jul 20 16:29:06 2015 UTC,Does Cobb still plan on excluding Marta or did they come around with the new stadium in the works?
CFB,3dy0ai,MonteAlban,11,Mon Jul 20 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"No, they still pull the racist ""we dont want those kind in our county"". There has been talks of connecting the shuttle thing that will be around Suntrust Park to a Marta route but I seriously doubt that will happen. Until all the old white officials die off/get replaced Cobb will still say no to Marta. Which is fucking ridiculous because they are only making their traffic problems worse."
CFB,3dy0ai,CDub22EP,18,Mon Jul 20 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if they let MARTA expand then they will literally have gangbangers coming into their gated neighborhoods stealing their TVs.  And then carrying a 70"" TV back to their hood on MARTA.  Because that is how public transportation works."

It has all the makings of a great series, but it's hard for any kind of relationship to grow when we hardly play each other.  It would be really cool if this past year was the start of something, yeah going up against UGA will always be uphill but consistently doing well can start to change how uphill it is."

CFB,3dz0oz,YellsAtWalls,36,Mon Jul 20 18:39:12 2015 UTC,top form   See also: drunk
CFB,3dz0oz,vampfredthefrog,21,Mon Jul 20 20:18:43 2015 UTC,Current student here.  Can confirm: will be drunk from Friday til the conclusion of this game.
CFB,3dz0oz,YellsAtWalls,7,Mon Jul 20 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"That's like, automatic sobriety isn't it?"
CFB,3dz0oz,nuckeyebut,9,Mon Jul 20 21:22:28 2015 UTC,No it's more of a lifelong commitment.  Because the hangover from that might kill me
CFB,3dz0oz,Rakzul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:53 2015 UTC,probably going to need to go longer... just saying
CFB,3dz0oz,happyflappypancakes,5,Tue Jul 21 14:58:21 2015 UTC,The trusty hike clap will guide us to victory.
CFB,3dz0oz,JohnnyChurlish,9,Mon Jul 20 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, do OSU fans think they were ever going to stack Lane? They will have a slight sliver on our East stands, and, if they travel particularly well, will be dispersed among the South Endzone, our worst section. If OSU traveled the best game of their lives they would only get about 5% of the stadium."
CFB,3dz0oz,happyflappypancakes,15,Tue Jul 21 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"We're probably the best travelling fan base in CFB - plus we have alum everywhere. Buckeyes will be flooding in from Charlotte, Richmond, BaltoWash, etc. Combine this with the fact that we’re coming off a National Championship season and the revenge factor and you’ve got the makings of a Buckeye invasion."
CFB,3dz0oz,is_biased,8,Tue Jul 21 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think you understand. This isn't some 100,000+ stadium with seats to spare. This is a cozy 66,000 capacity stadium that will house the surrounding New River Valley Hokie faithful. Not too much room to squeeze in 30-40% OSU fans like I keep hearing will arrive. There will be OSU fans there, but it will not be like what they are used to. You see those gray seats? Those will be OSU fans, season ticket holders won't be selling their seats for this one."
CFB,3dz0oz,Kenya151,7,Tue Jul 21 04:06:18 2015 UTC,Stubhub tells me you are lying.  No shortage of tickets for sale right now.
CFB,3dz0oz,ezpickins,4,Tue Jul 21 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"Dawg we took OVER at Cal like two years ago. Half the stadium was red and it was across the country. There was O-H-I-O chants all over the place. Blacksburg is like 5 hours aways from OSU, that's an easy travel for the game."
CFB,3dz0oz,JohnnyChurlish,8,Tue Jul 21 07:36:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, but it was Cal"
CFB,3dz0oz,ezpickins,2,Tue Jul 21 08:59:45 2015 UTC,Which is on the other side of the country - whereas Blacksburg is a 5 hour drive from Columbus.
CFB,3dz0oz,happyflappypancakes,5,Tue Jul 21 09:13:42 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, Cal is easily accessible and hasn't been too successful in recent history, and I am unsure how fervent they are towards their football team. VT might not be as good as they were a few years back, but they still have a very strong fanbase and while OSU will probably have a ton of people in Blacksburg I don't think they'll all get tickets since this will be such a hyped game"
CFB,3dz0oz,JSOPro,5,Tue Jul 21 09:16:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks you, in terms of fervent fanbase/stadium capacity ratio, VT has to be near the top. I have never seen Lane Stadium ""taken over"" by another team. Doesn't matter how many advantages the away team has over ours, they will never take home field advantage."
CFB,3dz0oz,slass-y,3,Tue Jul 21 11:27:41 2015 UTC,No one said take home field advantage but to think we'll only have a tiny sliver of fans there seems wishful to me.
CFB,3dz0oz,happyflappypancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:30 2015 UTC,when was the last time VT hosted someone akin to Ohio State's status though? Legitimately curious.
CFB,3dz0oz,nexr38,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"As many OSU fans can travel to VT as they want, but I'm telling you it doesn't matter. They will just have to stay by their tailgates because they aren't getting in that stadium. I'm telling you, if their is one thing great about a smaller stadium, it fits less foes."
CFB,3dz0oz,K_multiplied-by_K,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:33 2015 UTC,Lol it was more like 80%
CFB,3dz0oz,is_biased,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:57:03 2015 UTC,Might wanna ask ND who has the best traveling fan base...
CFB,3dz0oz,Geoponics,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:14 2015 UTC,The letters to editor in the South Bend Tribune after that game made me sooooo happy.
CFB,3dz0oz,b1gchampions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:59:06 2015 UTC,No. No reasonable person even considered this. Ignore the crazy
CFB,3dz0oz,scrnlookinsob,2,Tue Jul 21 12:16:54 2015 UTC,So I have a rookie question: I've never been to an away OSU game and I'm definitely trying to go to this one. How do I go about making sure I can get seated in an OSU section?
CFB,3dz0oz,b1gchampions,8,Tue Jul 21 02:24:34 2015 UTC,https://www.vipseats.com/images/lane%20stadium%20seating%20chart.jpg  Try to get a seat in Section 19/39 That's the visitor section for Lane Stadium.
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:44 2015 UTC,Thanks dude....
CFB,3dz0oz,vtgorilla,4,Tue Jul 21 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"Additionally 101/102 is where yalls band will be and that half of the South Endzone is also visitor friendly, and the upper deck of the SEZ is generally the cheapest tickets to be had."
CFB,3dz0oz,anshr01,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:25 2015 UTC,"And the view's really pretty decent from there...birds eye perspective, but you miss out on some of the feel of the atmosphere."
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:06 2015 UTC,Buy your ticket from OSU...
CFB,3dz0oz,elykl33t,19,Tue Jul 21 04:23:42 2015 UTC,Glad they learned. It sucked having classes in 2012 before the game.
CFB,3dz0oz,boothroyd917,7,Mon Jul 20 18:40:04 2015 UTC,Of course it's right after we leave.
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,2,Mon Jul 20 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say 2010 was worse (for me, at least). No one was in class all day before the game, and those that did show up the next day were all depressed as hell. That was a rough one to lose."
CFB,3dz0oz,boothroyd917,3,Tue Jul 21 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"It was my freshman year in the Corps. I was so pumped because we were going for free as a group to the game. So I didnt really understand the significance of the loss at first, and then all the Upperclassmen said it would be ok and that all would be well after our first home game that Saturday.  I believed them..."
CFB,3dz0oz,OSU_Silver_Bullets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:19 2015 UTC,"Oh God, I had done everything in my power to forget that following weekend... That was even worse... I still get shit from JMU fans that like to brag about how they beat us that year, it's so dumb. There was a kid in my dorm that was running around with a JMU shirt on after the game, a bunch of guys ran after him, tackled him, literally ripped the shirt off his back, lit it on fire, threw it in a urinal, then pissed on it. That night was one of the quietest Saturday nights I can remember in Blacksburg..."
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,18,Tue Jul 21 13:33:13 2015 UTC,Good... Good.

CFB,3dz0oz,nuckeyebut,19,Mon Jul 20 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the board of Tech would be happy with cancelling classes just for a football game, especially since we're not even ranked. It so happens the game is also on a national holiday that we really should have off in the first place, so President Sands is using the game as an oppurtunity to push the national holiday as a day off for students.   Doing it on a tuesday doesn't make sense."
CFB,3dz0oz,AGSattack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:03 2015 UTC,plus we didnt even get off fOR THE FUCKING NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!!!
CFB,3dz0oz,HokieinFL28,4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"People probably read this as trash talk (and for all I know you meant it that way) but I agree as a general proposition--More time to relax following a night game, maybe nurse a hangover, etc.  Sunday off is what makes college football so nice for me."
CFB,3dz0oz,AGSattack,10,Mon Jul 20 18:31:37 2015 UTC,IMO Hokie Students were not going to class on Monday & Tuesday..  that place will be absolutely rocking and if ESPN were smart they would find a way to do a little pregame/mini-gameday there.
CFB,3dz0oz,HokieinFL28,4,Mon Jul 20 18:37:06 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  If it's anything like that Miami game a while back Ohio State will be walking into the danger zone in atmospheric terms.
CFB,3dz0oz,Abusoru,5,Mon Jul 20 18:44:34 2015 UTC,that Miami game was one of the loudest last 10-15 seconds ever. Al Golden's face after he took his timeout said it all.
CFB,3dz0oz,Smoregazm,5,Mon Jul 20 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"And remember, the top of the south endzone wasn't really full because it was fall break weekend. There's no excuse for there not being a packed house for this game."
CFB,3dz0oz,Blakmagik12,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"Top of the south endzone is never full, since lottery holders just sit in north. Lane was sold out that night."
CFB,3dz0oz,bcsimms04,7,Mon Jul 20 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"Holy crap I knew ya'll played this year, but I didn't think the rematch was the Monday the weekend the season started.  Way to crush my dreams of going to that game :(."
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,7,Mon Jul 20 19:02:01 2015 UTC,You normally have classes on labor day?  I thought everyone had labor day off.
CFB,3dz0oz,bcsimms04,10,Mon Jul 20 20:09:13 2015 UTC,Hey sone of us are dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge!
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,5,Mon Jul 20 20:33:40 2015 UTC,I just thought it was a requirement for all public schools to be off.

CFB,3dz0oz,ToLongDR,59,Mon Jul 20 18:07:39 2015 UTC,Last time they beat us we won the Natty... You sure you want that?
CFB,3dz0oz,KudzuKilla,35,Mon Jul 20 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"For Auburn, beating Alabama in the Sugar Bowl was probably worth it."
CFB,3dz0oz,nexr38,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:21 2015 UTC,I was really upset that it came of that.  I was hoping y'all would play Oregon and Alabama would play FSU and FSU and Oregon would play each other.
CFB,3dz0oz,StrikerObi,22,Mon Jul 20 18:53:39 2015 UTC,FSU and Oregon did play each other

CFB,3dz0oz,TrustMeImCrazy,15,Mon Jul 20 22:32:33 2015 UTC,Ill take a whole day of nothing but shots from ESPN of  students and alumni enjoying a great holiday and bonding over school spirit. Better than whatever passes for attendance in Cville these days.  Though can we all admit it is really weird that lots of Va schools have classes on Labor day?

CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,16,Mon Jul 20 20:37:26 2015 UTC,Jim Weaver and Charles Steger were nothing but positive influences on the school and your apparent bashing of them is misinformed and in bad taste following Weaver's recent death.

All the while keeping us as one of less than 20 schools to turn a profit? He was a godsend and simply because he wasn't the most personable is a poor reason to condemn him.  But please I would like to hear your reasons for hating Weaver."
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,8,Mon Jul 20 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Weaver deserves all the credit in the world for what he did earlier in his career at VT, but there are legitimate gripes for how things ran towards the end. OOC scheduling, choosing to have noon games, stick it in, dismantling the basketball program, and failing to keep up with the rest of the athletic world. For those of us that got to VT more recently (I'm also entering my 5th year), Whit has been a breath of fresh air."
CFB,3dz0oz,DBHT14,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"Some points.   OOC scheduling?! USC, Boise, Bama,  TAMU, LSU, tOSU, WISC, PSU, WVU, UM, and Bristol game were all sceduled or played under his watch. The only gripe you could say is ""o no we play pne of the best G5 schools a lot!""  And Greenberg did plenty on his own to destroy the program.  When fired he did not have 1, ONE, assistant coach on staff they had all quit.  I am not much older. Graduated in 2014 but if your entire enjoyment of Gameday atmosphere is on a song thst is not good. We dont need it to be a premier atmosphere. As yourself if us having stick it in would have made 2011 Miami thst much more electric. Probably not, it is emotional swings which build atmosphere not a cadence."

CFB,3dzgbu,Drunken_Wanderer,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"They are team specific, but they are employees of and paid by the ACC? Is that correct?"
CFB,3dzgbu,k3ithk,4,Mon Jul 20 22:28:28 2015 UTC,This is the way academic advisors and tutors should be.
CFB,3dzgbu,Toon_Squad18,3,Tue Jul 21 00:43:43 2015 UTC,Can you explain what benefit there is to tutors and academic advisors being paid by the conference? I'm failing to see how this would make sense
CFB,3dzgbu,b_e_e_r,6,Tue Jul 21 02:28:11 2015 UTC,If tutors were paid by the conference (or the NCAA for that matter) there would be less of an incentive for them to help athletes cheat.
CFB,3dzgbu,Toon_Squad18,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:53 2015 UTC,Haha then they should try and get rival alumnus to tutor

CFB,3dzgbu,Balleresk42,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:48 2015 UTC,Except the tutors are typically students at the university and the academic advisors have to be associated with the university in order to be effective. Their incentives wouldn't be any different if they get paid by the university or by the conference.
CFB,3dzgbu,b_e_e_r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't that what this is saying though? You have medical observers who are associated with the university but ultimately held accountable by the ACC.  Whether people want to admit it, academic advisors are hired and fired over their ability to keep players eligible. If we change the system so that they aren't beholden to individual programs then it would (hopefully) be free to advise student on what they think is best rather than what they think is most likely to keep them eligible."
CFB,3dzgbu,Toon_Squad18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:57 2015 UTC,"If we look at bad choices by tutors do we see a lot of universities really pressuring otherwise innocent tutors into helping the player's cheat?    Or do they already have that incentive on their own due to being local, working with players, etc?"
CFB,3dzgbu,CantaloupeCamper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that it has to be just cheating. I think that an advisors job really hinges on them keeping players eligible. As a result, I would bet that many student athletes don't receive the best academic advice but rather the best advice that would keep them eligible. I don't think its hard to believe that many athletes are encouraged to take easier courses/majors, and majors that don't conflict with practice schedules.   I also don't think it would entirely alleviate the problem. Certainly these advisors would become close with players and may do some unsavory things to ""help"" them but it would definitely remove one source of pressure."
CFB,3dzgbu,Toon_Squad18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first part, but I'm not sure the conference or NCAA really gives a damn about what quality education they get.   If they did things would be quite different."

Ultimately, these are people's lives and that is more important than the on-the-field achievements of a team. If a player is in a clearly dangerous situation, than an ""impartial"" authority should be able to sit a player for a medical reason. Of course, finding somebody impartial when it won't be controversial will be the difficult part."

CFB,3dz345,JohnQ_Taxpayer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, it is pretty weird. I was at the games yesterday and Saturday, and out of a female army officer on Saturday, a 10 year old little leaguer yesterday, and Kevin Sumlin yesterday, only the 10 year old made it to the plate. And it wasn't lobbed in there either, it was actually a pretty good toss from a kid of that age. The only thing I could maybe compare it to is something like throwing a frisbee, where if you haven't thrown one in a while AND were never really that great at throwing it to begin with (i.e. me) the technique involved in throwing it takes enough skill where you need to actually practice it. Now I think throwing a baseball is far for basic than throwing a frisbee accurately, but even granting that benefit of the doubt that if I were a Sumlin or someone who clearly hasn't tossed a baseball in awhile I wouldn't practice a shit ton before throwing out the first pitch in front of 40,000 people before a growing rivalry game. I can only have sympathy for the army officer who might not have too much time on her hands, but if I were Sumlin I'd be practicing for at least a few days before throwing out the pitch."

You need to find a team that would meet those criteria, and add something (e.g. the FCS power that App State & Georgia Southern added; they didn't say it but you get the sense they do not want another Georgia State situation)."
CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,6,Tue Jul 21 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"In that case, Coastal Carolina would be the ideal choice. It's close to App State and is successful in football and basketball."
CFB,3e0fvt,sixmilesoldier,8,Tue Jul 21 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"Not saying its not a good choice, but it is pretty far from App State (4.75 hours according to Google Maps).  It seems like one of the best candidates, and I certainly hope it happens (South Carolina and Clemson are lonely in the FBS)"
CFB,3e0fvt,mckleeve,6,Tue Jul 21 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"Still closer than Idaho, and I'll take chicken bog over a potato any day."
CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:44 2015 UTC,"Chicken bog, the underappreciated South Carolina dish!  And props for calling it ""bog"", not ""perlo"" or ""perloo"" or ""perleau""."
CFB,3e0fvt,SlowMotionSprint,3,Tue Jul 21 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize South Carolina and Clemson were the only South Carolina teams in the FBS.  EDIT: JMU would also be a good choice, although there are rumors that the MAC is looking at them to replace UMass. The Sun Belt would be a better fit for them IMO."
CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:08 2015 UTC,Why would the MAC want a team to replace UMass when UMass leaving would put them at an even-12?    And where is UMass going?
CFB,3e0fvt,meressy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:10 2015 UTC,No idea. I think they will be independent next year.
CFB,3e0fvt,meressy,4,Tue Jul 21 04:38:41 2015 UTC,We're leaving to become independent because the MAC wanted us to join in all sports.
CFB,3e0fvt,GhostdadUC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:27 2015 UTC,UMass is leaving because the MAC wanted us to join in all sports. We will be independent next year in football.
CFB,3e0fvt,meressy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:01 2015 UTC,God speed to you and your program.  I don't understand the move on your guys part.  Is A-10 basketball really worth being a low tier independent?
CFB,3e0fvt,meressy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"According to admin it's more about travel costs for other sports and a cultural fit. The A-10 is much stronger than the MAC in basketball, but I want to find a permanent home for all our sports sooner rather than later."
CFB,3e0fvt,tightspandex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:37 2015 UTC,Unless they're bringing in two teams the MAC isn't replacing UMass. Divisions are even now. We were brought in as a partner for Temple who left.

CFB,3e0fvt,jnoobs13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:04 2015 UTC,Coastal Carolina is not close to App State.
CFB,3e0fvt,Honestly_,4,Tue Jul 21 13:53:14 2015 UTC,Odd team out as in if no expansion works out then we might get booted?
CFB,3e0fvt,jnoobs13,5,Tue Jul 21 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"No, odd team as in there is no pair like:   GSU-GS USA-Troy ULM-ULL TXST-ARST (a bit forced) NMSU-Idaho (even more forced) App St-???   They (ideally) want to find App State a geographic pairing for a 12th team, which would also allow for even divisions. Again, this is less football than across non-revenue sports where they want to control expenses."
CFB,3e0fvt,holytrolly,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:46 2015 UTC,Ahh thanks for the clarification
CFB,3e0fvt,Martel_the_Hammer,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:47 2015 UTC,I think James Madison would be a great pairing for ASU.
CFB,3e0fvt,bullitt_60,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I really want Chatty to move up. Great town with decent market, nice stadium, and a short drive from Atlanta."
CFB,3e0fvt,jnoobs13,6,Tue Jul 21 03:37:33 2015 UTC,Baseball would be important too.  The Belt is a pretty good baseball conference.
CFB,3e0fvt,bullitt_60,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:15 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Coastal be a good fit then? Haven't been up to date with baseball to be honest.
CFB,3e0fvt,Stickells54,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have an excellent baseball program."

Don't crucify me. I just started watching college baseball a few years ago."
CFB,3e0fvt,Stickells54,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:30 2015 UTC,Then you need to watch more before making comments like this as  South Alabama has the most successful program in the SBC.
CFB,3e0fvt,CockADoodleBOOM,0,Tue Jul 21 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Okay. Well, in the two years I have watched, that hasn't been the case. So, thanks for that info."
CFB,3e0fvt,navi555,6,Tue Jul 21 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"It seems like if Coastal keeps up its strong run in football, they'll be the obvious choice. Their basketball arena is pretty small at 3,600, so that'll probably need to be improved on. Otherwise, the baseball team is great (a national seed as recently as 2010) and they have a fun (read: party-hard) fan base and a neat niche as ""the school by the beach."" Seems like a logical choice for the Fun Belt."
CFB,3e0fvt,reptheevt,5,Tue Jul 21 03:07:16 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen a SBC team with a full arena anyway.
CFB,3e0fvt,jnoobs13,5,Tue Jul 21 03:51:35 2015 UTC,Would UMass as football only work? Or do they want full members.

CFB,3e0fvt,RegionalBias,5,Tue Jul 21 02:33:11 2015 UTC,Coastal is good at soccer and our conference just lost NJIT. They'd be perfect.
CFB,3e0fvt,camb42,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:35 2015 UTC,Preferably with mens soccer as well
CFB,3e0fvt,navi555,9,Tue Jul 21 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"Notre Dame. They agree to give them first choice of the women, and agree that if they are playing close to throw the game at the end."
CFB,3e0fvt,camb42,4,Tue Jul 21 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"Any thoughts on a team like Murray State making it in?  Great fan support, decent football, and good basketball."
CFB,3e0fvt,navi555,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:37 2015 UTC,There was talk about EKU making the transition as well.
CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Just as good, as EKU is re-emerging as an OVC force in hoops, and their football team is on the up and up."
CFB,3e0fvt,Hobartacus,2,Tue Jul 21 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"OVC and Murray are fun to watch.  Also, I miss these two as rivals."
CFB,3e0fvt,GeauxNate,0,Tue Jul 21 04:00:18 2015 UTC,I too always love it when an athletic conference plays a University
CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,4,Tue Jul 21 04:45:56 2015 UTC,"Montana, Montana St., SF Austin, Richmond, Jacksonville St., Sam Houston St., Liberty, or Coastal Carolina would be good choices for Sun Belt expansion.  EDIT: One thing about Liberty: they have a terrible basketball program"
CFB,3e0fvt,GeauxNate,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:43 2015 UTC,I think Richmond is happy where they are. They'd have to add onto a football stadium they already don't fill to meet FBS requirements. Plus they'd be leaving all their football rivals behind. I love the school but I think moving to the Sun Belt would be bad for them.
CFB,3e0fvt,thatrightwinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:06:20 2015 UTC,Montana? For the Sun Belt?
CFB,3e0fvt,reptheevt,12,Tue Jul 21 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really doubt they will add a school anywhere close to Idaho."
CFB,3e0fvt,thatrightwinger,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:04 2015 UTC,I posted this before the guidelines were posted. I was indeed thinking of a good team close to Idaho haha.
CFB,3e0fvt,reptheevt,4,Tue Jul 21 00:50:53 2015 UTC,I'd love to see SELA make their way in.
CFB,3e0fvt,theladymango,3,Tue Jul 21 00:39:15 2015 UTC,what no discussion in bringing in Presbyterian?
CFB,3e0fvt,ULalum06,4,Tue Jul 21 03:43:03 2015 UTC,Presbyterian is way too small. Their stadium only holds 6500 and they would be the smallest FBS school by enrollment by quite a bit. Presbyterian has 1400 students according to Wikipedia. I think Tulsa is the smallest school and they have 4000.
CFB,3e0fvt,theReluctantHipster,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:55 2015 UTC,"That was a bit of a joke.  I thought about putting an ""/s,"" but decided against it.  I only mentioned it because it's generally in that area, and plays a FBS team or two every year and gets paid for the drubbing they inevitably get."

There are too many LA schools already and Liberty is baggage no university president wants. JMU is preferred but they are holding out for CUSA I've heard. Jacksonville is blocked by Troy and USA. The only one on this list possibly happening is Coastal. Even then, if we can have a CCG with 10 we will. Don't hold yer breath."

CFB,3e0fvt,bakerman2017,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:52 2015 UTC,What makes JMU a good market?
CFB,3e0fvt,DCAbloob,7,Tue Jul 21 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"Virginia is a populated state, JMU is only 2 hours away from DC"

CFB,3e0fvt,Roadman90,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:47 2015 UTC,JMU is a good choice but I personally think they would fit better in CUSA. They would have a built-in rivalry with ODU and be close to Charlotte and Marshall.
CFB,3e0fvt,metzoforte1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:48:20 2015 UTC,The chatter on JMU boards has been that the school doesn't want in the Sun Belt and is holding out for a C-USA or MAC offer.

You can receive the ball, kick off, or defer your choice to the second half. UCLA won the toss, and chose to defer. Texas then chose to kick to start the game. Which meant UCLA got the ball to start each half. IIRC, the ref even informed the Texas captains of what they were doing and they still chose to kick."

CFB,3e004r,newmaninlaca,26,Mon Jul 20 22:17:51 2015 UTC,"This quote is far more telling:  “There are those that believe we should get larger, and they feel strongly about it.  There are those who believe we should stay at ten, and they feel strongly about it.  And there are probably four or five in the middle who are persuadable one way or the other. I think that’s exactly where we’re at.  At the present time, I don’t think there’s critical mass for expansion. ”   — Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby  That's a far cry from a couple of weeks ago when the Big 12 admins were saying ""Boren is pretty much alone (in wanting expansion)"""
CFB,3e004r,Fifth_Down,14,Mon Jul 20 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time figuring out which members are having a hard time deciding on expansion.  WVU should want a travel partner.  Baylor, TCU, Iowa State, K-State and maybe Kansas should all be worried about being left in the cold.  Oklahoma has said that they are in favor of expansion and Oklahoma State is generally tied to Oklahoma on most matters.  That leaves Texas and Tech against expansion who seem content with the way things are.  I really wonder if most are in favor but not all of them are willing to come out and say on record that they are in favor."
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:44 2015 UTC,As far as I am aware there are no voting blocks in the Big 12. Nor can I think of any demographic or political issue that would cause one to exist.  If UT wanted expansion the Big 12 would probably have done it by now if it's being pushed by both OU and UT.
CFB,3e004r,Fifth_Down,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"Can you help me understand how travel partners would work?  I know that if WVU had a school close, that would make it easy for them to play each other in each sport once or even multiple times a year, but how does being a travel partner work?  Do they drive to Cincinnati, then fly with Cincinnati to Texas for swim meets?  What actually happens with travel partners?    Also, do you think USF and UCF do this now?  Why or why not?  The concept of travel partners doesn't really make sense to me."
CFB,3e004r,citronauts,6,Tue Jul 21 01:46:46 2015 UTC,That's essentially correct.  It's really only used for non football sports.  Basically wvu will fly to cincy and then they will share a plane to let's say kansas.  From there cincy will play Kansas on Thursday and then kansas state on saturday.  Wvu will do the opposite.  It also really helps out the other teams in the conference as they can now do the same to cincy and wvu.  Non revenue sports are all about cutting costs and having a travel partner cuts down on a ton of flight costs.
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:05 2015 UTC,That doesn't seem to make much of an economic difference.
CFB,3e004r,citronauts,7,Tue Jul 21 02:50:23 2015 UTC,It definitely does.  I worked for a jet charter service and let me tell you chartering a jet is expensive as shit and most athletes fly charter when they travel by plane (which WVU has to do for every away conference competition).  If you were to charter a small 8 passenger jet from my company to fly from Cincinnati to Austin it would cost you a few grand.  We're talking of cost savings of upwards of a couple million dollars a year for the athletic department if they can split the costs of all of their non-revenue sports with another school.
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:52 2015 UTC,Why don't they just fly commercial?
CFB,3e004r,citronauts,6,Tue Jul 21 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"Availability is the big concern along with chartering being less of a time burden and less of an opportunity for luggage to get lost.  When chartering there is very lax security, you bring your bags to the plane, the flight leaves on your schedule which is the big issue.  Flying commercial would be a logistical nightmare as well as you would have to buy a ticket for each individual person for every flight along with check ins.  Then there is the possibility that you could be bumped off the plane and then be left behind and miss your competition.  Flying commercial would basically be impossible for an athletic department that has to possibly fly multiple teams every single week."
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:48 2015 UTC,All very interesting.  I had always assumed revenue sports like football and basketball chartered and everyone else flew commercial.  After your explanation it makes a lot of sense to be able to charter.  I didn't even consider equipment... duhhhhh
CFB,3e004r,citronauts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:20 2015 UTC,And yes.   I think usf and ucf both do this now for non revenue sports along with Houston and smu.
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of vocal WVU supporters who don't want UC. I hinted that it was a turf battle over recruits, but one of them posted the #s and it's lower than you'd think.  Maybe WVU likes being unique?"
CFB,3e004r,RegionalBias,4,Tue Jul 21 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"Probably.  If they don't want UC then they don't want any other program in the Big 12 because we basically only recruit Cincinnati, Indiana, Georgia and Florida.  I don't really see it being a recruit fight.  I think they just see UC as being below them more than anything else."
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"Meh, as a WVU fan my concern is not so much with Cincy, but rather the potential pitfalls of being overeager to expand.   I'm sure you remember how crazy shit became the last few years of the old Big East. Teams joining and leaving every other day, programs being added all the way across the fucking country in a desperate attempt to stay relevant. Shit was bad.   Now obviously the situation with the Big 12 is nowhere near as unstable or toxic as the old Big East, but thats kind of the point I'm making. The Big 12 doesn't need to just start snapping up programs right now, we have the time to wait and look over things before we start extending bids to every school who has had half a pulse in football in the past couple years.  So yeah it would be nice to have a travel buddy in Cincy, the resurrection of an old opponent that generally produced entertaining games, and a conference game that wouldn't require booking a flight for - but Cincy ain't going anywhere, so lets not rush into this."
CFB,3e004r,Das_Boot1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, its better off for the conference to bear the cost of not having cincy for a year or two to see how things play out vs bringing in more people and possibly ruining/ leading to the dissolve of the B12"

It drives me nuts that we do this kind of nonsense too.  For a full catalog, in bold is yelling:   ""Oh say can UC...""  ""And the rocket's BLUUUUE glare""  ""Oh say dost that star spanGOLD banner""  ""O'er the land of the free, and the home of the BEARS!!!!""  When I first started going to games in '96 as a kid only ""Blue"" and ""Bears"" were yelled.  By the time I was a graduating senior in '13, everything else had joined it.  The Athletic Department basically knows they can't get the student body to kill it, although on special occasions (if a visiting band* is joining our band in playing or when we marked alumnus Ambassador Steven's passing), they will ask through the Mic Men (yell leaders) for the students not to.  At this point though it's been going on for at least 2 decades, so it has transitioned to alumni and is something that can't really be broken.    When I was little I thought it was funny, but it got old real fast (also that other words started cropping up didn't help my opinion of it either).  I wish stadiums fans would sing the national anthem in general more, whether there is a band performing or a solo artist.

I feel like the National Anthem and other patriotic acts previously served to deal with how tough WWII, Vietnam etc. were on all Americans.  Now those songs really seem to pay homage to more recent veterans.  As someone who did not choose or have to go to war, I think that doing anything that takes away from the song's importance is disrespectful to living veterans in attendance.   The fact that many sports teams do it makes me think that Americans in general are becoming more complacent and removed from what I imagine are the horrors of war."

CFB,3e004r,Fifth_Down,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"Of the top of my head...  One of these two groups are likeliest to move first:   OU, OSU are packaged together. They go either Pac 12 or Big 10. UT goes Pac 12 or possibly SEC. Might bring Tech along with it.   If one group leaves then the other has two choices: stay or go. If they stay then they try to strengthen the conference with more expansion and Kansas State stays. If they choose to go the conference begins to unravel.  If both go then you have two P-5 conferences with more members (with lucrative additions at that) and I doubt that the remaining two P5s don't add members to keep up. So then you have at least four more teams taken (two per remaining P5). I could go into various scenarios of teams landing in different conferences but I don't see Kansas State  not being one of the (at least) four taken.   K-State is certainly a better target then whoever you might think the bottom two schools are, and I don't see a non P5 jumping ahead of the Big 12 schools (maybe Cinnci to ACC or waaay outside chance of Memphis to SEC but thats probably it.)"
CFB,3e004r,willOTW,3,Tue Jul 21 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"Before I start what may result in a rant (and a debate, as these things tend to go), I would like to say that I'm rooting for K-State in realignment. I think if one of the two Kansas schools gets locked out of a major conference it will be the death of that schools athletic programs.  That said, I don't see it your way at all. A lot of people assume that there is some law on the books that prevents Oklahoma and OKST from leaving each other, but no one has ever actually seen said law. Without that, Oklahoma is free to go where it wants. Now, I'm sure it will be easier with their legislatures if they both go to the same conference, buy they don't have to. Taking that out of the conversation, I think the most likely scenarios will be:   Texas, Tech, Oklahoma, and OKST to the PAC: this makes the most sense as it already almost happened, so the PAC must have been interested. KU might be able to sneak their way into the B1G if this were to happen, as they are AAU, but it would be difficult if they don't have some one to go with them. Texas and Oklahoma split for the B1G: Yes, the B1G has the AAU requirement which Oklahoma won't meet, but if they can land both of the big fish, I think they will make an exception. If this happens, I could see KU, KSU, OKST and Tech going to the PAC. Texas wants to go to the PAC, but OU somehow has gotten into the AAU and would rather go B1G: I think this could happen even if they don't get in the AAU, they are just too big of a pick up to not take. If this where to happen I think Texas, Tech, OKST, and K-State would go to the PAC. KU would go to the B1G with OU, as that would seem to be our preferred destination and we are AAU.    Any way you slice it though, I would say, and again not trying be a dick, K-State is in the bottom two of the Big XII in conference realignment (this excludes Baylor and TCU from the PAC, as they are private religious schools, but in every other conference they would rank ahead of KSU , if for no other reason than the Texas recruiting and market). KSUs athletic department makes the next to least amount of money in the Big XII.* And they aren't in the AAU or considered the flagship school of the state. They also don't bring even half of a major TV market (KU owns most of NE Kansas, Kansas City, and Wichita). That said, I firmly believe that in most situations they find a home (unlike Iowa State), I just think that saying they aren't in the bottom two is wrong.  *That list doesn't include private schools, which probably rank above A LOT of programs."
CFB,3e004r,SKyJ007,3,Tue Jul 21 02:01:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of what you say, and I think K-State is near the bottom of the rung, but I disagree on several of your points/scenarios.   OU/OSU I agree that people lump them together, and it isn't a 100% certainty, but it isn't something you can just dismiss out of hand.     If you see 4 teams go to the PAC (particularly UT and OU with all that revenue) I highly doubt that the other P5 conferences will be fine with a PAC-16 and the extra all revenue they will generate when the next TV negotiations come around. I don't think the AAU membership is as big of a stumbling block as people think. AAU membership is based on money. If the conference can make more money by adding a non AAU school they will. I mostly agree with what you have here.    K-State is in the bottom two of the Big XII   Baylor, TCU and Iowa State are probably below in just about every category. (Unless Texas Legislature slings them along). WVU also has issues with PAC and possibly more issues with B1G than K-State.   if for no other reason than the Texas recruiting and market   SEC already has this market. With Texas going to a different conference that takes up most of the state. Tech and one other might split to different conferences, but they are more likely to go with Texas.   KSUs athletic department makes the next to least amount of money in the Big XII.*   They also are the second/ third most profitable. If you added in University subsidies on the same level as other schools the revenue shoots way up. But with the high profit it isn't necessary.   And they aren't in the AAU    AAU is only an issue for the B1G. On a positive note, the University is in the middle of a big (no pun intended) push to be a top 50 research university by 2025. And with the NBAF research $ are expected to grow by tens of millions a year. Of course, not all of this helps with AAU categorized research, but if the B1G is going to be lenient with its rules, its going to be lenient with a school that spends hundreds of millions on research.   or considered the flagship school of the state.    Not really an issue in a state without a singular flagship   They also don't bring even half of a major TV market   KU has less than half of the KC market, and to balance that point, neither does MU. Both obviously have much larger shares than Kansas State, but two takeaways from the MU to SEC move tells you about media markets (at least KC), football is king and you don't need to have the entire market- just a significant portion.  While we are on the topic of TV viewerships, Kansas State was one of the better performing teams on TV last year, or just using raw unfiltered data still around the bottom- but still ahead of several- P5 programs.  A lot of your arguments point out valid weaknesses in Kansas  State's resume. But you also ignore a lot of strengths as well. Increasing enrollments, expanding some of the largest research initiatives in the country, top of the line facilities, recent football success on the field and the audience that brings.  My point to all of this is that Kansas State does not need to be the most attractive candidate to an expanding P5 conference, or even control its destiny the way OU/Texas and OSU/Texas Tech can. We just have to be the prettiest girl left when someone wants to dance."

I would like to reiterate that I think you guys will probably be in a power conference when it's all said and done. But I think the two most likely destinations for KSU are the PAC or the SEC. The PAC may do it to round out numbers, and if so I actually think it would be a great pickup for them. The SEC might do it also, but I only see the SEC picking you guys up if every other conference is going to 16, and if they can't expand East in the form of poaching off the ACC.  But this is all speculation. At the end of the day, it's going to be complete chaos. The only school that I think is completely screwed is Iowa State and that's a shame in, and of, itself."

Personally I see one of those two scenarios as how realignment will kick off again, but I could totally be wrong. This stuff is always crazy. That's just what I think will be the most likely or actually trigger mass realignment (if Tech somehow bolted for example, but UT and OU stayed not much would change).   I would like to reiterate that I think you guys will probably be in a power conference when it's all said and done.   This is my main point I usually make. I do think its of course a real possibility we get left out, but I think it is much more likely we get taken. I think your PAC/ SEC scenarios are likely.  I'm not trying to puff out K-State's chest here- I think we are one of the last or possibly last taken. But to me it doesn't matter if you are first or last taken, the reward is the same if you are in a P5 conference.   At the end of the day, it's going to be complete chaos.    THIS   The only school that I think is completely screwed is Iowa State   I agree, but I think there are a few scenarios where they aren't on the outside looking in (could be at our expense too)."

There are also other AAU members that could be offered membership instead, and would bring new media markets."

CFB,3e004r,Fifth_Down,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:38 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part with your assessment. So most of what will follow is nitpicky.   Texas agree with everything here OU I would be more inclined to put them in Top for PAC and moderate for SEC, but while still leading the moderates in the SEC. I would also put them as moderate for B1G. West Virginia agree Tech/OSU agree, but also think if they are force bundled with Texas/ OU they would be taken by the B1G if necessary. Baylor/TCU agree Kansas I would switch SEC and B1G. SEC would be lower for me than PAC, possibly ACC. Kansas State Illl go with moderate/ ISHTF for ACC, then PAC, next to impossible for SEC then B1G but still could happen if necesary. Iowa State ISTF for ACC, then either SEC/ PAC next to impossible for B1G but still taken if necessary.   Again, to me it doesn't matter how far down K-State ranks in conference realignment, I still see it getting taken by a P-5. Last kid picked on the playground is still on a team.   I also don't see realignment happening for at least a year or two (could be further out though, a good portion depends on how the bowl season pans out) and during that time K-State will be shoring up a lot of the weakness harp on, as it has been doing for the last 5+ years.  If anyone wanted to know what a institutional push to ensure P5 status by a smaller school looks like, Kansas State is the place to study."
CFB,3e004r,willOTW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"I put OU in the ""moderate"" slot for the Pac because they made a failed bid to get into the Pac without Texas.  The B1G is pretty deadset against Tech and schools like tech thanks to a couple of slips from Gordon Gee. Hence my putting them & OSU in the impossible category for the B1G.  It's debatable with KU, however the reoccurring them in this setup is that I am very very tough on B1G admission standards. Despite being ranked with a ""low"" chance KU is the second most probable school on that list.  That's just my reasoning on things. Sorry for being the ""crushing optimism with realism"" type but that's just how I operate. The current college administrative landscape is still a powdered keg. However it is not as explosive as it was in the buildup to 2010-2013, but there is a good chance we will see some explosions go off in the future.

But I also don't think when push comes to shove they will worry about image if it means increasing revenue (Nebraska is a good example- not saying the schools left are Nebraska).

Kansas isn't going to try and ride this out knowing we might actually have options this time.  Then the question remains, without the stick of power of UT, do the remaining members try and band together and pull in 5 more (UH, CSU, UC, UM, UCF...) and create a fairly decent high level mid major or does everyone scramble? Pulling together would probably be the better option for half of the remaining, and could work out for the other half if pulled off right.

It's just how the Colorado State Legislature wants to define the roles of the public universities that are holding them back.  If CSU was allowed the establish itself top flight research university in STEM, they could in time, but the legislature pushes CU forward in that area, so it handcuffs CSU.  CSU tracks well academically against other P5 schools, their athletics have tons of potential, the AD is good, its just the legislature.  I think overall Colorado has an inferiority complex about being in between the midwest and west coast, and it reflects in the way CU gets the attention for being part of the Pac 12, and its association with other large research universities, and seems to be some sort of glass ceiling for CSU.  But I'm not sure how easy that would be to change given the size of the state, the budget and how many tech and government research facilities are already associated with CU.

It was a great push to get it established as one too, Bill Morgan was a big deal getting it done, and CSU has grown tons.  And Penley is doing a great job trying to expand that.  However, because of how the legislature set up the schools, CU was the university, CSU was the ag school, UNC is the teacher's school.   And state funding, federal research grants and specialization have all played to those lines.  CU offers more undergraduate degrees, more advanced degrees, it has the Law School and the Medical School.  That's the way the legislature set it up, and they were very resistant in changing it.  That's why it took so long for CSU to become CSU."

CFB,3e004r,thermoroach,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:31 2015 UTC,Yup.  They really fucked up that one.  We had a good 4 way rivalry brewing in the Big East also.
CFB,3e004r,GhostdadUC,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:40 2015 UTC,Pitt was already gone for the ACC. Picking up the Cards to go along with WVU would have made the most sense honestly.
CFB,3e004r,Das_Boot1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"There are rumors that Pitt and Rutgers both knew they were out of the Big East, long before everything fell apart. Hence they were the most vocal opponents to the Big East T.V contract, which started all the defections.   From Pitt insiders, they claim they had an open invitation to the Big 12, and ACC and picked the latter for basketball/academics/non-revenue sports. Likewise Rutgers had open invitations to the B1G and ACC, and picked the B1G (thank goodness!).   What I always found interesting is that Louisville wasn't guaranteed a landing spot, and Tom Jurich found them a way out."

CFB,3e1t15,bullitt_60,2,Tue Jul 21 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"But FCS doesn't have NEARLY the amount of money involved.  As the writer says, that's 120 teams missing out of a game of revenue......yeah not going to happen.  That's the leagues missing out on championsip game money, not going to happen.

There is no money in the FCS and you have to pay the NCAA to compete as they take half of your ticket revenue.    We've only been at 12 games since '05 and that game was created to generate additional revenue.  If the FBS playoff were to expand, the 12th game would no longer be necessary as the majority of programs would lose money on it."
CFB,3e1t15,bullitt_60,9,Tue Jul 21 14:02:35 2015 UTC,So it seems like the theme of SEC media days is head coaches arguing for ways to get their teams into the playoffs because they can't get there on their own merits as it stands?
CFB,3e1t15,dublinirish,26,Tue Jul 21 09:51:16 2015 UTC,You mean the theme of all media days is coaches saying things that would benefit them?  No.  Freaking.  Way.
CFB,3e1t15,cmdrcaboose2,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:17 2015 UTC,why don't they just saw 2 SEC teams should be guaranteed in the playoffs every year? that would make more sense

CFB,3e1t15,rebelde_sin_causa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:40:35 2015 UTC,Polls in general are a horrible way to rank.  No person can watch enough games to accurately rank 120 football teams.  And even if they did the human brain isn't equipped to handle that amount of information.  People end up voting based on biases and opinions because it's what they know.  Imagine someone removed all of the jersey colors and names from teams and asked you to watch film of teams 1 through 120 and rank them.  You'd never be able to.  In order to not go insane ranking teams you have to rely on past information and inclinations.  Just how it happens.
CFB,3e1t15,Swarles_mf_Barkley,0,Tue Jul 21 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"Most definitely, what a farce. In saying that some of media folks who had votes on their poll were just as bad."
CFB,3e1t15,dublinirish,4,Tue Jul 21 10:48:16 2015 UTC,"It would appear the theme of all conference media days is entire conversations with coaches on a topic, reduced to a single tweet (or article like this one which is just word vomit surrounding a tweet to make it look like an actual article).  Just once in a while I wouldn't mind reading the full argument someone like Freeze is trying to make before deciding if we should bust out our pitchforks on this sub... or maybe hear the full context of one of Art Briles' jokes."
CFB,3e1t15,Boyhowdy107,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:40 2015 UTC,You can go and read the full transcripts if you wish i guess? Tbh the goal of media days for every HC should be to not say anything dumb and not provide any noticeboard material for other teams. Surprising how many coaches can't understand this.
CFB,3e1t15,dublinirish,2,Tue Jul 21 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"How do I know if it what Freeze said is dumb or not if I only have 14 words? I mean a coach could go all ""we're on to Cincinnati"" to be completely safe, but if you say anything at all, you can find yourself on Twitter like this, taking all sorts of fire from people based on a single sentence or phrase."
CFB,3e1t15,Boyhowdy107,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:23 2015 UTC,I propose a rule that as long as a team starts with the letters OLE and has 8 wins they automatically clinch a spot in the playoffs.

Baylor has a long history under Briles of bullshit scheduling.  Even Utah and Duke are perrenial bottom dwellers of their conferences.  The best Duke team in history was beaten by A&M a couple of years ago with the worse A&M defense in history.  Briles had a great idea when he got there.  He needed to change the perception of Baylor by scheduling easy wins to ensure a bowl.  That worked.  Now he needs to play a real team.

Since OP is flying, I'd assume this won't be the case, but for the love of god do not try to drive and park to the stadium. Same thing if you go downtown to 6th street afterwards. Just take a bus/Uber/Lyft.   If you do go downtown and are looking for some classic college bars, I'd suggest start off with Buckshots just for the cheap drinks, and then hit up Shakespeares or Blind Pig and head to the roof."

That will be a very good game with a great atmosphere.  Both schools have a proud football tradition and both fan bases will be very welcoming.  It isn't a rivalry so everything should be pretty cordial especially with how nice the Tennessee people were in Oklahoma last year.

CFB,3dy335,RammerJammerYlwHamr,5,Mon Jul 20 16:58:02 2015 UTC,How much would it cost to go to a low level conference game at Oregon?
CFB,3dy335,CLSmith15,8,Mon Jul 20 17:19:49 2015 UTC,A hand and a foot rather than an arm and a leg.
CFB,3dy335,burmp,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on three factors; where you want to sit, when you buy your tickets, and where you buy your tickets.  All that said, I have only paid more than face value one time - the Tennessee game a couple of years ago.  Beware: anecdotal evidence forthcoming....  My best experience is with Craigslist on the day of the game.  Fresh inventory hits from people who can no longer make it to the game due to some last minute issue and they are not trying to play the ""price gouge"" game since they have a limited time to sell the seats. At least a dozen times I got great seats at face or less than face value using this method.  I have never been burned by a Craigslist ticket seller.  I realize this method doesn't work for some people - especially those traveling to the game from another city/state/country.    Using the method I described - based on their number of home games this year, that means the ticket cost I'd likely pay is between $50 and $90 for a low-level conference game.   EXCEPTION Those fancy new club seats are not covered by the Craigslist method.  In my experience those seats always go for a premium (unless you know a guy)."
CFB,3dy335,CLSmith15,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Club seats are the best thing in the world! I've only been to two games in Autzen, one back in 2007 and this past year for the USD game. My uncle got mid-level 50 yard line club seats for free from his father-in-law. Holy shit, what a different environment. The bathrooms are pristine, the concessions and shops in there are way nicer, free motherfucking popcorn all game long. I definitely did not belong in that section, it was amazing."

Alabama allows you to upgrade your normal student ticket to a ""student guest ticket"" for a fee (Ole Miss game is 75 dollars) where they give you a paper ticket and no ID is required. Useful for if you're bringing a friend or just want to sell your ticket to someone else (student to student transfers can still be done electronically at no charge)"

Mariners host the Oakland A's on Oct 4th at 12:30pm for the last game of the season. The Mariner's are terrible (so are the A's actually) but Safeco Field is one of the most beautiful ballparks around.  Vancouver Canucks host Edmonton Oilers on Oct. 3rd. My home city, hockey matches are always fun and although the Canucks are likely to be rebuilding this year, this should be a good game between two Western Canada teams.   Just a heads up, Seahawks' and Canucks' tickets are going to cost you an arm and a leg. Mariners' are much more affordable.   EDIT: Seattle Sounders host the LA Galaxy on Oct. 4th.   I know you're from Manchester, but Seattle is generally considered to have one of the best supporters in MLS and this should be a heated game against rivals.

After the game go to a nearby bar or restaurant to wait for traffic to clear up.    In terms of games to go see, there's too many for me to check the schedules of every team in CFB,  NFL, NHL,  NBA, etc. But every city you mentioned has one or more college or professional sports teams. Just look up things on Google like ""New York Giants schedule"" or ""Dallas Mavericks schedule"" and see if the dates line up.

The reason you don't want to join a conference has nothing to do with economics but with your self perpetuating narrative myth that you are ""special"".  The reality is Notre Dame is where great talent goes to waste.   USC, Stanford, Baylor, Vanderbilt, Miami etc. etc. all private schools that have no problem being in a conference, and enjoy being a part of their conference.   The other reason you don't want to join is.. you all want to bs bend the rules to give you an advantage which (cough cough refs do on many occasions for you anyway)  Basically whether you want to admit it or not you are the only Asshole team out there that wants special privileges and wants to bend the rules in their favor.    And just to show it's not an economic issue. University of Michigan - Football revenue - 91M,  University of Alabama - Football revenue - 94.9 Notre Dame - Football revenue - 80,5 M  So there are two public schools as an example (there are more) that are part of a revenue sharing conferences that are making more money without special contracts than Notre Dame.  It's not about money.  It's about the ""I'm ""special"" myth, and I want special rules."

Notre Dame doesn't want to give up the marketed image they have worked hard to portray, and being a part of a conference makes them well...like everybody else, and they don't want that.  But the issue is that making special rules just for them isn't fair to 99.9% of everybody else that is working together."
CFB,3dyduy,sparkreason,6,Mon Jul 20 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"As far as the playoff final 4 is concerned, there is really no difference between Notre Dame and teams like TCU, Baylor, except that Notre Dame arranges all of their games on an individual basis (sorta, depending on how you view their 5 ACC game partnership) while TCU, Baylor is prescheduled for 9 of their games and get to pick 3 others."
CFB,3dyduy,bobby8375,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'm of the belief that if Notre Dame joins a conference and becomes just like any other team then they're actually at risk of departing from national, big-time football status, slowly fading away from the spotlight, only to become similar to when Navy and Army were powerhouses and are now not too special at football. That thought scares the crap out of me, so I'll defend any effort to undertake separation from everyone else."

""We make soooo much money on our own why wold we need a conference"" was what they used to say.  Now they don't make as much money as others and are getting passed up.  So what's the excuse now?

Notre Dame aggressively went out and got numerous people in prominent positions to help sway votes in the AP.  This continued further with getting special TV deals with NBC, and then further with the ""Notre Dame"" rule for the BCS.   It's a long history of special concessions because of the power Notre Dame holds in the decision making process they accumulated years ago.   Because they refuse to join a conference now that the conferences are working together to decide a championship system once again Notre Dame is trying to leverage special concessions (read the Orange Bowl rules)  Also on the Board of Managers there is a 1 rep from every single conference, Sun Belt to SEC Big XII to ACC etc.  Just 1 representative for all the teams in that conference.  And a rep from Notre Dame.  Meaning that Notre Dame has the same voting power as THE ENTIRE SEC.  That is a gigantic disparity in proportional representation of the college football landscape."

There's no way in hell that USC doesn't take that deal. They can keep old rivalries, get MORE power, and even more exposure than they already have.

Obviously all P5 teams have a better shot at winning championships when they are the only ones elligible.  The justification may have been pretty weak, but he isn't crazy for trying to help his team's odds.  This is no different than Bielema crying about HUNH offenses (though his comments were a bit slimy due to using real player deaths as evidence) or Saban railing against satellite camps.    Also, to be fair, Notre Dame specifically has benefitted somewhat from their status and gotten unfair treatment vs P5 schools because of it....I think it is only natural that coaches would start to voice things like this.  Nobody else has gotten team specific guaranteed inclusion in BCS bowls or the playoff (albeit conditional), and Notre Dame has been greatly overrepresented within the NCAA when voting on rule changes, post season format, etc.    I don't remember the specific issue, but I remember Nick Saban vocally complaining after a meeting a few years ago where each of the P5 conferences +Notre Dame got a vote....Essentially his complaint was that Notre Dame's vote counted 12x as much as Alabama's, which seemed fair to me. (Forgive me, I'd like to provide a source but google is failing me.  If anyone knows what I'm talking about and can link it would be much appreciated.)  Anyway, in a nutshell, Pinkel is not crazy.

What I'm trying to say is, Notre Dame will likely never find themselves in the situation TCU was in last year, as the way things are currently gives them an edge in ""jump balls.""  When they can get the benefit of the doubt, they almost always will.  Most other teams have to keep winning and hope things play out in their favor.    It's certainly not a blatantly unfair advantage, but it's an advantage nonetheless that nobody else enjoys."

I would like to see what Pinkel implies; a college playoff from only winners of a P5 conference. The problem of course, what to do with the conference without a slot in the 4 team playoff? Naturally, expand it to an 8 team playoff, with 3 at large bids. I know that ND loves its independent status, but I for one, would love to see ND get out of the ACC and join the Big 10. I mean we have great history with Big 10 teams, and it geographically makes so much sense. Apart from money, I think ND loses something by not being in a conference. If ND doesn't make and win the national championship game, it's sort of an empty feeling without having a conference season to reflect on. Maybe there's something I'm missing with my thinking."

Things were messy enough last year with 5 conference champs... ok maybe we sorta had 6 with Baylor/TCU. But I guess the argument is that you would want Notre Dame to join the B1G or something so things are at least easier for the CFP committee to compare and narrow down.  The alternative of course would be to expand the CFP to something like 8 or even 6... so that your 5 big conference champions get a slot and you have either 1 or 3 spots for at-large bids.

While his comparison was weak, I think he has somewhat of a point. In my perfect world every conference will play by the same rules, if it's 9 conference games, no FCS, and a system where the best two teams go to the conference championship, then so be it. Will it happen? I highly doubt it, but the current system leaves a lot to debate about at the end of the season, does a cochampion deserve a spot more than another? Does a one loss independent deserve better than a team like Ohio State last year with a conference championship and a bad loss?"

In my perfect world every conference will play by the same rules   Fine, then why don't you start playing 9 conference games and/or a round robin. Switch to our rules instead of yours. Ours are fair and balanced.   Does a one loss independent deserve better than a team like Ohio State last year with a conference championship and a bad loss?   Don't lose and we can find out on the field. I have no sympathy for any team that loses a game and doesn't get in.

Well yeah that's one of the reasons Mizzou left, because they wouldn't go back to 12.    Fine, then why don't you start playing 9 conference games and/or a round robin. Switch to our rules instead of yours. Ours are fair and balanced.   I said I wouldn't mind a 9 game conference schedule, just that every conference has the same rules. In fact I'd personally favor a 9 game con 3 game noncon with a conference championship.   If a team wins every game and played at least 9 P5 opponents they should be in, if you lose then you should have to impress.   Well of course those teams are in, we only saw one of those teams last year though, most years we will only see one or two of them (possibly an undefeated G5 which makes things even worse). The problem is there are usually a bunch of teams fighting for the last spot. So when you have two cochampions, a team with a bad loss and a conference championship and a 1 loss independent, it makes everything that much more difficult."

In the SEC there are plenty of years where an 11-1 team won't make the Title Game, as their one loss is to a team in their division. Then on their resume, ""couldn't even win their own division"" is there. Aside from the Bama bias, this has never benefited anyone, but is a big factor for lots of teams. Teams know going in if they don't win the head to head against the other good team in their division they are cooked. Notre Dame 11-1 is a lot smaller hurdle than anyone else has to face.  From that perspective, it's an unfair advantage. Now, I wouldn't particularly care if it wasn't a subjective committee deciding who was 1-4. If there was a BCS formula and the human element was eliminated, by all means, Notre Dame is free to do whatever they want. But as is, they play by a different set of rules and it benefits them."

Every team in the west is so strong and at least 3 are in the top 10 every year.

CFB,3e30yk,Casaiir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yes the series is pretty even, but the West is on a 6-game winning streak so it's not a ridiculous question.  And you're not really telling the full story with the final rankings you've posted:   2014: #4 Alabama, #9 Georgia 2013: #2 Auburn, #4 South Carolina, #5 Missouri, #7 Alabama 2012: #1 Alabama, #5 Texas A&M (tied), #5 Georgia (tied),  #8 South Carolina, #9 Florida 2011: #1 Alabama, #2 LSU, #5 Arkansas, #9 South Carolina 2010: #1 Auburn, #8 LSU, #10 Alabama 2009: #1 Alabama, #3 Florida 2008: #1 Florida, #6 Alabama 2007: #1 LSU, #2 Georgia 2006: #1 Florida, #3 LSU, #9 Auburn 2005: #6 LSU, #8 Alabama, #10 Georgia   So in the past 10 years, the SEC's best team in the final rankings was from the West 8 times.  That's what's relevant since we're talking about the best of the East versus the best of the West.  Using these numbers, if we assume the West has an 80% chance of winning the league each of the next three seasons, there is a 51.2% chance that the West will win all three."

CFB,3e30yk,PickSixPreviews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Probability says yes. Like its very likely to happen. Sorry if this math is pedantic, but probability is hard to explain when there is an audience with a wide variety of background knowledge on the subject.  The odds of an SEC East team winning the conference one time in the next 3 years is the same as (1 - the odds of SEC West teams winning the conference all 3 years).   And we know that an SEC East team and an SEC West team face off in a single game to determine the conference champion once a year.  If the East's and West's representative teams were dead even in likeliness of beating each other in an individual game, there would be a 12.5% chance that the West would win all 3 years. This could also be said as there is a 87.5% chance that an SEC East team will win at least once in the next 3 years. The math behind these numbers is simple:   P(SEC West winning all 3 years) =  (.50^3) = .125 = 12.5% P(SEC East winning at least 1 year) = 1 - 12.5% = 87.5%   So just for the sake of answering OP's question, let's assume the East has the exact same, albeit low, chance of beating the SEC West team in the championship each year. And we want to find out what that chance is that will make it probable (>= 50%) that an SEC East team will defeat an SEC West team in one of the next 3 SEC conference championship games.  Working backwards to calculate this:  P(SEC East winning at least 1 year) = 1 - P(SEC West winning all 3 years) >= 50% P(SEC West winning all 3 years) <= 50% = .50 = x^3 x = .50^(1/3) = .7937 = 79.37%   So if the West has a 79.3% chance of winning each individual conference championship, then they still have <= 50% chance of winning all 3 championships. This means the SEC East needs only a 20.7% chance of winning the individual conference championship games in order to have a >= 50% chance of winning at least one conference title in the next 3 years."

CFB,3dyc45,Buckeyeup,4,Mon Jul 20 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"This is...well.  I mean we both dominated Baylor, so that's pretty much a wash, right? Despite common opponents being a very poor argument, you played Colorado at home in week 1. We played Colorado, as a rival, on the road, as the last game of the season, with a potential win giving them bowl eligibility.   But I acquiesce. We had two bad performances in that and Missouri. Still, both were on the road, one to a team that finished ranked, and one to a rival, whereas you squeaked by 21-14 over Notre Dame and 28-24 over Iowa, both at home, and neither of those teams finished ranked. Your six opponents that went to bowl games also went 0-6, none even being within a touchdown.   Michigan beat #9 by 5, #12 by 6, #16 by 26 (going by end of season rankings, which exposed your weak conference and schedule), with a 17.3 ppg differential.  Nebraska beat #7 by 30, #8 by 25, #18 by 13, #20 by 39, and #23 by 7, with a 30.2 ppg differential."
CFB,3dyc45,james_wightman,10,Mon Jul 20 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Don't really feel like arguing this cause I know you won't change your mind, but I'll go point by point:   Not really. They still scored 3 touchdowns on you. Not all that uncommon against Neb. though. I'd say its a better argument than 'You beat a lower ranked team in your bowl,' which is what I was responding to. I don't think the fact that they needed a win to make a bowl makes your 'squeak' as you say any more impressive. Again, I like how your's are 'bad performances' in comparison to squeaking by. Lets not forget you need this to beat a 7 win team in OT. Point differential is a silly argument. Teams averaged single digits against M. They didn't need to score a lot to cover for a very weak defense. Michigan won by a higher % game points.  And I can't help but laugh and the weak conference / schedule. The BigTen had more top 20 teams, more bowl eligible teams, the same amount of bowl wins, higher winning percentage, higher SOS, and higher SRS. Quit being silly. You ran up points in a conference full of third rate defenses and were gifted a 'NC' cause Tommy was retiring."
CFB,3dyc45,Johnnycockseed,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:45 2015 UTC,THATS A DEAD BALL!!!! FUUUUCK.
CFB,3dyc45,orobs,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"You were gifted a 'NC' because you were undefeated Michigan, the storied blue blood in the best conference as advertised by ESPN all year, who hadn't won a championship in 50 years.   If it's fair that you leapfrogged us after our OT game against Missouri when you won a big game the same week, then it's got to be equally fair that we could/would leapfrog you after you survived/struggled/played shitty/whatever verb you want to use against WSU and we depantsed Tennessee.  Point differential isn't a silly argument, because it shows that we had a great defense (12th) and a great offense (1st), whereas you had THE BEST defense (1st) but a very average offense (48th). If we would have played each other, you would have definitely held our offense below averages (even though I think the strength of your defense was more in the passing game), but how would you have scored?   And since you brought up SRS, ours was 22.13 (2nd) and yours was 20.14 (5th).   In the end, Nebraska went 13-0 while playing 5 rated opponents, including 2 higher than anyone you faced, won by an average of 30 points a game, gained 515 yards per game offense, gave up 262 on defense, and won their bowl over the then-#3 team by 25 points. Very few teams in the AP poll era (1936 to present) have put up those kinds of numbers. And the few that have never finished #2."
CFB,3dyc45,lpfortney,4,Mon Jul 20 18:03:09 2015 UTC,Nebraska absolutely should have lost to Missouri. A Nebraska player kept a pass alive in the end zone by kicking the ball to another player. Should have been a dead ball. Nebraska had no business being undefeated that year.

Condescending, arrogant, and inaccurate.  Many of the people posting here are echoing an idea I've had for a long time: Michigan has never really been as great as it claims to be (or really great at all, for that matter).  Aside from brief stints in the mid 70s and 1997, there really isn't much else there.  There is a reason for that: The program doesn't have a winning formula.  The only thing that tied it together whatsoever (Schembechler) is gone.  What remained was a deluge of infighting and a political vacuum, exposing what Michigan really is.    Most of what I hear from Michigan alum is how great the program is historically, and how much smarter ""my school is than your school, which makes me smarter than you.""  It's eerily nationalistic, off-base, uncreative, and most of all, frustratingly ordinary.  There is a general truth in that if you feel the need to preach a quality about yourself, then it probably isn't true.  This goes for the vast majority of braggarts.  Talk about a perennially overrated program.  ...but what astonishes me the most is how the Michigan alum whom I've met attribute their football program to a sort of manifest destiny for being generally right, using it as a validity test for self-righteousness.  Most of its roots seem to reflect this zealous ideology that mostly excuses itself from reason (See: Yost's retirement banquet speech, you know the one about ""deathless loyalty"" and ""gospel"").   It's like they believe that going to Michigan means that they'll be right for the rest of their lives, using Michigan's supposed pedigree as a crutch (which is really just good networking - the main allure of its program I suppose).  It's totally arcane thinking - you can probably chalk it up to some bizarre inferiority complex their parents had and ended up making their children endure it(e.g.: you're better than everyone else).  Michigan only reinforces this with indoctrination and rhetoric, like, ""leaders and the best.""  I've also heard that they have some interesting orientation games that seem rather brainwashy (e.g. which school do you hate?  If you don't say Ohio State, you get buzzed in front of everybody, and are ""wrong.""  That's just what I've heard from an alum though).  Also, the concept of ""Michigan Time"" (that you can be ten minutes late for class because the world revolves around your schedule).  etc., etc., etc.  It's pretty strange.  I guess that what I'm trying to say is that this thread mirrors the saying ""you can never argue with a Michigan fan.""  It sums it up quite nicely.  This thread was great for a good laugh.  Thanks :)  Keep it up. +1."
CFB,3dyc45,pramirez184,12,Mon Jul 20 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, I will bite:   This thread is the most Michigan thing ever. Condescending, arrogant, and inaccurate.   I wouldn't call this overly condescending, arrogant, or inaccurate. Condescending and  arrogant would be our tendency to emphasize only the ""good rankings"" of our school.    Michigan has never really been as great as it claims to be   As /u/macmatic42 said, most wins, second highest winning percentage, third most conference wins are not spurts of greatness.   What remained was a deluge of infighting and a political vacuum, exposing what Michigan really is.   Yes. Hopefully Hackett and Schlissel are breaking that mold.     Most of what I hear from Michigan alum is how great the program is historically, and how much smarter ""my school is than your school, which makes me smarter than you.""   I do agree with you that there are many arrogant students a Michigan. I am quick to admit on being a bit arrogant. However, in regards to us being overrated, I don't like to bring academics into /r/cfb, but since you brought it up:  Not every program at Michigan is ""top-ranked"". However, in programs that are the best at preparing students for the professional world (i.e. giving them jobs) Michigan dominates. Michigan is a top ranked engineering school, law school, medical school, and business school. This is shown year after year of quality rankings. Beyond rankings, Google is building a new campus right next to Michigan's engineering campus. I doubt this is due to being frustratingly ordinary.   If you would like to debate whether Ross is simply connections or a quality program, I would love to have a discussion. Frankly, I think Ross provides more connections than real-world preparation and know many b-students who agree.   This isn't saying we are the best school by any means. There are plenty of quality universities. This is simply saying we are in that group.    There is a general truth in that if you feel the need to preach a quality about yourself, then it probably isn't true.    Michigan doesn't preach that we are good. We expect to be good. We work to be great and do not settle for 2nd, be it an Engineering Design Team or a Dance Team, if you don't get first you have work to do for the next year. This comes off as ""preaching"" we are good.    ...the Michigan alum whom I've met attribute their football program to a sort of manifest destiny for being generally right, using it as a validity test for self-righteousness. Most of its roots seem to reflect this zealous ideology that mostly excuses itself from reason (See: Yost's retirement banquet speech, you know the one about ""deathless loyalty"" and ""gospel""). It's like they believe that going to Michigan means that they'll be right for the rest of their lives, using Michigan's supposed pedigree as a crutch (which is really just good networking - the main allure of its program I suppose).   Yes, networking is a huge plus with a Michigan degree. Networking is how the professional world functions in promotions, jobs, etc. Though I can only speak for the College of Engineering, I can confidently say the curriculum does not use networking as a crutch. Michigan engineering is grueling (though I am sure many other colleges' programs are too). Having a good alumni network does not void the quality of the program; a good alumni network enhances the program.    Michigan only reinforces this with indoctrination and rhetoric, like, ""leaders and the best.""   Beyond this being a cheesy slogan that every University has of some sort (which we mock ourselves), this saying speaks to what I mentioned previously regarding us expecting us to be the best.    I've also heard that they have some interesting orientation games that seem rather brainwashy (e.g. which school do you hate? If you don't say Ohio State, you get buzzed in front of everybody, and are ""wrong."" That's just what I've heard from an alum though).   The only thing any person affiliated with the school said regarding tOSU or MSU was during the Chemistry placement exam where one said, ""There is no need to cheat; if you do poorly we will not send you to MSU."" That is it. Whether they said more with older students I cannot attest to, but recently that statement is not the case.    Also, the concept of ""Michigan Time"" (that you can be ten minutes late for class because the world revolves around your schedule). etc., etc., etc. It's pretty strange.   Every university has some sort of passing period. I don't understand how ours is strange. Regardless, at that point you're nit-picking at Michigan for some personal reason."

CFB,3dyc45,TheRedHand7,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"There's a legit argument that Michigan has underachieved on a national scale. Since Bo Schembechler became coach at Michigan, the Wolverines have been 4-12 in Rose Bowls. Now, those represent a lot of conference championships, but over the same time period UCLA has won 5 Rose Bowls (going 5-1). I wouldn't say the Bruins are on the same level as the Wolverines (I'm not crazy), but it wasn't that long ago that right here people were agreeing with an article that listed UCLA as the most underachieving program in all of college football while Michigan is routinely cited as a football blue blood, when UCLA has more Rose Bowl wins over the last 50 years...you have to admit that there is some kind of disconnect there. A team like Michigan shouldn't have 4-12 record in any bowl game.  Edited to fix Michigan's Rose Bowl record, and to clarify that one of those games was against Texas."
CFB,3dyc45,Buckfutters,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"And you don't think UCLA playing the rose bowl in their back yard and Michigan traveling across the entire country make a difference? At all? Rose bowls and bowls in general just didn't mean that much back then, it was a reward. Bo always stressed big ten titles. It seems like your argument hinges on nothing but UM having poor bowl records. That's fine I guess I'm just not buying it. The all time win% is the number that can't really be touched and shoots down any argument trying to discredit UMs historical significance to CFB as a whole."

I said that there is a legitimate argument that Michigan has underperformed on the national stage...which is exactly what the bowl season is for, to show how good you are on a national stage. Who cares if they had to travel? This was a bowl game, weeks after the regular season, where you have weeks to prepare and arrive in the city days before the game, it should be much easier than traveling during the season.  And, to quote Schembechler himself: ""I have never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a successful season.""  So much for only being concerned with BIG-10 championships, Schembechler flat out said that if they didn't win the Rose Bowl, it wasn't a successful season.  And finally, we aren't talking about ""back then"", we are talking about the last 50 years, which includes some pretty recent years, if I remember correctly."

I don't put much stock into the ratings this early in the cycle though. These kids haven't even played their senior seasons yet. If the evaluations were done before a kid started getting attention from P5 schools they are often pretty much worthless.  Look at Wilson, one of our QB commits. He is one of only two QBs that Oregon has offered (according to 247). Yet he is rated a 5.5 by Rivals, the lowest 3 star."

All of the Big 12's issues could be easily solved with improved play from 1-2 teams in the conference and dominant play from just one. We had a thread earlier today about media storylines to start 2014 that were debunked by the end of the season, and the perception of the B1G was brought up.  Last year, around week 2, everyone was laughing at how bad the B1G was going to be and talking about whatever issues would stem from the lack of competitiveness coming out of that conference. A few months later Wisconsin had a good running back, MSU stomped Baylor and OSU won the national title. Suddenly the B1G was the third best conference in America and primed for great things in the offing.  The Big 12 doesn't have a member problem, a money problem or an ""instability"" problem. We have a football problem, and thankfully there are good coaches in this league to correct that. I'm optimistic.  http://i.imgur.com/xnyheKT.gif"

This does not preclude Baylor from also being bad at football in moments where their conference could use solid, winning play.  And anyway, do you think when Texas lost in the '09 championship game and people made fun of the Big 12, we pointed to Baylor and said, ""Hey, we did our part. We got to a BCS game and lost. These Baylor guys are dragging the conference down..."" No. Losing in big games is embarrassing and you should be embarrassed."

Baylor fans spent half the season complaining about unfair treatment by pollsters and the media, then went to a lesser bowl and absolutely choked. Yes, Texas is terrible. We can start every thread about the Big 12 with that sentence. But at least admit that your time as the best team in the Big 12 has coincided with a devastating blow to the conference's image, and the attitude of your fanbase and performance in bowl games that matter might have something to do with it.  Edit: Okay, I was a dick. I was expecting support from other B12ers for my OP, that improved play across the conference would improve our conference's image. In using the B1G as an example I accidentally insulted Baylor, then you insulted Texas, so I doubled-down on something I honestly didn't feel like talking about in the first place.  Leaving the above for posterity sake."

Kansas losing 41-3 to Duke hurts. Iowa State losing 34-14 to NDSU hurts.    Baylor isn't blaming you guys for losing a championship game.

CFB,3dzyou,charliehorze,5,Mon Jul 20 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"TBH, the only thing I'm blaming Texas for is driving away A&M, Nebraska, Mizzou, and Colorado. Football wise, I don't think it would have made a lick of difference if everyone took care of business in the OOC slate. FSU wasn't getting left out and Ohio State annihilating Wisconsin couldn't be ignored.   Only people we can blame are ourselves for screwing up the Cotton Bowl. If we had won that game, even by 2 points, the conversation would be different. No point in getting caught up in it too much though, since every season is a new tale."
CFB,3dzyou,murgle1012,7,Tue Jul 21 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"I'm saying all of it matters. Texas being garbage is a huge reason the Big 12 is down. That's super obvious. Your examples are perfect, they demonstrate my point exactly. And Baylor going 0-2 in huge bowls is a problem. Everyone can point fingers, or we can all just admit that as a conference we suck at football right now and it's causing a lot of additional headaches."
CFB,3dzyou,uncomfortablyhigh,10,Mon Jul 20 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"Baylor going 0-2 in huge bowls is a problem.   But that isn't a problem. Baylor losing to UCF was embarrassing, but that didn't stop them from being top 10 going into 2014. Losing by 1 to Michigan State won't hurt either, as they'll probably be top 5 going into this season.    The Big 12 is down because some teams (like Baylor) aren't playing any decent OOC games, other teams aren't winning the OOC games they should, and because the conference is cannibalizing itself throughout the year with this round robin scheduling."

I see that Stoops's recruiting hasn't been at an elite level for at least five years now, and because of that, I doubt they'll have a chance at a national title for at least three years. And that's not me predicting that they will be competing for a title in three years, just that recruiting has been so low lately that there's no way they'll be competing for one for at least three years.  I don't have a problem with you criticizing Stoops and OU. I'm not an idiot or a homer (or at least I try not to be). I'm simply annoyed that I'm constantly seeing you say dumb, misleading things like how you think OU's declining ""at rather alarming speeds"" when they've had just one season with less than 10 wins out of the last five, or that Oklahoma's recruiting class is currently ranked behind Texas State, implying that you think it'll actually stay like that come February. Just in case you really didn't know, Stoops's classes have started this slowly for the past few years now. I don't like it, it's not what needs to happen to win national championships, but considering it always ends up in the top-20, it's not nearly as big of a deal as you're making it seem.  Seriously, I'm not trying to start any fights or ""witch hunts"" or whatever the fuck you wanna call it.

Second of all, yes, if the Big 12 had had a CCG last year and TCU and Baylor had been in it, the winner probably would've gone ahead of Ohio State. But there's a fairly good chance that had they had a conference championship game, the Big 12 would've been separated in North and South divisions, and Baylor and TCU would've been in the same division. This would've caused Baylor to play Kansas State in the CCG, which is exactly who they played in the final week of the regular season.  And finally, the fact that Baylor was so close to making it last year just shows that the Big 12 doesn't need a championship game. Last year was the first time in the four years of there being four P5 conference championship games that not a single one of the favorites lost. If a single one of the favorites had lost Baylor would've been in."
CFB,3dzyou,ghetto_draco,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened to Ohio State last year.... It screwed them out of the championship game, but this year it put them into the playoff. It goes both ways."
CFB,3dzyou,fuckqueens,0,Tue Jul 21 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"I understand that. My point is that a conference championship game hurts more often than it helps, for the simple reason that in college football, losses hurt you way more than wins help you."
CFB,3dzyou,ghetto_draco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense, in a perfect world a KSU/Baylor CCG would have helped and probably put one into the playoff, but that doesn't mean it would have taken place."
CFB,3dzyou,fuckqueens,3,Tue Jul 21 04:19:05 2015 UTC,Baylor vs. Kansas State would have helped the Big 12? How? TCU was the closest to making the playoffs. Kansas State wasn't going to make it. If Baylor won they would probably still be behind Ohio State in rankings.
CFB,3dzyou,_edd,7,Tue Jul 21 02:02:52 2015 UTC,"Baylor also played Kansas State on championship weekend, so, in essence, we had the championship game. Baylor won, OSU made the playoffs."
CFB,3dzyou,pwlocke13,0,Tue Jul 21 02:08:38 2015 UTC,"Baylor was ahead of TCU, and why would have it been Kansas State? Baylor and TCU were both 8-1 while Kansas State was 7-2. Do you not feel if TCU and or Baylor beat another top 6 team it would have bumped them over tOSU?"
CFB,3dzyou,fuckqueens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"Baylor and TCU are practically guaranteed to both be in the southern division of this hypothetical conference, while Kansas State would be in the north. Baylor had the head to head over TCU, so we likely would have seen Baylor vs. Kansas State as the final matchup.  Going into December 6th. TCU was 3rd, Baylor was 6th and Kansas State was 9th. After TCU beat Iowa State and Baylor beat Kansas State, Baylor was 5th, TCU was 6th and Kansas State was 11th. Baylor beating Kansas State only moved them up one spot. Baylor beating Kansas State a second time in back to back games would not help Baylor climbing. TCU beating Kansas State a second time might help TCU undo the three teams jumping them out of nowhere.  And if TCU or Baylor beat another top 6 team that wasn't each other then sure, one of them could have made playoffs. However if its Baylor vs. TCU in this hypothetical rematch and Baylor beats TCU for a second time then that tells us nothing new. If TCU beat Baylor then we now have our two top teams each having losses to each other and neither one is the proven better team."

In the BCS Era Nebraska didn't need to win their Conference Championship Game to go to the National Championship Game.  Alabama either.  Oklahoma either.  Any of the Big 10 throughout the 2000s, any of the PAC throughout the 2000s.    What it DID do was prevent K-State, Missouri, Texas, and a few others from going to the NCG when they were upset in the Conference Championship Game.  It seemed to be a potential pitfall with no upside other than ""hoping"" a loss is ignored.    Sure the title ""One True Champion"" was a stupid idea, especially as that year and 2 years before were split Championships.  However, don't act as if the 10 team format is defunct in the Playoff.  The Conference Championship didn't matter numerous times in the past, it won't matter numerous times going forward.

CFB,3dy49y,_edd,3,Tue Jul 21 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. However, CCGs should be weighted as if they are just another game against a good team. Let's say two teams win their conference, team A has 4 quality wins and team B has 3 quality wins (one of which is in a CCG), then team A still has the more impressive record IMO."
CFB,3dy49y,jschroeder01,6,Mon Jul 20 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"Of course.  In that situation Team B would have had 2 less quality wins without the CCG as well.  I don't think it hurts a team like Texas all that much because you guys have almost gone out of your way to schedule an additional marquee OOC game.  It hurts a team like Baylor, who needs an additional win due to pathetic OOC scheduling, the most."
CFB,3dy49y,_edd,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   Regarding evaluating CCGs, even if it were an equal amount of quality wins, and both teams won their conferences, but one team did so through a CCG (that was already accounted for as a quality win), then extra weight shouldn't be given to the the CCG beyond showing that the winner beat a quality opponent."

A Big 12 championship game in 2014 would have been Baylor vs K-State (Baylor and TCU would almost certainly be in the same division). Rematches in championship games have gone the other way (see 2001 Colorado vs Texas, which kept UT out of the BCS championship and somehow put Nebraska in). If Baylor does win it, then maybe we finally get to see the Oregon-Alabama matchup everyone's wanted to see (FUCKBAYLORCON2015). Or maybe Ohio State still gets in, that win over a good Wisconsin team was very impressive. In any case, TCU and Baylor could have avoided this entirely by just winning all their games.   The Big 12 is going to overreact and add two teams to get back up to 12, and the teams they add aren't going to bring enough value to the table. I see the Big 12 as stable until we get to within about two years of the GOR expiring (2025 I think), when someone (my bet is on KU or OU) is going to leave the conference and setoff a chain reaction of realignment (B12 becomes like the AAC, C-USA collapses)."

My understanding was that you should return a pretty sick defense and (as far as I was aware) have much the same offense. So you're saying it will be much the same offense with a potential boost at QB, and just as strong of a defense up front with a less experienced, but more talented secondary? And so by the end of the season, the team should overall be better?"
CFB,3e1ilf,elykl33t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:18 2015 UTC,I hope he has a $wagtastic season for y'all. BEAT THE GATORS
CFB,3e1ilf,USCgamecocks,4,Tue Jul 21 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"I think Louisville has a shot to do it. Their defense up front is always aggressive and they have some big games early in the year to prove themselves. Will Gardner having a full year will be essential, though, to them making a run. They lost a great man in the secondary, as well, in Holliman, but the pressure up front is one of those things that I believe helped create some of his INTs. For the most part, their schedule remains consistently tough, with an opening slate against Auburn, Houston, Clemson. Then they have a ""break"" game against Samford and then NCSU and FSU with a BYE between them. BC, Wake, Syracuse, and UVA should all be Ws for them. Pitt and UK are IMO a ""disguised"" tough way to finish the season, with PITT potentially pushing their way into the Top 25 late in the year and with UK being a bowl team this year.  Frankly, though, the most obvious answer of all these...is USC.  Utah has the potential, but I think they may find themselves maxed around 9 wins with at least one or two over good ranked opponents. I can't wait to watch Booker have another amazing year.  Ole Miss could hit 10 this year. Chad Kelly isn't anywhere near a proven option year, but who knows. You can't say for sure whether he's better or worse than Bo at this point in time.  KSU will be lucky to hit 8 wins this year, I'm seeing more 6-7.  Nebraska still has work to do with their completely new coaching staff and the loss of Ameer.  Duke will be good, but I have no idea, in truth, what to expect from them."
CFB,3e1ilf,Drunken_Wanderer,4,Tue Jul 21 06:47:38 2015 UTC,I think Duke loses too much to even stay at 9 wins let alone take a step forward. And they unfortunately don't have the talent in the ranks to stay there.
CFB,3e1ilf,happyflappypancakes,2,Tue Jul 21 11:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to see what happens with Duke. Not sure if people realize how much talent Duke lost after last year. I see them taking a slight step back talent-wise compared to what they were the last two years, then getting back towards that level next year or the year after.   Nevertheless, their schedule might provide them the opportunity to win 9 games again despite taking a step back in overall quality. At the very worst, they should be 3-1 in the OOC (very easily could go 4-0). They get GT at home and have a week off before VT on the road. They also get BC and Wake out of the Atlantic. Couple that with a potential mid or lower tier bowl game, and they could get back to 9-4, assuming the other Coastal teams don't all take big leaps forward compared to last year."
CFB,3e1ilf,Liquid_Hot_Megwa,3,Tue Jul 21 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"The loss of Ameer will hurt, but we are loaded at RB.  How Armstrong deals with the new offense is a much larger issue."
CFB,3e1ilf,sgrag,2,Tue Jul 21 11:09:33 2015 UTC,"The consensus here is that Reggie Bonnafon will end up starting as QB over Gardner. We lost a ton to the draft, but having the two Georgia transfers come into the secondary, backing up what should be one of the best D-Lines in the country. I think 10 wins is doable."

CFB,3e1ilf,dukeeaglesfan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"Utah is still an enigma for me. I absolutely did not expect 9 wins last season. It surprised pretty much everyone, especially after they lost to Wazzu to open conference play (fun fact, Utah has actually never started Pac-12 play with a win).  With expectations high entering this season, it'll be interesting to see how they perform. Was last year a fluke? If it wasn't, I think they can make a run at the division. The problem here is that their schedule is tough with road games against Oregon, USC, Washington and Arizona. To win the division, they'll need to go no worse than 2-2 there and even that might not be enough."

The Mormons passed through before Nebraska was Nebraska. In fact, the University of Utah (1850) is older than the Nebraska territory."

If he's so concerned about stuff like that, OK St can have him imo. No offense to the kid or anything, these are all rumors so take them with a grain of salt.

CFB,3e0t2r,Ron_Cherry,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"To speak to their strengths on offense outside of Watson, they're extremely well set with one of the best WR tandems in the ACC (and perhaps the country) in Scott and Williams, and Gallman is a good RB. But, obviously, my concern if I'm them is their entire OL, save for their Center who was a problem himself at times last year, IIRC. I think that a lot of their potential hype for success is looking at the returning offensive skill players with blinders to the outstanding issue of whether or not this brand new OL can protect as well as last year's did, and even last year's was somewhat questionable. These new guys all have to come in and play a full season now, with Battle probably being the best component they lost this past year. Also, seeing what happens to QBs who spend so much time off (with Golson), Watson won't have taken a snap until fall practice rolls around, I don't believe."

They replace 4 OL, but they'll have 3 SR's starting, 1 RS-So(4), and 1 true Freshman(5), at least from the depth chart I found.  Yeah a true freshman at LT will have a steep learning curve, but the kid is talented and I imagine my mid-season he'll be playing well.    The OL will get 3 weeks, with only 1 difficult game, before a BYE week.  I'm sure by the time they play ND the OL will have meshed.  Also helps they they have a very mobile QB.  Obviously if Watson goes down, I think most would agree the whole ""championship contender"" label kinda goes out the window.    The DL is about the same as the OL, the 4 starting DL on their depth chart are 2 RS-JRs, 1 JR, and 1 SR.  Not like they're throwing young guys to the wolves here.    They have 2 tune-up games before playing Louisville, they might struggle a bit early but the early BYE week will probably be really valuable to them making a run for the top spot in the Atlantic."

The final CFP rankings were released the next day, so Art Briles was in full on campaigning mode and really threw the conference that carried Baylor for two decades under the bus.  You can read a little more here if you'd like, but I'll include some quotes.   ""I'm not obligated to [Bowlsby]. I'm obligated to Baylor University and our football team,"" Briles said. ""And we just happen to be a part of the Big 12. And we happen to be the champion two years in a row. So they need to be obligated to us, because we're helping the Big 12's image in the nation.""   Really came off as entitled here and like they didn't want to be part of the Big 12.   You know, if you're going to slogan around and say there's 'One True Champion,' all the sudden you're gonna go out the back door instead of going out the front?"" Briles said. ""Don't say one thing and do another.""   I definitely agree with this point, but the league rules specifically stated that the two teams would be co-champions. No-one was intentionally shunning Baylor. The whole issue came around am idiotic slogan created by marketing that multiple people should have shot down before it ever got to Bowlsby.   ""If I'm the commissioner of a league, then these universities are his kids, I would think. And so you love 'em all the same, but sometimes you have to differentiate between who you present as one or two,"" Briles said. ""That was kind of the gist of the conversation. I mean, don't go public and say that we're going to present as co-champs if our bylaws say head-to-head determines who goes into a bowl game if neither one of us are in the top four.""   No Briles, you're bylaws say that y'all are co-champs. Read the fucking rules Briles and stop shitting on you conference.  Besides that he's a great coach with unique mannerisms. They border somewhere between eccentric and redneck though and a lot of outsiders judge him solely off of that and ignore that he really is a great coach."
CFB,3e177l,ou77-am0,5,Tue Jul 21 06:18:36 2015 UTC,"Shoot, I missed these quotes.   I keep telling myself ""maybe you're just being biased, relax and re-evaluate the guy.""  And then he ends up annoying me even more."
CFB,3e177l,_edd,4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:19 2015 UTC,"I really want to like him. He built a program out of absolutely nothing and made a successful transition from HS coach to collegiate coach. As a personal bonus, a kid that I played football with for 6 years ended up being a very significant contributor to that team (and I know the kid got passed over by a lot of the larger schools), so I respect the hell out of Briles for a lot of the things he's done.  And still, Briles pisses me off with the shit he says."
CFB,3e177l,ou77-am0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Same here. In spite of the fact that Baylor annoys the shit out of me, I liked him doing what he's done at Baylor.  And then he opens his mouth and I want to go club a baby seal."
CFB,3e177l,murgle1012,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"So you're mad at him for campaigning in favor of his team? Ok....   Seriously, though. Coach Briles thought it was a stupid strategy by the conference, and was trying to get the committee to vote for his team. Or he was venting. Or he was just trying to get Baylor in the news more to spread awareness. But Jesus, this sub treats him like he drowns puppies and calls POWs cowards."
CFB,3e177l,_edd,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not mad at him for campaigning for his team, but I was mad at him for throwing his conference under the bus while campaigning.    Coach Briles thought it was a stupid strategy by the conference, and was trying to get the committee to vote for his team.    The rule had been in effect for the entire season. It hadn't been a strategy since the summer before at the latest. Briles gave the impression that the conference was opting to fuck Baylor over when it was simply that Baylor had failed to win the conference outright.  And I didn't say he's some evil reincarnate. I respect a lot of the things he's managed to do as a coach, and I get that he had to campaign for his team. That doesn't excuse him from shitting on his conference."
CFB,3e177l,CLANGACLANGACLANGA,4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:16 2015 UTC,I love any coach who has top shelf footwear swag and refers to his inferiors as the compass point schools they are.

I think we generally do like coaches with attitude or who say stuff other than what their SID told them. I just don't think we (/r/cfb collectively) like Art Briles all that much.   I really fucking dislike him because he coaches my rival. If Art Briles coached some PAC12 school (or something) that I don't hate with a rage that makes me shoot blood from my eyes, I'd probably be a huge fan.

I think he's a great recruiter, and a great coach who's had the weird luck of being at Wisconsin and Arkansas. Both are difficult jobs that don't exactly sell themselves like your school.   On to the rules, I don't think he wanted to ban anything in particular, I think he had a misinformed opinion on the HUNH, but since has backed way down on this.   Can you blame a man for leaving for more money and a more prestigious position, honestly?"
CFB,3e177l,james_wightman,0,Tue Jul 21 06:38:28 2015 UTC,"I think he wouldn't have made 2 of those Rose Bowls without the NCAA doing him a massive solid.  He should send them fruit baskets.  He did want to ensure that at least 10 seconds focused between every snap because it's very difficult for the teams he likes to build to play at that tempo for long and his teams wear down.  To be fair that was Saban's thing but it irritated me that he jumped on it too.  I don't blame him for leaving, I just don't like Bielema.  It doesn't help that Wisconsin lost those three Rose Bowls and we had to hear about how weak the Big Ten was even more because of that."
CFB,3e177l,Wmdalford,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"No one had a problem with Briles for having an attitude. Patterson, Stoops, Gundy, etc. all have character quirks. The problem is that he decided that after being a flaming bag of shit program for decades (its not personal BU fans, I actually like you all very much), three solid seasons meant Baylor deserved to be carried on a golden throne for winning the conference. I don't remember OU, Texas, OKSt or K-State demanding special treatment that went against conference rules when they were winning conference championships."

Spurrier is usually funny, witty, and light hearted. He may take a lot of digs but its things like, ""Can't spell Citrus without UT"" and stuff like that. Briles just says, ""You hear what A&M is thinking about doing? They're building a lake. We're making people change their game."" It comes across more conceited and not as humorous.

UNC makies the most sense there, given their cachet and prominence as a public institution and their existing precedent in basketball, but the academic scandal that they're embroiled in could hamstring them. Duke has similar advantages, but with the small downside of being a private school and having a more miserable history in football. NC State has potential if theor administration decides to go all in. Wake...yeah, I mean they're great.  I think one or both of the Arizona schools could very well be on an Oregon-like trajectory. They are massive public schools in warm weather, and they both have solid coaches who have them on a steady upward track. I could definitely see either of them taking off in the future.  UCF has undergone a major transformation over the past 20ish years, from an overlooked commuter school to a massive public school with thriving undergrad population, gorgeous modern campus, and major academic improvements, particularly in STEM fields. They're also definitely buying in on their athletics. I was on their campus last summer, got to see their athletic facilities and they were very good.

CFB,3e066t,ou77-am0,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:50 2015 UTC,I see us getting between 7-9 wins this year but come 2016 with how much we'll lose we very well may not go bowling in 2016. So we maybe better this year but we won't see consistent success just yet.

CFB,3e066t,ou77-am0,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:01 2015 UTC,Skill positions will be fine on offense the oline worries me. Secondary should be good plenty of young guys and depth there. Linebackers I'm really not sure on. Dline we are getting some young guys in but it's still far from were it needs to be. 2016 defense could be similar to the 2014 defense. Hopefully Gibbs can do more with that than our other guys did.

No direct offense intended, as I root for Duke and Cutcliffe to do well...    Did you get rid of the track yet?    Even a smaller but nicer looking stadium would do a lot to increase the perception of the team's success. Similar to the new MLS stadiums that are being built."

Even after he left UVA was an ACC threat and nationally respected until about 2005. A decade later and UVA has lost all of that cachet."

CFB,3e066t,willOTW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"Kansas is a state full of people that are sports nuts. It's extremely rare to run into a person who doesn't care and/or have an opinion on sports. If the success of Sporting Kansas City and soccer in Kansas City and the rest of the metro area, and North East Kansas (they are one of the most supported franchises in MLS) tells me anything, it's that people in Kansas can root for any sport, and will root passionately, as long as they are given a decent to good team to root for. I'm excited to see what Beaty can accomplish. If he can start getting 6 to 8 win seasons consistently, watch how quickly people will flock to support the team. I understand that it's getting to that point that's difficult, but I think a lot of people underestimate how big the fan base is, and how much passion they have. If we can get a decade of 6-8 win seasons, with maybe a chance for more, I think KUs program will turn around. And possibly for good."

CFB,3e066t,Hougie,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that subjective.  The past decade was fallout of the sexual assault allegations, no names were ever named and nothing criminal ever became of it. The school cracked down on recruit visits so CU didn't get good recruits. The last AD didn't care about sports so he let everything get out dated. Then comes Rick George who makes it a priority.

I could find articles that say the same things about Seattle or one of our endless shitty suburbs, doesn't make it any less of an opinion.  You could list the million changes. There are other programs that have overcome worse sanctions and ADs than Colorado. The past decade and a half shows that Colorado has a problem getting quality coaches. It's a known issue that Colorado's cap on assistant coach salary has been troublesome before.  If Colorado has these million+ upsides, why did they hire Coach MacIntyre who has 1 winning season in his head coaching career? He couldn't have been the first choice. His salary ranks 10/12 in the conference and Colorado has the lowest assistant coaching salary pool in the conference."

The Athlon notes on Texas are depressing (these predictions were made before the dismissals).    If David Ash can stay healthy — a big if — Texas could compete for a league title. The Longhorns should be strong on the offensive line and have a nice stable of running backs."

I know there's several factors that play into the difficulty of repeating, and Urban and Jimbo differ greatly in the type of culture they've instilled (at this point in their careers). This just accounts for a portion of the issues that can come up."
CFB,3dybno,Hanchan,15,Mon Jul 20 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see the culture of the program having anything to do with this, nor does my opinion of Urban Meyer as a person.

CFB,3dybno,Snops1017,3,Mon Jul 20 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, making back to back runs relies on luck more than anything, as a bad injury or bounce can flip a game from a win to a loss, which can be the difference in going to the championship or not."

CFB,3dz404,quacainia,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who used to run a pretty detailed college football AND college basketball website, its a good start. Just keep in mind that it takes a lot of time and effort to get these things off the ground. The graphs are a nice touch, something I was never able to do.  I no longer run my sites, but they are archived here:  Football - http://web.archive.org/web/20140108194605/http://www.cfbsheets.com/2013/main.html Basketball - http://web.archive.org/web/20140304201231/http://www.cbbsheets.com/20132014/main.html  The football website will look weird because the .css file isn't archived, but you will get the general idea of what the site was about.  Why did I shut down? I no longer had an avaliable free/cheap source of play-by-play data for football. Since I had no complete data set, I had no way to continue to generate my numbers and saw no point in keeping the site up and paying for the hosting. Basketball wasn't(and still wouldn't be) a problem, as I only use box scores for my basketball numbers and had no need for play-by-play data, but I didn't feel like keeping up the site for just my basketball numbers.   I had someone reach out to me and connected me with a person who can feed me football play-by-play data, so I may be able to relaunch for this season but it would take a lot of work to retrofit my system into using the new data source so its not 100% certain yet.  I think the most important thing is that you have a direction on what you want to do. My goal for my football website was for it to be the KenPom of football, and I feel like it accomplished that. It was literally a warehouse of data and logs. My basketball site's goal was to be a KenPom website that wasn't behind a paywall, and I feel like I accomplished most of that, really only missing the play-by-play win probabilities that his site has, and even added some features he didn't have like box score projections for team and individuals. It's important to find your niche. There are dozens of websites out there with general stats, and I felt it would be a waste of time to simply mirror those sites, so I decided to only focus on data and features that CAN'T be easily found elsewhere. I also focused strictly on numbers and ease of use, which is why my site looked very basic. Also why I chose never to put ads on it, for me it was just a hobby that I liked to share with others, and not a way to make money. My site started as something I did privately when I lived in Las Vegas as I created a system for football/basketball to help me with my wagering, and on various forums and websites I would always reference my ""sheets"" which I then decided to make public.  Also these things take time. From early July 2012 to the beginning of the 2013 season in August, I probably invested about 3-4 hours a day during the week and my entire weekends to get my football site ready for the 2013 season. For me it was just a fun hobby and a way to get an edge on gambling. You have to have passion and a purpose behind it otherwise it won't be a good product."
CFB,3dz404,ncaahoopsanalyst,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I was definitely trying to focus on more graphical representation of data since I don't have the know-how to make something quite like kenpom. Not to mention, everyone likes numbers, but sometimes they're not as easy to understand as images, and so far there's not a good go-to place for infographics of a team's performance.  The only reason I would want Ads or something is to pay for the data. I already have a pretty cheap deal for my hosting site, and I was paying for that anyway. I'd just need a new domain. Data can be expensive though, especially if you want to run with live data.  And yeah it does come down to time and effort. And while I have no job, I only have so much time.   If you can help me with a data source though, that would be awesome. That's my biggest fail point right now."

CFB,3dy6yw,jayhawx19,21,Mon Jul 20 20:58:42 2015 UTC,So 1 day of full speed practice a week?
CFB,3dy6yw,No_Way_Pablo,-10,Mon Jul 20 14:35:33 2015 UTC,two days of helmet on helmet full contact per week
CFB,3dy6yw,jayhawx19,35,Mon Jul 20 14:36:14 2015 UTC,including games
CFB,3dy6yw,No_Way_Pablo,7,Mon Jul 20 14:37:04 2015 UTC,Well yeah. There are a lot of weeks until the season starts and bye weeks that there will be two practices.
CFB,3dy6yw,jayhawx19,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, and there are also bye weeks.  I totally understand the desire to limit contact to cut down on injuries, but I wonder how this will affect the physicality of the conference.   Will it be more physical because players are more rested and not fatigued from practice, or will they be less physical because they don't practice physically? I guess we'll find out as more and more OOC games take place."
CFB,3dy6yw,No_Way_Pablo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the latter. I don't think fatigue was much of an issue to begin with. It will certainly be interesting to see, we were gonna suck either way."
CFB,3dy6yw,jayhawx19,6,Mon Jul 20 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think this will hurt as much as people think. You can always run full speed tackling drills with dummies and tackling sleds. Lineman can still push sleds. They can work on plays and procedures without full contact. There's very little you can't simulate with equipment, so if you knock the bulk of it down with that stuff, you can fit most of the remaining in on your ""everybody hit somebody"" day. There is always something you can work on in some way."
CFB,3dy6yw,TurboSloth9000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Ask any High School coach, the sled is 100x better for teaching run blocking technique than actual contact.  The contact is only to give the practice a test for how well you learned it and applied the techniques."
CFB,3dy6yw,I_Miss_Austin,13,Mon Jul 20 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"It will be interesting to see how coaches in the league adapt to this. In theory, tackling and blocking should be pretty automatic and players playing in the Big XII should have it down pat, and they do for the most part, but it still helps to have that extra day.  Still, I'm not sure it's going to be a major league difference or anything like that, and I like the idea of limiting full contact during the season as much as possible."
CFB,3dy6yw,nickknx865,17,Mon Jul 20 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"In theory, tackling ... should be pretty automatic and players playing in the Big XII should have it down pat   In practice, see Texas Tech"
CFB,3dy6yw,B0yWonder,16,Mon Jul 20 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"An issue we had with D in Brown's last years was missed tackles. Strong cleared it up but even college level athletes can lack the fundamental skills required to tackle.  That being said, I'm ok with this rule. I do worry about concussions."
CFB,3dy6yw,bullmoose_atx,4,Mon Jul 20 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"That the usual thought but it actually doesn't work like that. Tackling needs repetition and the difference is noticeable when a team doesn't practice their tackling. Weis, when he was at ND, ran many of his practices like NFL teams (meaning very little actual tackling) and his teams struggled hard during the season in that aspect. In 2010, in order to limit injuries on a low-depth team, Lane Kiffin had no tackling practices the whole year and the defense was awful. The next year he goes back to tackling and there was noticeable improvement. Maybe one less practice won't be as bad, but practicing tackling is critical."
CFB,3dy6yw,DrMoistPhappen,4,Mon Jul 20 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"In theory, tackling and blocking should be pretty automatic and players playing in the Big XII SEC should have it down pat,   LOL!"
CFB,3dy6yw,dupreesdiamond,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:11 2015 UTC,A tennessee fan saying tackling should be automatic? wow.
CFB,3dy6yw,ButchPlz,5,Mon Jul 20 23:00:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty smart. Once the season gets rolling, your goal for practice is to install new schemes and improve technique. Plus, it limits the chance of players getting injured in practice. I would imagine a lot of teams were already following a similar schedule anyway."
CFB,3dy6yw,chipoople,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"I know Oklahoma State is. I think Mike Gundy teams spend the least amount of full contact practice of any big 12 teams. They also never use all of their allotted practice time, which is really rare."
CFB,3dy6yw,OSUfan88,9,Tue Jul 21 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"While player safety is a huge issue, the players have to hit one another. In 50 years we may be looking at touch football but not yet. I feel like this over cautiousness could end up hurting just as much as too much contact."
CFB,3dy6yw,chuckthetruck64,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:06 2015 UTC,To be fair. I don't think to many teams run more than 2 full contact drills a week anyways. Coaches will probably just have to do some restructuring of their drills each week.
CFB,3dy6yw,notpauljohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:34 2015 UTC,Yeah probably. Even in high school we only had 2 full-contact practices a week.
CFB,3dy6yw,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"Ugh. My head hurts thinking about the full-contact two-a-days in August. Ten practices a week, full contact, as an offensive guard.  My coach was a dickface."
CFB,3dy6yw,uncomfortablyhigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:11 2015 UTC,I was a Guard/Tackle. It was never very fun. My Freshman and Sophomore years we had 4-a-days with 2 being full pads. We only did those for like a week but that was difficult.
CFB,3dy6yw,chuckthetruck64,5,Mon Jul 20 20:03:56 2015 UTC,Good. Player safety needs to be the #1 priority
CFB,3dy6yw,willOTW,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"At least it's league wide so the only games that might be affected are OOC. Not that major of an issue when health is the benefit, OU's lost good players before due to practice injuries and concussions. I'm okay with this rule."
CFB,3dy6yw,voltron818,6,Mon Jul 20 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Good. As our information regarding the medical effects of football evolve, so should the rules which govern it. Like every society to ever exist, knowledge begets progress."
CFB,3dy6yw,uncomfortablyhigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:49 2015 UTC,"Meh. I doubt if this really hurts the Big XII. Especially because no one does more than 3 contact practices a week anyway. Idk what one more day of hitting would do for you, and this will prevent injuries. That said, I've always been of the mind set that you have to practice like you play. You get hit in games, so you should get hit in practice. Not only that, but you are a football player. You should want to hit and be hit."
CFB,3dy6yw,SKyJ007,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"If you're serious these kids are students first, then I think this is a step in the right direction."

CFB,3dy664,UnreconciledAccounts,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"It seems extreme, but obviously it's more than a rock. Like what would happen is someone ripped a hole in the Mona Lisa?  It's just canvas and paint, but obviously more highly valued than that.  Also before I get people complaining about comparing the Mona Lisa and Howard's Rock, I'm just making the point that certain things carry more weight with history."
CFB,3dy664,MarcusDA,7,Mon Jul 20 16:03:53 2015 UTC,Toomer's Oaks were more iconic than Howard's Rock (IMO) and Harvey Updyke did less than a year

Then, the bus drives to the other side of the stadium at like ten MPH. ESPN dropped the ball by not having racing announcers there. Then, get this part, they climb out of the bus.    A few minutes later, they appear at the top of the hit, rub the rock, and run down the hill [in a scene that actually seems fairly cool]."

CFB,3dy664,Flavordaaaaave,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:26 2015 UTC,20 years in prison would seem insane for damaging the Mona Lisa as well.
CFB,3dy664,citronauts,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:43 2015 UTC,At some point you have to assign value to things that seem trivial to others.
CFB,3dy664,MarcusDA,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"No doubt the rock and ML have value, but that doesn't mean we should be sending people to prison for 20 years for damaging property.    Sentences in this country have gotten way too long over the past 40 years to fit particular crimes.   This guy obviously has some major problems to think it was a good idea to do what he did, but I guarantee you that if he even knew he could be convicted and sentenced to 5 years, he wouldn't have done it.  5 years in prison is still a really, really long time.  Just take your age, add 5 years to that and imagine all the things in life you would be missing.  20 years is so long you can't even fathom it.   This guy is a jerk, but 20 years is absurd."
CFB,3dy664,citronauts,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I even said originally that 20 years seems extreme. I don't disagree.   Besides it's up to 20 years, not what he's going to get. I'm pretty sure downloading a movie still carries like 30 years in prison as well theoretically."
CFB,3dy664,MarcusDA,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Coach Frank Howard himself thought the rock was trivial:   The coach used the rock as a doorstop until 1966. He was cleaning out his office when he told Gene Willimon, a Clemson booster, ""Take this rock and throw it over the fence or out in the ditch...Do something with it, but get it out of my office."" It was Willimon who had the rock placed on a pedestal in the east end zone, where it remains today.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard%27s_Rock"
CFB,3dy664,duckdownup,7,Mon Jul 20 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that's a stupid argument. That's part of the original story that adds to the value.  An Honus Wagner baseball card came in a cigar box and held no value, and now it's over $1m for a piece of cardboard.   Howard was fond of the rock and tradition later on: Then the Howard's Rock legend was officially born when the coach later told his team: ""Give me 110 percent or keep your filthy hands off of my rock."""
CFB,3dy664,MarcusDA,0,Mon Jul 20 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"Why the down vote? I was simply posting the history of the rock.

CFB,3dyang,goblue10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"Toledoan here. As a MAC school, we're used to coaches going to greener pastures. Nick Saban coached here for a year, and Gary Pinkel (Mizzou's coach) was here for 9. Honestly Beckman brought us back to MAC relevance and gave us 3 pretty good years. Most of us were kind of surprised when he left, since we weren't sure why a B1G program was interested in a ""pretty good"" MAC coach. That being said, we don't hold any ill will against him. If you've got a better opportunity take it. Seeing how Beckman' struggeled at Illinois we're perfectly fine with Matt Campbell."

CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,11,Mon Jul 20 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious to see what (if anything) the investigation turns up. At this point, all we have is Simon Cvijanovic's accusations from Twitter, and nothing new has come up since then, even when CNN did some digging around. Simon's rant always seemed a bit untrustworthy to me for a few reasons (copied from a previous thread):   He never brought up his concerns to the coaching staff, athletic administration, or university administration. They were all blindsided by the Twitter rant. He mentioned he spoke to lawyers and ""didn't really get anywhere with them."" He didn't make his rant until finals week. He quit the team in the fall and dropped out of school, but he had been re-admitted to school, and his degree was nearly in hand when he went off on Twitter. This was also just after he went unsigned at the NFL draft, which he blamed on the coaching staff. Simon was recruited by Zook, and that group of players referred to themselves as #Zookboys, even after 3 years under Beckman.  The only other players who backed him up were also Zook recruits. A couple of those guys redshirted a season, but were not given a 5th year of scholarship to play because they were buried on the depth chart, so they all presumably had an ax to grind with Beckman.   So all of that leads me to think it may be a case of sour grapes. But the issue of how to treat injured players is certainly important, and I hope the investigation gets to the bottom of it. If it turns out that Beckman tried to get Simon to play when the doctors/trainers had not cleared him, or the doctors/trainers were negligent in clearing him to play before he was ready, that's a serious problem and probably should result in firings. If medical staff cleared him to play, but he was still experiencing some pain, that becomes a much grayer area. A judgement has to be made how much longer a player can wait after being deemed medically able to play before he decides to just play through the pain. It'll be interesting to hear the investigation's results, though I doubt we'll get much detail since players' medical histories are involved."

He's not bad in zone coverage, but he's got weaknesses.  And, yes, Dudek. If he can make it back in October, that's going to be huge. But if he can't make it back until November, I'd rather he redshirted and save a year of eligibility. Sophomore Dudek < 5th year Senior Dudek."

I've heard many of your fans say that they consider Michigan to be a rival, yet no Michigan fans will say that Illinois is a rival. Why do many of your fans consider Michigan to be a rival?  In 2008, Illinois represented the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl. What does Illinois need to do to get back to that level of competitiveness in the Big Ten?  Tim Beckman has taken Illinois from 2-10 to 4-8 to 6-7 in his first 3 years. Do the Illini improve further this season, stay the same, or regress, and is Tim Beckman still your coach in 2016?  Toledo Fans:  Last season, Toledo earned a share of the MAC west title, but did not earn the trip to Detroit as Northern Illinois won the tie breaker. What does Toledo need to do in order to win the MAC west outright and earn a trip to Detroit this season?  Matt Campbell is going into his 4th year as coach of the Rockets, and has posted a 26-13 record as the head coach there. If Toledo has another season like last season this year, how likely is it that he takes a job elsewhere?

CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,4,Mon Jul 20 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"The Illinois - Michigan ""rivalry"" really comes from the late 70's early 80's when Gary Moeller was hired as Illinois' coach. He performed...poorly in three seasons and was fired. This upset Bo who was a mentor to Gary for a number of years and Bo made it his mission to try and embarrass Illinois every chance he got after the firing. Mike White was a solid coach for Illinois which made for some interesting games in the 80's. No Illinois fan really considers Michigan a rival outside of the normal ""haves and have nots type of situation""  Regarding the Rose Bowl its pretty clear that was a fluke year. If Ohio St wasn't playing in the NC game we wouldnt have been there anyway. i think Illinois fans crave stability more than anything right now.

CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"Students are very upset that The Chief is gone, but I think that sentiment is dissolving as new students arrive on campus who may have been too young to remember just how important of a symbol he was to U of I. However, at every Illini sporting event, people still chant ""Chief"" and fold their arms in the manner he did when he performed, so the tradition is not dead. I think we have a fledgeling rivalry in basketball, but certainly not football. I think many Illini fans consider Michigan a rival more because the schools are so close academically rather than athletically.  We have to win. Simple as that. I really think a new coach (preferably one with deep ties to the Chicago area and the south) would liven up the Illini spirit and make kids want to come here. It's been nothing but a circus since Beckman got to Champaign.  I think Illinois regresses this year and Beckman is fired after losing his 7th game because this season's schedule is tougher than last year's and our star WR is out for the beginning of the season and the QB situation is iffy at best."
CFB,3dyang,uiucrower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:58 2015 UTC,There is still a lot of pro-Chief sentiment. I wouldn't expect any change as long as Phyllis Wise has any say in things. It'd probably take a lot of people saying they're willing to donate a lot of money for her to change her mind.
CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"The majority of students favored the Chief, so it was a pretty big deal when he was retired. There was a lot of anger at the NCAA (shocker!) because we felt that they basically forced the decision on us. There's still a group on campus that supports the Chief, and they have talked of bringing him back, though I don't know how big it is. Supposedly the Peoria tribe (the last remaining relation to the ""Illini confederation"" of indian tribes) was willing to work with the school to bring him back in a more respectful way, but the chancellor has shot down that idea. I'm not on campus now, so I don't know how current students feel, but in retrospect I'm of the opinion that retiring the Chief was the right decision, and he should not be brought back. The ""Michigan rivalry"" is kind of weird to me too, to be honest. I think it stems from Illinois not really having a true rival in conference, and Michigan's historic success making them one of the more hateable teams in the conference. Illinois' history is strange in that we've had a couple seasons of big peaks surrounded by even bigger valleys. The 2007 season was a perfect storm of some upperclassmen making senior leaps and instant impact recruits. Beckman's recruiting is nowhere near Zook's with respect to 4 and 5 star kids (though Beckman's is more balanced and fills position needs better than Zook). So for Beckman to get to the Rose Bowl, I think he needs to sustain modest success (consistent 7-8 win seasons) to convince recruits that Illinois is a legitimate destination for college football, and start pulling in higher ranked kids. Then maybe a Rose Bowl would be in reach every once in a while. That's a long term plan. Or, maybe Beckman gets fired this year and we hire somebody who can recruit the instant impact players and they combine with Beckman's foundation and go to the Rose Bowl a couple years from now. I think this year defense will be improved, but offense will struggle. The schedule is tougher, as the likely losses (OSU, Wisconsin, and Nebraska) are at home, and the more winnable games (Iowa, Penn State, Purdue, Minnesota) are on the road. It's possible the team is better, but the record is the same or worse. If the record is worse, I see no way Beckman is back. 6-6 is a close call to me, depending on the eye test. 7-5 or higher, and he's likely back. We'll need to win 3 noncon games, beat Northwestern at Soldier field, then win a couple road games or pull a couple big upsets to get there."
CFB,3dyang,uiucrower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"The NCAA didn't technically force the Chief's retirement on us, but they threatened any non-complying school with a ban on hosting postseason events in a similar matter to the sanctions they placed on South Carolina over the Confederate flag controversy. This would have screwed over all the non-revenue sports. Those post season events bring a lot of people from across the country to Champaign-Urbana, meaning that more than just the university would have been affected. We could have been stubborn and kept the Chief, but it was (and still is) a politically divisive issue."
CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,3,Mon Jul 20 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but without the NCAA mandate, the school probably would have just let the issue sit as long as it could. The school would continue to have open discussions about the Chief to placate the anti-Chief crowd and make them feel like they're being heard, but they knew that he was such a popular symbol that removing him of their own accord would be an extremely unpopular decision with the majority of students and alumni. The NCAA mandate forced a decision to be made. Either they retire the Chief, or keep him and face the consequences (which was never a real option for all the reasons you listed). So I think that had the NCAA never banned native American imagery, there's a good chance the Chief would still exist. There were probably a lot of people within the University that wanted to retire the Chief, but didn't want to face the backlash from the campus community. The NCAA mandate gave them an easy out."
CFB,3dyang,uiucrower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"I disagree in principle with the NCAA's ban since it has little to do with college sports. They go around taking action on Native American imagery, religious freedom laws, and Confederate flags yet are slow to act on issues like academic violations and giving athletes proper compensation. The lack of compensation is precisely why there are so many one-and-done college basketball players. I don't see the university doing anything about the Chief unless the NCAA changes its mind or people come forward offering donations if the university restores the Chief. In all fairness, the university right now has bigger problems to deal with than the restoration of a beloved mascot."

We don't play them a lot but I really do respect the Spartans, they do college football the right way. ..Oh wait, you meant the other Michigan. My bad...  Beckman (or the next guy) needs to be consistent and always fill holes with upperclassmen. A roster of nothing but experience would be the nirvana. If we could become just like Wisconsin, I would be overjoyed.  Beckman will once again improve. When he restarted the program, it forced him to play underclassmen everywhere. Now, they're all playing together as upperclassmen. My bet: if Beckman gets through this season, those upperclassmen will help him keep his job until 2017."
CFB,3dyang,tylerbc,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"Illini, what would your 1-star Yelp review of Memorial Stadium be?"
CFB,3dyang,kjkjkjkjk,7,Mon Jul 20 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"The Memorial Stadium nachos are of infamously poor quality. The North Endzone (student section) is on an island, totally separated from the action. Also, it bothers me that it's so damn big. Did they really think 10000 students would show up every game or did they just not think about how bad an empty student section looks? The South Endzone (horseshoe) badly needs to be updated. That end of the stadium is still configured as if there was a track in the stadium, so there's about 20 yards of empty turf between the front row of those sections and the endzone. This section also looks especially bad from the outside. Under the balcony on the East side of the stadium there are pipes that drip water onto the seats it is gross and needs fixing. the camera angle for the tv broadcasts is too high/steep the red grange statue is beautiful, but on the walls of memorial stadium behind it there are security cameras and floodlights that totally ruin any picture you try to take of the statue. also the statue is surrounded by ugly fences, as if all of our bitter rivals are constantly trying to break in and vandalize it???  the West  EAST side of the stadium is a sidewalk and practice fields. i don't know how you could make it any more boring. we don't do enough to showcase how beautiful the stadium is! the colonnades give me chills every time, looking at the engraved names on each column. the outside of the stadium has these beautiful tall elaborate stone walls engraved with poems and dedications and you don't see them enough! i love memorial stadium, and i want it to be world class so badly. :("
CFB,3dyang,uiucrower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:53 2015 UTC,I think you might be referring to the east side. The west side is getting improvements to be a prime tailgating area. It's going to be called Grange's Grove.

CFB,3dyang,QuasarDota,4,Mon Jul 20 22:49:49 2015 UTC,"Somehow, we don't have any IRL. If I had to make a complaint it would be that the student section isn't connected to the rest of the stadium."
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:56 2015 UTC,What is the best video/article/web page that involves your team this off season?
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:47 2015 UTC,"The stories involving Illinois have been pretty negative this off season (some deserved, most overblown regarding the football team). What I did enjoy seeing some Illinois alumni (Tony Pashos) speaking out very strongly for the program. Despite recent failures there is a fairly large number of Illinois players in the NFL and that gives me some joy.   illiniboard.com is run by a small group of dedicated fans. The most visable is a contributor named Robert who does VERY indepth off season articles, including a 90 article breakdown of every individual rostered player. While its often looked through orange hued glasses as he is a true fan, it can be very informative and helps me feel a connection to the roster"
CFB,3dyang,bmcarth2,4,Mon Jul 20 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"Robert and Brumby on IlliniBoard.com is my bible. He is currently in the process of the 90i which ranks and discusses the 90 most impact players for this season. He also has great ""check the tape"" breakdowns after each game."
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"There's not much in terms of Illini-centered video, but this right here is the best pump-up we've got so far."
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:44 2015 UTC,Who is a player that has the most potential to have a breakout year?
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,6,Mon Jul 20 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"Get ready to see a lot of Josh Ferguson this year, especially catching the ball. I have a feeling our entire offense is going to revolve around him and getting him into space. He has the athletic ability to make a lot of sportscenter highlights"
CFB,3dyang,bmcarth2,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"Agree, he will be the focus of the offense especially with Dudek out early in the season. Wouldn't necessarily call it breakout since he was  the best athlete on the field last year, but he will be the go to guy as Wes settles in."
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"Malik Turner. (Although I could say DE Jihad Ward, I think Illini fans already know that he's one of our better defenders.) Turner's a sophomore WR with real good size (6'3"") and decent speed. With another year under his belt, and Dudek sitting for at least half the season, Turner's got the best opportunity of any one on the team."
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,2,Mon Jul 20 17:12:42 2015 UTC,Which opponent scares you the least? Why?
CFB,3dyang,inevitablescape,5,Mon Jul 20 15:02:51 2015 UTC,Kent State. They were 2-9 last year in the weak MAC East
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,4,Mon Jul 20 16:10:21 2015 UTC,Western Illinois. Illinois has never lost to a state directional school before (suck on that NIU) and Western tends to be one of the weaker ones
CFB,3dyang,StephBrownismywaifu,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:11:32 2015 UTC,Still the best team in the state.
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,4,Mon Jul 20 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"The Jordan Lynch team was the best team in the state that year. But please do not confuse one year of success with being the best team in the state. Despite being sub par the majority of the 2000s we are the only multiple BCS bowl attending, national championship winning, stylin, profiling, team in the state"
CFB,3dyang,StephBrownismywaifu,0,Mon Jul 20 21:49:07 2015 UTC,What have you done for me lately? The past is irrelevant to the discussion. We are right now the best team in the state even with an incompetent coach.
CFB,3dyang,Ketsuryuukou,3,Mon Jul 20 22:02:32 2015 UTC,You made the mistake of saying this in a tread full of Illinois fans.
CFB,3dyang,professorberrynibble,0,Tue Jul 21 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, we shared one opponent last year, and we beat them worse. Then we both got utterly pants'd by a CUSA team in a bowl game. We've both been to BCS bowls in the past decade, and it ended about the same."
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"Western Illinois and Kent State. But let's say we limit it down to B1G opponents: Purdue. And that's only because of their recent history. Having to play the Boilermakers on the road isn't going to help at all. All of our ""easier"" games are on the road. Purdue, Penn State, Iowa and Northwestern (neutral site) are all at least contestable games if played in Champaign. It's just a really tough schedule this year."
CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,0,Mon Jul 20 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone opponent on our schedule is a possible loss. I don't feel confident answering this question with utmost certainty. Northwestern is probably the most likely win for us, but they can be wily."
CFB,3dyang,byniri_returns,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:36 2015 UTC,What's the minimum record Tim Beckman needs to not get fired?   6-6?                7-5?
CFB,3dyang,bmcarth2,5,Mon Jul 20 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"I think 6-6 get him fired given the extracurriculars surrounding the program, and this year's schedule is much harder to make that happen.   If you get to 7-5 he can sell improvement from each year. Since we've gone from 2 wins, 4 wins, 6 wins, and then now 7."
CFB,3dyang,byniri_returns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Another more in-depth question about that,  Does Beckman survive either of:    7-6 (7-5 with bowl loss) 7-6 (6-6 with bowl win)   I'm assuming 8 wins in any way gets him a bit off the hot seat."
CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"A 6-6 regular season is right on the line for me where it depends on the eye test a little bit. If it's 6-6 like last year (only one solid win, five 4th quarter comebacks, and six non-competitive losses), he should probably be gone. If the 6-6 comes with solid wins and closer losses, that might be enough to keep him around. I'm not sure the bowl result will have much of an impact.  8 wins would get him a contract extension. His current contract only runs through 2016, so it would be helpful to have either a decisively good or bad season this year."
CFB,3dyang,bmcarth2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think in either scenario he survives. This program craves consistency which it hasn't had for a long time, either of those scenarios shows improvement.  8 wins would absolutely save him his job, but that's just not likely given our schedule."
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:04 2015 UTC,Yes. Seven wins hasn't happened in Champaign since 2011 and it would be a clear sign of growth. At least I would be happy.
CFB,3dyang,I-L-L,4,Mon Jul 20 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"General feeling around the program is that a bowl game is a MUST this year, without that he is gone. Its a pretty grey area after that because some are more inclined to say that even if we make a bowl game but are blown out in losses (like the 2014 season) that he will be gone regardless. Overall: bowl or bust."
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Good question. 5-7 and he's out. 6-7 (a loss in the bowl game) and it depends on the outcome of the offseason allegations. However, if the allegations do turn out to be completely true, his record won't matter at all."
CFB,3dyang,Spartan_Mello,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"Illinois fans, what are your thoughts on the jerseys you have had recently? It seems like Nike is breaking far away from tradition, and I wanted to know your opinions on them!"
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,5,Mon Jul 20 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"Tradition, Smadition. The only reason I used to like the old helmets (bold, italicized, and underlined: ILLINOIS) was mostly because that's all I knew, aka Stockholm Syndrome. And the piping on the jerseys were always weird.  The new stuff is an instant favorite. Those helmets (white and orange) are spectacular! The blue jerseys are supposed to be coming in this year and I can't wait to the see the classic orange-blue-orange combination."
CFB,3dyang,Serd95,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:50 2015 UTC,I love your new uniforms. I wish Nike went in the same direction with ours.
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,2,Mon Jul 20 19:40:40 2015 UTC,I actually really like yours. They do have a few things to iron out with some weird combinations and stuff. But Syracuse has more personality in football than I can ever remembering it having. You're on the up!
CFB,3dyang,Serd95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly they would be great if the numbers didn't look so weird. But you're right, it is good to have some personality. I used to have a plastic Syracuse helmet when I was a kid around when McNabb and Frenney played and I remember my friends would ask Me why I had a Browns helmet.  This new uniform trend and the arms race between schools to have the best uniforms has been good for college football. It's a lot easier for teams to have an identity now."
CFB,3dyang,nick12945,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:24 2015 UTC,The blue jersey looks awesome. I've always liked the orange/blue combo.

CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,3,Tue Jul 21 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"I really like our new uniforms. They incorporated alot of traditions into the unis that people who aren't Illini fans might not notice. They grey homecoming unis pictured above were a nod to Red ""Galloping Ghost"" Grange (grey for ghost) and the subtle striping on the jersey are a throwback to the unis worn from the 20s through the 40s. Nike made a big deal during the rebranding of including more ""Fighting Illini"" wording to all the school's uniforms, but that hasn't been shown other than the throwback unis the basketball team wore this past season (which were AMAZING!) http://d3f5994kvuwcz1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-20-at-2.06.51-PM.png"
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:20 2015 UTC,The benefit to the rebrand is that we didnt have a long tradition regarding uniforms anyway ( I mean before this rebrand its lets copy the NY Giants unifroms and just have Illinois underlined instead of Giants). Overall I think Nike did a great job considering we dont have a mascot or nickname with real symbolism outside of a block I. Our white stormtrooper uniforms are some of the nicest an Illinois team has fielded in a while.
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:13 2015 UTC,Who is the opponent that scares you the most this season? Why?
CFB,3dyang,inevitablescape,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:41 2015 UTC,Wisconsin because they were very good last year and they didn't really have a QB. I'm giving OSU the win already.
CFB,3dyang,lernington,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:05 2015 UTC,Can I say the entire schedule?
CFB,3dyang,uiucrower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:52 2015 UTC,I think they could go 3-1 in the OOC schedule. Big Ten play is where things get a bit more difficult.
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ohio State and Wisconsin? So far ahead of us it's not even funny. Nebraska? That's an upset waiting to happen, trust me. But most scared? Iowa. Illinois can beat this Iowa team. At least in Champaign. In Iowa City, it might tilt the field just enough that we walk out with a close loss. October 10th will tell you a lot about both teams."
CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:07 2015 UTC,Ohio State because they're preseason #1 and will probably destroy us.
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,5,Mon Jul 20 15:49:53 2015 UTC,Ohio State doesn't scare me because I've already accepted that as a loss. What scares me is Purdue because thats a game we actually need for bowl eligibility and they beat us at home last year
CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:23 2015 UTC,Very true.
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:19 2015 UTC,Is this team a bowl team? A conference championship team? A national championship team?
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"This is a bowl team. And that's without Dudek. As the season wrapped up in 2014, Illinois played some of its best football in years and now they're returning a ton of upperclassmen and skill players who will only improve from last year. It will come down to the last game with Northwestern, but I fully believe they can get to another bowl."
CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:08 2015 UTC,I think Illinois could squeak into a bowl game. I think it'll come down to the Northwestern game just like last year where the winner goes bowling.
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:33 2015 UTC,possible bowl team. If the defense can cause some turnovers and Dudek comes back healthy the second half of the season I have a good feeling about six wins
CFB,3dyang,lernington,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:11 2015 UTC,Maybe a bowl team if they can generate some cohesiveness
CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:45 2015 UTC,Which game defines your teams season?
CFB,3dyang,I-L-L,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:09 2015 UTC,I hope that this is NOT the case but I truly believe that our season and a bowl appearance will hinge on the game with Northwestern on the last weekend of the season. This is an important season because popular opinion is that the coaching staff needs a bowl to keep their jobs.
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"The game at Iowa. Illinois has improved enough that I think they could beat Iowa... in Champaign. If they truly have improved beyond the end of last season, they need to prove it by beating the Hawkeyes in a road game."

CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,2,Mon Jul 20 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, not good. As  the first game against real competition, I think our offense will have issues moving the ball in our first real test without Dudek. While I'm not projecting a blow out, the fact that its a road game will hurt and it will probably be our lone out of conference loss"
CFB,3dyang,patchkit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:48 2015 UTC,lol your offense won't have trouble moving the ball against our D

CFB,3dyang,LessGoooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic, but it will be our first true test of the season. If we can take the W, I feel very confident that Illinois could finish 7-5."

Will you defense improve any this year? It seemed both of ours were atrocious last year, but we expect the defense to improve this year while the offense may take a step back as it relies on Wes Lunt without Mike Dudek for the first portion of the season."
CFB,3dyang,travisun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, we got Gene Chizik and he is implementing the 4-3 over the 4-2-5."

I'm hoping we'll have a fairly solid defense - all upperclassmen with lots of experience and some decent players at each position, plus some good depth. Offense will probably struggle. O-line was not very good last year, and we may have a couple holes to plug this year. QB has a fantastic arm but struggled with decision making and injuries last year. Our top RB is very good both at rushing and receiving, but after him, it's a couple freshmen and a juco transfer competing for time. We lost our best receiver to an ACL tear, but should still have a couple decent options on the roster.  Basically, I'm hoping for a close game that we're able to pull out the win. But we never seem to do too well on our first road trip of the season, so it's hard to be too confident."
CFB,3dyang,travisun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:42 2015 UTC,"For us, our offense is our strength, we are projected to be one of the best offenses in the country."

CFB,3dyang,lernington,5,Mon Jul 20 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"If we could make him 20 or 30 years younger, Mike Ditka.  Though I kind of wish we had groomed J Leman to be a coach."
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,4,Mon Jul 20 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"Dear god no on J Leman. While a fantastic underdog story on the field he would try and ""faith heal"" our entire roster.

Sure fire NFL player if he didn't put his long term health above short term gain."

CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"umm.. In terms of connections to the program? ... uh.. maybe Mike Locksley..? (Maryland OC). He was with the team during the '07 run. That's the thing -- Illinois is been generally bad for quite a while and unable to build upon many successes.  Realistic Dream Coach: Justin Fuentes from Memphis. Dude knows how to build a program from the ground up, which is exactly what we need.  Unrealistic Dream Coach: Les Miles -- because he's getting tired of being at one spot for so long, right?"
CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"This is why I can't get too excited about the ""Fire Beckman"" talk. There's not a clear upgrade out there  that I'm confident would take the job, and I don't know of any with connections to the school. We'd either get another fired retread, another mid major coach with mediocre track record, or we'd have to severely overpay to get somebody with a good resume. Rumor has it we offered Sumlin the job 3 years ago, and he took less money to go to A&M.  One name I've heard with Illini connections (that would be a stretch hire) is Kirby Wilson. He's an alumni and is currently RB coach for the Vikings. The problem is, he's a career position coach who's never been a head coach.   The other name I've heard was PJ Fleck, who looks like a decent hire right now. He doesn't have any connections to the school, but he's from Illinois and went to NIU, so close enough?"
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"PJ Fleck would be the hire that would excite me the most. While I think Fuentes would be an improvement over the current regime, I feel like he would bolt Illinois for a higher tier job ASAP. PJ Fleck might actually look to build the program and see it through (unless a blue blood came calling which is understandable). Fleck has done a good job at WMU and could be the answer for a long term rebuild at Illinois"
CFB,3dyang,G_B_B_T,3,Mon Jul 20 18:31:42 2015 UTC,I'm not worried about a guy leaving for another school. That's a problem I'd like to have. Hire the best guy that will take the job and try to keep him as long as you can. Having a coach that's wanted by other schools is better than having to fire your coach every 5-7 years or so.
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"If that ""already-leaving"" coach can improve your team from the conference doormat to 8-4 for two years before he's gone, then yes, please, sign me up."

CFB,3dyang,TotalEconomist,0,Tue Jul 21 02:21:32 2015 UTC,Who will be your highest NFL draft pick this season? Where do you see him going?
CFB,3dyang,I-L-L,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"For the third draft in a row, there is a very high possibility that Illinois has no player selected in the draft. Regardless the player to watch is Jihad Ward. Aside from having the greatest first name in all of college sports, Jihad is a monster 6-6 300LB DE that has incredible speed and reach. It should be fun to see him eat up opponent offensive lines this season."
CFB,3dyang,Mavericklerk,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:51 2015 UTC,100% agree on Ward. He has all the measurables to work in the NFL. He spent last year learning how to play D-Line and was decisively better in the second half of the season. Really could be a bright spot on an overall mediocre to poor defense
CFB,3dyang,cardchief35,3,Mon Jul 20 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"Jihad Ward is the most likely, as /I-L-L said, but I'm also going to submit LB Mason Monheim. Of all returning B1G linebackers, he has the best tackles-per-game stat. He'll likely be a very late round pick, if anything, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him picked."

CFB,3dvq62,txstate10,75,Mon Jul 20 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Truth. Say what you will about VY not winning the Heisman, but when it came to crunch time he would. not. let. you. lose. His play was on another level from the rest of the CFB world in both the 2005 and 2006 Rose Bowls.   And you can also say what you will about Tebow and Newton and their excellent, distinguished careers (and I'm not taking anything away from them because they WERE excellent) but both of them were brought down to Earth a bit in their respective NC title games and were helped out by the talent around them. VY was nothing like that, he would just take over the game and play absolutely flawlessly. I still remember one play in the 2006 Rose Bowl, the play broke down and VY ran right at USC's defensive end Frostee Rucker. Rucker tried to take VY down and bounced right off of him. And Young made it look effortless, he just shook off this 300-lb guy and kept running until 4 or 5 Trojans brought him down.   Edit: Here's the play in question."

CFB,3dvq62,ravindra69,13,Mon Jul 20 04:00:20 2015 UTC,Older friends played against him in HS(KATY). Jumped 5-10 yards out of bounds threw it across his body 50 yards for a TD. Can't even be upset. Just impressed.
CFB,3dvq62,txstate10,19,Mon Jul 20 02:50:39 2015 UTC,Jumped 15 - 30ft huh?
CFB,3dvq62,auth0r_unkn0wn,4,Mon Jul 20 11:17:01 2015 UTC,15 ft isn't really a lot for an athletic guy.
CFB,3dvq62,mking22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:00 2015 UTC,When you're throwing a damn football across your body it is
CFB,3dvq62,fedale,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:53 2015 UTC,I'd say there are many NFL QBs who can throw the ball 50 yards from their knees. We're talking about one the greatest athletes to ever play the QB position.
CFB,3dvq62,mking22,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"15 feet is 5 yards... VY had a stride that was like 4.5 yards, so to jump a half extra foot isn't asking much."
CFB,3dvq62,I_Miss_Austin,0,Mon Jul 20 13:01:34 2015 UTC,"15 feet is 5 yards... VY had a stride that was like 4.5 yards, so to jump a half extra foot isn't asking much.   Is that Texas math you're using? If his stride is 4.5 yards and you said that he jumped 5 yards out of bounds...that means that he jumped an extra foot and a half, not half a foot. 1 yard equals 3 feet, so half a yard equals 1.5 feet."
CFB,3dvq62,Evil_lil_Minion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:55 2015 UTC,It's early and no coffee yet :(  I don't math so good.
CFB,3dvq62,I_Miss_Austin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:14 2015 UTC,15 feet out of bounds though and simultaneously throwing a pass across his body 50 yards?
CFB,3dvq62,auth0r_unkn0wn,2,Mon Jul 20 13:10:15 2015 UTC,I'm not verifying his story on the whole cross body out of bounds 50 yard throw... just 15 yard jump isn't that much for him.
CFB,3dvq62,I_Miss_Austin,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that a 5 yard jump isn't that far, if he's jumping in the direction he's running.  However, he probably wasn't headed straight for the sidelines and, if he was, there's no way he then could've thrown the ball 50 yards.  Let alone across his body and while in the air no less.  Furthermore, op said 5 - 10 yards so the 15ft jump was on the low end.    I admit that VY is a BAMF but this story seems like a gross exaggeration"
CFB,3dvq62,auth0r_unkn0wn,4,Mon Jul 20 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"Whenever someone gives an estimation, I always take the low end... seriously 10 yards out of bounds on a HS Stadium is on the track which means he had to jump over the benches and through the other team on the sidelines.    Also I watched Vince his Freshman year playing... I don't think he could hit a 35 yard pass that year."
CFB,3dvq62,I_Miss_Austin,6,Mon Jul 20 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""bounced"" off... But he juked him dead"
CFB,3dvq62,galingstat,3,Mon Jul 20 05:51:30 2015 UTC,"There is nothing ""great"" about that play.  I think he may have been using a lot of Hyperbole in remembering how that actually took place."
CFB,3dvq62,nofx1978,6,Mon Jul 20 09:10:44 2015 UTC,"Honest question.    What is great about that play?  He ran up the middle and slightly juked Rucker.  You will see that same exact run by any semi-mobile QB in any game during the season.    I swear I am not trying to be a dick.  I just see anything that is incredible about what Vince did.    Edit: Vince did things in that game that were unbelievable, I just don't see that play as one of them."

CFB,3dvq62,dougiefresh00,2,Mon Jul 20 13:10:17 2015 UTC,"'Juke' implies he made him miss. Rucker had both arms around Young and hit him pretty hard, Young just ran right through it (the tackle)."
CFB,3dvq62,dariya_dil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think Vince Young is the single, sole reason Mack Brown was ever considered an elite coach at any given point in time."

CFB,3dvq62,Lionsault,23,Mon Jul 20 12:31:18 2015 UTC,It was until Oklahoma vs. Boise State happened.
CFB,3dvq62,Monkeyfeng,99,Mon Jul 20 01:10:47 2015 UTC,"That was the greatest ending, but game? That was beyond a doubt Texas vs USC. People forget that the Boise game wasn't really that competitive until the fourth quarter when Oklahma rallied back and we had the amazing finish. The Rose Bowl on the other hand was that same level of intensity for the entire game. It was three plus hours of excitement set to 11, Fiesta Bowl was three quarters of 6 and one quarter of 20."
CFB,3dvq62,njm1314,-7,Mon Jul 20 01:47:20 2015 UTC,You're not wrong but the ending to BSU was better.  But you're not wrong that Rose Bowl can be considered the best ever.  I just think the epic storyline for BSU was better overall in general.
CFB,3dvq62,Monkeyfeng,22,Mon Jul 20 01:52:03 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I said the ending was better. Just not so much better that it overshadowed the better total game. Because that Vince Young final drive was pretty damn close in terms of amazing."
CFB,3dvq62,njm1314,24,Mon Jul 20 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"When you take into account it was a national championship, VY being denied the heisman, the 2 yard stop of 4th down and the last 3 Texas drives, it is very difficult to argue it wasn't the greatest football game ever witnessed. Not even mentioning the fact USC was being talked about as the greatest cfb team ever. What they did in that game was as good as it gets. The Cinderella ending for the Boise game was incredible, but the UTvsUSC was absolutely magnificent. Pay no attention to my user name, I am clearly not biased."

CFB,3dvq62,Lansdallius,36,Mon Jul 20 07:35:25 2015 UTC,"Probably the only time I was ever able to root for Texas. ESPN just would not shut up with the ""GREATEST TEAM EVAR"" noise about USC leading up to that game. It was probably the best game I've seen to date, though."
CFB,3dvq62,trojanlaker,13,Mon Jul 20 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"That's funny because leading up the the previous season's BCS Championship Game, Larry Birdine wouldn't shut up about how overmatched the Trojans were"
CFB,3dvq62,Lansdallius,5,Mon Jul 20 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you guys beat the stuffing out of us the year before. That game hurts to think about, but you guys were stacked."
CFB,3dvq62,Pikachu1989,2,Mon Jul 20 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"I remember right before the Rose Bowl that ESPN was trying to pit the 1995 Nebraska team vs the 2005 USC team and they said the 2005 USC team would beat 1995 Nebraska. Fuck, I was rooting for Texas to win the National Championship just to shut them the fuck up about USC being a new dynasty team."
CFB,3dvq62,guinness_blaine,2,Mon Jul 20 08:09:23 2015 UTC,"Alright, that's insane. 95 Nebraska is just an unreasonable level of talent. That's the year they didn't give up a single sack, right?"
CFB,3dvq62,Pikachu1989,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, that was the year our offense was fucking unbelievable."
CFB,3dvq62,flyingcrayons,16,Mon Jul 20 15:50:53 2015 UTC,I made it through the one about Reggie miller I think I'll make it through this one. To be quite honest I don't really remember much about the game other than the last few drives. Definitely will be cool to get a closer look at the game and all the storylines behind it.
CFB,3dvq62,SpeedxKills,28,Mon Jul 20 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"To be quite honest I don't really remember much about the game other than the last few drives.   I have the opposite problem, I can't forget half the things that happened in that game that would've changed the outcome and they still make me rage to this day. The stupid Bush lateral, Young's knee being down on the TD, going for it on 4th down. And worst of all everyone in the stadium knowing Vince was going to scramble on that 4th down play and yet Frostee Rucker and Josh Pinkard still gave up contain. I feel like that image of Young going past our out of position defenders is still burned into the back of my eyelids. Ugh, I don't think I can watch this 30 for 30, living through it once was bad enough."
CFB,3dvq62,ElGuapo50,5,Mon Jul 20 00:55:39 2015 UTC,"For me the worst was when Dwayne Jarrett scored SC's last TD to make the lead double digits--in my mind--it. Was. Over.  The LenDale 4th down call was brutal too. Felt like the hole might've been there and certainly in hindsight the call could've been something to at least get Texas to have different personnel in the game or force them to shift or at least wonder what was coming, but Bush off the field and LenDale on a power left? Man..."
CFB,3dvq62,KenTrojan,8,Mon Jul 20 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"The 4th and 2 to Lendale White seems arrogant in hindsight. It worked all game long so it definitely was the right call, but as you said, there should have been some motion or maybe have Reggie split out wide."
CFB,3dvq62,ElGuapo50,13,Mon Jul 20 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"What's amazing to me is that as decorated as Pete Carroll's coaching career has been, he's a cumulative 48 inches or so from another National Championship and Super Bowl Championship."
CFB,3dvq62,KenTrojan,12,Mon Jul 20 02:26:40 2015 UTC,Yup. The similarities between Carroll's coaching careers at USC and Seattle is nuts. Blowout championship victories followed by heartbreaking losses.
CFB,3dvq62,flyingcrayons,4,Mon Jul 20 02:28:52 2015 UTC,fair enough. I was 12 years old when that game happened which definitely contributes to me not remembering all the details. I remember being allowed to stay up late to watch it because it was a school night and I had my heart ripped out.
CFB,3dvq62,auth0r_unkn0wn,4,Mon Jul 20 01:02:50 2015 UTC,Literally one of the worst nights of my life.  My gf was a USC senior and it was the beginning of the end of our five year relationship. I have to imagine the emotion of the game is what forced out a lot of things we said to each other afterward.  That game man.  Fuck!

CFB,3dvq62,BG1234567,3,Mon Jul 20 04:54:59 2015 UTC,"Whoa same, my dad made me go to sleep after USC took their double digit lead. I was way into USC and Reggie Bush that year and was heartbroken and very angry at my dad when he told me what happened the next morning."
CFB,3dvq62,TX_LoneStar,11,Mon Jul 20 05:16:52 2015 UTC,Vince Young was insane in that game. One of the best performances by any athlete I have ever seen.

CFB,3dvq62,theymadtho,2,Mon Jul 20 11:31:43 2015 UTC,I'm not. That game reminds me of the fight my gf and I got into after the game. This was her first year at UT and my first year at A&M. She was upset that I wasn't happy that Texas won.
CFB,3dvq62,LineChatter,6,Mon Jul 20 14:22:21 2015 UTC,Can't wait!
CFB,3dvq62,OneManGOONsquad,6,Mon Jul 20 02:45:01 2015 UTC,As a Trojan I was bummed for years about that game.  But I knew it was an amazing game for the sport and I was glad my team was a part of it.  Plus it didn't hurt to have 2 titles the two years before that. :)
CFB,3dvq62,Panda412,6,Mon Jul 20 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Man.  I remember when Texas was on the USC 20 yard line or whatever, time was running out and they were down.  But everybody watching that game just knew Vince Young and Texas was going to win."

CFB,3dvq62,bushnov,5,Tue Jul 21 00:05:47 2015 UTC,I'll remember this game for the rest of my life. Vince Young was absolutely incredible in college. I thought for sure he would be a star in the pros.
CFB,3dvq62,StopMakingScents,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"Physically, he did fine in the NFL ( rookie of the year/pro bowl in his first year), but he apparently was clashing a lot with Jeff Fisher, which caused him a lot of mental distress, which affected his game a lot, which in turn caused him more distress. Once his confidence was gone through all of this, he never really recovered. Very unfortunate situation all around."
CFB,3dvq62,dickspace,3,Mon Jul 20 15:30:07 2015 UTC,Of all the busts that I can think of he is the one that I'm most upset about. One of my favorite college players going to one of my favorite NFL teams.
CFB,3dvq62,JewishAllah,2,Mon Jul 20 05:03:38 2015 UTC,I hope they talk about the USC @ Notre Dame game from earlier that season. That game was insane!
CFB,3dvq62,Cuspidx,3,Mon Jul 20 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, after that game my whole family was just convinced that we couldn't lose. It just didn't make sense that we won that game."
CFB,3dvq62,Hobodownthestreet,2,Mon Jul 20 07:37:36 2015 UTC,How can you not give your best player the ball with the game on the line? The pick at the end of the last Super Bowl brought me right back to St. Pete's decision to not even have Reggie Bush on the field with 4th and 2.
CFB,3dvq62,Hobodownthestreet,5,Mon Jul 20 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"Hell of a game, but the NFL already did one about it, and it was great. I dunno, if another one is needed, just my opinion."
CFB,3dvq62,unbn,30,Mon Jul 20 00:08:18 2015 UTC,I want to relive the glory over and over again like Uncle Rico forever and always!
CFB,3dvq62,sinurgy,5,Mon Jul 20 00:17:59 2015 UTC,Matt Leinart could throw a football over the mountains and Vince Young could had been a legend had Jeff Fisher put him in the second quarter he would be in hot tub with his soulmate right now.

CFB,3dvq62,guinness_blaine,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:06 2015 UTC,Why not the whole 1990's Nebraska Team. Fuck I want to see an 30 for 30 of them talking about the Nebraska Dynasty.
CFB,3dvq62,bubowskee,3,Mon Jul 20 08:10:57 2015 UTC,"They might do one and I think they should but they will probably look at a lot of different stories right now, they already did a documentary about a powerhouse steamrolling through everyone and then a sharp decline into mediocrity. You guys have done a better job stabilizing than Miami but the stories are very similar so it might be a while.  Honestly I would love to see a 30 for 30 about Harvard-Yale (fuck em) or Williams-Amherst, two great rivalries that go past the gridiron and into business even, the dynamics of those rivalries are so different than most"

CFB,3dvq62,Wacocaine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"they already did a documentary about a powerhouse steamrolling through everyone and then a sharp decline into mediocrity.   I get what you're saying but the Miami 30 for 30 was as much about ""the swagger"" as it was about them steamrolling through a couple of seasons. Also while 2001 Miami team was undoubtedly one of the best teams ever in college football, I don't think you can call that era a dynasty considering they only won 1 championship. That 92-97 stretch by Nebraska though was absolutely a dynasty, it's not even debatable. They had 3 undefeated seasons, won 3 national titles and if not for a wide right field goal in the closing seconds of the game they'd have won 4. They only lost 3 football games in a 5 year span (60-3). We may never witness that impressive of a stretch in college football again."
CFB,3dvq62,flarpington,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:30 2015 UTC,That team also had a lot of off the field stuff happen. Everything from Lawrence Phillips to Brook Berringer's plane crash after the season ended. It'd be a great documentary with a lot of emotional moments.

CFB,3dvq62,dmteadazer,23,Mon Jul 20 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"In fairness, if USC had sucked nobody would remember. It was a great game because it was a battle between two incredible teams that went down to the wire.  No sure if that helps..."

For those that don't remember, there was a massive failure in the equipment that prevented the refs in the booth from seeing the angle that clearly showed Vince Young's knee down before the lateral pass was made. I'm looking forward to the 30 for 30, but if they don't talk about this then it'll be a waste of a documentary   Quarterback Vince Young takes the snap, circles around the left end and runs 10 yards before a USC defender latches on. As the Texas quarterback tumbles, he pitches the ball to running back Selvin Young, who dashes 12 yards and into the end zone.   http://sports.yahoo.com/news/rush-judgment-200000105--ncaaf.html"
CFB,3dvq62,jvg265,3,Mon Jul 20 04:19:52 2015 UTC,Yea. In the second quarter. With 5 minutes left. Which would have still given them a first down.  Any slippery slope argument about time remaining at the end of the game is absurd.
CFB,3dvq62,sniffing_accountant,3,Mon Jul 20 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"There still isn't a guarantee that they would have made it into the end zone. It's not absurd to think that USC could have made a stop, forcing Texas to kick a field goal, which could have altered the game.  My original point was that it was the first time that instant replay was used to for college football games, and they made an error that was clear to the home viewers, but that replay officials couldn't review because the system wasn't properly set up upstairs. That's worth discussing in a 30 for 30."

Hurrying up and snapping the PAT to avoid a replay has been the go-to during the replay era in case of controversial calls. Malfunctions occur as well, Texas made sure they wouldn't get extra time to figure it out by rushing the PAT. In doing so, they missed the XP. You coach your players hurry up.  You're getting downvoted because only sore SC fans and Aggies would say if they don't include a missed call in the second quarter, it would be ""a waste of a documentary."""

Franklin was taking over a program from Bill O’Brien that was still crawling out of a hole created by NCAA sanctions. Depth issues are supposed to short-circuit this team. Well, three games in, and Penn State is 3-0—and dreaming big. Credit quarterback Christian Hackenberg, whose legacy continues to grow. He polished an already glossy resume by engineering his second fourth-quarter comeback victory in three games this season. This sophomore has the look of a franchise quarterback who appears destined to be a top-10 NFL pick at worst—and perhaps the No. 1 pick in the draft when he comes out. Under duress most the evening from a relentless Rutgers’ rush, Hackenberg ducked, scrambled and generally bought time en route to getting sacked five times and hurried numerous others. He also tossed a pick. Still, Hackenberg completed 25-of-44 passes for 309 yards. And none of his completions was bigger than a 53-yarder to Geno Lewis in the final Penn State drive that set up Bill Belton’s game-winning touchdown plunge from five yards. It came with 1:49 left and was the first time PSU led all night. - See more at: http://btn.com/2014/09/14/penn-state-rallies-crashes-rutgers-highly-anticipated-big-ten-debut/#sthash.Bkh7zzT4.dpuf   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NbYjJ18YJhc  Edit: post winning drive!

CFB,3dyu77,WeazelBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'm hesitant to say never for Kentucky or Vanderbilt, because really all it would take for those programs to turn it around is for someone like Martha Ingram, Thomas Frist, or Joe Craft to wake up one day and decide that they give a shit about football.

A&M retaliated by just straight buying those schools up, which then helped solidify their chokehold.  Fifty years after the first team shut down their program, A&M had bought all but one school, UT. Purely out of spite, they blockaded the school financially and watched it slowly deteriorate to barely a step above a community college.  UT ended up shutting their football program down after being unable to finance it at all.  The world as we know it is a bleak, desolate wasteland."

In 1906, Bama lost to Vandy 78-0. Article confirms that's the worst one.  Fun historical quirk I found while looking for this: in 1902, Alabama went 4-4. Every win was a shutout. Every loss was also a shutout.  EDIT 2: Fuck it, decided to do Rice as well. So far as I can tell, our 73-14 loss to UH in '09 is the worst.  On the bright side, found while looking for that that Rice is the proud owner of a 146-3 win over SMU in 1916!"

CFB,3dygyu,murgle1012,9,Mon Jul 20 16:01:20 2015 UTC,I feel like a committee picking four teams is the wrong way to do it. I'm sure I'm not the first person to feel this way though.  With a tournament as big as the NCAA tournament in basketball a committee can make mistakes on seeding/who gets in and not be hurt much for it in the end. The difference between that 68th and 69th team is minimal in the sense that neither of these teams are likely to go the distance anyway.  The difference between the 4th and 5th team could be minimal in a completely difference sense where either of these teams could go the distance. I feel like a ranking system like the BCS used in tandem with an 8 team playoff (preferable for me) would be the best situation.
CFB,3dygyu,Brady_Hokes_Headset,3,Mon Jul 20 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"My problem with an 8-team playoff is that it seems like too many teams. I mean, I don't think there were 8 teams last year that deserved a shot at the title. OSU, Oregon, Alabama, TCU, Baylor, FSU...that's really about it. In the prior years, the number of teams is usually around 5 or 6."
CFB,3dygyu,phillybadger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:13 2015 UTC,The issue with 6 is a bye in a 6 team playoff is a massive advantage and there is no good way to tell which team is more deserving of a bye out of 128 schools. Not to mention a 6 team playoff is going to play on exactly as many weekends as an 8 team playoff would. This just ensures that every team would start on the first weekend.
CFB,3dygyu,Brady_Hokes_Headset,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I sure as hell wouldn't want a 6 team playoff. I'm just not sure I like the idea of expanding it to 8, even if 4 isn't ideal either."
CFB,3dygyu,phillybadger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"I see your point. After those initial 5/6 teams, there is a bit of a drop off in talent. However, I think it would be worth so that those 5/6 ranked teams have a chance at the title. It seems more worthwhile to have 6 teams that each have a good chance at the championship then to miss out on them completely"
CFB,3dygyu,Colossus__,4,Mon Jul 20 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like the #9 team would have a lot less to complain about than #5..   #5 is probably a one loss team who you could say ""deserves a shot""  #9 is probably a team from a P5 Conference with 2 or more losses, I just think it's easier to say no to that."
CFB,3dygyu,jmac_21,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, getting up to eight teams a committee will get it correct more often than not.

CFB,3dygyu,liquorstorejerry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting that non-SEC folks were ok with continuing to use the BCS ranking system to select the top 4 teams.

CFB,3dygyu,anshr01,10,Mon Jul 20 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand the ""tiebreaker"" argument. In all the years previous conferences awarded co-champions or co-divisional champions. The tiebreaker for co-champions was only used for determining who went to what bowl. Both teams were still awarded conference championships one just got to go to the more special bowl game. While I think the lack of championship game probably hurt TCU and Baylor I don't think it was inherently the co-championship."
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,5,Mon Jul 20 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"100% agreed.  Of the things that hurt Baylor and TCU, the lack of a ""true"" champion (even though it's how everyone has always determined conference championships without a CCG) is pretty low on the list.  In order, I'd say:   Lack of a CCG, and hence the lack of another top rated win on either team's resume.   The Baylor-TCU situation.  It seemed that the committee believed TCU was stronger than Baylor for most of the season, but not wanting to put a team in that lost head to head (is everyone sick of this phrase?) to one of the first teams out, while at the same time not wanting to reward Baylor for their paltry OOC schedule and their loss to WVU.  With both out, they could avoid the issue entirely and safely settle the H2H argument.  Somewhat related to #1, Overall SOS, which by most computer rankings was lower than Ohio State, especially considering late season collapses from OU, Oklahoma State, and West Virginia to where none of those teams (which were ranked when TCU played them, not sure if they were ranked when Baylor did) were ranked at the end of the year.  Shared conference title, when conference titles were always noted to be important to the committee.   The fact that TCU and Baylor aren't a big national brand like OU or Texas."
CFB,3dygyu,Frog_Todd,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:33 2015 UTC,I think that last point combined with SOS were much larger factors than anyone wants to admit.
CFB,3dygyu,voltron818,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"This isn't even a conversation. Even if Baylor was to be crowned the B12 Champ, then who would they have replaced?  FSU rolled undefeated INCLUDING a CCG and had a tougher SOS throughout the entire year.  OSU finished with their third string QB on the back of their amazing RB and even shut out their B1GCG opponent and a Heisman finalist. Couple this with an amazing Heisman season for Mariota.  Alabama had a much tougher road to the playoffs and won the SECCG in impressive fashion.  Oregon had one loss to a team they ultimately pounded into submission in the PACCG, in Arizona.  Who the hell are you going to leave out and replace with Baylor? Just riddle me that."
CFB,3dygyu,Drunken_Wanderer,5,Mon Jul 20 16:08:26 2015 UTC,That isn't what I am trying to say at all. In fact I am saying the opposite. The Big 12 shouldn't be forced to name a champion. My issue is people criticizing the Big12 for not naming a champion when history shows conferences don't break ties for conference winners. All of the teams are named champions them they use tiebreakers for bowl bids since 4 teams from the Big Ten can't go to the Rose Bowl (1990 season). I don't think naming a champion would have helped but some people seem to think that this mythical naming of a champion is somehow better despite history showing conferences don't name champions. Plus this article makes it clear that some think that not dividing the title helps the Big 12.
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Right, naming a champ wouldn't have helped because the 4 teams who got in simply had a far better case than Baylor did.  They shouldn't be forced to name a champ. I agree. Just play and rest of the merits of the opponents you play and win against. If you're good enough, you get in. If you aren't, you don't.  Baylor wasn't good enough to get in."
CFB,3dygyu,Drunken_Wanderer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:20 2015 UTC,But people seem to think it would have. Particularly the powers that be in the Big 12 since they've instilled a new tiebreaker starting this year.   And I agree Baylor probably shouldn't have been in the event of a named champion. The Big 12 just wasn't as strong last year as it had been previously.
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think, for me, that it should have made a difference, that's all I'm saying. I look at the merits of all teams involved and select from those available teams, conference champ or not. At least one conference champ is always getting left out anyway, with the 4 team selection."
CFB,3dygyu,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:48 2015 UTC,It definitely makes it interesting. I mean personally I would prefer 8 but I am peachy keen at 4. I mainly want to see 8 because more football but I understand a lot of people's hesitance to do that.
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"If expansion were to happen, 8 is the only logical choice. None of this ""BYE"" BS. That being said, I still want the truly good/great teams to be required to play a near perfect season. Once you get into 8 teams, that kind of falls apart. I think we need to see a few more years at least before making a decision on what is truly right for the game."
CFB,3dygyu,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:30 2015 UTC,Definitely last year may just be an anomaly. Give it 5-10 years then we can decide ok expansion.
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"""Conference champion"" is an explicitly listed selection criteria.  Conference champion > conference co-champion > non-champion.  No way the playoff committee could give Baylor and TCU both the same credit for winning a conference championship when everyone else had only one champion.  That'd be extremely unfair to all other conferences.  But, the committee also wouldn't give just one full credit for a conference championship because the Big12 bylaws made them both co-champions.  None of this is to say that other criteria such as OOC schedule and having an extra game weren't also factors."
CFB,3dygyu,Stryker682,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"They are both conference champions. Per the rules that have existed in the sport far longer than last year they both won the conference. People get uppity because the Big 12's tag line was ""one true champion"" Baylor/TCU didn't get left out because they were sharing a title they got left out because 4 teams has arguably better résumés."
CFB,3dygyu,chuckthetruck64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think the lack of a single conference champion was the difference maker.  But, I do think it hurt their cases.  In fact, I don't see it could not have hurt.  Conference champion is expressly a selection criteria, so we know conference champions get at least a little extra credit vis-a-vis non-champions.  I seem to recall committee members having said that the Big 12 not having a single conference champion hurt.  Besides, it just makes logical sense that both Baylor and TCU would not receive as much credit for being conference champions as single conference champions because this would be give the Big 12 a huge advantage over all other conferences who can only have one champion."
CFB,3dygyu,Stryker682,3,Mon Jul 20 23:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we were champions last year but god damn I'm ready for this discussion to die. Party of me almost (almost) wishes we had lost to TCU. Then I could have enjoyed the second half of the season without feeling rage at endless discussion on FB, CFB, everywhere, and the Bears would have been ruthlessly motivated for four quarters instead of three in their bowl game against whomever. I never in a million years would have imagined that an 11-1 season and conference co-championship would leave me feeling sour and ready not to think about the season again."

I'd hate to see a larger flurry of off site shit ....  The real issue is the committee just lead up to the whole deal with a bunch of polls and standings when each was a one off.   No matter how much splainin folks took it as something it wasn't and that was kinda dumb (on all parts)."
CFB,3dygyu,CantaloupeCamper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Another thing  that doesn't get mentioned enough  is that the logical choice for big 12 champion (based off of head to head) and the best team in the big 12 according  to the media were not the same team.  The media seemed to be talking up TCU as the best team, but the big fault in putting them in the playoff was they had the head to head loss to Baylor.   Media has too much power in college football."
CFB,3dygyu,turbodollop,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"I've kind of flip-flopped around on this, but it seems fairly obvious that the 13th game was the deciding factor.  Baylor and OSU's regular season results were basically identical. Both teams played nine P5 opponents and three ""lesser"" teams.   The losses each had were extremely similar -- both played extremely poorly against good programs having less-than-stellar years.  OSU just got a bonus game against a probably overrated Wisconsin team, but it was an extra win against a Top 25 team and put them over the top.  In a different year, maybe that 13th game hurts the Big 10/SEC/ACC/Pac 12, maybe Baylor or TCU goes undefeated and the championship game is irrelevant."
CFB,3dygyu,chipoople,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"Who lumps FCS and G5 schools together in the same ""lesser teams"" bucket?"

CFB,3dygyu,PepperJck,4,Mon Jul 20 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Actually our loss was to a team that finished 7-5 and it was on the road, as opposed to a 6-6 team at home.  In the regular season, BU's top 3 wins (TCU, KSU, Oklahoma) were better than OSU's (MSU, Minnesota... PSU?).  The 13th game against Wisconsin was the clear difference."

CFB,3dygyu,PepperJck,4,Mon Jul 20 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Co-championships are part of college football. The last one to happen in each of the conferences are 2014 Big 12 (Baylor, TCU), 2010 Big Ten (Michigan State, Wisconsin), 1989 SEC (Alabama, Auburn, Tennessee), 2007 PAC (USC, Arizona State), and 1998 ACC (Florida St., Georgia Tech). All of these teams are recognized as conference champions despite sharing it. Also there are co-divisional champions in the applicable conferences which are recognized as division champions. Tiebreakers were only used to determine conference championship games and bowl tie-ins."

CFB,3dy23a,HokieinFL28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"agreed sadly ECU game for us is a lose lose... win and who cares, lose and its a season killer/drop in rankings.  Can't understand how we don't play FSU & Clemson enough -->FSU 2018 and then 2022  or Clemson 2017 and then 2024. But we play BC  which apparently is a rivalry game LOL (Big East). Our out of Conference games are getting much better so I guess that's a positive.   ODU doing camps..because they can and why wouldn't they?"
CFB,3dy23a,DBHT14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think Hokies think ECU is much worse than they are. Hell for two months they were the top G5. Polls respect a win over them much more than say EMU or Idaho not all G5's are equal. We also should be careful to hold ourselves to be too much better than them we were very close to landing in the same bucket.  And it is FSU, GT, and Clemson own fault we dont play more. They would rather keep 8 ACC games and their SEC game snd 3 OOC than lose another OOC to an ACC game. Not much Tech can do. I will take BC since we are on a two game losing streak I dont think we get to complain we get stuck with a bad crossover game."
CFB,3dy23a,HokieinFL28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:43 2015 UTC,Still ECU til 2020 is crazy.. I could see a buyout for the series in a couple years.  2 biggest games for ECU last year was VT and UNC.. This year its VT and UF.. they try to get 2 top 20-30 ranked teams for an OOC games so it could be worse like you said.
CFB,3dy23a,DBHT14,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:12 2015 UTC,And they play SCAR every few years. They were winning in the 4th quarter last year too

Cinci, UCF, and SCAR (they were supposed to be good last year, if you recall the preseason hype) are no slouches. We played all three last year in addition to VT and UNC. Cinci are going to be very good this season, that could end up being our biggest game this year, though I think it will be you guys."

I honestly get where VT fans are coming from when they complain about having to play us all the time. Unless we are ranked a loss to us doesn't look great because of the G5 label, and prior to that the non-AQ conference label. It sucks because these are typically really good football games (with fantastic fans and fan support on both sides) and it's a great litmus test every season for both teams in my opinion.   Part of our fanbase has the same reaction as yours when a team like App State wants a home-and-home. Though its not quite as bad now that they are FBS."

Who knows why but there's plenty to speculate as to why?  Age/Health, ACC title/playoff chances, uncertainty of new coach, and honestly the biggest piece I see is what happens when new HC comes in. Does he keep Bud or go with ""his guy"", what happens with offensive staff.  VT's situation will be very very interesting for the next 2 years.   If I'm the new HC I do everything I can to keep Bud and match him up with a legit offensive coordinator that can score points. yeah its easier said than done but at least a track record of good offenses/points per game."
CFB,3dy23a,DBHT14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:28 2015 UTC,I do like TKP and always a good laugh and definitely a younger skewed audience but there are a few spots Tech Sideline has them beat. Big ones are actual inside access to the program and taking the long view of everything. Hell TSL has a now 21 part series on the rise of the school from 1960 till the National championship game.  I dont think you would ever really see something like that on TKP.
CFB,3dy23a,HokieinFL28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly TKP is younger audience where the 21 part series would not get as much attention and would probably bore some people.   I think TSL has a different perspective- history, more beamer stuff, and good football alum stuff. While TKP is about NOW and does a great job with recruiting and game day stuff.

CFB,3dy23a,whethervayne,17,Mon Jul 20 13:56:58 2015 UTC,The commenters on 11W are downright creepy in their homerism. Video could leak of Urban kicking puppies and they'd fall over themselves praising him for controlling the stray pet population. Also they're ridiculously obsessed with the SEC for some reason.
CFB,3dy23a,TheInvisibleEnigma,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"they're ridiculously obsessed with the SEC for some reason.   Yup. Seems plenty of the articles find it necessary to make a jab at the SEC when the topic has little, if anything, to do with the SEC."

CFB,3dy23a,conservatore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:00 2015 UTC,"Basically the only articles I'll care to read the comments on are the strategy ones by Ross Fulton and Kyle Jones since it's usually just more football talk.  But other than that, 11W comments are pretty much a mess of stupid ""Meatchicken,"" ""scUM"", and ""Hairball"" jokes, complaining about the SEC, and whining every time a recruit commits somewhere other than Ohio State (""We didn't want him anyway!"" ""Come to OSU or lose to OSU!"")"

But it pretty much sucks. Our 247 site (bears truth) is well run and very informative and worth the money or a visit if you have a 247 membership for your team. Ourdailybears (Sbnation) is informative and if you're cheap it has much of the same info as bears truth a few day later minus the interviews and quotes.   Stay away from killerfrogs, and TexAgs has its own brand of unintentional humor, but every college football fan owes it to themselves to visit  Shaggybevo. Seriously.

The main ""newsy"" ones are infested with message board users who, for the life of me, I don't even consider fans. All they do is bitch (at best) or degrade all conversations into under-baked political diatribes (at worst) or delusional fantasies about Butch Davis returning to take the team to the promised land (ok, I lied before: this is actually the worst). There isn't a single thing on those boards (CanesInsight, etc.) that can't be learned on Twitter.  I bet that goes for a lot of fanbases, though."
CFB,3dy23a,SquirrelicideScience,3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:49 2015 UTC,IMO if you want to be bitter and constantly bitch about your team then you should root for a pro team. If you like getting your hopes up and then have your dreams (more often then not) crushed then CFB is for you.

CFB,3dxza6,djowen68,7,Mon Jul 20 14:53:01 2015 UTC,I feel like Ole Miss winning the West is a bolder call than Tennessee winning the East. Didn't they lose a lot of key players?
CFB,3dxza6,WeazelBear,5,Mon Jul 20 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"Ole Miss is returning 16 starters including 5 OL and 4 DL. They're getting Treadwell back, and although they don't have a returning QB, whoever wins the job will have a great OL so they'll be able to run, and he should have plenty of pass protection. If the QB can just not lose them games I think they've got a great shot.   They won't be undefeated, but catching Florida and Vandy from the East sets up well, plus they've got LSU at home. The fact that Mississippi State, Alabama and Auburn are all road games is really their biggest knock, but the Auburn game is a revenge game for them after Treadwell broke his leg and they lost last year. I could see them getting up for that and winning it. Plus they aren't afraid of Alabama anymore because they've shown they can beat them last year."
CFB,3dxza6,djowen68,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:26 2015 UTC,Good answer. I was completely off.
CFB,3dxza6,WeazelBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean they did lose some key guys. They lost Senquez Golson and Cody Prewitt in the secondary, so replacing them will be a challenge. Fortunately for them though, they get Alabama early enough that the new DB's won't have to worry about a fully fleshed out passing attack with an experienced QB and Amari Cooper-type.  And of course they lost Bo Wallace, but honestly I can see literally anyone they put at QB this year being an upgrade. They just need good decision making."
CFB,3dxza6,djowen68,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"I would call it a bold call, but really, all they're missing is a QB. If Swag Kelly is the answer, then they could make another deep run. Just have to not flame out like they did last year."

CFB,3dxza6,supposedtobeworkin,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:43 2015 UTC,"lol it pained me to do that. I can see it though.   Eighteen returning starters including;   QB and RB (+ Kamara)  4 offensive linemen   4 WR/TE's  An experienced DL and DB's.  Plus I think Dobbs is really going to be a difference maker. Florida and South Carolina are down. The Georgia game is at home. The schedule sets up well. Kentucky is a trap game after the Bama game but getting past that will set up well to end the year strong. UT might lose the Arkansas and Bama games, but if you beat Georgia that won't matter, because Georgia is likely to lose to both or at least one of their cross-division games."

CFB,3dxza6,supposedtobeworkin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, Florida being down doesn't matter. We traditionally play like shit around UF as of late. It'll be a close one, but we've always found a way to lose in the past."
CFB,3dxza6,climbsurfski,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"Surely not this year. Florida is returning only one starting offensive lineman. I've got to think that Tennessee's defense is just going to get in there and wreck them all day. A new coach + no offense is not good. Plus it looks like they're replacing their Kicker and Punter, so field position could be an issue for them. On top of all that, they play East Carolina and @Kentucky before UT. They're going to be gassed after that. They could even have two losses. I think that Kentucky game is going to take a lot out of them.

Second, Here are some stats for you:  Gary Pinkel coached quarterbacks (Franklin, Gabbert, and Daniel) all won their division in either their Junior or Senior seasons.  The offensive line in 2014 was almost all new starters keeping only the center from 2013. Next Year, the Offensive line will have 4 seniors and a sophomore.   The receiver core last year was old and resented Maty Mauk for his poor play (thank you Jimmie Hunt). This year the receivers are young and a little more experienced than last years squad, since they are so young they can be led by Maty Mauk.   Maty Mauk in the fourth quarter ranked No. 20 in the country in fourth-quarter pass efficiency. A 166.3 QBR, 5th in the nation. He threw 9 touchdowns, 2nd most in the nation. 9 passes of 25-plus yards, 7th most in FBS.  Maty Mauk in his first 3 major games:  Indiana (ugh) :  29/48 CMP/ATT 331 YRD 6.9 AVG 2 TD 1 INT  Georgia (ugh) :  9/21 CMP/ATT 97 YRD 4.6 AVG 0 TD 4 INT  Florida:   6/18 CMP/ATT 20 YRD 1.1 AVG 0 TD 1 INT  Maty Mauk his last 3 games:  Texas A&M:  23/40 CMP/ATT 252 YRD 6.3 AVG 1 TD 1 INT  Tennessee:  12/25 CMP/ATT 230 YRD 9.2 AVG 2 TD 0 INT  Arkansas:  13/30 CMP/ATT 133 YRD 4.4 AVG 2 TD 0 INT  If he gets those Maukisms coached out of him I think he can be a Heisman Frontrunner."

That's a huge component of what you were able to do offensively with the two WRs you lost, which were legit NFL style guys in size, etc. Without that threat, it slims down the offensive diversity. Snoddy is the returning backfield guy. If he is fully recovered/healthy, then he should be a monster. That being said, there's a good chance he's not 100% and also he can't do everything. With the lack of experience, I figure those skill position losses to be huge. Thomas ran his ass off, but he can't do everything. I'm not sure what ""seems to be going well"" is based off of. But since there hasn't been any live competition yet, there's no way to tell. I'm just saying it's a concern.

CFB,3dy581,AbortedFetusAMA,5,Mon Jul 20 15:11:33 2015 UTC,Dylan Thompson literally had the best season any South Carolina QB has ever had.

Same can be said for Maryland, Pitt, UCF (sorry, Knights, I love you guys still. Please schedule a forever home and home), USF, and plenty of other schools.  The reason those programs never ""blow up""  is because those talent-rich regions are highly competitive. One or two kids per year will want to stay home, but the rest will go elsewhere as has happened for decades."

I think Penn State and other premier programs will be fine, you guys can recruit from anywhere, but I think teams which were once great programs (thinking Pitt, Syracuse, etc) are just seeing the ultimate result of the demographic shift that has occurred over the past 40-50 years. It's hard to look at the geographic locations of major conferences and compare them to where the recruits are actually coming from without wondering how much longer some states can support successful programs."
CFB,3dycft,You_Dont_Party,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"This is definitely true, but Pittsburgh, the DMV, and NJ still produce a ton of talent. Not as much as Florida, of course, but enough that keeping more of it home could make whichever program a legit contender.  But, as we've determined, that probably won't happen with less kids to choose from."

CFB,3dycft,OhGad,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:46 2015 UTC,"This is all I will say.  With no money and a bad conference to be in, Rutgers has become an above average program with only fairly minimal investment into it.    Now just imagine when the program has the funds to invest at a high level.      As for the talent in the surrounding area, even if PSU stays the recruiting power of the east, being the clear #2 would still make Rutgers a high level program.  IMO."

CFB,3dycft,SurpriseSalami,0,Mon Jul 20 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"Of course they could benefit as much as TCU has but the question is if they will.  I don't really see Rutgers ever being better than what Purdue or Indiana are in the Big 10.  They don't have a history of success and that was with having to play against Cincy, UConn, USF, Pitt, Syracuse etc.  They couldn't really compete at the BE level and now people expect them to compete at the Big 10 level?  TCU at least had a strong football resume heading into the conference and they have capitalized on it."
CFB,3dycft,GhostdadUC,4,Mon Jul 20 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"I think on one hand, they will benefit from the increased money and exposure playing big name schools.

CFB,3dycft,Sh-tstirrer,4,Mon Jul 20 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"*AAC. That said, yes, the B1G east was one hell of a conference to jump into from a much weaker conference. I have hope for Rutgers due to the wealth of talent available in NJ/PA, as well as the fact that its so close to NYC. With better facilities, I really think Rutgers can make a large jump and at least contend with the bigger schools in its conf."
CFB,3dycft,VaughnTrue,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:06 2015 UTC,AAC but the point stands.  They will definitely get better players now but instead of having to compete against teams who occasionally get a 4 star recruit every so often they will be competing against teams who get quite a few 5 stars every year.  I don't think their jump in recruiting is going to be enough to compensate for their jump in competition.
CFB,3dxvyq,SurpriseSalami,33,Mon Jul 20 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Meyer and Fisher seem to be the most likely candidates for another title to add to their accomplishments. Saban too, but this season will be telling as to whether we can expect the same old Bama. I still think Saban is the best coach out, but this sport is so goddamn hard to win national titles consistently - and Saban has to compete in a division that has become competitive top to bottom. That Urban and Saban have 7 between them is unprecedented. Saban can still be the best coach in the sport and not win another title just on account of all the other factors swirling around him at Alabama.  Saban and Meyer won't be changing jobs but retiring. Fisher could still change jobs down the road.  Les Miles has the potential to win another. However, the pressure is mounting in Baton Rouge for reasons I still cannot fathom - the amount of attrition LSU's suffered in the past couple of years to talent leaving is astounding, all things said and done, and he still develops talent and keeps LSU in the hunt for the division (which again, top to bottom, really good so far). I suppose this next year will see if that seat gets hot for some parties.  Bob Stoops is an interesting one. I like what Oklahoma has done. I like where they're projecting. But the hump that Stoops has to get over seems more insurmountable than what Saban or Miles has to deal with for another title - and I don't know what's going on there because it really shouldn't be. Every time I think Oklahoma's got a shot there's something that goes wrong. At some point I'd like to think Stoops could win one, but Baylor and TCU are going to be good for a while, Holgorsen is going to confound any contender that has to play in Morgantown, and Texas won't be down forever. Put me under the gun though, and I'll say he's got a better shot than Miles (excluding, of course, any Big 12 shenanigans that puts their schedule as a disadvantage or conference instability). Too many shortchange Oklahoma's potential.  Larry Coker won't. He's 67 and at UTSA. His only shot would be if Miami fires Golden and he's invited to come back, but it'd be a rebuild period before they could contend for a title - by that time I think he'd be too old and looking to hang them up. Even if he were to try to rebuild them, the recruiting dynamic in south Florida has shifted since those 2000s Miami teams. Whoever runs the Canes needs to make a much harder pitch these days."

I don't think he's going to going to get another one on the way out. What he's done at South Carolina is impressive on the sheer basis of building up a powerful program where there wasn't, but it's not enough to get to the top of the mountain.   To start, the SEC East hasn't won the Championship since 2008. USC hasn't seen a BCS Bowl/NY6 in Spurrier's whole tenure. And each year, those 3 11-win seasons are getting further in the rear view, recruiting numbers don't really indicate a breakout is coming, and Spurrier's tone indicates he's thinking what we all are about the HBC's future. I think his best shot was 5 years ago, in Atlanta, and he'll be facing a hard lie to play from here.  His legacy's pretty secure though and there's greens to be smashed."

Even if he were to try to rebuild them, the recruiting dynamic in south Florida has shifted since those 2000s Miami teams.

But the players chose him for the gig when Davis left, so it's not like he couldn't get guys to play for him. When talent doesn't pan out, some blame goes to the coach, but not all.  The results speak for themselves but I also wonder how much is there, and how much is on the recruiting dynamic of south Florida shifting so turbulently. The downfall of Miami with Coker isn't something I think we've fully figured out, and when we can't figure things out in sports we have a tendency to blame/praise the coach."
CFB,3dxvyq,DeKaF,11,Mon Jul 20 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"Only Coker, whose basically guaranteed to win every Natty for the next ten years."

CFB,3dxvyq,loserkid182,9,Mon Jul 20 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"First off, I just don't see any of these coaches winning a national title at a different school than the one they're at right now. With that in mind, I'm putting those coaches in order from most to least likely to win another title:   Meyer. One of the top two coaches in the country, and younger than Saban. Most importantly, his team is best positioned for a title in 2015. Fisher. Mostly because of age (he's got a lot longer in front of him than Saban, in theory), and partly because of the slightly less strenuous competition in conference. Saban. As long as he's at Alabama, they will be perennial contenders. But the competition within their division is heating up significantly. Miles. Really tough to decide between Miles and Stoops. Ultimately, I think Miles has his program a little steadier. Stoops. They've been a little rocky of late, with coaching turnover and up and down seasons. It wouldn't surprise me if he won another, but at this point I'll say it's more likely that he doesn't. Spurrier. He's old, there's a lot of competition, and his team is not currently primed to contend for a national title. Larry Coker. Oh yeah, Larry Coker exists. Cool!   Edited to add Spurrier, who was left out by OP at first"
CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,8,Mon Jul 20 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"Meyer, Fisher - yes. Saban probably, though he's getting old.   The rest, including gene chizik if he ever gets another job, no."
CFB,3dxvyq,Brutuss,3,Mon Jul 20 13:05:30 2015 UTC,"including gene chizik if he ever gets another job   That's a good question. Also, does he go down as being a better coach than Will Muschamp??"
CFB,3dxvyq,DetectiveWood,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"Also, does he go down as being a better coach than Will Muschamp??   Yes."
CFB,3dxvyq,mags87,7,Mon Jul 20 17:37:24 2015 UTC,Coker has a shot if you can find him another team with 15+ future 1st rounders.  Really how good of a coach was he over there? The U Pt. 2 implied that he was little more than a glorified chaperone since the players basically ran the team.
CFB,3dxvyq,mhall1104,14,Mon Jul 20 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"Nick Saban. Yes, but not at another school. I think he finishes at Alabama. Urban Meyer. Yes at Ohio State. I can't really see him going to another school, but I thought that at Florida too, so who knows.. Jimbo Fisher. I'm going to say no at FSU, but yes somewhere else.  Les Miles. I want to say no, but I've learned better to short sell a guy with voodoo on his side. Bob Stoops. No. Larry Coker. No."
CFB,3dxvyq,No_Way_Pablo,11,Mon Jul 20 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"Urban Meyer. Yes at Ohio State. I can't really see him going to another school, but I thought that at Florida too, so who knows..   I think there are very few programs ahead of Florida. OSU is one of them but Florida, as an overall program, is one of the best schools. It's like they always win a natty is some sport every year."
CFB,3dxvyq,DetectiveWood,13,Mon Jul 20 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"OSU is definitely ahead of Florida for someone from Ohio and with a degree from Ohio State. I think there are also probably certain coaches who would put Florida ahead of Ohio State, too.  But it's worth noting that Meyer didn't choose between Ohio State and Florida. He left Florida for personal reasons (insert theory about those reasons here), didn't coach for a year, then got hired at Ohio State."
CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"I think his point was about football. I don't think there's really a debate about it; Ohio State is ahead of Florida in just about every measurable aspect.  His comment about other sports is where you could make an argument. Ohio State's athletic department is both massive and successful, but Florida's AD is a wizard. Florida's consistency with non-revenue sports isn't something that a lot of schools outside of the PAC-12 do.   But it's worth noting that Meyer didn't choose between Ohio State and Florida.   Agreed. Had the OSU spot opened up while he was still at Florida (and successful) I'm not so sure he'd leave. Everyone always points to the ""three school buyout"" clause or whatever it was in his contract, but you don't leave the top of the mountain for a chance to reclimb one that's only a few feet taller."
CFB,3dxvyq,Ohwhat_anight,6,Mon Jul 20 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"I think his point was about football. I don't think there's really a debate about it; Ohio State is ahead of Florida in just about every measurable aspect.   Right now, absolutely true. Ohio State has better players, better coaches, more success, and is generally better positioned than UF right now. But UF still has advantages over Ohio State in certain measurable aspects, including revenue. And if you actually compare the two programs when they're humming at maximum power, I think there are quite a few ways that UF would outrank Ohio State.  If anything, I think a fair judgement of the two programs is that they are essentially equal, and that either one could outpace the other given the right people at the helm (as Urban has demonstrated for both programs).   His comment about other sports is where you could make an argument. Ohio State's athletic department is both massive and successful, but Florida's AD is a wizard. Florida's consistency with non-revenue sports isn't something that a lot of schools outside of the PAC-12 do.   Absolutely, I think team-for-team, Florida has the best athletic program in the nation. It's annually ranked in the top 5 of the Director's Cup (had been on a streak of second place finishes until this year's drop to 4th) despite fielding far fewer teams than the other programs in that stratosphere.     But it's worth noting that Meyer didn't choose between Ohio State and Florida.   Agreed. Had the OSU spot opened up while he was still at Florida (and successful) I'm not so sure he'd leave. Everyone always points to the ""three school buyout"" clause or whatever it was in his contract, but you don't leave the top of the mountain for a chance to reclimb one that's only a few feet taller.   Yup. I believed then and will always believe that Urban had intentions to eventually get back into coaching after he left UF. I think he also intended to take a longer sabbatical than just one season. But the unexpected opening at his dream job in his home state was just not something he could pass up--nor should anyone have expected him to."
CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"When you're comparing revenue are you speaking football or athletic department in general? Because while I would believe UF's department revenue is larger, I'd be quite surprised if they had a larger revenue from only football. Ohio State, as far as I know, has the benefit of a much larger stadium (ticket sales), alumni base, fan base, and merchandise sales."
CFB,3dxvyq,Ohwhat_anight,3,Mon Jul 20 18:27:28 2015 UTC,I was looking at 2014 college football revenue as reported by the Wall Street Journal.
CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. TIL!   I wonder how much expenditures affect that though. Like, if  Ohio State makes the same as Florida but spends more it will post lower revenue. If a school is spending more on its football program (like Texas, who I assume is raking in stacks of money but also spends it in stacks) I feel perhaps that may be a better indicator of ""prestige""? Just my two cents."
CFB,3dxvyq,Ohwhat_anight,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"Well revenue is strictly income before expenses, by definition. So those numbers don't even take into account how schools are spending that revenue."
CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,7,Mon Jul 20 19:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you on Jimbo - if he leaves it would be for the NFL I imagine, so he certainly could do a Saban, but it's far more likely he just stays at FSU permanently."
CFB,3dxvyq,mickeyquicknumbers,6,Mon Jul 20 13:18:25 2015 UTC,"Yes for Meyer, Saban, and Fisher. No for Coker and Miles. Stoops is the hardest to predict to me but I'll say probably yes"
CFB,3dxvyq,Dustin65,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about why you say no for Miles?  He's continued to bring in top talent.  The SEC West is the toughest division in CFB outside of the ACC Coastal (/s), but it seems 1A/B are Bama/LSU and then 2A-E are the rest.  So I'd have to think Miles has at least a decent shot at another title if he can ever get a decent QB."
CFB,3dxvyq,Napalmradio,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:26 2015 UTC,It's because the division is so tough that I wouldn't bet on him. Right now it seems like Auburn would be 1B over LSU. Also I know he's getting older and I don't know how much longer he plans on coaching
CFB,3dxvyq,Dustin65,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I want to wait to see how this season goes for Malzahn to definitively call Auburn 1B.  Though if they're looking strong in November I'm totally content to eat crow."
CFB,3dxvyq,Napalmradio,4,Mon Jul 20 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"You forgot Spurrier, not that I think he will win one for South Carolina, I certainly hope so but he had one at Florida."

CFB,3dxvyq,ExternalTangents,0,Mon Jul 20 13:28:11 2015 UTC,"Definately, we just had one bad year, if we show improvement and not having so many 4th quarter collapses, Spurrier will be fine to be back at coaching at the next 4-5 years rate he had been saying before. It's not likely but it's not outside the realm of possibility"
CFB,3dxvyq,Hubrishippo,9,Mon Jul 20 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"Saban: Honestly, with the other programs around them building up, I won't say it's ""doubtful"" but I will say it's ""questionable"". That being said, another 1-2 before retirement should be almost expected.  Meyer: Yes. OSU consistently wins 10+ games/year. They'll make it and probably win at LEAST once more under Urban. They're one of ~5 teams this year alone that is built perfectly for a playoff/championship run this coming year, and they typically ""reload"" just as well as LSU, etc. Also they pulled in Tony Alford, one of the best recruiters in the country to help them continue their success.  Fisher: Really hard to say. But I'd say 1 at least. Jameis is one of those ""once in a lifetime"" QBs who led them to their NC and that defense in 2013 was amazing. Golson, if he's healthy, starts, and plays to the best of his ability, has a solid shot to make them a playoff team better than any of their returning QBs. In the future, FSU will have plenty of resources to build another couple of runs, though. The talent they're bringing in right now and their youngest guys are top notch to build on. But, another factor is that Fisher could also leave soon for the NFL.  Miles: Yes. He has one ""down"" year and then builds back up. LSU should be in solid contention for the West this next year, which should net them a playoff spot if they win the SEC. I actually think they beat Bama this year. That being said, I'm still fully aboard my Arkansas hype train for this coming season.  Stoops: Younger, so he has more time. Typically, OU are destined to be around 10 wins but they made a VERY solid hire pulling in Kerry Cooks from ND. He's another of the best recruiters in the country and should net them a solid stock of talent to build on during his time there. I see Stoops getting 1-2 more at OU before he's out, unless he really drops like Wile E. Coyote off a cliff.  Coker: No."
CFB,3dxvyq,Drunken_Wanderer,3,Mon Jul 20 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"I like your assessment for a number of reasons, but the best part is the Stoops to Coyote comparison because I feel like he's already over the edge of the cliff. He just hasn't looked down yet."

I think he has had some trouble recently but people don't realize how big of a deal bringing in Kerry Cooks will be for OU. I mean it when I say ND lost two top ~5-10 recruiters in the nation with Cooks and Alford."
CFB,3dxvyq,Drunken_Wanderer,3,Mon Jul 20 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"I mean that I think power is shifting away from OU in that conference. Baylor and TCU are stepping up. Texas won't stay dead forever. Billy Snyder has probably used his arcane wizard magic to bind his soul to a phylactery and transform himself into an undead and immortal lich, so he'll be coaching at K-Stats forever. I don't think they'll regress much while he's there.   I don't know what Stoops can do, if anything, to bring his team back to the top of the big 12, let alone the nation."
CFB,3dxvyq,TurboSloth9000,3,Mon Jul 20 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"Baylor   Right, but Texas is part of the reason why Baylor is even where they are right now. Their success under Briles directly correlates to Texas' slump. Check the timeline.   TCU   TCU on the other hand has been successful under Patterson this whole time in multiple conferences, spanning a decade and a half. I think they're capable of standing financially better than Baylor, and with a coach who has over a decade of proven success in multiple conferences. It's not even close, Patterson wins over Briles by a long shot in the coaching department.   KSU/Snyder   Not sure what the point is bringing Snyder/KSU into the equation. He's a great coach and a popular figure to praise on /r/CFB, but he's not exactly the B12's most influential coach and KSU isn't powerful enough to have that much of an effect on how other programs develop. Stoops/OU is far and away more influential than Snyder/KSU. If KSU ""regress"" any compared to where they are now, they'll be running just barely above .500 on a somewhat regular basis. They only had two truly threatening years in the last 5-6, which were 2011 and 2012.   Stoops/OU   If you familiarize yourself with Stoops' record, he has blocks of 3-4 years of massive success, then goes for a rebuild of an 8-win or so season, and then builds back up again. He's very similar to Les Miles in this regard, having a cycle like this."
CFB,3dxvyq,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"I mean that as they stand now, I would call all of those teams threats to Oklahoma, at present or soon to be.

CFB,3dxvyq,Drunken_Wanderer,-5,Mon Jul 20 14:24:47 2015 UTC,I just find it funny that you say Meyer will win because of X and X but Saban is doubtful because of X and X and they are identical programs in similar conferences.
CFB,3dxvyq,WrongWayBo,4,Mon Jul 20 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think people are way too bearish on Saban. The man is batting .500 over the past 6 years in championships.  Could he lose? Obviously. But honestly the only reason why I wouldn't pick Saban is because homer-me expects him to retire after Meyer wins the next five straight."
CFB,3dxvyq,tosuthrowaway1,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:32 2015 UTC,It literally blows my mind. Him and Meyer are equals and the only reason I give Saban the nod is he went into a bad LSU and a bad Alabama and turned the programs around almost over night. Literally TWO games since 2008 has he not been in contention.
CFB,3dxvyq,WrongWayBo,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"Identical programs   Wat.   Similar conferences   No.  Conclusion: Sometimes (most of the time, really) you say the darnedest things."
CFB,3dxvyq,Drunken_Wanderer,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:33:48 2015 UTC,Aight So Meyer will win another title because he wins 10+ per season in a developing conference. Saban wins 10+ per season and brings in BETTER talent year in and year out than anyone in the country. We play in a deteriorating conference which imo will make it easier to win. Saban has similar odds to winning another title just like Meyer. Les won't even smell more than 10 wins in a season ever again in his tenure. Like I don't understand you logic in your evaluations of the programs.
CFB,3dxvyq,WrongWayBo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I saw the word logic, but I've concluded that logical conversations are very rare when you are involved, so I have no desire to continue discussing this."

We can win 10+ but dropping 1-2 games give us a lower chance at winning a natty.   Now as for OSU, they currently only have to worry about Penn State, MSU, and.... drawing a blank, but propably none else. Meyer has a higher rate due to a weaker conference.   Am I wrong on that so far /u/drunken_wanderer ?"
CFB,3dxvyq,DetectiveWood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"He said that with the other programs building up, it would be questionable. We can win 10+ but dropping 1-2 games give us a lower chance at winning a natty.    Yes, but dropping anything over 1 game won't get you in, SEC champ or not. You're not getting in with 2 losses, ever, barring any crazy 2007-type garbage. Even then, with a situation similar to that, I think that's when a G5 gets the nod, provided they played a couple tougher OOC games.   Meyer has a higher rate due to a weaker conference.    ""Weaker"" is not what I'd call it. It's different, which is why I kind of scoffed at him saying they're ""basically the same"" in another comment. When we're looking at teams building up, the B1G has some of the same going on. MSU has simply ""arrived"" and they are basically done building. Michigan just by sheer coaching change should be a better team, though perhaps not that huge of a threat, however it's a rivalry game. Jerry Kill is...killing it...at Minnesota, it seems right now, so figure them to be a threat to any team they see (I have them as a decent chance to knock off TCU early this year). Penn State as you said could be a risky game, though it's in the Shoe so that should help OSU. IU finally has a QB again in Sudfield (seems odd to consider IU, but they should be at least decent, although losing the best RB in IU history kind of sucks), and VT has as good an overall defense as the majority of SEC teams.  That being said, OSU do have somewhat of a weaker bottom end, however VT makes up for that a bit. Also, Hawaii shouldn't be taken lightly, especially with Wittek going out there now, and potentially having an instant impact on their offense. Frankly, Illinois is another team I'd be wary of. They've improved every single year under Beckman. It's all up in the air right now for that team.  But, yes, the STAGE at which some of the teams in the West are in is further along than the B1G teams OSU may see this coming year. I'd say we can realistically say that there are more threats on Bama's schedule than on OSU's schedule, but to say ""weaker"" without actually seeing this year's iteration of these teams play at all would be unfair."

Spurrier will retire, Malzahn will go to the NFL, Les will retire, Richt will continue to Richt, Freeze will move on to greener pastures; The SEC is going to lose strength relatively soon while the B1G is going to get harder and harder every passing year. Saban is just as likely to win titles at the very end of his career with Meyer winning titles in the next 2 years before the B1G becomes littered with elite coaches.   Edit: Basically his argument is that the SEC is tough and the B1G is soft. Which history proves will become an inverse making it easier for Saban to continue to win titles. Saban has been out of title contention in TWO games since 2008, not including bowl games. During the PEAK of the SEC.

CFB,3dxvyq,Yurwrstntmre,4,Mon Jul 20 13:14:23 2015 UTC,Who can OU get thats a better coach than Stoops though?

Urban Meyer - Once again, yeah, I think he's got another national title or two in him at Ohio State.  Jimbo Fisher - Hmmm, this one is somewhat uncertain. I think the potential for him to win another title is there, but I can't see him doing it again before he gets an NFL gig or something -- which I think will happen at some point.  Les Miles - Reflexively, no. I don't think he'll leave LSU anytime soon, but man, it's really hard for me to see him winning another national title when he's in a pretty tough division. I don't think it's impossible, but I can't see it happening, even with all the talent he can accumulate.  Bob Stoops - Once again, I don't think it's impossible, but if you made me choose one or the other, I doubt very much he'll win another national title. Also, yes, I think he's pretty much set at OU until he retires.  Larry Coker - No. Just no. The title he won in 2001 with Miami could have been won with probably half the coaches in FBS; the team he had was just that stacked across the board. Anyways, he's at UTSA now, so unless he pulls a Howard Schnellenberger, that's not happening.  Steve Spurrier - You forgot him. I think once he's done at South Carolina, he's done coaching. No, I don't think he'll win a national title again."

Like most places, our population is roughly 50/50 blue and red (with a bit more blue) so if every person who voted against Obama booed and all the Dems stayed quiet, it would sound like the whole stadium disliked him. There was a literal silent majority of support.  And I don't think the booers hate Obama.

CFB,3dvhml,AnatomyHero,63,Sun Jul 19 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"That whole booing controversy was blown wayyyyy out of proportion. I was at that game, and what actually happened was that they played this ""It's On Us"" commercial during a stoppage early in the game. This is the first time that they aired this commercial in the stadium, and for me, this was the first time I had ever seen this commercial in general.   So despite being recently renovated, the speakers at Spartan Stadium aren't very good, and it is especially difficult to hear everything in the student section. When they played this commercial, it was hard to understand a single word of what was being said by the actors in this commercial. If you weren't intently listening, you would have never guessed that this commercial is about rape. And of course, we're in a football stadium, so most people don't really listen to commercials anyway.  At the end of the commercial, Obama's face flashed on the screen and people immediately started to boo. As someone in the stadium at the time (although I didn't boo), the booing had absolutely nothing  to do with the ""It's On Us"" campaign, and everything to do with people being against the president. Seriously, show a picture of Obama's face for a few seconds, and see what happens in most big stadiums.   It's pretty unfair that we get labeled as anti-rape haters when in reality, that's not even close to what happened at all.   Edit: Clarification"

CFB,3dvhml,kelly495,25,Mon Jul 20 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"Hoo boy.   (For those unaware the away band sits in a legitimate seating section in the end zone, with just an aisle separating you from season ticket holders)  The clarinet section had a few punches thrown at them. We had to throw away several uniforms because people would walk down the aisles and ""accidentally"" spill their food over us. A female band assistant, when going to the bathroom, was spat on by a middle aged man. We had random items thrown at us from fans in rows above us. We had fans getting in our faces and screaming at us for no particular reason that our parents must have hated us (kinda hilarious though) or were slutty or that I was adopted or etc etc. There was one mother, who while holding her young child, kept screaming ""fuck you blue"" to the tune of Let's Go Blue when we played it. People would come up to us and take selfies with us while flipping the bird/aiming a punch at our face and laughing when we flinched. I get that opposing stadiums are hostile to bands, but we went to MSU, ND, and OSU last year, and the Horseshoe was beyond anything else.   The best though is after the game, when the fans inevitably rush the field. Despite the fact that Ohio Stadium has the two huge tunnels where the teams come out of, everyone who rushes the field has to exit through the tiny entrance in the opposite end zone where the OSUMB does their ramp entrance, which is right where our band sits. We get trapped there usually for about 60-90 minutes while the field filters out. 2014 wasn't too bad, just lots of middle fingers, cussing, and renditions of ""We Don't Give A Damn"", but in 2012, when the Ohio police ""forgot"" to give us a police escort, I heard it got nasty.   My personal favorite was when a group of trumpets went to use the bathroom in the concourse before the game, and as soon as we walked in, a big guy looked at us and went ""man, does it suddenly smell like shit in here or what?""   EDIT: i accidentally a letter"

Isaiah McKenzie being a solid returner helps set them up for solid drives, which I think will be a big deal this year.

Look at the QB's of the teams that beat the SEC champions.  Jameis Winston and Cardale Jones.  I don't believe that there is one QB on the UGA roster that is capable of reaching that level of play.    I've only had legitimate hype for a SEC & national title in 07 and 12/13.  Both of those years we had QB's capable of winning it all.  We just didn't put it all together."

CFB,3dy280,Johnnycockseed,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"Auburn has more than one skill player returning. Duke Williams (the one youre most likely talking about), Marcus Davis, Ricardo Louis, and Melvin Ray. The recieving corps only lost Sammie Coates and Quan Bray. Running Backs lost CAP and Corey Grant. QB lost Nick Marshall (gonna be interesting to see how our run game holds up with this loss)."
CFB,3dy280,bigwhiskey91,4,Mon Jul 20 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"ULM   @VAN   SCAR   Southern   ALA   @TEN   MIZ  --most likely 6-1 by the Bye Week--  FLA in JAX  KEN   @AUB  GSU   @GT  I see 7 wins for sure, with 5 games (in bold) that could go either way.  I'll give UGA the benefit of a doubt on all of those games, with the exception of Bama.  Given the fact that UGA always drops a game that they shouldn't, I'll say that they lose 2.  10-2 regular season, probably 6-2 in the conference.  I think they only drop one game before the bye week, and are well in the hunt going into the second half of the season.  Or, they'll drop 2 early on and get their shit together following a bye week and a dismantling of Florida.  In the East, I can't see Tennessee, South Carolina, or Florida winning 7 or more conference games.  Missouri would be their only challenge and UGA has them at home this year.  Of the teams listed, I think that UGA should beat all of them straight up anyway, so they'll own the tie breaker.  If/when UGA gets back to Atlanta, they'll likely face an Auburn or Alabama team that they'll know better the second time around.  We give Richt a lot of shit on this sub, but he's still a damn good coach.  If you let him have a second look at any team on that schedule, he'll put up a damn good fight the second time around."

I think that if UGA loses 2 games before the bye week, Richt and his staff will bring the team together and put a plan in place to build and sustain momentum to carry them for the rest of the season.  I don't think that they're going to dismantle Florida just because it's Florida and you're in a transition period, I think that Richt will utilize that big rivalry to regroup the team should things start out rough."

Our QB situation is something that may hold us back but I think it'll be equivalent to last year if not a little better.   On the flip side, the defense is returning a solid LB core alongside a more experienced defense which should bode well with Pruitt's style.   As expected pulling Bama and (always) Auburn sucks as I'd predict us to win the East hands down with a more favorable schedule (e.g. Mizzou).   I think if you have to pick a team out of the east, UGA is a pretty solid bet. However, I don't think it's as as safe as some think because of how unpredictable the east has been in the past few years alongside UF and UT's eventual returns to legitimacy. I honestly think we could go undefeated but also could easily drop 4 games in conference play.   But Eason right? There's always next year..."

CFB,3dy280,SqoishMaloish,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:40 2015 UTC,It seems like everyone is replacing their QB this season so a new QB shouldn't necessarily be a negative for UGA. On paper they are the best team in the east and should make the SECCG. But seasons rarely work out the way that they should on paper. The schedule is tough with both AU and UA from the west. You can't count out Florida or South Carolina from pulling off the upset and even though Georgia should win both those games that doesn't mean they will. I could honestly see Georgia missing the SECCG and to be honest I see Missouri winning the east simply because Missouri is more consistent and doesn't drop games they shouldn't  (in conference.)
CFB,3dy280,TheCobbledTiger,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think UGA will cruise to the SEC championship 6-2 in conference play, losing two to Alabama, Auburn, UF, TENN, or Mizz. They then have a rematch with the SECW team they lost to (let's say Auburn because Auburn plays they main SECW contenders at home plus UGA at home, but AU AND UA are interchangeable) I think UGA wins the rematch in a close game dishing out the first loss to AU. Despite winning the SEC, they still are left out of the playoffs while the SEC runner up (be it the loser of the champ game or the loser of the iron bowl, depending on the loser of the IBs other games) goes to the playoffs, and UGA is ranked 3rd out of the SEC teams. UGA is a good team, and I think they'll have the advantage in a rematch as they have such a good coach."

Auburn got Barrett cause Pass waited. Auburn backed off. Bama got Hurts, Pass waited. Pass isn't going to compete against another 4 star and Barnett and Cornwell. He was out. Saban kept going after him cause he does that shit. We didn't NEED him but he's a great talent.   You're the one being arrogant in this, not me. I have not stated anything biased or ignorant. Pass has a better chance, and will have a better career at Louisville. He will sit at Bama, cause we obviously have a shitty time picking QBs, and will sit at Auburn, Johnson and White have the next 4 years locked.

For awhile we were the sure bet, but once we got Jalen Hurts, we (the fans) knew that Pass was gonna go some where else. It was spread that he wanted to be the only QB in his class. Well Auburn and Bama weren't gonna wait on him. Bama needs RBs BAD. We still need 2 more and a possibly 3rd if Emmons doesn't qualify.

CFB,3dyu2z,Montagge,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"While I get what you're saying, I am not okay with that. Oregon will win a championship and soon."
CFB,3dyu2z,puzzledvaliant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"Advanced football metrics would suggest otherwise. Oregon has accumulated an SRS above 20 in 4 of their last 5 years. Only other teams to put up those numbers are/were winning titles. We'll get there. Helfrich is still growing as a coach. Oregon has more seasons with an SRS above 20 in the past 5 years than Texas, Auburn, LSU, Michigan, Tennessee, or Georgia have had in the past 35 seasons."

CFB,3dyu2z,fooke33,4,Mon Jul 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,He will retire from UGA unless he goes on a 6 wins or less streak. I firmly believe he will win the SEC very soon and the CFP championship shortly thereafter. Soon as in less than 4 years.

CFB,3dyu2z,rodandanga,4,Mon Jul 20 17:25:59 2015 UTC,I think it all depends on how long we're able to keep Pruitt on board.
CFB,3dyu2z,Mario_Speedwagon,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:02 2015 UTC,And how well the new OC meshes with the college game.
CFB,3dyu2z,rodandanga,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"I think Pruitt is gone after two more years, personally.  By that time he'll have shown he's ready for a head coach gig and there will be good quality schools pursuing him.  After this year you'd have to think some of the smaller FBS schools would pursue him (assuming y'all's defense remains good)."
CFB,3dyu2z,mjacksongt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I agree. I don't think he'll be here for long. Hopefully we snag a championship while he's here though. He did at Alabama and Florida State so maybe he can do it for us!"
CFB,3dyu2z,Mario_Speedwagon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think they've missed their window.  They've had a run of great years, but haven't won it, despite a few down years in their division.  With Tennessee and Florida having new coaches, their days of being the clear #1 in the division are likely over."
CFB,3dyu2z,link3945,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:19 2015 UTC,I think Johnson will win one for GT before it is all said and done.

CFB,3dyu2z,i_fap_to_anything,4,Mon Jul 20 18:11:18 2015 UTC,He is the Last Great American Hero.
CFB,3dyu2z,rodandanga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it.  Right now our recruiting is a bit out of sync for title competition, but its definitely set up well to consistently compete.  What I mean by that, for example, is that we have a QB with 2 years left, a group of running backs and WRs with 3 left, and an OL with 1 left.  So we'll be essentially replacing a group of players every year, but not all of them (though we are evening that out, I don't think it'll all come together right before CPJ retires).  Its a recipe to compete every year, but outside of a ""lightning in a bottle year"" like last year where the replacement hits on every cylinder we're probably not going to have the horses and experience combination we need to compete for a title (like 1990).  We don't get the recruits that can come in and play at a National Championship level as true freshmen.  And that's OK."
CFB,3dyu2z,mjacksongt,7,Mon Jul 20 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"Helfrich has a solid shot. Mariota leaving isn't the end for Oregon, not in the slightest. It's said every time a star QB leaves them, and then they're right back in it.  Also, I'd say BK has a solid shot in the next few years, potentially this year being the best chance."
CFB,3dyu2z,Drunken_Wanderer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Only Chip Kelly has been able to elevate them to that truly elite level. Helfrich has kept them there for now, but his challenge will be to keep it going. That is no easy task."
CFB,3dyu2z,BroYourOwnWay,6,Mon Jul 20 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"Helfrich was directly responsible for getting and developing many of the players that Chip had the benefit of having on his team. He's done a great job since Chip's left at keeping the kind of guys they want coming in, and developing them. The partnership with Nike is just icing on the cake for recruiting.  And also, Kelly wasn't the guy to raise them to that level, a lot of that comes from Bellotti's development of the program coupled with Nike's involvement."
CFB,3dyu2z,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:42 2015 UTC,"Bellotti did a lot of developing, but only once were they real national contenders in his years coaching at Oregon. When Chip took over, the jump was almost immediate, and he kept them there.  Helfrich is a career assistant running a program set up by someone else. Sometimes that works out, sometimes it doesn't."
CFB,3dyu2z,BroYourOwnWay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:59 2015 UTC,A career assistant? The dude is 41 years old.   Edit: Every coach is a career assistant until they're not. And he's one of the 15 youngest coaches in the FBS.
CFB,3dyu2z,3RDnKING,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:58 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
CFB,3dyu2z,BroYourOwnWay,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:13 2015 UTC,Mariota was Helfrich's recruit. I think that this year won't be a huge step down for Oregon that people seem to be expecting. I do think Helfrich is going to bring Oregon's first championship home.
CFB,3dyu2z,puzzledvaliant,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:44 2015 UTC,I don't expect Oregon to take a huge step down this year. I am saying that I wouldn't be surprised if they take gradual steps down the further in the rear view mirror that Chip Kelly gets.
CFB,3dyu2z,BroYourOwnWay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:41 2015 UTC,I don't  think you will fall back too far either. College football  has super high roster turnover across the board.
CFB,3dyu2z,turbodollop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"Only Chip Kelly has been able to elevate them to that truly elite level.   I disagree. I think winning the Pac-12, thumping Florida State by 39, and losing to Ohio State in the NC was certainly elite. It strips Helfrich of a lot of credit to say he ""kept them"" there. They didn't fall into the title game, they were elevated. Marcus was great -- but Helfrich made superb personnel decisions (got Freeman, Tyner, and Marshall all on the field) and coached up a Defense that became dangerous late in the season."
CFB,3dyu2z,jrb52don,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"Last year was absolutely elite. But there is more to ""staying there"" than winning with a veteran laden team lead by the Heisman winner. Your own fanbase was openly questioning Helfrich after the 2013 season."
CFB,3dyu2z,BroYourOwnWay,5,Mon Jul 20 18:42:57 2015 UTC,"Gary Patterson, I'll go out and say that he wins it this year."

CFB,3dyu2z,McMuffler,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"The best bet might be to just look at elite, championship winning program with new coaches.  So Malzahn, Harbaugh, whoever the coach of USC is now, Strong, and maybe Butch."
CFB,3dyu2z,hucareshokiesrul,4,Mon Jul 20 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"BUTCH! Nah, I think Patterson will beat him to it, but we can always dream"
CFB,3dyu2z,mountainoyster,10,Mon Jul 20 18:03:10 2015 UTC,Charlie Strong has the best setup for a championship.
CFB,3dyu2z,19Styx6,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"How do you figure that one? Malzahn has been on his tiptoes the last few years, it's only a matter of time."
CFB,3dyu2z,unbn,4,Mon Jul 20 17:59:18 2015 UTC,"It's more of a Texas can provide the easiest path with all of their resources. Sure, there are other coaches that could/will win their first before Strong, but if I were to choose any school to try to coach to a championship, Texas would probably be my first choice."
CFB,3dyu2z,19Styx6,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"Also, fair or not, they have one less game they have to play to reach the championship. An undefeated B12 champion is NOT going to be left out. Meaning they only need to win 13/14 games instead of 14/15."
CFB,3dyu2z,admiraltarkin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:27:35 2015 UTC,They also play one of the best OOC schedules though. So it evens out. They played 11 P5 matchups last year (BYU as a power).
CFB,3dyu2z,Might_be_right,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:43 2015 UTC,And they play one more conference game than any SEC team.
CFB,3dyu2z,19Styx6,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:23 2015 UTC,With the perks UT has they should be winning every year.  Though they are in the biggest recruiting state along with sharing it with more big teams than anyone else so I guess it balances it out.
CFB,3dyu2z,McMuffler,3,Mon Jul 20 18:06:46 2015 UTC,Thought about it before looking at the comments... I'll say Gary Patterson

Get past Ohio State to get into the playoffs, and we've got a decent shot.  Non-homer pick: Mark Helfrich. Oregon will figure out that final step one of these seasons."

CFB,3dyu2z,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:06 2015 UTC,I think the O-line will be ok if they can get past Louisville. People act like Battle was a first rounder we lost. I think he was a 3rd rounder at best esp. with the baggage he brought. Hyatt looks the part but is a true freshman. If he can make it past Louisville I think they'll pick up steam. My biggest concern on the O-line is depth. And somehow we always have freak injuries.
CFB,3dyu2z,Guyharris29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Plus your front 7 on defense. Their first true test isn't going to be UL, IMO, it'll be ND's who basically has a very solid starting line (obviously) and also is stout in the 2-deep rotation as well."
CFB,3dyu2z,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"L-ville will challenge the O-line with their blitz packages. But yes, that's why I said I wish we had last years defense esp. against ND. Dodd started for suspended Crawford last year against UGA and in the second half they just ran his way and gashed us. I'm hoping he's improved because if not I feel like we'll see much of the same against ND with that moster line"

He wouldn't, so me, I figured that Bo wasn't going to change and he wasn't going to find another gear to take us to the next level.

Depending on how he does this year, he could possibly be willing to leave Oklahoma; and we could certainly throw money at him or anyone."
CFB,3dxllb,DoctorWhosOnFirst,2,Mon Jul 20 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"People who think Stoops isn't a great coach are crazy, but I think y'all would have the same issues with him as Oklahoma.  Which is to say that, while he's a great coach, he's not a coach that's gonna guarantee you a CFP appearance every three years at least.  That's a ludicrous standard, but Saban is gonna be a tough act for anyone to have to follow."
CFB,3dxllb,Old--Scratch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:41 2015 UTC,I think Kirby would be fine. He's learned from Saban for years and knows the program inside and out. He'd know all the young players and I just think it would be a lot smoother transition than bringing someone in.

If you score 35 points in an opponents stadium I think You should expect to win. The D gave up 38 (@USCe 2014) and his head was called for for not rushing Gurley first and goal. He put up record numbers as OC at Georgia
CFB,3dxllb,Hubrishippo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:31:16 2015 UTC,Even though Dantonio has had a lot of success at Michigan State I think we would have at least a shot of getting him back to his alma mater.

As of now, he is an offensive coordinator who has no impact on play calling. I do expect he will get a head coaching job at another school soon though so we should find out how well he can coach without the influence of Malzahn. The main reason I favor Craig is him being a former player at Auburn and his ability to recruit. The same problem with lack of experience exists with Craig though."

He convinced Tommy Tuberville to leave TTU for Cincy, a G5 program, and convinced Buzz Williams to leave Marquette for VT, the worst team in the ACC.

CFB,3dxllb,FoamBornNarwhal,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:38 2015 UTC,I bet ol' Jimbo wouldn't mind reuniting with the Tigers.
CFB,3dxllb,MerryvilleBrother,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty popular opinion, that Jimbo would leave FSU to go back to LSU. But I'm wondering why that is. He spent 7 years at LSU as an OC and won a title there under Saban. But he's going into his 9th year at FSU now and has won a title as the head coach. He has deeper roots in Tallahassee than he does Baton Rouge now.   I'm not saying he wouldn't go back to LSU, but what's the reasoning for leaving FSU, a school he's now been at longer and has done more at, for LSU? Is it just so he can be back in the SEC? Why wouldn't he want to go back to Auburn instead?"
CFB,3dxllb,FoamBornNarwhal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's just a hypothetical. Secondly, yes, he'd be back in the SEC, arguably in the strongest division in the country, coaching for a team consistently in contention for national titles, in a state which produces some of the most high school talent, alone with no other schools to poach from his plate."
CFB,3dxllb,MerryvilleBrother,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's just a hypothetical.   I understand it's hypothetical, but when the Michigan job opened and Les Miles was rumored to be a candidate to take the position, people were also speculating that Jimbo would leave for the LSU job. My question was regarding the answer to the hypothetical.   coaching for a team consistently in contention for national titles   Which is something that can be said for FSU and a few other schools in the SEC (Auburn, UF, Alabama, UGA somewhat). This point by itself doesn't make LSU any more attractive than the other schools mentioned.   in a state which produces some of the most high school talent   He's already coaching in the state that arguably produces the most high school talent so I'm not sure how going from arguably #1 to at best #5 (FL, CA, TX, GA are all ahead but you could make a case for LA over OH) is an upgrade.   alone with no other schools to poach from his plate.   This doesn't exist. Every state is poached by out of state schools. FSU has a commit right now from LA. The second best CB in LA is committed to Alabama. Do you think every school only competes with other in-state schools? LSU may keep more in state talent than other schools, but they still have to fight to keep them home."
CFB,3dxllb,FoamBornNarwhal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"When I said it's just a hypothetical I meant don't take it so seriously, as well as me. You asked why Jimbo would leave FSU for LSU and I gave you some encouraging reasons. Nowhere did I say LSU was the only one who had these things going for them nor that they were any more attractive than anyone else. Stop taking everything I said as an absolute when you know damn well I'm embellishing the truth."
CFB,3dxllb,MerryvilleBrother,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point of my original question. When people discuss Jimbo to LSU, it's almost never because of the reasons you stated and it's almost always because he coached there before and it was the last place he coached before leaving. Other than that, it's not like he's from Louisiana or played football there. I wouldn't expect Mark Richt to jump at the HC job at FSU if it became open because he was our OC for 8 years in the 90's.

I interviewed the owner and the farm manager for the blog and wound up helping them with some media events they ran that week as a matter of courtesy. After that I helped them on Tuesdays and Thursdays at my convenience, planting and harvesting, clearing, fabricating, and even got to lead some local school field trips around the farm.  Just like anything else, you have to vet jobs just like they have to interview you. If you get good feelings, which I did, the partnership is natural and enjoyable.

CFB,3dvsqg,bobby8375,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that means anything.  Casher and Featherston were the light, long-limbed drop-ends that were rotated in on passing downs because they got off the edge and then reached up for a swat.  On standard downs Walker and Edwards were the typical pick, so I'm not surprised they were listed as starters and as such Leonard took Edwards' slot when he left for the Raiders.  What's your issue with the linebackers?  Northrup and Smith did just fine, when you take into account the pressure on the LBs in a 4-2-5."
CFB,3dvsqg,hythloday1,5,Mon Jul 20 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"Featherston didn't do shit after Wake. Casher and Walker rotated a lot and Edwards played inside some.

CFB,3dvsqg,HillsboroughAtheos,3,Mon Jul 20 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"well Northrup is coming off an ACL tear so we'll see how he does this year.  I know rehab for them is much better in recent years but it can change a player.  As far as depth is concerned we've had some transfers out and missed a few on recruiting.  They're loading up this year at that position in recruiting though.  If they can make it through the season healthy we'll be ok, but if not it could get ugly."

CFB,3dvsqg,hythloday1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:42:22 2015 UTC,Our depth at linebacker is awful. And that is assuming Northrup recovers from an ACL tear in the game-that-will-not-be-mentioned and Matthew Thomas comes back from a pretty major off-season shoulder surgery. 4-2-5 will help to alleviate some of that but if those two do miss time and another injury occurs IIRC we will then use walk-ons or have to move someone who is not suited for the position.

Lastly, I figured Mavety would have been listed as the #1 RT outright."
CFB,3dvsqg,MerryvilleBrother,4,Mon Jul 20 01:05:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think Trickett knows what he wants to do with the OL yet.

Lender is talented, but he had an injury that held him back last year, Jacques is talented but not proven yet at this level, and who knows what vickers brings.  WR: I really wish pig or ermon was starting over bobo Wilson. Wilson had stone hands at crucial moments last year. I'mOLine: should be a stout and talented unit even though inexperienced.  DL: the interior slime should be very good, I'm mostly worried about our ends. Will featherston be able to hold up against the run and will walker get a decent pass rush in?  LB: Northrop and smith are talented but one is coming off of an acl tear. Hopefully Matthew Thomas recovers and plays a big role in this season and the juco guy steps up.  DB: I'm a little surprised to see Brutus listed as a starter (Derwin seems likely to grab that spot) but everything else looks good.   Special teams: Aguayo will be solid but Beatty is meh"

The reality, as much as it pains me to say it, is that Golson is really fucking talented and didn't really have turnover issues until the defense fell apart last year and he was asked to carry the team.  Yeah, he has to learn the playbook, but he's not some 18 year old freshman, he'll be fine.  Does anyone really think he's not going to beat out Sean Maguire?  That would be bizarre as he'll to me.

I was looking at the stats and Golson's productivity didn't seem horrendous-- still climbing with TDs and Yardage from 2 years ago. Granted, he turned the ball over WAY too much, which it seems like is because they simply relied too heavily on him (ND fans, maybe you can shed some light on this?)."
CFB,3dvsqg,elgambino,5,Mon Jul 20 03:31:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Golson is a great interim QB and will fit the system well if he can make the reads.

CFB,3dwev7,OleMissRebs16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:13:57 2015 UTC,"Mullen has proved that he's pretty good at player development, so I think he's a stable investment that will yield a good return every two or three years.  By contrast, Freeze is working with more assets than Ole Miss has ever had before (more than Miss. State could ever dream of), and still hasn't been able to put together a 10 win season.  While the ability to get all-star talent like Treadwell may give Freeze a higher ceiling than Mullen, we've seen that when something disrupts their performance, there really doesn't seem to be a plan B, which  also makes Freeze a much more volatile investment - the potential for crashing & burning is very high.    Buying Freeze is essentially a bet that he can do something great this season - that '13 class isn't sticking around forever - and I'm not enough of a gambler to take that bet."
CFB,3dwev7,kingofthejungle223,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:02 2015 UTC,Freeze has only been at Ole Miss for three years and Mullen has been at MSU for 7.  They were basically at the same level this year and it took Freeze under half the time it took Mullen.

CFB,3dwev7,ghetto_draco,3,Mon Jul 20 05:23:13 2015 UTC,I agree with most of this assessment. My pushback is that I think you're overly bullish on the market (Big 12) as a whole. Won't argue that TCU and Baylor have established Top 15 programs. But that leaves little room for the conference to simultaneously host 10-win Texas and Oklahoma State teams in a given year (with OU and KSU inevitably in the mix most years).      Gundy's a great coach and program fit but I see the Cowboys sitting in the middle of the pack the next 5 years.
CFB,3dwev7,jrb52don,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"My view of the Big 12 for the next five years is Oklahoma, Texas, TCU and Baylor with 9-11 wins, Oklahoma State, West Virginia and Kansas State with 8-10, Texas Tech with 5-8 wins, and Iowa State and Kansas with 1-6.  Of course there will always be some outliers (Texas won't have nine wins next year, TCU and/or Baylor will have 12 every now and then), but generally I think it'll look like that. I think that's realistic."
CFB,3dwev7,ghetto_draco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Oklahoma, Texas, TCU and Baylor with 9-11 wins, Oklahoma State, West Virginia and Kansas State with 8-10       In total, you're projecting 7 teams to win 8+ games a year.      That's happened twice in Big 12 history (2003, 2008). Missouri and Kansas were two of the teams included. We're talking OLD Big 12.      I'm not knocking the conference. But as with all conferences, some of those teams ""at the top"" will inevitably win 7 or less games (and go .500 or worse in league). It's parity, Darwinism, whatever you'd like to call it.      Finishing 7th in league doesn't mean it's a bad team. Just like SEC teams don't like playing Arkansas and Pac-12 teams don't like playing Utah. They're good...just not enough room at the top for what you have slated, IMO."
CFB,3dwev7,jrb52don,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I think you missed some of my last comment.   Of course there will always be some outliers   Next year, TCU, Baylor, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Kansas State and probably one other team will have eight wins. That's pretty likely. Texas and/or West Virginia might be one of my outliers and not make it to eight.  Once again, there will be outliers. My win prediction from my last comment with an outlier or two is very realistic."
CFB,3dwev7,ghetto_draco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"I was nitpicking. Reason being, two outliers is the difference between five teams winning 8 games (super reasonable) and seven teams doing so.      I also took 8 as the bottom number of your 8-10 win category, thinking that was your conservative #. May have contributed to my thinking your overall projections were overzealous."
CFB,3dwev7,jrb52don,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"Well I did originally say outliers with an s. Also, those original number projections are like averages. Over the next five years, I predict Oklahoma, Texas, TCU and Baylor will average 10 or more wins, while winning 9-11 games the majority of the time. So yeah, sometimes they'll win 8 or 12 games, but usually it'll be 9-11, averaging out to 10 or more."
CFB,3dwev7,ghetto_draco,4,Mon Jul 20 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"SEC West: Saban: Sell. One of the greats, but he won't be around forever. Freeze: Hold/Buy. Recruiting looks good for them in the future, and Freeze can clearly coach. However, the only reason I say hold is because of the potential fallout from the Tunsil situation. Still a pretty safe buy though. Mullen: Sell. No offense to all the Clangas out there, but the team last year was loaded with upperclassmen, and the smart money says that kind of success isn't very sustainable at State. Miles: Sell. I'd like to believe that the offense will eventually have a great QB, but seeing is believing. The Steele hire isn't very confidence inspiring, but we'll see I guess. Malzahn: Buy. Offense is never a problem, and we just hired one of the best DCs in the game. Sumlin: Buy. The offense is more consistent, and the Chavis hire will definitely help their defense Bielema: Hold. The post says to consider the next 5 years, and I honestly believe Bielema will go to Iowa whenever Ferentz is gone. If he stays at Arkansas for the next 5 years, this is a buy.    SEC East: Richt: Hold. No way does UGA fire him unless the team has a couple of bad seasons. However, they always drop at least a game or two. On the other hand, Pruitt is doing a great job with their defense, and offense hasn't been an issue. Pinkel: Sell. The East is improving, and I don't think consistently good play will be enough to beat some teams that could be elite. Jones: Buy. Great recruiting, and as soon as we have some actual experienced depth (we started a walkon with a torn ACL at Left Tackle last year, and had true freshmen starters on OL and DL) his team should come together nicely. McElwain: Buy. UF with decent results will be a top 10 recruiter every year, and Mac produced pretty awesome results at CSU. Mason: Hold. Vandy is a tough sell for a lot of recruits, and Franklin didn't exactly leave the pantry full. Should be interesting to see what Mason does. Stoops: Buy. I don't know how good Stoops can get UK, but they should at least be better. Spurrier: Sell. The HBC isn't going to coach forever, and he probably should have fired his DC this year."
CFB,3dwev7,70stang,11,Mon Jul 20 10:19:37 2015 UTC,"Richt: hold.  Good asset that just can't seem to breakout.  Definitely has a solid dividend and is consistent, but probably not worth buying into.  Saban: Buy,  while many may not see him as a good value his dividend is sweet.  Easily the best dividend in the conference.  Reinvesting those dividends seems like a great way to build awesome wealth over many years.  Miles:  Hold.  I'm getting a little nervous that he is a sell.  It'll all depend on how his new CDC (Chief Defensive Coordinator) does at maintaining their cost cutting measures.  If costs start creeping up earnings could take a serious hit (as there is a lot more pressure on revenue growth to take place without a lot of revenue generating talent in key positions).  I'm watching this like a hawk and maybe even setting a trailing loss so that I don't get hosed.  Jones:  Hold.  This would be a buy, but I worry that the market is overheated on the stock.  A year ago I'd be all for going long on Jones, but now I think you just wait and see.  McElwain: This would be a great option call IMO.  That way you can limit your losses but capture the growth if it's great.  If not, I'll have to re-evaluate after the season if it's a good value stock with a lot of potential.  Malzahn: Hold.  I am just concerned that the stock is overheated right now.  But long term I still think it has value with the potential of a great dividend in the near future.  But man the price to earnings ratio is the highest in the industry and the highest it's ever been.  Pinkel: Buy, year after year this is the most undervalued stock out there.  While I don't like this years potential for profit growth as I did the previous, nobody seems to appreciate this stocks ability to outperform analyst expectations.  Honestly, this stock has the lowest price/earnings of the whole industry.  Freeze: Hold,  I worry about their ability to carve out market share for the sustainable future, however they have consistently performed.  I'm just not sure what kind of growth potential they have...  And without the dividend, is it worth holding something without a nice moat or high upside.  Maybe I'm wrong - that's why I'm holding this one.  Mullen: Sell.  He's still riding a bit of a peak from last quarter.  I see no room for future growth in an extremely competitive market.  Get out while it still has nice value.  In fact, I'd throw my gains into option puts so that I could have the possibility to profit from the downturn while limiting my exposure if I was somehow wrong.  Bielema: hold leaning towards selling.  I don't see the business growth model being sustainable after losing the kind of talent they had on the expense side.  He's already priced at future growth, but many people are ignoring and dismissing the turnover.  If costs go up can he really grow profits?  That may require some serious revenue growth - which certainly might be possible.  Be ready to get out of this one quick - but not yet.  Stoops: hold.  I like what this stock is doing, but this stock is stuck in a small market with very limited growth potential.  At this point I might be hoping for a buy out more than anything so that I can cash in.  Spurrier: sell everything.  I have liked this stock in the past a lot, but I see this stock only going down in the future.  I might even short this one.  Sumlin: buy.  Honestly think he's the best value of all the stocks.  He's valued less than many stocks that were less successful than him last quarter (and many of those stocks lost much more talent too) by the market.  He has already proven time and again he can give you the revenue, and like google he has recently shown he serious about cutting costs with his new CDC hire.  I think if you are looking for a high growth asset this year - this is your highest potential.  Mason: Sell.  Only because I don't know how this man runs business and I refuse to invest in a business I don't understand."
CFB,3dwev7,Working_onit,4,Mon Jul 20 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"Haha love the legitimate (and on-point) market analysis.      My only discrepancy is on Bielema.  He's a proven, respected CEO and I'd consider 68-24 with 3 Rose Bowl appearances more than a few quarters (7 years) of success. I too question the ""business growth model"" of Arkansas, but believe he's actively changing the fabric of the org.      Setting short term profits aside, I think he's definitively a Buy for the next 5 years based on the historicals we have to go off, and the trajectory of last quarter/season."
CFB,3dwev7,jrb52don,4,Mon Jul 20 05:37:37 2015 UTC,"I just worry about his ability to make acquisitions.  As stated in my thesis of Mullen $MULL, I just think it's become too competitive of a market for them to all be successful.  One of the most important things to remember when investing is past results do not equal future success.  $BIEL has less talent around him than most of the other high value assets in the industry.  I just see everyone else eating into his profits.  Sure $BIEL may have better earnings than before, but I think he's overpriced because the analysts are predicting far too much for his earnings.  Meaning, more than likely at the end of the quarter the stock price for $BIEL will only go down.  If you still believe he's a good long bet, that's when you make your move.  Otherwise hold, because his future predicted earnings are already priced in.  I should have mentioned in my thesis on Mason (stock symbol $MASN) that if you like to dabble in penny stocks, that is your play."
CFB,3dwev7,Working_onit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:20:59 2015 UTC,"Very well put. But if Arkansas wins 8 games and thumps a quality OOC opponent in their bowl (not out of the question in my mind), I don't see $BIEL price dropping. So I'll buy now. I could be wrong, but I'll take the chance and go long on him. Re: the market, I agree it's competitive. But I'll sell on Miles and Mullen in 5 yr. outlook -- and see Arkansas capitalizing on some of that market capture. Not just in wins/profits, but also in recruiting/business model."

CFB,3dwev7,ExternalTangents,3,Mon Jul 20 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"I was saying that since Muschamp never had HC experience, much less in what fanboys say is the ""best conference"".

Not a diss at him personally, more so just at the difference in level of competition between the MWC and SEC may prove to be a struggle.

CFB,3dwev7,theshnig,3,Mon Jul 20 10:01:20 2015 UTC,"I think, if most of the UF fan comments are to be believed, that McElwain has a fairly large job cut out for him at the moment just because Florida wasn't left in the greatest position depth-wise and he'll have to restock quick. The program itself is still one that recruits want to go to - McElwain will have to capitalize on that.   That said, You guys might be on the struggle bus for a year or two before it turns around.

He's not fucked up what Harbaugh built, which is easier said than done. But he hasn't taken them to any new heights? And I feel as though if you're given a successful Stanford program, and you are good enough to not mess it all up, it's a well-oiled machine that sells itself.

CFB,3dwev7,theshnig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"Saban - Hold. When you're competing for a National Championship nearly every year, it's tough to say ""buy"". Kind of like a stock with $1,000/share value. It gets pricy to buy more and there isn't a lot of room from growth.  What Saban should do about this: Nothing. He's figured out how to keep competing at the top. Keep recruiting, keep winning, and keep the game plan fresh.  Richt - Hold. You don't fire a coach that can win as much as he does. He's in a very strong position in the SEC East this year. He needs to get over the Missouri hump and get to the SECCG.  What he needs to fix: The annual ""oh, we should have won that!"" game. You have to win the winnable games. This seems like the only thing that's held Georgia back for a while, but when you're so close every year, you don't want to get rid of the coach that got you there.  McElwain - Buy conservatively. UF, when good, dominates recruiting in the state of Florida. If McElwain can do this, it's easy to see them being back on top of the East very soon. For now, he's got to make due with what he has and sell the program as best he can. Buy early and buy conservative because if he can pull it off, his stock price is going through the roof.  What he'll need to fix: A lot. The cupboards are a little bare at Florida, but that can be fixed soon enough. The short term plan for the McEltrain needs to be to stabilize what he has, weather the coming season as well as possible, and start bringing in the recruits.  Bielema - Buy. If I'm a recruit right now, I'm paying attention to this guy because of his personality. It's clear he's a ""player's coach"" and that he's having an impact at Arkansas.  What he needs to do: Repeat and improve on last year. He made a leap from a 3-win team to a 7-win team. If he can maintain the enormous progress he's shown there and come away with another win to boot, you've got a seriously good looking future for the Hogs.  Edit for more:  Derek Mason: I like him, but I'd sell Vanderbilt as a program. Vanderbilt had a wonderful opportunity in James Franklin to claw their way into relevance, but much of that left when he did. Mason doesn't just have a hard job coaching week-to-week in the season against teams that he's outmatched by, but also selling an SEC program that doesn't have a ton of support from the fans.  What he can do to change things: If you can't find a way to be great on your own, imitate greatness. Franklin helped build support by making Vandy ""cool"" - The Anchor Down motto generated some excitement for the program and an upward trajectory for them helped it grow. The team may have lost the momentum, but the opportunity is still there. Also, find a way to sell the program to the smarter athletes. They're few and far between, certainly, but when your school has one of the finest educations anywhere to offer, you sell it. Mason has a big job and I don't believe anyone envies his position in the CFB coaching world.  Les Miles - Option-Buy on ""Crazy shit he's going to say"" and ""clock mismanagement"" for the biggest returns in the SEC.  What he needs to do: Keep winning, keep staying batshit insane, and try to manage the clock a little better (or don't).   Butch Jones - Hold (I know you're shocked I didn't homer-buy this one) If you weren't already invested in the Big Orange Hype Train, now's a bit too late to get in on it. His stock price for now has peaked and is either going to be a further success at this point or a massive disappointment. The team, undoubtedly, has improved since he took the reigns from former head coach Derek Dooley, who claims his spirit animal is Disney's ""Goofy"". The big question marks still remain on the offensive line. Having Dobbs in at quarterback has helped mask some of the problems of the O-line, but he'll need to have more confidence in his ability to stand in the pocket and throw if this team is going to put more points on the board offensively. The team has improved massively under Butch, but this year will also present a fairly difficult schedule with games against Oklahoma, Arkansas, Bama, Georgia, and Missouri (who we have yet to beat since their entry into the SEC).   What he needs to do: Win. Win the bigger games. Beating South Carolina is fun, but you have to find a way to beat Missouri, Georgia, and Florida as well (or at least two of them) of we're going to claw into the SEC Championship Game. Having welcomed back and embraced former Volunteer football players to the program, recruited amazingly, and shown improvement on the football field, the only thing that remains for Butch to do is WIN. If the games are managed correctly and the recruits keep coming, UT could be dangerous. This, however, is the 3rd year of the Butch Jones reign and this season represents a critical juncture for the team. This is year 3 and this is make-it or break-it time. If he can get the team to 8 or 9 total wins, bet the farm. Until then, hold steady.  Hugh Freeze - Buy conservatively. Since he's been at the helm of Ole Miss, his team has gone 7, 8, and 9 wins on his respective seasons and improved to 5 conference wins. The bowl game may have been a little embarrassing for the Rebels, but they garnered a lot of attention starting the season 7-0. They'll need to do more than just knock off a couple of ranked teams in the SEC West to compete for National Championships, but they're in maybe the toughest division of any conference in CFB.  What he needs to do: Improve consistency. Beating #3 Alabama and then losing to unranked Arkansas tells me there are major problems here with consistency in some way. Don't one good season be the pinnacle before dropping back. This team is capable of being more than an occasional giant-killer. It'll be up to Hugh to get it there.  Dan Mullen - Buy! With 6 seasons under his belt and a steadily improving team, Dan has taken the Dogs (literally) of the SEC West, put Stark-Vegas on the map, and made this maybe the most exciting program in the SEC. Mississippi state knocked off 3 top-ten ranked teams only to fall to Alabama and Ole Miss at the end of the season and lose a bowl game to Georgia Tech. I think the two losses late in the season took some wind out of their sails, but I believe this team comes back next year with a chip on their shoulder and the maturity to handle a loss and move on from it. Unfortunately, not everyone from that team is returning. I think Mullen will be able to spin last year's success into a marked improvement in recruiting. It's a shame this team has so few returning starters. Still, I think in the long-term this is a buy because Mullen at Mississippi state is going to wind up being in a stable position to coach there as long as he wants to.  What he needs to do: Manage the hype and the hate, keep the players grounded, and keep them from panicking before the big games and you've got a team that could potentially knock Bama off their SEC-West throne in due time. I'll be pulling for this team to do just that. His biggest challenge is going to be continuing to recruit, and he may have a massive drop-off this season, but I think that he'll pull it together and meet some realistic expectations on the field, and keep his recruiting efforts more consistent.  Kevin Sumlin - Hold or Sell. I'm leaning to Sell. Sumlin's Aggies have gone backwards since their explosive entrance into the SEC West and he'll need to stabilize what he has before he can start improving again. The tools are there, however. Being the only SEC team in Texas gives him an edge on recruiting that he'll need to leverage if he wants to get back to an 11-win season. I would attribute some of the regression in wins to the fact that the SEC West's traditional punching bags (Sorry guys, you know it's true) are improving a lot and the Aggies have taken a few beating because of it.  He'll have to keep hammering away at recruiting in Texas, but should start branching out into the rest of the country to see if he can pull in some guys that aren't in the hottest recruiting beds. It's hard to say sell when the program and he are in a position to be great, but the trajectory is downhill at the moment."

CFB,3dtzgg,cycling_and_cfb,74,Sun Jul 19 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of buzz around Missouri and their recent success. The truth is, you'll see a lot of people who are fans of teams outside of the SEC defend Missouri, and a lot of fans of teams in the SEC dislike them.   For those who don't like how the SEC is portrayed as the most dominant conference, use Missouri as proof of how a middle of the road Big 12 team can join the conference and be fairly successful.  And obviously, people who root for teams in the SEC don't like them because they came from outside the conference and within two years made it to the championship game.   So I think that's were the hate stems from, although not many people are going to admit to that. What I see is a lot of Missouri upset because they think they deserve more respect, and to a degree I think they aren't given quite as much as they have deserved.  They are a very good team that does what they need to do to make it to the championship game. They win games when they need to, and don't lose games they shouldn't (in conference). But I don't feel sympathy when they are upset they are overlooked to win the East. The two years they went, there was a better team in the East and they  haven't won the SEC.   When they do win the SEC, or truly dominate the East and then get overlooked, I'll be the first one to side with Missouri. That hasn't been the case though. They are a really good team, who has done the job they needed to do to be successful. They belong in the conference, and I'm really excited to see how things go when the East is back up because it's going to be way more interesting with Missouri in there."
CFB,3dtzgg,ac2curse,12,Sun Jul 19 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a pretty accurate description. I think you or Georgia probably were better teams in your respective year missing out on the conference game. But we won the games we needed to, and you both didn't.

It's just a boring national narrative.   Most smart mizzou fans know that the team is very good but should temper expectations until the offense has answered some of the pending questions."

CFB,3dtzgg,JustaGangsta,10,Sun Jul 19 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"I demand some respect which it seems we gained through last season despite sucking. So I don't complain here anymore. I think we gained it because our team was downright bad but had the drive to just win despite being bad. They just had that push to get it done in games. People saw that and said ""there goes Missouri somehow winning like usual."""
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"The offense was shit, the defense was probably the best it's ever been."
CFB,3dtzgg,JumpingPotato1,8,Sun Jul 19 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"Well, ol x-25 has an axe to grind with the sec so I'm sure that played some part in it."
CFB,3dtzgg,Yesh,15,Sun Jul 19 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Suddenly? Bro we've been shit on for the entirety of my life. Granted the first half of my life was justifiable, but since After Corby we have been nothing if not at least decent. People look at the year we hit numero uno for a few weeks and use it as proof of how we suck. Somehow?  I'm an old timer by the standards of this sub, so I will always be expecting to be let down, but I can't fathom why we draw ire. Maybe I should be happy. I mean, even if we are getting basically CFB's equivalent of X-Pac Heat at least people are aware of us!"
CFB,3dtzgg,clown-penisdotfart,25,Sun Jul 19 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"Clown-penis.fart is right, guys.  Now I can say I've typed that sentence at least once in my life."
CFB,3dtzgg,DafoeFoSho,6,Sun Jul 19 17:15:36 2015 UTC,Upvote for X-Pac heat.
CFB,3dtzgg,Twistify804,42,Sun Jul 19 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"It's to preemptively discount us if we win and mock us if we lose the division.   SEC fans, especially in the East, have been putting us in that lose-lose situation since we entered the conference.   When we lost to Georgia in 2012, when we had about 7 starters hurt? Mizzou ""wasn't ready for the SEC."" When we beat Georgia in 2013 when they had a few injuries? Didn't count.   Honestly, it's kinda childish.   Also, I don't even think we're going to win the East this year. Two of our better defensive linemen won't play - one was kicked off the team and another was in a serious car wreck - and our offense is the physical embodiment of ??????"
CFB,3dtzgg,TheTurduckenfrank,15,Sun Jul 19 17:36:18 2015 UTC,it's kinda childish   Welcome to football fandom
CFB,3dtzgg,Yesh,6,Sun Jul 19 19:51:42 2015 UTC,Y'all got the job done and Pinkel's been  consistent no matter the 'weakness' of the east.
CFB,3dtzgg,Dat_Foig,12,Sun Jul 19 18:47:23 2015 UTC,SEC circle jerking. See his comment about the polls. As if those even matter now with the playoff committee in place.
CFB,3dtzgg,sitdownstandup,27,Sun Jul 19 17:07:46 2015 UTC,Too bad Kentucky is going to win the East.  Why are you laughing?   Stop it! Stop laughing!
CFB,3dtzgg,UKAndrew,5,Sun Jul 19 18:20:12 2015 UTC,We will!   Be afraid for there are dozens of us! Dozens!
CFB,3dtzgg,TaylorAGreene,3,Sun Jul 19 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"Silly Kentucky fan, still thinking there are divisions in basketball."
CFB,3dtzgg,Longvols,64,Mon Jul 20 00:12:35 2015 UTC,I can realistically see them losing 4 of those games.
CFB,3dtzgg,bananashammock,15,Sun Jul 19 13:59:52 2015 UTC,As long as we don't have to play the powerhouse of Indiana
CFB,3dtzgg,IgotAGoldfish,19,Sun Jul 19 17:22:19 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing.
CFB,3dtzgg,Celov112,59,Sun Jul 19 14:11:46 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing for the past 2 years too...
CFB,3dtzgg,the_zero,43,Sun Jul 19 14:47:55 2015 UTC,They'll lose to Vandy and Connecticut and beat everyone else.
CFB,3dtzgg,polydorr,27,Sun Jul 19 15:52:39 2015 UTC,Team chaos wins once again!
CFB,3dtzgg,Mufro,5,Sun Jul 19 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seems like most look at Georgia to take the East, but the rest of the conference is in a bit of a toss up. No one really knows who is gonna stand out as second, or someone to be the challenger to Georgia. I'm sure someone will, but seems like a fairly even group of teams in the East going into the season."
CFB,3dtzgg,Alexlsonflre,39,Sun Jul 19 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"I just don't know how to feel about Missouri.  I mean they're legit.  But we're better.  But we keep fucking up and let Missouri go to the SEC championship.  And then they lose.  It's like, I'm mad, but I have no right to be."
CFB,3dtzgg,OneManGOONsquad,9,Sun Jul 19 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"If the situations were reversed, I'd be mad as hell too."
CFB,3dtzgg,Zoltrahn,34,Sun Jul 19 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that they will have a loss to either Kentucky or Tennessee this year.  I think Kentucky may shock some people and make a bowl game this year, and Tennessee isn't someone to overlook either.  Add in that both of these are also away games."
CFB,3dtzgg,bluegrassborn,31,Sun Jul 19 13:58:07 2015 UTC,I also wouldn't be so quick to assume wins against Florida and South Carolina.  Pick one.
CFB,3dtzgg,slapknuts,8,Sun Jul 19 15:56:14 2015 UTC,Tennessee is a home game.
CFB,3dtzgg,Aditup-MIZ,3,Sun Jul 19 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misread the OP, my bad."
CFB,3dtzgg,bluegrassborn,17,Sun Jul 19 16:06:02 2015 UTC,Actually it was incorrect when he originally posted it and you were correct from that standpoint. Guess OP was so excited to shit on an SEC team he forgot his accuracy. (just like our QB)
CFB,3dtzgg,Aditup-MIZ,3,Sun Jul 19 16:08:35 2015 UTC,What are Mizzou fans expecting from Mauk this year? I know last season was a let down after how well he'd played in relief the season before
CFB,3dtzgg,Dopeplex,16,Sun Jul 19 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"I expect nothing, and I still plan on being disappointed."
CFB,3dtzgg,v1ct0r1us,4,Sun Jul 19 18:04:20 2015 UTC,I feel like you just summed up life as a Mizzou fan.
CFB,3dtzgg,jklharris,11,Sun Jul 19 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"I already have UK slated as a bowl team. They had some solid moments last year and they should only improve. Stoops has been working wonders there.  That being said, I don't think the Vols lose to them, but I'm a little biased there, too."
CFB,3dtzgg,Drunken_Wanderer,15,Sun Jul 19 16:38:54 2015 UTC,somone is talking about us. what's wrong?
CFB,3dtzgg,Mufro,164,Sun Jul 19 16:53:25 2015 UTC,They always do.  It drives me insane.  I swear it was part of the deal when they signed on.
CFB,3dtzgg,one-hour-photo,29,Sun Jul 19 13:23:25 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, Missouri didn't win the East the last two years because it had weak non-conference opponents and an easier draw from the West. Last year, Missouri won because a better Georgia managed to drop two games to South Carolina and Florida teams that Missouri beat. The year before, Missouri won because an arguably better South Carolina team dropped games to Georgia and Tennessee teams that Missouri beat."
CFB,3dtzgg,phillybadger,21,Sun Jul 19 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"South Carolina got the two worst teams from the West in 2013, but we're still the team that had the ""easy schedule"" in everybody's minds.  It's fucking stupid."
CFB,3dtzgg,SausagePETEza,12,Sun Jul 19 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"It can't be ""always"" though.  Don't they have to cycle through all the teams?  Avoiding the top ones now just means they'll have to pay the pied piper later.  If it was me I'd rather parcel it out, playing one of the ""top"" teams from the other division each year instead of getting hit with 2 at once."
CFB,3dtzgg,spartanburt,6,Sun Jul 19 15:28:39 2015 UTC,It isn't always. But Tennessee fans can complain because of the west we will play Arkansas + 1 team every year and they well play Alabama + 1 team every year. Also no it's not always. Our first year of the three so far we played Alabama and the Texas A&M team that beat them that year.
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,68,Sun Jul 19 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah last year's schedule was even more embarrassing.   Their first 4 games were vs:   South Dakota St @ Toledo UCF Indiana (They somehow lost)   No LSU, Alabama, or Auburn last year either."
CFB,3dtzgg,kurt_carlson,72,Sun Jul 19 13:46:31 2015 UTC,HEY SDSU is a legit team! They probably could beat an FBS team this year!
CFB,3dtzgg,aaninja64,84,Sun Jul 19 15:16:20 2015 UTC,Like Kansas?
CFB,3dtzgg,kurt_carlson,86,Sun Jul 19 15:49:13 2015 UTC,They could probs beat Ohio State but they aren't scheduled to play. I guess we'll never know.
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,21,Sun Jul 19 15:51:31 2015 UTC,I guess Ohio State is just afraid to play such a good team.
CFB,3dtzgg,Drunken_Wanderer,19,Sun Jul 19 18:14:17 2015 UTC,He said FBS.
CFB,3dtzgg,jayhawx19,9,Sun Jul 19 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"That's the one where teams get to play in and win BCS/NY6 bowls, right Notre Dame?"
CFB,3dtzgg,arrow_dynamics,5,Sun Jul 19 17:19:16 2015 UTC,Yeah they really are no joke. There are several FBS teams they could beat or give a run for their money. Including a few P5 teams.
CFB,3dtzgg,duckterrorist,10,Sun Jul 19 15:51:07 2015 UTC,Whoosh
CFB,3dtzgg,FreeGurley,13,Sun Jul 19 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"So you're saying Georgia has 3 losses this year? Because we'd need at least 3 to lose the conference if these predictions hold up. And in my opinion, Mizzou is going to split the Miss St and Tennessee game"
CFB,3dtzgg,GAbrewdawg,9,Sun Jul 19 15:50:57 2015 UTC,I'm surprised OP had Mizzou losing to Arkansas and not Miss St. I think both will be high caliber teams this year that would give anybody in the East a hard time.
CFB,3dtzgg,SoutheastConquerer,7,Sun Jul 19 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's cause we're ""rivals"" so we play them tougher, duh. /s"
CFB,3dtzgg,GAbrewdawg,13,Sun Jul 19 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the historic ""Onslaught in the Ozarks"" rivalry."
CFB,3dtzgg,TheTurduckenfrank,7,Sun Jul 19 17:54:45 2015 UTC,That's... That's a way better name.
CFB,3dtzgg,euphomptus,10,Sun Jul 19 19:56:25 2015 UTC,I almost forgot about Indiana beating Missouri. This made my day!
CFB,3dtzgg,BoxScoreHero,26,Sun Jul 19 16:34:09 2015 UTC,And then you remembered who your head coach is.
CFB,3dtzgg,TheTurduckenfrank,33,Sun Jul 19 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we get crap for it, but it isn't like we had much of a choice. Moving conferences meant we had to quickly fill our OOC spots, and most good schools have these things figured out years in advance.   It's not like we're averse to playing good schools. We had a home-and-home with ASU a few years back, and people were pretty high on Indiana when that series was scheduled."
CFB,3dtzgg,DkS_FIJI,85,Sun Jul 19 14:40:57 2015 UTC,People have never been high on Indiana.
CFB,3dtzgg,DarthFluttershy_,28,Sun Jul 19 15:09:48 2015 UTC,That's not true. They were totally legit in 1945...
CFB,3dtzgg,Nebraska_Actually,28,Sun Jul 19 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Even though they beat Missouri at Missouri last season, they still finished dead last in the /r/theb1g power rankings."
CFB,3dtzgg,BoseSounddock,21,Sun Jul 19 15:15:44 2015 UTC,That's just impressive
CFB,3dtzgg,MorsMiles,10,Sun Jul 19 15:30:23 2015 UTC,They also were on like their 5th string QB for most of the year due to injuries. It's not nearly as bad of a team as last years record would show.
CFB,3dtzgg,Aditup-MIZ,14,Sun Jul 19 17:28:16 2015 UTC,They also got some bad injuries midway through the season. (not making excuses.)
CFB,3dtzgg,Nebraska_Actually,16,Sun Jul 19 15:52:12 2015 UTC,Yeah you shouldn't be losing to Indiana anyway but they were a much better and healthier team in your game than they were the rest of the season.
CFB,3dtzgg,Inspector-34,14,Sun Jul 19 15:56:22 2015 UTC,At least someone is talking about us. That happens like twice a year in this Sub
CFB,3dtzgg,g_mo821,6,Sun Jul 19 15:33:29 2015 UTC,Your OOC doesn't even any better
CFB,3dtzgg,RegionalBias,7,Sun Jul 19 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"Jesus, their 2017 is something special: 09/02 - Missouri State 09/16 - Purdue 09/23 - at UConn 10/21 - Idaho    Imagine the taunting if both of the major programs in Indiana beat Mizzou. (what? No, that other team is in the ACC, how could they be in Indiana)"
CFB,3dtzgg,pinwheelpride,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:45 2015 UTC,Honest question here: why does moving conferences mean you have to fill your OOC spots? Does it renege on all previous commitments?
CFB,3dtzgg,ProbablyNotSeth,5,Sun Jul 19 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, there was a reigning BCS bowl champ and future SECEast champ in there."
CFB,3dtzgg,tron423,7,Sun Jul 19 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"No LSU, Alabama, or Auburn last year either.   It's almost like we're in the East or something."
CFB,3dtzgg,NolaHoosier,4,Sun Jul 19 20:53:19 2015 UTC,We were a very strong team who could play with anyone with out healthy QB
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,5,Sun Jul 19 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"We played Alabama our first year. And it was the SEC that have us Arkansas as a permanent rival, so it's not our fault that the only other SEC west team we play happens to be weak in comparison to the rest."
CFB,3dtzgg,Masuerta,14,Sun Jul 19 17:38:10 2015 UTC,; _ ; I just realized we dont play them this year
CFB,3dtzgg,Mufro,9,Sun Jul 19 15:32:39 2015 UTC,How does that make you feel?
CFB,3dtzgg,Masuerta,13,Sun Jul 19 16:55:55 2015 UTC,Like we've totally cut ties with the big 12 now...
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,5,Sun Jul 19 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"I really wish they didn't force us not to be cross-divisional protected rivals. They're doing it to make us more a part of the SEC faster, but it also makes us not really care about who we are playing. I don't give a shit about Arkansas and I don't know anyone who does. People liked playing A&M at least."
CFB,3dtzgg,baeb66,15,Sun Jul 19 18:52:13 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me.
CFB,3dtzgg,MDO4KD,73,Sun Jul 19 15:07:11 2015 UTC,So this is what we're doing today? It's not even 10AM yet and we're already fighting
CFB,3dtzgg,2011StlCards,34,Sun Jul 19 14:47:35 2015 UTC,It is always Mizzou-hating time in r/CFB! Haven't you noticed that yet?
CFB,3dtzgg,Dkjq58,15,Sun Jul 19 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously, what's up with that? And judging by your username your a also a Cardinals fan. It's the same way they get hammered on /r/baseball all the time."
CFB,3dtzgg,2011StlCards,16,Sun Jul 19 17:15:51 2015 UTC,I think its a combination of leaving the Big 12 and winning the SEC East 2 of the first 3 years. They both incite some hatred individually and together they turn into some serious shit
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,7,Sun Jul 19 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"We get loved and hated. SEC fans are all ""look, we have a great team in Missouri, so that continues to makes us great"" but then they also despise us for coming in and winning two SEC East titles in 3 years. Then the Big XII despises us for leaving the conference but they still love to say ""look at how Missouri went in there and is doing so well against you guys.""  It's just a what argument are people trying to make today thing."
CFB,3dtzgg,3IIIIIIIID--------,10,Sun Jul 19 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"To me, you're one of the good guys in the SEC.  Keep it up and win the east again this year."
CFB,3dtzgg,js155306,3,Sun Jul 19 17:45:23 2015 UTC,Nice flair
CFB,3dtzgg,Leap_Day_William,12,Sun Jul 19 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"I see South Carolina, Mississippi State, and Tennessee as toss up games. Odds are they lose at least one of those, along with Georgia and Arkansas. Even if they don't, 10-2 might not be enough to win the east this year if one of the losses is to Georgia."
CFB,3dtzgg,skodi,18,Sun Jul 19 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"What people haven't figured out yet, is that when we are setup with an ""easy"" schedule and hyped is when things fall apart for us.  We've already lost what would probably have been an all-SEC defensive end for the year due to life threatening injuries.  That's just the start. Give it time the wheels will come off.  We seem to play better from an overlooked, under dog standpoint."
CFB,3dtzgg,the_zero,8,Sun Jul 19 14:31:58 2015 UTC,They never should have allowed you in the East because I fear you are our doppleganger. Same city name and everything. Goddamned Missouri Gamecocks...
CFB,3dtzgg,skodi,7,Sun Jul 19 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, they are forcing the Arkansas rivalry on us. But so far our games have been close enough with enough on the line, for both teams, that I really feel like a budding rivalry is starting.  Plus you add in the 2005 Independence Bowl and we might have something."
CFB,3dtzgg,Mufro,6,Sun Jul 19 15:05:40 2015 UTC,I would've been happy to keep A&M on the schedule.
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,4,Sun Jul 19 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"We should have kept A&M on our schedule. We had more history with them than any West team and they with us over any East team. But they're forcing Arkansas and South Carolina (that's who they got, right?) on us because they wanted to force us to more a part of the SEC.  Then they ruined any chances by making us play Arkansas for the Shelter Insurance Border Line Rivalry Trophy in the Border Line Rivalry Brought to you by Shelter Insurance. I mean, fuck, the trophy has their god damned logo on it. I will never have pride in fighting for a corporate sponsorship."
CFB,3dtzgg,MDO4KD,5,Sun Jul 19 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm glad every year when we get ""slighted"" in pre season polls."
CFB,3dtzgg,SouthernTiger1,2,Sun Jul 19 14:53:10 2015 UTC,One minor correction Harold was/is a DT and not a DE.
CFB,3dtzgg,RobertNeyland,11,Sun Jul 19 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"2 corrections, the BYU is a neutral site game, not a home game and the Tennessee game is at home, not on the road.  I could see them only losing 2-3 games, but they've lost a lot on their d-line and also took a hit to their offensive playmakers.   I agree that they, again, have the easiest path to the championship on paper, but there are a lot of question marks in the East this year, so I think it is a bit silly to project that things are going to pan out like it looks like on paper with absolute certainty.   If Carolina's DC pulls his shit together, BYU ends up having a monster run game, Florida's o-line gels by mid-season and Grier plays to his potential, and Tennessee/Arkansas maintain their trajectory, then Missouri could end up with a slew of losses.   It is hard to say at this point."
CFB,3dtzgg,n9ucs,28,Sun Jul 19 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"They will easily start off 4-0 and despite those all being easy games they will rocket up the polls because the voters don't seem to care about competition when it involves the SEC, that only applies to the rest of the P5.   Maybe but probably not. Mizzou gets no respect from anyone."
CFB,3dtzgg,gryffon5147,10,Sun Jul 19 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment that Kentucky or Tennessee have gotten a lot better recently and might pull out a win.   South Carolina and Florida are both far from sure things, given the usual quality of their players and coaching staffs.   Mississippi State was for a while ranked the #1 team in the nation and returning a Heisman candidate quarterback with a pretty good coach that knows how to get the most of his players.   BYU can surprise even the most stalwart teams.   Although I can see the reasons for optimism, I'd hardly call it ""barely breaking a sweat"". While it's not the SEC West, it's a long hard road ahead for Mizzou."
CFB,3dtzgg,the_zero,9,Sun Jul 19 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its funny how a schedule can generate outrage when none of the games have been played. No wins are guaranteed. There are upsets every Saturday, and the bookies and talking heads can't predict the future. No one thought Mizzou would be in the running the past two years."
CFB,3dtzgg,Mikerk,9,Sun Jul 19 14:54:45 2015 UTC,I want 9 conference games.   Only 2 cross division with 1 always the same is stupid.
CFB,3dtzgg,osufanboy23,2,Sun Jul 19 15:56:01 2015 UTC,I think you're the first SEC fan that I've seen who wants 9 conference games.
CFB,3dtzgg,anshr01,3,Sun Jul 19 18:12:31 2015 UTC,Most of the SEC that doesn't have a permanent OOC rivalry wants 9 conference games. Alabama for example. The new 8 conference + 1 P5 OOC is a compromise solution for those of us who would lose OOC scheduling availability if we were to add the 9th conference game.  I myself prefer the 8+1 or even an 8+2 format. I have no idea why other conferences are so insistent on having us and the ACC add the 9th game.
CFB,3dtzgg,Literally_JaclynGlen,24,Sun Jul 19 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"BYU (9-1) *Neutral Site, Kansas City   Lol"
CFB,3dtzgg,ajvl,24,Sun Jul 19 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"Texas vs USC *Neutral site game: Rose Bowl, Pasadena   Notre Dame vs LSU *Neutral site game: Sugar Bowl, New Orleans    There are actually a lot of these"
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,3,Sun Jul 19 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not neutral site at all. But they're doing a ""neutral"" for us and home for them deal and making that Neutral in KC to try and appease the KC fans more after no longer being in the middle of MU vs. KU and MU vs. K-State (and kinda MU vs. NU)."
CFB,3dtzgg,Literally_JaclynGlen,3,Sun Jul 19 18:44:36 2015 UTC,Thank the football gods you weren't in the Big 12 when KU killed storming the field.
CFB,3dtzgg,Ndlaxfan,32,Sun Jul 19 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't know that by watching the SEC Media day coverage... They spent about 30 seconds per team in the east talking about each team's chances to win the East and how its basically already Georgia's, but then they completely left out Mizzou and didn't mention them."
CFB,3dtzgg,skodi,31,Sun Jul 19 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"That's par for the course for Mizzou, regardless of our conference affiliation and standing."
CFB,3dtzgg,MDO4KD,20,Sun Jul 19 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly it pisses me off, but I think it's for the best. We play like dog shit when people expect us to win"

Then Missouri beat them and..... silence  The best part is it happened with the Kentucky and Tennessee games as well. Missouri beat them and..... nothing  The irony being that if Arkansas had beaten Missouri, they would have vaulted into the top 25 and been the hot team to follow (especially after close losses to both A&M and Alabama)  But.... Missouri beat them so the narrative went that Arkansas was never very good. Isn't that convenient?"

CFB,3dtzgg,hythloday1,12,Sun Jul 19 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"Here's a different way of looking at the three teams I think are best in position to win the SEC East:     Georgia Mizzou Tennessee    Georgia --- Home Road   Mizzou Road --- Home   Tennessee Home Road ---   Cross-Div A v Alabama v Miss St v Arkansas   Cross-Div B @ Auburn @ Arkansas @ Alabama    I don't really see a big advantage for any of these teams here.  I suppose if I had to, I'd say Mizzou's cross-divisional opponents are the easiest, and Georgia's the toughest, but that's not a lot to go on.  I think it's much more likely that the East will be decided on a) if one of these three beats the other two, and/or b) slip-ups against the other four teams in the East."
CFB,3dtzgg,SharksFanAbroad,13,Sun Jul 19 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"Cross-Div A&B could easily result in 0-2 for UGA, 1-1 for Tenn and 2-0 for Mizzou. That's quite significant."

CFB,3dtzgg,SharksFanAbroad,3,Sun Jul 19 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly I'm surprised by the lack of love Miss State is getting, though it's probably attributable to their tapering off as the season waned; losing 3 of their final 4. That said, they deserve more credit than they've gotten."
CFB,3dtzgg,1baussguy,5,Sun Jul 19 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"Mississippi State was great last year. This year, besides Dak Prescott they bring very little pieces back. http://www.philsteele.com/Blogs/2015/JAN15/DBJan23.html They're 121 in the country for returning starters (which includes a returning kicker and punter). Obviously though, anyone can be good - that's college football."
CFB,3dtzgg,PawlTide,4,Sun Jul 19 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"They only return 7 starters between both units this year, and that's the main reason. Personally, I feel like they were the result of a perfect storm coming together in having so many seniors in last year's class. Not that they won't be decent, but it seems very doubtful that they'll be elite or compete for the division this year."
CFB,3dtzgg,the_zero,4,Sun Jul 19 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"Just the way the cookie crumbles. UGA missed out on playing Bama for several years with some scheduling mixups by the SEC.   Plus, we don't know just how good or bad State and Arkansas will be. Both could end up being top-3 teams in the SECW"
CFB,3dtzgg,hythloday1,3,Sun Jul 19 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"Well okay, let's say that happens.  Let's also say that Mizzou is secretly not that good, as seems to be the hypothesis, and they lose to both Tennessee and Georgia.  The SEC East divisional champ is then the winner of the Georgia-Tennessee game: if it's Tennessee then they're 7-1 and Mizzou is 6-2; if it's Georgia then they're all 6-2 but they own both tie-breakers.  In other words, even in the scenario you posit, it's still going to come down to if one of the top three beats the other two, and making sure there's no slip-ups against the remaining four."
CFB,3dtzgg,SausagePETEza,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, it could also easily not result like that."

CFB,3dtzgg,tk_fourtwentyone,7,Sun Jul 19 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"We're picked third in the East behind Georgia and Tennessee. Vegas has our O/U win total at 7.5. Harold Brantley, the anchor on our defense, is out for the whole season bc he was in a serious car accident last month. We lost half of our backfield when Josey graduated (Hansbrough is still around). We have virtual unknowns at WR, and our QB Mauk is less than predictable. The school doesn't get to pick the opponents from the west, and since when are Arkansas and Miss St. cupcakes? Everyone was balls deep in them last season. Not sure where all this salt is coming from.  Edit: Murphy, not Josey"
CFB,3dtzgg,blackertai,5,Sun Jul 19 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Well, as a Georgia fan, I can say I honestly really like Mauk."
CFB,3dtzgg,tk_fourtwentyone,2,Sun Jul 19 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, he's a decent quarterback. But he's inconsistent; lots of peaks and valleys. He can win it for you or he can lose it for you. This is the first season he'll be the full time starter so hopefully he's figured some stuff out and is ready to lead."
CFB,3dtzgg,BrettGilpin,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"We're not going to be hurting at all at running back. Sure Josey and Hansbrough were our main, but we also had Ish Witter who did pretty damn good and then there are other great prospects behind them.  We'll be hurting at D-Line though I think it will still probably be a solid one. Just not one we're used to.  WR, I'll be cautiously optimistic. Just because they are young and we don't know how they'll do doesn't mean they will be bad.  Mauk will be better than last season and has shown that already. The big question though is, will he be much better than last season (which he needs to be)."
CFB,3dtzgg,universal_cynic,6,Sun Jul 19 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see Tennessee giving them some trouble. They could go 10-2, but I would be surprised if that ends up being the case"
CFB,3dtzgg,CalRipkenSucks,5,Sun Jul 19 14:13:16 2015 UTC,Their non-conference schedule is more difficult than half of the SEC West.  The biggest complaint I have about Missouri how they have stacked all of their non-conference games at the beginning of the season.  They didn't play their first SEC until October in 2013.  It's like they have a preseason while teams like Florida and South Carolina have already played two SEC games in the first four games against teams like Alabama and Texas A&M.
CFB,3dtzgg,AuburnSeer,5,Sun Jul 19 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"Who is Mizzou's permanent West opponent? Arkansas, right?"

CFB,3dtzgg,AuburnSeer,8,Sun Jul 19 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"actually, you know what else this thread is reminding me of? That 2013 Mizzou team might be one of the most underrated teams of the last ten years. They shouldn't be hand-waived as ""had an easy schedule"" because they didn't."
CFB,3dtzgg,jschooltiger,7,Sun Jul 19 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"2013 Mizzou had a lot of offensive talent, which is one of the reasons Mauk was able to go 3-1 after Franklin got hurt. 2014 Mizzou didn't have as much offensive talent (and seriously, Mauk is probably statistically Mizzou's worst qb since before Brad Smith), but the defense was able to keep it close until something good would happen."
CFB,3dtzgg,cubsrule1141,16,Sun Jul 19 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"We do this every year. Everyone shits on Mizzou for something or another, and we just win. And like its been mentioned, we don't make our conference schedule. And the OOC is bad because of the move."

CFB,3dtzgg,C-Jammin,4,Sun Jul 19 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"*As a Georgia fan, you should probably take everything I say with a grain of salt.   I expect Mizzou to be 4-0 heading into the SC game.  I don't know what to really expect from SC.  They're strength has been their offense, but they will have a first year starter this season at QB (as will most of the SEC).  Their defense is a work in progress, but it doesn't really have anywhere to go but up.  But again, I have no idea so I'll give Mizzou the edge.  Florida is in trouble on offense yet again.  Their O-line is going to get eaten alive.  Mizzou.  I expect UGA to win (part because they are a better team on paper, part bias).  Vandy is Vandy, Mizzou wins.  Mississippi St. probably has the best QB in the conference, so they have a legit shot.  BYU has a chance in their game but I would still lean Mizzou (though I suppose it doesn't matter, out of conference).  Now it gets interesting.  I'm in the boat that says Tennessee is going to see vast improvement this season.  Maybe not enough to win the East, but enough to put a scare in UGA and Mizzou.  I think Tenneessee eeks out a win.  And I expect Arkansas to win at home in the regular season finale.  The thing with Mizzou is I don't know how to judge their offense.  Maty Mauk sometimes plays like he is the best QB in the SEC.  Other times, he plays like the play call is to commit a turnover.  He is so hot and cold and very inconsistent.  Mizzou also lost their best playmaker on defense so you have to expect them to take a step back.  Looking at other schedules, UGA's is favorable too.  They have 3 tough games.  They have Tennessee in Knoxville, Bama in Athens, and Auburn in Auburn.  I think they'll win at least one of those, strong possibility to win two.  I think both teams have a strong chance of ending up 10-2 (6-2), but I think UGA wins the head-to-head."
CFB,3dtzgg,jayhawx19,6,Sun Jul 19 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"It's an ""easy schedule"" for SEC standards. They were still #10 SOS last season with a similar one, I wouldn't expect them outside the top 20 this season. I hate Missouri as much as anyone but this is just not as weak as most P5 teams."
CFB,3dtzgg,GreenWaveGator,4,Sun Jul 19 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"When did Southeast Missouri, Arkansas State, UConn, and BYU all join the SEC? Who let this happen?"
CFB,3dtzgg,BoxScoreHero,4,Sun Jul 19 16:46:33 2015 UTC,Hi I'm a Missouri fan and I think the schedule is easy but you've also given us way too much credit because Missouri lost a lot from the past two years.
CFB,3dtzgg,nickknx865,7,Sun Jul 19 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"There are a few games other than the two you listed that I could see as ""losable"" games -- these aren't games I'd predict them to lose, but rather, that it's entirely possible that they could lose. I also disagree with the idea that they'll win the east while ""barely breaking a sweat.""   Kentucky always seems to pull an upset or two every season. Last year, they beat South Carolina, and played a very hard fought game with then #1 Mississippi State. While I'm still picking Missouri to win this game, it's not completely out of the question for Kentucky to pull the upset. It should also be noted that last year's game between the two only ended up at 20-10, so it's not like Missouri blew them out. South Carolina only lost by 1 point to Missouri last season, and SCar won the total yards advantage by a count of 330-280 in that game. However, South Carolina is only 79th in the nation with 12 returning starters (although 8 of them are on defense), so this isn't going to be much like the team from last year. Still, I wouldn't characterize this as a gimme win for Missouri. Florida wasn't really close to Missouri in their game last year, so I'm not sure that that's going to change, especially with the regime change in Gainesville. Georgia is one of the losses you predict, so we'll leave that for now. Vanderbilt is still a year or two off from being able to compete (not win) in league play. Mississippi State lost a massive amount of starters from last year's NY6 bowl squad, but I still wouldn't discount them, as they still have Dak Prescott. Not to mention, Mississippi State is basically even with Missouri in terms of recruiting rankings over the last 2-3 years, so I'm not sure this is going to be an easy game for them. Although BYU isn't a conference opponent and doesn't effect how the East race plays out, this isn't a team to take lightly for other reasons. They have experience playing and beating major conference opponents. Tennessee is going to be much improved, and our game was tough fought with Missouri last year, with the game not being decided until late in the 4th quarter. I don't know how this game is going to go, but I think the Vols are probably going to be a tough outing for Missouri this year. Arkansas beat Missouri last year played Missouri close, and I see you have that as a loss for them. I'm not sure how that plays out either, but I know Arkansas is going to be a tough opponent for anyone this year.   tl;dr: this probably isn't the breeze you think it is."

CFB,3dvsco,Drunken_Wanderer,13,Sun Jul 19 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"Birmingham native, spent 2 years at UAB and went to a total of maybe 4 games. People always claimed ""safety concerns,"" but the people that lived around the stadium were awesome, and always opened up their lawns for parking (for a small fee that was considerably less than the actual stadium parking). The problem was convenience. UAB is a major commuter school, and B'ham traffic is notoriously awful. It was tough to drive all the way across the city on the terrible interstate system to get to a game when Auburn or Alabama were likely playing on tv around the same time.   And this was in the early 2000's when Roddy White was tearing it up week after week."
CFB,3dvsco,jomofoyoass,4,Mon Jul 20 00:27:32 2015 UTC,Saturday traffic in Bham ain't much though (except this summer when they've decided to repave I-65 and basically only work on the weekends).

CFB,3dvsco,bobby8375,12,Mon Jul 20 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"The ""big city"" stadium/occasional neutral site field is such a random, yet logical, southern tradition. Inevitable that Arkansas will fade away from their big city stadium (since they're already down to 1 game a year there) just like Miss/MSU left Jackson and AU/UA left Birmingham.   Cool that the neutral site with TAMU is sticking around (thanks to Jerry Jones), along with the UF/UGA Jacksonville game."
CFB,3dvsco,Boyhowdy107,4,Mon Jul 20 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"I kind of like them. The Red River Shootout is always great at the Cotton Bowl and I personally like when Mizzou-Kansas was at Kansas City.

CFB,3dvsco,bobby8375,4,Mon Jul 20 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"Have they made a commitment to keep RR at the Cotton Bowl? Know there has been talk to move it to H/H since both teams have much bigger stadiums and don't have a real difficult time getting people to their campus (same reason why Iron Bowl was moved, etc.).  FSU has a big enough stadium and recruiting is just fine, but still I think it's a good idea for them to try to play a game in a big city, especially ones that rivals (or pseudo-rivals) ""control"", once every couple years, like the scheduled trips to Orlando and Atlanta."
CFB,3dvsco,ghetto_draco,6,Mon Jul 20 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"Have they made a commitment to keep RR at the Cotton Bowl?   They have a contract through 2025. I think the biggest threat to having it at the Cotton Bowl isn't the possibility of doing it on the campuses, but moving it to Jerry World. I'm pretty sure Jerry tried to convince them to move, but the Cotton Bowl convinced them not too. I really don't see it every moving."

CFB,3dvsco,bobby8375,3,Mon Jul 20 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"According to wiki, part of the convincing was Dallas giving the schools more money to play at the Cotton Bowl, money which was no longer going to the ""Cotton Bowl"" postseason game which moved to Jerry world."
CFB,3dvsco,Boyhowdy107,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope they keep it there. Being set in the middle of the Texas State Fair just creates a really cool atmosphere — one you lose if you move it to Jerry World. They've thrown some renovation money at it, in large part due to trying to stay competitive against Jerry World. They still get a little bowl season money as while they lost the Cotton Bowl, they got the Heart of Dallas Bowl there. I'm personally hoping the city of Dallas doesn't get to a point where they just don't see it as worth it to invest future repair/renovation cash there based on the event income they're pulling. That would be the one reason I could see them moving it."

Its not in the middle of academic buildings I guess, but its literally across the street from the main campus. A class I'm taking right now is like a 4 minute walk from the stadium.   From Greek Row (at the north of campus on that map, not highlighted or anything) and the student off-campus housing where they pre-game it's maybe a 12-15 minute drunken walk downhill. Can't compare it to many other schools since I've only been to a few  but I'd wager its a shorter trek than most on average.   EDIT: Checked the database of campus-stadium distances and saw where you got the 4 mile stat. Was shocked to see UW so high on the distance list given how its literally across the street from campus, and most definitely closer than Autzen is to UO campus (one of the few other stadiums I've been to, don't entirely mean to pick on you guys). Wonder how inaccurate the numbers are for other schools on the list..  Double Edit: The 4 mile stat is referring to CenturyLink (which is downtown), not Husky Stadium, since it was done in 2012 when Husky Stadium was getting rebuilt."

If you're in Greek Row or off-campus housing where people pre-game its about a 15 minute walk down through campus to the water.

It's very accessible with free buses and the subway going straight from campus to the stadium. The thing that suffers more than anything is the atmosphere.

I wouldn't be surprised if Rutgers had the second-largest college-football fan base in Philadelphia after Penn State, and ahead of Temple. (Temple probably has more alumni, thus my specifying ""fan base"".)  Of course, as /u/dominatethestate said, Philly is (like NYC and Boston, and unlike Birmingham, Atlanta, or Miami) first and foremost an NFL town footballwise."

It doesn't matter which one you go to, you'll be waiting in line for about 15 minutes on a regular game day (like Tulsa or San Jose) just to get to the parking fields. The drive to those lines from anywhere in town probably also averages 15 minutes (~30 minutes all the way from I-25 to Hughes). Then, once you've paid for parking, you'll spend another 5 minutes getting to your spot because the college kids they have directing traffic are too busy trying to chase pussy or are texting their friends about how hard they're working or how over it they are.  When you are finally able to get out of your car it looks like a much larger version of every high school party out in the boonies you've ever been to, but way more fun. THIS  Rather than a big game day campus-y ""cut from the same cloth"" thing, it feels more like a outdoor music festival parking/camping area with everyone there to see the same band.  If you are walking or biking there you'd want to bring a coat even on a sunny day because Colorado. The temperature can also drop 30 degrees on you at an evening game. That t-shirt and shorts walk back to the dorms in 30-40 degree weather is bullshit.  Getting back out of there can quickly turn into a cluster fuck and it can easily take as much time getting back out as it did getting in.

CFB,3dvsco,TDenverFan,2,Mon Jul 20 05:52:19 2015 UTC,"There's a dedicated soccer field on campus. As far as why it doesn't get used for football as well, my best guess is that football attendance dwarfs soccer attendance.  Our soccer stadium only seats a few hundred (mostly on grass seats), and we draw about 2,000 fans per home football game.  Last I heard, our lacrosse teams still play their matches on the fields along the west side of campus, adjacent to railroad tracks.  I suppose that it might be possible to construct an on campus stadium, but the cost and headache associated with constructing a stadium in a cramped spot on a hill on our former golf course, when we don't really have much/any room to expand parking, isn't worth the benefit of having games on campus."

CFB,3dvsco,voltron818,2,Mon Jul 20 05:02:11 2015 UTC,"We split our games on and off campus.  Firstly some geography. Our campus is at least 2.0h from Boston and a solid 1.5h to the 495 border which is the highway surrounding Boston about 35 miles on every side. Inside 495 is the largest portion of population in the state by far.  The Gillette stadium is 2.0-2.5h from campus with traffic, but only 30-60 minutes from most parts of eastern MA. So people towards Boston can access Gillette easier. Students however have to board a bus 3.5h before the game and ride the 2.5h drive there and back basically making it an entire day commitment. Only hardcore student fans choose to do that.  On campus, the stadium is literally 100 yards from the largest residential area on campus. Students can wander from the dorm to the stadium without any real planning. This means that people that don't really care show up to tailgate or go into the game for the first quarter and a half before leaving. Also getting to the stadium is harder for non-students as Amherst is not a big town, with no real highway between I-91 and Amherst.  In the end it's sort of a push, but I favor the on campus games. I think engaging students is more important at this point so prefer games on campus. With that being said our on campus stadium is only 17k, so I can see why when we play Mississippi State at home they choose Gillette which is 65K+. (Yes Mississippi State agreed to play us at home)"

Fwiw I'm not ""anti-UAB"" at all, I'm just against a massive waste of money that could really do wonders for the school in other places."
CFB,3dzloi,Ben_Afflock,3,Mon Jul 20 21:27:00 2015 UTC,It's not just too early it's completely pointless to say that.  The donations aren't due until the end of the year.  it doesn't matter what amount of donations has trickled in at this point.  The donations are contractually obligated to be paid by the end of the year.  They will be paid off or you will see people being taken to court.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,0,Mon Jul 20 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"Its not pointless to question the numbers. Specifically these ""pledges"" don't sound so watertight or even legally binding.  We have a few months until this circus gets fully back up and barking."
CFB,3dzloi,Ben_Afflock,0,Mon Jul 20 21:45:30 2015 UTC,What makes you say that they aren't legally binding?  Have you personally seen the forms that were signed for these pledges?
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:29 2015 UTC,I'm saying that there isn't any evidence I've found that these pledges were legally binding.

In any case this will resolve itself and we can discuss the facts once the final status of these pledges is determined.
CFB,3dzloi,Ben_Afflock,0,Mon Jul 20 23:13:01 2015 UTC,At least we have a new way to find asshole Alabama fans I guess.
CFB,3dzloi,Euphanistic,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:56:42 2015 UTC,It's so strange what is happening with Bama fans and uab.  For the most part Ohio state fans say that they wish most of the other Ohio schools to do well as none of them really compete with osu.  With Bama you see a whole different view point and I generally see a lot of ill will towards uab which just seems silly.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,10,Mon Jul 20 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, it is more about this subreddit blaming Alabama football for getting rid of UAB football and it got tiresome.  Most people don't care about UAB football until the rumors of going belly-up came out and all of a sudden it was another reason to say Alabama is evil, blah, blah."
CFB,3dzloi,MisterFalcon7,0,Mon Jul 20 22:50:53 2015 UTC,Idk about that.  I've seen a ton of Alabama flairs defending the decision to end uabs program and saying that it was a waste of money to fund it and so forth. Even to this day you still see Bama flairs saying that the program still shouldn't come back.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,5,Mon Jul 20 22:52:41 2015 UTC,Because we hate UAB so much.
CFB,3dzloi,MisterFalcon7,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:54:13 2015 UTC,It seriously seems like it.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,5,Mon Jul 20 22:55:38 2015 UTC,We don't want to compete against them.  Too much work.
CFB,3dzloi,MisterFalcon7,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"Probably because even when they evaluated it   Before they made the D1 leap, there were concerns over its possibility to thrive. Add in the massive lack of success and it's not really surprising people view it as a waste. There hasn't been an increase in enrollment, it's losing money, and it looks like it's going nowhere. If it looks, sounds and seems like a waste it probably is one.  The main argument for UAB was that it was a third six win season in 15ish years and they were on the up and up. Somehow it also means they're stealing recruits from us, stealing fans and so on. None of the arguments made sense at all nor really supported much.  Other than that, we had a shit ton of UAB fans posting stuff and starting a brigade against ""UAT"" because apparently everyone on the board, of like 10 people who made the decision, resides on this subreddit and schemed against UAB. It gets annoying when you're basically crucified and attacked for no fucking reason but no one decides to actually man up and speak against it."
CFB,3dzloi,UhOhOreo2012,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:38 2015 UTC,The Alabama system hasn't given them a chance to succeed though.  They had donations lined up to build an on-campus stadium and the board told them to F off basically.  They are underfunded and play in the corpse of what was a good stadium 50 years ago.  Give them the actual resources to succeed and you might be surprised by the results.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"The system pushed them to division one when there was already a study suggesting they should cut the program. They've been supported a lot over the years, just not much recently in light of how the program developed. They didn't have attendance figures for a new stadium so that was passed. They had donations lined up but there wasn't any real incentive to push it through and pay for the other costs if there were no signs it would be nothing other than a profitless sunk cost.  People are arguing the program will flourish in G5, but in reality it likely won't based on history. There's a lot more that needs to be changed if they want to be successful."
CFB,3dzloi,UhOhOreo2012,0,Mon Jul 20 23:24:08 2015 UTC,Again the attendance figures can easily come down to playing at Legion Field.  Would you seriously want to go to Legion Field to watch your team play now?  I'm pretty sure it is quite literally falling apart and that people aren't physically allowed in certain parts of the stadium anymore.  I've never personally been there but stories I've heard from people who have been there is that the surrounding area is basically the hood and there's a good chance your car will get broken into.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"You can think the football program was a financial disaster while supporting the university as a whole.   In other words, the calls to keep the program are based on emotion and wild hope with other people's money while the calls to end the program cite the actual circumstances of the program and the reality it was in dire straights."
CFB,3dzloi,Ben_Afflock,0,Mon Jul 20 23:20:20 2015 UTC,And it was in dire straights because of a complete lack of funding.  You can't expect a program to succeed while forcing them to play in a stadium that should have been torn down 20 years ago which is located in a shit part of town.  Then when UAB lines up donations to build a privately funded on-campus stadium the board says no and that's the end of that.  They haven't been given a chance to succeed at all.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:58 2015 UTC,Werent given a chance? The vast majority of their bills have been paid for out of state funds for the last 15 years and somehow they weren't given a chance?  please reconsider your opinion in light of the fact that the program was only alive with massive subsidies from state money. in no universe did a self sufficient UAB football get a stadium turned down. UAB football can have that stadium but it has to earn it.
CFB,3dzloi,Ben_Afflock,0,Mon Jul 20 23:31:55 2015 UTC,Do you know how many self-sufficient football programs actually exist in the FBS?  Only 58% are self-sufficient.  A ton are funded in the ways in which you state is the reason to cancel UAB which is just silly.  Not only that you are complaining about UAB not being self sufficient while playing at freaking Legion Field which is probably going to collapse on itself in the next 5 years.  UAB hasn't been given a chance no matter what ridiculous excuse you come up with.
CFB,3dzloi,GhostdadUC,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"The whole thing just makes me sad. I'm really sad that UAB gets its dirty laundry aired all over the sports media including its severe issues in support and funding.  I'd just ask you to not think of the program as a victim. It was supported by the state and the Board for over fifteen years without the necessary fan support and when it finally became too much we won't let it rest.  Plenty of people just assume the money is there and it really isn't or the program wouldn't have been cancelled by the University president. Putting our emotion aside, how many millions of state dollars are you willing to spend on the program? Because I'm sure UAB football over its life has outspent that.  People won't let it die, not because its the right thing to do, but because they have their own emotional needs tied up with the program and they just can't let it go. Lets be real for a moment, this program was in trouble for a long time and the issues still haven't been solved. Please stop assuming the people involved in ending the program are mustache twirling villains, because the reality is that they just saw the program for what it really is."

CFB,3dujn8,Crymaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"You can't judge our rival based on history.  We've only been D1A for 16 years. Also, you have to judge the rivalry at the time it's live.  I get that we only played Rutgers a few times, which is why I certainly wouldn't consider them a rival now.  However, when we played regularly we considered them rivals, mostly because we have enough students from the NYC/LI area to create a general hatred of New Jersey, but also because they were one of the few teams we could actually beat when we made the jump from D1AA.   Temple was our rival in the late 2000s because they were put in a similar position as us in the MAC, no historical rivaly and geographically separated from the rest of the conference.  And we most certainly do have history, as the greatest play in UB football history came against Temple in what we certainly considered a rivalry game. Video.  For what it's worth, EA also considered Temple our rival before the videogame franchise stopped.  As for Ohio, the rivalry comes more from basketball than football.  The Bobcats ruined our first two best chances to go the the NCAA tournament. First in 2005.  Then again in 2012.  I understand that none of our rivalries could even dream to measure up to the great (or even average) rivalries in college sports, but that doesn't mean we've never had rivals.  TL;DR: We do have rivals, even if we don't have the history that older/larger programs have.  Ours are just smaller scale.  Also, fuck Ohio."

CFB,3dujn8,FirstOne617,6,Sun Jul 19 17:01:33 2015 UTC,I think the moral of this particular story is that we need to find some way to get purple and gold into more uniforms.  Oregon and Washington State are both rocking that look.  Actually can we just force UW and WSU to swap colors?
CFB,3dujn8,Maisbikkja,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:57 2015 UTC,we need to find some way to get purple and gold into more uniforms   I'm good with this.

CFB,3dujn8,trojanlaker,2,Sun Jul 19 21:06:57 2015 UTC,Or how nice Berkeley's colors are that you guys ripped off faster than a cheap circumcision
CFB,3dujn8,versusChou,3,Mon Jul 20 02:03:15 2015 UTC,"Look at Berkeley's colors. Now look at ours. Completely different shade of blue. We did ""steal"" Cal's colors and traditions, but only because we were part of the same school originally. It's not like we're unrelated. And then considering how well we've done for ourselves, we altered the blue and the Bruin into our own thing. And our blue simply looks better."

I think at this point they are the least evil in comparison with Stanford and USC.  A certain older drum major asked me once when I told him we played together with UCLA in 2012 if we still remembered about Sons of Westwood.  Responding with ""If you had to choose another California's band to get along with, who would you choose?""  he nodded and smiled ""I suppose so.""  Also the fact we've been splitting with them in basketball and football instead of losing for 18 straight years in both (which was the '70s and '80s) to them tends to help with the friendly opinion of them."

FSU, UGA, UT, and even Auburn, are much more important and emotional rivalries than Miami.

Beyond FSU basically having two OOC rivalry games for a decade in starting in 1992 there are a few teams currently that are in a similar situation. Iowa State and USC are basically in the same situation with both having nine conference games an an OOC rivalry series so you have ten games every year.   It would be totally possible for UF to do a series with UM and I'd love to see it, it just isn't necessary and you're probably losing money regardless. A 2/3 full stadium for a game against a terrible OOC every year is going to be better for the bottom line than a packed stadium every other year against an in state rival. It just doesn't make sense to give up the money from the WLOCP and a guaranteed home game in return for only one home game. I'd love to see UF and UM play every year, but it's not going to happen outside of a series every now and then."

CFB,3dvgp2,StoneEater,9,Sun Jul 19 23:06:36 2015 UTC,The UGA game is in Jax because it's been there for 70ish years and Jax pays out a very good amount for it.  We lose money playing playing Miami because we lose a home game.  I don't remember all the financials off the top of my head.
CFB,3dvgp2,n9ucs,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:16 2015 UTC,I'm unfamiliar with the financials. What is the reason that playing Georgia in Jax is better than altwrnating?
CFB,3dvgp2,cycling_and_cfb,2,Mon Jul 20 03:20:27 2015 UTC,"The city of Jacksonville pays UGA and UF more money than we could generate with ticket sales in our own stadiums even though our stadiums have more capacity, they do this so that hotels and bars, and restaurants can make a bunch more money. TL;DR home games in Athens are worth 2.8 million.  Jax pays UGA 1.6million every year."

CFB,3dvgp2,Lrlax12,2,Mon Jul 20 11:39:43 2015 UTC,"Also, everyone is right, we do need to get out of Florida and the south more often. I'd love to see us go play some upper-middle tier Big10/12 teams. Those would be great home and homes."
CFB,3dvgp2,Lrlax12,2,Mon Jul 20 11:41:30 2015 UTC,Florida gains nothing from playing Miami. We already kept the better in-state rivalry in FSU. I'd much rather see us play a home-and-home with OOC powers like the one we have scheduled with Michigan than have to waste a game in Miami Gardens.
CFB,3dvgp2,lookiebutnotalkie,3,Mon Jul 20 15:04:32 2015 UTC,No. Just let the game go to Atlanta once every five years. No need for UGA and UF to be a home and home.

CFB,3dvgp2,anshr01,3,Sun Jul 19 22:37:18 2015 UTC,we get shit on for not playing out of the state   But that's in addition to not playing Miami. If y'all continued playing Miami annually y'all wouldn't really get shit for not playing out of state because y'all would already be playing the major teams in-state
CFB,3dvgp2,Gryfer,2,Mon Jul 20 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Instead, OOC turns into FAU, UAB, and Furman; Bowling Green, ULL, and Jacksonville State; or Idaho, Eastern Michigan, and Eastern Kentucky."
CFB,3dvgp2,lookiebutnotalkie,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:30 2015 UTC,And? It's not like teams like most major FBS teams are scheduling multiple top-25 opponents for home-and-homes on a yearly basis. FSU has had as weak a non-rivalry OOC slate as Florida many of the past few years despite knowing they have a much weaker conference schedule already (FOr example Wake Forest and Syracuse are both among the worst 25 teams in the FBS regardless of conference). I know you can't predict how good teams will be a couple years down the road but it's a safe assumption the ACC as a whole will include one or two teams in the bottom third of the FBS so you should schedule accordingly.   Having a home game to the WLOCP (which I'm fine with) plus FSU as a permanent OOC opponent and having a perennial top-15 team as the permanent SEC West opponent means UF doesn't need to schedule more great OOC opponents every year.
CFB,3dvgp2,Gryfer,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"For example, Wake Forest and Syracuse   On the flipside, you get Vanderbilt and Kentucky.   so you should schedule accordingly   We do schedule accordingly. While every year isn't featuring a headliner (like this year or 2012), over the same five year period I referred to Florida's OOC schedule, we played a home-and-home with Oklahoma, a neutral site game with Oklahoma State (in the same season we had ND as a ninth ""conference"" game), and BYU. And look at our next two seasons? We open with Ole Miss and Alabama. Anybody who thinks we wouldn't make it to the CFP by beating three powderpuffs + ACC + UF is delusional. Nonetheless, we're scheduling more great OOC opponents like Florida won't.  Long story short and to address this comment:   means UF doesn't need to schedule more great OOC opponents every year   It's not that there's anything wrong with your schedule. If you want to make it to the CFP, win your schedule and you'll be there. On the other hand, people aren't the CFP committee and want to see some excitement from time to time. With Florida, it really boils down to ""conference games + FSU.""  And that's where my comment came in. It's not just bashing Florida's scheduling with no context. It's that people want to see Florida either [1] occasionally playing a decent OOC non-rivalry game or [2] playing Miami annually like FSU did when Miami was still a non-con game.  EDIT: Awesome -- downvotes because you disagree."

I think the real solution is to find a way to make a 6 home game season work in terms of revenue. This is, of course, how UGA does it: if we schedule a home-and-home with an OOC team it means we only have 6 home games in the season we play the OOC team away. And it happens often: e.g. Clemson 2013, Colorado 2010, Oklahoma State 2009, Arizona State 2008, Clemson 2003, etc"

Why do we need to change a great tradition to play another in-state team that we really don't need to play? Those that complain have never been to Florida-Georgia game more recently. The atmosphere is great, stadium is in great conditions, and the scoreboard screens are worth the money to see alone. Every year 40,000 UGA and 40,000 UF fans (give or take a few thousand) split right down the center show up. The rivalry wouldn't be the same if we did home and home or move it to ATL every other year. Is Miami so important to play every year since we already play FSU? On another note since we aren't playing them every year, I don't mind getting matched up with Miami in a bowl or playoff game every once in a while."

CFB,3dtzsy,nickknx865,3,Sun Jul 19 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"Wesley was in a bad situation because most of the leagues close to them have 10 teams, leaving only 1 OOC game for those teams.

This is why Wesley had to take anyone they could get from about Week 5 on, from UNC-Charlotte (who they beat 2 years ago) to College of Faith and everything in between.  This year they join the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) which expanded to 10 teams by adding Wesley (IND), Southern VA (NAIA to D3 IND), Christopher Newport (USA South), Frostburg State (Empire 8) and Salisbury (Empire 8).

Incidentally, 1921 was the year we first were awarded a Helms Championship in basketball and was around the time we went from being pretty good in basketball to a national powerhouse."
CFB,3duqdz,CodyWilson7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:53 2015 UTC,So a string of bad football coaches alongside a very good basketball coach. And the program just naturally went towards basketball?

Isn't that where any program would've ended up?  Although, it's worth noting that we were undefeated against UT before you guys came to the Big XII. Granted it was like three games, but still."

CFB,3dtyqh,EnigmaticHats,28,Sun Jul 19 13:08:52 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of question marks around this team, which makes this list somewhat hard when you get past the first 5 or so. I'll take a shot at it though!   Vernon Hargreaves III (CB, JR): This kid's a beast. Was a first team all-american last year and is expected to go top 10 in the draft this year. While he definitely possesses good physical skills, he's especially well known for how smart he is about the game. He doesn't let big plays happen. Jonathan Bullard (DL, SR): We've moved him around to different parts of the line depending on where we've been weak the last few years, and he's succeeded wherever he's been. He's expected to be drafred, I'd guess in the first 4 rounds or so. Demarcus Robinson (WR, JR): This kid is a beast of a talent on a team that's had no offense the last few years. He occasionally has trouble catching the ball, which is an obvious downside, but on a team that was close to last in the SEC in passing yardage, he had the 5th most reception yards and 7th most touchdowns of receivers. Antonio Morrison (LB, SR): This kid has had a weird career at UF. He had a great freshman season, where he was well known for getting a great sac in the FSU game. Then he had a lackluster sophmore season that many attribute to gaining too much weight (he also got arrested for punching a bouncer and barking at a police dog). Last year he lived up to the hype, and proceeded to get a major knee injury in our bowl game. He should be back after about 4 games this year. He's likely also top 4 round talent Jake McGee (TE, RSR): He was a transfer from Virginia we got last year (who was a beast there), who proceeded to break his leg when one of our linemen fell on him against eastern michigan...He should be our second receiving threat this year, and should help open up our offense. He is much better at catching than blocking, though he has the requisite size. He was rated for rds 4-6 when at Virginia 2 years ago."
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,20,Sun Jul 19 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"6. Alex Mccalister (DE, RJR): When this kid was brought in, he was 6'6"" and hardly 200 pounds. He has gained a lot of weight the last few years to get up to an SEC playing weight, and he was probably our best pure rusher last year (better than fowler at rushing, not better than fowler). He'll easily have the most sacs on our team next year, it'll be interesting to see what he shows past that.  ~This is where it really starts to get hard~  7. Brian Poole (NB, SR): This kid has had some struggles playing outside at cornerback, but he's never failed to make plays playing inside at nickle. I truly think his skill is underrated among UF fans. I don't have any wager to where he'll be drafted with his specific skillset.  8. Jalen Tabor (CB, SO): He was a 5 star recruit, and definitely played up to his billing last year, despite some communication struggles in early games last year. He'll in all likelyhood (since we lost JC Jackson) be starting opposite of VHIII, though Quincy Wilson is close.  9. Brandon Powell (WR, SO): This kid was brought in as a scatback, though he impressed with his hands and route-running last year and was essentially switched to slot reciever. He also will see work in the return game. He's most likely to be the second receiver to emerge. He's also somewhat of a leader for the team (he went to SEC media days for us)  10. Taven Bryan (DT, RFR): So this kid hasn't played yet, but he's received endless praise from two staffs now, so I'm pretty high on him making a big impact this year. He redshirted last year due to illness in Summer Camp and incredible depth in our DL. Oft referred to as our Wildman.  Just Missed the List:  Alex Anzalone, Jarrad Davis, Will Grier, Joey Ivie, Kelvin Taylor, Keanu Neal, David Sharpe, Quincy Wilson"
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,8,Sun Jul 19 14:38:21 2015 UTC,Good list! My only critique is that I think Keanu Neal should be in the 5th or 6th spot and then everyone else gets moved down a spot.
CFB,3dtyqh,fooke33,3,Sun Jul 19 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do with Neal on this list. He definitely has a major chance to have a breakout year and he's a hell of an athlete. Anzalone's sorta in the same category as him in my mind as for as potential for this year."
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,6,Sun Jul 19 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"Keanu is probably the second or third best player on the team after Vernon and Bullard. D-Rob is insanely talented - and still very raw. His route running is hilariously inconsistent. If it improves, he's easily worthy of a top 3 spot. Quincy Wilson is a better corner than Tabor; don't be surprised if he ends up being the guy everyone is freaking out about in October (I don't know a ton about Collins' defense but if it's similar to his MSST stuff Quincy will have 75 tackles, a couple sacks, and like 3-4 picks by the end of the year.)  Taven and McCalister are interesting studies because they're both very natural fits for Muschamp's defense, but it will be curious how they're used moving forward. If Sharpe plays at RT, he'll be a good player. If he plays at Guard, he's an elite player."
CFB,3dtyqh,symmes,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"Hey just curious, how is your team going to be this year? What do you think your record could be? Florida is easily my favorite SEC team so I'm rooting for you guys"
CFB,3dtyqh,domspart,4,Sun Jul 19 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how our offense ends up coming together, which hinges on a lot of question marks.  While we should have better receivers and receiving TE's than last year, that's one question mark. Additionally we're in the middle of a QB competition, between Treon Harris (who started last year) and Will Grier (who is expected to get the nod this time); QB play must improve. The biggest problem for the offense and the team in general comes from the OL, where we had 4 drafted last year and return the least amount of snaps of any P5 team. McElwain has done a few things to patch up our OL, but it's not expected to be very good.  Our defense on the other hand, should continue to be elite. We have an argument to having the best secondary in the nation, and probably have a top 5 DL in the SEC. The biggest question mark here in my mind is really how having a new DC changes things.  I think we're definitely a bowl team barring some major breakdowns, but most realistically I don't see more than 7-8 wins unless our OL and offense in general are much better than expected"
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,7,Sun Jul 19 18:35:30 2015 UTC,I particularly like knowing about players like McGee who essentially missed last season.  Those kind of guys can really help a team surprise people.
CFB,3dtyqh,Bro7695,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:37 2015 UTC,I'm terrified for ECU facing that Hargreaves led defense. Should be fun to watch regardless
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much better than the usual creampuff home games I'm used to, it's weird though with us just having played in our bowl game. The way I look at your team, I imagine your team in general, and especially your offense, will take a step back from last year; do you agree?"
CFB,3dtyqh,Witch_Docter77,28,Sun Jul 19 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"1) Myles Garrett. DE Soph: A monster, O-line wrecker, Destroyer of Worlds, all of these are acceptable ways to describe our Lord and Savior Myles Garrett. Myles can wreck havoc at any moment and, hopefully, with a stronger supporting cast around him, he can ascend to greater heights. The perfect speed, size, and motor to play DE, Myles Garrett makes QBs and O-line piss their beds at night.   2) Kyle Allen QB Soph: This is under the assumption that Kyle continues his impressive development from his Freshman year and beats out top commit, Kyler Murray. Kyle got the state half way through the season and improved much throughout the part of the season he played. Showing poise in the pocket, a strong arm, and good decision making, Kyle is the prototypical QB prospect for the NFL.   3) Speedy Noil WR/KR Soph: Speedy was used as our Jack of All Trades last year, doing kick returns, punt returns, Wide Receiver, and occasionally a handoff on a reverse. Wide Reciever was the weakest of the positions he played (mostly b/c he played QB in high school), but whenever he gets the ball in his hands he's a threat to score. He shows such great awareness on returns to follow his blocks and then hit the hole blazing.   4) Germain Ifedi OT Jr: I don't know how much I can saw about an A&M OT, other than congratulations on getting picked in the first round (O-line U)   5) Armani Watts SS Soph: A rnavy and hard hitting safety, Armani Watts is there when our corners brake coverage(which happens a lot) so he gets his tackling practice in. Not scared of contact, the slightly undersized Armani is scared of no man, no RB, or their ilk.   6) Devante Harris CB Sr: I put Devante on this list more b/c of his importance to the team then his actual skill. He gets burned... A lot. It's scary seeing him line up in man coverage, and now this guy is our #1 Corner... Someone hold me...   7) Tra Carson RB Sr: Tra is a wrecking ball carrying the ball. He will knock you over, take your lunch money, pick you back up again, and then take your lunch money again. Tra can get us the tough yards between the tackles. He hopes to build off of an impressive Liberty Bowl performance.   8) Josh Reynolds WR Jr: Last year Josh Reynolds came from a JUCO, earned a starting WR spot in a crowded position, Nad then proceeded to break(or tie, I don't remember) the school record for TD catches. Josh is a threat to score no matter where he is on the field (as long as he can catch the ball)   9) Otaro Alako LB Soph: One of the Talented but oft-injured LBs on our team, Otaro heads our thinnest position on the team. The fate our LBs and our Defense may very well depend on the health of Otaro  10) Daeshon Hall DE Sr: The ugly duckling, most people tend to forget about Daeshon b/c of the massive shadow that Myles puts out. Daeshon had a quietly good season last year and if he improves, and our freshmen put in work, we could very well see Thunder and Lightning at the two end positions this year.   This was done on my phone so misspellings and mistakes are probable. I also kept out freshmen b/c we don't know how they'll pan out just yet."
CFB,3dtyqh,Colonel_Janus,11,Sun Jul 19 14:54:07 2015 UTC,"Daeshon should be higher, as should Reynolds. Devante should be at the very bottom of this list if anything lol  Chavis was absolutely raving about both Myles AND Daeshon coming out of the spring, saying our DEs are going to be two of the best not only in the conference but in the country. I know it's premature to say that but it gets me soooo hard"
CFB,3dtyqh,djs0cc3r,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:12 2015 UTC,ooooh boy
CFB,3dtyqh,Witch_Docter77,3,Sun Jul 19 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just put him in because of the importance of his position, not really much his skill. Although I really really hope he proves everyone wrong"
CFB,3dtyqh,FarwellRob,3,Sun Jul 19 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"Good list. It should be noted that RSJ and Noil were former HS QBs that should get much better this year, now that they are actually learning the WR position full time.   Other notables are AJ Hilliard. Played great against USC before being knocked out for a year. He should shore up a lot.   White at RB runs angry. All the time.   But I agree with leaving off the freshmen coming in, until they hit the field. Even if some of them are apparently already running with the first team. Which makes me very happy."
CFB,3dtyqh,Witch_Docter77,3,Sun Jul 19 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"Christian Kirk is exciting me the most, getting the starting nod at WR and PR after only spring practice"
CFB,3dtyqh,FarwellRob,3,Sun Jul 19 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly what caught my eye.  Knocking Noil out of PR?  Um, wow.  Passing up a whole lot of upperclassmen and highly rated receivers to take the starting spot at our most packed position?  Um, wow wow.  He is really making a name for himself and he hasn't even been in a game yet.  That's pretty dang impressive."
CFB,3dtyqh,Working_onit,3,Sun Jul 19 18:21:58 2015 UTC,I would put Alonzo Williams and Justin Evans on the list in addition to what other posters have said.
CFB,3dtyqh,Witch_Docter77,3,Sun Jul 19 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"I had Justin Evans on the list initially instead of Daeshon Hall. I probably should have replaced Devante with Justin but I already had his little blurb written up, so I just went with it."
CFB,3dtyqh,StLHokie,23,Sun Jul 19 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"For Virginia Tech   Kendall Fuller JR CB - Arguably the best cornerback in the nation. Absolutely unreal in Man coverage. Plays different than his older brother Kyle, in that he is ideal for a boundary or Nickel corner as he can cover guys anywhere they run on the field.  Dadi Nicholas SR DE- An athletic freak, albeit small, at DE. He plays at about 230 but is in the 4.5 range in terms of speed and has very good acceleration off the line. Also has a great motor, however at some points he is suseptible to getting caught too far up field. Will be critical that he maintains his gap against OSU's QBs. Luther Maddy SR DT - A guy that had a season ending injury about 1/3 of the way through the season. Another guy that is maybe a bit undersized for his position, however makes up for it in speed off the line. Very good at getting up the field and disrupting interior blocking of the opposing teams offensive line. In VT's system, DT's usually don't get much in terms of tackles or sack numbers as they are more in charge of maintaining interior gaps, but Maddy is good enough to both control his gaps and get up the field.  Bucky Hodges SO TE - A guy that converted to TE before the start of last season, he has already garnered national attention as being a top tight end in the country and he'd only a Sophomore. He's a 6'6"" guy with 4.6 speed and is very much a downfield receiving threat. He's great at adjusting to the ball, and presents tremendous matchup problems. If he gets better in the blocking department, he has the potential to be the best Tight End to come out of VT in quite some time.  Ken Ekanem JR DE - Playing opposite of Dadi, Ken is more typical of a DE in terms of his size and is also very good at getting up the field. His speed isn't as great as Dadi Nicholas, but he makes up for it in strength. A very good player against the run.  Wyatt Teller JR Tackle - A very good, and young, offensive linemen. Very strong upper body and can generate great push using only his arms. Combining that with improved footwork and Wyatt could very well become the top lineman in the ACC, and he has the potential for more.  Corey Marshall SR DT - Another smaller guy on the inside, and he's gone through a lot to play at VT (considered transferring early in his career). But like Maddy, another guy that can fill a gap while getting up the field. Brandon Facyson SO CB - This ranking is more dependent upon how he recovers from the injury that caused him to redshirt last season. As a true freshman corner, he came in and won a starting role almost out of nowhere, and ended up a freshman All-American (over Kendall Fuller) He's very tall and lanky and isn't great in coverage, however he is great at closing in on a receiver once the ball is in the air. He had 5 interceptions his freshman year, including a highlight real one against Georgia Tech seen here. Brandon has the potential to be in the top 3 on this list if he returns to the form he was in his freshman year.  Isaiah Ford SO WR - He came in and won a starting position at WR last year and showed potential to be a speedster and the deep threat the VT had been missing. Still needs to work on his route running a bit, but has all the tools to become an All - Conference WR and he's only a true Sophomore. Led the team last year in receptions and touchdowns as well. Chuck Clark JR CB - Chuck established himself as a very good corner after Facyson was forced to redshirt. He got significant time last year at Nickel and Field corner depending on matchups. This year, he will likely be starting at Free Safety since we lost our free safety Detrick Bonner last year to graduation.   Honestly, there are a lot of players that could fit into the 10 spot. WR Cam Phillips, QB Micheal Brewer, Rover Donavan Riley, and MLB Andrew Motupuaka could all be placed there."
CFB,3dtyqh,_AreWeHavingFunYet_,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"Good write-up. I agree with pretty much everything, especially about Facyson having the potential to be a top 3 player on our team."
CFB,3dtyqh,vtfan08,3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"I second /u/_AreWeHavingFunYet_ - I think Facyson should be higher.  I'd also drop Ekanema couple spots; great player, still has much to learn.  Finally I think I'd put AJ Hughes on this list at 10."
CFB,3dtyqh,mjacksongt,2,Sun Jul 19 17:51:22 2015 UTC,I am so looking forward to Fuller being gone....He's phenomenal.
CFB,3dtyqh,swtwenty,35,Sun Jul 19 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Michigan State Spartans  1. Jack Conklin, JR LT: One of the best tackles in the nation. He's only given up somewhere around 3 or 4 sacks in his career, and had very strong showings last year against Joey Bosa and Shawn Oakman. Currently projected as a 1st round pick.  2. Shilique Calhoun, SR DE: Our star pass rusher, Calhoun had 12.5 TFL and 8 sacks last year. Pass rushing is clearly his strong suit, but his run stopping should improve this year as the DL improves around him. Turned down a possible 1st round grade to return to MSU for his senior season. Projected late 1st round pick.  3. Connor Cook, SR QB: 24-3 as a starter, with only 1 B1G loss, Cook is on his way to being one of the top QBs to ever play at MSU. There are a few question marks, such as his decision making and the loss of two top WRs. But Cook has another year in a familiar system, dangerous weapons in TE Josiah Price and WRs Macgarrett Kings, RJ Shelton and Aaron Burbridge, plus a strong OL up front. Projected 1st round pick.  4. Jack Allen, SR OC: The leader and anchor of the line, Allen is a powerful blocker with a nasty streak. He was a USA Today All-American last year, and is a strong contender for the Rimington this year.  5. Lawrence Thomas, SR DL: A huge athletic player, Thomas played several positions before settling in on the DL in 2014. He came into his own and played very well at both DT and occasionally DE. He's a powerful bull-rusher and lane-stuffer, a good complement to Calhoun's quick edge game.  6. Josiah Price, JR TE: One of Cook's favorite targets, Price always seems to come up with a TD in big games (He's scored against Oregon, Baylor and OSU twice). A big body with soft hands, he should see his stats continue to improve in 2015.  7. Ed Davis, SR OLB: An athletic blitzing linebacker in the mold of former Spartan Denicos Allen. Davis had 12 TFL and 7 sacks in 2014, and should be able to build on that with an improved DL in front of him.  8. Montae Nicholson, SO FS: One of the few players to see the meaningful snaps as a FR under Dantonio, Nicholson looks to already be the most talented member of MSU's secondary this year. Fast and athletic, he shows good potential in both coverage and run stopping. There have also been rumors of him seeing time as a WR.  9. Macgarrett Kings Jr., SR WR: Really any of MSU's returning WRs could go here, but Kings returns the most yards, so I went with him. He's a fast and versatile receiver, performing well in the slot/screen/sweep game as well as being able to go downfield and make a play. He isn't a big body wideout, but he can pick up extra yards with his elusiveness.  10. Madre London, FR RB: London is obviously unproven, but supposedly was dominant as a practice squad player last year. A good combination of speed and size, London has the benefit of running behind what looks to be the best OL in Dantonio's tenure. Definitely a B1G Freshman of the Year candidate."
CFB,3dtyqh,swtwenty,12,Sun Jul 19 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"Excellent write-up, IMO.  My rankings and comments would be very similar, though I believe Kings is clearly the most proven WR on the team, and I'm frankly a little leery about the rest."
CFB,3dtyqh,IAMA_llAMA_AMA,5,Sun Jul 19 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting, that's for sure. Shelton (if you can even consider him really a WR) is consistent, but we need freshman Burbridge to return. He and Bell were the only bright spots in that god awful 2012 offense. Arnett has also gotten good reviews out of camp, but we've heard that a few times before..."
CFB,3dtyqh,vanker,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that 2012 season is what comes to mind.  Even pre-Dantonio, no-name guys would pop up across the roster, and WR in particular was never a worry.  Then I assumed somebody would step up at WR in 2012.  Boy, was I wrong.  I do admit the WR cast looks better than that season, though."
CFB,3dtyqh,nuxenolith,4,Sun Jul 19 14:37:54 2015 UTC,My big worry is whether Kings will have off the field issues again.  IMO He's really the WR I have the most confidence in.
CFB,3dtyqh,swtwenty,3,Sun Jul 19 15:08:49 2015 UTC,I'm not too worried about WR. Who thought Lippett would have the year he did last year?  I'm sure somebody else will do the same if necessary.
CFB,3dtyqh,nuxenolith,3,Sun Jul 19 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"Our Top 5 is the same five guys, but I left out Davis, Kings, and London in favor of Shelton, Burbridge, and Williams."
CFB,3dtyqh,swtwenty,2,Sun Jul 19 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"How come you left Davis out? To me he seems like our best LB, poised for a big year"
CFB,3dtyqh,nuxenolith,3,Sun Jul 19 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Our LB corps was so underwhelming last season, I honestly don't have much of an opinion on him.  You're probably right, though."
CFB,3dtyqh,JayMoney2424,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think the LBs improve a lot this year. The DL will be the strength and the OL's #1 priority, hopefully allowing the LBs more room and time to work. Plus, as much as I liked Taiwan Jones, I think Riley Bullough will be better at running the defense. Jones had a good year and did as well as could be expected for being thrown into a tough new position, but I think Riley could be Max Jr. out there."
CFB,3dtyqh,toolfreak,3,Sun Jul 19 17:12:27 2015 UTC,We're entering a new Golden Era of Bulloughs.
CFB,3dtyqh,JohnnyManziel2,3,Sun Jul 19 17:28:59 2015 UTC,I would've put Brian Allen or McDowell instead of London I think Brian might end up being even better than Jack and McDowell is gonna be a force.
CFB,3dtyqh,mjacksongt,15,Sun Jul 19 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'm doing this mostly in the order I remember them in. Might edit the order once I'm off mobile.   Justin Thomas - Jr QB, he's incredibly fast, makes good decisions and seems to be have that something that just makes everyone around him play a little better. He's a gamechanger and we're going to need that this year because our skill positions are very young. Adam Gotsis - Sr DT, he's technically undersized for DT but he plays very well and eats a lot of double teams to let the DEs do some work. He can get into the backfield himself some too obviously. He's on some awards watch lists and probably will be drafted. He is probably the biggest defensive name we have. DJ White - Sr CB, he's made some amazing plays last year sealing a few games and changing the momentum of others. He's our best corner in coverage and flies to the ball even if the play is away from him. Tech fans love him but he wasn't on any All-ACC preseason teams that I've seen. I think he could be drafted if he has a good senior season, and I expect him to. Jabari Hunt - Sr DT, this guy is hard to place. He was a player to watch out for in the freshman year, but that was at linebacker. He got buried in the depth chart with a changing scheme, but grew into a DE just in time to be declared academically ineligible for his junior season. He grew even more and is now a DT. He's scary though. He's still really fast and physical. I think he'll change our DL into a good one by himself. He was the defensive scout team player of the year if I remember correctly, and I've even seen him on some draft lists even though he's yet to play a game at DT. He could be #2 by the end of the year but we just haven't seen him in a game in a while. Freddie Burden - Jr (?) C, he's fast and plays hard. He beat out an older guy for the center spot last year and probably will be our best OL unless someone else steps up. Jamal Golden - Sr S, he also has a knack for big plays like DJ White does. He hits decently hard but mostly can seem to instinctively know where a play will go and puts himself in the right spots. I don't think he'll get drafted but it is possible. Most likely he'll sign a UDFA and who really knows from there. He's also our kick returner and did really well in 2012 but after injury in 2013, there just wasn't the same electricity in 2014. I hope it comes back next year as he's likely to remain on returning duties. Broderick Snoddy - Sr A back, he's really our only other returning skill guy who has real yardage outside of Justin Thomas. Last year it looked like the track star had finally figured football out. He ran hard and could make something out of nothing. But he broke his leg against Clemson and missed all of spring practice too. He's still starting, and I hope it's with the same fire as last year. Keshun Freeman - So DE, he was a very pleasant surprise last year, earning the starting spot mid season as a true freshman. He was a freshman all American and probably one of the only players stopping a complete defensive collapse. With another year of college training and experience, the only reason he won't turn heads is if Jabari or Gotsis get to the QB first. PJ Davis - Jr LB, he is a tackling machine. He's a little small but he his hard and flies to the ball. He can be very disruptive in the backfield as well. I'm not sure how good his coverage is but he's likely to be one of the tackling leaders on the team. I'm going to put a tie between Errin Joe at RT and Brian Chamberlain at LT. The decision was hard and they have similar stories. Both were disappointments in 2013 and a lot of fans were unhappy that they were gong to start in 2014. It was seen as a sign that our OL was going to suck because even the bad players were keeping their jobs. They both did incredibly well in 2014 though, showing that they had earned their starts. I don't know about drafts but Shaq Mason at RG got drafted last year so it's technically possible from our OL even without the pass blocking experience. They may be asked to play guard in the NFL but it could work out."
CFB,3dtyqh,toolfreak,6,Sun Jul 19 15:35:33 2015 UTC,This list is just one example of why their defense is going to be raw.
CFB,3dtyqh,ChedduhBob,5,Sun Jul 19 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"As an ND fan, I'm not really looking forward to facing Thomas, GT, and the flexbone.  I'm glad you guys lost like your top 20 RB's though."
CFB,3dtyqh,mjacksongt,5,Sun Jul 19 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's going to hurt.  Offensive losses:   Top 3 B-backs (fullbacks), as well as the presumptive starter (ACL) and an early enrollee who was in the conversation for the starting job early spring (foot).   Losses were due to graduation (3) and injury (2) They will be replaced by Marcus Allen (came in as a B-back, moved to LB, now moved back - he impressed in the Spring) and Patrick Skov (huge graduate transfer from Stanford, where he was largely a blocking fullback and short-yardage specialist).  5 of top 6 A-Backs (wingbacks).   Losses due to graduation (4) and dismissal (1 dismissed for violation of team rules, likely due to marjiuana testing policy) They will be replaced by the 1 returnee (Snoddy - fastest player on team), a couple redshirt freshman, 1 former walk-on (RS Jr that has seen some action...very little meaningful), and likely at least 1 true freshman.  Top 2 wide receivers.   Losses due to graduation. They will be replaced by 1 RS Jr and a couple RS Sophomores.  It is likely that at least 1 true freshman will play.  None of the returnees have significant experience, at least catching the ball.  All are talented physically - they fit the ""GT Wide Receiver Mold"". These losses give me the most worry.  We can deal with 8 players in the box, but 9 tends to make the offense bad.  Top Offensive Lineman (RG)   Loss due to graduation. Will be replaced by The Mountain that Blocks (Shamire Devine).  Only concern with him is stamina - he has had weight problems in the past.  We're basically 2 deep across the offensive line with experience and proven talent - so this position isn't a huge concern."
CFB,3dtyqh,ChedduhBob,3,Sun Jul 19 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, more than the RBs though I think the lack of a WR on this list is what will kill us a few times. Our OL will get us yards but we're going to have to pass sometimes."
CFB,3dtyqh,temeraire34,3,Sun Jul 19 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"The only thing about the running backs is that it's just a plug and play position. We turn that position over so much that it's not too big of a worry.  Last year the offense got carried hard by the o-line and QB. Our b-backs weren't talented, they just ran hard through the holes provided. Days was a QB coming out of high school, and converted to an a back then to a b back. Laskey was a two star recruit coming out of high school.  Of quaide, skov and Allen can just run hard and not fumble we're fine. They aren't being asked to pick up 25 yards a run. Just gain positive yards and fall forward to pick up 4 and we're golden."
CFB,3dtyqh,FutzinChamp,8,Sun Jul 19 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"Both of them were some of the best B-Backs we could hope to have.  Days ran exceptionally hard, and Laskey hit the hole faster than anyone else.  Just because they weren't home run hitters doesn't mean they weren't good.  Also, they were both extremely solid on the mesh.  We're going to miss them a lot this year."
CFB,3dtyqh,OneManGOONsquad,4,Sun Jul 19 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"i dont think so. i think they are extremely replaceable talent, and i say that as someone who loved them both. their production was more of a product of the offensive line. i think as long as the o line stay healthy, we roll.  they did run hard and could run a lot, so i think if we go running back by committee with skov allen and quaide we should be okay. i think the injury to leggett actually does hurt because he looks like the best back we have recruited in a long time."
CFB,3dtyqh,mjacksongt,3,Sun Jul 19 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Whatever you think of their physical talent, Laskey and Days both had excellent field vision, probably the best we've had since Dwyer. They both knew exactly where the blocks were going and when to cut to get a little extra yardage. Laskey was particularly good at that, and I wouldn't be surprised if dive plays that he routinely took for 5-6 yards only go for 2-3 with the new guys because they're still getting used to the speed of that position.  Also, small note: there was a report one or two days go that Quaide won't be ready to resume football activities until probably October. So he's pretty much a lock to redshirt now."
CFB,3dtyqh,scottishfinn,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that while Days did great, he was still an A back after spring last year.  He transitioned really well and that's why I think we should be able to replace him and transition other runners there.  As long as they can run hard it should be ok.    Same thing if not more so with A back.  Last year we were worried about how we were going to replace Godhigh and we did alright."
CFB,3dtyqh,BatManatee,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:13 2015 UTC,Is JJ Green eligible this season?
CFB,3dtyqh,ReggieLeinart,6,Sun Jul 19 17:31:42 2015 UTC,No.  He'll be eligible in 2016.
CFB,3dtyqh,scottishfinn,13,Sun Jul 19 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"1. Myles Jack, JR LB: Freakish athlete at LB, excellent in coverage, allows UCLA to play all sorts of coverages while in their base 4-3. Jack is moving inside to fill Eric Kendricks' MLB role this season, so Jack's tackle numbers should go through the roof. With great depth in UCLA's backfield, expect Jack to get very little time at RB this year.  2. Paul Perkins, JR RB: The Pac-12's leading rusher in 2014 will be leaned on more this year as UCLA breaks in a new QB.  3. Kenny Clark, JR DT: Clark is a projected 1st round pick and arguably the best NT in the Pac-12.  4. Eddie Vanderdoes, JR DE: Vanderdoes is similar to Kenny Clark in terms of role on the team & draft projection. Very hyped coming out of high school, Vanderdoes has had injuries during the past couple offseasons. Injury-free so far in 2015, Vanderdoes could have a massive year and be one of the best D-Linemen in the country.  5. Jordan Payton, SR WR: UCLA's top WR from last year, in an offense that returns the majority of their pass-catchers. He's great at getting yards after the catch and caught the game-winning touchdown from Jerry Neuheisel against Texas last year.  6. Jake Brendel, SR C: Brendel has been the rock in the middle of our offensive line for the last couple of years, and will be a massive asset to Josh Rosen as he (likely) takes the reins under center this season.  7. Conor McDermott, SO OT: UCLA's offensive line stabilized after McDermott came back from injury last year (UCLA gave up 31 sacks over their first 9 games, and 10 over their last 4). McDermott has bulked up over the offseason, and should be excellent this season.  8. Fabian Moreau, SR CB: Moreau broke out during last year's fall camp, but struggled in games early on in the season. He has the ability to be a shutdown corner but just needs to put it all together on Saturdays.  9. Ishmael Adams, JR CB/PR/KR: Adams earns this ranking for his big-play ability on special teams, and is a threat to take it to the house at any time. He's only okay on defense, as his size (5'8, 170lbs) limits his ability to defend larger WRs. Marcus Rios will likely take over his spot across from Moreau, allowing Adams to only play nickel.  10. Thomas Duarte, JR WR: Duarte was a security blanket for Brett Hundley last year, coming up with big catches time and time again."
CFB,3dtyqh,BatManatee,4,Sun Jul 19 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"This is a really good list, but I'd move the order around a bit.   Jake Brendel, SR C: Brendel is top 5 nationally at his position. A couple of the games where UCLA fell apart in the last couple of years are because Brendel got injured. I think he's the most irreplaceable part of our team. Myles Jack: What you said. Kenny Clark: As you said, Clark and Vanderdoes have both been on preseason All Pac teams. They're monsters and should anchor a strong DLine this year. Eddie Vanderdoes: See above. Paul Perkins: I love Perkins, and I'm glad he's started to get some much needed respect this offseason. I think the 4 above him on my list are better at their positions, and I don't mean that as a slight to Perkins, the other 4 are just potential 1st or 2nd round draft picks. I'm excited to see Starks as a change of pace back this year. By all accounts he's improved in a big way this offseason. Fabian Moreau: What you said. Conor McDermott: What you said. Jordan Payton: Clearly the best WR we've got, and pretty consistent, but not usually a game-breaker. Deon Hollins JR LB: Hollins broke through at the end of last season and I think he's the best pass rusher we've got. He's disruptive in the same way Barr was. Ishmael Adams: Ish is a homerun type player. He's not always the best in coverage, but then he'll come up with an electric Pick-6 or return and make up for it."
CFB,3dtyqh,Daxapotamus,3,Sun Jul 19 16:45:21 2015 UTC,Going to be such a good game this year!
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,2,Sun Jul 19 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"This order makes sense to me. Truth be told, UCLA's roster doesn't have many elite players, but is loaded with really good players, so there isn't a completely clear top 10. Even outside of the players we've mentioned, you could argue that Kenny Young, Jaleel Wadood, Josh Rosen, Takk McKinley, and others could end up here at the end of the season."
CFB,3dtyqh,64voxac30,2,Sun Jul 19 20:21:33 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. We aren't too top heavy this year, but we are very deep and balanced. I think Brendel, Jack, Clark, and maybe Vanderdoes are our elite players as of right now. You could make a case for Perkins as well, he's on the border. If some combination of Moreau, Payton, Rosen can make the step forward to elite this year we will be really dangerous. Rios and Goforth are also players that may be able to reach that status as well.  We could really use one big time wide receiver. Someone who is a threat to take it to the house every down. I'd say Fuller would probably be my hope, he's got the speed for it, he's just not there yet."
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:44 2015 UTC,Kenny Clark scares me
CFB,3dtyqh,Witch_Docter77,41,Sun Jul 19 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"Denver Kirkland. Left tackle. 6'5"" 343 lbs. Junior. He'll be starting for his third year this fall and has been regarded by Bielema to be one of the best pass protecting linemen he's coached. He's got size and is a very disciplined player, rarely getting penalized. Hunter Henry. Tight end. 6'5"" 250 lbs. Junior. Like Kirkland, he's going to be entering his 3rd season as a starter. Kind of a throwback tight end, being a really good blocker on the edge and being a huge mismatch in the seam and the flats. Watch the last couple of drives we had against Mississippi State last year to get an idea of how clutch he is.  Sebastian Tretola. Left Guard. 6'5"" 322 lbs. Senior. Great interior linemen that is a mauler off the line, rarely getting pushed backwards.  Jonathan Williams. Running back. 6' 225 lbs. Senior. A well rounded running back that kills opponents with his balance. He lead the conference in broken tackles last year (65). Alex Collins. Running back. 5'11"" 215 lbs. Junior. Looking to be the 3rd back in SEC history to run for 3 consecutive 1,000 seasons (behind Herschel Walker and Darren McFadden). Very shifty back that can turn turn crease into 5 yards, and God have mercy if he gets the edge on you. Dan Skipper. Right tackle. 6'10"" 307 lbs. Junior. This will be his 3rd position on the OL in 3 years. He has a bit of a reputation of playing through the echoes of the whistle which gets him into trouble sometimes, but he's on of the most passionate and meanest guys on the field at any given time. He's at his best coming straight at the defense to seal off the edge for a run, something he'll do a lot of this season.  Brooks Ellis. Linebacker. 6'2"" 237 lbs. Junior. He played middle linebacker his first two years but is being put outside this year, which is the star role in Robb Smith's defensive scheme. Ellis is the leading returning tackler for Arkansas with 72 (?) and will be looking to rack up more this year. Not the big hitter that Spaight was last year, but Ellis forces fumbles well and got a few interceptions last year too, making him a really well rounded defender for us. Brandon Allen. Quaterback. 6'3"" 210 lbs. Senior. Allen will be going into his 3rd year as a starter. He doesn't have the biggest arm, but makes up for it with good decision making. His completion % is nothing to drool over, but his TD:INT numbers were great last year. If he can keep the turnovers down like he did last year but improve his completion %, which might be more on the receivers than him, he could really make this offense a threat in multiple facets. Taiwan Johnson. Defensive tackle. 6'2"" 273 lbs. Junior. Look for Taiwan to replace the production from Darius Philon last year, possibly even out producing him. Taiwan could be playing end, but with his height he's able to get good leverage on the interior of the line when combined with the speed of a DE.  Rohan Gaines. Strong safety. 5'11"" 195 lbs. Senior. Didn't cause a ton of turnovers (1 INT, 1 FF, 1 fumble recovery) but patrols the secondary very well. Gaines hits hard and often, whether in run support or crossing receivers. Gaines very well could be the senior leader on defense this year which will be an important role for us after losing 2 great ones in Martell Spaight and Trey Flowers."
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,10,Sun Jul 19 14:34:45 2015 UTC,And this is why I've been talkng about Arkansas for the at few months.
CFB,3dtyqh,Tacomeat10,3,Sun Jul 19 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"We're finally loaded with experience at crucial positions, I'm just hoping it all clicks now and we can close out games."
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,7,Sun Jul 19 18:34:51 2015 UTC,How is y'alls future O-Line/RB recruiting going? I see most of your big boys are Juniors or Seniors and so are your two running backs. Do you expect to keep this running success after they leave?
CFB,3dtyqh,Tacomeat10,7,Sun Jul 19 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"We've recruited really well along the OL. We had an all-SEC freshmen center last year, Frank Ragnow, who will start at right guard for us this year. We have a couple guys that we redshirted like Brian Wallace, who will most likely see some limited time this year. I'm not overly concerned with the OL, we've been able to sign 2-3 highly recruited guys every class since Bret has been here so we should be set.   As far as RB, I'm not as confident. There's a chance we lose Collins to the draft early so we'd be losing both him and Williams. Kody Walker was granted a 6th year of eligibility for 2016, so assuming he comes back we'll at least have someone with experience coming back. Juan Day was supposed to be the successor at RB after redshirting last year, but tore his ACL this past Spring which will keep him out this whole season. Day had injury problems in high school too which makes me very worried. We got a guy last year, Rawleigh Williams, who will probably get redshirted this year but could end up being our compliment to Kody Walker in 2016 if Day can't stay healthy.  OL: No real worries here. Recruiting has been good and development is even better.  RB: Worried about depth for the foreseeable future (this recruiting class is crucial to get a couple RBs), but the few players we have here for the future should be good. Having a good OL will also assuage some of the problems here."
CFB,3dtyqh,pinwheelpride,2,Sun Jul 19 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"From what I heard reported Rawleigh is the real deal, very fast and hard to tackle. If we get Devwah Whaley or Devin white to commit we shouldn't see much of a drop off in the run game! Especially with the o line we have in place."
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,2,Sun Jul 19 21:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm excited for Rawleigh I just wish we had more depth around him. That's why this class is going to be crucial for us   We're high on a few running backs list which is encouraging, I just hope we can land one or two!"
CFB,3dtyqh,EnterTheWayne,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:50 2015 UTC,Agreed
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,7,Sun Jul 19 22:05:31 2015 UTC,Jesus christ the size of those offensive linemen!
CFB,3dtyqh,WallMaria,4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:14 2015 UTC,Sounds fair to say you guys are going to be pounding the rock this year.
CFB,3dtyqh,TheFoxForce5Joke,4,Sun Jul 19 14:42:43 2015 UTC,"That's the plan. I'm sure we'll try and throw it around because Allen proved himself to be a good decision maker, but as far as I'm concerned the wide receivers are sub par. A few could come up and surprise us this year, but with how loaded we are on the line and at RB I'd be surprised to see us throw any more than necessary."
CFB,3dtyqh,emperorakira,3,Sun Jul 19 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: when he leaves, Hunter Henry might be the best damn tight end to ever play at Arkansas."
CFB,3dtyqh,ghetto_draco,3,Sun Jul 19 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he comes back for his senior year, that'd be such a great target for whoever we have to break in at QB.  He's definitely up there as one of the best. I'm partial to DJ Williams though."
CFB,3dtyqh,gordo865,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:47 2015 UTC,Yeah DJ Williams is the gold standard for an Arkansas TE.
CFB,3dtyqh,WeazelBear,2,Sun Jul 19 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"My money is on Jeremy Sprinkle being a great replacement for Henry.  I graduated with the guy, and he is talented, the fastest TE out of the bunch and a smart, smart guy. Be looking out for him this year."
CFB,3dtyqh,gordo865,10,Sun Jul 19 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"Samaje Perine (RB-soph) had 1713 yards and 21 TDs on the ground last year as true freshman despite not starting until mid season.  Excellent combination vision, balance and power.  The only question is how many carries will he get in Lincoln Riley's new air Raid offense. Sterling Shepard (WR-Sr.) was on pace to be an all American last year until he got hurt against Iowa State, and still made 1st team all big 12 despite missing half the season.  He was the OU passing attack last year, and should be excellent this year if he stays healthy. Eric Striker (OLB-Sr.) is an absolute terror of a pass rusher, and solid in zone coverage.  He's undersized at 6'0"" 230 pounds, but his first step and acceleration are just too much for most LTs to handle.  Expect him to continue living in the backfield for the third straight year. Alex Ross (KR/RB-Jr.) good, but not great as a running back but possibly the best kick returner in the country.  He scored two return touchdowns last year, and brought another inside the 5.  He should also be effective as a relief RB, who could start at a lot of schools, but is behind one the elite talents in the country. Charles Tapper (DE-Sr.) had an excellent 2013 but a quiet 2014.  Partly because he wasn't used as aggressively as a pass rusher.  He was mostly asked to set the edge as a 3-4 end last while the OLBs Striker and Grissom went after the QB.  He's expect to bounce back this year as the lone returning DL starter, and shift towards more 4 man fronts. Zach Sanchez (CB-Jr.)  is up there with best of them at making plays on the ball, but is a poor tackler.  Really hobbled last year by a lingering shoulder injury and an inability to trust the safeties over the top. He's inconsistent but has the potential to be elite. Ty Darlington (C-Sr.) is one of 2 returning OL starters, and is the leader of the group.  Doesn't have elite measurables, but is smart as hell, and an experienced starter. Dede Westbrook (WR-Jr.) a JUCO transfer from Blinn College.  He was a JUCO all American last year.  He has elite speed and is expected to rack up yards from the slot in the new air raid offense. Joe Mixon (RB-Fr.) was the star of the 2014 class, but was suspended for assault before the season started, now he's back.  He's the lightning to Perine's thunder, and should thrive off screen passes in this offense. Jordan Evans (ILB-Jr.) this was the hardest spot to pick.  I picked Evans because he has the highest ceiling of the 3 ILBs fighting for 2 spots.  He is an excellent coverage linebacker having played safety in HS.  He is not bad against the run, and should improve with experience. He's competing with Dom Alexander who is a tackling machine, but never really makes splash plays and Frank Shannon who is returning from suspension, and is good against both the pass and the run, but doesn't have the physical tools Evans has, relying more on experience.   HM: the QB.  The QB is not fully settled between Trevor Knight and Baker Mayfield.  The Air Raid should make whoever wins the job look good, but I haven't seen enough from either of the to warrant a top 10 ranking yet.  I love linemen, but could only include 2 of them because there are only 3 returning starters on both sides of the ball."
CFB,3dtyqh,RobertNeyland,2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"I think I'd put Tapper below Sanchez and Darlington. Also, Dominique Alexander and Frank Shannon should be ahead of Mixon and Evans, maybe even higher than that."
CFB,3dtyqh,MisterFalcon7,19,Sun Jul 19 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"1. Curt Maggitt-OLB/DE (rSr) Tremendous pass rusher. Was recruited as a OLB and was great his freshman year. Got hurt as a sophomore and missed most of the season and his recovery took long enough that we decided to just redshirt him in 2013. Came back last season and was an emotional leader as well as a leader on the field collecting 11 sacks. 2. Derek Barnett-DE (So) Came in last year as a true freshman and surpassed Clowney's record for sacks as a true freshman. He's got the potential to be something special down the line. 3. Cam Sutton-CB (Jr) Was borderline shutdown as a true freshman. Flew under the radar as a recruit but was the starter the second fall practice started. Played well last year getting a few picks and almost doubling his pass break-ups. Very solid tackler for a corner. It's been said that he evaluates better as a Nickel at the next level. Quick and fast, but not a burner and not afraid to lower his shoulder.  4. Jalen Reeves-Maybin-LB (Jr) Recruited as a safety and was converted into a OLB halfway through his freshman year. Was a special teams monster his freshman year while he bulked up. Started last year still a little undersized playing at probably around 225 or so. Racked up over 100 tackles in his first full year as a starter. Comes into this season as a guy that is somehow flying under the radar. He's smart and he knows how to direct the defense. He's a leader. Could potentially get a good number of reps at MLB this year with us trying to find a replacement for AJ Johnson.  5. Alvin Kamara-RB (rSo) Everything we've been hearing about this guy is that he's gonna be special. Hurd is probably higher on most peoples list and rightfully so, but Kamara I have a feeling is gonna be our homerun threat this year. 6. Jalen Hurd-RB (So) He was phenomenal last year behind one of the worst offensive lines Tennessee has ever put on the field. He can move the chains. Big boy at 6'3 and he's said to have bulked up over 240. Managed to get 900 yards on the ground last year behind a pathetic line and if you watch the way he runs you can see why. If there's not a hole he makes one. Forceful runner and can move the pile.  7. Brian Randolph-S (rSr) Has been our leader through the good and the bad on defense. The most experienced player on defense. Not a tremendous athlete but he's a good, smart football player. 8. Pig Howard-WR (Sr) He's our slot guy. Has lead the team in receptions the last 2 years. Very ""twitchy"" as some of the pro scouts like to say. Quick feet and thankfully so considering he's only 5'8 and maybe 190 soaking wet. Not a burner or a deep threat, but a very solid safety valve in the slot. Wes Welker type player.  9. Jashon Robertson-RG (So) Many seem to over look this kid. Came in last year as a DT and within the first week of fall camp we gave him a shot at guard. He was instantly our best O-Lineman. He's a potential 1st or 2nd rounder in a couple years.  10. Joshua Dobbs-QB (Jr) I know some people probably have him higher, but I was close to not including him on the list at all. He's a solid runner and having him in there opens holes for Hurd and Kamara in the running game and makes the OL's job easier in pass protection. Inconsistent as a passer though. Struggled against better defenses like Mizzou and not so better defenses like Vandy. Cautiously optimistic that we have the best QB in the SEC East for 2015.    Honorable mentions:  Marquez North-WR (Jr) Von Pearson-WR (Sr) pending his suspension Ethan Wolf-TE (So) LaDarrell McNeil-S (Sr) Corey Vereen-DE (Jr) Danny O'Brien-DT (Jr) Kahlil McKenzie-DT (Fr)"

There's still quite a bit of talent outside your honorable mentions. I, too, am excited to see Kamara, but I think Hurd plays with tremendous emotion this year and proves a lot to people."
CFB,3dtyqh,rubixor,3,Sun Jul 19 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"Yea I probably could have thrown the 2 deep at both safety spots, Emmanuel Moseley, and maybe Croom on the list/honorable mention....people will find out soon enough though haha."

The only side note I would add to Dobbs is that he did well against Bama and he was completely on his own against Vandy since Hurd went out on the first series and our receiving corps was the walking wounded at that point. He willed our team to victory that day with his running ability."
CFB,3dtyqh,HillsboroughAtheos,19,Sun Jul 19 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"1. A'Shawn Robinson, DL: Can play anywhere on the DL.  Best DL since Marcel Dareus.  2. Jarran Reed, DL: 54 tackles last season, JUCO transfer who would have been a likely day 2 pick if he left early last year.  3. Jonathan Allen, DL: Yes I think the three defensive linemen are the top 3 players at Alabama right now...  4. Cameron Robinson, LT: What he did as a true freshman at LT was amazing, looking forward to seeing what his future holds.  5. Reggie Ragland, LB: Glad to see he has put it together to become a big time LBer.  He isn't CJ Mosley, but he is pretty damn good.  6. Derrick Henry, RB: I like Henry, but for a big guy he can run soft.  He is at his best running in space (see toss sweeps against Ohio State for example).   7. Cyrus Jones, CB: Quietly put together a good season last year at a spot that troubled Alabama he will be counted on to be steady again this year as well.  8. Kenyan Drake, RB: Sounds like he has fully recovered from the broken leg from last year.  Playmaker.  9. Ryan Kelly, C: Alabama only returns 2 starters from the OL, they at least play the 2 most important positions on the OL and are talented as hell.  10. J.K. Scott, P: OK I should have him higher on this list, but I just can't have a punter that high...He is great though, probably the best in the nation."
CFB,3dtyqh,UF0118,3,Sun Jul 19 15:17:33 2015 UTC,I think we win more games this year from JK Scott than any other player on the team.
CFB,3dtyqh,s-to-the-am,4,Mon Jul 20 01:12:21 2015 UTC,I still have nightmares about J.K. Scott....
CFB,3dtyqh,thorvaldnotnora,9,Sun Jul 19 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"Let me try this:   Gabe Marks - WR-Z, RSJR: Probably the most dynamic player on the team. While he missed all of last season because of injury, he could have played in the later half but the coaching staff decided to redshirt him. Had 74 catches for 807 yards as a sophomore in 2013 and now that Mayle and Myers is gone, I expect him to be one of the best receivers in the conference. River Cracraft - WR-Y, JR: Our key slot guy, Cracraft was recently put on the Biletnikoff Watch List. Put up 771 yards on 66 yards last year in only 9 games due to injury. Was Connor Halliday's favorite target. We'll see if he can build chemistry with Luke Falk. I hate to do this but he does have some Wes Welker in him haha. Jeremiah Allison - WILL, SR: After spending his first 2 and a half seasons mostly on special teams, Allison finally got to start at WILL linebacker against Oregon. From then on, he's been one of the most consistent defensive players on this team. At this point, he's probably one of the most sure tacklers on this team. Joe Dahl - LT, RSSR. Dahl has had an interesting career path. Committed to Montana out of high school over an offer from WSU. Redshirted at Montana and then transfered back to WSU as a walk-on. After sitting out his RSFR year, he starts every game at LG as a RSSO. Then for the bowl game, he switches to LT and it works out great. Moved there full time as a RSJR. Was named to the Outland Watch list just recently. His growth has been fairly impressive over the last few years and has made a shitty O-Line less shitty. Kache Palacio - RUSH, SR: Our main pass rusher, Palacio had 6.5 sacks last season. He's not that big, only being 6'2"", 230 or so but he's one of those big motor guys that never gives up as cliche as that sounds. Luke Falk - QB, RSSO: I suppose 6 is a good place for Falk, who has also had an interesting story. Turned down an offer from Cornell to walk on at WSU. Spent 3 out of his 4 years of high school in the air raid. Had a segment on CNN about him and his parents. And it's now his turn to lead this football team. In the short amount of time he played last year, there was a lot of good and a lot of bad. Threw some nasty interceptions while down but so did Halliday when he first got going.  But unlike Halliday, Falk can run a little bit and also seems to be less likely to go for the home run ball. Honestly, this season is dependent on how well he does. Dom Williams - WR-X, RSSR: Dom Williams is the deep threat on this football team. Averaged 15 yards per catch last season and averaged 16 yards per catch in each of the 2 seasons before that. Does have some issues with drops though. And while Halliday liked going deep, we'll have to see what the relationship between Falk and Williams will be like. Peyton Pelluer - MIKE, RSSO: Pelluer took over the Mike linebacker spot from Daryl Monroe last season and ran with it. Kinda hard to talk about a linebacker, not really a sexy position but I thought he did a good job for a freshman. With another year of experience, he should be a good linebacker period. Jamal Morrow/Gerard Wicks - RB, RSSO: Our tandem speed/power combo combined for about 550 yards rushing and another 450 yards receiving last year as freshmen. While the Air Raid isn't known for running a whole lot, it's important to get yards when they do. This combo averaged only 3.9 yards or so per carry and it really should be up closer to 4.5-5. Part of that can be the line or it could be them. Morrow did have some explosiveness catching the ball out of the backfield though. Gunnar Eklund - LG, RSSR: Not sure what to say here, been a solid lineman the last two years. Was a former walk-on who eventually earned the starting LT role before moving to LG last year.  Destiny Vaeao - DL, SR: Born in Pago Pago, Vaeao has moved around quite a bit in his career here in WSU. At 300 pounds, he's spent time inside at DT, outside on the end and even some time at linebacker as a run stuff guy. This season, it looks like he will go back to DT and be one of the key cogs in the middle."
CFB,3dtyqh,dubya_a,10,Sun Jul 19 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"I'll give ours a go.  Jalen Ramsey - Do it all DB. He can generate pressure off the edge, lock up 1v1 with anyone on an opposing offense, play the centerfielder, stuff the run, etc. The guy is a freak and a future 1st rounder after this year.  Dalvin Cook - Most skilled RB FSU has had in a long time. He's a complete package. This is assuming he still plays for us come fall.  Roderick Johnson - He had a huge impact when we finally pulled the trigger and put this guy in at LT. We had allowed 19 sacks in 8 games vs. FBS opponents before the move was made. Omly 4 sacks allowed by the OL in the 5 games following the transition. Dante Fowler said he, along with Cam Robinson, were the best OL he faced all year and Mario Ewards said once he got his hands on you, it was over. 6'7 300+ pounds of badass.  Roberto Aguayo - Best FG kicker in the country. Has only missed 4 kicks in his career, all of them from 40+ yards out. It's great to have that kind of consistent weapon on your team.  Derwin James - I know, I know, he's just a freshman. He's got 3 and done written all over him. He's fast, hits like a Mike Tyson uppercut, and has the instincts to be a future cornerstone on FSU's defense.  George Campbell - Another freshman? WTF am I smoking? Like Derwin, this guy is an EE and a freakish athlete. It miht take a bit to hit his stride, but he's got allthe talent to be FSU's next 1st round WR and he showed that in the spring game.  Everett Golson - He has turnover issues but he also threw for nearly 3,500 yards and 30 TD's after missing all of 2013. I think a change of scenery cobined with not being asked to do too much will work wonders for him. I don't expect a savior, just a good QB.  Terrance Smith - He was forced in the lineup in early 2013 and he's done well. He caught the injury bug a bit last year, along with every other LB, and he'll be loking to leave his final mark this year.  Travis Rudolph - He flashed quite a bit last year but never found a groove. I think that was a combination of freshman mistakes and Jameis over relying on Greene and O'Leary for better or worse. I think he'll be a consistent weapon this year with more than enough skill to be a star.  Trey Marshall - Taking over the Star position for Ramsey. This position is arguably the most important on the defense, and Jimbo and/or Kelly wouldn't push Jalen outside if they werent completely comfortable with who was taking over. The position requirements mixed with the skill Trey flashed late in '14, make me pretty confident he's going to break out this year.  Honorable Mentions: Mario Pender, Jaques Patrick, DeMarcus Walker, Matthew Thomas, and Nate Andrews.  Also I did this on my PS4 so hopefully it doesn't look like shit."
CFB,3dtyqh,AUae13,6,Sun Jul 19 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"I like Demarcus Walker in Smith's spot. Those LBs were bad when they were healthy, and we'll have to play a lot of nickel base this year. We've got about 3 100% players there now, and I see the rest being completely useless. We're putting the team cooks at LB but we don't have enough cooks.  Great list throughout, though. Very knowledgeable :)"
CFB,3dtyqh,bakerman2017,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"Damarcus Walker, Derrick Nandi/Christmas/Stamples/Stanely our DT's are going to be a big surprise to a lot of fans this year I think. Chris Casher depending on his health. Reggie Northrup depending on health. Nate Andrews is top 10 if I made one he is severely underrated going to be a round 2-3 draft pick."
CFB,3dtyqh,FloridaLynx,17,Sun Jul 19 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"LSU Tigers  1. Leonard Fournette: SO, RB #7, 6'1"" 230 lbs. Fournette was the top overall prospect in the country in the 2014 recruiting class. Starting RB in deep committee and primary kickoff returner. Finished 2014 with over 1000 yards and 10 TDs. Preseason 1st Team All-SEC RB, 2nd Team All-Purpose Player, 3rd Team Return Specialist.

Another versatile player, has started at both CB and FS and projects as either at the next level. Expected to be an early-round pick in 2016. 62 tackles, 3 TFL, 1 INT, 5 pass breakups, 6 passes defensed, 1 fumble recovery in 2014. Career Highlights  4.

Massive thumping linebacker who fills gaps well and attacks the ball carrier. 77 tackles, 7.5 TFLs, 2 Sacks, 1 INT, 3 pass breakups, 4 passes defensed, 2 fumble recoveries in 2014. May go pro following 2015 season.  6. Travin Dural: JR, WR #83, 6'2"" 192 lbs. Football and track standout in high school. Won state title in 200 meters, and 4x200 relay. 6'10"" high jump.

Big Cat drill vs. backup center Karl (KJ) Malone Jr.  9. Jamal Adams: SO, SS #33, 6'0"" 206 lbs. Preseason 3rd Team All-SEC. 2014 Freshman All American. Finished 2014 with 66 tackles, 5 TFL, 1 sack, 5 pass breakups and 5 passes defensed. May be more known for flopping against Florida and Ole Miss, but showed last season that he has a tenacity and nose for the ball. Probably talks more trash than any other player on the team. My personal favorite player to watch on defense. Highlights  10. Ethan Pocic: JR, OG/C #77, 6'7"" 301 lbs. Utility man for the O-Line. Can play any of the 5 positions. Not expected to leave early this year but will play at the next level. Older brother was a 3-year starter on o-line at Illinois."
CFB,3dtyqh,Red261,3,Sun Jul 19 19:07:34 2015 UTC,Hard to not see Malachi Dupre or Deion Jones on this list but no big disagreements.
CFB,3dtyqh,penguinoftroy,17,Sun Jul 19 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"Auburn  1) Duke Williams, WR. Duke was one of the better WRs in CFB last year, and a fringe first round pick. This year, he's almost a lock for the first round (in a shallower draft class) and likely to be our first 1000 yard receiver in living memory.  2) Carl Lawson, DE. Lawson was out last year, but if he comes back healthy, he'll add some spark to a pass rush that was a little limited last year. He was a Freshman All-American before tearing his ACL   3) Alex Kozan, OG. In a familiar story, Kozan was a Freshman All-American before getting hurt and missing last year. If he comes back healthy, he adds experience and talent to an OL interior that lost a lot of both last year.   4) Avery Young, RT. Young's played at LT, LG, RG, and RT, and practiced at Center. He's a monster as a run blocker, and a pretty good pass blocker as well. Young was widely considered a draftable prospect last year, but elected to return and improve his stock.  5) Jonathan Jones, CB. Jones, Lawson, and Williams were all picked first-team all-SEC last week. Jones' development into a quality corner has been frankly surprising - he was a fairly unheralded recruit, and redshirted his first year with a broken foot. However, if he becomes a true shut-down corner, it'll give Will Muschamp's defense a dangerous amount of flexibility.  6) Jeremy Johnson, QB. Johnson has very little experience, but has phenomenal physical tools and all the credentials to be a great QB. If he plays to his ceiling, he's 1st on this list. If he plays to his floor, he's about 40th. I'm leaning towards optimism, but it's still up in the air.   7) Montravious Adams, DT. The former 5* recruit has been very good, but not great in his playing time to date. With the departure of virtually every other DT on the depth chart, this is his time to emerge. He'll have good DEs playing beside him and good LBs behind him, so this is a favorable situation and he has the tools to make the most of it.   8) Cassanova McKinzey, LB. Good LB. Likes Chik-fil-A. Not a coverage all-star, but he comes down-hill against the run very well. Since Fournette, Chubb, Henry, and Collins are all lurking on our schedule, that's not such a bad trade to make. The thing to watch here is how quickly he learns Muschamp's defense; he's had trouble adjusting to new schemes in the past.  9) Jovon Robinson, RB. After a very, very strange recruitment, Jovon Robinson is back at Auburn. Last year's #1 JUCO recruit is next years #1 SEC rusher.  10) Rudy Ford, FS. Ford came to Auburn as a RB, flirted with playing CB, and was a pretty good safety last year. He's not big, but he has electric speed and helps to cover a lot of gambles from the corners. I'm expecting him to improve a great deal as he learns the positin"
CFB,3dtyqh,aj258,4,Sun Jul 19 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"Johnson has very little experience, but has phenomenal physical tools and all the credentials to be a great QB. If he plays to his ceiling, he's 1st on this list. If he plays to his floor, he's about 40th.   I like your take here."
CFB,3dtyqh,parkerstadium,4,Sun Jul 19 17:07:17 2015 UTC,I would move Cass up a few spots and add Kris Frost to this list. Most athletic LB and perfect compliment to Cass.
CFB,3dtyqh,sportingglobe,21,Sun Jul 19 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"2015-16 University of Southern California  Edit: Replaced Steven Mitchell with Kevon Seymour   1) Su'a Cravens - Linebacker / Safety Hybrid   People claim he's a tweener - realistically he's the best CFB SS in the country turned into a OLB. Has similar playstyle to Kam Chancellor (Not quite as tall) but can do a bit of everything, including play running back if in desperation.  Will lead USC in sacks and TFL, will lead USC linebackers in PD/interceptions probably, has extremely good coverage skills with rushing skills. 1st round expectations. He is similar to 1st rounder Shaq Thompson but a lot faster than 4.7 40.   2) Adoree' Jackson - DB/WR/KR    If Adoree' Jackson was 1-3 inches taller,  he would be the next Deion Sanders or Charles Woodson. His height is literally the only knock against Adoree. IMHO, best returner in the country. He is our best coverage corner by far. Most talented player on the team and easily the fastest. He has the best feet and natural instincts for a USC corner that we've EVER had.  I can't think of a cornerback in the last 25 years at USC that is better than Adoree' Jackson, only Iman 'Biggie' Marshall has the potential to one-up Adoree in corner back skills. He will play offense, defense, and special teams.   3) Cody Kessler - QB   Will be the most efficient QB coming into next season in all of CFB, with 39 TDs and 5 Interceptions (He had around 25 TDs before his first INT), that being said, Cody Kessler plays like the most ideal game manager. This isn't a knock on Cody, but he doesn't have the strongest arm (he can sling it far), but his accuracy is on-point. His strongest asset is his pocket presence  - he's very good at evading rushes and knows when to throw the ball away. We're expecting him to top his numbers with our deep receiving core, but not sure if we can expect him to top his numbers from last season - he needs to learn to play better against better teams because majority of his stats are inflated against the likes of Cal and Colorado.   4) Ju Ju Smith - WR   Ju Ju Smith is the next prolific WR talent to come from the Tee Martin pipeline behind Robert Woods, Marqise Lee, and Nelson Agholor. He had flashes of amazing athleticism and out of the last 3 great WRs that USC had, he has the biggest build and the strongest of the 4 by far. He looked like a man-child last season despite only being 17, he's finally 18 and fully grown, expect him to be the best WR in the Pac12 (this isn't a knock on other receivers, but Ju Ju has the best tools to be one of the best wide receivers). He is built like Dez Bryant, will be the main wide-out in a  huge group of WR talent.   5) Max Tuerk - Center   People debate between Nick Martin and Max Tuerk on which is the best center in the country. I have not studied enough film on Nick Martin, but I do know Max Tuerk is our best lineman and he's known as 'Army Knife' or 'Swiss-Army Lineman' among his teammates because he can play Tackle, Center, and Guard. He is built like a tackle but coordinated enough to play Center. He will excel at Guard in the NFL but he can play center ... His main knock is that he has an awkward ball delivery (hikes the ball with the tail-end, this is due to how tall he is and his arm is not as comfortable hiking in normal stance, so he hikes it with an upward delivery opposed to snapper stance).   6) Kevon Seymour - DB   Kevon Seymour is a veteran CB who's been starting the past 3~ seasons. He's our most consistent corner back and can arguably guard anyone in the Pac-12. He's easily forgotten due to his lack of highlights and hype compared to Adoree' and Iman Marshall, but he is a staple on our defensive back 4. He's consistent and makes plays when needed, he has a quiet demeanor but is one of the biggest leaders on this team especially in the back 7.   7) Anthony Sarao - OLB / MLB   Anthony will be one of the first 5 year RS Senior guys we've had in an extremely long time due to sanctions. He has started every season and I'm surprised he hasn't jumped to the NFL yet. He has the same skill set as Hayes Pullard, doesn't miss tackles very often and has a high IQ.  Sarao is one of the few scholar-athletes on the team and it's the main reason he stayed for grad school besides being slightly undersized for his position. I expect him and Lamar Dawson to be amazing along with Su'a at the linebacker position.   8) Antwaun Woods - Nose Tackle   I don't agree with the above poster's list as Antwaun Woods being our best DL, he's a great nose tackle and plugs the hole but he's extremely undersized for a nose tackle - 6'0 and 330 LBS.   He is not as good as Issac Gross from Ole Miss (who's an undersized NT as well), he does his job and if he can avoid injuries. He's never been beat at his position, but he doesn't have the explosion to be a sack threat and this doesn't command a double team quite as often.  Kenny Bigelow (former 5) will our best DT if he stays healthy. His flashes in the Spring always remind me why he was a 5 talent. Kenny is coming off of an ACL injury.   9) Justin Davis - RB   He will be our starting running back, he's basically a home run threat. He's not an inside runner, but if he gets to the outside he can get a gear or two to go the distance. If he becomes more of a complete runner this season, he will have a big season.   10) Toa Lobendahn - OL   Toa is in the same mold as Max Tuerk, he can play tackle / guard / center. He came in as a early enrollee and met his expectations as a coaches son. Most USC fans do not realize, but Toa's dad was head coach of Lakewood High for many years and his son is a reflection of his dad's training. Toa will play guard/tackle for us this season but his absolute future is at center. He is our back-up center and center from 2016 onwards.   Honorable Mentions: Zach Banner and Our Offensive Line   Zach Banner is huge. He possibly the biggest OT in all of CFB. 6'9' 350 LBS, he is the son of Lincoln Kennedy former OT of the Seattle Seahawks. His size helps on special teams, but he still has some problems with speed rushers. He states he'll get his weight down to hopefully 310, but I'm expecting 330.. If he can get his weight down and become more mobile he will be a great OT.   Chad Wheeler, 6'7"" 300 LBS, our LT is a better lineman but he has the opposite problem of needing to gain more weight.  Damien Mama is a monster of a human being and is doing well getting his freshman weight down from almost 400 LBS, 6'4-6'5. If he was conditioned better he'd probably be the 2nd best lineman.  Viane Talamaivao plays guard and he's the 3rd of the Samoan trio (Toa, Damien, Viane). He is the best conditioned, put the best results, and will be a solid guard until he's drafted into the NFL barring injury. I have no complaints about Viane and he does the best he can with the tools that he has, 6'3 320 LBS --- The OL always say in interviews that they think Viane is the most talented, I'm hoping he lives up to that expectation.  Khaleil Rodgers, he's a little undersized at 6'1-6'2', but he's a rock of an offensive lineman. Think of an immovable stump, if he gets his hands on a DL, that guy is neutralized for the rest of the play. Our offensive line is so stacked that he's the 7th man in rotation.  Chuma Udoga - Super Freshman 5* from Georgia, if our offensive line wasn't so stacked he'd be starting. He has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman, he's currently the backup RT. He can play guard or RT."
CFB,3dtyqh,Da_Oreo_King,5,Sun Jul 19 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"This description of USC reminds me of Bama in 2012. Game manager  QB, great O-line, several stars on defense, great WR."
CFB,3dtyqh,mjacksongt,5,Sun Jul 19 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"That's a solid list, though I think leaving Kevon Seymour out is an oversight. (and an entirely too common one at that) It's easy to forget about Kevon because Adoree' already is one of the best cornerbacks to ever wear cardinal and gold, but I think one of the big reasons he was able to thrive in 2014 is that Seymour was there to take some pressure off."

CFB,3dtyqh,tc316tc,4,Sun Jul 19 16:48:01 2015 UTC,Good write up and I agree with the list with the exception of Sarao. I'd have Kevon Seymour somewhere in there.
CFB,3dtyqh,dead_cats_everywhere,7,Sun Jul 19 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot. I'll try to rank these in order of people that have proved themselves the most and would be the biggest detriment to lose. Any other GT fans, feel free to critique as I made this up rather quickly.  1. Justin Thomas (JR QB). Already proven to be an incredible QB for our system, he won MVP for the Orange Bowl last year. Possibly the fastest QB in college football and he's got a quick release on his throws as well. Somewhat short, but it works to his advantage as it makes him harder to tackle and gives him better body control. Youngest player to be named a captain, his attitude and demeanor has been great for improving team chemistry and that cannot be understated.  2. Jabari Hunt-Days (SR DT). I am kind of breaking my ""proven themselves"" rule here, but this is a player I am very excited about. Projected 2 years ago as being the #1 LB in the 2016 draft off of potential, he was ruled academically ineligible last year. Instead of bolting, he stuck around and improved his strength and weight on the scout team to the point where he's now near 300 lbs, but retained most of his speed. CPJ made a comment a few days ago saying he's confident he'll regain his eligibility this Fall and all players on our team have called him a ""monster"" and started #FearJabari2015. Shaq Mason, our All-American guard who went in the draft last year, said JHD was the best DT he played against all year. And we played a lot of great DTs.  3. Adam Gotsis (SR DT). Australian player who was sent to us by a former player of CPJ who now coaches football in Australia. Probably will play SDE in the NFL, but he's been the starting DT for us the last two years and he's played all three. Very strong and smart player, he's been one of our most covered players this offseason. Very well-spoken guy.  4. DJ White (SR CB). Someone who seems to get overlooked a lot. He was one of our biggest playmakers last year; he caught the interception to seal the Georgia game and he ran down James Conner over like 60 yards to strip the ball at the 1 yard line. As a senior, I fully expect him to have an incredible year and be taken up in the draft.  5. Keshun Freeman (SO DE). Freshman All-American, he came in because we had absolutely no depth on the DL this last season. Playing at a size way below where he should, he still lead the team in sacks. Now he's got 30 lbs more and should be an even bigger force going forward. Youngest player on the list, but he's definitely earned the hype.  6. PJ Davis (JR LB). Lead our team in tackles last year, he's really a fan favorite. He's a short linebacker who most overlooked in the recruiting process and who we picked up on signing day. Turns out he gives more effort than anybody. He hits like a freight train and was given the nickname ""Tasmanian Devil"" by previously mentioned Aussie, Adam Gotsis. Vic Alexander, a highly recruited player from the 2015 class, specifically mentioned how he wanted to play with PJ because they are similar sizes/styles. He's supposedly taken on more of a leadership role going into this junior year and is playing more in the framework of the defense. He should continue being stellar.  7. Freddie Burden (JR C). Our offensive line is arguably our deepest and most talented unit on the team (ranked 2nd in allowed sacks), so limiting my picks to two was difficult. Burden was a large part that we were able to do on the OL last year and I believe he has been placed on a watchlist for the best center in the nation.  8. Jamal Golden (SR S). A leader on defense, he should have a great season at safety next year. He lead the team with four interceptions and should improve on that going into the next season. He's also an incredible punt returner and has been nominated for the award for most versatile athlete as a result.  9. Broderick Snoddy (SR RB, A-Back). Definitely one of the fastest players in the nation, he's returning from an injury where he whipped his own leg and snapped it during the Clemson game. He is our only returning A-Back and he will need to step up as a leader. He was just starting to break out last year before his injury, so we all hope he can pick up where he left off.  10. Trey Braun (SR G). A guard who has been playing for our team for years. He recently graduated with his degree in mechanical engineering and is returning for grad school. He has a ton of experience and will surely be one of our leaders on the OL and offense as a whole.  In summary, our DL and OL should be fantastic next year. We have very little experience at WR, A-Back, and B-Back, so I left them off of the list. Though the latter two are very much plug-and-play positions, so with the OL I am not worried. Our secondary is full of seniors and guys who could play in the NFL. And then there's Justin Thomas."
CFB,3dtyqh,dahlkomy,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'd put Hunt-Days in his own category - maybe an asterisk after the list, just because he's a question mark in a lot of ways this year.  He was a terror at LB, then was expected to be a terror at DE, got suspended, then changed positions again.  Usually that isn't a terribly good recipe for success, but the reviews coming out of the program from players and coaches alike have been overwhelmingly positive.  From an expectations standpoint he's certainly up there with Gotsis, but for a top 10 players list I'd put Errin Joe at 10, and give Hunt-Days an asterisk."
CFB,3dtyqh,dead_cats_everywhere,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. I was giving JHD some much credit because he's been so motivated to get back on the field. Assuming he's eligible, as soon as he gets the chance he's going to start being a terror in the opponents' backfield. Also, Errin Joe is a good addition, I was struggling with who to put on the list from the OL. I want someone like Shamire Devine from a pure potential standpoint, but he hasn't exactly shown the drive to get on the field yet. I'd give Gary Brown a better shot at seeing PT over Shamire."
CFB,3dtyqh,MookBerryMuffin,8,Sun Jul 19 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"California:   Jared Goff - QB, JR. AKA: Based Goff, Bear Raid Commander, The Messiah Who Will Lead Us to the Holy Land of Roses: Potentially the first quarterback picked in the draft. Goff has a good arm, fantastic feet in the pocket, incredible touch and makes good decisions. Had 35 TD's to 7 INT's. Of those 7 INT's, 4 were tipped passes. Improved drastically from his freshman year to sophomore year, apparently went ""from great to elite"" over spring, according to Sonny Dykes. Gets knocked sometimes for playing in a spread/non-prostyle offense, but makes NFL reads and throws daily. See: Arizona game against a 3-3-5 defense, designed to stop the spread offense.  Exhibit A: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11561751  Exhibit B: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11562460 Kenny Lawler - WR, JR. The wide receiver corps is the Golden Bears' deepest and most talented unit. Kenny Lawler is number 2 on this list because he has ridiculously massive hands and makes amazing catches, which makes him Goff's favorite target.  Exhibit A: http://www.gfycat.com/RealWeightyAustraliankelpie  Exhibit B: http://www.gfycat.com/PlaintiveWellinformedGalapagostortoise Bryce Treggs - WR, SR. One of the team leaders; bleeds blue and gold. He has burners. Moved from outside to inside receiver last season. Another one of Goff's favorite targets.  Exhibit A: See Goff's Exhibit B.  Exhibit B: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11645796 Daniel Lasco - RB, SR. One of the oldest members on the team, was a freshman when CJ Anderson was a senior. He says he tries to model his game off of CJ's, and it's starting to show. Incredibly physical back who is also very quick. Ran for 1115 yards last season.  Exhibit A: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11600423  Exhibit B: http://www.gfycat.com/EveryImprobableIndianpangolin       http://www.gfycat.com/ThickDishonestAmmonite Stephen Anderson - WR, SR. Former walk-on wide receiver who turned into one of the best wide receivers on the team. A go-to guy on third down. One of the toughest guys to tackle on the team.  Exhibit A: http://www.gfycat.com/MetallicOrganicCorydorascatfish  Exhibit B: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11807881 Trevor Davis - WR & KR, SR. Transferred from Hawaii in 2013 and redshirted. His first year playing at Cal was fantastic. One of the fastest guys on the team. Big deep threat and a dynamic kickoff returner.  Exhibit A: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11645532  Exhibit B: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11644472 Chris Borrayo - LG, JR. Borrayo and Rigsbee (also a guard) are the best offensive linemen on the team. I'm putting Borrayo here because he has the bigger upside of the two. He played the 2013 season as a true freshman and emerged as one of the team leaders. A true OG.  (Sorry Chris, not an expert on OL, therefore no exhibits) Devante Downs - LB, SO. Notice how the top 7 players (and likely more, I just wanted to showcase a few potential playmakers on defense) are on the offensive side of the ball? That'll tell you how lopsided our team was last year. However, there are signs of development on the defense. The linebacker squad is probably the second-deepest unit on the team. Devante Downs played as a true freshman last season and showed flashes of playmaking ability. I think he'll emerge as a star in 2015.  Exhibit A: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11873219  Exhibit B: He had an interception against BYU, but I can't find it. Mustafa Jalil - DT, SR. Another guy who has been on the team for ages. He's been banged up for the better part of 3 years, but when he's healthy he's a helluva load. Our pass rush was abysmal last year, so hopefully this year he'll get some help.  Exhibit A: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11562535  Exhibit B: http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:11437737 Darius White - CB, SR. Our secondary was the worst in FBS history last year. No, really. Much of this was due to a nonexistent pass rush, but the secondary nonetheless failed miserably to keep up with the passing powerhouses of the Pac. Darius White started last year as a JuCo transfer. He struggled initially but showed serious signs of improvement towards the end of the year. He apparently locked up the unlockable K-Law this entire spring.  (No exhibits here either. Had a pick against a Hogan, but I can't find it. Offenses   didn't really look his way towards the last couple of games.)  Honorable mentions: Vic Enwere (huge bulldozer RB), James Looney (powerful DT transfer from Wake who redshirted last year, coaches super excited about him), Griffin Piatt (three picks last year in three games, then tore his ACL), Caleb Coleman (two picks last year, emerging as a great nickelback. The reason why we beat Oregon State), all LB's and WR's (again, deepest positions on the team).   TL;DR: Based Goff, Goffense very good; Defense very bad. Goffense will be prolific; defense has potential (maybe). ROSE BOWL PLS  I also didn't proofread this, so lemme know if it's completely incoherent."
CFB,3dtyqh,MookBerryMuffin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:23:49 2015 UTC,I played in HS with Jared. Very good leader and incredibly humble. He is by far the best player we have had go through our school.
CFB,3dtyqh,pinwheelpride,6,Sun Jul 19 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"Cam Robinson LT- just another player in Alabama's long line of dominant o-line men, probably the most NFL-ready freshman last year, with another year of experience expect for him to be even better. Derrick Henry RB- He burst onto the scene in his sugar bowl performance against Oklahoma and followed it up with nearly 1000 yards last season, he was second in yard but first in ypc. I expect him to be the focal point of the offense this year. A heavy hitting runner with the ability to breakthrough the defense. Reggie Ragland LB- the quarterback for the defense, he was second in tackles with 86, 8.5 going for a loss, and at his size of 6'2"" 260 lbs he's like a dlineman playing linebacker JK Scott P- number 1 in the nation in net yard average per punt, IMO easily the best punter in the nation not much else to say. A'Shawn Robinson DL- the centerpiece of our deepest position group, he's better than his stats show as he only had 47 tackles, being a disruptive force in the middle. Kenyan Drake RB/WR- Coming off a leg break against Ole Miss last year, the fastest member of the offense, Lane Kiffin has admitted how excited he is to get to use this man, the man with breakaway speed will be the 2nd feature back behind Henry, the x-factor of the offense. Reuben Foster LB- the hardest hitting member of the team, needs to fix his tackling as he likes to lead with his head, but one of the most explosive players on D needs to step up if Alabama wants to have a lot of success this year, OJ Howard TE- A player with all the tools to be the best TE in cfb has another year to put it all together, I expect him to be the safety blanket for whoever our qb is, had 17 catches for 260 yards but I think all but 2 were for a first down Cyrus Jones CB- Cyrus had 3 interceptions and 45 tackles last year, he needs to improve his coverage skills to help the secondary, and SO Tony Brown and RS-FR Marlon Humphrey should help him not be isolated Chris Black WR- Amari Cooper-lite had 15 catches for 188 yards, showcasing his big play ability, look for him to step up in the absence of Cooper and Deandrew White."
CFB,3dtyqh,tdoger,3,Sun Jul 19 15:32:06 2015 UTC,Ugh.  Alabama was one team I was curious about.  Now I'm reminded you guys are still loaded.
CFB,3dtyqh,bizzyj93,7,Sun Jul 19 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Devontae Booker, RB, Senior: Heisman trophy candidate, often referred to as Baby Marshawn (Lynch). Hard nosed runner with decent cutting ability and phenomenal hands for a running back. First team All-PAC-12 last season, averaged 116 ypg even though he didn't start until fourth game of the season. Tevin Carter, SS, Senior: Only played in four games last season but had two interceptions, 16 tackles, and 3.5 tackles for loss. Will have major impact if he can stay healthy. Potential All-Conference player, and 1st-2nd round draft pick. Hunter Dimick, DE, Junior: Finished 9th in the nation in sacks last season even though he missed final two games due to injury. All-PAC-12 candidate. Tom Hackett, P, Senior: Yes, that's right, a punter at #4. Hackett won the Ray Guy award last year, and had as much impact on the outcome of our wins as any other player on the team. His booming power combined with pinpoint precision makes him a dangerous weapon, and his laid back Australian demeanor makes him a hoot to watch. Siasosi Aiono, C, Senior: Aiono anchors a stout offensive line that contributed greatly to Booker's success last season. Rimington Trophy candidate has allowed just one sack in 747 regular season plays. Jarred Norris, LB, Senior: Led Utah with 8.9 tackles per game. Smart, relentless leader who is vital to our success this season. Kylie Fitts, DE, Junior: Initially a four star recruit who transferred from UCLA and sat out last season per NCAA rules. Shined during spring ball, and looks to take over where Nate Orchard left off. Travis Wilson/Kendal Thompson, QB, Senior: I'm still not sure who will start at QB, but I think either guy has a chance to have a good season. We finally have some stability with our play calling, and with teams focusing on Devontae Booker there is no excuse for our passing game flailing like last season. I'm cautiously optimistic that one of these guys will turn a corner this year. Kenneth Scott, WR, Senior: By far the most underutilized talent on our team last season. Relegated to short out routes on third and fourth down even though he showed the ability to make big plays in prior seasons. New OC plans on taking off the handcuffs, and letting the big guy shine. Scott is a potential NFL talent who is poised for a big year. Gionni Paul, LB, Senior: Transfer from Miami started seven games last season prior to going down with injury. Had four interceptions, and three tackles for loss. Has the potential to be a star if he can stay healthy."
CFB,3dtyqh,USC_TrojanMan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"You need Gionni higher, imo. I think he's going to play a big role."
CFB,3dtyqh,pinwheelpride,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"I was super excited about Gionni last year, and still think he might be one of our best players, but his history of injuries concerns me. I could probably drop Carter a few slots based on that line of thought too. I think Fitts has the potential to jump into the top 3. Can't wait for the season to start already."
CFB,3dtyqh,matchles,20,Sun Jul 19 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"Royce Freeman - RB (So) 'Rolls' Royce Freeman is one of the best RBs in the country and will be the main attack of our offense this year. If he lives up to his capabilities all season he should be in the Heisman discussion. DeForest Buckner - DL (Sr) 'DeFo' is our best defensive player and a leader for the team. He is a better D-Linemen than Arik Armstead who was taken 17th overall this past draft. Vernon Adams (Sr)/ Jeff Lockie (Jr) - QB Whoever wins this battle is capable of leading this team to a great season. Adams has shown more explosive play with deep passes and good elusiveness. And what we've seen from Lockie is good accuracy and efficiency, with a decent running ability. Thomas Tyner - RB (Jr) The faster of the two main RBs, Tyner is absolutely no slouch and can make some fantastic plays. He will still get a lot of carries this year. Braylon Addison - WR (RJr) Addison was injured all last year and didn't play, but is poised for a huge return this year. He is our best receiver and will likely see some action as a throwing WR during some trick plays. Charles Nelson - WR/DB (So) Nelson is a stud and will play both sides of the ball this year. He absolutely demolished in our spring game in both positions. Byron Marshall - WR/RB (Sr) Marshall is a WR converted from an RB but is still a fantastic receiver and I believe led the team in receiving yards last year. Matt Hegarty - C (Sr) This guy is a transfer from ND so I don't know much about him, but if he starts at Center, it will fill a massive hole left by Hroniss Grasu. Currently there is no named starter at Center, so if he can start it will be a huge relief. Devon Allen - WR (RSo) Allen had a knee injury in the Rose Bowl, so I don't know when he will be back, but if he does play this season, he should be the number two target for Lockie/Adams. One of the fastest guys in football. Aidan Schneider - K (So) I really didn't know who else to put here in the last spot, but I thought Schneider fit the bill because he is the best kicker we've had for a long time, and I for one, am ecstatic to have a reliable kicker who won't cost us huge games. (I'm looking at you Maldonado.)"
CFB,3dtyqh,jrb52don,6,Sun Jul 19 13:46:56 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the thorough write-up.  FYI, Hegarty's no superstar, but he's a legit NFL prospect.  I'm curious if you're just favoring offensive skill position talent here, or if you would say it's true only 1.5 of your Top 10 players play defense."
CFB,3dtyqh,ryanthenarwhal,8,Sun Jul 19 13:54:43 2015 UTC,"We're definitely offense heavy, and a lot of the bigger names on defense are unproven freshmen, like Canton Kaumatule and Ugo Amadi. These guys could easily be superstars, but I wouldn't put them on this list until I see them play against some real competition first."
CFB,3dtyqh,CompletelyProtocol,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with your top 7 players, but I'm unsure about putting Hegarty, Allen and Schneider in there ahead of guys like Johnstone, Crosby, Seisay and Hardrick. I know TJ has been hurt but he's an All-American type player if healthy, Crosby had an incredible true freshman season, and I simply think Seisay and Hardrick make too much of a difference, even if they aren't standouts, to be ahead of guys that didn't play a TON.  And as much as i like Devon Allen, all 7 of his TDs came in a four-week stretch early in the season. It'll be interesting, though. The number of weapons is insane, but I think the defense will surprise a bit."

CFB,3dtyqh,mikeegle30,3,Sun Jul 19 14:45:25 2015 UTC,Is Royce Freeman the typical speedy/shifty Oregon back? Or is he a bigger power runner?  Either way that's a great nickname  Edit: two more questions. Is he expected to start ahead of Tyner? And did he play a lot last year? I didn't keep track of y'all as much since we didn't play last year so I'm trying to get caught up on y'all this season.
CFB,3dtyqh,GelvinMordon,3,Sun Jul 19 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Freeman is the exact opposite of a typical Oregon back. 6'0, 230 pound bruiser with decent speed in the open field. Not quite breakaway, but when he gets rolling he's pretty fast. Think he's somewhere around a 4.5 40. Breaks tackles on nearly every play, super tough to bring down. Good hands.  He started ahead of Tyner in the 3rd or 4th week of the season and didn't give up the spot the rest of the way. He ended up with 1,365 yards and 18 touchdowns, nearly doubling Tyner's rushing yardage record for a true freshman from the previous season. He slowed a bit in the playoff, but I expect him to pile up some big yards early this season. For my money, he belongs in the discussion with the other top power backs, or maybe just a hair behind. He'll start this year and Tyner will play a ton, my hope is a 60-40 split."
CFB,3dtyqh,Jeric_B,2,Sun Jul 19 18:06:24 2015 UTC,Freeman is a power runner in the vein of LeGarrette Blount and Johnathan Stewart. He's quick and can break away but isn't afraid to hit and get hit. He started most of last year and should again start ahead of Tyner.  This should catch you up on him.    It should be a fun game this year.
CFB,3dtyqh,ComfortablyNumbLoL,3,Mon Jul 20 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part on all these. Couple thoughts:   No Tyler Johnstone (LT, RS-Sr)? Dude can play, and his leadership will be huge on this year's O-Line. No Joe Walker (ILB, Sr)? Love Schneider, but Walker returns as one of the most experienced guys on D. Had 80 tackles --plus the game-changing TD at Utah-- and our coaches love his football IQ. I think he could be an honorable mention Pac-12 kind of player this season."

Dynamic with his feet, getting better with his accuracy. As long as he doesn't take a step back from his first full year as a QB he will do great. Good team leader as well.   Josh Doctson - WR, sr - athletic freak. One handed full leaping balls were the norm. Just type his name into YouTube. More of the ""body"" than speed.   Ranthony Texada - CB, so - returning from first year as a full time starter. Played opposite a lock down guy last year and needs to be that guy this year.   Aaron Green - RB, sr - athlete. A bit skinny but very good on the open field cut. Wasn't a full time starter until halfway through the season and lit it up.   Halapoulivaati Vaitai ""Big V"" - OT, sr - anchors the outside a good line with 3 years of consistent experience. Big body, good on pass protection and surprisingly athletic.   Daivion Pierson - DT, sr - was helped by his counterpart Chucky Hunter who was double teamed a bit last year. Our LBs are extremely inexperienced and need help from our DTs to keep the OL held up. Should be in for a good year doing that even if his production is low.   Joey Hunt - C, sr - same as Big V. An experienced line is the key to a good offense imho. He's been the starter for years now, gets down field on running plays and makes the protection calls quickly enough to facilitate our HUNH offense.   Kolby Listenbee - WR, sr - fastest 100M college football player in the country. Didn't connect a few deep balls last year by he is a track star. If they improve that, he is a constant threat for a 60+ yard touchdown.   Derrick Kindred - S, sr - only returning safety in a defense where that is the QB on the field. Showed good signs last year, should continue to do. Patterson is generally a very good safety developer.   Kenny Hill - scout team QB, jr - seriously. Our defense is going to practice against one of the most athletic and experienced scout team QBs in the country. As long as his presence isn't a team vibe detriment, I think this will give us a tremendous advantage.   Others- Josh Carraway (de), Cameron Echols-Luper (returner,wr), Kenny Iloka (s), deante gray (wr)  Our defense is not at all experienced but Gary Patterson will have them up to speed. By the end of the season 3-4 guys will emerge into this list from that side of the ball. Also, our kicker Jaden Oberkrom can be a big difference maker. He's pretty good."

He's no Melvin Gordon, but he's a Wisconsin runningback, and he could be a beast next year. Michael Caputo: Caputo reminds me a little bit of Chris Borland. Really good instincts, and a very good tackler. Sojourn Shelton: He's small for a CB, so not a huge NFL prospect. But he is very solid in coverage. Now he has another year of experience, so he could be better this year. Alex Erickson: We rarely throw the ball, but if we ever do, it's probably to him. He's not super fast, but he has good hands and runs routes well. His size is solid, making him a deep-pass threat. Dare Ogunbowale: People forget about him quite often, he's relatively the same size as Clement, but not quite as strong. He has a lot of good moves, and is a downhill runner. I'd like to see some jet sweep with him and Clement it'd be good Tanner McEvoy: No longer at QB, and now back at safety (and rumor has it they might try him at WR). He is a very good athlete; fast, strong, the whole package. He is back where he was originally playing, and could be effective Darius Hillary: Playing opposite of Shelton, and has a similar problem, small. He is quick and can keep up with any receiver, but his size is still a major issue. Troy Fumagali: Good size for TE, just not sure about his speed. He is a smart player and can make big plays. He's our number two receiving threat. Vince Biegel: I realize I may have put him a little far down on the list, but he could have another solid season. He's an OLB with good size and can tackle well when needed. Rob Wheelwright: I'm reluctant to put him on here, as he wasn't used much last season. He's got good hands, and is a good athlete, yet not a great athlete. I think he could definitely get the job done if he gets to play more this season"

Chikwe Obasih - DE who I feel could have a breakout year and be the star of the D-Line"
CFB,3dtyqh,bzhbuck,6,Sun Jul 19 18:49:42 2015 UTC,"Nelson Spruce - SR WR: An excellent possession receiver with the athleticism to make big plays at times.  I always say he's perfected all the little things that make him a great WR.  Last season: 106 rec/1198 yds/12 TD  Tedric Thompson - JR S: Some other Buff fans might have him a bit lower, mostly for injury concerns.  But this guy is an absolute stud when he's healthy, and when he was out it was so obvious how much he was missed.  He had our only 3 INTs in just ~7 games.  Chidobe Awuzie JR DB:  Awuzie can play anywhere in the secondary and is incredibly consistent.  From rushing the QB to man to man, he can do it all.  Addison Gillam JR LB:  Health and concussion issues ruined Gillam's SO year after being a freshman All-American.  He went down to the weight of the average WR, word is he's back up to ~220 and should be 230 by the opener.  If healthy and back to form, this defense will improve a ton, but if not, Leavitt might have the hardest job in CFB.  Stephane Nembot SR RT:  All of 6'7 325, Nembot is an absolute beast of a man.  Coming from Cameroon, he had played little football when he came here, now the light seem to turn on for him mid last year and he could be a early round draft pick with another year of improvement.  Kenneth Crawley SR CB:  Crawley came in as a 4* and was thrown into the fire.  Whether he got burned, I don't know, but he's stuck it through and improved consistently and now is his time.  His improvement hasn't quite shown up in the stat sheet but I get a feeling he'll have a big SR year.  Samson Kafovalu JR DL:  He smashed through a brick wall Kool-aid man style once.  He also showed some really impressive play before having to miss last season for academic/personal reasons.  Sefo Liufau JR QB:  I am both Sefo's biggest critic and his biggest defender.  He'll break every QB record here but will he do it while winning?  He shows signs and has endless potential, but some of his mechanics just haven't shown improvement and give concern to whether he can become a better passer.  He's a good QB and he had a not so good team around him, I just know he's capable of becoming a great QB and I want to see that happen.  Last season: 3200 yards/28 TDs/15 INTs  Jeromy Irwin JR LT:  Graded out as the 2nd best OL last season and gave up just 3 sacks.  Shay Fields SO WR:  Broke the FR reception record at 50 catches.  Dangerous in the open field, but both he and the OC need to get him there.  A lot of potential and a hard worker, could breakout this year.  Last season: 50 rec/486 yds/4 TDs   HM:  NT Josh Tupou would have been #2 if not for our student disciplinary committee who thinks they know more than the law.  Also OLB Derek McCartney and C Alex Kelley were noteworthy considerations."

Just a couple hundred yards and a bare field goal per game over either Miller or Jones. Ezekiel Elliott -- RB -- If you don't live in B1G country, you might not have heard much about EZ-E until the post season, but now he's a household name and a Heisman front-runner. The main argument against him being able to win the coveted trophy is three-fold: He's not a QB, it'll be damn near impossible to top what he's already done, and OSU is so loaded at talent spots, there just won't be enough touches to go around. Michael Thomas -- WR -- While most of the attention went to Devin Smith among the receiving corps because of his unrivaled nose for the ball deep, Michael Thomas actually lead the team in catches last year. He shows an incredible amount of body control and balance. Taylor Decker -- LT -- This beefy left tackle has already stepped up into a leadership role on the line. He was the only returning starter last year, and he was instrumental in helping the slobs up front gel as a group after the disaster against Virginia Tech. Now with four returning starters, the OL looks set to keep their momentum going. Curtis Samuel -- RB -- If you aren't a Buckeye fan, you may not have heard much about Curtis Samuel. He started to get more touches toward the end of the season, but that was right when Ezekiel Elliott went beast mode. Still, from everything the coaching staff has been saying in the off season, he is top level talent that will be getting 40-50 plays per game instead of the ten he averaged last year.   Honorable Mention: Dontre Wilson (HB), Jalin Marshall (HB), Nick Vannett (TE)  Defense   Joey Bosa -- DE -- There might not be another player in the country on the defensive side of the ball who has received as much hype as Joey Bosa. He finished half a sack shy of OSU's single season sack record as a sophomore (13.5) and was constantly in the backfield racking up TFL. Towards the end of the year, his numbers took a dip because of the double-teams he drew, but he will be an invaluable player in the upcoming year. Darron Lee -- LB -- A former high school quarterback, Lee had to struggle for attention at OSU camps, but eventually he earned an offer. He switched positions and became an immediate force to be reckoned with. He has an incredible nose for the ball and an amazing ability to get off of blocks. He finished third on the team in tackles (81), and oh yeah, he's only a sophomore. Eli Apple -- CB -- He's moved up to the number one CB spot on the team after Grant graduated, but he's shown that he's more than up to the task. He is a true lockdown corner that is able to stick with anyone on the field. Adolphus Washington -- DT -- Moving up to take Bennett's spot means he has some big shoes to fill, but Washington is a big man. If he plays to his potential, the DL will be wreaking havoc all year long. Raekwon McMillan -- LB -- A highly touted 5-star prospect out of Georgia split playing time with the senior MLB at Ohio State in 14 of 15 games as a true freshman last year. Now that's saying something. Even with his limited snaps (though he saw more than the starter Grant in 9 games), he still finished with 54 tackles (6.5 TFL) on the year. He has the potential to be an All-American now that he's got the starting job all to himself.   Honorable Mention: Vonn Bell (SS), Joshua Perry (LB)"
CFB,3dtyqh,GotHimCoach,7,Sun Jul 19 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see where you actually rank them together.    Joey Bosa Quarterback Eze Taylor Decker  Darron Lee  Vonn Bell Michael Thomas  Adolphus Washington Eli Apple Joshua Perry / Maybe Pat Eflein if you want to go with an offensive guy here instead of D.    I think it's just too early for Jalin Marshall, Samuel, McMillan.. but I probably imagine all 3 have great chances to bump people from this list as the season progresses.  Additionally, Conley and Tyquan Lewis. We're just stacked with young guys"
CFB,3dtyqh,GotHimCoach,6,Sun Jul 19 16:20:58 2015 UTC,Bell goes above both Apple and McMillan.  Bell led the team in interceptions with 6 and was second on the team in tackles.  He had a really good season.  Apple did as well but not quite as good.  McMillan is still predominantly hype.
CFB,3dtyqh,cms186,16,Sun Jul 19 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Vonn Bell is much better than Eli Apple and Joshua Perry is better than Raekwon McMillan. Raekwon hasn't started a game and Joshua is a senior captain and 3 year starter.  Other than that, i like the list."
CFB,3dtyqh,gir6543,7,Sun Jul 19 15:44:15 2015 UTC,I hope Dontre can put together a nice season this year. He has so much potential to be used in a variety of ways (a very poor man's Reggie Bush imo) but injuries and a stacked depth chart have kept him down. He could be a real X-factor if healthy.
CFB,3dtyqh,cms186,4,Sun Jul 19 15:43:40 2015 UTC,He's got to learn how to field punt returns though
CFB,3dtyqh,gir6543,6,Sun Jul 19 16:36:57 2015 UTC,I doubt they'll have him doing punts after Jalin proved to be pretty good at it
CFB,3dtyqh,cms186,6,Sun Jul 19 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Jalin is great but he is going to give me a heart attack with how reckless he is fielding the ball.  Him fumbling a punt in the spring game didn't help either.
CFB,3dtyqh,GotHimCoach,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:41 2015 UTC,I like the list. Another honorable mention in my opinion is Corey Smith. Losing Devin Smith and Evan Spencer means more significant snaps for Corey Smith. He played well last season in a pretty limited role and made a few big plays on special teams. He'll need to have a solid year if the Buckeyes want to try to repeat as national champions in my opinion.
CFB,3dtyqh,Malfate,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely include Cameron Johnston at the very least in the ""Honorable Mention"" section. I don't really expect a large number of punts this year, but he's consistently underrated by most fans."
CFB,3dtyqh,cms186,16,Sun Jul 19 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll try to do a top 10 for Baylor  1.Spencer Drango, left tackle All-American and could've easily gone first round last year but decided to stay for his senior year. The lynchpin in a criminally underrated O-line.  2.Shawn Oakman, 6'8"" 280 lbs defensive end. The man, the myth, the legend. If he gains the consistency from play to play he has been lacking, he will be a threat to any offensive line.  3.Corey Coleman, WR returning off a 1000+ yard receiving year, Coleman is a deep threat and if healthy could easily be the top receiver in the nation.  4.Andrew Billings, NT junior who holds the Texas record for squats, will be key for defensive run support.  5.KD Cannon, sophomore WR, also coming off a 1000+ yard receiving year. Another huge deep threat and still developing.  6.Seth Russel, QB coming into his first year starting, he has all the tools to be great, big arm and incredibly athletic, hopefully can pick up where Petty left off  7.Taylor Young, OLB sophomore, with another year of off season under his belt, he will start to be a name people hear more and more, while he is small he is a dynamic blitzer.  8.Shock Linwood, RB had a decline in his sophomore year, but we expect him to pick it up this year.   9.Blake Muir, Guard, a huge reason why Baylor puts up under rated rushing numbers. He makes holes that a compact truck could fit through.   My dark horse pick, Laquan McGowan. The 480 pound TE. Go look up his TD against MSU and you will see the scary capabilities"
CFB,3dtyqh,postposter,7,Sun Jul 19 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"This is what I like.  I basically just knew about Oakman.  Scary to think he might not even be your best player.  Others can look up the McGowan TD, but I remember.  Things were looking awfully bleak for MSU at that point."
CFB,3dtyqh,GotHimCoach,4,Sun Jul 19 14:02:12 2015 UTC,"Oakman could be our best player, but right now I would lean toward Drango because he has proven he is a top player while Oakman still has loads of untapped potential"
CFB,3dtyqh,dseals,9,Sun Jul 19 14:07:07 2015 UTC,"Billings is better than Oakman, Oakman gets the hype, Billings gets the double teams, my ranking would be:  1: Spencer Drango, LT, SR  2: Andrew Billings, DT, JR  3: Corey Coleman, WR, JR  4: Shaun Oakman, DE, SR  5: Shock Linwood, RB, JR  6: Xavien Howard, CB, JR - Closest thing we have to a shutdown corner  7: Seth Russell, QB, JR  8: Taylor Young, OLB, SO  9: KD Cannon, WR, SO  10: Orion Stewart, SS, JR - won all Big 12 honours last season, excellent in coverage, big part of our Defence  and the best thing? theres only 2 seniors on that list! ( though its considered a decent possiblity of Coleman and/or Billings leaving early for the draft )"
CFB,3dtyqh,dseals,3,Sun Jul 19 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Better list. I keep waiting for orion to turn into Dixon. I think he will, he definitely has the attitude and ability"
CFB,3dtyqh,No_Way_Pablo,4,Sun Jul 19 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Orion and Ahmad are complete opposites though, thats not going to happen, Dixon was a superb Run-Support safety with questionable ( and thats being generous ) Coverage skills, whilst Stewart is vastly superior in coverage and doesnt get as involved with blitzing and that part of the game, that could be because the D-Line is much better now and hes not being asked to do that, or it could just be a happy coincidence"
CFB,3dtyqh,racerbeaz,3,Sun Jul 19 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Oh I just meant as an emotional leader. Good breakdown of their styles though
CFB,3dtyqh,nuxenolith,2,Sun Jul 19 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"Oh i see, im not really sure if we have that type of player in the secondary, not vocally so anyway"
CFB,3dtyqh,Beerandbruins,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:08 2015 UTC,I was gonna have Xavien in there but I wanted to add Laquan. I think Orion can be great but he still has some growing to do and I don't know if he will be the emotional leader Ahmad was
CFB,3dtyqh,seventhpoet,4,Sun Jul 19 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"https://vine.co/v/Ow6BlwT3X6Z  I can't believe you didnt post shawn oakman kissing drango when he decided to stay. The kiss the sealed the jubilation for every baylor fan for 2015, baylor's two best lineman coming back!"
CFB,3dtyqh,bosstone42,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"not that it makes a great deal of difference, but McGowan is around 400lbs, not 480!, still huge of course!"

CFB,3dtyqh,bosstone42,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"I only use mobile and don't know who to message for flair. I rarely comment so I never bothered asking, but I am a Baylor fan through and through"
CFB,3dtyqh,8footpenguin,9,Sun Jul 19 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"1) Le'Raven Clark   First round prospect for the upcoming draft. One of the best LTs in CFB right now. Absolute rock on our line for the past 3 years. Easily the most important part of our offense.   2) DeAndre Washington   First 1,000 yard rusher since 1998. 2nd in the Big 12 for rushing average at 5.9 yards per carry. Major threat in the run and passing game. Is criminally underrated as a running back and should be making some waves with NFL scouts this season.   3) Pete Robertson   Lead the Big 12 in sacks last season and is making a switch to 4-3 linebacker from his 3-4 OLB position. Should be good to have his tackling all over the field instead of just exclusively in the backfield.   4) Patrick Mahomes   The QB I would predict to win the starting QB competition. Mobile, good arm, and just a sophomore. Should show some good strides as a player this season. Opens up the playbook big time for us.   5) Breiden Fehoko   No guarantee he actually plays this year instead of redshirting, but considering our line play last season and our switch to the 4-3, Fehoko should play a major role on the defensive line. He's a very highly touted freshman and should get some significant playing time.   6) Tevin Madison   Probably the best part of our abysmal pass defense last season. Madison should be making some good strides in his sophomore season as the starting corner. He's a good tackler and a tough guy to beat in one-on-one coverage. As long as he's on the field our pass defense shouldn't be the worst in the country.   7) Jared Kaster   Another one of our senior offensive linemen. Kaster will be the starting center for his third season this year. Much like Clark, he'll be expected to be a senior leader on the offense.   8) Jakeem Grant   While he wasn't as explosive last season as he has been in the past, Grant is still a dangerous offensive weapon. Only 5'6"" but quick as hell, Grant is another senior that most people expect to step up and perform this season.   9) Devin Lauderdale   A junior and JUCO transfer, Lauderdale is fucking fast. He has the most yards per catch on the team and was a great deep threat to compliment Marquez and Grant's short game threat last year. Lauderdale should be the starting WR opposite Grant and should be the target of most of our deep throws.   10) Justin Stockton   Tough call on who should be #10, but Justin Stockton wins it for me. He has 4.3 speed coming out of the backfield and was a good change of pace back when paired with DeAndre. Where DeAndre is a shifty runner who will get you first downs, Stockton is a big play threat that could break off a touchdown run on any given play."
CFB,3dtyqh,OneBadassTurtle,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"Great info, but I'm noticing once you get past the top three you're talking about some guys who haven't even solidified starting roles.  What kind of record are you anticipating?"
CFB,3dtyqh,captain_sasquatch,5,Sun Jul 19 14:25:52 2015 UTC,Between 4-8 and 6-6.
CFB,3dtyqh,clockworkblk,5,Sun Jul 19 14:48:11 2015 UTC,I admire realism from CFB fans.
CFB,3dtyqh,Try_to,2,Sun Jul 19 15:46:32 2015 UTC,How do you expect the defense to be this year? Any news on if the new DC is doing well\the players adjusting to a new scheme well?
CFB,3dtyqh,mrjonnyjazz,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, with our O-line being as good as it is this year, I would've switched Stockton out with Alfredo Morales. He was a solid guard for us the past couple of years, and was a key part in last year's line that didn't allow a sack until the Oklahoma State game."
CFB,3dtyqh,Poppeseed,4,Sun Jul 19 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"Michigan State      Jack Conklin, LT — A former grayshirt who has only allowed 2.5 sacks in 27 career games, Conklin is one of the guys you never notice, because he always does his job.  Neutralized Ohio State's star DEs in 2013 B1GCG.  Probably our best NFL prospect. Connor Cook, QB — Makes head-scratchingly poor decisions at times, but is the most clutch QB I've seen at Michigan State.  23–3 record as a starter, 16–1 against B1G opponents.  Cook is an experienced leader who will need to step up after losing his two favorite targets from least season, Tony Lippett and Keith Mumphery. Shilique Calhoun, WDE — Excellent edge rush threat, numbers should bounce back in 2015 on a DL that starts four seniors.  (Calhoun is a physical specimen and tends to draw double teams, but DL will be MSU's strongest unit next season, and opponents will soon find that to no longer be a viable strategy.) Lawrence Thomas, SDE — Former 5* LB, started last season at 3-tech, but will primarily play outside his senior year at power end, Marcus Rush's old position.  However, I wouldn't be surprised to see him play inside on 3rd-and-longs.  An incredibly versatile athlete, he'll leave Michigan State having played 3 positions (FB, SDE, DT) in his time here. Jack Allen, C — One of three brothers to play at MSU (including 2016 Matthew), the 6'2"", 295-lb Allen has prototypical NFL size for a center.  A rock on the OL interior, he has position flexibility to play guard, where he initially started as a redshirt freshman in 2012.  Needs to be smarter on the field, as his temper tends to draw penalties. RJ Shelton, RB/WR — Shelton was one of two from the 2013 recruiting class to see the field immediately (other will be covered later).  Initially recruited to play RB, his ability to catch out of the backfield was immediately noted, and he has transformed into a flex RB/WR who can play slot or take jet sweeps.  Also handles kick returns.  His role was the same as Nick Hill's, but Shelton has the potential to play it more effectively. Josiah Price, TE — Our best pass-catching TE, Price has an uncanny ability to leak into the flats unnoticed and find the endzone, as demonstrated in this wheel route, which allegedly never worked in practice.  His blocking needs to improve if he is to become all-around great TE. Delton Williams, RB — The other to play as a true frosh in 2013, Williams' future in hazy following a brandishing a weapon charge which was later reduced to a misdemeanor.  It is rumored that he will return with a 2-4 game suspension, but we shall see.  Initially recruited to play LB, Williams is a physical runner who loves to deliver hits.  If he returns, he is the obvious candidate for the starter's role, as he is the only veteran with any substantial carries. Montae Nicholson, FS — A former track standout in Pennsylvania, Nicholson has the size of a safety mixed with the speed of a corner, at which the staff has allegedly considered him.  Nicholson played last season on special teams, and later on started over beleaguered incumbent RJ Williamson.  Given his athleticism, many are expecting a big season from Nicholson.  Aaron Burbridge, WR — Burbridge has had difficulties with injury in his career, but the former top recruit in the state of Michigan is the guy at WR.  Burbridge, who is a great mismatch with his size, must step up and find chemistry with Cook, because his number will be called this season.   Since we are MS(Excel)U, here is a graph illustrating my grades of these players, for which I offer no real explanation or context."
CFB,3dtyqh,Try_to,4,Sun Jul 19 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"Myles Jack. LB. 6'1"" 232. Jr. Everyone knows about how he plays on offense as well, let's get that boring stuff out of the way. Now to the fun stuff: he's all over the field on defense with impressive natural instincts. People ask how Eric Kendricks will be replaced, Myles Jack is your answer. He will play more in the middle this season in base packages and be shifted to the edge in nickel packages. He covers WRs in practice and it translates to games. He played man coverage on Nelson Agholor last November and shut him down. Jake Brendel. Center. 6'4"" 290. RSr. Has started all but one game since his RFr season and been gel of the OL. Despite all of the struggles of the OL, Brendel has been has been rock solid. The obvious leader of the line, which showed during the one game he missed against UVa last season.  Paul Perkins. RB. 5'11"" 198. RJr. The PAC 12's leading rusher and a complete back. Can run inside, outside and catch it out of the backfield. His pass blocking has steadily improved. He will be the focal point of the offense with Hundley gone.  Conor McDermott. LT. 6'9"" 295. RJr. UCLA fans might think this is a little too high, but I don't care, OL wins games. The former TE out of Brentwood Academy in Tennessee has great feet, long arms and every other measurable you want in a LT. He returned from injury in the middle of last season and the OL got light years better because of it.  Kenny Clark. NT. 6'3"" 308. Jr. Block eater, plain and simple. Obviously he won't have a lot of good stats as a NT, but he is the key to the defense. Was 6th on the team in tackles last season as a Nose Tackle with 58. Eddie Vanderdoes. DE/DT. 6'3"" 305. Jr. Plays a bit out of position at DE because of Kenny Clark (1st world problems, I know). Also a rock solid DL that eats up blockers and ball carriers. Deon Hollins. DE/OLB. 6'0"" 225. Jr. The best pass rusher on the team (ask K State) who is improving his pass coverage.Led the team with 9 sacks last season and has a quick first step. Jordan Payton. WR. 6'1"" 213. Sr. Have to go away from defense :(. The leader of the receiving corp and the best receiver on the team. A bit short of 1,000 yards last season in an offense that spreads the ball around a lot. He should be targeted more this season with a new QB. Fabian Moreau. CB. 6'0"" 195. Sr. The guy Jim Mora dubbed as a future 1st round draft pick in April 2014. Unsurprisingly, he didn't play up to that but was still the best cover corner on the team. Despite only having 1 career interception, he's a damn good CB. Ishmael Adams. CB/KR/PR. 5'8"" 190. RJr. Anytime he touches the ball there's a good chance it'll be a TD (ask UVa and ASU). He is low because he was physically outmatched by bigger receivers, but he will be the nickelback this season as Marcus Rios will probably move into the starting unit as well. Not because Adams is a bad corner, he has great ball skills and even played some safety last season.   These were based on ON-FIELD results, not projections.  Honorable mentions:  Randall Goforth- Safety  Jaleel Wadood- Safety  Thomas Duarte- TE/WR  Kenny Young- ILB  Josh Rosen- QB & just because hehe"
CFB,3dtyqh,clockworkblk,11,Sun Jul 19 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Nobody’s done ND yet, so I’ll go there.  We appear to have our best depth since ’93, so there could be a lot of disagreement among ND fans as to who the Top 10 are.  1) LT Ronnie Stanley, Jr (listing by eligibility, not academics as ND does) – Prototype big, athletic LT.  Excels in both run blocking and pass protection.  Projected Top 5 pick or so.  2) LB Jaylon Smith, Jr - Better than Te'o at the same point.  Has bulked up a lot and still has 4.4 speed and overall agility.  Great instincts and leadership.  3) DT Sheldon Day, Sr - CBS has him as the top senior DT in the country.  More quickness than size.  4) CB KeiVarae Russell, Sr - Elite athlete and one-time Freshman All-American missed last season in the academic scandal.  5) C Nick Martin, 5th - CBS has him as the #1 senior center.  Two-year starter.  Younger brother of All-Pro Zack.  6) WR Will Fuller, Jr - More receiving TD's last year than any returning G5 player.  Skinny kid with speed to burn.  7) S Max Redfield, Jr - One publication has him as a 1st team Preseason All-American, but that's a projection pick.  5* recruit with athleticism and physicality, but just started to put it together late last season.  8) QB Malik Zaire, So - Scared off incumbent Golson.  Possibly ND's best option threat since Tony Rice in the 80's, but a much better passer.  In terms of body language, makes a far better leader than Golson.  9) CB Cole Luke, Jr - Possibly ND's most under-the-radar talent.  Some ND insiders believe his stock could warrant leaving early for the NFL.  10) RB Tarean Folston, Jr - Tough final pick, but I can't leave him off.  Not amazing in any one trait, but very good in all of them.  Probably the last ND RB I liked more was Julius Jones in 2003."
CFB,3dtyqh,Saintlame,4,Sun Jul 19 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"I'd put Folston higher. And theoretically KeiVare should be above Day, but he's got more to prove."
CFB,3dtyqh,OneBadassTurtle,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"I couldn't quite figure out Luke last year. I know he had those interceptions, but do you have a sense for how good a corner he actually was? I seem to remember him getting burned on a few occasions, but maybe I'm misremembering."
CFB,3dtyqh,BoseSounddock,4,Sun Jul 19 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I figure about 99.9% of CB's get burned on a few occasions, but I thought he looked the part and played extremely well for a true sophomore.  Besides the four picks, he finished sixth in tackles and had more PBU than any ND player since 1978."
CFB,3dtyqh,EKrake,3,Sun Jul 19 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"KeiVare and Luke will be the best CB tandem we have had in a long, long time."
CFB,3dtyqh,Neverknowtheunknown,2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, that sounds about right, I'd say. I can't remember which game it was, but one I thought I remembered him getting thrown on a lot and, while he was doing a decent job of tackling afterward, it was sort of a sure medium gain. Might have been Louisville if he was covering Parker (though I'm not sure because I thought Parker was under wraps for most of the game), so that would be actually just fine. In any case, it's good to think we have a couple of at LEAST solid corners this year."
CFB,3dtyqh,WickedUMD,3,Sun Jul 19 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid.  Mine would be:   Smith Stanley Day Russell Fuller Joe Schmidt Folston Luke Zaire CJ Prosise   Martin is really important because he's solid and the depth behind him at center isn't, but I don't see him as in the top ten talent wise.  Maybe top 15.  Redfield really hasn't proven squat yet, but he has all the potential in the world.  We need him to be in the top ten, but he hasn't been that guy so far.  Joe Schmidt was so critical to the D last year.  He probably won't be quite as necessary this year with a much better linebacker situation, but I still expect him to start and be an impact player.  I'm really bullish on Prosise.  I think he looked like the best playmaker on offense by the end of the season, and I think he's going to be used all over the place this year as a really versatile weapon."
CFB,3dtyqh,1baussguy,7,Sun Jul 19 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"My list isn't perfect, but these are guys that i think well have a great season this year.   De'mornay pierson-el. Kick  returner with that x-factor. The type of guy who makes you think of kicking it out of bounds even when you're kicking from your own 20 yard line. Good speed and great vision. Potential to be one of our top receivers too. Terrel Newby. RB with great acceleration and good speed. Expect him to have some big plays throughout the season. Josh banderas. LB who runs the defense well. Good play recognition and tackling. Has the potential to give opposing offenses a big headache in games. Might be a bit controversial, but Tommy Armstrong Jr. strong arm (as the name implies) and has had some glimpses of great accuracy. Struggles with screen passes, and with Riley wanting to go to those often, can struggle a fair bit. However, with coaches that actually know how to develop a QB , he can become a very solid player at that position. Vincent Valentine. Huge guy but has just enough speed at DT. He was able to be pushed around a bit last year, and his pass rushing left something to be desired. But with continual development he should be much better at plugging up the middle. We need him there to give our defense a good chance at 3 & outs since he is, in my opinion, the best d lineman we have."
CFB,3dtyqh,WickedUMD,10,Sun Jul 19 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"Here are 5 more to add to your list (though I disagree on Bando being there)   Jordan Westercamp (WR) (or Westerstache as I prefer). Great hands, good speed. Nate Gerry (S). He really found his niche moving back to safety from LB. He's dangerous in the backfield. Michael Rose-Ivey (LB). Set the Nebraska Freshman record with 66 tackles in 2013. He's returning this season off an injury. Imani Cross (RB, IB?). Don't count him out. He's a returning veteran player that is great in clutch situations. Daniel Davie (CB). Don't count him out either. He started opposite of Mitchell last year and had 41 tackles."
CFB,3dtyqh,AztecMatt,10,Sun Jul 19 15:29:34 2015 UTC,No Malik Collins from either of you. I think he's a top 3 player for us
CFB,3dtyqh,novalsi,6,Sun Jul 19 16:22:44 2015 UTC,and no alex lewis. Also probably a top 3 player for us.
CFB,3dtyqh,AztecMatt,4,Sun Jul 19 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"I'd put it like this: 1. Lewis 2. Collins 3. Pierson-El 4. Valentine 5. Westerkamp 6. Banderas 7. Rose-Ivy 8. Tommy Gun 9. Newby 10. Foltz.   I really like our O line depth but too many injuries and inexperience to pick many individuals.  Newby looks like the real deal but too early to say.  Tommy's a great athlete but he has the hardest job to adjust to the new system.  Our defense up front could be a monster and good depth in the secondary.  The talent is there, but always worried with growing pains in a new system. Cross is proven but I think he'll be underutilized. Hope I'm wrong though. Still in the top 15."
CFB,3dtyqh,AztecMatt,5,Sun Jul 19 18:02:13 2015 UTC,Gerry needs to be in there. I'd place him 6 and push everyone down.

CFB,3dtyqh,Ozymandias222,3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"1) K - Brad Craddock, Senior  Best kicker in the nation. Fuck yeah. Came from Australia and sucked ass his freshman year, sophomore year was decent, but his junior year he won the Lou Groza over FSU's Aguayo.  2) CB - Will Likely, Junior  He's like 5'7"" or something like that but is a monster on the field. Led the conference in picks, real high up there in tackles and forced fumbles. Got overlooked by the Florida schools, but has been amazing both his years here.  3) If only we had three good players..."
CFB,3dtyqh,Hit_me_on_AIM,4,Sun Jul 19 14:57:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you don't need ten good players to have ten best players!"
CFB,3dtyqh,odles_44,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"Most of them we don't know that much about honestly. We had so much turnover from last year that most of it is speculation.  I'll give you a few names to look out for though since I have a little more free time:    OT - Derwin Gray, RS Fresh?  Former 4* UA All American who took a year at JuCo and then redshirted last season. Should be a huge boost to a weak OLine last year.  OG- Damian Prince, RS Fresh  Possibly even better than Gray, a 5* recruit who can play tackle or guard but also redshirted. We expect some big stuff out of this kid. Not much turnover on the line so it should go from among the worst in the B1G to one of the better one's quickly and for a few years down the line.  WR - Levern Jacobs, Senior  Has shown some potential behind Diggs and Long, but hasn't had much of an opportunity. Pretty sure he went for like 180 and a TD against Clemson when both those receivers went down two years back. Caleb was also throwing that game so hopefully they have some good chemistry to build off. His brother Taivon is also a 4* RS Freshman and could be in line for some PT after we lost our top 5 options here.  QB - Caleb Rowe, RS Junior  I have no idea what to expect from Rowe. He's played every year I believe because CJ Brown could never not get injured. Shown he can be a productive college players at times and I kinda think he'll be more consistent than Brown was. He's kinda a gun slinger and the system was never built around him so some stuff might change, especially behind a much improved OLine but unless some serious magic happens, he's just kinda a place holder until the prodigal son Haskins arrives next year.  RB - Wes Brown, Junior?  Former 4* All American, and has a good mix of speed and power. I'm thinking the OLine will really give him a chance to shine this year. Didn't really do all that much last year, but he was coming off a season long suspension and could be a breakout candidate.  LB/DE - Yannick Ngokoue(sp?), Soph  Fantastic tackler and edge rusher. Highly praised recruit coming out of high school and should be getting alot more PT this year and could be one of the better defensive players in the conference if he takes the next step.  LB/DE - Jessie Aniebom, RS Fresh?  Similar mold as Ngokoue, but we lost almost our entire front 7 and are switching to a 4-3 so there will be a possibility for early PT for another highly touted recruit.  DE/DT - Quinton Jefferson, Senior  Always been one of the better lineman on the team, but he got injured last season. Was granted an extra year and should be huge in transitioning into a new system with so much turnover in the box.    I don't think our outlook is all that terrible for this season as some people think. We're a young team with alot of talent waiting in the wings, it's just a matter of them developing now. That's going to be the story for this year because most of these guys are unproven at this point. I'm predicting 5 wins, which considering what we lost from our 7 win campaign last year is pretty decent. Whenever Haskins breaks the starting lineup will be the make or break year for the direction of the program."
CFB,3dtyqh,goblue10,3,Sun Jul 19 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"DJ Pumphrey, JR./RB- The MWC best RB last year (although BSU's Ajayi got all the hype). Way undersized, but runs like a 225lb RB. Can run inside or out, going to average 6+ YPC again this year. Calvin Munson, JR./LB- Covers the field, led team in tackles and INTs. Makes the big play when you need it.  Pearce Slater, SR./RT- 6'7"", 350 and projected NFL pick.  Alex Barret, JR./ DT- Undersized, but tenacious pass rusher. If not for being hurt last year, would have put up great sack #'s. Rashaad Penny, SO./RB- Didn't get a whole lot of touches last year as a true freshman, but he has elite ability. Passed up by most of P12 because of grades but somehow made it in to school, he would be getting touches for any P12 school this year. Nico Siragusa, JR/LG- Anchor of our OL, straight beast. NFL talent next year. Christian Heyward, SR./DE- Transfer from USC, found his gear late last season, I expect him to show up big time this year. Maxwell Smith, SR./QB- Transfer from Kentucky, if he is the starter, we expect to hopefully have the missing piece to a 10 win season/NYE bowl game. Malik Smith JR./DB- Inconsistent, makes mistakes, but is ALL-MWC type player when he is on. Just needs to calm down in big games. JJ Whitaker SR./Demontae Kazee JR, CBs- Both on award watch lists, both need to limit PIs (the 3-3-5 defense puts them on islands) but improved 10x last year. If they pick up where they left off at the end of last year, we may have 2 MWC 1st team CBs.   You can almost copy and paste this for next year too."
CFB,3dtyqh,temeraire34,3,Sun Jul 19 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"Did not realize Max wound up at SDSU.  He's a good solid football mind, but I hope for your sake that his shoulder is back to pre-injury form.  I wish that kid the best of luck."
CFB,3dtyqh,blackertai,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's down to: Him, Marriota's backup who transfered here and a couple RSFR QBs who aren't really ready yet. I hope Smith comes in and can be as consistent as he was at Kentucky. We don't need him to win games, just need him to not lose them like our last few QBs did."
CFB,3dtyqh,temeraire34,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"You can almost copy and paste this for next year too.   That's got to be a good feeling, doesn't it?  That's where ND is right now (the second year), and it's got me more excited than I've been in a long time."
CFB,3dtyqh,FutzinChamp,3,Sun Jul 19 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, for the first time since I can remember, we actually look at the depth chart and look into future schedules with excitement instead of seeing all the holes we need to fill."
CFB,3dtyqh,SouthernTiger1,3,Sun Jul 19 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"1) Adoree' Jackson - A potential starter on both sides of the ball (slot receiver and #1 corner) and one of the best returning special teams players in the country. He's got unmatched athleticism and instincts in the pac-12 (in my opinion).  2) Su'a Cravens - Moved to OLB from safety, but is a returning All-American. He was the first non-DL to lead USC in TFL in over a decade... and that was at safety. At linebacker, Cravens will likely lead the team in tackles, sacks, and TFL.   3) Cody Kessler - Returning QB and USC's heisman frontrunner. Terrific efficiency and a very good fit for the USC offense. Could potentially be a huge year for him statistically and he also looks improved as a redshirt senior.  4) Max Tuerk - Potentially the #1 center in the country. Very versatile (has played tackle, guard, and center now) and intelligent. Could be USC's first Rimington Award winner.  5) Juju Smith - A very strong wide receiver and team leader, Smith looks like an NFL player already. He has some work to do technically, but he is our #1 wide receiver next season. He has a unique combination of power, agility, and instincts.  6) Zach Banner - Absolutely massive at 6'9"", 345, and his technique has improved a ton since having a corrective surgery to improve flexibility. Unbelievably high ceiling and could be a 1st round pick for USC if he puts it all together.  7) Toa Lobendahn - A technician who will play left tackle until Chad Wheeler returns from injury. Once he can, he'll move to guard and excel. Was a Freshman All-American and should continue to be a force on our OL.  8) Antwaun Woods - A 4th year player who is huge at nose tackle. Very stout against the run and a team leader. One of those guys who you want on the field when the game is on the line.  9) Anthony Sarao - Our returning leading tackler. A bit undersized as an inside linebacker, but finds a way to impact the game. He should be a team leader as a senior and will be a rock in the front 7.  10) Kevon Seymour - Our #2 corner behind Adoree' Jackson, Seymour is a very good senior... probably one of the best USC has had in a long time actually. He has the size, length, and speed to do his job very well and will be relied upon heavily in the pass-happy pac-12.   As you can see, USC's strengths will be QB, OL, LB, and CB. Our weaknesses will be DL and TE, but thankfully we've got guys like Antwaun Woods to add some senior leadership to the DL and a host of players battling at TE. Should be a fun year for USC!"
CFB,3dtyqh,Seniorstuphey,3,Sun Jul 19 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"Quick list (feel free to add/debate) for Mississippi State:  In no particular order, 1. Dak Prescott (QB,SR): Pre-season All-SEC, 2015 Walter Camp Watch List, Maxwell, O'Brien, and Wuerffel. Best QB to come through State in... a long time. Last year was his first season as full-time starter. 8th place in Heisman voting last season. Last season, passing: 244-396 (61.6 percent, 3,449 yds, 27 TD, 11 INT) rushing: 210 attempts, 986 yards, 14 TD. Stand-out leader for the team. 36 games, 20 starts.  2. DeRunnya Wilson (WR, JR): Pre-season All-SEC. 6'5"" Receiver, one of the main targets for Dak. Has only been playing football since his senior year of HS. Was Mr. Basketball in Alabama. 25 games, 11 starts.  3. Beniquez Brown (LB, JR): Outside linebacker, great instincts.Last Season: 62 Tackles, 7.0 TFL, 2.0 Sacks, 2 INT. He is probably headed to the Draft next year. He's a very intelligent linebacker and leads that squad. 26 games, 15 starts.  4. Richie Brown (LB, JR): Played behind Benardrick McKinney last season. Butkus award watch list. No starts, but has played in 26 games, 88 total tackles. Last season was on the 1B Defense, was named Walter Camp National Defensive Player of the Week and SEC Defensive player of the week after he had 3 interceptions in the game against Texas A&M. Last year: 50 TT, 1 TFL, 3 INT.   5. Ryan Brown (DL, SR): Look for him to step into a similar role held previously by Preston Smith. Very physical and disruptive. Top returning pass rusher. Last season: 39 Tackles, 7 TFL, 3.5 Sacks. 33 games, 13 starts.  6. Chris Jones (DL, JR): On preseason All-American list. Pre-season All-SEC, National Defensive Player of the Year candidate, Bednarik and Nagurski watch list, Outland Watch list. If he does what he is capable of doing, he should end the season as one of the top DL in the country and head to get a big, first-round paycheck due to his size and capabilities (6'6"" 308). Last season: 26 tackles, 3 sacks. Was on the 1B Defense last season. 26 games, 3 starts.  7. Taveze Calhoun (CB, SR): Injured his ankle last year, should be full strength this season. Has forced at least 1 fumble each year in college. Last season: 53 TT, 9 Pass Break-Ups. Career: 101 TT, 5.5 TFL, 4 INTs. 38 games, 25 starts.  8. Will Redmond (CB, SR):Pre-season All-SEC and All-American, National Defensive Player of the Year candidate, Bednarik and Nagurski watch list. Had to sit out a year due to some recruiting snags. One of the top returning CBs in the nation. Could go very early in the Draft next year. Will also step into the role of kick returner and punt returner this next year. Last year: 51 TT, 3 TFL, 5 PBU, 3 INT. 2 of those interceptions clinched wins last year.  20 games, 0 starts.  9. Kendrick Market (CB, SR): Tore Achilles in the Egg Bowl last season, should be full strength in the fall. Last season: 49 TT, 1.5 TFL, 1 PBU. Missed Orange Bowl due to the injury. 37 games, 16 starts.  10. Fred Ross (WR, JR): Appeared in all 13 games, started 1. Last season: 30 catches, 489 yds, 5 TD. 2 games had 100+ yards. Career: 24 games, 1 start.  Others: -Nick James -Nelson Adams -Fred Brown -AJ Jefferson...and many more.  2015 Media Guide for more information"
CFB,3dtyqh,aubieismyhomie,3,Sun Jul 19 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of impact:    1) Joey Bosa, DE--looking at about 1 sack a game on average. If he doesn't get that, it's because of the constant double teams    2) Ezekiel Elliott, RB--He'll average around 150 yards and 2 touchdowns per game, putting him on the Heisman top five.    3) Joshua Perry, LB--This guy has been overshadowed so much despite putting up Shazier-like numbers. He'll have 100+ tackles to lead the team again, and probably some sacks too.     4) Taylor Decker, OT--We'll have a veteran O-line next year, and he'll be the leader. He's a future NFL player    5) JT Barrett, QB--Personally, I think he'll win the starting job. He set the B1G record for touchdowns, and if the offense hits the ground running this season, he could put up Mariota-like numbers, something he already did last year    6) Vonn Bell, S--He led the team in INTs last year and probably will again. He can also sack you. He pretty much does it all, and will be one of the first safeties off the board after this season.    7) Pat Elflein, OG--He came out of nowhere to replace the double-bird-flipping Marcus Hall after the 2013 Michigan game and there was no dropoff at all. Now with a whole year starting, he's recognized as one of the best guards in CFB.    8 Darron Lee, LB--Came out of nowhere, unheralded as a recruit, and took the field by storm. He's lightning fast, sneaky, disruptive, and will likely be the focus of opposing coordinators' plans this year.    9) Cameron Johnston, P--Legatron is the best punter in CFB, but Johnston, who grew up playing Australian-rules football (and his style shows it), makes a great case for #2.    10) Michael Thomas, WR--He has it all: size, speed, hands, route-running, and he blocks like a champ. He'll hit the 1,000 yard mark as the focal point of our air attack next year."
CFB,3dtyqh,Shaquarington_Bithus,3,Sun Jul 19 21:44:42 2015 UTC,"Top 5 is very clear IMO, 6-10 gets a little bit congested / too close to call.   Sheldon Rankins (SR, DE): A 300-pound tank at the line of Louisville's 3-4 defense, Rankins led the team in sacks last season  and is one of the last players of Charlie Strong's recruiting. Third-team All-ACC last season, and I honestly expect him to be a first-team all conference selection by the year's end.  James Burgess (SR, MLB): He has been one of my favorite players since his arrival. He does a lot of things really well - gets tackles in open space, has great coverage skills for a linebacker, and can pursue the quarterback if needed. Out of all the players on Louisville's roster, I think Burgess projects the best to the NFL. Keith Kelsey (SR, MLB): One of the team's top tacklers last season (87), can also get to the quarterback (6.0 sacks in 2014), and had an unfortunate run of almost defensive TDs last season. Him and Burgess are a great MLB tandem that compliment each other with different skillsets. DeVonte Fields (JR, OLB / Edge): Most of you know him from his short tenure at TCU, where he won numerous freshman awards and was All Big-12. He got kicked out of TCU for assaulting his then girlfriend, went to junior college and signed on with Louisville for the 2015 class. With Lorenzo Mauldin gone to the NFL, Fields is a more than satisfactory replacement if he can stay out of trouble, and adding Burgess / Kelsey / Rankins to the mix is why Louisville will have one of the best front sevens not just in the ACC, but the entire country. Brandon Radcliff (RS JR, RB): Radcliff will far and away be our best offensive player entering this season. He led the team in rushing yards and touchdowns last season in a stacked backfield that included former Auburn RB Michael Dyer, underrated bruiser Dominique Brown and freshman LJ Scott (all of whom rushed for 100 yards in at least one game). Radcliff is a tough man to bring down because he is pound-for-pound one of the strongest Louisville players on the roster, with a 585-pound squat (keep in mind Radcliff is 5'9"", 215 lbs.). Ja'Quay Savage (JR, WR): Although James Quick is the leading returning receiver this season, I think Savage has more upside this season. He has a lot of the same physical attributes that DeVante Parker brought to the table (6'3"", 214), but he is a large unknown to most fans. Like Fields, Savage is a transfer (Texas A&M) and came as what I call a ""tandem package"" with Louisville CB Shaq Wiggins (from UGA). Savage is known for good body control and strong catching ability. Josh Harvey-Clemons (JR, S): In the last few seasons, Louisville has developed really good safeties, from 2013 1st-round pick Calvin Pryor to Gerod Holliman who tied an NCAA record 14 interceptions last season. Harvey-Clemons is also a transfer from UGA, reuniting with defensive coordinator Todd Grantham along with Shaq Wiggins. When you look at Harvey-Clemons, he has unbelievable size for his position (6'5"", 230 lbs.) and has a reputation as a hitter and making big plays. James Quick (JR, WR): A homegrown product from Louisville Trinity HS, Quick was the leading receiver before Parker went on a massive run to close the season. Quick started last season as an outside receiver, but Petrino has moved him to the slot because of Quick's route-running skills and speed. He'll likely rotate in and out with freshman Traveon Samuel, but Quick should be an easy target for whoever becomes Louisville's starting QB in 2015. Will Gardner (JR, QB) / Reggie Bonnafon (SO, QB): While our QBs are not as talented as the trio at Ohio State, these two quarterbacks are the favorites to be the starter in 2015. Will Gardner is your prototypical tall pocket-passer QB, with an accurate arm and usually consistent decision making. He struggled to stay healthy, but Gardner posted a 4:1 TD/INT ratio. Bonnafon has been the best performer in the spring, and has also only been a quarterback for two whole seasons. Bonnafon possesses wicked arm strength, but is relatively raw in terms of playing the position with pocket awareness, understanding timing and other nuances. What Bonnafon lacks in quarterback experience, he makes up for it with raw athleticism as a runner. Louisville will also have a 4* true freshman QB in Lamar Jackson, who has been highly touted by the fan base. Aaron Epps (SR, OL): Our offensive line is replacing a lot of good talent going to the NFL, but Epps is likely our best lineman this season. He came into the starting lineup halfway through the season replacing the transferred Ryan Mack, anchoring the RT position. He's best in run blocking (part of why our running game was so effective towards the end of last season), and passes as a pass-blocker. May end up manning the valuable LT position due to experience, but if he stays at RT, I'd say he'll be our best lineman throughout the season.   Honorable Mention: L.J. Scott (SO, RB); DeAngelo Brown (JR, DT); Jermaine Reve (SR, S); Jamari Staples (JR, WR); Shaq Wiggins (JR, CB)"

CFB,3dumyx,flyingcrayons,5,Sun Jul 19 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"I've been watching highlights of Adoree from summer workouts and it's scary how easily he's able to make plays. It looks like he's barely trying compared to some of teammates. A simple example is this seemingly effortless play. The thing is though, he does stuff like that every time he's practicing like it's commonplace, when other players might have one play like that all summer and it will be their highlight moment.  I'm really excited about his upcoming season, I think he's put on a little weight and will be a bit more physical this year which was really only his weakness. Plus he'll get even more time on offense with the ball in his hands as he's actually had time to learn the playbook. He's going to be fun to watch in 2015."

It's really not his fault, he was humble and came in as a walk-on, so he really wasn't expected to be THE GUY, but he just wasn't made for this level of football.

I'm not letting Saban off that easy especially since he's told his teams he wasn't going to leave and ended up doing so several times in the past.

We always lost any game of consequence, and sometimes lost games of no consequence, or played down anyways (looking at you 2011 Kentucky game -- losing to a fucking WR at QB -- and 2010 UAB game where we jumped up and celebrated like we just won a national title after beating them in 2 OT's) Not to mention, he always found a way to embarrass us in press conference, whether it be the comment about proper showering technique, or the whole thing about Rommel, it was rare when we got publicity for good things when he was coach.

CFB,3dw044,Drunken_Wanderer,5,Mon Jul 20 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"It's easy to say that sort of thing now. When I was a kid, barely any college football games were televised at all. In the 1980s SCOTUS struck down the NCAA's TV regulations and the TV market for college football absolutely exploded. I can't describe how huge a deal it was. Hundreds of college football games hit the airwaves, because conferences could now individually negotiate their own TV contracts and air their own games. This was also the death knell for a lot of independent programs, who either died out or joined other conferences to increase negotiating leverage. Once this happened, TV replays in some form were inevitable.  edit: since I rambled off topic a bit, I'll add that one of the biggest controversies was whether to allow the officials to access broadcast or scoreboard video for instant replay decisions. Many conferences, including the Big 10 and PAC-10, felt that unfair calls shown repeatedly on the scoreboard would incite disorder, and so limited the officials to broadcast video only. I remember this being an issue in one or two games. Now I believe the policy is unlimited access for all teams."

CFB,3dw044,GatorGoat1,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:41 2015 UTC,teams that play in games with instant replay have the opportunity to have possible game-altering calls reversed. Teams that play games without instant replay just have to live with whatever decision the officials make. It isn't fair to make some teams have to settle for a lesser standard of officiating.

CFB,3dvopu,DescretoBurrito,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think Dykes is safe after what Cal did last year.   The whole Pac-12 seems safe. Washington State gives Leach another couple of years. MacIntyre should be safe with a couple of conference wins (we're setup well for on field improvement sips Homer-Ade). Sark, Petersen, and Anderson are all too new at their schools to be cut loose so soon. While Stanford has taken a few steps back since Luck, the team has been successful with Shaw. Helfrich just went to the National Championship and coached the Ducks first Heisman winner. Mora, Graham, and Rodriguez have all been successful enough that it would be crazy to call any their seats hot. Whittingham had a public spat with the administration during the offseason, which seems to expect him to achieve in the Pac-12 what he did in the MWC. I'd say his seat is the hottest, although that's relative, as his seat is pretty cold (just not as cold as the rest). After him would be Leach and MacIntyre if either goes winless in conference play.  Golden's seat is hotter than Miami beach though. I think that nothing short of a division title can save him."

Lexington is a beautiful city and campus is close enough to downtown that you can access so much without having to drive.
CFB,3du8ch,camb42,6,Sun Jul 19 15:23:02 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  It would take an eternity to truly list everything.  This barely cuts it.  The best way to discover great eateries is to explore.
CFB,3du8ch,LOLmodel,0,Sun Jul 19 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"This seems like a bit of hyperbole to me.  If you count everything from Commonwealth Stadium up to downtown between High St and Limestone, I still don't see finding 100 places.  And that's when you include multiple fast food places like Jimmy John's, McDonald's, and Fazoli's.   There are good places to eat and drink but not near those kinds of numbers.  On or near Euclid there are a few good bars and a few good restaurants.  Same for Limestone, same for downtown."

One of the nice perks of it is that there is outdoor seating where you can order a beer tower. Last year when Marshal came to town (for some reason we and Marshal seem to have a rivalry despite not playing much throughout our histories; this could stem from us beating them the year after the plane crash), both Marshal fans and Miami fans flooded the cobblestone main street of Oxford, High Street. It was much more packed than I've seen for any game besides when we play Cincinnati or this past year when we played Dayton in basketball."

In other words, is there a year like 2016 or 2017 where it seems like will coalesce into a SEC East contending team, or does this feel like more of a gradual upward trajectory?"
CFB,3du8ch,remwin,6,Sun Jul 19 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't even read the other responses, but in my opinion, 2016 should be looked at as ""the year.""   I count 17 TOTAL seniors on the roster, compared to 16 redshirt freshmen from a top 25 recruiting class. Most of that class hasn't even played a down and will see their first action this season. The majority of our outgoing seniors will be from the defensive secondary so it's important that we get some good depth & experience there now.  As for the rest of the team, in 2016, most of our receivers will be juniors, Tolwes a senior, the OL is being bolstered with 4 star recruits that will have a couple of years experience, and RBs will be upperclassmen as well.   2015 may be a good year, but 2016 should be the real year to see major improvement."
CFB,3du8ch,camb42,5,Sun Jul 19 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's necessary a certain year that sticks out in my mind in terms of definitive success.

It is gradual, but it is getting there."

We're just now scratching the surface of being able to say ""Okay, we're going bowling this year!""  I will definitely say though, that if there was ever a time for us to grab the chance at being a contender in our division, it's now. South Carolina will see a shift in the next few years depending on when Spurrier leaves, Florida has a lot of recovery to go through, and Tennessee is rebuilding right now. If Stoops can really get this program rolling and we can improve on the same pace as the rest of the division, I see no reason why we can't make it to Atlanta."

CFB,3du8ch,TheHelpWouldBeNice,5,Sun Jul 19 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"Again referring to Miami: Many people are going to look at us and expect an enormously lackluster performance again; however, I see us having a very mediocre season rather than a lackluster one. _~ Some reasons for that:   A new coach and coaching staff have brought new recruits, ideas, strategies, and an entirely revamped atmosphere to the entire city of Oxford. For the first time since I've been here (nearly 5 years), this is the year with the most buzz surrounding the team despite us hosting some NFL caliber talent in previous years (Zak Dysert in the past and the new Green Bay Packer Quintin Rollins). With a better atmosphere, our homefield advantage might actually develop into a home field advantage. Traditionally we don't have big or loud crowds for anything but Hockey but I'm expecting above average numbers to at least start out the season. Last year a lot of our games were close until the end. We found ourselves unable to hang down the stretch. Even Marshal, who had an incredible season, was a close game for a while. We seemed to have a comparable amount of talent as other teams; we were just unable to stop ourselves from losing down the stretch. I think that if we get some confidence and start a winning streak early we could be a legitimate MAC-level contender for a low-level bowl game.  __^ Miami has a lot of traditional success. We have been a University for over 200 years (we were chartered while Florida was still owned by Spain). A little bit of success and a solid coaching staff (we are the cradle of coaches after all; look up former awesome coaches that came from Miami. It's incredible) could lead to years of success. I think the new head coach (Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in years past) knows this and will pull out all of the stops. Our facilities have been upgraded bringing energy to players and potential recruits. Ben Roethlisberger, a Miami alum, donated a lot of money to the University so that we could build an all new indoor facility. As a person who has been inside of the facility, it is beautiful and can only help the team. Moreover, our lifting facility underwent some improvements recently as well. Lastly, we recently came into possession of a new lifting area which is being converted into a new adequate space for club sports, bringing club sports out of recreational and varsity lifting areas into their own area. With new areas dedicated to varsity athletes, we should see some added draw to recruits as well as more development from current athletes. We've sent players to the NFL in recent years. The limelight still shines on us even in our down years. We could rise up fast and furious if we get rolling."
CFB,3du8ch,thermoroach,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, of all the MAC schools I think Miami has the most potential. If they started selling beer at games, that would attract a lot more people"

CFB,3du8ch,RollBigBlue,4,Sun Jul 19 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"If the pieces click, a low-tier bowl team. While that doesn't sound too great, just Kentucky even getting to a bowl game again is a big step in the right direction."
CFB,3du8ch,Evanjm7,5,Sun Jul 19 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"Bowl team. We have 3 OOC cupcake games, UL Lafayette, Eastern Kentucky, and Charlotte, and we should be able to win in Nashville in November against Vanderbilt. I'm banking on this team beating Florida and pulling another upset at home, getting us to that illustrious six win mark. My top guess would probably be Louisville.  If we didn't have 8 home games this year I'd be worried about our bowl hopes."
CFB,3du8ch,AlfCock,0,Sun Jul 19 15:14:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't exactly call Lafayette a cupcake team.  They are coming off a bowl win and a 9-4 season.

It's a pretty exciting tradition that is growing in fan support with each passing game.  Edit:  I also failed to mention the performance of ""My Old Kentucky Home"" by the band before each home game.  I may be biased, but I believe it is the most beautiful state song in the country.

Offense- Kentucky has a lot of potential this year at WR with multiple soph coming back from starting their true freshman year like Alexander Montgomery, Dorian Baker, or Blake Bone"
CFB,3du8ch,jayhawx19,4,Sun Jul 19 15:30:06 2015 UTC,Which game defines your teams season?
CFB,3du8ch,dybuell,7,Sun Jul 19 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'll say the Florida game. After getting hosed in last year's game, they should be pretty fired up about this one. And if they can finally get over the hump and beat Florida, it'll go a long way in making Kentucky more relevant in football and give them a ton of confidence."
CFB,3du8ch,TheHelpWouldBeNice,3,Sun Jul 19 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"For Miami:  Cincinnati. 100%. Most likely, a win over Wisconsin will not happen and a win over Presbyterian had better happen. This is a rival and a team that our team is trained to hate. Traditionally, Oxford buzzes around this time. As stated in previous posts, we need to get rolling. We need to get our confidence up. We have had close games with Cincinnati and although the highlight of the game in past years has been a punt (88 yarder I believe), we've hung in there. If we can sneak out a win, if we can take down a sleeping giant in Cincy, we can have an incredible season. We just need to get the rock rolling and it will pick up steam early."
CFB,3du8ch,thermoroach,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:32 2015 UTC,A win over Cincinnati would be a program shifting game. Beating Ohio would be nice too
CFB,3du8ch,UKats1996,4,Mon Jul 20 00:59:56 2015 UTC,"Probably Louisville. Reality may be Kentucky is one win away from a bowl game going into this game like last year (though I think we have the potential to get 6 before Louisville), and Kentucky has lost the last 4 to the Cards. Gotta put little brother back in his place :P -A early upset like Florida/Mizzou at home could also set the tone for the season   Edit :As everyone has pointed out Florida, but call me crazy even though if I had to choose one game to win it would be Florida, I don't think that would be the thing that defines the year if we get a bowl. A win over Louisville to cement a 6 or 7 win year would be the defining moment of this season because a bowl game is a must this year if Kentucky wants any recruiting momentum to keep coming."
CFB,3du8ch,topher3003,6,Sun Jul 19 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"Louisville was my first thought too. A Florida win would make people remember this season for years even if you end up going 4-8, but a loss doesn't really change things."
CFB,3du8ch,MrKentucky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno, we haven't beaten them in 27 years; so even if they were 0-12 it would probably still make people remember the season."
CFB,3du8ch,Evanjm7,4,Mon Jul 20 14:00:05 2015 UTC,You make a good point about Louisville. They could definitely be our ticket to a bowl game. In fact there's a big chance they will be.
CFB,3du8ch,crappysandwich,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:57 2015 UTC,Florida. Need to end that losing streak this season and Florida will be somewhat more vulnerable than in years past with their new coach.

CFB,3du8ch,crappysandwich,3,Sun Jul 19 15:02:49 2015 UTC,I would say Jeff Badet or Alex Montgomery. Both were knocked out last season with unusual injuries and both seemed to be exceeding expectations during spring practices.

CFB,3du8ch,camb42,4,Sun Jul 19 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"While Kentucky's basketball history began far earlier, the seminal moment in Kentucky Basketball's history was by far the hiring of Adolph Rupp.  Before him, they were good, but with him, they became a powerhouse.  He was a coaching legend in every sense of the word.    It's basically impossible for UK Football to emulate the success they have had in basketball.  To get fans truly excited for UK Football, they need a coach who is a solid recruiter and is willing to stick around for a while to build.  Otherwise, they'll face the same cycle of decline every few years."

CFB,3du8ch,Evanjm7,5,Mon Jul 20 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"I know that you guys are very solidly a basketball school, but how would you generally describe your school's attitude towards the football team?   We know we suck. We joke about it a lot. We sulk about it a lot. When we're close to the end of a game, we wonder ""Great, now it's time to fuck it up.""  But in the end of it all, we're passionate about our school, we love watching and cheering for them, and we all bleed blue. UK is a culture here in Kentucky, and whether we're watching Calipari take another group of fresh talent to the Final Four or Stoops take the football team to the swamp for 3OT fiesta, we cheer them on, we celebrate the victories, and we mourn the losses.    Since you guys are a basketball school, do you feel that you still fit in culturally with the rest of the SEC, or are you the odd one out?   I feel like we're an essential piece of the conference. We're a founding member, and while we're not a football program by any standards, we are one of the perennial basketball programs in the nation. That's a big piece IMO for any conference to have.    What is your opinion on Mark Stoops and do you feel he is taking the program in the right direction?   He's a signal of hope that we haven't had since Brooks, which seems like an eternity ago. His recruiting has been amazing so far and being a former DC for Florida State makes me optimistic about future wins, since we'll need an excellent D to win any SEC games.   I feel like he's taking our program in the right direction, and I hope the majority understand how big of a project this is. I hope he doesn't get snubbed or stolen before he can finish his build up, because I think he can make us a really good program if given the time.   Last season you went 5-7. What needs to happen for Kentucky to get to 6 wins this year for a bowl berth?   We need to get lucky on a couple games, hope we can make the right plays and pull a big upset. Our chances are significantly better having 8 home games. If we didn't have that many, I'd be skeptical about our bowl chances.  If we can close out the close games, we can get there. If we were able to close out Florida, Mississippi State, and Louisville, we could have ended up 8-4. But we missed our chances. Missing a FG in 3OT, making the worst onside kick ever, and dropping a would-be interception resulted in three extra losses."
CFB,3du8ch,camb42,3,Mon Jul 20 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"He's a signal of hope that we haven't had since Brooks, which seems like an eternity ago.    My God you're right on that.  Those were the days..."
CFB,3du8ch,camb42,3,Mon Jul 20 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"Lots of good questions here!   Edit:  bolded my answers  I know that you guys are very solidly a basketball school, but how would you generally describe your school's attitude towards the football team?  Self aware is the best term to use.  Kentucky fans know we don't have the greatest football tradition, but it's not as if it takes years to revitalize an interest in the team.  If they start winning, you can feel an uptick in fan morale.   Since you guys are a basketball school, do you feel that you still fit in culturally with the rest of the SEC, or are you the odd one out?  Well, it is a bit odd to be a basketball school in a football conference, but basically every conference has a team or two like that (Duke and Syracuse in the ACC, Kansas in the Big XII, etc.).  It's just something that I've come to accept rather than feel alienated for.  What is your opinion on Mark Stoops and do you feel he is taking the program in the right direction?  After the Joker years, I would have taken basically anyone.  Luckily, Stoops was a good hire.  It has been a tough rebuild, but his recruiting ability and his name have really been boosts for the program.  UK has never been able to really compete for some of these four star recruits in the past, and it's such a refreshing feeling to actually care about recruiting for once.  I still support him, but I do believe that he'll need to have UK in a bowl this season to keep support so high.  Last season you went 5-7. What needs to happen for Kentucky to get to 6 wins this year for a bowl berth?  Kentucky just needs to recognize that they are capable of getting seven wins this season.  The talent that Stoops has brought in is finally piecing itself together.  They have the potential."

CFB,3du8ch,TheHelpWouldBeNice,3,Mon Jul 20 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"It is annoying. The main reason that it is so annoying is that we were the first Miami. We were chartered before the US owned Florida. That being said we can't change to Oxford by any means (the name of the city in which our university is situated) due to Oxford University and several other universities having an Oxford home. I'd enjoy it if we started referring to Miami (FL) as The U more and us as Miami U more. Our names as a whole aren't the same. Miami loves the U. Let's call them that.  Chuck Martin, our head football coach, was previously the offensive coordinator for Notre Dame. Before that he had a great deal of success at Grand Valley State University I believe (a storied football university). Martin has the potential to go big at Miami and then down the road at other universities if he so chooses to leave. Miami will improve this year. We have two games on our schedule that should almost automatically be wins. Therefore, an improvement on 2-10 should be possible. To be frank, I'm hoping (and see potential) in 6-6. Alumni hate the fact that we've changed to the redhawks. A great deal of them were avidly against it. What is amusing is that we were coerced into this. While our former name of the Miami Redskins could be conceived as inappropriate, we do actually have a very good relationship with the native american tribe that used to be there. In the new student center that we built on campus, there is a location that is purely informative on our two storied histories and how they intertwine. All in all, I don't mind. Redhawks seems relatively lame, but at least we stuck with the ""red"" theme that goes with all of our red brick buildings and roads so very well."
CFB,3du8ch,LarpMaster2000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:57 2015 UTC,"For Miami (OH) Fans:  Do you hate the '(OH)' that almost everyone puts after your name and if so how much and what alternatives do you suggest?   Yes, I 100% hate it. Our school is older. Our school has more students. Our school has more football wins. They are the imposters. Not us. I understand that they have had more recent success in the 80s-early 00s so that's why it is what it is. If you really feel the need to refer to us as something other than Miami, I would suggest the Miami Redhawks. No one would get confused and it's less demeaning that way.   You guys have been referred to as the cradle of coaches, once being home to legendary coaches like Woody Hayes and Bo Schembechler, as well as other great coaches like Jim Tressel, John Harbaugh, and Sean Payton. Is there anyone currently associated with with the football program, coach or player, that you think could become a successful head coach at Miami or at a different program?   Honestly, I have no idea about current people. One former coach who could be successful again someday if given the chance is Michael Haywood. He was our coach in 09-10. In his first season we went 1-11, but in year 2 we won the MAC and went 9-4. It was a great turnaround and he accepted the job at the University of Pittsburgh. He was also an African-American coach which is usually seen as a plus considering how few there are. However, he was arrested for domestic violence shortly after his hire by Pittsburgh and immediately fired before the season started. He has been out of football since although Tulane gave him an interview. If given another shot, he might be able to be successful.   Last season you went 2-10, an improvement from 0-12. Do you feel that Miami will continue to improve this year, stay the same, or regress?   I really hope there is improvement. To go from MAC champions my freshman year to winless in my senior year was quite the tumble. Last year as a grad student, the joy of winning a single game was pretty funny. Anyway I expect improvement because it's hard not to improve from 2-10. As a Michigan fan, it was the same with Rich Rod. How could he not improve from his first 2 seasons of 3-9 and 5-7. That doesn't mean we will be contending for the MAC anytime soon but we should get better.    Miami used to go by the name Redskins before it was changed to RedHawks. Do you think this is a good change, a bad change, or is a rose by any other name smell just as sweet?   The name change occurred in 1996 so I don't know the school as anything other than the Redhawks so for me I don't care. The school still sells a little Redskins stuff for the people who graduated before then and I bet they care. From what I understand, the term Redskin is actually considered offensive to the Miami tribe and they asked that we change our name. That to me is enough reason to make the change. If you are offending the very people the school is named after, then that isn't right. Although I would love to see this study redone by Sports Illustrated. In 2002, 69% of Native Americans and 57% of those who live on reservations felt that it was okay the Redskins name to still be used. However, if the Miami tribe asked us to change the name, that's all that really matters and makes it the right call."

OH GOD THE HORROR.  @ Maryland (sort of) - they shake our hands this year, but with thumbtacks sticking out of their gloves. 7 fumbles later, another L.  Illinois - we probably still win  @ Northwestern - game before a home game Whiteout vs. Michigan and weird shit happens in Evanston  BYE - we got crushed by this opponent in 2011...  Michigan - by now , Harbaugh has his squad rolling and we are injured and hopeless  @ Michigan State - idk we're gonna lose this one regardless"

If one has a bad game, or a loss, Urban will be hearing about the other two non-stop from fans and media.  Sure it's a great problem to have 3 potential starters, but it's still a problem.  I just really want whoever starts the season to do well and not receive a bunch of flack from people if he has an off game or something.  We're spoiled lately."

I also don't see any scenario outside of going 3-9 or worse with no major injuries where Jones is fired. No matter what, Hart will give him 4 years to keep recruiting and at least stock the roster for the next guy.   That said, I think and hope he's our guy for the long haul."

The roster is already set up to be stacked for the next guy, thered be no need to keep him.  I dont think any of this happens and I think Butch does fine but if he only managed to win 4 games this season hed be gone no matter the circumstances."
CFB,3dvqsu,zip_zap_zip,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:31 2015 UTC,Alcorn State - automatic win.  Tulane - could give us fits again.  Notre Dame - not national contenders but not pushovers either.  Duke - has beaten us the past 2 years iirc.  UNC - unpredictable as hell.  Clemson - anything can happen to rivals.  Pitt - loaded at skill positions.  FSU - keep winning the conference.

I'll commit sudoku if we actually lose an OOC game, so let's assume we survive SMU, Lamar, and Rice. We open conference play against Tech, who almost beat us last year, and they should be better this year. We could feasibly lose that game. We then play KU, WVU, and ISU, whom I'm confident we'll beat because WVU is a revenge game at home, and the talent disparity between us and KU/ISU is just too great. This puts us at 6-1, but then we face KSU, OU, OSU, TCU, and Texas, which could turn out to be a pretty nasty stretch. We could, in the darkest timeline, lose our final five games of the season."

Given all the experience we have in the two-deep depth chart (partially thanks to the injuries last year), I'd be shocked we went 7-5, even WITH some position losses. We're going to be extremely good in the trenches, including the 2nd string with the addition of Jerry Tillery as a true freshman as a backup DT to Jones/Day, and then with what should be one of the country's best offensive lines. The skill players all over are set, with Fuller/Robinson/Brown/Prosise/Carlisle at WR and RBs of Folston/Prosise/Bryant.  I have no idea what to truly expect (because not a down has been played), but going less than 9 wins with this team being healthy should be damn near impossible."

We struggle with Iowa St. relying on a goal line stand to win the game.   We lose to West Virginia due to the fact that our offense could not move the ball at against their improved defense  We don't beat KU by 20+ points.

CFB,3dvqsu,Buckfutters,0,Mon Jul 20 01:11:32 2015 UTC,"I gotta go with 7-5 being the plausible worst case. We were 5-7 last season with atrocious coaching. Utah, Rutgers, Maryland, and there's even an argument that the Minnesota game could have all been won with better coaching and player development.   Michigan beats Rutgers at the Big House this season.  Lose to Utah, Maryland, and Minnesota (all away).  Michigan goes 3-1 in the non-conference. Replacing the Notre Dame away loss with a BYU home win.  Michigan then goes 4-4 in conference play with losses to Ohio State, Michigan State, Minnesota, and Maryland. Wins against Rutgers, Indiana, Penn State, and Northwestern.  Absolute worst case would be 5-7 (losses to BYU and Penn State) again but I just don't see it with the talent this team has and the fact that there will actually be good coaching this season.  Do I think we'll see a Urban Meyer type turnaround after the Luke Fickell debacle? No, absolutely not, Harbaugh has a much tougher task ahead of him than that.

Iowa-South Carolina  Florida-Illinois (yes, I'm putting these two teams on par with each other. They had a very similar record.)

Big 12 - Kansas - sorry Jayhawks, sometimes its fun to watch a dumpster fire.   B1G - Minnesota - do they take another step forward and finally beat Wisconsin? Do they maintain their current progress? Or do they start to slip back? They're a tough team.  CUSA - WKU/Marshall - Big time offensive talent. Should be lots of fireworks.  MAC - UMass - damn near return everybody, lots of offensive talent, not great defensively, but they have nothing to lose in their last season in a conference.  MWC - Utah State - Chuckie Keeton's back, Matt Wells could be the Jim McElwain of 2015 with another solid year.  PAC - Utah - Wanted to say Cal because of Goff, but Utah seems more well rounded. Solid defense, RB Devontae Booker deserves to be better known than he is, kind of like Travis Wilson at QB, and amazingly elite special teams.  SEC - Texas A&M - so much potential...lots of elite youth, very explosive, could take a big step forward, some chance they could backslide and things could become a disaster. Sumlin's teams are just  fun to watch.  SBC - Georgia Southern - They scored 55 rush TDs last year. Just absurd. They seem to play really well against P5s."

I was lamenting that a lot of times it's a fan that does it or maybe an intern in the media department and they are often just a low quality hot mess. I said this is ND though so you know the media department is gonna kill it.  Then I open this video. The quality of video is amazing. The cuts are great. The timing of transitions are superb.  The music starts building and I am so amped for the drop and the action to start. Then the wailing comes and it doesn't go away.  I'm not trying to poop on the music but it just seems so out of place. The highs are too damn loud and doesn't fit the scene at all.  10/10 with sound off though. Still not sure if fan made or media department.

CFB,3dva6j,damping,6,Sun Jul 19 22:18:10 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed (especially if we're looking at the way we played that night). This is what a normal discussion looks like. Not our fault Oregon and KSU screwed up. If they didn't, they'd have been in and ND wouldn't have, most likely. Just like everyone who arrives at the NCG, yes EVERYONE, some luck is always involved along the line.  Shitty game for ND, yes, but ""didn't deserve to be there"" shows a very sophomoric understanding of what ND accomplished that year (unless you intentionally leave out the good games, which many do, as we see above), close games or not. As is typical, some of that treatment is intentionally there just to annoy others. It does well on /r/CFB sometimes because ""lol 2012 ND"" is a common sentiment around here."

CFB,3dva6j,ItsZizk,4,Sun Jul 19 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"Notre Dame would have gotten in over OSU. Most likely Bama wouldn't have gotten in. ND beat two P5 conference champions in 2012. OSU played one ranked team all year.  OSU let Indiana score 49 points against them and went to overtime against Purdue.  Please, continue to showcase that ignorance. It is very clear you have no idea what you are talking about. Stop using the transitive property. Just because you barely lost to Bama doesn't mean shit. Youngstown state beat Pitt that year. We had to go to overtime to beat Pitt. Does that mean Youngstown State was better than us, and therefore also better than the Pac 12 and Big 12 champs? No it fucking doesn't.  I don't think a Georgia team who got destroyed by SC 35-7 would have had a chance against us since obviously we are basing the entire season on one game. It would be ridiculous to think teams have good and bad games.  Oh, and just between you and me, the BCS voters had ND ranked #1 before the game.

CFB,3dva6j,hirolord,3,Sun Jul 19 22:21:05 2015 UTC,I'm worried about ND. They are going to be healthy and out to prove they weren't healthy last year when we blew them out of the water in a very embarrassing manner. It's going to be a fun game.
CFB,3dva6j,blackoutfish,4,Sun Jul 19 23:41:44 2015 UTC,They bring back their entire starting defense and they got rid of golson. This will be the best team HCBK has ever put on the field.
CFB,3dva6j,Wolf482,3,Mon Jul 20 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Zaire played half against us last year and it was a huge improvement for them. And in bringing back their entire defensive crew that was either injured or suspended for half of the game last time we played, I don't think we will be throwing 6 TD's against them again. If we do Kessler wins the Heisman uncontested. But I suspect a hell of a game."

But, frankly, we've done better when NOT having a BYE, IMO. Our ""bad"" Navy performance last year was after FSU then a BYE, our close win over USC in 2013 was after a BYE following the big win in Dallas over ASU. Whereas we had three games leading up to FSU last year, including the high-scoring close game with UNC right before.  We'll probably be more prepped also due to the fact that we can probably use UMass to practice some of our game plan for Clemson's defense."

CFB,3dva6j,HoustonFrog,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about it. Hotels aren't plentiful around Clemson. :p  But, my biggest thing is I may have a family thing going on that weekend. However, depending on how that thing happens, I may actually be close enough to drive down for it, so we'll see!  How's the ticket scene around the stadium leading up to game time? Overpriced?"
CFB,3dva6j,CLU_Three,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"No....no they aren't. Although you could easily find a hotel in Greenville, and it's about a 30ish minute drive away. Nice city as well, though if it's a night game you'll have trouble getting back to Greenville. Clemson isn't built for 80,000 people leaving at once lol."
CFB,3dva6j,polar_bears,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"Indeed. South Bend is kind of shitty leaving too.  I edited/added a bit about tickets above, but I'll ask again...are they ""easy"" to find at a not-too-hideous markup around the stadium before gametime? Otherwise, I'll just have to try the stubhub route, which isn't TOO hideous right now."
CFB,3dva6j,CompletelyProtocol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh I've never bought tickets off the streets. Except once my senior year of high school when I came to my first game. Paid $40 for top deck against North Carolina, so I'd say they're pretty pricey. I'd go the StubHub route personally if you were thinking of going."
CFB,3dva6j,polar_bears,2,Mon Jul 20 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"I probably should be more worried about Oklahoma State, given how we've played in Stillwater since joining the Big 12, but last season really changed my perception of their team. They're a big game obviously, but I'm more worried about Baylor, Oklahoma and even Kansas State to a certain extent."

CFB,3dva6j,OSU_Silver_Bullets,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"I think the Kansas game won't be nearly as close as it was this year. That was such a weird game, and it felt like it had a lot more to do with us not wanting to be there than anything Kansas actually did. I think a lot of the players will remember feeling embarrassed after that game and want to take care of business this year.  As for West Virginia, I'd bet it's close like always. It's developing into a nice rivalry so another tight game (possibly going into overtime) wouldn't surprise me at all."
CFB,3dva6j,FuckAHokie,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about almost every game this year. I'm not too worried about ISU/KU, though maybe I should be."
CFB,3dva6j,reesejenks520,3,Sun Jul 19 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"Baylor  They run a good system of high power offense and benefit from the plug-n-play type players, but they have always struggled coming into to Stillwater. It seems like they we have their number every time they player here. Our defense looks really good this year and our offense can only get better from where we left off. It will be another shoot out but I still see us winning. Oklahoma  Last few Bedlams have been battles and fun to watch. Having competitive games now makes the rivalry better. Questions at QB will bother OU and their ability to move the ball besides their running game. Bob has a good record at BPS, but I think OSU is overall better team this year.  Texas/KSU  Combining the two because both will be interesting teams this year. Bill Snyder always finds a way to have a great team that competes. Never doubt him to make a run at the title. Texas has lots of talent and a coach trying to rebuild a program into his own. These two can be tricky games for us.  TCU  Arguably the best team in the conference. Boykin went from being a joke to Heisman hopeful. They got a very good offense coordinator (your welcome) and their defense is stacked. I expect a shootout and a noisy BPS to be ready to rumble. I love for us to start a mini-rivarly with TCU."

Until I see changes, I refuse to feel confident about this game.     TCU - they have enough playmakers to be borderline unstoppable on offense, as we saw against TTU and Ole Miss last year.   @OSU - playing in Stillwater is tough, and they should be an improved team. That being said, their Oline is very shaky, they don't have a genuine running threat currently, and they don't have the typical WR's for Mason Rudolph to throw to. Potentially great QB aside, that's useless without an adequate supporting cast (see Bo Wallace at Ole Miss, Hackenberg at PSU, etc.).     (Least) 4. @Tennessee - this team has a lot of athleticism, but they don't play great football. They're sloppy, miss assignments, and gamble too much on both sides of the ball. Josh Dobbs is a better QB than Worley was, but their Oline is likely to again be overmatched by our pass rush, and I think that will throw Dobbs off just enough. I expect it'll be another year or two before Tennessee REALLY starts competing at the highest level, because it's still such a young team."

We were playing with the lead halfway through the 3rd, 27-14. The TCU defense clamped down, and we only got one more 1st down until the final whistle. Add on 4 turnovers committed in our territory, and it allowed for a TCU comeback, with a just under 40 yd kick as time expired, 31-30 TCU.   We've played them 3 times since we moved to the B12. 2 games went to overtime, this one came down to a game ending FG. I can't wait for the game this year."

A&M came out and punched the Razorbacks in the mouth by scoring just a minute into the game.  But the Aggies found themselves was 21-14 at the half and couldn't move the ball in the beginning of the 2nd half when they found themselves down 28-14 with just 12 minutes remaining. The A&M offense then came out and scored a quick 86 yd TD on a 2 play drive.  The Razorbacks then managed to have the game easily in hand with a first down and the ball on A&M's 31, but a botched snap and a missed FG handed A&M the ball down a score with just a few minutes left.   A&M then managed to score on another 2 play drive with a 60 yard bomb.   The game headed to OT where A&M scored a TD on the first play, and then managed to hold the Razorbacks to no gain on a 4th and 1.

CFB,3duwhr,i_fap_to_anything,2,Mon Jul 20 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"Watching that unfold live, as a Giants fan, was the single most exciting moment in sports for me.   For those unaware, the Giants got into the playoffs in the wildcard and had to beat Dallas and Green Bay who were at home (the latter in OT on a long FG). They faced the then undefeated (18-0) Patriots in the Super Bowl. This play set up the game winning TD for the Giants. It was a huge upset as the Giants were 12 point underdogs and many expected the Patriots to be the second NFL team to finish an undefeated season, the other being the 1972 Dolphins. The Giants lost to the Patriots in the final game of the regular season in a very different (higher scoring) game.  Here is a description of the play by /u/SlamDunx   I remember when Eli Manning fought off a pack of 18-0 wolves with one arm while carrying in his other arm the precious last egg of the Dodo. The wolves tried and tried to savagely destroy Eli's body and eat that egg. Eli valiantly stood his ground and, in a last ditch effort to save the species, hurled the egg to another man, also surrounded by wolves. That man, David Tyree, leapt seven feet in the air, off of one heel, that day. The pack of wolves followed him up, but Tyree snatched that precious egg (and the last hope for the species) in his hands, secured it with his beautiful head, and landed flat on his back in the middle of the vicious, rabid, starving, murderous wolves to save the Dodo.

Why do the numbers look as if they were screenprinted on like some cheap Pop Warner uniform? And of course, the tire tread ruins every uniform it comes in contact with.  I liked the uniforms they wore last year except for the random orange blobs on the sleeves.  Even though they were unpopular, they look like an all-time classic compared to this clownsuit."

The shine looks bad and as always the adidas numbers will stretch out when the players put them on.   It seems the tire-thread pattern and slashes through the stripes are Adidas' 'thing' now because UCLA has the same slashes.

We just won the Championship and 16 of our players are coming back healthy and ready to play.  4 out of 5 linemen last year started for the first time.  We only lose 1 linemen this upcoming year.  Elliot was injured the entire year last year with a broken wrist.  He now is healthy and able to run with the ball in both hands.  Braxton Miller, the player who probably gives defensive coordinators more fits than our other QB's, is coming back healthy.  Plus, even if he doesn't play QB, the other 2 are either B1G offensive player of the year and a guy who started 3 games against Wisconsin, Alabama, and Oregon and beat them all.

CFB,3durhl,the_sammyd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:58 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, does it have a cultural problem? A quick google says 16 guys have been arrested since Jimbo took over and most of them have had multiple issues with the law."
CFB,3durhl,FuckAHokie,3,Sun Jul 19 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there is a cultural problem at FSU, just some bad apples that most schools have. But after the Jameis debacle the last two years everything gets magnified a little bit more. Doesn't help that the last two are Domestic Violence, which looks bad because of Jameis and how attitudes have changed since Ray Rice. In a few years some other school will be the corrupt school that is everything wrong with college athletics"
CFB,3durhl,blackoutfish,2,Sun Jul 19 22:09:36 2015 UTC,A quick google says 16 guys have been arrested since Jimbo took over and most of them have had multiple issues with the law.   That translates to around 3 players arrested on every team. Each team has over 100 players. That's probably a lower rate than the general population.
CFB,3durhl,crazythrowa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"Well, it's hard to get a real number, but I would exclude people who would never see the field, since they were probably dismissed as soon as they displayed a bad habit or whatever (that's why nearly everyone arrested is a decent player). So that's about 185 guys, some who were around for 4 years under Fisher and some for 1. I would say it is either a statistical anomaly or it represents some kind of problem. That problem could be the culture, recruiting, local area, police department, idk."
CFB,3durhl,FuckAHokie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it's hard to get a real number, but I would exclude people who would never see the field, since they were probably dismissed as soon as they displayed a bad habit or whatever (that's why nearly everyone arrested is a decent player).   I'm not following. Why are we excluding them? If they are part of the team and there is an alleged culture problem, then wouldn't they be evidence of that?    I would say it is either a statistical anomaly or it represents some kind of problem.   Not really sure why you're concluding this. If the current statistics show a much higher rate of arrest around the target population, I don't see why we are saying there's a culture problem."
CFB,3durhl,crazythrowa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not following. Why are we excluding them?   A team has no incentive to keep potential liabilities on the team if those liabilities are not going to contribute significantly on the field. Therefore, the not-as-good players would never be part of a culture problem. These players know that to keep their spot they must behave well and the ones that don't get this are probably dismissed at the first sign of trouble (before arrest).    Not really sure why you're concluding this. If the current statistics show a much higher rate of arrest around the target population, I don't see why we are saying there's a culture problem.   That statistic would only apply if you followed each player to age 23 and then determined if the rates were similar. Quite honestly though, I would rather compare FSU to other college football teams since we're talking about whether FSU has an issue."
CFB,3durhl,FuckAHokie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"Therefore, the not-as-good players would never be part of a culture problem.   Ah, I understand your point now. But I don't think it's convincing for this reason: If players are discouraged from getting in trouble because of punishment, doesn't that directly counter the claim of a culture? If there was a culture problem, you'd expect people on the team to not be afraid of any consequences because the coaches would either not care or not find out about it.    I would rather compare FSU to other college football teams since we're talking about whether FSU has an issue.   While I'd agree, this is sort of moving the goal posts a bit. I don't buy the media pushed narrative of ""big scary _____ football players"" so the fact that most programs don't have rates higher than comparable populations makes me wonder how relevant it is to compare."

One was because my son was born and had breathing difficulty, so we were in the hospital for 8 nights (we played Pitt his last night in the hospital in the season opener).  I missed the Purdue game in 2013 because my son was in the hospital, and I missed the Northwestern State/Temple games because of my best friends bachelor party/wedding.  Make the games fun.

Not bad a for a college football team that won three games last year, and just four games over the past two years. It is also about $12 million more than Florida State received from the ACC for the past year.   That author trollin' the Noles."

CFB,3dt7kx,GerbilTamer45,-6,Sun Jul 19 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily saying that ACC, top to bottom, is better than the Big10. I just think with the metro markets we cover, similar number of top foot programs compared to the Big10, our basketball, and other successful programs, should garner a more attractive TV deal."
CFB,3dt7kx,Just_A_Gigolo,7,Sun Jul 19 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"It's not really about top football programs, per se.  It's about fan base size, location, and how attentive those fans are. The B1G schools are enormous, with huge, swollen Alumni bases just swingin' low. And are followed really intensely. Here's a good article exploring that from back in 2011.  For the sake of comparison:  B1G  ACC  EDIT* For the record, I'm not wholeheartedly endorsing the methodology used in this, but viewership numbers, and alumni size numbers also back this up. Anecdotally, the B1G schools have a tendency to be stand-alone schools in the state. Ohio State doesn't need to compete against UC nearly so much as FSU needs to compete in state against Miami and Florida. Penn State owns Pennsylvania, etc etc."
CFB,3dt7kx,PlantfoodCuisinart,2,Sun Jul 19 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you...but that chart about ACC fans, that's gotta be BS. There's no way freaking BC has more fans than FSU. I don't buy that chart for a minute.  However, you're right about the ACC. It's a crappy conference in a lot of ways, and revenue is one of them. Comparing it to the Big 10, that conference has 14 schools, 13 of which are huge, state schools with massive alumni bases that have big followings in their home states. The only private school is Northwestern.   The ACC, on the other hand, only has 7 such schools. The other 7 are either private schools, or smaller public schools without a massive following in their home state. And....of the larger state schools with massive followings...ESPN already has the state locked up with the SECN in three of them. The other 4 only cover two states.  Yeah, the ACC is screwed relative to the other conferences. I also don't think we'll ever get an ACCN. FSU should've bolted to the Big 12 and worked to make that a huge-revenue league instead of shackling itself to the anchor that is the ACC."
CFB,3dt7kx,TheCenterOfEnnui,2,Sun Jul 19 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"That is legitimately not a good article.  That is some terrible methodology, like straight up, that kind of methodology is how everyone was convinced Dewey would defeat Truman in one of the largest landslides in American history. Doesn't matter how many thousands of responses you have if you're not asking the question to the right people in the right way. Not to mention the way the numbers are interpreted leads to teams closer to larger metro areas having inflated numbers of fans, which isn't really the way college football fandom works.  Since we're on FSU lets look at some comparisons. I find it hard to believe that BC, a private school in the college crowded Boston area has more fans than FSU. I can maybe see someone like Illinois, but Iowa having 50% more fans? Sure doesn't bear out in how many people watch the games when all three programs are down and doesn't fall in line with your exclusivity theory what with Iowa State and all that. Conferences should be scrambling to pick up BC and Iowa, they're apparently worth more than Florida State as a product. Why did the Big 12 ever show an interest in FSU? They're not even in the top half of the ACC. Those ratings even a down FSU brought in, the TV channels and time slots FSU has gotten for a while and that well filled largest stadium in the ACC 150 miles away from the nearest large city don't mean anything. While we're on this ridiculous list, lets look at some other comparisons. Iowa has a bigger fanbase than any school in the PAC 12, Oklahoma State has more fans than Oregon, Rutgers would be the fourth biggest fanbase in the PAC 12.  Look, I'm not completely disagreeing with you that the Big 10 is probably worth more as a whole, but a lot of that discrepancy in the money being brought in has to be traced back to the media deal Swofford brokered, not with national brands supposedly having few fans because of this one survey.  As for fandom numbers, that's really hard to pin down. An online poll isn't going to give you very good results from a statistical standpoint. Alumni alone aren't what drive a lot of the sale and viewership, just look how many fans here didn't go to the school they root for. Best you can realistically do is get some ballpark figure with the long term viewership and merchandise sales as to how popular a team is."
CFB,3dt7kx,gruffstuff,4,Sun Jul 19 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"Check back when the Big 10 renegotiates. 12 is going to be smaller. Also - part is from hitting the title game, You were a year early on that run. Speaking of, did you suggest that the ACC should have more Raising Cane?"

CFB,3dt7kx,postposter,5,Sun Jul 19 12:02:19 2015 UTC,I agree football fans won't but it's losing the people who don't watch that will hurt espn and the conferences.  It was all fun and games tacking on money to everyone in your footprint regardless of wether or not they watched.
CFB,3dt7kx,KsigCowboy,5,Sun Jul 19 12:09:38 2015 UTC,"Wasn't thinking, you're right. ESPN being on all basic tier cable/satellite packages means lots of non-viewers were still indirectly paying for a share of it. Fewer subscribers overall means higher prices for the actual consumer.

The future of TV shows, movies, music, etc are all uncertain. Sports is not, and furthermore this is taken as a given, which is itself pretty wild.

CFB,3drrqx,MisterFalcon7,17,Sat Jul 18 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"Serious answer:  Auburn has a better running game and arguably more talent in their front seven on defense than A&M. Remember this is the SEC where people believe ""you gotta' run the damn ball"" to win.   While I know I'll get down voted to Hell and back for saying this, I believe Muschamp is a slightly better DC than Chavis and a substantially better recruiter.   I totally see your point that all the similarities are there, but I think Auburn will be slightly better than A&M while both teams excel. It'll be a fun one in College Station.  TL;DR: Auburn has a bigger jumbotron than TAMU, and therefore will play better on the field."
CFB,3drrqx,chceman,6,Sat Jul 18 22:27:00 2015 UTC,How could I have forgotten the jumbotron! This changes everything!   These are some good points. Most people seem to be saying that Muschamp is the better of the two defensive coordinators and has more talent to work with in his effort to turn around the defense.
CFB,3drrqx,MisterFalcon7,51,Sun Jul 19 02:39:01 2015 UTC,"Auburn beat a good #18 Kansas State team on the road last year, they had a tougher schedule and their 8-5 record was thus more impressive. Texas A&M's OOC schedule was four cupcakes last year, this year it gets tougher with Arizona State.  That's my guess, anyway."
CFB,3drrqx,chceman,22,Sun Jul 19 02:58:47 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I also think that Wisconsin was a harder bowl opponent than West Virginia.
CFB,3drrqx,ghetto_draco,9,Sat Jul 18 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"Kansas State though was a game that Kansas State blew, didn't they miss multiple FGs and goal line TDs?"
CFB,3drrqx,70stang,3,Sun Jul 19 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it was three field goals, with one or two of them being chip shots."
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,5,Sun Jul 19 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there was the INT thrown on the 1 yard line, missed 41 yard FG, missed 42 yard FG,  missed 22 yard FG,."
CFB,3drrqx,jschroeder01,4,Sun Jul 19 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can forgive the 42- and 42-yarders, but the 22 and going Russell Wilson on the one is pretty much what did them in."
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,4,Sun Jul 19 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"And I'm pretty sure the INT was off the hands of Tyler Lockett, one of the best receivers in Big 12 history."
CFB,3drrqx,jschroeder01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"They missed 2 field goals over 40 yards, and another that was a chip shot. We also probably could have scored again at the end of the game but kneed the ball down. With us winning by 6 points, even if they make the chip shot and the two other field goals we still probably would have won. We at least would have been able to tie it from where we were on the field with a FG of our own. However, that's how the game happens. Execution is part of winning. We should have beaten A&M, but we fucked up. We probably should have beaten Wisconsin, but we fucked up on field goals there too. It's just how the game goes."
CFB,3drrqx,OnthefarWind,20,Sun Jul 19 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.   That A&M beat Auburn point is pretty misleading as well. Auburn had an almost guaranteed OT until their center straight up fumbled the ball twice in a minute. That being said, Ole Miss basically lost due to a broken leg. It's kind of revenge karma. Either way they're 8-5."
CFB,3drrqx,ou77-am0,20,Sun Jul 19 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"TIL Nick Marshall plays center.   Auburn had them beat until   A&M took the lead with the first drive of the 2nd quarter and led a total of 54 minutes of the game.  Auburn didn't hold a lead one time the entire game and 'gave up the tie' on the next drive the two times the game was tied, one of which was the opening kick off."
CFB,3drrqx,jschroeder01,11,Sat Jul 18 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"Marshall/CAP were the cause of the first fumble, the second was Reese Dismukes snapping it for no reason. I am incorrect on saying Reese caused both but he did cause the game losing fumble.  Auburn was driving and A&M couldn't stop them in the fourth with one minute. It was very reminiscent of a fourth quarter comeback and the momentum was entirely on their side at home during the second half(21-6) however they had to make up for five touchdowns in the first half. They likely score a touchdown or go to OT if Reese doesn't snap it for no reason. Anyone watching the early parts of the drive would have put down money on Auburn to win or tie it."
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,15,Sat Jul 18 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"You don't ""have a team beat"" if you don't actually have a lead at any point in the game.  It wasn't a ""game losing fumble"", it didn't change the score, they were already losing the game.  A&M didn't score off of it, it was at the 30 yard line, and it wasn't a fumble on a play going into the end zone."
CFB,3drrqx,jschroeder01,16,Sat Jul 18 23:11:42 2015 UTC,The Nick Marshall fumble was at the one.  That was the game losing fumble imo
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,24,Sat Jul 18 23:13:18 2015 UTC,If that's a game losing fumble then the horsecollar the previous was a game losing missed call by the ref.
CFB,3drrqx,jschroeder01,-5,Sat Jul 18 23:58:05 2015 UTC,"It didn't change the score, it just resulted in a failed comeback attempt.  The game was already lost."
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,-11,Sun Jul 19 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"If a team gives up 35 points in one quarter then completely dominates them for the next 40 minutes, the perception will be that they have them beat unless they falter anytime soon, which they did. The game could have easily been an L for A&M, same as Ole Miss could have been an L for Auburn."
CFB,3drrqx,bestweekeverr,8,Sat Jul 18 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"Who the fuck gave up 35 points in one quarter?  The score over the final 40 minutes of the game was A&M 20, Auburn 24.  By what standard is that ""completely dominant”?  Did you even watch the game?"
CFB,3drrqx,Sutageito,-22,Sat Jul 18 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"It's an example. Are you dense?  When I discussed Auburn playing well it was regarding the second half, or final 30, which was 21-6."
CFB,3drrqx,1baussguy,9,Sat Jul 18 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"It's not an example, it's a straw man.  I'm saying that Auburn didn't ""have them beat"" in the A&M game and you're countering with a fictitious example saying that fictitious team did.  But you know that, that's why you went back and edited your original post I was replying to."
CFB,3drrqx,Sutageito,-16,Sat Jul 18 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"That's not a straw man. If you'd like me to clarify that one as well you can simple change ""which they did"" to ""which Auburn did"". That statement is saying that for the latter half of the game Auburn also gained momentum and dominated the second half to the point of being able to win with a minute left.  I didn't edit the original post before the first reply, Lmao. I clarified it while you wrote a reply because I realized how one sided the original statement was. I didn't get a notification on you replying until well after I edited it."
CFB,3drrqx,AUjusSauce,4,Sat Jul 18 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"Good point, but Kansas State kind of beat themselves that game."
CFB,3drrqx,Tamu_regime,-6,Sat Jul 18 23:31:20 2015 UTC,South Carolina wasn't a cupcake. People picked them to win the East before we beat them.

CFB,3drrqx,allofthelights,19,Sun Jul 19 00:17:00 2015 UTC,I keep saying Auburn is overrated going into this season..... I haven't said Texas A&M is underrated
CFB,3drrqx,smackythefrog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think we're overrated this year too. We might end up that high, but with a huge question mark at QB and coming off our worst defensive year in recent memory, I just don't see us being a preseason number 4."
CFB,3drrqx,TomBradysmom,20,Sat Jul 18 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"I do think Auburn is being overrated and Texas A&M is being underrated this season.  The main difference is Auburn won the SEC and was in the National Championship 2 years ago.  A&M has not won anything at that level since joining the SEC.    Offense - A&M brings back Kyle Allen, he played really well at the end of the year with victories over Auburn and West Virigina.  Auburn brings in Johnson who is incredibly hyped, but this is all based of 1 half vs Arkansas, who at the beginning of the season really struggled with pass defense.  Besides QB I do not really know Auburns situation but A&M is bringing 3 starting receivers, and the OL and run game hopefully will be better this year with Dave Christensen coming in.  Any Auburn fans want to chime in about the rest of your offense?  Defense - Both teams were bad last year as you mentioned, but both teams also bring back a strong DL with Myles Garrett for A&M and Carl Larson for Auburn as elite pass rushers.  Again not sure about the secondary or LBs for Auburn but A&M is in a better postition this year than last year with Armani Watts being a second year started and JUCO safety Justin Evans coming in.  I think both Muschamp and Chavis will make their respective defenses better, and with how many points each offense scores, they don't have to be much better to be competitive for a SEC championship.  To me the situations is very similar, and most Aggies I've talked to are fine being under the radar this season.  I do think A&M beats Auburn this year.  We have had their number the past 3 years, if Johnny didn't go out for a couple drives we might be 3-0 over Auburn, but then you can say the same thing for them with the awkward fumbles last year.   It should be a really good game November 7th, and it will be interesting to see whose defense is going to be most improved by Muschamp and Chavis.  And what the media says now honestly doesn't matter, all that matters is who wins coming Fall.  Edit: Formatting"
CFB,3drrqx,smackythefrog,17,Sun Jul 19 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Just to build off this a bit, we are returning two solid players that missed all of last season yet were...solid...two seasons ago in 2013. Alex Kozan on the OLine and Lawson at DE.   It was tough enough losing such a great OL in Greg Robinson after 2013. But to lose another veteran OL? I think that definitely affected our run game. To what degree, I don't think anyone can say, but it certainly hurt.   Lawson was kicking ass a true freshman in 2013. He was invaluable, and it was shitty that his torn ACL news came during our spring game last year, about 3 months after the NCG. A surprising blow. But he too was integral to our somewhat-of-a-defense in 2013, especially in relation to our atrocious defense in 2014.   Returning these two guys is huge for us. It can only improve this team that went 8-5 last year. Losing big pieces like CAP and Marshall and even Dismukes hurts, but I feel like anything can happen on offense, especially with someone as wise as Malzahn. Defense is always a tricky issue, and we're returning Lawson and also have a potential freshman starter in the #1 DE in Byron Cowart, it's hard not to be optimistic about the Achilles' Heel of our team last year.   People are high on WR Duke Williams, too. I feel he can only get better as well which is scary because he was already turning heads in the few games he played last year (injuries, bowl game suspension).   The biggest question mark is in JJ. Homers think his two starts mean everything and the cynics and/or haters think those games don't mean shit. My approach to him, strictly for the preseason, is that he will be somewhere in the middle. He has a solid veteran WR in Duke and those two are kind of joined at the hip as far as their success goes, for obvious reasons. I don't expect our run game to be weak, but with someone that's a better passer than Marshall in Jeremy Johnson, the team should be a lot less one-dimensional than we were in the past.   Now, I'm just making a case for Auburn and not against ATM. It was just yesterday I got bored and ate ice cream and watched the ATM-WVU bowl game. You guys have a lot to be excited about in Kyle Allen. Returning a QB is a huge plus for any team. I am not familiar with the rest after Josh Reynolds and Noil but there's always room for surprises.   I just think returning two big pieces from our 2013 team that was so successful but were hurt all of last year spurs more optimism, assuming they return the same or better than before. Throw in the optimism around Jeremy Johnson being a breath of fresh air for a team that hasn't really had as promising of a play-caller in nearly a decade (Jason Campbell) and I think the preseason hype is warranted for Auburn. Win the conference? Eh, we'll see. Good chance to get 10 wins, at least? God I hope so."
CFB,3drrqx,WhenIntegralsAttack,12,Sat Jul 18 22:00:55 2015 UTC,People keep talking about JJ and Muschamp being the keys this season...but two of our best linemen on both sides of the ball in 2013 coming back from injury after missing all of last season is significant. Very very significant.
CFB,3drrqx,AeroAg,5,Sat Jul 18 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I glazed over Muschamp there. Obviously he will be key in calling the plays on defense, which should definitely be a step up from years past, but I also hear the argument that he needs to recruit his own players and coach them up. Which may take another recruiting cycle or two.   Still, any DC should be able to make the best of their situation and Auburn hasn't been too shabby in recruiting defensively either."
CFB,3drrqx,polydorr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:45 2015 UTC,Do yall think muschamp is gonna stay long enough? A lot of people last (I felt like) thought he was just gonna stay 2-3 seasons and then jump ship to the next head coaching position. I could be totally wrong though
CFB,3drrqx,MohnJaddenLunar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"No idea how long he stays and it depends a lot on how Auburn does.   I'm sure many Auburn fans try not to think about that scenario too much. But he's no Kirby Smart that hangs around for nearly a decade with the same team, same position."
CFB,3drrqx,ou77-am0,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:19 2015 UTC,Another thing keeping Muschamp at Auburn will be the ability to learn some new offensive schemes under Gus. I'd say he sticks around for four years or so and then tries his hand at head coaching again.
CFB,3drrqx,DX_Legend,3,Sun Jul 19 16:58:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response!  Can't wait to go to Auburn in 2016 for the game!
CFB,3drrqx,Souldier,5,Sun Jul 19 17:54:36 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this assessment. I think TAMU is due for a solid rebound. Like Auburn, they need a good defensive identity; after that, things will fall into place. TAMU has as good of a QB corps and WR corps as any team, anywhere. Not to mention elite offensive lines year after year. Though it's worth mentioning most teams don't fear TAMU's run game.   Any Auburn fans want to chime in about the rest of your offense?   Elite, but they were last year as well (most of the time).  Exchange our LB situation for your secondary one.   I do think A&M beats Auburn this year.    I believe this as well pending a look at our first few games. TAMU just attacks too many of our weaknesses head on and they always play better at home. It will be close."
CFB,3drrqx,AU_Boof,7,Sun Jul 19 02:58:33 2015 UTC,We actually play much better on the road
CFB,3drrqx,ratbastrd05,5,Sun Jul 19 00:54:38 2015 UTC,The run game question under Christensen is one of the biggest questions.

CFB,3drrqx,70stang,4,Sun Jul 19 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion, or defense lost every game for us besides UGA. if we have even a half decent defense this season and our offense goes off like it has been, I think we are a contender for a title. Tamu seemed to have consistancy issues last year, and changing QBs mid season probably looks bad on paper. I think we should have the better year this season, but I'm expecting both of us to be on the same level the season after that."
CFB,3drrqx,Working_onit,4,Sun Jul 19 21:56:58 2015 UTC,I only disagree because in the Miss State game we spotted them 14-0 due to turnovers by the offense and while the defense should have stopped them it was just as much the offenses fault.
CFB,3drrqx,UF0118,3,Sat Jul 18 21:48:10 2015 UTC,Iron Bowl was also largely on the offense... early Roc Thomas turnover and so many squandered red zone chances.  Obviously we gave up way too many points but the offense had their shot.
CFB,3drrqx,Just_A_Gigolo,2,Sun Jul 19 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"That is true, red zone was atrocious which is crazy because it was a stength all year. Though I never expect a team to win a game giving up 55 points."
CFB,3drrqx,Lucifersamtaco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the buck has to stop somewhere. For us, it landed in front of Ellis Johnson. Sure, we struggled with mistakes/penalties/fumbles on offense (for a lot of the season, actually), but anyone saying the offense lost the game after scoring 44 points is wrong. We aren't playing basketball, scoring 44 points anyone should be enough to win unless... The defense is atrocious. Which it was. It was seriously one of our worst defenses ever (statistically speaking), and the fact that we finished with 8 wins and had a serious shot at 2 others (A&M, Wisconsin) reflects very highly on our offense."
CFB,3drrqx,Just_A_Gigolo,3,Sun Jul 19 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"I mean if our consistency issues revolved around a qb who isn't on the team anymore, is that really something people choose to hold against us going forward?"
CFB,3drrqx,Lucifersamtaco,7,Sun Jul 19 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"Looking at the depth charts, it seems like Auburn is extremely experienced on both starting lineups, with fewer holes in that than A&M. Their 2 deep looks similar to MSST from last year, with far more talent across the DL"

CFB,3drrqx,bigwhiskey91,3,Sat Jul 18 22:11:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, while Auburn is expected to win the SEC we won't win the SEC West man haha. Seriously though for my opinion on Auburn I believe it has to do with the experience that we have and while Jeremy Johnson hasn't started a lot of games he has at least played in multiple SEC games and always seemed to look poised and relaxed and had a great touch. While we lost a lot of players they are all being replaced by players that started a couple of games before or has game experience. With Auburn I believe the Offense will speak for its self we will be able to score. Defensively we just need to be able to make a stop which to me it felt like we could not do at all also that gap of 9th and 14th is a big difference and both teams will be better for sure but I don't know much about AM so I can't speak on them."
CFB,3drrqx,deathdonut,3,Sun Jul 19 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"They run high tempo offenses with spread formations, but they are very, very different in how the move the ball, schemes, and play calling.  Texas A&M is an Air Raid team with a rather minimal running game; throw quick passes and quick screens to stretch the defense and move in small chunks, then throw deep when the coverage tightens, or run if the defense is too stretched out. Auburn is all about pounding the ball when they can.  The run power, zone read, jet, and really, about as close to you get to a Wing-T out of all the P5 schools in my opinion (buck sweep, trap, jet, etc)."
CFB,3drrqx,UF0118,3,Sun Jul 19 00:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are in for a surprise this year. Gus doesn't have one type of offense, he builds around what he has. When he was at Tulsa he had (at the time) the second best scoring offense of all time with a 5000 yard passer, 3 different >1000 yard receivers, and a >1000 yard RB. I don't think we'll swap to Air Raid or anything, but I think you'll see us pass a lot more out of the zone read."

CFB,3drrqx,Working_onit,3,Sun Jul 19 06:08:17 2015 UTC,"I think it is alittle bit of both. Sure Auburn is getting alot of hype despite our record last year, but I think heading into the A&M game in 2014, Auburn had alot of steam and came out flat in the first half. Losing that game was a massive blow to our season. It is like the checked out after that because there was ""nothing to play for"". The reason why Auburn fans are hyping Muschamp so much is because of his energy he brings over CEJ. That and Auburn is returning Lawson (DE) and Kozan (OG). Those guys were key in the 2013 season."
CFB,3drrqx,AU_Boof,6,Sun Jul 19 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"A&M's going to have a run game this year. Auburn is going to have a secondary this year.   A&M has a good starting 5 on their D-Line, but is missing depth.  I honestly don't know about Auburn's depth."

CFB,3drrqx,BRISKET_PLS,3,Sun Jul 19 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"Well, we had a secondary last year but no pass rush. Even the best secondary gets exposed if the QB has all day to work. We have our main pass rusher back this year.  That's going to make the difference in our pass defense. TBH, we have very little quality depth in secondary. Our starters are looking scary, though."
CFB,3drrqx,sparkreason,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:47:55 2015 UTC,Our dline depth isn't lacking...  We are 3 or 4 deep across the whole line...  Auburn's secondary is in similar shape as ours.

CFB,3drrqx,64voxac30,3,Sat Jul 18 22:51:08 2015 UTC,I disagree about safety. J.Ford is solid and Trey Matthews looked like an All American in the spring game and yes its the spring game but his play at UGA was not bad at all.

I do believe he will get the most out of what he has.  However, I expect The offense under Jeremy Johnson will make up for this.  He's not the homerun threat that Marshall was, but the short to mid-range passing game should be improved and more consistent.  Johnson has a very high ceiling."
CFB,3drrqx,gandalfblue,3,Sun Jul 19 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but while Muschamp's immediate impact is being pretty overrated, but it shouldn't be written off.

Not saying we will have a top of the line defense but I don't think we will be giving up as many points as last year."
CFB,3drrqx,wompratT-16,3,Sat Jul 18 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"I think Muschamp will be good for 7-10 less points, and the return of Lawson is huge."

Auburn has, contrary to recent preference, some pretty serious talent back there. If they are quick to pick up the schemes and none of the secondary gets hurt (we are so thin there) they could be in the top half of the SEC. We just need the defense to produce two more stops per game to win with the offense.  But again, who knows with injuries and if Muschamp can turn it around quickly. The good news is we were so bad on D last year, so it shouldn't take much to show improvement. The bad news is we were so bad on D last year, so we have a long way to go."

CFB,3drrqx,lostmyfingpassword,6,Sun Jul 19 01:21:31 2015 UTC,NFL QB talent=|= College QB talent. Comparing the two is meaningless
CFB,3drrqx,UhOhOreo2012,-2,Sun Jul 19 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"That just isn't true, talent is talent. It would be correct to say that NFL QB success=|= College QB success, because you can get by on athleticism in college. The point I was trying to make is that it's hardly inspiring as a QB to lose the starting job to an athlete."
CFB,3drrqx,lostmyfingpassword,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Marshall had a unique skill set in that he had a huge arm, if not always the best passer, and could run as fast as a DB with the shiftiness of a RB. I would imagine that Gus figured he would have better success in the short term if he essentially ran the ball all the time and didn't have to rely on a true freshman QB. Now Johnson has had two years of development, and has actually played in (and started) games.  JJ wasn't second string because he was a worse QB, he was second string because Marshall was at best a crazy home run threat with the ball in his hands, and at worst a JUCO player that was the interim QB while Gus got things up and running in his first couple years."

I bet you that it's much lower than a mediocre 6'5 college quarterback , who throws for 2000, making a roster. Why? Intangibles and potential.  NFL Quarterbacks are completely different than College ones. There's a reason that guys who would backup other quarterbacks in college end up having better professional careers than the guys they actually backed up."

The game changes drastically, but the QB isn't any more or less talented as a result of the change, the necessary skills just change."
CFB,3drrqx,Kovoti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"There were most certainly other things at play, notably the desire for offensive continuity under Marshall. Sorry, 'backing up a Jags DB' is a very poor assessment and a little derogatory."

Not trying to disrespect either, but if Johnson's talent was as immense as people are saying then you can't help but wonder why an athlete playing QB was leading the team to an 8-5 record instead of him."
CFB,3drrqx,USMCFieldMP,2,Sat Jul 18 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"A) because Marshall had a very unique helmsmanship of the offense that gave defenses FITS in 2013 while Johnson was just a freshman  B) because Marshall had more experience and had in fact led his team to a championship, in case you forgot.  It's really not that hard. OSU has the same problem, albeit with more overall talent."

CFB,3dsgqp,6heismans,12,Sun Jul 19 01:11:31 2015 UTC,Interesting that Bo's two worst games last year were against LSU and TCU. Both teams use a 4-2-5.
CFB,3dsgqp,Chad_Maximum,8,Sun Jul 19 01:17:23 2015 UTC,Then look at Baylor and TCU- both 4-2-5 teams- and they absolutely torched each other. Has to have something to do with Petty and Boykin being familiar with the defense.
CFB,3dsgqp,DeinHeld,4,Sun Jul 19 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"TCU plays very aggressively on defense, forcing opponents to beat them deep. That's why Baylor was able to kill it on offense. Nobody else throws the deep ball that well (which is unsurprising, given the weapons at WR)."
CFB,3dsgqp,UnreconciledAccounts,3,Sun Jul 19 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"I would argue the run game is what saved us late. Sure the deep ball helped, but Shock and the Line put us on their back and carried us to victory."
CFB,3dsgqp,DeinHeld,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the run game did really come on late, but I think that was due to the defense trying to adjust to the deep balls. That (clearly) didn't work too well so the defense basically just wasn't working at all when that happened."
CFB,3dsgqp,UnreconciledAccounts,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:12 2015 UTC,Fair point. Looking at the stats would support that. I based my opinion solely on my own personal account. I did watch it with my biases.

CFB,3dsgqp,mahout13,5,Sun Jul 19 03:05:04 2015 UTC,Ole Miss was a different team after the Auburn loss.  I was astounded that they were somehow able to beat Miss St. after losing to Arkansas 30-0 the previous week.
CFB,3dsgqp,northlamar,8,Sun Jul 19 01:55:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we shouldn't have been playing in that game to begin with. Treadwell was the absolute key to the offense, with him out, well, you see what happened against Arkansas, LSU, and TCU. We only beat State because Dan Mullen is arrogant and stubborn. He thought he had a legitimate playoff team and could just beat us with brute force. When his gameplan wasn't working he didn't adjust, he doubled down. They could have easily beaten us had they just watched film of Arkansas and LSU and did what they did.   So we snuck into the Peach Bowl on the strength of a win in a game that, had we been playing against a different coach, we probably would have lost. On top of that, you had us playing TCU who probably should have been in national title contention.  So you had a team that, while very good to start the season, was an average (at best) team to end it playing against a team that possibly could have won the national championship. It shouldn't have been a surprise that we got destroyed."
CFB,3dsgqp,kaizerizan,3,Sun Jul 19 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"I love Dan and what he is doing with our program but Holy. Shit. that is one stubborn ass...  You hit the nail on the head.  I don't even think we had a game plan for the Golden Egg Game.  But, Dan is one of the worst at in-game adjustments, so even if we did, it sucked and we didn't deviate from running Dak up the middle."

Not sure if either of those are true.  Then there's the Harbaugh factor.  I'm thinking people greatly overrate his coming impact at Michigan, especially in season one, but I'm not surprised when people say, ""Oh, Harbaugh's gonna turn this around in a hurry,"" even if I think they're wrong."

CFB,3dtk9z,RheagarTargaryen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:49:30 2015 UTC,"Prior to Harbaugh Stanford couldn't get out of its own way going 4-7, 4-7, 5-6, 1-11. Within 3 years they went 8-5 and lost to Oklahoma in the Sun Bowl. The next year they went 12-1 and almost went to the Natty. And we're talking about a Stanford team that was probably as talented as Vanderbilt prior to Harbaugh coming in. Now take a Michigan team that actually has a pulse talent wise and you can see why some people might hedge their bets."

Treadwell's almost TD is still one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen. Sugar Bowl: This is more important than the Cotton Bowl, and was a FAR superior game. One of the best played games I've seen. Cotton Bowl: Insane comeback, fat guy TDs, blocked kicks, this hit; this game was the most entertaining game of the bunch. However, it goes lower because it didn't mean much in the grand scheme, and it was fundamentally a poorly played game (neither MSU nor Baylor played particularly well). FSU-ND: This game is the clear clunker of the bunch if you can call one that. Watching it was exciting, and a helluva ending, but you never thought that ND or FSU was really a competitor this year."

CFB,3dt4c2,AU_Boof,8,Sun Jul 19 05:22:41 2015 UTC,We got our own medical school now - with colonoscopies and hookers and blackjack.
CFB,3dt4c2,who_dat_who_der,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"I heard they are like this with most of their post-graduate programs. If that is true, that's a pretty scummy system."
CFB,3dt4c2,codesius,4,Sun Jul 19 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common at a lot of places. There's this thing in academia known as ""the inbred scholar."" If you get all your degrees from one place, you won't be exposed to a variety of researchers and approaches, and this will make it harder to find employment.  EDIT: This is more applicable to PhD programs than MA, MS, MBA, JD, MD, etc."
CFB,3dt4c2,Husky_In_Exile,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"That's a good theory. I don't believe that's primarily why they turn down their own undergraduates though. I personally believe that these schools want more out of state students because they generally have to pay more. I'm sure having different perspectives and schools would add to diversity, good point."
CFB,3dt4c2,codesius,4,Sun Jul 19 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that these schools want more out of state students because they generally have to pay more.   That's a good point, I didn't even think of that. This seems especially true for JD and MD programs.  But PhD programs typically offer their students full scholarship, and there are some private schools who also abide by this rule (IIRC, U of Chicago Law).  And I know that at Washington, in-state students are more likely to get into the dentistry or medical schools, although that may be a requirement of the Washington State Legislature."

CFB,3drzdk,kingcal,3,Sat Jul 18 23:53:06 2015 UTC,Nice grab by Japan.
CFB,3drzdk,SirNuke,3,Sat Jul 18 23:52:24 2015 UTC,Can't help to think this would be more interesting (and far more competitive) with different rules than college/NFL football.  Maybe something closer to sprint football?
CFB,3drzdk,saladbar,4,Sat Jul 18 23:52:23 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in the bronze medal game thread but my solution would be to break up team USA into teams for individual states. Maybe even teams for each US territory. Half the field can be US states and the other half other countries.   Then between IFAF tournaments we can have a huge states-only tournament, much like soccer has confederation cups like the Gold Cup, Copa América or the UEFA Euro tournaments."
CFB,3drzdk,MadeUAcctButIEatedIt,3,Sun Jul 19 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"When you say ""states-only,"" do you mean like Australia's interstate competitions?  Wouldn't Texas win it every year?"
CFB,3drzdk,saladbar,3,Sun Jul 19 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think California, Florida and Ohio would put up good fights too."
CFB,3drzdk,SirNuke,4,Sun Jul 19 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"That'd help, though I don't think I'd bet against a fully armed and operational Holy Texan Republic of Texas Football Order of Football.  The problem I see is Japan has a modestly robust American football scene, and has clearly put together a Team.  They've been trained, they've got some talent, and they're playing well.  I think this is the peak of what we can expect from any other teams, minus probably Canada.  And this game is a bloodbath, despite the US team being intentionally hampered (could Dan Hawkins even get a college job anymore if he wanted one?) and not playing all that motivated.  If American football is going to be taken seriously as an international sport, there's going to have to be some changes to better enable everybody else.  I was personally thinking along the lines of sprint football, since it would reduce the necessity of big o & d linemen."

CFB,3drzdk,bearsnchairs,3,Sat Jul 18 23:47:30 2015 UTC,Fumble 6!
CFB,3drzdk,LegacyZebra,5,Sat Jul 18 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"Well, that was poor bean bag mechanics on the 2 pt. play. No need to ever drop a bean bag in the end zone unless you're dealing with a punt.   Edit: A punt or a fumble by the defense in it's own end zone to be fully correct."
CFB,3drzdk,hythloday1,2,Sat Jul 18 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Why would you need to mark it under any circumstances?  If it's to denote the point of possession change (for forward progress purposes I guess?) and the endzone is undifferentiated, why would you mark it under punts or defensive fumbles but not offensive fumbles?"
CFB,3drzdk,LegacyZebra,4,Sat Jul 18 23:51:56 2015 UTC,"A bean bag is generally used for penalty enforcement. Penalties for fouls during a fumble are penalized using the spot of the fumble. So if a team intercepts a pass and then fumbles from their own end zone, a bean bag would go down in the end zone for penalty enforcement purposes. For punts, it could be to mark illegal touching in the end zone which would result in a touch back if accepted. Or if the receiving team for some reason caught or recovered a punt in their own end zone a bean bag would be dropped to mark the end of the kick since the end of a scrimmage kick is also a possible penalty enforcement spot."
CFB,3drzdk,bearsnchairs,3,Sun Jul 19 00:01:25 2015 UTC,Why are we still going for 2?
CFB,3drzdk,diagonalfish,8,Sat Jul 18 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"Dan Hawkins is having flashbacks to a bad experience in a sushi restaurant, or something, and is out for revenge."

CFB,3drzdk,1ncognito,4,Sat Jul 18 23:41:04 2015 UTC,These announcers are rough
CFB,3drzdk,1ncognito,4,Sat Jul 18 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference in seeing here is just how dominant the USA is on the lines, they've got a killer size advantage."

CFB,3drzdk,1ncognito,3,Sat Jul 18 23:58:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously doubt it. He's looked decent, but no better than any number of college punters every season. He just stands out based on the comparative talent on his team."

The first offense (when the 2 pt try was shut down) is free, but the second time is an unsportsmanlike conduct foul."
CFB,3drzdk,hythloday1,4,Sat Jul 18 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"You mean after the offense has substituted, right?  There's no obligation to wait for the defense to match up if the offense doesn't sub?"
CFB,3drzdk,LegacyZebra,5,Sat Jul 18 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"Right.  Offense subs, defense tries to sub but the offense snaps the ball before the defense is set--> Foul  Offense doesn't sub--> Defense is on it's own for substitutions."

Chad President (QB): Decommitted because of 2 factors, our OC ( who was his lead recruiter ) leaving for a HC job and Jarret Stidham jumping on board, he later committed to Tulsa, where our OC is now HC.  Ronnie Major (OL): Flipped to Texas ( did he make it in in the end? i know it was reported he was struggling academically )  KeShawn Somerville (CB): Was likely just using our offer as a holding offer until he flipped to TCU, it happens occasionally, sadly  Jordan Elliot (DT): His recruiting process seems weird, hes committed to Houston now i think, released a top 10 several weeks ago that BU wasnt in, but this week, he now says hes taking an OV ( Which you can only take 5 of ) to BU, which indicates we must be in his top 5 somewhere youd think? :D  TrenDavian Dickson (WR): A Shame he decomitted, but BU will always be fine for WR"

CFB,3dr2fz,Just_A_Gigolo,11,Sat Jul 18 20:08:07 2015 UTC,"The offense? Financial-aid violations. The Pioneer Football League, a football-only conference made up of 11 schools does not allow for football scholarships to be awarded. The Pioneer Football League says Jacksonville inappropriately dispersed financial aid to players, although an internal review by the university and the league found no NCAA violations.   That explains why it is a conference punishment.  I'm curious to see the details of this, if possible, and see if it applies to other programs or conferences.  From what I understand, the Ivy League schools often give generous financial aid packages to athletes and have somewhat lower standards of acceptance rates.  Would those constitute as inappropriate financial aid?  What makes it appropriate or inappropriate?"
CFB,3dr2fz,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,9,Sat Jul 18 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"Well the vacated wins only apply to their conference games so I assume this was something very particular to how Pioneer Football League teams are supposed to operate. Unlike the Ivy League, they allow scholarships in other sports (hence they're a football-only conference), from what I understand the conference was created after the NCAA made its members put all their athletic departments on the same level--the schools that wanted to keep a non-scholarship football team formed the Pioneer Football League to have a D1 football conference which also explains the conference's giant footprint.   EDIT: It also underlines how good of a job Harbaugh did at San Diego--I remember when Stanford hired him, seemed like a perfect fit: someone who could take them to back-to-back 11-1 seasons given the lack of advantages (USD is a gorgeous campus on a hill but it's tiny). Of course, no one realized how good he was going to be given the extra boost of Stanford's facilities."
CFB,3dr2fz,bakonydraco,2,Sat Jul 18 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"San Diego also got hit for the same infraction a few years ago. It blows my mind that they compete in a league with a set of rules, but they don't allow their members to play by those rules. The Patriot League is a good example of a league that used to be non-scholarship that is now (except Georgetown), and even the Ivy League has more than half their players (and all students) on some form of financial aid."
CFB,3dr2fz,GiveMeSomeRaptorNews,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  It looks like teams in the Pioneer Football League are also eligible for FCS Playoff invitations - would JU be eligible to accept an invitation as an at-large if they run the table, or would the ban also prevent them from doing so?  Because it sounds like the PFL has little authority over what teams do in NCAA or inter conference play unless bids are given to the leagues to decide how they distribute them."
CFB,3dr2fz,PureCFR,6,Sat Jul 18 19:23:50 2015 UTC,A Pioneer League at-large bid would be extremely unlikely.

CFB,3dr2fz,TDenverFan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I think a PFL team had one loss (Or maybe even ran the table) a few years back (Before the champion got the auto-bid) and they did not get a playoff bid.  Edit: It's actually not uncommon for a 1 loss team to win the PFL, but the conference has never gotten any at large playoff bids. Last time it happened was 2010 Jacksonville, but their ne loss was a 45-3 shellacking by Appalacian State, who was their only full scholarship FCS opponent."
CFB,3dr2fz,FSBlueApocalypse,2,Sun Jul 19 02:07:22 2015 UTC,The scandal broke out right before JU's last home game and had they won they would've received the PFL's playoff bid.

Though, the PFL is a one bid league, so there's a good chance this doesn't really affect (effect?) anything."

CFB,3dssle,kingcal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"I know oversigning sucks, but you have to admit that teams have pretty strong incentive not to undersign.  For instance, if you graduate 15 seniors and only sign 15 incoming freshman, but then suddenly due to injury, academic or legal issues, etc... you lose another 3 players, you're only at 82 scholarship athletes.   I suppose you can argue that coaches should be well-informed enough to account for these while recruiting or that they can grant walk-ons a well-earned scholarship, but I still think that most coaches would hedge their bets on the incoming class a bit so to speak just to cover their asses.  I'm not defending over-signing or processing players out because they haven't lived up to their hype to make room for a younger kid. I don't know what the solution is."

Many times the issue that causes teams to over sign is having more commits than they expect, because teams offer far more scholarships than they can give out if every one is accepted"

For those unaware, this is a run-through of the game, and things UF did that made me shake my head.  They scored on the opening kickoff return in the first half, our first punt to them in the second half, a fumble return, an interception return, and off of a 20 yard drive they got from us throwing an interception. In the game UF had 3 interceptions and 3 fumbles, and missed our PAT on one of our two late game touchdowns. I think people booed every time Driskel came on the field (at least until those kinds of fans left in the 3rd quarter) and we similarly got a fire muschamp chant."

I've been an MSU fan my whole life and saw some absolutely schizo games, but none of them even touch the complete absurdity of that UGA GT game.  So many dramatic plays, I'll list a few:   when the refs let UGA hold JT up at the goal line for several seconds, not calling either forward progress or a TD and UGA ran it back 100 yards for a TD Two forced and recovered goal line fumbles by GT That semi-squib kickoff where UGA didn't realize they had to pick up the ball to get possession, a GT guy pounced on it, and we recovered our own fucking kickoff thirty yards away from a TD Right after the recovered kickoff, JT dropped a pump fake and it was reviewed and called a fumble that UGA recovered, this was deep in the fourth quarter with UGA down by 4 Earlier in the game there was that UGA fake FG where they used a blatant hold to run it to like the three yard line, and were then held to a FG Richt ridiculously calling for a squib kick with like 20 seconds left that we returned to the 40, followed by a JT scramble to their 35 edit: Richt calling timeout while we scrambled to organize the last second FG.  the tying 54 field goal as time expired barely squeaking past the cross bar UGA blocking the extra point (because the refs were letting them bull rush the snapper) after we scored first in OT the GT interception to seal it   Unbelievable game.

Who the fuck ices a kicker over getting a delay of game into a 58 yarder? Although with the way that game went, that extra length just means that the ball would've somehow ricocheted off a UGA lineman's fingertips in just the right way to accelerate it .5% where it would then gain some transverse rotational momentum to ricochet off the left crossbar, change its rotation orientation from clockwise to counterclockwise, where it would then deflect off the right crossbar, and then quantum tunnel into an orbit around the center of the goalpost (scoring on its first trip through), an orbit that, left untouched, would remain stable until the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way decayed due to Hawking Radiation.

CFB,3drx8z,yankee_rebel,6,Sun Jul 19 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"homer time, Ole miss v. Bama easily the best game I've ever attended/watched in my life. Alternatively Ga v. Ga tech game was a great game to watch last year too."
CFB,3drx8z,happysadfaced,11,Sat Jul 18 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"Baylor/Michigan State was the best game I watched as a neutral.   The most excited I got all year for a game that wasn't a Clemson game was the OSU/Bama game. A lot of that was the playoff aspect though.  Based on actual gameplay, the best for me was Baylor/MSU."

CFB,3drx8z,StraightRidahs,11,Sat Jul 18 21:56:15 2015 UTC,Baylor/MSU and GT-Georgia for sure in the top 10.  GT-VT was an underrated game that should at least be a darkhorse for the top 25.
CFB,3drx8z,hirolord,3,Sat Jul 18 22:42:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with GT-VT personally. It was close and had some clutch moments, but overall it was pretty ugly."
CFB,3drx8z,StraightRidahs,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yes that's why it's on the fringe of the top 25 for me, but really after the top 15, how many of them are really going to be very well-played games? GT-VT had a ton of drama, featured an out of nowhere comeback by a team stereotyped as being a bad comeback team, and was consequential in the ACC coastal. Just throwing a number out there, I'd guess it deserves to be about #22."

CFB,3drx8z,Metaboss84,3,Sun Jul 19 11:13:58 2015 UTC,"The ASU games to consider would be ASU/Utah; ASU/USC. While we had other good games, I think these would be the only ones on our schedule worth considering over the many, many, many great games last season.  Just a quick reminder of what was going on in those games:  ASU/Utah: This was a late season matchup between two teams looking to earn a spot in the PAC12 championship game. The scenario was a bit complicated, as neither team was going to be eliminated if they lost, but the winner would control their own destiny going forward. ASU controlled the game for most of the time, but as the second half continued, Utah managed to take the lead and stifle the explosive ASU offence. But as time ran out, the ASU stars made plays to earn a field goal to send the game into overtime. There, the great Utah Kicker had an extremely rare miss, which wasn't matched when ASU kicked the game winner.  ASU/USC: ASU had just come off an embarrasing blowout loss at home to USC's bitter rival, UCLA. A second loss in a row could spell doom to the devils' PAC12 championship hopes, and ASU was forced to start their backup QB, who looked alright against UCLA, but his inexperience lead to easy defensive TD's, dooming the Devils in that game. On the other hand, USC had been inconsistent, looking like they could beat Alabama, then lose the next game against Kansas. In the game, USC held the Devils in check, getting a score on special teams as well. However, as the game reached its conclusion, ASU mounted one of the most insane comebacks in Sun Devil History.  (note that I'm not trying to write an entry for the top 25, just reminding people of what happened.)"

In fact, I hardly ever seen anyone who is obviously overweight or not fit. http://www.annarbor.com/news/college-costs/  Agriculture programs are geared toward the farming and food industry. That's why U of Nebraska also has a very big agriculture program. Uofm doesn't offer MSU degrees such as crop and soil sciences, horticulture, animal science, entomology, food industry management, landscape architecture, and sustainable parks, recreation and tourism. Having such a big agriculture program means that it attracts people who are interested in those fields. MSU is very respected in the farming industry. Most people I know in rural areas are fans of MSU. West and northern michigan have a heavy MSU fanbase."

This deal was signed a year ago and for what other schools were getting, it was pretty competitive and more than double MSU's previous contract. It's not that our contract is small, it's that Michigan's is insanely large, moreso than other schools with similar brand value. I think the UM deal is going to get other schools more money in the future since the precedent is set, including MSU."
CFB,3dqn72,MorsMiles,56,Sat Jul 18 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"From an MSU board, a poster that works at Nike..   ""Jesus Christ people. The Detroit News has left out some key facts to the story and I can't believe you are all reading right into their bullshit ""story"".  Let's a get few things straight. This deal was written in July 2014.  In July 2014, Nike was paying Florida State $4.5m/year, Ohio State $4.2m/year, Tennesee inked a deal that month for $4m/year. So when Hollis got a deal for $3.4m/year, up from $1.2m/year, that was a solid move.  Nobody can argue that Michigan State is of higher value than any of those three schools and to be right up there with them was impressive. Remember value includes sales, Tennesee's following is much larger than Michigan State's.  Now, if you want to compare it to Michigan's $11.2m/year, you just don't understand that a year has clearly made a difference in the amount of money Nike is willing to spend. If Hollis was signing a deal right now and only got $3.4m/year, I'd agree it was a bad deal but he didn't. He signed it a year ago. Come on people use your brains."""

CFB,3dqc6m,bigstu_89,4,Sat Jul 18 14:27:57 2015 UTC,I think it's the fabric. It has to be some kind of special cut or performance thing. I would hope they wouldn't just do that for aesthetics.

CFB,3drjg2,Stuppyhead,2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:19 2015 UTC,Weird that people want to go somewhere they feel that they might have better opportunities or don't want to be stuck in the state for 3-4 more years or weren't even scouted by Tennessee in the first place.
CFB,3drjg2,VolSoHard,6,Sat Jul 18 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously not every kid in Tennessee is gonna go to Tennessee, but still, Butch gets 90 percent of the kids he recruits. Despite that the crystal ball had Bituli going to Ole Miss for the longest time (Auburn was actually his other finalist). You'd think after what happened with Josh Malone, Drew Richmond, Kyle Phillips, Jalen Hurd, etc etc Tennessee would get a little more respect when it comes to picking where the elite talent goes."
CFB,3drjg2,srs_house,2,Sat Jul 18 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting this 90% number?  I doubt Saban even gets that high of a percentage.  For example, he wanted LB Tre Lamar and he just committed to Clemson over Bama and Auburn."
CFB,3drjg2,NOTPattyBarr,6,Sat Jul 18 22:56:12 2015 UTC,I think he might have meant 90% of in state prospects that have Tennessee offers from Butch Jones end up at Tennessee.
CFB,3drjg2,iclimbnaked,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:52:43 2015 UTC,Which still wouldn't be accurate. Butch went 65% at best in-state this year.
CFB,3drjg2,srs_house,4,Sun Jul 19 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"I think he's exaggerating. But over the last few classes, Butch has only missed one or two of the top 8 recruits in TN. If he'd been at Tennessee a year longer, we likely would have landed Jalen Ramsey AND Von Belle. He's really good at recruiting kids from Tennessee."
CFB,3drjg2,UCF_Chris,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:04:44 2015 UTC,If wed had any one but dooley we would have got Von Belle. He grew up a huge Tennessee Fan. He wanted to go to Tennessee. We just showed zero interest while Dooley was here.

CFB,3dru9w,Sh-tstirrer,6,Sat Jul 18 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"He'd have been a good get. I think after a redshirt year and another one in S&C/scout team he'll be pretty damn good. Looks like a guy that takes coaching well with a high ceiling. I know he was on our board. Rutgers fans are certainly bitter about losing out on prospects to PSU (myself included you damn bastards), but we can still be objective about the absurd amount of legitimate talent Franklin is stockpiling. It's gotta translate on the field though, and the jury is still out on that for at least another season until it's Franklin's guys out there every down."
CFB,3dru9w,CFSparta92,2,Sun Jul 19 01:38:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think that's a very fair assessment of Shaka and Franklin. You guys just get a bad rap because JayRU likes to come in and shit on recruits who happen to commit to PSU
CFB,3dru9w,Sh-tstirrer,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to see the kings of sour grapes with recruiting, look at some of the beat writing for Syracuse. If a player chooses another school over them, it's because the player didn't have a committable Syracuse offer or some bullshit, as if that was entirely the reason the player chose a different school.  I think the guys that commit to PSU do it because Franklin is a wizard recruiter selling kids on making an early impact at a big school with a lot of exposure, and positive recruiting momentum snowballs, just the same as negative recruiting does. When a kid weighing his options sees a class filling out with highly-ranked prospects, it's gonna make some of them want to hop onboard and be part of it. Some are turned off by that and don't want all the bells and whistles, but Franklin is seldom going to go wrong making 17 and 18-year-old kids feel like they're going to come in and set the world on fire."
CFB,3dru9w,scarletorthodontist,2,Sun Jul 19 02:06:30 2015 UTC,I discussed this with /u/scarletorthodontist but it's a shame you guys don't play on your history more. I think kids eat that up and playing in a school that touts tradition (like a lot of B1G teams) gets kids real excited.
CFB,3dru9w,Sh-tstirrer,3,Sun Jul 19 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult because there's a lot of school history to tout, and I'm sure Flood sells it as best he can, but football history isn't nearly as rich. One bowl prior to 2005, two undefeated seasons (beating teams like Colgate and Lafayette year-to-year), not scheduling power teams until the 1980s while woefully underinvesting in athletics, and not really putting any meaningful effort into football until the Schiano hire in 2000. Honestly, I think it's a stronger point to say it's a school with a rich history, now come and build the football team's future legacy.   I love the history of the football program. Guys like Paul Robeson, Frank Burns, and Alex Kroll are some phenomenal players to pass through the program early on, but it's pretty lean on success prior to the early 2000s. I think it's better to sell nine bowls in the last ten years, forging a new success in the Big Ten, and being part of establishing a winning tradition here and now. That's just how I look at it at least."

CFB,3dru9w,Bubblegum_Tate_21,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:45 2015 UTC,He was on the board but Rutgers is looking at Oliver and Ugonedu(spelling?) at DL.  Also think they want either Battle or Manning to fill out and play end.  Be honest I rarely hear his name come up but that may be due to him making it clear he wasn't coming to RU.

CFB,3dr1ds,Hobodownthestreet,6,Sat Jul 18 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not even sure if Florida State has a ""traditional"" game day food, and I've lived in this town for five years now.  There are the different restaurants around campus that are good before and after games: Momo's for giant pizzas, Gordo's for Cuban food (and most recently mold), Publix chicken... But there's nothing that really comes to mind in terms of actual tailgating food.  Sure, we grill just like everybody else, but when it comes down to it, Tallahassee is more of a drinking town than a food town.  We've got 32 bars within a mile and a half or two miles of the stadium, all of them realistically walking distance to the stadium:   Potbelly's - Typical college bar, shitty beer, wells, good atmosphere w/ live music.  Very Greek crowd, located one block from campus.  Very relaxed on fake IDs (as in they don't get paid enough to give a shit on game day with 5,000 people coming through the doors.) SideBar - Owned by the owner of Pot's, more of a small, nightclub environment on the inside, good outdoor deck, located on corner of Gaines and Railroad. The Standard - Nightclub, DJ's, generally douchey bartenders, very Greek, located downtown up the street from Pot's. Clyde's - Owned by the same folks as Standard, more of a general crowd, all indoor.  Good decor, a little more upscale looking. Mint - Wine and martini bar, upscale, owned by the same guy from Pot's and his friends.  Located next to 101 downtown. (21+, I think) 101 - Serves food/tapas, also an upscale bar.  Very expensive, located downtown. (21+, I think) Poor Paul's Pourhouse - On Tennesee St. near The Strip.  Laid back, great beer prices. (21+) Bullwinkle's Saloon - Right next to Poor Paul's, has great specials, laid back crowd. (21+) Bird's - More of a restaurant.  Best oysters in Tally, HUGE HUGE fucking burgers.  Good beer selection, live music. Ken's Tavern - The Strip, attracts all folks, big Greek crowd.  More of a nightclub since the reno of the Strip a few years back.  Red Rocks - The Strip, sister club to Ken's.  Same drink specials, harder crowd. Yianni's (home of the Y-Bomb) - The Strip, nightclub, big EDM/Greek crowd. Public House - The Strip, kind of a pub feel to it.  Has pool tables/darts, and a fuckload of beer. Encore/Encore Lounge - The Strip.  Nightclub.  Absolutely insane and expensive light and sound setup. Tin Cow (Previously AJ's) - On Tennessee St. past Stadium across from Chick-fil-a.  Typical bar, more of a restaurant now.  Don't think the party deck is open anymore. Coliseum - Sketchy South Beach-style nightclub next to CVS on Tenn. St., very Greek.  You go to Coliseum to do blow and watch DJs in town on tour.  Something like a $2.4 million dollar sound system. Zingales - Next to Coli, but unaffiliated.  Billiards room.  Haven't been there, so I don't know much about it. Proof on Tennesee St. - The place for beer in Tallahassee, more of a upperclassmen/young professional crowd.  (21+) Proof Brewery at Railroad Square - Where Proof brews the vast majority of their 9 or something house beers.  Much larger than the Tenn St location, has a nice outdoor area. (21+, I think) PrimeTime - Near Coliseum, has a weird sports bar feel to it.  Lots of TV's, overpriced and pretentious food, good drinks.  Brunch is worth it. Tabu (Previously 20/20, Lit, god knows what else) - A South Beach-style club off Pensacola Street  that just can't stay open for very long.  Sketchy as fuck. Baha's - A couple doors down from Tabu.  Pretty much the same as Tabu, but has managed to stay open based on insane drink specials and a reputation for being really chill on fake IDs. Scores (Used to be Cheeks before the shootout) - Don't go here. Palace - Haven't been there, but I think it's kind of a saloon type thing?  I have no clue.  I know they have sake.  Located right south of the stadium off Jackson Bluff. The Warehouse - Rundown warehouse on Gaines Street.  Live music, shit like that.  Hipsters galore. Fermentation Lounge - On St. Francis Road in the All Saints District.  Yet more hipsters, but also a pretty mixed crowd.  Very pretentious and expensive, but worth the bullshit for amazing drinks. Madison Social - In College Town just east of the stadium and adjacent to campus and the intramural fields.  Mediocre food, fantastic drinks, nice atmosphere and generally nice staff.  Might as well call this place Athens because it's Greek as fuck.  (21+ after 9, I think) Cantina - In College Town.  Shitty TexMex food and overpriced drinks.  They let people stand on the bars and shit.  Piss poor service. Recess - Upstairs from MadSo in College Town.  Has a pool, but when has that ever worked out well?  Apparently pretty cool place. MODA - Italian restaurant and bar.  Pretty popular.  Haven't been there, but it's relatively new. St. Michael's Pub - Pub on East Gaines Street.  Good drink specials, pool tables.  Cool place, very chill. The Brass Tap - On Gaines Street in Stadium Centre (I think?).  Great beer selection, has food.  Nice place, good crowd.  A lot like Proof. Chili's - On campus, at the Student Union.  Margaritas!   And if you want to count it (for girls at least) every fraternity house on campus or Heritage Grove.  And probably a few more that I don't even know about, plus the million more bars in Midtown, on Monroe, Appalachee, and god knows where else.  Sooo...yeah...this place has a lot of alcohol.  Edit: Added descriptions for out of towners and those generally unfamiliar with campus bars."

No mixes, no coke, no lighters, nothin. Stores can only be open Mon-Sat 10AM-9PM, and are closed on all major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Christmas Day, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day)  Any alcohol 3.2% or lower can be sold at grocery stores, gas stations, beer stands (although some can sell high point), etc. It can be refrigerated and can be sold any day of the week, but only until 2am. Can start selling again at 6am. Thus bars close at 2am.  So that's it. Long story short: if you get to Sunday or past 9pm and realize you want some wine or liquor, you're sol"

However, 3.2% ABW is 4% ABV, and a typical macro light lager is going to be around 4.2%.   So if OK's laws are like MN's, you're really not missing out on a ton of booze."

Also in a dictionary from like 17something it said ""barbecue=a hog dressed whole.""  You're not wrong for liking brisket, you're wrong for calling it barbecue. Barbecue is defined as pork.   edit: don't get me wrong, i love beef more than pork all day and if i owned a barbecue restaurant it would serve both pork and brisket. however, God made cows taste delicious naturally. most cuts of beef all you need is salt and pepper and that's it. pork shoulders don't have that built in awesomeness that beef does, you've got to create it yourself. that's one aspect where, in my opinion, the higher degree of difficulty comes into play. not to mention the sauce which is a whole nother argument."

CFB,3dr1ds,Coosy2,9,Sun Jul 19 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'll just repost something I put together for Michigan State fans last year. It includes lots of food options in Eugene. You can also watch a great video about local food, partially related to Oregon football, here.    First of all, early welcome to Eugene and the beautiful state of Oregon! Oregon fans are incredibly hospitable to opposing fans (except to Washington, USC, and some Beavers) and random guests alike - just ask Tennessee fans about their trip in 2013. You'll have a great time at the game and around town. There are tons of places to tailgate if you wish to do so. As you can see here, the green areas in the picture are the official tailgating areas on the school's property that surrounds the stadium. Just north of the stadium, and out of that picture, there are plenty of private lots for parking/tailgating.   However, I advise against doing your own tailgating. I would suggest meeting someone else at theirs. It's expensive, difficult to navigate, and requires really early arrival to tailgate at Autzen. My suggestion would be to park near campus, which is much easier and cheaper, grab breakfast or lunch in the area, pre-game at a bar just off campus, then walk through campus, across the bridge and through the woods, until you reach glorious Autzen. It's a great tradition we have, our little 1-mile journey to the stadium. When you reach the stadium, you'll notice some beautiful landscaping around the stadium, including a lovely waterfall, as well as stunning architecture of the surrounding buildings.  We also house the biggest indoor tailgater in the country. The Moshofsky Center, which houses our indoor practice field, turns into a massive tailgating area with food, drinks, and plenty of TVs.

Track Town Pizza -- http://www.tracktownoncampus.com -- 1809 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403 -- Big menu of pizzas, close to the stadium, and it's a huge Oregon sports restaurant with memorabilia and TVs everywhere.   McMenamins North Bank -- http://www.mcmenamins.com/353-north-bank-home -- 22 Club Road, Eugene, OR 97401 -- Nice restaurant on the Willamette River with good food and good craft beer. It's not on campus, but it's a great spot to eat.  Wild Duck Cafe -- http://www.wildduckcafe.net -- 1419 Villard Street, Eugene, OR 97403 -- Great modern, local sports bar across from Matthew Knight Arena.

Still the best Gyro I've ever had in the US (I grew up in SF and live in LA...I've been surrounded by great food my whole life).  Hawaiian Time -- https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hawaiian-Time/258122682765 -- 333 Coburg Road, Eugene, OR 97401 -- Fantastic traditional Hawaiian food with big portions and cheap prices.    Here are some great restaurants around Eugene for after the game:  Cornucopia -- http://cornucopiaeugene.com -- 295 W. 17th Ave, Eugene, OR 97401 -- Fantastic burger and brew combos. Lil Jack’s Hellion Burger is my go-to.  The Vintage -- http://www.eugenevintage.com -- 837 Lincoln St. Eugene, OR 97401 -- A cozy house-turned-restaurant with really good comfort food.  Izakaya Meiji -- http://izakayameiji.com -- 345 Van Buren, Eugene, Oregon 97402  -- It is a contemporary American twist on Japanese cuisine. East meets West. Asia meets hipster. Delicious blend of flavors.  Belly -- http://www.eatbelly.com -- 454 Willamette St., Eugene, OR 97401 -- Belly feels casual, but cozy. At night, it's a bit romantic. The food is the most flavorful in all of Eugene. The menu changes constantly, touching on flavors from all over the world.  Belly Taqueria -- http://www.eatbelly.com -- 30 E.

Hell, even Johnny had a redshirt. Kyle is going to start and be great. Kyler will have his moment. Can he be as incredible as Johnny? Sure. Too many people are drinking the kool-aid though.

CFB,3dqpvo,bruinwaterboy,2,Sat Jul 18 16:19:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the write-ups you do grizzfan, I enjoy reading them a lot. A quick question I was never able to glean from the internet/watching games---how exactly did Lane Kiffin change Alabama's offense in 2014 from Nussmeier in 2013 (besides adding hurry-up concepts to it)? What was it, more spread formations, motion, misdirection? I always keep hearing how Lane Kiffin opened up Bama's offense and I'm deathly curious, especially seeing how Albama seems to run many of the same formations and calls as 2012 USC, obviously to better effect."
CFB,3dqpvo,laynetrain,3,Sat Jul 18 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Nussmeier was more of a hard-nosed run-run-throw deep kind of guy.  With Nussmeier, you see a lot of multiple TE sets, maybe under center a little more.  The offense was a HEAVY zone running offense as well, and much of the passing game was off play action.  Think like how Stanford plays.  Same set of schemes, but instead of power being the base scheme, zone is the base scheme.    Kiffin is much more multiple/diverse in both formations and schemes.  His offense seems to vary week to week from run first, to pass first...he's pretty much looking to use his athletes and is more willing to flex his play calling based on his athletes; if he can throw, he'll throw, and if he can run, he'll run.  His style is much more similar to the style seen by OC's in the NFL, whereas Nussmeier seems to be much more of a system guy.      But most importantly...BUBBLE SCREENS!"
CFB,3dqpvo,TheCid,2,Sat Jul 18 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Great explanation! Maybe you can help with some of my issues:  My defense runs Saban's pattern match cov 3, but we can have trouble vs trips and formations where a down TE is opposite the two receiver side. My defense usually plays a game to trips and locks the C and ILB backside. We get caught a with rub routes and pick/wheel backside when we lock.  TE twins or trips away we try to carry the TE to the safety in the seam by the ILB or collision him to flats/shallow/hook/curl, but we end up setting our strength away from trips because we like to have our box set to the TE, which hurts us vs outside zone or option to the trips side. Thoughts?"
CFB,3dqpvo,laynetrain,3,Sun Jul 19 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but:   vs trips    I would reconsider running any form of cover 3 against trips. You have 3 deep coverage, but outside of 4 verts playcalls, trips doesn't usually attack the opposite deep third. If you're with a group of kids that's too young to run a lot of different coverages, I'd consider switching to the ""cover 6"" quarter/quarter/half alignment with the safeties. With two deep on the trips half of the field, you can have the extra DB on that side stay low unless he reads all 3 going upfield. Then you can scheme someone more aggressively underneath to fix your defense's handling of the rubs by having the guy who's reading low/high zoned into where the receiver is coming out of the rub. If you're with an older group or you already run other forms of defense, I'd consider switching to Cover 1 Robber in trips scenarios by default. You shouldn't do a literal man up (which will get you wrecked even harder by rubs than you already are) but an inside/middle/outside delay read where people just cover whoever's in that area. Might be too complicated a pattern match, in which case you might want to go full TCU-style and have zone on one half of the field and just man up whoever's on the opposite side. If you really want to shy away from man coverage at all, switch to cover 2 for this scenario and just have one less man deep in favor of one more body at the mid level. Shade the trips cornerback deeper than usual.   we end up setting our strength away from trips because we like to have our box set to the TE, which hurts us vs outside zone or option to the trips side   Have you tried not setting your box to the TE in trips? Sarcasm aside- I'd suggest fire zone, MLB blitz, trips side OLB blitz against trips with run down/distance potential. You could also sell out with a ""wide nine"" style front and have the linebackers ready to commit to stuffing the gut against the dive.  Fundamentally, trips is all about the offense selling out to one side and daring the defense to do the same. You either meet them head on, manning up on the backside and accepting that it's your line against theirs up the middle, or you make sure all your bases are covered and let the offense have an advantage on the trips side, saying ""you better make this work because there won't be anything else to fall back on""."
CFB,3dqpvo,laynetrain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"We absolutely get out of Cov. 3 vs. trips. When I said we run a ""game"", I meant we swap responsibilities between C, OLB, and FS. Sometimes 1/4's to that side and lock the backside. Our region has a lot of fast screen offenses, so we like to play games with our C and OLB to kill it.  Our personnel doesn't fit with a 2 safety scheme, which is something I probably should have put in the OP. We don't have two guys that can get off a hash, so Cov. 2 is just about out of the question for us."

CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,13,Sat Jul 18 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"1) We should be competing for ACC championships.  Historically we put together great teams, but we tend to hover in mediocrity, especially recently.    We have great facilities, despite contrary belief still great academics, a national brand, beautiful campus, NFL players, we just never had the right coaching.  Mack Brown showed how good we can be if we had the right combination but after he left, his successor Carl Torbush just couldn't do anything with his players.   John Bunting recruited NFL caliber players but again couldn't coach them.  Butch Davis had the most promise but Marvin Austin tweet brought down that house of cards.  The right coach can do a lot with this program.    2) I love him.  Our fans are pretty apathetic especially recently with football.  He has this high energy, in your face attitude, which is exactly what we need.  Not to mention he runs a uptempo, spread offense, that mirrors our basketball program style of play and is exciting to watch, especially after the John Shoop days.    3) 7-8 wins.  That has been our ceiling since 1997 and I can see that for this year.  2 FCS teams, easy OOC with Illinois, and UVA and Wake on the conference schedule.  Pitt, NC State, Miami and Duke are toss ups and we have guarantee losses at Georiga Tech and at Virginia Tech.    4) No.  We are in the ACC and we are on Tobacco Road.  Basketball success means everything in that area, don't let NC State fans fool into think they are a football only school.  Basketball is still king and will always be king in RTP."

UNC has a huge brand, NC has many good recruits, and we're beginning to make the staff investment necessary to preform at that level. I think Fedora gets a bad rap among fans. He's not the best in game coach, but he is a fantastic ""ceo"" of the program when it comes to energy, fan experience, and building up a program. I was willing to give him a huge leash since we were under ncaa sanctions for his first 3 seasons, but this was the first year we are not and we only signed 19 for 79 kids on scholarship, which is eyebrow raising, especially considering the lack of depth on the DL and LB core.  8-5, our schedule is actually really well set up for us, but we'll mess it up and come just short of the division title.

CFB,3dqoii,GryphonNumber7,4,Sun Jul 19 00:36:59 2015 UTC,UNC: How has the academic/athletic scandal affected the students/alumni's view of the university? Do you think the university has done the right thing since the story became public?
CFB,3dqoii,dchalk,12,Sat Jul 18 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"As a current student, I love my school and wouldn't trade my time here for anything. The administration did screw up, both in not having proper oversight and by not reacting fast enough when everything came out. Everyone who was implicated has been removed, and i am generally happy with the new administration and coach Fedora.   However, one thing that does annoy me is trying to explain to morons that the university as a whole is still a magnificent institution, and that maleficence in one department should not make my degree or anyone else's degree somehow 'weaker' than before.   This is what annoyed me most about the circlejerk regarding the scandal in some of the threads here, with many people at times calling for accreditation to be revoked for the entire institution. Luckily, outside of the sports world and outside of North Carolina, most people I have talked to either don't know about it or go 'oh, athletes cheated, why is this a surprise?'."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,6,Sat Jul 18 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think during the initial stages of the scandal the school did everything wrong.  They never took the offensive and tried to control the narrative but rather just wished the story went away.  Since we hire Folt and Bubba I felt like we took the better approach.  I like the fact we produced the Wainstein report and we went into that much depth to investigate ourselves.  Part of the ""Carolina Way"" should be doing the right thing, regardless of how much it will hurt you.    But as an alumni I am kind of pissed the school allowed all this to occur for so long.  Athletics aside, this was an academic department that was run with no oversight by the school.  When I was student we knew AFAM was a joke department but I didn't realize how bad it was.  A part me also feels the university did not care about that department because they felt they had to have an African Americans studies program just to remain diverse over it's actual academic benefits.  And so long as they had one on paper, it was all hunky dory."

When UNC has the bell (which, let’s be real, it usually does), it leads the team out onto the field before kickoff. Also, the bell’s cart is spraypainted in the winning team’s blue, so for each game, the team that doesn’t have the bell brings spray paint to the game and will spray it immediately after (if they win).   We got the bell back this year after two long years, and hopefully it'll stay in its rightful home for another twenty years."

From 1973 to 1984 we had at least one player rush for over 1,000 yards each season.  It wasn't until the 1990's that we didn't consistently have a player run over 1,000 yards."
CFB,3dqoii,jayhawx19,4,Sat Jul 18 16:02:40 2015 UTC,Who is the player to watch on your team this season?
CFB,3dqoii,certificateofmerritt,6,Sat Jul 18 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"Marquise William, Senior QB. When he’s bad, it’s ugly. But when he’s good, he’s on fire. Last season, he threw for 3,000 yards and ran for almost 1,000.  You may remember him from the Notre Dame game last season, where he had a touchdown trifecta (ran, threw, and caught a touchdown). He set records last season as our QB and looks to break his own records again this season. He headlines a very talented offense, with a lot of experience."
CFB,3dqoii,TheRealRafiki,6,Sat Jul 18 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"I want to add Ryan Switzer to the list. He tied the single season punt return record his freshman year. Although he faltered last season (as did our special teams top to bottom), I expect that he will have a resurgence in his punt return abilities and bring a few back. He still has 2 years to get to 8 returns to set the NCAA career record.  He's also a decent receiver who we seem to like to throw the deep ball to. If MW can get a little more accurate on those deep balls, I expect to see them connect for some long plays."
CFB,3dqoii,Gryfer,5,Sat Jul 18 18:58:48 2015 UTC,Switzer is fun as hell to watch.
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:41 2015 UTC,He should be our wes welker.   If we marquise is accurate this season i see big things from him.
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,5,Sat Jul 18 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"Quarterback Marquise Williams – His ability to play well is make or break for our offense.  While our offense was explosive last season, it was very inconsistent, and you can chart that inconsistency with Marquise’s play.  He is a rhythm qb and it didn’t help when we started the season with a two qb rotation that wrecked his rhythm.  When we got out of that, he played much better until his injury.  Still he put up 3,000 yards passing and almost 800 yard rushing  (best on the team) with a total of 34 total touchdowns, best  in school history.   In order to have a stellar senior year, he needs to work on his touch on deep passes and his consistency.   Still if he played like he did last season, statistically he will probably go down as the best qb in UNC history."
CFB,3dqoii,Conglossian,3,Sat Jul 18 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Since we covered Switzer and Williams above I'll go with Brian Walker. He started out last year really well before what appears to be a falling out with the defensive staff and he really lacked effort the last few weeks. If he shows up, he will lock down his man in pass coverage, but that is the if situation."

CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,7,Sat Jul 18 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"1) At first, it sucked, because you don't lose to Duke because they were that bad.  But now, I see it as an overall positive.  Makes the rivalry that much more exciting and another reason why our team needs to be better.    2) Miami.  We have them at home.  They are a great team but I'm hoping playing them at home will give us the edge."

CFB,3dqoii,jts1194,4,Sun Jul 19 13:24:10 2015 UTC,1) How much playing time will Mitch Trubisky see this season? I know Marquise is definitely the guy but it seemed that Trubiksy had a fair amount of hype/snaps last season. 2) Which freshman do you expect to contribute most to your team this season? 3) Looking forward to playing y'all next year; grew up rooting for Carolina basketball.
CFB,3dqoii,dchalk,6,Sat Jul 18 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"1) TBH, hopefully only when we are winning by 21+ or if Marquise needs a breather. Our offense had some serious problems when we tried a 2-QB system, and Marquise really got going once he was 'The guy'. Not to say that Mitch doesn't have a lot of promise; his game winning throw when Marquise went down with an injury during the UVA game was a perfect example of a backup stepping up when needed.  2) Jalen Dalton. Apparently William Sweet is pushing for playing time on the OL, but we don't have much depth on the DL, and Jalen Dalton fills a huge need there. I expect him to get more playing time throughout the year.   3) I wish y'all came to Chapel Hill next year, but it will be nice playing you guys as well.

TU's new HC this year is Philip Montgomery, Baylor's old OC. Should be a rebuilding year, but I expect exciting football anyway.

It’s got a great brunch, good beer, and the view over Franklin Street is worth sitting on the patio even in the winter. You’ll find lots of UNC fans at Topo before, during, and after games.   If you’re looking for a bar, look no further than He’s Not Here. This famous dive is the home of the Blue Cup, which is the best deal on beer in town, and you can keep the cup. But if you’re not a beer drinker, you may have a tough time finding something to drink, since they don’t have a liquor license.   After gameday, I like to go to the Carolina Inn, and hang out on their front porch. The beer is reasonably priced, and they have the nicest bathrooms in Chapel Hill. The crowd is usually a little older and bougie, but if you’re looking for somewhere to go post-game before dinner, this is my favorite place to go."

A drug store/soda fountain , the oldest shop on Franklin St.  The walls of the store have pictures of celebrities who have eaten there.    After a game, Top of the Hill for a drink and watch the crowds go by underneath.    IP3 is also a fun place to watch football , eat pizza, and drink beer with some sassy Italian guys.

CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,7,Sat Jul 18 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"South Carolina.  First game of the season, against a SEC opponent, at a neutral site, talk about pressure.  Our defense last season was the worst in school history and we hired Gene Chizk to make sure that never happens again.  But of course we first get to test against an SEC team that is familiar with his style of coaching.  Throw into the mix that we have no studs on defense and now you have the entire Tar Heel nation holding their breath until we see that first tackle by a UNC player.  Until that game and our defensive showing, we will not know how our season will go.  A good defense, we are a division contender, same defense as last year and we will struggle for a bowl game like last season.   While we are not too concerned about our offensive ability, last season our offense in major gaps, chose not to show up for games.   That lack of consistency hurt the team when we had to win games via a shootout.  Hopefully with a better defense (hell I will take an average defense at this point) there is less pressure on the offense to score and as a result they will play looser more efficient.    Two other teams to put on the list is @Virginia Tech and @Georgia Tech.  Historically one of these two teams wins the Coastal.  Blacksburg is a scary place to play and Georgia Tech is a scary team to play.  I don’t see us beating both but if we want to win the division we have to at least beat one."

CFB,3dqoii,certificateofmerritt,4,Sat Jul 18 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"team?  We’re a pretty solid bowl team, I’d say we’re a contender for the Belk Bowl!   I’m going to drink the light blue Kool-aid for a minute and talk about why this team is a conference championship team. Feel free to judge, I’m judging myself right now.    We bring back a killer offense. Not only do we bring back Marquise (with his hip fixed), we also bring back all of our running backs, our top 4 wide receivers, and 5 starters on the line, including Senior Guard Landon Turner who is a first-team preseason All-America by Phil Steele. We were a top 25 offense last year, and we can do even better this year now that we have more experience.  Our Defense can’t be as bad as it was last year. Ranked 99th in Def S&P+ last season, we stunk. Last season we won games by outscoring the other team, not by stopping them from scoring (see GT). Coach Fedora hired Gene Chizik out of retirement to be our new DC and they look to take a defense that really lost its way last season out of the dark and into the light. If we can make some gains in defense, maybe even going up as high as mediocre, we could be a contender in the Coastal."
CFB,3dqoii,Twistify804,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"Hell, if our offense performs like it should than mediocre could give us a solid shot at an ACC Championship appearance."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,2,Sun Jul 19 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"Our ceiling since 1997 has been 8 wins.  I can see 8 wins this season if we are lucky and live up to my expectations of this season.  Brian Walker, a defensive back, has higher goals of 10+, but it’s one of those I’ll believe it when I see it.  But to win the Coastal, pretty much the first team to win 5 games get to play in the ACC championship game, and if we can do that, that will be a major victory for this season.    But 7-8 win season is my prediction, a so-so bowl game, and hopefully more momentum for future seasons."
CFB,3dqoii,rloutlaw,3,Sat Jul 18 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"UNC-You had some killer teams in the mid to late 1990s, for a couple of years there you were the only team in the conference that people in Tallahassee gave pause to. What happened?  Also, as a Triangle resident but working in the tech world for years now, the general apathy for college football in a densely populated region with three P5 schools is just baffling. Why is that? Is it really just basketball?"
CFB,3dqoii,ClaudeLemieux,8,Sat Jul 18 20:08:51 2015 UTC,Turns out Mack Brown is actually a good coach.  And yeah for the most part it's basketball.  NC State is the only one of the three with students equally rabid for both.
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:20:23 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel if NC State had a championship in basketball in the 90s or 2000s, your fan base would be just as apathetic in football too.    Outside of that 2002 season, there is nothing really outstanding in terms of football success."
CFB,3dqoii,ClaudeLemieux,4,Sat Jul 18 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Really? In 2006, we had statistically a top 5 defense in the country.  We produced a #1 overall pick in Mario Williams, allowing us to be one of now 10 schools with #1 overall in the NBA and the NFL drafts.  That d-line had 3 first round picks and a fourth.  Russell Wilson's 3 years here were spectacular.  First QB in ACC history to make first team all conference as a freshman, and he broke the NCAA record for most consecutive passes without an interception (fuck you Wake).  And similarly, a few years ago Amerson finished (at the time) 2nd in NCAA history in interceptions in a season.  We've won 8+ games a few times the last few years.  Is that enough success to pretend that we're actually good? No. Only that 2002 season were we nationally relevant in recent memory.  But it's still definitely enough to say we've been successful."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,6,Sat Jul 18 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"But that 2006 team was 3-9, bottom of the Atlantic and lost to an equally bad UNC team.   Mario Williams was a stud, and State has put some quality players like Rivers.  But I can compare draft picks with UNC 8 first rounders off the defensive line in the past 20 years, yet we are not considered a caliber football program, especially in the last 20 years.    You have won 8 games a few times in the last few years, excluding the vacated wins, so has UNC.  You and I can both agree, no coach aims for an 8-4 season year after year.      But UNC and State, have had similar seasons over the course of the last 10 years, the difference is year after year State maintains that fan support while UNC struggles at times.  I love the passion NC State fans bring to the program, but I always wondered if NC State kept pace in basketball with Duke and UNC, would that fan support still be around in football if the football records stayed the same.  They have had good seasons, but never dominated the triangle, let alone the conference or nationally.  Of the sports programs at State, football has been the best until Gotfried arrived.  So I ask, not out of slight, but do you think that fan support for football would exist if State had remain a powerhouse in basketball?"
CFB,3dqoii,ClaudeLemieux,3,Sat Jul 18 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"Actually I got my year wrong - it was 2005 we had that defense (I think we went 5-7, so it's not like your point still isn't valid.  Just for accuracy's sake).  I honestly think we would.  For all the jokes about ""cow college"" and ""Moo U"" and all that shit, there is a layer of truth to it.  Culturally, we do have that more ""Southern"" vibe than UNC (and especially moreso than Duke).  And I think that would still be reflected by a raucous crowd at C-F on Fall Saturdays than at Kenan, Wallace Wade or BB&T."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,2,Sat Jul 18 22:33:03 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  I am jealous of the fan support both teams state gets.  Im just hoping for us they just focus on bball because its that successful.
CFB,3dqoii,ClaudeLemieux,2,Sun Jul 19 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry.  The last time yall were in Raleigh, your football team danced on our logo.  And you know what they say...The North Carolina State Never Forgets"
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:45 2015 UTC,"1) The simple answer - Mack Brown left.    The long answer is that after Mack Brown left, the school did not make an effort to find a replacement to attempt to match that level of success.  Carl Torbush, Mack's successor was also his assistant coach.  After Torbush, John Bunting, a Carolina guy who had no business coaching a P5 team with his resume followed and we kept him around 2 seasons too long.  Butch Davis was making progress but all of that fell apart when the scandal began to unfold.    2) The triangle is home to the best college basketball in the country.  All three football programs have been average for most of their programs history.  You get excited about winning programs, not so-so programs, hence why basketball is king, and football is the pauper."
CFB,3dqoii,rloutlaw,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the history-I knew about Brown at UNC but I figured the University would have found staff to keep the momentum he had going. If there is one thing that UNC has it is resources to do whatever they want. Still, finding a good coach is always a challenge even if you have a blank check.  2) Sort of explains what I see every year-some enthusiasm at the start that falls off as the season goes on and basketball gets closer. The NCSU fans tend to pay attention a bit longer. It's a huge constrast to the ECU and App State alumni I run into that more or less treat the start of football season like a six year old handles Christmas."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"1) While finding a good coach is a challenge, we never really tried to find a good coach until Butch and I think that is when we saw money really start to pour into cfb and we were being left behind.  Our AD didn't want to spend the money and thought basketball is all we needed in terms of athletic success.    2) State fans pay attention longer because for a while basketball season was more of a disappointment.  For most of our casual fans, football is what you watch until basketball season starts.  But if we start winning games then you can expect crowds in Kenan to start to grow again."
CFB,3dqoii,dchalk,2,Sat Jul 18 20:42:39 2015 UTC,1) We did almost get Frank Beamer.
CFB,3dqoii,jayhawx19,2,Sun Jul 19 02:52:49 2015 UTC,Who is a player that has the most potential to have a breakout year?
CFB,3dqoii,certificateofmerritt,4,Sat Jul 18 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"Elijah Hood, Sophomore Tailback. He got some play time last season, but struggled with an injury. He was highly recruited and looked good when he played last season."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,2,Sat Jul 18 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"To add - Last season, when played he had flashes of what his recruiting hype was all about.  However he was hampered by injury and only played in 9 games.  Before his injury he was really starting to roll, scoring a touchdown in three straight games.  There is a lot of hype that now that he understands the offense and the pace of play at this level and he is 100% that he will be bulldozing through defenses.  His numbers may not be up there since he is splitting carries with TJ Logan (a speedy back) and Marquise Williams in our spread option offense.    But expect to see him, a power back, in short yardage and goal line situations."
CFB,3dqoii,jayhawx19,2,Sat Jul 18 16:39:31 2015 UTC,Which opponent scares you the least? Why?
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,3,Sat Jul 18 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Toss up between NC A&T and Delaware.  We got stuck with two FCS teams this season, not sure why.  First time in forever this has been the case, but hopefully this isn’t a trend (looking at you NC State)"
CFB,3dqoii,jayhawx19,2,Sat Jul 18 16:05:19 2015 UTC,Which game defines your teams season?
CFB,3dqoii,dchalk,4,Sat Jul 18 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say Virginia Tech. It will be a tough out at Lane Stadium towards the end of the season, but I am hoping we will be in the hunt for 8-9 wins. A win against them to get us towards that goal would be a statement win for us and give us some positive momentum for when we play NC State the next week."
CFB,3dqoii,certificateofmerritt,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"While I would like to say that it would be the Duke game, especially since they've gotten better the last few years, but in all honestly, it still probably is the game against NC State that is the most defining."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,3,Sat Jul 18 15:27:03 2015 UTC,"NC State and Duke.  Way too much in-state bragging rights that go on.    In the past you wanted to beat Duke because it would embarassing to lose to an 0-24 team.  Now they are good and a obstacle if we want to win the Coastal.  Plus we play for the Victory Bell and that bell should be only painted one shade of blue, Carolina Blue.    Beating NC State, for me at least, has been more of we can't let them win or else we will never hear the end of it.  But with all the scandal stuff and Pack Pride spearheading the charge, I want to beat State to remind them who big brother really is."
CFB,3dqoii,Twistify804,3,Sat Jul 18 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"Regarding NC State, that last paragraph has never been truer. If you beat NC State 29 times out of 30, all you're going to hear about is the 1 time they won."

CFB,3dqoii,Colvjs,2,Sat Jul 18 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"UNC: Honestly not trying to be incendiary, but how worried are you about fallout from the current NCAA allegations? Do you think the football team will be heavily affected?"
CFB,3dqoii,bandit16,7,Sat Jul 18 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not that worried about much fallout linked to the football team. They were hardly mentioned in the NOA and Fedora seems fairly confident nothing will happen to the program. Even if we are punished, I don't see it being that severe, considering what we got a couple years ago."
CFB,3dqoii,dchalk,5,Sat Jul 18 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"Building off of that, no one on the current team or the staff had anything to do with the crap that went on. I wouldn't put it past the NCAA, but it would be messed up to hit the university twice and affect only innocents the second time."
CFB,3dqoii,Conglossian,2,Sat Jul 18 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"The only way they should be hit is in a univeristy wide LOIC punishment, but the COI should never be predicted. But reading through the NOA, there is nothing specific for football to really worry about themselves."
CFB,3dqoii,TheRealRafiki,2,Sat Jul 18 23:50:44 2015 UTC,I expect there to be widespread institutional punishments that don't particularly affect the football team.  Women's bball is likely to have a severe punishment as they were the most egregious offenders. I wouldn't be surprised with postseason ban/scholarships from women's bball and a postseason ban for men's bball as well as significant financial penalties and institution-wide probation for 2+ years.
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"We have been dealing with this cloud over the program for the past 5 years.  Right now we just want a resolution to move on.  Other coaches have gave recruits copies of the Wainstein report as part of their pitch, and telling them the hammer will come down.  Personally, I think the rumors that formed while we wait will do more harm than the actual sanctions will be."
CFB,3dqoii,FSBlueApocalypse,2,Sat Jul 18 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a dick, just looking for an honest answer.  UNC is constantly listed as one of the most under achieving programs in football. UNC is the #1 school in a recruiting hotbed and with ungodly amounts of money at their disposal. So why has football been so medicore the last 30+ years besides Mack Brown (& had Twittergate not happened I thought Butch Davis was building something)?"
CFB,3dqoii,Conglossian,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Go back and look at 2010 UNC's roster, that team could've won the national title. Not joking. NFL scouts remarked the same at the combine. It's been a mixture of leadership ineptitude and poor decisions, hopefully that's ending soon."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,3,Sat Jul 18 23:52:22 2015 UTC,Fucking Dick Baddour.
CFB,3dqoii,FSBlueApocalypse,2,Sat Jul 18 23:54:08 2015 UTC,Oh I agree UNC's team at the time could've won a BCS title had one of their player not flashed all of their agent's money on Twitter.
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"I answered this elsewhere but in my opinion we never had consistent coaching in our school history.  After Mack left, the school didn't make an effort to find a qualified successor.  We stuck with the interim Carl Torbush for Mack's successor and he did a whole lot of nothing with Mack's recruits.  After Torbush, Bunting did a whole lot less, but we went with him because he was a ""Carolina Guy"" but didn't have the resume to coach a P5 school.  Part of the feeling in Carolina is that before Butch, the school didn't care that much about football.  We never tried to be great, but just good enough, hence why we never attempted to look for a big name hire, or at least spend the money for a quality coach."
CFB,3dqoii,Dr_Blue_Cesped,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:51:45 2015 UTC,Tell me which game in school history was the worst loss ever. Which game caused you to be angry for years? What made this game so emotional? Did you ever get revenge?
CFB,3dqoii,travisun,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"for me at least, the 70-41 loss to ECU. It was embarrassing, we lost for the second time in a row. Nope."

CFB,3dqoii,stm91,11,Sat Jul 18 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"One time in undergrad I sat behind former FB Anthony Elzy at UNC's Late Night With Roy (men's basketball kick off).  He was texting his friends that he was ""tired of all this fucking basketball shit."""
CFB,3dqoii,need4snead,3,Sat Jul 18 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a law student at TU, and tuition runs roughly $36,000/year. I assume that's well above the state schools in Oklahoma. For a private school, it's actually not too bad."
CFB,3dqoii,mellolizard,3,Sat Jul 18 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  We got some big time football recruits (Julius Peppers) because they wanted to play both.  And with basketball there is a national brand of UNC that exists around the country.    But at the same time, we are a basketball school and the media attention will focus there first unless our football team can prove otherwise.  In the past our athletic department has made decisions that doubled down on basketball and hurt our football program.   In the end though, if our football team wants more support, they will have to give the fans a reason to, ie winning games."

I feel like this situation will ultimately resolve itself with the way the landscape is changing and SOS becoming more important. The NY6 bowls made geographical sense this past year. The NCG even ended up working out as B1G vs Pac-12. I don't understand the clamoring for certain conference vs certain conference--I'd rather just have good match ups in general."

I approach it from the historical perspective--- there is certainly value in the traditional Big Ten vs. Pac-12 matchup, and given the long (and high-profile) history of the Rose Bowl it makes sense to keep promoting it in some way, shape, or form.  On a basic level that tradition is what creates rivalries, an essential part of college football."

I'd argue that the Rose Bowl wasn't important to the Big Ten and Pac-8/10/12 because they were facing each other, but because it was their de facto national championship game. It was the highest point that teams from those conferences could ascend to between 1947 and 1997. About half of those games involved at least one team within striking distance of winning a national championship. It was an important game out of necessity, not some inherent rivalry."
CFB,3dqxvj,DafoeFoSho,6,Sat Jul 18 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"I think the 2014 game between Michigan State and Stanford is a perfect example of a classic Rose Bowl matchup. You could tell how much the game itself meant to the players and fans from both schools despite no championships being on the line. Michigan State in particular really left it all out there because the Rose Bowl victory itself was a great accomplishment for them.  Beyond that, there are other things like the Beef Bowl and the marching bands of both schools playing in the Rose Parade--- these are great traditions that make the Rose Bowl an important (even to the casual viewer) game."
CFB,3dqxvj,Everyone_Else_Sucks,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I think if you were to rank the reasons why people like the Rose Bowl game, you'd have:   location venue festivities (parade, New Year's Day) traditional matchup   There's no inherent rivalry with the Pac-12 that raises the importance of the game, other than maybe Ohio State/Michigan vs. USC/UCLA, but only because those teams faced off in the Rose Bowl so often.  I'm with you--I'd rather see good matchups of any kind than a specific conference-vs.-conference showdown."

Currently, it seems like P5 teams only want to schedule as many P5 matchups as they have to in order to boost their record.   I'd love to see a Chicago bowl game. As far as weather is concerned, they play the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. Having a winter game in Chicago isn't that much of stretch comparatively.

CFB,3dqckm,blackoutfish,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"I believe its more about the schedule inequity. The polls work themselves out to a degree but the SEC schedule model works in their favor throughout the season with the extra OOC game. The big XII plays 9 conference games, while the SEC only plays 8. Most college football fans don't understand the math in that and how it affects the polls later in the season. In addition, they stay healthier and can create pseudo bye weeks in their schedule. With one less conference game and a +1 OOC powder puff scheduled, the Big 12 and Pac12 for example have to split a win/loss across the conference, while the SEC gets a +1 win across the entire conference. A 7-3 SEC team turns into a 8-3 SEC team, while a 7-3 Big 12 team can turn into a 7-4 team. I don't really blame the SEC for sticking to their schedule model since it works out so well for them because the average fan has no idea the effect of that schedule inequity has on the polls. The B1G goes to 9 conference games next season so that leaves the SEC and ACC with the only 8 game conference schedules."

I don't know if anything ever came of it but there was talk of FSU suing WVU for damages for economic impact, because WVU is a bigger game than Savannah State"
CFB,3dqckm,blackoutfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:10 2015 UTC,What's funny is FSU was probably already looking into canceling the 2nd half of the series (the @ WVU) but since WVU cancelled first... time to get out the lawyers and make some money.

Usually see a game or two a year where a team backs out for whatever reason. It really just depends on the schools involved and the economics. A school like Baylor would be best off finding another school with a weak OOC schedule (read- no P5 opponents) and both take the hit and split the buyout."
CFB,3dqx65,non-rhetorical,10,Sat Jul 18 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"No. Other than in goal-to-go situations and without a penalty being enforced, a new series is always 1st and 10.   And a related situation: Like you said, a false start after te first down would make it 1st and 15, but what about the following play? 3rd and 6. Offense gains 7 yards. After the play an offensive player is flagged for unnecessary roughness for a late block. What's the down and distance?"

CFB,3dqx65,LegacyZebra,5,Sat Jul 18 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Since the foul was a dead ball foul, the third down play counts before enforcing the penalty. The offense successfully reached the line to gain, so they will get a first down. And since the new line to gain isn't established until the ready for play signal, it is still 1st and 10 after enforcement. A lot of people think this should be 1st and 25, but it's not."

CFB,3dqx65,bobby8375,3,Sat Jul 18 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"It depends.  If the ready for play signal has been given and a dead ball foul occurs (ie false start, unsportsmanlike), then the line to gain stays where it is.

CFB,3doe2q,tb3648,2,Sat Jul 18 05:06:33 2015 UTC,"Plus, these college coaches take pride in being so much more than just a coach. That's why so many of them want to coach college in the first place. They want to be able to help grow these boys into men both on and off the field. They want to be mentors to these kids who had a rough upbringing, or didn't have a father figure in their life, or whatever the case may be. That was basically Bobby Bowden's MO."

CFB,3doe2q,djsquilz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"The dimensions and deepness with which modern recruiting has gone to find out everything they can about players is incredible (I don't approve of it, but it is).  Are you telling me that coaches cannot find out information about these players and whether they have behavior issues or not?  Contact their teachers, principals and coaches.  If there have been complaints and issues previously and do not seem to be turning over new leaf, they do not deserve the honor they are being given. See above.  However, if what you say is true, and these behavioral tendencies are created while they are on campus, they should be able to see them develop during practices and take disciplinary action appropriately.  The most likely place they are getting the behavior from is from upperclassmen on your team because they see them as leaders and they spend most of their waking time with them at practice.  If it's from outside the program, nip it in the butt, post haste.   It is an honor to represent your school, so much so that the school is paying for you to do so.  If you do not reflect and demonstrate the finest qualities of your university you should not be representing it in an official capacity, which is exactly what being a student-athlete is.  Such offers should not be made lightly.  As I said above, if the student has shown strides and progress in turning over a new leaf from previous troubles, fine, offer, and help them grow.  They are showing potential.  If they do not, they do not deserve to represent the University, and deserve to enter it upon their own merit.  If they do so, that is good for them, they are getting an education and are paying for it.  It does not matter whether the coach wants them on the team or not at that point.  But teams are reflections of their student bodies as much as they are reflections of their coaching staff's connections."
CFB,3doe2q,ARayofLight,12,Sat Jul 18 02:42:43 2015 UTC,"Contact their teachers, principals and coaches. If there have been complaints and issues previously and do not seem to be turning over new leaf, they do not deserve the honor they are being given.   Without trying to sound combative, this doesn't really answer my question. What counts as an attitude problem? Obviously things like gang connections and criminal history are immediate markers. But that doesn't fit a lot of recruits. Many times the biggest red flags are nothing unusual for regular high school students and really aren't things that would justify yanking a scholarship.   Example: I used to go to school with NFL first rounder Nelson Agholor (I've talked about it before). Early in his high school time, he had some issues there like not following dress code, cussing at students, etc. But throughout his time he learned to calm down and became a likable guy. So what would you have done? What constitutes ""turning over a new leaf""? By a lot of accounts, Dalvin Cook had turned over a new leaf!   they should be able to see them develop during practices and take disciplinary action appropriately   How were coaches supposed to see that De'Andre Johnson would punch someone at a bar? Anger management issues? He had none.   But teams are reflections of their student bodies as much as they are reflections of their coaching staff's connections.   Of course, but surely you would agree that they are still college kids and are not pinnacles of maturity. You've already said that you think the class is useless--well what do you want done? FSU seems to be taking steps to try and make sure that more of their players do get the message they need to about being public figures. It almost seems like you're setting them up for failure. ""We want to help you mature, but we don't want to be proactive in it""?"
CFB,3doe2q,crazythrowa,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:59:19 2015 UTC,"I think that in the case of FSU, and other programs that have this issue, it is fully institutional and it can only be fixed by better recruiting and new faces.  I don't think there is a way to properly fix it necessarily for those currently in the program.  I say this as someone who has seen mandatory classes or mandatory education seminars become campus jokes (in this case, on the topic of drinking safely).  Mandatory classes help some, but not all.  It starts from having good leadership from upperclassmen who set the proper example.    If the president of FSU truly thinks that the quality and people who are a part of the FSU football team cannot set themselves up as proper respectable examples for underclassmen to model their behavior after, there is an institutionalized culture that needs to be changed, and one class is not going to do it.  It takes new people.  Sometimes, that means a new coach too (though not necessarily).  There was a lot of acting out and rowdy behavior from players as Tedford left and Dykes showed up.  It took 2 years for all the disgruntled and misbehaving to transfer, graduate, or declare.  Those who stayed understood the proper way to behave and represent themselves."
CFB,3doe2q,ARayofLight,7,Sat Jul 18 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a way to properly fix it necessarily for those currently in the program   If there is a course of action that can possibly help, there is absolutely no reason to not take it. I understand that you don't think it will help. But if there is even the chance that at least 1 guy benefits from this class, then I see no reason why it shouldn't be enacted. There is no point of wallowing in a ""woe is me"" attitude when there are solutions that can be easily instituted.   If the president of FSU truly thinks that the quality and people who are a part of the FSU football team cannot set themselves up as proper respectable examples for underclassmen to model their behavior after, there is an institutionalized culture that needs to be changed, and one class is not going to do it.   One class isn't all of what they're doing. Look at the article.   When you recruit from the areas that Florida teams do, you are bound to get a few bad apples. You have to take risks with some guys and sometimes those risks don't pay off. Do you know a guy by the name of Darnell Dockett? He had one of the roughest upbringings I can remember. His mother was killed when he was a kid, his father died months later, his name was in police records by the time he was 13. He has admitted that he sometimes had to steal food for dinner. Football was the only thing he had going in his life. By your criteria, Dockett would have been left to die in the same neighborhoods that he grew up in. But FSU took a chance on him. He didn't always live up to the responsibilities put upon him--but he is now the father of a child he can support and was able to find success in football.  The view that colleges can somehow predict the future with recruits and avoid all problems is garbage. This idea that any part of a college can be completely void of troublemakers is ridiculous and it lends itself to an irrational approach to topics of punishment and expectations. What's wrong with making mistakes (that can be fixed)? What is wrong with taking a chance on a guy who has nothing else?"
CFB,3doe2q,crazythrowa,-7,Sat Jul 18 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Scholarships are not designed to be Golden Tickets for people to escape poor situations.  They can be, and they are fantastic when they do, but do not make the argument that athletic scholarships have to be that way.  If he truly comes from such a situation, would he have made it into FSU directly? Aren't there other need-based scholarships available to students from such a situation?  Would Dockett not have gotten out that way, if motivated to do so?  I disagree with your argument about it being part in parcel to sports in Florida.  Don't go after the hot shot 4 and 5 stars and take the humble 2 and 3 stars.  It's better for the school and its better for the kids who are being chosen.  College football is not the solution to the problems you are talking about.  Education, proper primary, secondary, and higher education are the solutions.  It's why you should vote to help fund those institutions (by bond, donation, and tax) so they can take more people and teach them properly in safe environments that give them tools to get help.  If someone is truly violent, psychological counseling (group, one on one, and peer) is a better alternative to a class.  It would cost more though, and would acknowledge that violent actions are related to mental development."
CFB,3doe2q,ARayofLight,7,Sat Jul 18 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"Would Dockett not have gotten out that way, if motivated to do so?   Well yes, if his life had turned out completely differently then sure he would have had other ways. But that deflects from the reality of his journey: He did have a way out of his situation. His athletic ability. Why not use that to benefit himself?   Don't go after the hot shot 4 and 5 stars and take the humble 2 and 3 stars.    That's operating under the assumption that lower ranked/not as talented players are less likely to get in trouble during their college time. An overview of many schools below D-I level (and at less prestigious D-1 institutions) proves this incorrect.    College football is not the solution to the problems you are talking about   Do you mean it's not the primary solution? Because it certainly is the solution for many recruits. I'd agree that it shouldn't be the first one to come to mind...but we're operating in a country where education gets the backseat in many budgets. Denying the current reality is negligent at best and harmful at worst. I can vote for better funding for schools and still totally believe that sports can operate as a way out. There's nothing contradictory to that."

The coach and the AD were fired and consequently, it's not happening any more.  If we can change, so can FSU.  Also, I do not have an issue with taking people from such neighborhoods.  Did not say that once, do not read farther than I have typed.  I said clearly that its about an individual's behavior, not the behavior of the place they come from.  But, people who have behavioral issues do not deserve the opportunity to represent their universities in a public forum.  Also, as I may have not made this clear- people deserve second chances.  In the case of the two students who got suspended, I would have suspended them from the team and not allowed them to practice, lift, or meet with the team until their punishment was over, and then compete for their spot again.  It allows them to continue to be students.  It does not allow them to continue being football players."

Seriously, what people fail to realize is that these programs have coaches who actually take the idea of ""saving"" kids from their situations pretty seriously. The idea that the coaches are these ogres who could not care less about their players as people or what happens to them is so far off base as to be the opinion of a child.  Jimbo Fisher has given his own money to former players who have needed to travel to schools after getting kicked from FSU or try to get jobs somewhere. Nick Saban a few years ago ranted about people slamming him for giving second and third chances to players. Saban's thesis was essentially, ""This kid would be in prison or dead if he wasn't here, so shove it.""  If people really watched CFB because the kids are such great students it would be more like the national spelling bee.

CFB,3dpaja,Drunken_Wanderer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:30 2015 UTC,Any potential link/story on that? I'm just always curious about this kind of backstory.
CFB,3dpaja,pramirez184,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"Here you go.     Foster said the young receivers ""talk about next year all the time,"" while staying focused on the task at hand. For the 6-foot-3 rising sophomore from Monaca, Pa., he listed a few areas to improve before spring practice.  It started with footwork, but he also said he needed to be ""more coachable"" moving forward.  ""Take coaching to another level basically by listening and taking their advice, basically,"" he said. ""Sometimes, I feel like I do my own thing. But at the end, the coaches are always right. So I just need to take the coaching more serious."""
CFB,3dpaja,garownsu01,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:38 2015 UTC,That might actually be a good thing in a way. It seemed like Sims only looked for Cooper last year. So maybe we will spread the ball around more and make defenses pay attention to more than one receiver.
CFB,3dpaja,rebelde_sin_causa,3,Sat Jul 18 04:25:07 2015 UTC,"One can hope. My offensive expectations for 2015 are low. But we do have a solid looking OL, so some good things are possible."
CFB,3dpaja,garownsu01,5,Sat Jul 18 09:26:04 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited to see how the offense turns out. It's going to be awesome having Kenyan back. We also have 2 solid(from what I can tell) receivers in Foster and Stewart.  And to be honest, I'm not that worried about QB because Coker and Cornwell are both capable of leading this team, in my opinion."
CFB,3dpaja,rebelde_sin_causa,2,Sat Jul 18 13:18:24 2015 UTC,Stewart is solid.... the rest of the receivers I dunno yet.... dunno if there's anybody who can be more than just solid.... just a lot of unknowns right now
CFB,3dpaja,bbbws,2,Sat Jul 18 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"Chris Black is the guy I'm going to be watching.  Stewart is good. Foster has a chance to be good.  Black is explosive, and I think he has a chance to score a lot on some of those fly and post routes that Cooper had so much success running."
CFB,3dpaja,garownsu01,2,Sat Jul 18 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Chris is going to bring some much needed experience to the receiving corp. The reason I said Foster and Stewart is because of the stats they put up during the spring game. Stewart had 8 catches for 118 yards and 2 TDs. Foster had 6 catches for 125 yards. Chris Black had 2 catches for 13 yards."
CFB,3dpaja,bbbws,3,Sat Jul 18 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"Truth. The lack of experience is concerning, but there is talent. I don't think it will be as rough as folks think. Especially since Coker/ Cornwell have been running with this corps as second team offense for a year now."
CFB,3dpaja,garownsu01,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it'll be too bad. The biggest thing I'm worried about on offense is depth at running back."
CFB,3dpaja,WrongWayBo,3,Sat Jul 18 15:40:18 2015 UTC,My offensive expectations for 2015 are high. I think people are sleeping on us.

CFB,3dpaja,ArDariusStewart13,6,Sat Jul 18 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"Is this really a surprise? This is just how Saban runs his team. Hell, we landed the number one prospect in the country last season in D'Shawn Hand and I don't think he played more than 30 snaps. Robert Foster was a 5 star WR prospect and ArDarius Stewart was the number one athlete in the nation coming out of high school. They will get their time when it's their turn, until then, veterans will start over them. Unless you're as talented as Cooper or Cam Robinson who both started as freshman"
CFB,3dpaja,ComfortablyNumbLoL,4,Sat Jul 18 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"SC has a very similar situation. Other than Pharoh Cooper, the leading returning receiver has like 4 catches. And we Don't have a bunch of 5 star recruits that can come off the bench whenever"
CFB,3dpaja,SpeedxKills,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:22:23 2015 UTC,"We're very similar. We lost our top 3 players in receptions and return 1 WR that has significant experience, Juju Smith who was a 17 year old true freshmen in 2014. Then no one else has significant experience. I think our next leading player in receptions is CB Adoree Jackson. We'll be relying a lot on incoming JC transfers this year and sophomore Steven Mitchell who's still rebounding from an ACL injury in 2013."

CFB,3dpaja,polydorr,4,Sat Jul 18 16:26:45 2015 UTC,This is part of why Alabama has been called an underdog even though it's such a weird term to use for them. So much talent but it has to be developed and proven.  Is this going to be the youngest team of starters Saban has fielded so far? It feels that way.
CFB,3dpaja,infernofusion11,3,Sat Jul 18 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly this team is a good combination of veterans and some youngsters. The front 7 will be one of the best in the SEC, if not one of the best in the country. The secondary in my opinion can only get better especially with how bad it looked against Auburn and Ohio state. The offensive line will be solid this year. Drake is coming back so Henry and Drake will be running and running a lot. And the QB and WR situation I think it'll be slow at first but as the season progresses will see more of what the offense can do. Or lane kiffin is that good and this offense doesn't lose a step."
CFB,3dpaja,Awesometom100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:58:08 2015 UTC,The secondary in my opinion can only get better especially with how bad it looked against Auburn and Ohio state.   You don't know the pain of a bad secondary. It can get worse.... much worse.
CFB,3dpaja,BlackNotesIII,0,Sat Jul 18 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will get worse! Our CBs apart from Cyrus were bad and young last year, which should be much improved this year. As well as having more solid coaching back there. Losing Collins will hurt at safety but we have enough people I think that can step in and are good enough in different packages. Ronnie Harrison is going to be a monster back there too."
CFB,3dpaja,Awesometom100,2,Sat Jul 18 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"No no no... I'm not saying it will, I'm just saying it can definitely get worse... Far worse than those games."
CFB,3dpaja,BlackNotesIII,0,Sat Jul 18 19:00:32 2015 UTC,I don't think so! Unless you are somehow saying that JJ is going to shred us or something.
CFB,3dpaja,Awesometom100,2,Sat Jul 18 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"No. I am not. I'm just saying it is in fact possible to have a worse secondary. You guys are used to really good teams that you don't know what it's like anymore to have anything besides special teams be bad. I have seen awful secondary, you guys were just mediocre."
CFB,3dpaja,BlackNotesIII,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"Well of course it is possible, I'm just saying I don't think it is possible to be worse with the athletes we have back there. Last year was definitely a low point, all teams had to do was be like ""fuck it throw it deep!"" and get at least 2 TDs a game."

CFB,3dpaja,Okstate2039,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm skeptical, and think people are drinking the kool aid when they say Alabama is gonna go undefeated and win the national championship and they deserve to be in the pre-season top 5.  Their secondary is weak, and they lost a lot of talent at offense.  I think they lose at least 2 games.  Edit: and this is why I don't comment in this sub much anymore. The Downvote button shouldn't be a disagree button. There are major fanbases that run this sub, and God help you if you do anything but circlejerk to how awesome they are..."
CFB,3dpaja,lets_go_b0wling,8,Sat Jul 18 04:10:30 2015 UTC,I think anyone in their right minds wouldn't count on Bama going undefeated and winning it all this early on. Pre-season top 5 for sure but no guarantees after that.
CFB,3dpaja,rebelde_sin_causa,5,Sat Jul 18 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"I don't even think the preseason top 5 is justified, the ones I see us at #2 strike me as ridiculous..... I think we're getting that just because our name is Alabama........ but I also see a couple other teams in the top 10 who I don't think belong"
CFB,3dpaja,bbbws,3,Sat Jul 18 09:37:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think this season, we'll be fielding the best roster since our 2012 team.  We're missing key contributors at some positions, but overall talent at every position makes me optimistic.  The team is inexperienced, but they'll have a good chance to grow up early in the season.  If they respond, it could be a season similar to 2008. Beat Clemson and Georgia early in big games and rode that momentum to the sec championship game. If they figure it our against Wisconsin and beat Ole Miss, Should be a good opportunity for us.  October is pretty brutal for us.  If we only drop one of those, which is a big if, we'll be in good shape."

CFB,3dpaja,WrongWayBo,0,Sat Jul 18 09:33:43 2015 UTC,You realize Saban made a comment that Coker won the job but sims won the team right? Meaning the best qb didn't even play and you saw what we did. People are over thinking this way too much.
CFB,3dpaja,rebelde_sin_causa,2,Sat Jul 18 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"I never heard that..... what I've seen of Coker on the field hasn't caused me apprehension, just a lot of unknown still since he hasn't played much...... no doubt that if there's a coach who can win with average QB play it is Saban"
CFB,3dpaja,WrongWayBo,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:30 2015 UTC,That's what Marcus spears was claiming on finebaum. His skillet is 10+ yards. Similar to mett. I think Coker is going to be good

We hear about it every time Justin Bieber farts, and we'll hear about every arrest or accusation against top teams. ESPN has to have a villain, and right now it's FSU. When they either lose enough for people to stop caring, or something more juicy cones along, the media will lose interest. There's no such thing as an untarnished reputation when you win titles.

But maybe I'm just mistaken, or maybe it was only for national games and they were always ""MSU"" when regionally broadcast  *edit   Just wanted to further Michigan States claim as I found we hold a 2-1-1 edge over Mississippi St in the all time series, with a 46-33 advantage in scoring, wooooo. I actually really loved looking at the overall series though, as it's pretty interesting. Three of the four games were in East Lansing where not only did each team have a win, but one was a 7-0 game (in favor of Michigan State), and another was a 6-0 win for Mississippi St with the third game in EL ending in a 6-6 tie. Found 1 shutout each and a tie pretty cool. The only other game was at a neutral field in Jackson, MS, and Michigan St won 33-19. I also though it was pretty cool all the games were back to backs, ex 1928/29, 1946/47. Would've been kinda neat had both schools kept playing regularly since we're both pretty big land grant schools and what not, and even now share the same initials. What if both teams met on a regular basis in the ""MSU Classic"" and the winning team got the rights to go by ""MSU"" until next time, that'd be pretty fun eh"

CFB,3dmlok,wahoowawa,12,Fri Jul 17 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"If it wasn't roughing the passer it was just going to be something worse.  He went helmet-to-helmet (driving up into Teddy's chin) after the pass was released and when he had an unobstructed, open-field tackle.  If that happened under the new rules he could've been ejected."
CFB,3dmlok,LOLmodel,2,Fri Jul 17 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"I might need to brush up on the rules, to be honest.  However, this link shows a slightly different perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFfLMsH2gQg  Hits Teddy at the peak of his stride (doesn't drive up aside from his natural gait), hits not even a split second after release (do you see how fast they are both moving?), and leverages body into chest, not  into chin.   I'm probably wrong, but I'll stand fast and say in 2011 that should have been clean."
CFB,3dmlok,wahoowawa,6,Fri Jul 17 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"He might leverage his body into his chest, but he clearly also goes helmet into chin.  This is even clearer in your video and is the only reason Teddy's helmet goes flying.  You are right about the timing but there's no reason for that kind of hit on a QB in open field.  Also, game was in 2013 not 2011."
CFB,3dmlok,LOLmodel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Correct, I brainfart good.   And I don't think that's the only way a helmet flies off but I don't know enough to discredit you.

CFB,3dmlok,wahoowawa,3,Fri Jul 17 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's possible for the helmet to come off in many ways... But I don't even understand what the debate here is.  We're looking at video from several angles of Bostic hitting Teddy in the chin with his head, and his helmet comes off after.  How is this up for argument?"
CFB,3dmlok,LOLmodel,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:50:06 2015 UTC,"Watching the video, I still don't believe he's targeting the head. It's at most a lightly glancing blow that looks more severe since the force applied would shove Teddy's head forward.   Someone else posted that he led with the crown of his helmet, which I do see. So it is a penalty."
CFB,3dmlok,wahoowawa,2,Fri Jul 17 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"Lightly glancing blow?  I don't get it, man."
CFB,3dmlok,LOLmodel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm no ref, but you don't need to ""target the head"" if you lead with the crown of your helmet and hit someones helmet, or whatever the cut off zone is now - which you acknowledge - afaik. He's supposed to lead head up (proper tackling form and all), and he's responsible for that no matter how ticky-tacky it seems; though I doubt you would call it a ""lightly glancing blow"" if the same hit was delivered on you by the same player. Also, above all he didn't have to/shouldn't have hit him since the ball was already gone...I know football is a physical game, and can be a violent one. I also know how fast it is at this level...but he pretty clearly wanted the hit and didn't try to avoid it at all. No grey area in that call imo, from a totally impartial aspect"
CFB,3dmlok,RedCedarRage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:32 2015 UTC,That hit was unnecessarily high but I that there is completely a reason for hitting a QB like that in the open field.   I want my defense to hit the QB cleanly but as hard as possible. There is a ton of value in a hit like that as opposed to a polite tackle. Make him think twice about rolling out. Make him second guess holding onto the ball that extra second.
CFB,3dmlok,Throw_away_dot_com,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"There is a ton of value in a hit like   As a fan, I agree. But trying to think like a coach/player I don't think there is as much value as in a case like this, as that would probably be roughing the passer more times than not(even w/o helmet contact) - and at that point youre gambling shaking him up mentally, or changing their gameplan, vs penalty yards, free downs, etc. Probably better avenues to take, especially against a QB whos likely headed the the NFL, and probably won't easily break mentally (nor will the coaches be likely to change the play calls to no roll outsor anything)"
CFB,3dmlok,RedCedarRage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:57:58 2015 UTC,Yeah at the end of the day it should have been lower

CFB,3dmlok,theshnig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Right, that's why I am saying it's questionable, not a fraud haha. Imagine if he hit 2 inches lower. Full chest, no glancing blow from the whiplash. It'd be cut and dry. I still think this one is still wrong to call for 15."
CFB,3dmlok,wahoowawa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:28 2015 UTC,He lowered his head and led with the crown of his helmet.  It is pretty cut and dry.  That hit happens today and it is an ejection.

But as the game went on they really couldnt do anything, and I dont think it prepared us at all - and it seemed like their whole defense was getting a bit dirty grabbing ankles and stuff after every play (Langford did tweak his that game), and the diving late ""tackle"" into Cooks knee (though IIRC that was a bit later than the first drive). Definitely glad the coaches/training staff had braces on as a preventative measure though - paid off big time there."

That said, there were other teams ranked higher than both UM and VaT that were passed up as at large bids. This was one of the stupidest, and more open, selections based purely on money.

I mean on a list of ""legit"" wins it has to be at, or near, the bottom of the barrel.  Neither team won their division, shoot UM didn't even play in the B1G championship game. It was the lowest ranked BCS at large match up ever #11 VaT v 13 UM, & arguably the weakest (from their body of work) at large match up too. And all because the shenanigans with the SEC NCG and the Sugar Bowl committee passing over teams like #8 K State, #7 Boise St and #12 Baylor (cant remember if Stanford was passed over as well, or if the Fiesta had the first pick); all to pander for views. And then of course it went on to be one of the worst executed, and least watched, BCS games. Legit? And VaT might have good history as a program, but that year you couldn't really call them a good team with their schedule, and losses, imo.

CFB,3dpwxc,SharksFanAbroad,10,Sat Jul 18 08:15:51 2015 UTC,That'd be a legit match up.

I'm not sure if that means we would keep both on our schedule or if we would only play 1. I'm sure our athletic department sees playing Baylor as more appealing because we recruit Texas a lot and they were SWC opponents.   Either way, I'm happy with our scheduling. It's nice to see Baylor trying to make changes to theirs."

CFB,3dpwxc,Might_be_right,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:09 2015 UTC,Baylor doesn't want to play two games in Dallas. I don't know how many schools play two neutral games a year but I think finding a P5 team isn't hard. However I think we're getting stuck at negotiations with how we do the Home/Home. Like when we scheduled Buffalo we did a H/H/A. I have a feeling we are just trying to make a fair series.
CFB,3dpwxc,KsigCowboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:22 2015 UTC,I get that they don't want to but arky is Jerry's baby.  I'm tired of waiting for home and homes.  Give me a neutral site over the shit we've been going to.

CFB,3do7s9,OGSnowflake,45,Fri Jul 17 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well it was the University of California Southern Branch for a while.  It seems like a lot of people don't get the UC nomenclature. All of the campuses are: University of California, 'city they are in'. This is due to restructuring in the '50s when control of the university passed from Berkeley to the President of the University of California, which became the separate governing entity. After the restructuring all of the schools became full university campuses in their own right, for good reason, and the naming reflects that. UC Irvine, the sixth best UC according to US News, would be the flagship public school in all but California, Virginia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia.  Berkeley is allowed to use the name 'University of California' for athletics because we were first, bitches."
CFB,3do7s9,rambouhh,11,Fri Jul 17 22:58:18 2015 UTC,It's always interesting to me to see how few people outside of California know about all the UC schools. Some of them are the best campuses and schools out there
CFB,3do7s9,frankasaurusrex,16,Sat Jul 18 03:28:09 2015 UTC,I think it is because in almost every other state the schools with the city after them are usually commuter or not as elite as the flagship.

Trying to use your logic for that season overrules every national champion that ever lost a single game.

Maybe VT should have played Oregon for the NC to make sure they weren't the best."

My point was that once you get to the threshold of comparing teams in that top tier based on their total season performance, you can look at specific game results to do fine comparisons. It's essentially what we use playoffs for: once you determine the set of teams who are potentially the best in the country, you force head to head results to determine who is named the best."
CFB,3do6vc,ExternalTangents,2,Sat Jul 18 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. So compare Ok state and Bama. Ok state lost to iowa state late in the season. Bama lost to one of the most dominant regular season teams in a long time, who also beat the PAC champs, big east co-champs, and SEC east champs by large margins, and Bama just got better from that loss onwards. If you watch the first game, Bama was the better team and would have won if the kicker didn't play the worst game of his life. The NC game was no surprise. The game was played the same way, except the FGs weren't missed that time around. I'm not saying it was fair, but the two best teams in the nation played in the NCG that year."
CFB,3do6vc,feldor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not really interested in debating the merits of those two teams (nor the validity of the first Alabama-LSU game). Suffice it to say that looking only at the teams' losses is woefully insufficient for comparing them, and that while I'm not firmly in the Alabama camp, I'm also not firmly in the Oklahoma State camp either. Anyone who thinks the choice between those two teams, based on their full resumes, is an obvious one is operating with some sort of bias."

He would frequently flash his hard-on for the SEC and tell players that they could never compete at that level, let alone in the NFL. He once told a room full of Southern Miss boosters that Jamie Collins would never play a down in the SEC. Jamie Collins is now a Super Bowl Champion. He would demoralize his teams from the inside out. How he could expect success from a group of boys he was calling inferior, the world may never know.  TL;DR: I hate Ellis Johnson and you should too."

CFB,3do6vc,Throw_away_dot_com,37,Sat Jul 18 00:04:08 2015 UTC,"From a PURELY COMPETITIVE standpoint (so not talking about money, branding, TV ratings, etc), I can reasonably make the case that TCU was an upgrade for the Big 12 over the departing Texas A&M.   From about 2005 (the year that TCU joined the MWC) to the point that conference realignment happened, TCU was consistently in the Top 10 (2005, 2008, 2009, 2010) with another season just outside of it (2011).  They went to two BCS bowls and won a Rose Bowl in an undefeated year where they ended up ranked #2 in the country.  Before 2012, A&M hadn't finished in the Top 10 since Bill Clinton was ""the new guy"", went to one BCS bowl in 1998 (and lost), and win a conference title after 1998.  The obvious caveat here being the level of competition in the MWC being less than the competition in the Big 12, which I readily admit. Since moving to the SEC, A&M had an amazing 2012 season, beating Alabama and having a Heisman trophy winner...but even at their best still hasn't so much as won their division.  Best finish since moving to the SEC is their #5 finish in 2012.  Despite playing an extra conference game, TCU won the Big 12 in 2014 (sharing it with Baylor) and finished ranked #3. Obviously any response is going to address 2012 and 2013's TCU teams, and there certainly have been growing pains.  Should be noted that in 2012 (when from a talent perspective we were stocked with MWC players), we were ranked in the teens before losing our starting QB (who was leading the nation in passing efficiency at the time) and we didn't have the depth to replace him (and lost most of our games within 1 score).  2013 was bad, no doubt about that. Taking the two together, it appears that A&M started off strong and regressed, whereas TCU started off mediocre and improved. In other sports, our basketball team is...I'm not even sure we have one, A&M's is decent-to-good with CBI and NIT bids each of the last two years.  College baseball is where TCU shines though, earning trips to the College World Series each of the last two years, and in 2014 getting there by virtue of their Super-Regional win over...Texas A&M."

This allowed FSU to squeak past a paper Tiger for their Natty.  I could argue FSU benefitted from playing the weakest conference schedule in recent memory and even though they beat top 10 Clemson and Miami, the only reason those teams were ranked so high is because they were playing against garbage all season.  I'm not saying FSU wasn't good, but their blow out victories weren't worth much when compared to more competitive conferences.  Clemson's only good win that year was the Orange Bowl and I believe they were playing an Ohio State team that had quit on the season.  I could argue it is reasonable to think that Alabama, MSU, OSU, or Stanford would have beaten FSU if they had replaced Auburn in the title game.     Edit: Before I get down voted I'd like to clarify that I think FSU undoubtedly deserved to play in the title game, just that their season had them overrated and they got lucky playing Auburn."

Others NFL guys make arguments for Deion, Ronnie Lott, Dick Butkus, Deacon Jones, Doug Atkins, etc, but I don't have time to get into them here.  Like I said before, I think LT is the best and there are NFL guys that agree with me, but it is far from a consensus opinion. Lots of it depends on your criteria."
CFB,3do6vc,RobertNeyland,3,Fri Jul 17 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"If you add the sacks Reggie had while he was in the USFL, (23.5) he holds the all time sack record for professional football. As it stands he's ranked 2nd for all-time NFL sacks, and only by 2 sacks. So add in the first two years Reggie was a pro and he becomes the leader with a 21.5 sack lead on the next closest dude (Bruce Smith). The Minister of Defense was crazy dominant."
CFB,3do6vc,70stang,9,Sat Jul 18 03:43:01 2015 UTC,"I can reasonably argue that USC was three plays from winning five-straight national titles.  Play #1: 4th & 2 vs. Texas with 2 minutes left. If LenDale picks it up, SC can run out the clock and finish the '3-Pete'.  Play #2: Batted down 2-point conversion vs. Oregon State in 2006. This is by far the biggest stretch of the three. SC was down 33-10 late in the third quarter but scored three consecutive TDs including a pass to Steve Smith with 7 seconds left to make it 33-31. Despite all of the momentum, SC couldn't convert because JD Booty's pass to Dwayne Jarrett was batted down. Beavers win 33-31. Had SC converted, I'm convinced they win overtime, but we'll never know. Because of this, USC had a 10-1 record going into the UCLA game on the last week of the year and lost, giving 12-1 Florida a chance in the title game. I can reasonable argue that a 11-1 USC team that was previously 11-0 might have beat out Florida in the BCS standings. There was precedence for that, with 2003 Oklahoma losing on the last week of the year and still getting a ticket to the title game over an equally 1-loss USC team. Like Florida, SC would've steamrolled Ohio State in the title game. That's 4-straight titles.  Play #3: 4th & Goal at the 5 vs. Stanford in 2007.  If Tavita Pritchard doesn't throw his rainbow pass for a TD, USC finishes the season 11-1 and are the only one-loss team in the nation not named Ohio State. Like two-loss LSU, USC would've steamrolled Ohio State in the title game. That's 5-straight titles.  You could then go hyper-crazy and say that if the CFB Playoff existed in 2008, USC could've won 6, but let's be real...this scenario is far fetched as it is and Alabama can probably do the same since 2011."
CFB,3do6vc,sportingglobe,5,Fri Jul 17 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"I agree Alabama could make an argument. That's only 4 In a row though since 2011.

CFB,3do6vc,Hobodownthestreet,2,Sat Jul 18 09:01:32 2015 UTC,"For me, it was Steve Young. When you consider the time he played during. The talent or lack of he had around him. What he was able to do, I have to go with Steve Young, then I think is Barry Sanders, followed by Jim Brown. But I can't go with Peyton, hell of a player, top 5 QB of all time, but when you factor in his record in the playoffs and especially during the biggest game of the sport, I cannot agree with him. Part of the reason why I have such a hard time anointing Aaron Rodgers the best player right now, cause his playoff records is spotty."
CFB,3do6vc,iclimbnaked,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:39 2015 UTC,You just clearly weigh playoff games very heavily then. Which means I assume you think MJ and Kobe are both better all time than Lebron? It just depends on how you weigh things. If you just look at all time stats its easy to argue Peyton Manning is up there in top offensive players of all time.
CFB,3do6vc,Hobodownthestreet,2,Sat Jul 18 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"First off, as far as basketball goes, MJ is the goat and this is coming from a long suffering Knicks fan. No other athlete has cause me more pain than him, so I got no love for him. Peyton's number in the playoffs while are good are misleading too. For example, the Super Bowl against the Seahawks, he set all kinds of records, but everyone that saw that game saw that Peyton couldn't hang with the Seahawks defense. And really, me saying he is a top 5 QB of all-time, that's high praise, but I just think is too far fetch to say he is the all time best when you put him against Montana, Brady, and Young. Okay, your life is on the line and you can pick any QB ever to be the QB for a squad you can assemble, would you pick Peyton? I wouldn't, his name wouldn't even cross my mind."

Peyton's a student of the game and a damn fine chess player at that. No knock on him.   But in my book, as far as winning QB's, I might even have Peyton at #3 behind Brady and Brett Favre."
CFB,3do6vc,huskermut,5,Sat Jul 18 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can reasonably argue the greatest offensive or defensive player in the NFL. You can say one of the greatest but it's simply not quantifiable. Sure there's completion percentage, yardage, touchdowns scored, etc but what trully defines greatness.  Is it the most championships or the most touchdowns scored or....? The list can go on and on. Also you're comparing players from different eras of the game. Defense would be a little easier to come to a consensus about. But you say Reggie White, I say JJ Watt. We could argue about it all day. So I'll just agree to disagree and say they're some of the greatest players in NFL history."
CFB,3do6vc,huskermut,9,Fri Jul 17 21:55:30 2015 UTC,I think you possibly missed my point.  Just a hunch though.

CFB,3do6vc,GiovanniElliston,5,Sat Jul 18 18:06:50 2015 UTC,2004 Auburn deserved to be in the National Title game over Oklahoma.
CFB,3do6vc,ghetto_draco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:48:41 2015 UTC,Why?
CFB,3do6vc,frogstomp427,4,Sat Jul 18 04:26:34 2015 UTC,"Auburn had 4 wins over teams ranked in the top-25 at the end of the season. LSU #14, Tenn #15, UGA #6, & Tenn #15 (Tenn-2 was SEC title game).  Oklahoma had only 2 wins over teams ranked at end of season Texas #6, & Texas A&M #22. ~ It's worth noting in 20/20 hindsight, that same Texas A&M team got waxed by Tenn in a bowl game, but they didn't know that when they selected the bowls.  Auburn was also considered a tougher SOS.   There is also the fact that for some strange reason, the BCS polls had an undeniable love-affair with Oklahoma during the early 2000's.  Just 1 season before, in 2003, Oklahoma lost the conference title game & was still selected over USC to player LSU in the national title game.   2004 was a classic example of the BCS refusing to re-question itself based on current information.  They had USC #1 & Oklahoma #2 at the beginning of the season & no matter what happened they weren't going to change that unless they lost ~ regardless of resume's.  EDIT  Took some time to get my stats together, but my point still stands, late as it may be."
CFB,3do6vc,KenTrojan,2,Sat Jul 18 05:06:19 2015 UTC,"the BCS polls had an undeniable love-affair with Oklahoma during the early 2000's.

CFB,3do6vc,Awesometom100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:53:39 2015 UTC,"Just a matter of personal opinion.  I watched a ton of College football that year, and made my decision on who deserved to be in based on what I saw before me.  The Oklahoma hype train was up to speed as usual, and also as usual it came off the tracks in spectacular fashion.  Auburn played more quality opponents throughout the year.  They defeated then ranked, #5, 8, 9, 10, & 15.  Oklahoma beat #5, 20 and 22 during the season.    More or less a judgement call based on the level of play versus quality opponents."
CFB,3do6vc,rebelde_sin_causa,2,Sat Jul 18 04:42:35 2015 UTC,"I see. I was just a kid at that point so I didn't exactly have critical thinking skills when it came to football. I just knew that Oklahoma was very good and that it should have been an epic matchup. Hell, even to this day it's obvious that that Oklahoma team was extremely talented and it often gets washed out in the noise because of how badly they were shellacked.   Do you think Auburn was the better team by a wide margin? Also, do you think the outcome is much different if the Tigers were there that night rather than the Sooners?"
CFB,3do6vc,nelsonassassin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:54:10 2015 UTC,Some family member of mine think we would have beaten you. I'm unsure.  I am however positive we would have been the toughest game you guys played all year and it would have been within two scores.

CFB,3do4g4,chevyboxer,4,Sat Jul 18 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree, respectfully of course. Big 12 wouldn't nearly make as big a deal about it if every conference didn't hold ""having to play a conference championship game"" over our heads. It's a natural response that is typically more discussed when you hear that the Big12 didn't play a CCG we point out that we still play as many or more P5 teams than the other conferences.   for instance. ATM only played 9 P5 teams last year. TCU played 11.  Even if aggie had made it to the CCG they still would have played one less P5 team.   It's important to keep in mind when discussing the Big12"
CFB,3do4g4,Might_be_right,-1,Sat Jul 18 13:03:16 2015 UTC,When the G5s that other conferences play can beat some of the Big 12s P5 teams that's not really a thing to be proud of. Not to mention we fixed our schedule. Baylor still hasn't. Even with our 8 conference games our strength of schedule was tougher than Baylor or TCU.
CFB,3do4g4,bearinfw,3,Sat Jul 18 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's the same number of Power 5 games for most Big 12 teams. If MSST had won the west they would have only played 9 total P5 teams (the same amount as Baylor with no P5 on the OOC schedule). School like Texas, OU, KSU, Iowa, TCU, Tech, WVU, ect all played 10 P5 teams last year. Texas actually played 11 if you consider BYU P5 like we do with ND."

The problem is that BYU has been living off that decade for all these years. Hard to say they are disrespected when they get the benefit of the doubt due to something they did 20 to 30 years ago.   Today, BYU, beyond their fan support, has done little to out shine other schools. They don't put players into the NFL anymore, they're not revolutionizing offenses, they're not consistently winning 10 games and, in the BCS era, they failed to even make a BCS bowl - let alone produce an undefeated season. Meanwhile, in that same stretch, Utah, TCU and BSU had undefeated seasons, those three, with Hawaii, Northern Illinois and UCF, all busted the BCS. The Utes and Frogs were able to jump to the P5. Boise managed to play in another major bowl game...and BYU lost to Memphis in a Miami Beach Bowl remembered more for a brawl than anything else.  So, what exactly again, sets em apart? Okay. They loaded up their schedule with some tough opponents on the road. Cool, you know who else did that? USU back when they were independent during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Big whoop."

Yet, despite all that success, as an independent the Cougars still have to fight just to be considered as a ""Power Five"" non-conference opponents by the Power Five conferences.

The ACC and SEC have recognized BYU as such because a) it's not in a G5 conference and b) it's a quality program.

CFB,3do52t,pierdonia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see them as any different than a good G5 team because of their schedule (maybe not entirely true, sort of an in between).  Being an independent doesn't give you an out if you still have a schedule that isn't near the level of a P5 team.  If we went solely off it being a quality program, then I guess we should exclude some P5 schools and include some G5 schools.  But no they go off the criteria of them being P5 teams, and what's consistent between all those teams?  They play in a conference with P5 teams and play them 8+ times."

CFB,3do52t,dead_cats_everywhere,2,Sat Jul 18 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"Can you point me to where the linked article states as much? Because the only mention of Boise that ctrl-F turned up is:   Also unsurprisingly? Boise State leads all Group of Five programs with 69 wins.   Did you read that and think it meant Boise has 69 wins against P5 teams in the last 6 years, meaning that they have played 11.5 P5 teams per year in that span and have beaten more P5 teams than Ohio State, FSU, Stanford, or LSU in the same period? It's saying they have the most wins overall of any G5 program."
CFB,3do52t,pierdonia,3,Sat Jul 18 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"You're correct, I read it too quickly. I can admit when I make a mistake, unlike the 1984 voters. Oh well, felt dirty defending BSU anyway."
CFB,3do52t,dead_cats_everywhere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I believe that over the last decade, Boise has a slightly better win percentage against P5 teams, but only slightly -- both are at about .500."

The media reported it like BYU screwed the pooch by trying to big time the BIG 12. I don't have any insider info, but they sure made it sound like Holmoe and gang may have burned some bridges."
CFB,3do52t,dead_cats_everywhere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any actual evidence that BYU had any missteps. Maybe they did, but Neinas denied that BYU made any demands or that Sunday play or BYUtv kept the school out:  http://www.vanquishthefoe.com/byu-cougars-football/2015/4/29/8517769/chuck-neinas-just-demolished-byu-to-big-12-expansion-narrative  Holmoe generally seems on top of things, so until I see evidence BYU mishandled things, I'll just assume claims about BYU's demands are part of the echo chamber that seems to contain all things expansion-related. Healthier for me that way."
CFB,3do52t,pierdonia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff. Just goes to show how honest the media is. I'm an out of stater, and I can tell you that everything I saw or read painted the talks in a very different picture than what may have apparently happened. As a Utah fan I cannot say that I hope you guys end up in a P5 conference, but my non-biased side thinks BYU winds up going to the BIG 12 during the next expansion series. It just makes sense."
CFB,3do52t,dead_cats_everywhere,36,Sat Jul 18 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Look. Mizzou probably belongs on the list. But in terms of not getting enough credit, their last conference championship was almost 50 years ago. In the Big 12 they never even won the division outright out of the 3 times they did.   They're clearly in the weaker division of the SEC, like they were in the big 12. And just to illustrate that, the SECE hasn't won a championship since 08, and the only game since then that hasn't been a blowout was 2012 when georgia came extremely close to beating bama. Mizzou has lost by 17 and 29 points in their appearances  they have a losing bowl record. They've lost by at least two touchdowns in every conference championship game they've been in  So while they may be underrated, they don't exactly have the feats to back up demands for more respect"
CFB,3do52t,Magnus77,10,Fri Jul 17 22:33:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call the 2013 SEC Championship a blowout. It was back-and-forth until Auburn pulled away un the fourth quarter.
CFB,3do52t,TommyLaStella,4,Sat Jul 18 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"Really, Mizzou kept it close most of last year's game too, Bama just piled it on at the end."
CFB,3do52t,DkS_FIJI,6,Sat Jul 18 05:09:02 2015 UTC,"Well he mostly talks about recent history and in the last 10 years the team has one their division half the time, and are 5-3 in bowl games. Top 5 in wins since 2007.  He's not making a list of the under-rated teams likely to win the national championship he talks about how when you talk about winning the division, Missouri is rarely talked about."
CFB,3do52t,JumpingPotato1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:48 2015 UTC,Seemed to base it off how well they were expected to finish in conference.
CFB,3do52t,DkS_FIJI,-3,Sat Jul 18 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"And how has the SEC East been other than Missouri the last three years? Florida's been shitty. Tennessee has been equally crappy. SC has been ok at points but not stellar. And your one win against Georgia was when they were without all their skill players.   And in the meantime you've managed to avoid playing Alabama, Auburn, and LSU in the regular season each of those years. When you have played any of those teams you've lost by multiple touchdowns. For as much as your fans have bitched about Kansas benefiting from a cupcake schedule in 2007 you guys have been just as big of beneficiaries if not more. And you haven't even consistently proved yourself against your weak non-conference opponents like Indiana."
CFB,3do52t,The_Tic-Tac_Kid,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really feel that strongly about this. I'm good as long as our program doesn't go in reverse. But I seem to remember us getting picked in the middle of the pack even in the weak division. Also I remember a stretch there where the narrative was almost always ""____ is looking good this may be the weak Mizzou loses"" and then we'd win. It was especially weird after we beat Arkansas, before the game they were the hot young team in the country who shutout two teams in a row and were jiving and were supposed to kill us at home, then we beat them and all of a sudden it was ""oh, Mizzou beat a .500 team? Not impressed.""  But for the most part, I think for the most part we're pretty fairly rated. If we want more respect I'd rather we earn it handily rather than ask for it. And honestly I like Mizzou in a bit of an underdog role."
CFB,3do52t,BLUNTforDANVERS,0,Sat Jul 18 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"Excuse me but since joining the SEC We have played Alabama twice, Auburn on their best year since we joined the conference, and Texas A&M with a Heisman winner, I don't care what anyone says, those are great loses. We also played Arkansas just after shutting out 2 SEC West teams, Texas A&M with a Heisman winner, and really good Oklahoma State and Minnesota teams. Also in 2013 having to win 5 games in a row to clinch the division and then in 2014 having to win 6 games in a row to clinch it again. All these in a league we weren't supposed to be competitive in for 10 years. What Mizzou has done is nothing short of amazing and we deserve some credit for, but we don't, for some reason when other SEC teams see Missouri on their schedule they think it's a write it down W, they think, ""c'mon it's still Missouri"" but I still like that, I still like being a surprise."
CFB,3do52t,JumpingPotato1,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"Well shit, if all you have to do to win respect is get blown out by top ten teams then Kansas must be one of the most elite teams in the country. I mean not only did we lose to a top ten team last year, we made our game competitive.  It'd be amazing if you'd actually won against good teams, but the only times you've played the teams that give the SEC its reputation, you've lost and it hasn't even been close. Alabama has beaten you buy more than four touchdowns every game you've played against them. Auburn beat you by 17. Georgia beat you by three touchdowns the first time they played you, didn't have any of their skill players the second time, and beat you 34-0 in Columbia without Todd Gurley.   In the last decade you've had two meaningful top ten wins and neither of them came in the SEC or against SEC teams. They were Oklahoma in 2010 and us in 2007. If you want to get credit for being a team that can compete with top level competition, you have to actually be competitive first."
CFB,3do52t,The_Tic-Tac_Kid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:48:22 2015 UTC,"I have never once stated that we could compete with top level competition, which you would know if you read ANYTHING I wrote. My claim was that we can compete with a dumbed down east, but the media and other SEC teams think we are a Vanderbilt or a Kentucky and can't compete, we have and we can. So thanks for posting a bunch of horseshit I already know.  And also that Auburn game was fucking close I don't care what the score reads. It was back and forth all day. Auburn was only up by one going into the 2nd half and 4 going into the 4th quarter, and were even up by 3 for a moment. But the teams give up once it feels un-winnable since its the end of the season."
CFB,3do52t,JumpingPotato1,5,Sat Jul 18 09:12:19 2015 UTC,Is a conference championship the singular metric that the author uses to judge whether a program is disrespected?  There are no other measuring sticks?

In those 17 seasons, the Wildcats have only had a losing record in conference play four times.   This is impressive.  I'm excited for this season even though we are only going to finish 7th in the conference."
CFB,3do52t,willOTW,14,Fri Jul 17 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"Full article (screw your autoplay video):    Respect is not given, it's earned. You've heard that phrase numerous times in your life, and while I wouldn't call the sentiment behind it inaccurate, that doesn't mean it's always true.  Throughout time, there have been plenty of people who deserved respect and never quite got it. The same can be said of college football teams. The teams that tend to do well year after year, but are often discounted and taken for granted. And that's the theme of this week's Friday Five.  I'm going to rank the five programs in college football who are continuously disrespected -- by fans, by the media, and maybe sometimes by their peers. Now, I don't mean the kind of disrespect where they're insulted, or the kind where an Alabama fan thinks you're disrespecting the Tide because you aren't picking them to go undefeated and win every game by at least 30 points.  I just mean the teams we never quite take seriously enough, even when we definitely should.  Let's get to it.  5. Mississippi State: There were so many teams I was stuck choosing between for this fifth spot, but I gave Mississippi State the edge. I fully admit that there's likely some recency bias at play here. I can't sit here and tell you the Bulldogs have been underappreciated for decades. This year, though? This year is a bit different.  Last year, it was widely assumed that the Bulldogs would finish last in the SEC West, maybe sixth. Instead, Mississippi State went out and finished the year 10-3 after starting 9-0. They spent five weeks ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll and were ranked No. 1 in the first edition of the College Football Playoff rankings (there's a trivia question for you in 20 years).  This year the Bulldogs have their Heisman candidate quarterback Dak Prescott returning. So where were they picked to finish in the SEC West by the media at SEC Media Days? In last, of course.  4. BYU: It's been a long time since BYU won its national title in 1984, and a lot has changed for the Cougars since then. In 1998, they left the WAC for the Mountain West, and then after 12 years there they decided to give independence a try in 2011. While there was a bit of a drop off after LaVell Edwards retired and handed the reins to Gary Crowton, since Bronco Mendenhall took over, things have been pretty good. Not national title contender good, but strong nonetheless.  In Mendenhall's 11 seasons, the Cougars have won at least 10 games five times and have only won less than seven games in a season once: a 6-6 campaign in Mendenhall's first season. This year, BYU will play games against Nebraska, UCLA, Michigan, Missouri and Boise State.  Yet, despite all that success, as an independent the Cougars still have to fight just to be considered as a ""Power Five"" non-conference opponents by the Power Five conferences. No, the Cougars don't have the same history of success as Notre Dame, but to lump them together as just another Conference USA or Sun Belt school? Come on. The Cougars should be considered as a ""Power Five"" opponent and there shouldn't have been any questions about it.  3. Georgia Tech: Here's a fun fact about the Yellow Jackets. Since the dawn of the ACC Championship Game in 2005, only six ACC teams have played in the game. Only two teams have appeared in the game more often than Georgia Tech: Florida State and Virginia Tech. The Seminoles and Hokies have played in the game five times. The Yellow Jackets have four appearances. That's right, Florida State has one more appearance in the ACC title game than Georgia Tech does.  The rest of Georgia Tech's division (Duke, North Carolina, Miami, Pitt and Virginia) have combined for one appearance (Duke in 2013). Yet, just about every season when it comes to predicting the Coastal Division, the Yellow Jackets don't get much consideration. Instead, every year we're told this will be the season Miami and North Carolina finally get their acts together, or that Virginia Tech returns to glory.  It won't be the case this year. The Yellow Jackets will probably be the most popular pick in the division coming off the 2014 season, but it's too little too late. I think the biggest problem for the Jackets is that, even though they keep reaching the title game, they've only won it once (2009, and it was later vacated). Still, while the option attack of the Yellow Jackets may not be sexy or exciting, leading to it being discounted as a real threat, this team deserves a lot more respect than it ever seems to get.  2. Kansas State: It just feels like no matter what's happening in the Big 12, Kansas State is continually dismissed as a real title contender in the conference, but yet it feels like the Wildcats are in the hunt every season. Well, at least when Bill Snyder is coaching the team.  Since the formation of the Big 12 in 1996, Snyder has been at the helm of Kansas State for 17 seasons in two different stints. In those 17 seasons, he's won the conference only twice (did have four division titles too), but the Wildcats have won at least 10 games eight times. In those 17 seasons, the Wildcats have only had a losing record in conference play four times.  They may not always be an elite contender, but they're consistently one of the toughest teams in the conference. Whether the two big powers in the conference are Oklahoma and Texas, or Baylor and TCU, the Wildcats are forever a force to be reckoned with. So where were they predicted to finish in the conference this year? Seventh, of course.  1. Missouri: It wasn't all that difficult to figure out who my No. 1 team would be. It was always going to be Missouri. Whether in the Big 12, or now in the SEC, this is just a team that plenty of people just assume is due for a relapse of sorts. It's just, aside from a hiccup here and there, it doesn't happen.  Since 2007, the Tigers have won 10 games or more five times in eight seasons. When Missouri joined the SEC in 2012, it went 5-7 and everybody was gladly telling anyone within earshot about what a mistake it was for the Tigers to leave the Big 12 for the big, bad, SEC, where it would serve as nothing but cannon fodder for years to come.  The Tigers then responded by going 23-5 the last two seasons (14-2 in the SEC) and won the SEC East twice. Still, they are dismissed. Maybe it's because they haven't won the SEC itself (in their two SEC title games they've lost to Alabama and Auburn by a combined score of 101-55), or perhaps it's due to the fact we believe the SEC East to be ""wide open"" every year (meaning anybody can win), but we still refuse to give Mizzou the credit for what it's done.  And it's no different this year. At SEC Media Days, the Tigers were picked to finish third in the SEC East, behind a Tennessee team that hasn't won the SEC East since 2007 and hasn't won more than seven games in any season since then. Makes sense, right?  Honorable Mention: Louisville, Northern Illinois, Arizona, Rutgers"

CFB,3do52t,ComfortablyNumbLoL,3,Sat Jul 18 06:20:12 2015 UTC,It's not really their fault though they had to because the SEC scheduling changed their original OOC. They will get better.
CFB,3do52t,karatechop250,2,Sat Jul 18 09:43:01 2015 UTC,clearly the better team in 2013
CFB,3do52t,GeneralGump,3,Sat Jul 18 18:12:29 2015 UTC,What you didn't watch them blow us out in overtime that year?
CFB,3do52t,Gonzoboner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"I realize that Georgia was better than us last year. We weren't a great team but we won the games we needed to.   2013 though is probably the best football team we've ever had. That squad could have beaten any team in the nation when Franklin was healthy. SC was good that year too, but lost to Georgia and Tennessee, two teams we beat.    If we had a chance at the natty it was 2013. Too bad we ran into a red hot Auburn."

At some point, these clothes were turned in to the athletic department with tags still attached.  The NCAA investigated the incident and told the AD at the time (Current Clemson AD Radakovich) not to tell anyone about the investigation.  The AD decided that Johnson should probably know that his star receiver is the subject of an investigation, and told Johnson, who told Thomas. After the investigation revealed nothing (apparently the interviews were unproductive), the NCAA investigators felt that the investigation was compromised since Thomas had received coaching about the interview.    http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2011/07/georgia-tech-football-ncaa-investigation/1#.VakZaPlVhuA"

A family could argue Coach A's discussion of recruit B cost him undue hardship with pressure from the fan base. Fan bases already do hinky stuff like follow recruits on Twitter and Facebook. At least, the universities can separate themselves from the fan base in these cases. The NCAA is trying to avoid responsibility for said situation as rare as it might be."

I'd say that he shouldn't complain about the rule because all he had to do it follow it, but some reporter probably asked him a question about a non-issue and he was forced to point out how stupid the whole thing is.

CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"Oh cool. We had a dude that had played D-end/OLB for you guys in law school with me. The law school was pretty good at intramural sports those three years, lol.   Congrats on choosing an awesome school, btw. You'll enjoy boulevarding immensely.

CFB,3dn5uc,UNICY,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty excited for the Boulevard, it's definitely different than what I'm used to and waaay more southern. The business school is supposedly top notch though and I'm pumped."
CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,2,Fri Jul 17 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, B school is solid, probably more highly regarded than the law school, I'm pretty sure. Plus, it's in DFW, the fastest growing job market in America, you'll probably have a job lined up after first semester interviews, lol. Up here in Frisco, various business have literally just invested 5 billion bucks into a one mile stretch of road on the tollway, and that's not including all the new business that moved HQ out to Plano recently like Toyota, and I think Chase or something, and several others.   Point being, in terms of job placement, I can't imagine a place being much better than SMU for getting an MBA right now, especially given the potential income:cost of living ratio being ridiculously awesome. I had a buddy move here form LA, and he was like, man, it is literally half as expensive to live in Texas, and you basically get paid like 90 cents on the dollar to what you'd get in LA or San Fran or whatever."
CFB,3dn5uc,UNICY,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Texas native speaking: Everything he just said is wrong. The companies are laying off, the cost of living and housing is high, and the women are definitely not the hottest in the country. Do not move here."

I'll be working through school so I would love to get some better interviews lined up.   The DFW area is great, I knew absolutely nothing about it before moving here from Atlanta and the job market is amazing. Unfortunately, not being a native Texan my network is definitely lacking.

CFB,3dn5uc,UNICY,9,Fri Jul 17 20:34:50 2015 UTC,If I were in his shoes I would finish up at UM and graduate with an amazing degree. Then he has a year to get healthy and then become a graduate transfer. Good luck Ondre!
CFB,3dn5uc,Khakbaugh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"This makes just as much sense. He'll have a year in the system under his belt, so when he hits the field next year he will be 100% ready to go."
CFB,3dn5uc,d_mcc_x,3,Sat Jul 18 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"Except he won't have a Michigan degree and access to a huge Alumni network. Even if his degree is general education, I'm sure some former alumni would have hooked him up with a decent job."
CFB,3dn5uc,Leopoldstrasse,0,Sat Jul 18 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's ridiculous when fans bring up alumni networks as a recruiting pitch. Honestly, what kind of jobs are managers handing out to guys who are probably marginal college students at best with a General Studies degree. It's not like it's the 50's and most players are legitimate students on the side.   I just have a hard time believing any particular 5* DL has taken education seriously and would be a viable employee at a serious job right away. At some point those mystical alumni managers have to answer to the other and higher managers, who don't want to spend an employee spot on a guy who is, at best, barely qualified."
CFB,3dn5uc,StraightRidahs,2,Sat Jul 18 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"Good for him. If he still thinks he can play, and Michigan will grant his release, then it's a win-win for everyone."
CFB,3dn5uc,d_mcc_x,3,Sat Jul 18 00:16:38 2015 UTC,Any particular reason he's leaving or is it just a playing time coach fit thing?
CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,14,Fri Jul 17 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"Doctors wanted him to sit six months after his most recent exam and given his stats he's not going to get a fifth year renewal at Michigan, so that was basically the end of his football career.  Harbaugh pushed for him to take a medical.  Some feel that was to open up space for a grad transfers, others see it more as Pipkins should probably focus on his degree because given his medical history it seems unlikely he cashes a NFL paycheck.  Honestly the transfer is the best of both worlds to some extent.  Now he has to sit for a year and then gets a full year of playing time to show he's fully recovered, and has two years to work on the degree."
CFB,3dn5uc,Cai_E,11,Fri Jul 17 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"If that's the case I'll say the same thing I said during the Jamel Dean saga. I wish the kid the best, I hope he ends up being successful, and I hope even more that he doesn't hurt himself worse chasing a dream."
CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,7,Fri Jul 17 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have sympathy for Pipkins.  I remember when I was his age, every time the trainers gave me an estimate for an injury I just thought ""They're just playing it safe, I'll shave a week or two off that.""  You just think you're indestructible and will always bounce back.  So to have your coach come in and tell you it is over is often going to lead to kids taking it hard.    I'm really just glad he has to sit for a year now due to eligibility.  His first ACL injury was really gruesome, possibly career ending.  He came back from that and a platoon type guy and has been banged up since.  A year of no contact drills only and being able to focus on rehab is the best.  Hopefully he makes a full recovery, is a stud at TT, and goes in an early draft round."

CFB,3dn5uc,lpfortney,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:06:03 2015 UTC,What kind of production can we expect out of him? Has he played somewhat like a 5 star or is he a complete bust?
CFB,3dn5uc,Snow-jizz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"He flashed 5-star potential, but kept getting injured. After his freshman year, it seemed like he was always either on the sidelines or just returning from an injury. If he gets healthy this year, he should be a good (but not all-conference level) contributor in 2016."
CFB,3dn5uc,CavemanBobs,2,Fri Jul 17 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"Pipkins told ESPN in June that he was pressured at Michigan to stop playing football for medical reasons. In three years at Michigan Pipkins had a torn knee ligament, a neck injury and multiple concussions.  Pipkins said he had been asked several times during a two-month period by Harbaugh and other staffers to retire from football. He also said he was told he could remain on scholarship and complete his degree."

CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,-35,Fri Jul 17 17:30:11 2015 UTC,You must have missed it. Jim Harbaugh thinks he's a MD and said he isn't healthy enough to play but real doctors tell him he's fine.
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,24,Fri Jul 17 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if serious? He's had 3 concussions, 2 torn ACLs and diagnosed worth arthritis in both knees."

CFB,3dn5uc,IVIacho_Grande,-25,Fri Jul 17 17:45:31 2015 UTC,If this was a Michigan only subreddit then troll applies. However this is a subreddit that covers all of college football and I just don't buy the narrative that Michigan fans are spinning because in their minds Harbaugh does no wrong. Take off your maize and blue glasses sometimes.
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,15,Fri Jul 17 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Opinions different than mine are fine with me. In fact I'd say they're encouraged because otherwise this place would be boring as hell.

CFB,3dn5uc,IVIacho_Grande,6,Fri Jul 17 18:37:46 2015 UTC,It's not an opinion though... Are you just not reading his list of injuries? Every doctor advised against him playing. You sound like you're saying UM is making up his injuries lol.
CFB,3dn5uc,OGSnowflake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"It does indeed say and other staffers in the article. I'd wager those other staffers include the sports medicine team. The head coach asked him because as the head, its his job to help players make those decisions. The player was offered a full scholarship to finish his degree. You're just trolling because you dislike harbaugh. I have no dog in this argument and couldnt care less about harbaugh."
CFB,3dn5uc,froschkonig,5,Fri Jul 17 19:42:26 2015 UTC,To be honest he (as well as most other football players) probably have had a lot more concussions than they have been diagnosed with.  Add the ACLs on top of that and yeah it seems like he should probably focus on his future and not football.
CFB,3dn5uc,bzhbuck,-25,Fri Jul 17 18:18:24 2015 UTC,But still medically cleared by a doctor.
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,13,Fri Jul 17 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"And so was Jamel Dean. Come on man, you're questioning the integrity of the Michigan medical staff which I can guarantee you are just as world class as our own internal medical team that didn't clear Dean.   Doctors have different opinions, and Harbaugh is believing the doctors closest to him and the program, there's nothing wrong with that."
CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,-23,Fri Jul 17 17:40:49 2015 UTC,Jamel Dean was not cleared by Ohio State doctors. He was cleared by Auburn's doctor and he's free to make the decision to play on his own.  You're misunderstanding it - Harbaugh actually disagrees with the doctor. He is questioning the integrity of his medical staff.
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,12,Fri Jul 17 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"""After consulting with our medical team, we do not think it is in Ondre's best interest as it relates to his health and welfare to play football, short or long term,"" Harbaugh said in a statement    The kid was approved for play by his personal knee surgeon, not the Michigan medical staff, just like Dean was approved for play by his surgeon, who also happens to be Auburns medical examiner."
CFB,3dn5uc,SurpriseSalami,-25,Fri Jul 17 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"Here is where the gray area is. As far as I understand, if team doctors felt he was physically unable to play football, there would be no question and he wouldn't be cleared to play. Team doctors make the evaluation independent of any influence of the coaching staff.  Harbaugh could be referring to his medical team as the team trainer who by the way is not a medical doctor."
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,5,Fri Jul 17 18:03:02 2015 UTC,That's not who he is referring to. You're really forcing it today

CFB,3dn5uc,YouCantSeeMe316,-19,Fri Jul 17 17:34:27 2015 UTC,I'm not trolling. I honestly feel for the kid. I was downvoted to oblivion by Michigan fans when the news initially hit for expressing my opinion and I'll take it again because I don't care. The doctors said the kid is medically cleared to play and the Pipkins is old enough to make decisions for himself. He committed to play for a school that he probably fell in love with and now the HC who isn't qualified tells him he's not medically ok to play.
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,4,Fri Jul 17 17:40:35 2015 UTC,It is ok to disagree with doctors.    Shane Morris.
CFB,3dn5uc,ekgsandemergencies,-12,Fri Jul 17 17:52:35 2015 UTC,It's ok to get a second opinion or third opinion for medical diagnosis and medical opinions from qualified people who have the designation of Medical Doctor.

CFB,3dn5uc,AL_DENTE_OR_NOTHING,-11,Fri Jul 17 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not making a reference to Shane Morris because that should have been caught but I'm willing to bet Pipkins isn't the only player on the team that has suffered multiple concussions. If the concussion thing is the big issue, then I expect Harbaugh to apply the same policy on all future players who have suffered multiple concussions."
CFB,3dn5uc,jay_mo,6,Fri Jul 17 18:21:35 2015 UTC,I'm sure you do. Such high moral integrity like always out of you
CFB,3dn5uc,OGSnowflake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"It's based on medical advice and not what Harbaugh says, though. Getting cleared from only one doctor doesn't mean enough when there's a conflict about it. Morris' one concussion is much smaller compared to all of Pipkins injuries and ailments.

E is the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian associated with energy, and Ψ is the wave function which H acts on.

CFB,3dmzi9,xrock24x,18,Sun Jul 19 00:08:32 2015 UTC,Bummer. Chicken being served at each game would be clutch. Plus the sauce is amazing.   … wait you mean Hurricanes?

If/when Miami ever becomes a national power again you can move from there, but for now it looks awful on the program to have the current stadium looking like a few DOZEN people are in attendance for most games."
CFB,3dmzi9,blackoutfish,6,Fri Jul 17 17:39:30 2015 UTC,Miami currently sells 52k+ tickets per game.    27k seats x $50 per seat x 6 games = $8.1 million.  We're not moving.
CFB,3dmzi9,WhoIsPurpleGoo,4,Fri Jul 17 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Selling that many tickets, why would the University be considering a stadium at 40k then, instead of something like 50-55k?  I really don't understand the recent trend towards smaller stadiums across the country from schools.  It's making me scratch my head a lot.  I'm sure it has to do with higher ticket prices, and fewer people coming to games with television guaranteed but it still feels wrong."
CFB,3dmzi9,ARayofLight,2,Fri Jul 17 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's more to do with fan experience. It's better to have a small, intimate environment that fans will want to go back to rather then having a 60k stadium with only 3k at it for games."

CFB,3dmzi9,KudzuKilla,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think for Miami to succeed in MLS they need to bring in some star power right off the bat.

Portland, Seattle, Columbus.   They have all thrives because the community took ownership of the team.  I don't know if the of miami will really care.

Loria, the owner, has been the source of most of the institutional hate by Miamians for essentially being the architect for the fleecing the city for money during the Marlins Park building/relocation and Florida-to-Miami rebrand.

The city builds a nice facility for a lower level team that allows them to  grow into a franchise that eventual gets into the first division of MLB and the Marlins are relegated. This would be prevent teams from holding cities hostage. The Rams want to leave for LA. Go ahead, the expansion St Louis Pilots get a reasonable stadium and a chance to build to the NFL first division. Oakland keeps the Raiders name for their second division expansion team."
CFB,3dmzi9,jayond,2,Fri Jul 17 21:29:16 2015 UTC,This would be fantastic. Relegation would really make some games and seasons interesting instead of just letting teams tank for draft picks.
CFB,3dmzi9,Fulmersbelly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"Always an interesting option but the problem is that the teams are franchises that are not intrinsically attached to the cities.

CFB,3doags,AlwaysChildish,2,Fri Jul 17 23:04:25 2015 UTC,It depends on what type of coaching change it is. If its because the previous guy was unsuccessful (see Tennessee or Notre Dame) the perception is usually guys not getting the job done but of the coaching change is a successful coach moving onto the NFL or retiring its a different situation and some coaches may be kept. You xal also have situations like Oregon where the head coach Brooks retired have all been promoted from within which begets continuity.
