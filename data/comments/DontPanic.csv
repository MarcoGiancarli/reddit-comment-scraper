DontPanic,3dy9o7,corpoal_cannabis,18,Tue Jul 21 05:49:26 2015 UTC,"I first read the books in German. Obviously, this joke doesn’t translate – I believe it was „du fragst nach einem Glas Wasser“ (“you ask for a glass of water”) or „du wünschst dir ein Glas Wasser“ (“you wish you had a glass of water”), something like that. (I don’t have the books with me right now to check.)  Much later, I listened to the audio book of HHGG, narrated by Stephen Fry (I especially love his Marvin). I already knew the text, and expected some version of “you ask for a glass of water”, so that’s what I heard. I didn’t catch that it was actually “go” instead of “you” and that there was no “for” in it.  A while later, I read that this was supposed to be a great pun, and got confused. Where was the pun in it? I didn’t get it, and that felt awful.  Then, a bit later, it hit me. I finally got it – AHH DRUNK AS IN BEING DRINKED – and I got so fucking angry. It’s such a stupid pun. I felt like ramming my head into something (I chose the bed instead of the wall, much healthier overall).  Glorious.  (Of course, the translation also added a few puns here and there, like „schon die Bäume waren ein Holzweg, man hätte nie die Meere verlassen sollen“. And it was a really good translation overall, it really captured the spirit – kudos to Benjamin Schwarz. So I can’t really complain.)"

Slartibartfast: What is your name, human? Arthur: Dent. Arthur Dent. Slartibartfast: Late as in the late Dentarthurdent. It's a sort of threat, you see. I've never been terribly good at them myself but I'm told they can be terribly effective.   Two meanings of “you will be late”. Throwing in “Dentarthurdent” as a misunderstanding on Slartibartfast’s side was an excellent distraction from that.

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.   and finally   One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem with changing the course of history—the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.  The major problem is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.  Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in fact in later aditions of the book all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term ""Future Perfect"" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be."

DontPanic,3cg2s9,blither,5,Tue Jul 7 19:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that one of the Adams biographies (Simpson or Webb) says that: (1) it was added to USA editions of the books, in order to stress that the books were all by the same person; (2) Adams didn't like it. I can't - quickly flicking through those books - find the relevant text, though. Perhaps some Adams-ista can give us a page reference.  As to Humma Kavula: well, perhaps that character could have amounted to something (and the name is Adamsian enough). In the film though, that character didn't really amount to much, i think - and I like to believe that that wasn't Adams's fault, even if Adams did invent or endorse the character."

The cutie was first illustrated by Peter Cross - a British illustrator. (who I am a great fan of, for his 'Trumpets' series of childrens books. It was a happy day for me when I discovered this link between two of my fandoms)  As noted, it was created by American publishers who wanted a consistent ""icon"" or logo to span the books which otherwise have unrelated titles.

For example:   Q: What led you to resist merchandising Calvin and Hobbes? – Nick Samoyedny, Tarrytown, NY  A: For starters, I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a Ford logo. . . . Actually, I wasn't against all merchandising when I started the strip, but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip, contradict its message, and take me away from the work I loved. If my syndicate had let it go at that, the decision would have taken maybe 30 seconds of my life.   And again:   The pressure on Watterson must have been enormous, but he steadfastly refused to sell out, even a little bit. ""I look at cartoons as an art, as a form of personal expression. That's why I don't hire assistants . . . and why I refuse to dilute or corrupt the strip's message with merchandising,"" he said in his Festival of Cartoon Art speech. ""Characters lose their believability as they start endorsing major companies and lend their faces to bedsheets and boxer shorts.""   If you're a fan of this way of thought, you might be interested in my subreddit /r/watterson, which is about the behind-the-scenes information about C&H, and Watterson's thoughts and opinions. I created it because I was frustrated with /r/calvinandhobbes being mostly reposts of the strip (two each day!) combined with a bunch of ""so I painted Hobbes on a mug"" or ""look at my snowman that looks like Calvin's snowman!"". The point is to inform beyond recreating or reminiscing. The subreddit is super low-volume (there are only 20 subscribers, and all submissions have been by me -- but feel free to submit if you find a good article).  Other than the two links, you might want to peruse the other submissions at /r/watterson, some of which investigate his thoughts on licensing."

DontPanic,3b46ur,You_Are_All_Diseased,5,Fri Jun 26 15:57:26 2015 UTC,I was so afraid to watch them at first. Friend loaned me a copy and it sat there for over half a year before I finally got up the courage. I realize how hard it is to make Douglas' writing style into a TV or movie. The biggest obstacle is that most of the humor is in the 3rd person narration.    But this I was okay with. It was a different Dirk Gently. I liked it enough that I was mad that they weren't going to be making any more. I bought my own copy on DVD and now I have the books and this.

The player acts the part of a human (whose house the starship crashed into) who goes aboard to help fix the ship, and must solve puzzles to collect the parts of the sabotaged onboard computer, Titania.
