FullmetalAlchemist,3e0pq8,itrytowriteright,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:45 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this is an alternate timeline where Al snapped after the Nina Incident?
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,dstoner79,5,Tue Jul 21 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"It felt very opposite to me, I found FMA03 to have a more childish story in the sense that I found it very simplistic at times. I felt there was less thought put into it (it would be hard to beat Arakawa at thought points put into her own work though lmao).  Strangely enough though, it's Brotherhood that seems to have the the most simple, basic, yet incredibly important lesson to finish the series with (and to me, it's also a very personal one, which plays a big role of why I heavily prefer Brotherhood).  It was the movie that really killed FMA03 for me actually, I disliked pretty much everything about it lmao (Except seeing Hughes wear a swastika, that was fucking hilarious). That's also why I decided not to watch Star of Milos, just in case it's as bad as Shamballa and would ruin the show for me lmao, I really don't want this show ruined for me. If Arakawa didn't have anything to do with it, then I don't want either, basically.  The genre also plays a big part, and the two are very different in this aspect. Brotherhood has everything I love; Adventure, exploration, friendship, character depth & development, sick animation, friendship, amazing comedy, detective work, and just generally a great pallet of complex characters, best I've seen. Also it has an extra dose of Greed, which I really dig.  So yah, don't mind if anyone prefers FMA03, but you asked and I answered, no hate."
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,prancerhood,3,Tue Jul 21 10:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, FMA 2003 works way better without Conqueror of Shamballa."
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,CloudMountainJuror,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:56 2015 UTC,You've just described exactly what I'm feeling about this two series. I cannot say better.  I also like that the Ishvalian campaign plays important role in Brotherhood; every soldier who participated in it has his\her own spiritual wounds linked with Ishval. IMO it plays important role in character development and looks very realistic.
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,chbkarin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"pretty much everything that happens in FMAB holds at least some importance & consequence, that's another reason why I love it a lot - that's also what I mean when I said/implied there's a damn lot thought put into it (:"
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,prancerhood,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yes. I was amazed when I read that Arakawa had made whole research before she started to create her manga: she had read about Medieval alchemy and history of Europe before WWI, she had interviewed people with physical disabilities, Ainu people (the non-Asian nation from Hokkaido which was practically exterminated by the Japanese), ex-members of yakuza and military veterans. It's very impressive work, and, as you've said, it's hard to beat her at this point."
FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,chbkarin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:16:38 2015 UTC,She's amazing and ridiculously hard-working.  Is there an English source anywhere where I could read more specifically on the kinds of research she did?

FullmetalAlchemist,3e14pl,Random_Dawn_14,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:13 2015 UTC,"FMA 2003. Brotherhood's great too, but I much prefer the mature thematic focus of FMA 2003 over the action-adventure focus of FMAB."

Either way, given the average demographics of the sub (American, male, aged 16-21), people probably watched it either on some US cartoon channel or Netflix, so dub was the first choice available. The age bracket also kinda explains why FMA:B is more popular."

FullmetalAlchemist,3dl3x9,Boogiepop_Homunculus,2,Fri Jul 17 05:19:07 2015 UTC,Why didn't he disable the attacking alchemists' powers during the Promised Day?
FullmetalAlchemist,3dl3x9,DoubleHunter,2,Fri Jul 17 09:31:37 2015 UTC,"He did. After absorbing 'God', he taps his finger on his chair and deactivates their alchemy.  Of course, Scar and May's alkahestry still works, as they read the 'Dragon Pulse', the Chi, of the world instead of the shifting of Tectonic plates, as Amestrian alchemists would.  The Ishvalan's seen around during Promised Day set up 5 nodes inside of the nationwide transmutation circle.  This reverse circle, for reasons I don't fully understand, causes the Amestrians to cease drawing energy from the Father's Philosopher's stone (as they have always done) and actually begin to harness the tectonic energy of the world.  After that reverse circle activates (moments after he disables their alchemy, IIRC), Amestrian alchemy returns.  There are no scene breaks between the Father's deactivation and the subsequent activation of the reverse transmutation circle, so the effect of this attack is only seen as May and Hohenheim are the only ones defending from the Father's onslaught in the moments between deactivation and reactivation"

FullmetalAlchemist,3dl3x9,JuicyFuckingMeme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"How did that not make his stone run out quickly? It seems like Hohenheim's stone ran out after a few alchemy tricks and blocking some of father's attacks, even though Hohenheim should have had the exact same amount of energy as father?"
FullmetalAlchemist,3dl3x9,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"Let's assume you can squeeze a lot of power out of a single soul, let alone 500,000. Also, Hohenheim spread a lot, if not most, of his souls around the country. The FMA Wikia says the Father has aged his body slightly more than Van Hohenheim because of his pipes."
FullmetalAlchemist,3dl3x9,IMightDoTheGaming,2,Sun Jul 19 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"His gigantic Philosopher's stone was circulating throughout Amestris through those pipes, and because this is what every Alchemist in Amestris drew their power from, he could just as easily shut it all down."
FullmetalAlchemist,3dkne2,4n70,5,Fri Jul 17 01:12:24 2015 UTC,No.  FMA 2003 has differences from the very beggining which impact the plot massively later on.  Even the Nina parts have differences that come back in the episode 40's. Also the first 25 episodes of FMA 2003 aren't as rushed as FMAB and are much better imo. Not to mention there are some 2003 exclusive characters that show up.
FullmetalAlchemist,3dkne2,alvinchimp,2,Fri Jul 17 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"FMA and FMA:B are both incredibly different, and although they share some plot points (and 2003 delays most of them) , they both deserve a start from the beginning."
FullmetalAlchemist,3dkne2,IMightDoTheGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:16:00 2015 UTC,I personally think it's better to start at the first episode.  It goes deeper into some parts and isn't as rushed as the first ten or so episodes of Brohood.

FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,alvinchimp,4,Thu Jul 16 18:53:57 2015 UTC,You gotta watch FMA Conqueror of Shamballa. Its the sequel to FMA 2003. Kissanime is a great site that I will recommend heavily.

FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,CloudMountainJuror,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, btw as for your Dante question. Gluttony apparently went crazy and ate her which results in him turning into a giant monster in the movie....."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Question 1: It's not a massive cliffhanger, though. It's a perfect representation of the stories' themes. Their journey never truly ends.  Question 2: The implication is that Dante and Gluttony killed each other.  I'm answering these questions without taking Conqueror of Shamballa into consideration, mind you, because really that movie is entirely unnecessary and just makes everything a mess."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,CloudMountainJuror,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:47:47 2015 UTC,"CoS is a direct sequel and the intended ending for the series. For example in CoS: Gluttony ate Dante and became mutated. He then meets his ending as does Wrath, tying up their storylines among others."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:39 2015 UTC,"And it's also unnecessary, as the original series wraps up its themes and characters fittingly without Shamballa. Did it provide all the closure in the world? No, but closure was there, and that ending and the overall execution of it fit the themes and presentation of the story. Not to mention Shamballa had some really shoddy storytelling, especially in comparison to the original series.  Shamballa is a nice extra to have, but it isn't needed, and people don't need to be directed to it to have their questions about the original series answered. This is a misconception that I wish wasn't as prevalent as it is, as it just makes things worse for the original series' reputation, sacrificing the compelling storytelling of the original ending for the rushed, unnecessary, forced plot closure of Shamballa's. As presented in the original series, it was implied Dante and Gluttony took each other out. That implication, that build-up with Dante weakened and preparing to fight Gluttony, and the following shot of the empty elevator is all that's needed, and is thematically consistent with the show. Shamballa took that implication and overwrote it, among other things.  I've gone many, many years not understanding the brilliance of FMA 2003. This is for various reasons, and Shamballa's common naming as the ""true"" ending of the series is one of them. Shamballa misses the point of the original ending, and in turn encourages its viewers to miss the point as well. If people want to watch it, OK, that's fine. But I wrote what I did, and will continue to do so in the future, because I don't want more people to end up like I did, underrating FMA 2003 because Shamballa mixed everything up. Because the series is having reputation problems as it is, and I desperately don't want to see it shoved any further under the rug by the anime community than it already is because of a false reliance on Shamballa as the ""real"" ending.  tl;dr OP has already had several answers saying they can watch Shamballa to get answers to their questions. I wanted to point out that while they can, they don't need to. That the lack of complete answers in the original ending is the point."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,CloudMountainJuror,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:28:57 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying and appreciate the cause in a certain way, but I disagree. I like CoS, but that isn't necessarily the point. I believe no one should skip any FMA. Many people are told to watch Brotherhood instead of 2003 and that's a shame. Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean that others should stay away. On principle CoS is necessary and should be watched because it exists. Same with 2003 for all you Brotherhood fans.  And specifically, I think there's a lot of good in the movie. For people like you and OP and everyone really, it's important to see that the bad guy was literally eaten by her own gluttony and it changed into a grotesque unrecognizable monster after her death. IMO, the whole series is about Ed growing up and making that decision to go to the other world should it mean that Al can live. After being dropped in the literal other world of adulthood, we see what that lesson means for Ed; he sees that it is nurture that makes good or bad men, that racial warfare and megalomaniacs are not simply the product of a single bad guy and her evil henchmen.  I could go on. But my final point will be that the movie let's Al make that transition to adulthood and the other world as well. They started as kids together and end up as adults together.  tl;dr CoS is a must watch because it is canon so the writer and director are telling you to and I think it's pretty awesome."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:37:13 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from on the ""watch everything FMA"" aspect. It's a nice thought, and fair. I'm not saying to not watch it. I'm saying that it's important to look at FMA 2003 as its own separate entity and understand how it functions as such, before looking into Shamballa. Understand what FMA 2003 was going for first (because it does thematically work entirely on its own, without Shamballa) instead of just jumping straight into Shamballa and potentially completely missing out on what FMA 2003 was going for.  It also seems like we don't see eye to eye on the quality of the film. I rewatched it recently to give it a fair shot after having finished rewatching FMA 2003 several times, and...it's really rushed, among other things. Not to mention it strips most of the subtlety away from the original ending. I used to love this movie to death when I was younger, but now that I have a better understanding of storytelling, it's lacking.  With Shamballa, the core thing you need to ask is: ""is this a better ending for the series than the original?"". And I can not in any way, shape, or form say that it is. There are genuinely good ideas in it, and I loved seeing some of those ideas explored. It had great animation, a solid opening act, a great dub, and was well-directed. The new setting to explore was interesting and had a lot of potential, some of which was lived up to. But none of this matters if it doesn't follow all the way through. And it doesn't. Characters were not fleshed out enough, and several things that happened felt super weird and had a lack of emotional payoff as a result. Not to mention some mechanics felt flimsy and really stretched believability. Al can attach bits of his soul to armor? What? Where did that come from? Yes, I know he used to be in a suit of armor, but from what alchemy has been presented to be before in the series, it's completely out of left field, and a horribly flimsy explanation. Also, where did the body inside the armor in which he reunited with Ed for the first time go? There was definitely a soldier inside it before, and the movie says that the soldiers sent inside the armor were crushed. There should be a corpse inside it. But nope, there's nothing, just so we can have this throwback of ""there's nothing inside the armor!"", even though it makes no sense. Also, Mustang was made out to be super miserable at the start of the movie, even though he was shown to be pretty happy and content at the end of the original series. There goes that emotional closure, completely obliterated. And for what? So he can show up again at the end of the movie for some reason, apparently ""back in the game""? Even though there was barely any build-up to this at all, so instead of feeling emotionally triumphant the moment just feels like an important scene or two got chopped out of the movie. Not to mention the actual climax of the movie is anti-climactic as hell. There's no tension. There's no actual imminent threat; there's no reason to fear those zombie soldiers. There's no actual feeling of danger. And the villain was developed so poorly that they don't even have a strong presence to back it up. Plus, the final confrontation with her is rushed to all hell. The movie tried to have a big, grand, epic ending, in contrast to the original ending's smaller-scale, more personal affair, and failed miserably."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,CloudMountainJuror,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:54:33 2015 UTC,"My first counterpoint will be that they cut a lot out of the script. IMO, that earns any movie and show some slack.   My second point will be a general one because I could sit here all day addressing every single one of yours. Yes, the movie's plot is weird and misshapen. But it doesn't matter. Because it doesn't really matter in the series either. Alchemy has always been a nebulous magic. Al is a Philosopher's Stone? Are all the souls bonded to the armor or just inside him? When they open up Al he literally glows like he's the briefcase from Pulp Fiction. Because that's all alchemy is, a plot device to tell a wonderful story.  Same goes for the antagonist and the conflict. I never look at Dante and think what a great villain she is or how I want to see her go down. She pops up at the end with minimal screen time and is merely functional. No development or strong presence that I can think of.  FMA and CoS tell such a good thematic, emotional story that I forgive/don't care about the actual plot, nor do they want me to care."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, Dante is an extraordinary villain and is developed ridiculously well. I heavily advise that next time you rewatch, you pay particular attention to how they develop Dante. She's one of the best villains I've ever seen. How she sees herself as a ""shepherd of sins"", as superior to humans who she only sees as brutal and flawed. How she manipulates the homunculi mentally to fit their named sins, and then continuously berates them in order to make them believe they're inferior to humans so they have a motivation to work for her. How she says when she's speaking to Hohenheim how when she was ""just an innocent"", he whispered words of love to her, implying that Hohenheim dragged her into this in the first place and in turn caused her mind to warp to this extent, caused her to develop this feeling of superiority over others. She's extremely well-developed, and if you haven't caught that before now, you're really missing out.  It does matter in the series, though. In the series they made it clear the souls were bonded to his soul, which was bonded to the armor. Very simple when you think about it. There are some plotholes in the series, yes, but they're minor and don't affect the overall plot in a major way. Unlike the movie, which again has way worse problems than just plotholes.  I also don't understand what you mean that FMA doesn't want you to care about the actual plot. That doesn't make a lot of sense. If you don't care about the plot, there's no reason to care about the themes it's presenting, because it's the plot which is presenting them in the first place. The plot develops the characters, the plot is a driving force in the storytelling.   Also, though it's a shame that they cut a lot of the script, it doesn't make the movie any better. The reality of the situation is that important material was probably cut, and isn't in the movie. What could have been in the movie doesn't affect the quality of the final product."
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,CloudMountainJuror,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"I guess we just have different definitions of things because I did not take notice of any of that nor do I care now. To me, an extraordinary villain would not first appear in the last 10% of movie or series. To me, she's an ordinary villain with a superiority complex and is mean to her henchmen.   But back to my original point, just because you don't like something doesn't mean you should crusade to spare other people your pain. It's what people always do to our beloved original series. It  costs nothing to watch a movie. Maybe people don't like it. Maybe it retroactively taints the series. But maybe it doesn't. So why not try?"
FullmetalAlchemist,3diwrb,Boogiepop_Homunculus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"She first appeared in episode 32, a little more than halfway through the series. Hardly in just the last 10%. If you didn't take notice of those details, then you're missing out on quite how good the show is. It's even better than you think. The devil's in the details, and Dante's development is brilliantly done through them.  Again, I'm not saying to not watch it. I'm saying to recognize what the original series accomplishes on its own before taking Shamballa into account, before watching it. Which is what can be said about both FMA anime. You need to appreciate what they accomplish on their own, by their own merits, before comparing them."
