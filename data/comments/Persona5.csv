Persona5,3dzal9,Roxoriku,10,Mon Jul 20 19:14:51 2015 UTC,I think the stealth mechanic is meant for getting player advantages or something like that. I hope their won't come a point where it's like you can't be spotted by enemies or you get thrown back to the start.
Persona5,3dzal9,Ibara3,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:57 2015 UTC,That and simply avoiding enemies at least early game. I doubt they would add a section where stealth is mandatory that would just be annoying.
Persona5,3dzal9,auragar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:04 2015 UTC,"Your probably right. But what if there is a leveling system for the stealth. The main reason I was wondering this is because the fact that it's supposed to be an important mechanic. Maybe since your a thief, there will be dungeons that aren't filled with shadows, but humans instead and avoiding detection will give you a hefty exp. bonus on completion or any kind of bonus for that matter. I feel like it will matter more than just a player advantage."
Persona5,3dzal9,auragar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't think there will be a leveling system for the stealth but a mechanic where being stealthy gives you bonuses could happen, even if only for specific dungeons I could see. As for whether or not I would like that, or think that would be a good idea I can't say, it not being forced/required makes it less of an issue, but still... doesn't seem too too fun all in all, but at the same time doesn't sound completely terrible, and does have some amount of intrigue to it imo."
Persona5,3dzal9,Stubev,4,Tue Jul 21 06:38:05 2015 UTC,"Looking at player advantages in Persona 4 golden on Risky, when you are going up against certain shadows and you aren't super buff, not having that 'stealth' player advantage at the start of combat can be a huge deal breaker. I imagine it'll just be a lot like that. When annoying enemies have god damn hama and mudo skills that will one shot you, having the stealth start is pretty friggen important."
Persona5,3dzal9,auragar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"If you do nothing but stealth yes you would end up with stats that aren't great (though I read that as you saying you think there will be a stealth stat? I don't think that will happen). The way I see it working is stealth is an optional thing you can do. In the very beginning you will likely be soloing the first dungeon (ignoring the casino which will be the first heist but I don't think we will get to really play it, it will be part of the intro more or less and probably just be a cutscene) and being stealthy will be more or less required, but as you get more members and especially once you get your team of four, with the MC, Anne, Ryuji, and Morgana you will be able to just go all out and finally tackle the entire dungeon. Though I am sure strategies and tactics will be made amongst fans that make that unnecessary but yah, at first when the game is just first releasing that is more than likely how it will be, and will be the way it is ""meant"" to be played, or rather how the developers intended it to be played (similar to how you can beat a person's dungeon FAR before you are meant to in Persona 4, usually used in 100% runs and such)."
Persona5,3du7q9,CHRIISHAUDREY,8,Sun Jul 19 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"There was a post on this in /r/megaten before, but I can't for the life of me find it. Here's the screenshot they speculated on though. As you can see in the picture, there's the evoker from Persona 3 (right) the summoning from Persona 4 (middle) and the speculated ""ripping off mask to summon"" (left). Sorry if it wasn't much help, but this is from memory of that post."
Persona5,3du7q9,Cloud2097,5,Sun Jul 19 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer thank you. I'm completely on board with mask ripping to summon persona. That's so fantastic. Really symbolizing the unleashing of ""true self"". Thanks!"
Persona5,3du7q9,auragar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"If anything, that is them pushing the mask to their face or touching the mask. Not ripping. If you watch the second trailer it seems obvious that ripping the masks is not used for summoning but rather to separate the persona from the person."
Persona5,3du7q9,ReiXgh,2,Tue Jul 21 07:40:08 2015 UTC,masks is my theory
Persona5,3du7q9,auragar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"We don't really know, but it will be related to masks/chains. I don't think it will involve ripping them off, and I think in fact that the scene with the MC ripping off his mask with the flood of blood spurting out of his face is him trying to separate himself from his persona which was slowly taking control over him due to it being somewhat sentient (which we speculate that they are because we assume (due to the lines he says)  the voice speaking is his persona during PV#02)."
Persona5,3du7q9,kazoodles,3,Tue Jul 21 07:27:44 2015 UTC,This isn't even anything to speculate on. Watch trailer #2 and you'll see them ripping off their masks to summon personas.
Persona5,3du7q9,SemiZeroGravity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:59 2015 UTC,Tbh I don't think that's him summoning his persona I think it's him awakening his persona
Persona5,3du7q9,kazoodles,0,Sun Jul 19 23:12:48 2015 UTC,in trailer #2 he rips his mask off in battle to summon his persona.
Persona5,3du7q9,SemiZeroGravity,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:58 2015 UTC,"Nope look closely he does not remove it, just watched the trailer he just touches it and it glows"
Persona5,3du7q9,kazoodles,0,Sun Jul 19 23:57:22 2015 UTC,Are we talking about the same trailer?
Persona5,3du7q9,SemiZeroGravity,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:50 2015 UTC,The pv#2 right? The one that came with p4dan that's what I am referring to and I am also referring to the gameplay not the cutscene with blood coming out of his face
Persona5,3du7q9,kazoodles,0,Mon Jul 20 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's what i'm referring to to. he definitely summons his persona with his mask"
Persona5,3du7q9,SemiZeroGravity,4,Mon Jul 20 01:17:48 2015 UTC,He uses his mask but does not remove it
Persona5,3du7q9,N0Tanks,3,Mon Jul 20 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yea Semi is right, he touches the mask but he doesn't take it off"
Persona5,3du7q9,Lavendou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:15 2015 UTC,"It's about a minute and 18 seconds in, but in the second trailer you can see the summoning animation itself, and he doesn't appear to be putting anything physical on or taking anything off, but rather covering their face with their hand like in the screenshot posted earlier. What's interesting is that he gets that distinctive blue persona summon energy emanating from his hand and face while covering the face before releasing the persona, so I think that it could be like a blue ""energy mask"" for lack of a better term that they use to summon them. I guess time will tell though."
Persona5,3dqgpl,smtsj,6,Sat Jul 18 13:33:00 2015 UTC,Seems as close to her as Rise or any pigtailed hair girls in the series...
Persona5,3dqgpl,LX_Theo,0,Sat Jul 18 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"They both use whips, and both have green eyes, IIRC Yuka was confirmed to have gotten married by P2, and by now she'd be about 36. She was also a typical kogal (basically think kind of like Gyaru but a bit, uh. Well. To sum it up the bandage on her neck is to hide a hickey. She's also fashionable af, and would've probably given her kid a western name.) They've definitely got more similarities than Rise, though. Actually, Rise, Anzu and Yuka are the only pigtailed girls in Persona. (Okay I know Kanami had them in the past but she  got rid of them so she doesn't really count.)  I'm just saving this in case I get a chance to yell ""I TOLD YOU SO!"""
Persona5,3dqgpl,LX_Theo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"lol, what?  One, their eye colors are not nearly the same. Call them green on Yuka or not, I'd easily see someone mistaking it as brown. Where for Anne/Anzu, its clearly green.  Two, hair color is very different. Same range of shades means little.  Three, the hair style similarity for ancestry argument is silly for obvious reasons.  Four, are you really calling the fact that they wear long tops over their uniform? If you look up kogal, you notice that none of the other aspects are there except that anyways.  Five, the rest of your argument is that its possible for her to have a kid at this age at that time... But that means basically nothing otherwise.   Just going to leave it at that... Because its just silly to a facepalm extent."
Persona5,3dqgpl,LX_Theo,0,Sat Jul 18 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yuka's eyes are usually drawn brown, but occasionally they're green. (I believe it was a mistake in some of the art, so I apologize for that.) I was focusing more on the hairstyle, but also consider the fact that Ayase was drawn by Kaneko, and during that period he used that method of shading. Or it could show it was dyed. I only pointed out the hairstyle similarity because the only other twintails-chan we've had is Rise. And no I'm not talking about them wearing long tops. Anzu seems like the typical fashionista and also foreign, and Ayase's bio calls her a kogal.   I wasn't saying it was definite, but like Metatron-X pointed out, it could just be a nod.   If you don't wanna agree, that's fine. But I just feel like something's up.  Eh, whatever."
Persona5,3dqgpl,LX_Theo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well, from an outsider's perspective... Your logic and evidence doesn't strike me as much more credible than a conspiracy theorist. The similarities are just so paper thin and basic that its a bit off-putting to see someone come to that conclusion.  There's a difference between disagreeing and something coming off as grasping at straws to come to a potential conclusion."
Persona5,3dqgpl,KuroNekogami,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"You do know I wasn't actually saying this is canon/confirmed, right?  If not, then I'm sorry if we came to a misunderstanding. But at this point, grasping at straws is all we can really do, since Atlus's decided to withhold information from us. There's a whole fucking rainbow of possibilities, but I just thought this was worth pointing out.  Sorry if we got off on the wrong foot."
Persona5,3dqgpl,KuroNekogami,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"Of course you're not.  That doesn't make it sound any less silly. The problem I have is that your concept here just sounds ridiculous even for pure speculation. Nothing more, nothing less."

Persona5,3dhwtn,LitJackson,3,Thu Jul 16 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"My first thought when I heard it was exactly that. Still have no idea what direction the vocals will go this time around, if any. They'll probably make or break the song IMO."
Persona5,3dhwtn,ThatGuyfromNI,2,Fri Jul 17 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think so too. It just sounds like fighting music. It could be a boss theme I suppose. But my money's on the main battle theme, and the only reason it sounds weaker is because that's the instrumental version."
Persona5,3dhwtn,PeteOverdrive,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really sound like a battle theme to me. More like the OP theme, or the ""normal days"" theme, or maybe a dungeon theme?  I really hope it isn't the battle theme, though. It just doesn't feel right."

Persona5,3ddjjr,FlamingoChunguita,6,Wed Jul 15 12:47:30 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that Persona 2 is two games, Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment, which are direct sequels that share a setting.    P3 has two remakes, FES (which is an enhanced version of the PS2 original with some bonus story content) and Portable (which is a PSP version that is a visual downgrade, but adds some new content and the option to play as a female main character.    This is only for the versions available in English in North America.   PS1: P1, P2:EP |  PS2: P3, P3 FES, P4 |  PS3: P3 FES, P4, P5 (later this year, supposedly) |  PS4: P5 (later this year, supposedly) |  PSP: P1 remake, P2:IS remake, P2:EP PS1 version, P3 Portable |  PSV: P1 remake, P2:IS remake, P2:EP PS1 version, P3 Portable, P4 Golden"
Persona5,3ddjjr,Monsoon_Mike,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming P3 FES story-wise is my best option, then. And is the PSP version of P1, P2:IS and P2:EP better than the ps1 version in terms of graphics, or are they just ported for the PSP users?  Thanks for the comment, by the way!"
Persona5,3ddjjr,G-1BD,2,Wed Jul 15 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Answer part of FES is a real pain unless you've got a very good grasp on the combat system. Other than the model animations, if you're willing to find the animated parts of P3 separately, then you're not missing out on much other than some system changes as far as male MC P3P (you gain control, but the fusion spells now involve consumables).  You of course gain the entire female MC.  P1 got almost all of the changes from when it was released as Revelations: Persona back. The only one that mattered is still there. Unfortunately even with the much better translation (i.e. the Physics type magic isn't going to be confused with Physical) it's still a very rough game.  The re-release of Innocent Sin is the PSP updated version which has different music, an actual English translation, videos, and all that stuff added in.  Eternal Punishment, for most of the world, is only available as the Playstation release, just made to work on PSP, Vita, and PS3 (and 4, I guess). There was a version like the IS release made for the PSP, but it never got brought out of Japan.  My guess involves Index's financial woes of the times."

But from that perspective, P2 EP was a step backward in graphics, but not in mechanics or gameplay, which I found entertaining and challenging. The core concepts of the MegaTen family, magic via supernatural allies, merging magic/allies, and Tarot cards, are implemented differently, but still very effectively.  I liked P2 EP quite a lot. The OP should at least try it."
Persona5,3daxy1,smtsj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"2's story not that great   You couldn't be more wrong. Even on it's own, IS's story is actually really good. It may have some anime cliches, but in the game's a lot of it's concepts were almost unheard of. It's much better than 3 and 4's, if you ask me. Persona 1's story was also pretty good if you ask me. They both went a lot further than P3 and 4, which IMO were quite limited. Also, P2 has this wonderful line of dialogue (IS spoilers).  Putting it simply, the Persona games are accurate of their times. They were good when they came out, but it's really up to you if you feel they aged well. P1 and 2 are more traditional RPGs, and have more stable and solid battle systems than P3 and 4's. Plus they came out in the 90s in Japan, so the plots are a lot more creative due to them being able to basically put whatever the fuck they want in thanks to the creation of moe not yet existing, so no definition of what ""sells"". Each of the Persona games are good in their own right, but story wise? Older ones all the way. The battle system may unnerve you, but stick with it. It's the same as any SMT game, just more options. Though in P1's case you might want a guide."
Persona5,3daxy1,Monochan,3,Sat Jul 18 09:23:12 2015 UTC,"Persona 1 and 2 are both released on the PS1 and then released on the PSP, so you would not be able to play them in the first place unless your PS2 has backwards compatibility.

In P2 Nyarly had to fuck everything up and add rumors coming true.  P3 had the DH and P4 the Midnight Channel, most likely limited summoning because Nyarly isn't around to fuck things up so there's no point going overboard or P3+4 party members are complete and utter weakasses."

(apart from all this true ending Shit)  The game doesn't even acknowledge any of your choices.  Chie is your girlfriend! But your friends, the game and Chie, act like nothing happened.  Persona 3 FES and Portable had at least two events where your choices affected the main story and major characters.  But P4 seemed to repeat everything.  In P5 my choices (e.g  girlfriend)  should have an impact on the main story and should be acknowledged.  Another thing, I hope the story doesn't turn into ""Mankind wishes for its own demise"""

Persona5,3d1ip1,Ibara3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:33:18 2015 UTC,I still need to play that game :/
Persona5,3d1ip1,Apostol_Matariel,5,Fri Jul 17 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"I want:  Demon conversations to return.  Bara party member.  Aqua/Magna/Nuclear/Blast/Gravity lines back.  Arcana affinities back, no more of this ""only the protag can use multiple personas bcus u must feel like ur special even among fictional ppl!!!1!""  If I can't have bara party member let me tap Ryuji.  A longer time span. P4 didn't even give us a full year. Maybe 2 or 3 years? That'd be cool.  No more needing a persona of the same arcana of a social link to have any hope of finishing them all by the deadline.  Fusion spells to return.  More dialogue options, IE I don't want to be locked into having to act like an asshole like during the Camping scene in P4.  More dungeons that actually have some thought and design put into them and aren't the exact same thing through and through.  No one as fool arcana."
Persona5,3d1ip1,ThatBlueHatGuy,2,Sun Jul 12 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm i'd say a year to maybe a year and a half would be good but then again it depends.  As much as i like other characters having the ability to use multiple personas i don't know how i would feel about it now. I'd say if anything let the other characters be able to use maybe 2 to 3 personas but i feel this time around the persona might be special due to this whole ""Steal back your future"" and him being locked up while seeing igor :3  Yeah having a persona of the same type just to boost the story and try to finish it was annoying af."
Persona5,3d1ip1,_thatspoonybard,2,Sun Jul 12 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"I was looking at it more like P1/2 where you had affinities with different Arcana, so some characters had a Best affinity which meant low SP cost, some had Good which was a low SP cost but not as low as Best, normal was the normal SP cost, Bad was a High SP Cost, and Worst meant you couldn't equip the Persona at all. I just don't want to be treated like I'm oh so special.   Plus if the MC is a normal person like all the other Party Members, we won't have to deal with his death being a fucking instant game over.   They really need to make SL more bearable if they're gonna keep them in. The problem I had was that Character Development was locked exclusively in SLs, which sucked major ass."
Persona5,3d1ip1,iflewthat,3,Sun Jul 12 20:21:49 2015 UTC,Okay now i see what you mean yeah it does suck when the MC gets rekt and its automatic game over yet all the other party members are alive.   Since now the game is based around society i would like to see some things that maybe everyone can connect to like trying to maybe fit in at school or something like that. Maybe social links would be bearable if they have good stories for characters you try to bond with.
Persona5,3d1ip1,Nevr0s,2,Sun Jul 12 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"SLs would have to be longer than in the earlier games. Plus, I'd rather they just add a function where a link goes down if you ignore them instead of this point system crap. Would be kinda annoying, but less time management thought required.  Due to the Japanese perception of the ""proper"" family and how homosexuality is generally seen as a fetish/not talked about publicly often, I can bet you there'll probably be a gay character because they'd fit right in with the theme.   Another feature I'd like is a music player/jukebox function where I can change what music plays in different areas/battle, like in the Atelier remakes so I don't have to listen to Engrish JPop for the whole game (pls give me PS1 Persona ost)"
Persona5,3d1ip1,_thatspoonybard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:32:13 2015 UTC,I just hope they give us what we want regardless they are gonna do a good job on the game just hopefully some the features are godlike and not annoying to deal with.  Me too i would like to see the music player return when in a dungeon
Persona5,3d1ip1,smtsj,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"What we don't need: A repeat of the Fox SL. Seriously, fuck those quests.  Kinda hoping we can get alternate outfits again, because I'm not too big a fan of the burglar costumes. (All I want is my all male swimsuit/fundoshi team again pls Atlus)"
Persona5,3d1ip1,MrAwesome9020,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:24 2015 UTC,Outfits would be neat to throw in as well
Persona5,3d1ip1,smtsj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:43:23 2015 UTC,Outfits are most likely going to be returning because it was an awesome thing in golden to have the look you want with the stats you wanted. I don't see why they would remove a feature that people liked.
Persona5,3d1ip1,IFuckingBlow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there will be alternative outfits, but one thing that always makes a white-glove thief a white-glove thief is his/her outfit: Catwoman, Arsène Lupin, Fantômas; they're always so very recognizable for their out of norm outfits, always ready to steal and run."

It would be so awesome if the other characters would acknowledge your love interest throughout the game. Otherwise, it's weird and disjointed no?   I'm sure it'll be a phenomenal game regardless. I mean it's Atlus we're talking about here. I won't throw a tantrum if my dreams don't come true. They might even surprise us for all we know. It has been a while since they've made a brand new Persona game.   PS. Persona Q does not count."
Persona5,3d1ip1,sleepepe,4,Mon Jul 13 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have no gripe against the current protagonist, but I'd also love to play as  female more in the Persona series as well. I enjoyed playing as FeMC in P3P and it gave the game higher replayability and I had more incentive to play it more. To my shame, I still haven't played P2:EP as Maya lol. I'm still hyped af though. P5 protag seems really cool."
Persona5,3d1ip1,smtsj,2,Tue Jul 14 02:23:38 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to bet that the ability to play as a female will be either DLC or an added feature in a FES or Golden version equivalent

Persona5,3cy3yv,KronusX7,11,Sat Jul 11 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"I think its because reddit looks at your internet history and if theres a subreddit that matches it, then they put an ad there for you."

Persona5,3crtnw,thegreathobbyist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:40 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Though apparently it's common for them to do it to prevent importing the games cheaper.
Persona5,3crtnw,earisu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:36:55 2015 UTC,P4A was also region locked because it came out in Japan first and they didn't want importers(AKA those with deeper pockets) to get an unfair advantage

If this one ends up being your favorite, using it as a baseline or standard for the successive games and could bring for an interesting look. Even after p5 comes out the need for the sub will drop. I feel that's harsh to say, but at the moment this is mostly just a place to find a collection of news for the game up to release. We could make a persona general sub and keep it alive. The megaten one is cool, but the memes get rather dank at times and conversation is usually riddled with circlejerks."

THe answer to your question. This place will likely die off (how quickly who knows) and everyone will migrate to the inevitable /r/persona6 sub.

Some odd ball ideas:  If you guys do create a new subreddit maybe we can have some theme changer (I think that's what it's called) something that /r/roosterteeth and /r/fatestaynight has where you can switch the CSS of the subreddit to a Persona 3/4/5 theme.

Also every party member can switch out masks.  Reasons:  1) In the reveal trailers for Persona for P3 & P4 you had every party member shown in someway shae or form, in the one for P5 we only see the 3 main human charectors, the Cat and maybe another figure breifly.    2) In the first trailer when they all out attack the face cut outs show them without any masks on.  http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/P5-2.gif  3) The blue flames form over the protaganist like a mask, then form an outfit http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150207122427/megamitensei/images/1/1d/Persona_5_21_by_hachiubi-d8gt40b.jpg  So what does this mean?   With a small pool of party members, being able to alter them and keep upgrading them into a playstyle you like is essential. Maybe a system similar to Persona Q's, where the Protagonist and Arsene are the only one's who can ""Steal"" shadows/persona/demons and make them equipable for the team. Each new sub persona would give each character access to new skills, stats and roles within the group; allowing them to break free from their pre-designated roles in the group, if you will."

Persona5,3bthel,bananaheadlurker,12,Thu Jul 2 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"The shape of the Velvet Room represents the nature of the ""journey"" that the Wild Card is facing throughout the game. In Persona 3, the room was an ascending elevator that represented both the physical process of climbing Tartarus as well as the MC's ""ascension"" to his role. In Persona 4, the room was a limousine moving through fog, which represented the mystery the MC had to solve as well as representing the actual fog that plays a role in the events. In both of these, there is a sense of constant movement, and Igor and the attendants are also depicted in a servile role, as elevator attendants and chauffeurs respectively.  This new Velvet Room is different - we haven't seen too much of it, but the idea of a ""prison"" doesn't naturally lend to the constant movement that was a theme in previous incarnations, and Igor and the twins don't appear in a servile role. However, despite this, I do think that the prison setting actually does somewhat fit with the themes of the past two games.  First of all, the theme of ""movement"" in past games, while visually evocative, is mostly a representation of the passage of time - and prison is a setting that is strongly tied to ""time"" as well. As for the role of the inhabitants, things begin to make more sense if you think of them as ""facilitators"" of the Room itself rather than being specifically there to ""help"" the MC. In the elevator and the limo, they take the role of servants because that is what is necessary for the Room to function in those forms. If the Room is a prison, it needs guards and a warden. It's also possible that Igor acts as a ""parole officer"" of sorts for the MC, or some similar role that is ostensibly there to ""help"" the inmates serve out their sentences.  For me, the main question is the nature of the MC's incarceration. Normally, when imprisoned, the simplest way to deal with the situation is just to behave and wait out the sentence, but the Velvet Room's role has always been to facilitate action rather than inaction. At the same time, an out-and-out prison break being the goal would not make sense either, because the attendants wouldn't help him, and furthermore the MC's ""imprisonment"" in the Room is not the actual problem in and of itself, it's merely representative of the problem. (In a similar manner, the P3MC couldn't just have gotten to the top of Tartarus just by waiting in the Velvet Room elevator and getting off at the top floor.)"
Persona5,3bthel,fullplatejacket,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:01:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment! I think I also noticed that on another level that the velvet room relates to the dungeon closely (for the same reasons it ties into the plot) with the exception of P1 and P2 (for obvious reasons). But since the dungeons here seem to be tied into the real world (maybe? that was just some theory thrown around before but it seems to be the case?)  how do you think this will work?
Persona5,3bthel,PeteOverdrive,4,Sat Jul 4 04:31:57 2015 UTC,"P3 was about the journey of life and the destination of death, thus the elevator.  P4 was about searching for the truth in the haze of a mystery, thus the limo.  P5 is said to be about being freed from the restraints that hold us back in life. A prison seems especially fitting this time."
Persona5,3bthel,ChronoBaron,3,Fri Jul 3 13:46:32 2015 UTC,I kinda want his room the be an interrogation room. It would make sense plot wise and structure-wise would work.
Persona5,3bthel,Thrashinuva,2,Fri Jul 3 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any rules to the velvet room. The room is shaped around the guest for it. In this case, the MC's future has been stolen. I made a guess at what this means in the plot theory thread but basically I think his imprisonment in the velvet room is more than symbolic, and is actually rather representative of his current situation."

Persona5,3bo9l2,cadgers,6,Tue Jun 30 20:56:19 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Catherine style. The faces emote enough to not need the portraits. Other than that the little cut outs you can see in PV1 are probably going to be the full extent of drawn portraits in the game.
Persona5,3bo9l2,thegreathobbyist,3,Wed Jul 1 00:58:34 2015 UTC,"They're fine close up, but the PV makes it seem like most of the conversations are going to be from a wider perspective where the faces aren't even clearly visible. For example, there's a bit in PV1 set in the cafe in which the group is looking over a map/blueprints laid out on a table (Pause at 1:18). I imagine that will be a common setting similar to how the Investigation Team would talk while sitting at the Junes food court in P4. I don't think it's really possible to get a good sense of the characters' emotions from that look - in the video, you can only get a sense of Ryuuji's expression out of all four, and even with him you can only see half of his face."
Persona5,3bo9l2,fullplatejacket,5,Wed Jul 1 07:46:20 2015 UTC,"I think the typical scenes will still have something similar to that. There will probably be a lot more cinematic scenes like Catherine had, though. Probably most things involving the main plot, at least."

So even if they aren't using static portraits like P3 and P4, I feel like they would need something else to use to express emotion in the wide shots that probably will make up most of the regular scenes."

It sounds like your motivation is to get revenge/justice for whoever is responsible for that. I believe ""stolen fate"" refers to the general opportunities the protag's former life would have provided.  As for the painter, it's worth noting he doesn't actually write the words. The words show up, then it cuts to him painting in a similar font, and when it cuts to everything he's written, it's just ""Never give in"" repeatedly. This could just be the result of them cutting up his section of the intro so the trailer flows better, but I think it's worth mentioning.  The director has said the restraints and chains refer to circumstances in life which hold us back from our desires in life, but I also think you're right in thinking the player needing to take responsibility for his actions will be a major story arc."
Persona5,3bl08q,PeteOverdrive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:42:20 2015 UTC,"Great post but i'd add that  The game starts with something terrible happening to either just the main character or the other 3 which is probably what we saw in the very first trailer as time stopped and the main character was the only one seeing things also in the first gameplay trailer when we are shown the same crosswalk and someone (probably the main character) in a coat falling to the ground which awakens Arsene   Which is also shown in the first trailer with the blue flames in the reflection of his glasses what i would think is that the main character at that point is taken over by Arsene or something like that as Demons or Personas seem to be taking over people with masks (seen in the most recent trailer)  As for the Blue haired guy painting all i can say about him is he definitely goes to another school with his white School clothes and the Fluer-De-Lis symbol on his chest. I sort of doubt he would be a party member as why would he be writing things such as ""Are they on the path to glory or ruin if he is one of their friends.  I think if anything he might be an information giver who tells gives them maps or other such information about where to find what they want to steal. Or he could be someone like Pharos.  The theme is definitely rebellion if anything the main color Red proves its about something along those lines also it's been stated by the creators that you are fighting back against society and that you're trying to stand out because most people nowadays are held back by things like being unpopular and such so people feel like prisoners in the society they live in not wanting to do what they want which is probably the future the main characters want."
Persona5,3bl08q,Juriga,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go out on some limbs here.  ""Let us begin""  ""Steal back your future""  I'm going to take your idea of Arsene being more vocal than ever and expand on it. Arsene Lupin I'd supposed to be the greatest theif that ever lived according to his mythology. He even outwits the great Sherlock Holmes.  First off, Persona 3 and 4 spoilers below.  First let's take a look at the last two Persona games. In Persona 3, the MC houses two Personas. That would be Orpheus and Thanatos. Orpheus was his own Persona, and Thanatos was another entirely different Persona that not only could he not control, but wasn't even his own.  Then we have Persona 4. MC only has his one Persona, but it has its own alter ego within the plot, though it isn't expanded on. Worth noting is that the main character had the main villain have the same voice actor, which is completely intentional.  End Persona 3 and 4 spoilers.  So my guess amounts to this. Arsene Lupin, the Persona, has his own agenda within the plot. Whether it's MC's own ego at fault or something else entirely, Arsene will have been responsible for unleashing MC's reckless side, in an attempt or as a result of stealing away control from MC. ""Steal back your future"" will be a request or guideline Igor will state for the MC, telling him that he must seize back total control. It is not Igor who has set him behind bars, but in fact Arsene who has locked him away. Arsene might very well be the final villain of the game, or at least a major obstacle to overcome. Defeating him might be the end of nights on the prowl to steal priceless artifacts or whatever."

I doubt that is what that means, though it could mean multiple endings. I see it more as it just being part of the theme of the characters being roguish.  Not a party member but certainly important, though also not the guide. Igor will always be the true guide. The reason he is painting it is to give some significance to his character. He will likely be very important, but we cannot fathom how yet.  It really just means once you have completed the game we will further talk about your journey. It could also mean that we won't really be going to the Velvet Room much besides the opening part. You might think then what about fusing and stuff. Honestly I kind of don't think it will be in this game. You are more or less stuck with Arsene  except perhaps its evolution.  I think it again more or less really just ties into the theme. Steal their future from society trying to hold them down. I certainly don't see the antagonist as doing that as that makes no sense whatsoever. And you will not fight Igor. Igor would just destroy you anyways if you did."

Persona5,3bflvy,renegademessiah,3,Mon Jun 29 00:30:30 2015 UTC,It would be nice if we could have a sort f skill card system where you fuse a persona around the same level as Arsene and Arsene and get an upgraded version of Arsene with stats boosted from the other persona (like EV Training in Pokemon) and a random skill if lucky.

Persona5,3bflvy,Xorn101,3,Mon Jun 29 03:16:54 2015 UTC,There was a scene that looked like he was ripping off a mask from a shadow. Keep in mind it seems Persona summoning seems to be based around using masks anyways.  I suspect that the stolen masks will be used as the multiple Persona aspects. Potentially forcefully and without the need for the Fool
Persona5,3bflvy,LX_Theo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's so much of the ""protag power level"" seeming to revolve around being a wildcard persona user that it's hard to imagine not having the ability to hit the velvet room and fuse.  If I had my way I'd dream of things like other personas being ""masks"" or disguises for Arsene, or a different character (too young?  too... something?) being the wildcard but playing second fiddle for some reason."
Persona5,3bflvy,Marwgofuckyourself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"As part of their plan to make the Persona games more approachable to the masses and newcomers, I think they'll limit the amount of personas the protagonist can have and throw the whole fusion thing out the window. Every major story event will have Arsene go through something like metamorphosis with different results according to what events you choose to tackle first. That's just my opinion."
Persona5,3bflvy,auragar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"Their main weapons are their melee weapons. The MC uses daggers. Ryuji uses blunt weapons. Anne uses whips. Morgana uses swords. They just also happen to have secondary weapons which are firearms or ranged weapons. MC with a pistol. Ryuji with a shotgun. Anne with a machine gun. Morgana with a slingshot. As for personas I do believe that the MC this time around can only use Arsene (and possibly its evolved form if it exists). Just like every other character. This is because of the strong ties the personas seem to have to the main characters. Enemies just get generic persona but eh. And it is less about ""The Fool"" and more about being the wildcard. I don't think he will be the wildcard this time around. I kind of doubt there will be any wildcards this time around. I kind of like that, but I can understand why others might not like that as much. We also notice the MC listed as Joker at one point while shopping, so who knows what that means."

Persona5,3bgfya,Juriga,3,Mon Jun 29 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"I´d just like to mention that the casino doesn´t seem to be the first location you go to. In the trailer you can clearly see the MC fighting Norn, a rather high level persona. Plus his HP and SP are quite higher there than in other scenes like when they make the all-out attack in the previous trailer. That casino seems more like a mid-to-high level dungeon.   The castle-like place with the spider chandeliers and the knight-like shadows seems like the first location and is also shown to be a place where you go alone. My farfetched guess is that there may be certain incentives (story wise maybe) to going through a dungeon alone."
Persona5,3bgfya,smiauf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:40:22 2015 UTC,Actually i didn't even notice the hp being more and i guess a reason why the castle looking place could be the first would be that the part where Arsene takes over his body or whatever looks exactly like that area and has knights (which might be in more areas but who knows) also a big reason i still think the castle is a possible first area is because of the cutscene it would be a good way to start the game by that i  mean like when narukami first enters the TV but here Arsene takes over maybe and uses MC's body to go to the casino maybe the HP is just a starting thing like he has 400 hp and in the other one they all have about 100 something hp so when you're alone which yeah might be a feature later on in the game the Hp combines so you have more of a chance at survival
Persona5,3bgfya,auragar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"That scene is probably not related to his awakening. I think it is him trying to break away from his persona who is sentient and trying to take over his conscious. It won't be a one time battle to control it but something he has to fight through the whole game. By the end perhaps he will contain it or maybe that is why it will evolve if it will. Another reason I don't see it being his awakening is this seems to take place somewhere with a cobble brick background while his awakening takes place in the center of Shibuya crossing while time freezes.  I don't know about starting there, but the casino is definitely VERY early on in the game. I don't think it is necessarily limited to night but yah Arsene definitely wants to take control of the MC. Ryuji being in pain is definitely because of his persona. The masks being torn of the others is because their persona took over because they aren't the main characters and therefore suck. The main characters are always more powerful than the random npcs or enemies. The theory about the MC being behind bars to keep him from Arsene is actually an amazing theory and it does make sense. I could see it happening."
Persona5,3bgfya,cavecricket49,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:07 2015 UTC,"unlike Narukami who just has his persona without facing his shadow self   The thing about Yu Narukami- and also Minato- is that  they acquired their Personae directly from the source- that is, Yu received Izanagi through direct contact with Izanami, and Minato from the Death arcana that was directly sealed within him. Now, as to how the MC here is going to get his Persona, that's anyone's guess; it might be a case reminiscent of Digital Devil Saga, where all the tribes of the Junkyard are just there at the wrong time when Sera arrives, or there's a contact with a deity/some other event that occurs but we haven't quite seen yet."
Persona5,3ba62i,DMthePerson,5,Sat Jun 27 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"For a long time the series has used a Persona as an analog of the true self, with the analogy of a mask to face harsh realities. In P5 it looks like it is literally a mask. What's interesting about P5 is they have to remove the mask to summon their Persona, and it looks like an excessively painful process. It could imply that these characters are not entirely upfront with who they are. I don't know, that's maybe reading too much into trailers and interviews."
Persona5,3ba62i,Jamvaan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:33:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, most of the time a Persona is the opposite of the true self - ""a facade.""    The persona, for Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, was the social face the individual presented to the world—""a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual [the shadow].""    A Persona allows us to face reality by filtering the stream of consciousness that is our true selves (shadow) according to what our current social environment deems acceptable, and by presenting ourselves to others in the way we wish to be seen."
Persona5,3ba62i,assassassin_,3,Wed Jul 1 04:52:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's how you activate the persona? Like when the Protagonist awakens Arsène he doesn't have his mask on. It also seems like you revert people back to normal (after they become shadows/demons) is to rip off their mask.  I don't know, just throwing out ideas here."
Persona5,3ba62i,NateDizzle312,3,Sat Jun 27 07:14:22 2015 UTC,"Here is the most basic input (that nobody else has brought): The word Persona, literally meant mask in ancient greek. In the theater, the actor would put on a mask correlating to a specific role and it was possible for one actor to switch between different roles, by swapping masks.  Maybe each Persona has its own mask and you acquire them by stealing them from shadows (keeping with the thief theme)."
Persona5,3ba62i,OhZordan,2,Mon Jun 29 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"From Jungian psychology:   The persona, for Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, was the social face the individual presented to the world—""a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual"".[1]  Identification - “the danger is that [people] become identical with their personas—the professor with his textbook, the tenor with his voice.”[3] The result could be “the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality which is 'all persona', with its excessive concern for 'what people think'”[4]—an unreflecting state of mind 'in which people are utterly unconscious of any distinction between themselves and the world in which they live. They have little or no concept of themselves as beings distinct from what society expects of them'.[5] The stage was set thereby for what Jung termed enantiodromia—the emergence of the repressed individuality from beneath the persona later in life: 'the individual will either be completely smothered under an empty persona or an enantiodromia into the buried opposites will occur'.[6]  Disintegration - “The breakdown of the persona constitutes the typically Jungian moment both in therapy and in development” — the “moment” when “that excessive commitment to collective ideals masking deeper individuality—the persona—breaks down... disintegrates.”[7] Given Jung’s view that “the persona is a semblance... the dissolution of the persona is therefore absolutely necessary for individuation.”[8] Nevertheless, its disintegration may well lead initially to a state of chaos in the individual: ’one result of the dissolution of the persona is the release of fantasy... disorientation.’[9] As the individuation process gets under way, ’the situation has thrown off the conventional husk and developed into a stark encounter with reality, with no false veils or adornments of any kind’.[10]   From here, there are three things that can happen:   Negative restoration - One possible reaction to the resulting experience of archetypal chaos was what Jung called ""the regressive restoration of the persona"", whereby the protagonist ""laboriously tries to patch up his social reputation within the confines of a much more limited personality... pretending that he is as he was before the crucial experience.""[11] Similarly in treatment there can be ""the persona-restoring phase, which is an effort to maintain superficiality"";[12] or even a longer phase designed not to promote individuation but to bring about what Jung caricatured as ""the negative restoration of the persona"" — that is to say, a reversion to the status quo'.[13]  Absence - The alternative is to endure living with the absence of the persona — and for Jung ""the man with no persona... is blind to the reality of the world, which for him has merely the value of an amusing or fantastic playground.""[14] Inevitably, the result of ""the streaming in of the unconscious into the conscious realm, simultaneously with the dissolution of the 'persona' and the reduction of the directive force of consciousness, is a state of disturbed psychic equilibrium.""[15] Those trapped at such a stage remain ""blind to the world, hopeless dreamers... spectral Cassandras dreaded for their tactlessness, eternally misunderstood.""[16]  Restoration - Recovery, the aim of individuation, ""is not only achieved by work on the inside figures but also, as conditio sine qua non, by a readaptation in outer life""[17]—including the recreation of a new and more viable persona. To ""develop a stronger persona... might feel inauthentic, like learning to ""play a role""... but if one cannot perform a social role then one will suffer"".[18] Thus one goal for individuation is for people to ""develop a more realistic, flexible persona that helps them navigate in society but does not collide with nor hide their true self"".[19] Eventually, ""in the best case, the persona is appropriate and tasteful, a true reflection of our inner individuality and our outward sense of self.""[20]   So basically, everyone is made up of two parts: a raw, unfiltered shadow, which is the true self, and a persona, or mask, which hides the true self as well as allows you to function in society.   I think something happens in P5 that causes the Persona to take over the mind (Identification) - ""The result could be “the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality which is 'all persona', with its excessive concern for 'what people think'”[4]."" This is represented by the MC's mask fusing with his face in the trailer.   However, the MC is able to rip off the mask, and the persona, separating it from his mind (Disintegration). ""that excessive commitment to collective ideals masking deeper individuality—the persona—breaks down... disintegrates ... disintegration may well lead initially to a state of chaos in the individual: ’one result of the dissolution of the persona is the release of fantasy."" This is represented by the yellow shadow eyes that appear on the MC, as well as the dual personalities he seems to have. This also fits with the themes of freedom, individuality, breaking your chains, and stealing back your future.   In an interview, Atlus said "" If there’s one thing that lies at the center of our themes in the game, it’s the notion people have that there are things that they want to do with their lives but can’t actually realize for one reason or another. They’ve got something circumstantial holding them back or maybe it’s even just the rational half of their brain."" This problem is caused by the over-identification with the persona, and is solved by disintegrating it. This is why the MC is trying to rip the mask off the enemy. The enemies are people whose individuality ""has been completely smothered under an empty persona"" - which is represented by the mask fused onto their faces, and ultimately their transformation into a Persona.  I'm not exactly sure what happens in the next part - We see the MC separate from his Persona, but then he immediately summons it. Either he creates a new, stronger Persona (Restoration), or he remains detached from the Persona, but holds onto it so that he can use it as a weapon (Absence). Or, he reverses the places of his persona and shadow (Negative restoration).  All the themes from the Persona series come straight from Jungian psychology. You can read up on the Jungian persona here,   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology)  and the Jungian shadow here.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)"
Persona5,3ba62i,assassassin_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:33 2015 UTC,Maybe the main character is originally quiet and really unsocial because of fear of being judged or cast out by society and because of that he wears a metaphorical mask where he's quiet and nice when in reality he's got a fun personality as it seems if it's something like that then once again Atlus has nailed that feeling of i can connect with these characters because of my own life.
Persona5,3ba62i,Juriga,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:05:35 2015 UTC,I get a little Bleach vibe from the masks.. I have a feeling that once they don the masks their personalities are immensly affected by their shadow selves and in a way their body is taken over by their shadow and thus giving them strength to fight.

But with P5 set where it is I don't know if it's entirely necessary.

Persona5,3b8by7,Jamvaan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:40:18 2015 UTC,I personally see it as more realistic due to the fact it's going to be set in Tokyo and not a fictional city in Japan.

Unless atlus is just trolling us.  Edit: Used the wrong pronoun"
Persona5,3b1f9r,smiauf,6,Thu Jun 25 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"I´ve been thinking about it a bit for a while and started asking myself what the scene where his holding the card up actually is. It seems unlikely that the protagonist would be thrown into jail with his school uniform so I thought it would rather be the moment he’s getting to his school for the first time. The whole set of numbers and letters may just be his student ID and the ""mugshot"" might just be his picture for his academic file or ID as well.   Now about the whole numbers and letters there are several possibilities. The one I’m currently holding as the most likely, until a better idea comes to mind, is that TS stands for ""TenkouSei"" (which incidentally is also TS for Transfer Student). If it is his ID number it would make sense that it contains a code to determine he’s a transfer student and not a regular who started from the first year at that school. Plus the mugshot scene would kind of make sense with the whole “Shujin” (prisoner) High School theme.  In any case I have no way of proving this nor any other theory I had so far. I do like the TS Elliot approach but can’t see why it´ll be there other than it being some kind of easter egg (?). Even then I´m still not convinced this has anything to do with the release date."
Persona5,3b1f9r,strikercja,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"I like this theory, it makes a lot of sense. The number could then be his date of birth. If he's born in 1989 it makes him 16 in 2015. With his birthday on the fourth of may then."

Persona5,3b1f9r,RozJC,3,Fri Jun 26 12:44:42 2015 UTC,What if the whole date is backwards?  e.g. 4/5/98  That would put him at 17 years old.
Persona5,3b1f9r,strikercja,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"Its possible though it would make him a year too old to be a second year student. Would mean he had to redo a year, not impossible."
Persona5,3b1f9r,assassassin_,3,Fri Jun 26 13:01:05 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Japanese kids turn 17 during their second year.  15-16 first year  16-17 second year  17-18 third year and when they graduate  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Japan
Persona5,3b1f9r,strikercja,4,Fri Jun 26 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"TS could stand for Top Secret,  Tokyo gameShow or could be the MC's initials. The numbers are still mystery to me and I doubt that they are random. If they truly were random it wouldn't start with P5."

Persona5,3aytaa,NateDizzle312,5,Wed Jun 24 19:43:27 2015 UTC,To be fair it is their work so I think they want to be the ones who make the announcement.  Or it's a PR thing and they have a set release date to announce this
Persona5,3aytaa,strikercja,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:24:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I get that but honestly what did they expect when they release it with P4DAN.
Persona5,3aytaa,ThatAeroGuy,6,Wed Jun 24 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, Persona 5 is looking like a fusion of modern Persona and old-school Persona/SMT. Great way to change things up.  Things I've Picked Up On: - People turn into Shadows (and then into demons/personas) - Two dungeons are shown in the trailer (medieval castle + casino) - The blue-haired boy could be some sort of guidance figure.   I'm assuming they're elaborating on the P3 negative emotions and wish for death = shadows being formed and also elaborating on the whole shadows being untamed Personas idea.   It's most likely that the dungeon with the cages is a tutorial dungeon, since it's fairly early on in April and the cages seem to be a motif that represents persona summoning.   I don't think the blue-haired guy is a party member, doesn't seem like a party member would make comments on their adventure like that. He could be the fox shown in PV1, but he seems like a third-party plot character like Philemon or Nyarlathotep."

He could be the fox shown in PV1, but he seems like a third-party plot character like Philemon or Nyarlathotep.   I agree, but it's worth noting that the message ""Are they on the road to glory? Or ruin?"" isn't shown to be written by him. You see it on the walls, then it cuts to a blank wall which he then paints on. When it cuts to the wider shot of him, the only thing written is ""Never give in"" over and over again."
Persona5,3aytaa,DejWoSWK,2,Wed Jun 24 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"He reminded me of Tatsuya from P2,for reasons I can not really explain. But considering that he has become a detective and the game is about crime,it could be nice to see him there."
Persona5,3aytaa,ThatAeroGuy,2,Thu Jun 25 06:20:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, while I agree somewhat, I think people want direct cameos too much. P5 is its own game, just like any other entry.   I hope if any former characters return, maybe its in the form of a talkshow like in P3 where they talk about the fates of the previous characters. I don't really want any main characters to physically show up, excluding Elizabeth and other third party characters I guess. I can definitely see what you mean though, he reminds me of Tatsuya a bit yeah, especially in Eternal Punishment."

I thought that it was cool but it seemed a little bit more thrown together than the first gameplay trailer we saw.  Also, they reused a lot of the same footage which was unfortunate.  I did like that it had blood though, it looks to be much darker than Persona 4"
Persona5,3aytaa,strikercja,3,Wed Jun 24 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is unfortunate. I don't know about the darker thing.

Persona5,3az4a5,Aulti,2,Wed Jun 24 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, Fallout and Shenmue, but honestly I don't thing it will. Persons just doesn't have that much of a larger audience."
Persona5,3az67k,Neoncloudff,6,Wed Jun 24 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"People on NeoGaf have been throwing around September 8th 2015 based on the ID board the MC holds up that reads ""P50895TS"". That sounds like some insane Metal Gear type stuff but I really want to believe it. It helps that September 8th is also a Tuesday, the traditional day of game releases in the US."
Persona5,3az67k,Jamvaan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"Yep I was looking over that ID board as well. Doubt it though, means it will release before P4DAN in US. Maybe it's the Japanese release date, that's still possible."
Persona5,3az67k,strikercja,2,Wed Jun 24 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Doubt it though, means it will release before P4DAN in US.   Especially since Tokyo Game Show starts on September 17th"
Persona5,3az67k,NateDizzle312,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:59:12 2015 UTC,I mean it's not entirely crazy to look at Persona 5s hype train flying off the rails and the niche market that is the Vita in the US and prioritize translation of one over the other.
Persona5,3az67k,Jamvaan,2,Wed Jun 24 18:10:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it's possible I just don't want to get too hyped :p.
Persona5,3az67k,strikercja,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:13:31 2015 UTC,I thought they had said they're aiming for a simultaneous release for both JP and US?
Persona5,3az67k,MentalNeko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too. It would be awesome if they release it in September without showing us too much about the game. It's more fun to find and experience things yourself in a game like this, rather than watch a trailer which kills the surprise."
Persona5,3az67k,rpg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:43:31 2015 UTC,Direct Link  I found this while rewetting the trailer...can anybody find anymore numbers?  Or am I just crazy?

Persona5,3av50w,asterack,17,Tue Jun 23 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"probably just an up port with a higher fps/resolution on the PS4 version.  They won't make the PS3 version inferior in content, as it will sell the most copies in Japan."
Persona5,3av50w,Cisce,7,Tue Jun 23 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt that there will be any content differences. PS4 version will probably run in 1080p 60fps with some nice anti-aliasing, but that's about it."
Persona5,3av50w,RaspberryV,5,Tue Jun 23 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"Nothing's confirmed at the moment, but my guess?  PS3 will be 720p, PS4 will be 1080p  PS3 will experience framedrops more often than PS4.  Longer loading times on PS3.(This is a given)  PS3 version might require an install.  Some minor aesthetics stuff will be lacking on PS3, most likely shadowing will be rougher and certain lighting effects will be omitted. The usual cross-gen stuff."
Persona5,3av50w,thegreathobbyist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"All PS4 games run off the hard drive, so if anything the PS3 will be less of an install."

Persona5,3av50w,xach_hill,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:33:01 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the emulator will be ready by the time p5 comes out. Not likely.
Persona5,3av50w,jukerainbows,2,Sat Jun 27 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"The only actual ps3 emulator so far has a frame rate of about 1-2 fps because of how different the cell architecture is.

Persona5,3av50w,Akimuno,0,Sun Jun 28 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"You missed that footage where an emulator was running at somewhere between 10-20 fps. Textures were misplaced and shit, but hey, progress."

I saw it on NeoGAF before that guys twitter but no one claimed a source. I'm assuming there is some japanese forum that someone is posting these in and it's not 2ch.
Persona5,3asltr,z3lus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:34:09 2015 UTC,The guy who was streaming P4:DAN. He keeps teasing but now he's streaming another game.

Persona5,3asltr,z3lus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:37:50 2015 UTC,Yeah probably but I have been teased long enough now :p.
Persona5,3asltr,strikercja,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:40:12 2015 UTC,Also is that Norn I see that Arsene is fighting?? ;O
Persona5,3asltr,hanky2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:51:31 2015 UTC,I just noticed the HP and SP on the protagonist. It's way higher than shown in the first trailer suggesting this is way later in the game? But the fact that he is fighting alone here would contradict that maybe.
Persona5,3asltr,Buh9410,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:31:03 2015 UTC,Huh so I guess that one theory that they turn into their Personas is debunked.

Persona5,3at8gk,dualstrike98,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:06:12 2015 UTC,He's definitely Fool arcana. It was shown in the military shop footage from the first trailer
Persona5,3am9n2,CaptainGongan,12,Sun Jun 21 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't want it any bigger. It just isn't needed. The overworld just serves as a way to interact with shops and people and for that it works perfectly. Any bigger and it would become way more of a chore to go to various shops or find out where characters are on the map. For me, the overworld is what I care the least about. I hadn't even given it any thought before now."
Persona5,3am9n2,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Sun Jun 21 21:06:47 2015 UTC,They might make exploring more fun in this one though in which case a bigger map would be cool.
Persona5,3am9n2,hanky2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Exploring is a dungeon thing. The hub town needs to be tightly and conveniently designed as a stage for events, social links and shops.  Nothing else really."
Persona5,3am9n2,ovoon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:27:31 2015 UTC,True I guess I actually want dungeons to be more interesting and from the trailer I think it will be.
Persona5,3am9n2,hanky2,7,Tue Jun 23 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"Relating to your doorways/'gates' that connect the areas, I think that will probably be the subway system no? I think it'll be cool if you could use the subway to travel around the city."
Persona5,3am9n2,Mikmok,3,Sun Jun 21 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I was fine with the size of the town in Persona 4.  I wouldn't turn down a larger one though.  Persona 5 will probably be bigger, since it's several years since Persona 4 was released and Persona 5 is set in Tokyo, rather than a tiny little town."
Persona5,3am9n2,Hero-Sloth,2,Sun Jun 21 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"If it's the size of P4 I'd be happy, though a larger and more detailed map is something I'd be happy to see. It doesn't need to be massive, maybe what I'd actually prefer is a evolving world the same size as P4.  As you said, taking place in Tokyo I'd expect it to be naturally larger than P4. Honestly it was never an area I felt needed to be improved. I personally don't play Persona to explore the map, especially after 10 or so hours in once you've seen everything. So I think that's why for me personally, I'd want a map that has certain areas change or develop over time. Gives me reason to come back to a certain area other than just finishing quest stuff."
Persona5,3am9n2,Dark_Knight_Reddits,2,Sun Jun 21 22:57:55 2015 UTC,I don't expect it to be the size of Inaba but nothing mind-blowing.   Dungeons though could get a little more flare to make them a bit more interesting.
Persona5,3am9n2,deevees,2,Mon Jun 22 11:43:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe a little bigger, but not by much. The worlds of P3 and P4 never felt tiny to me, but tight. Every place is meaningful."
Persona5,3am9n2,PeteOverdrive,2,Mon Jun 22 23:33:56 2015 UTC,I really want to be bigger than P4 without any of the loading / world map selecting but not too big at the same time.
Persona5,3am9n2,-Vertex-,2,Fri Jun 26 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly the world size has never been much of a sticking point for me, if it was just menus I don't think I'd care very much. If it maintains P3:FES/P4:G size world with an engaging story, characters, fun combat and dungeons I'm totally fine."
Persona5,3am9n2,Jamvaan,2,Sun Jun 21 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"For what? The game is really going into the dungeon to explore, the other locations are only to go shop for weapons/ supplies, to increase stats or for the dates with the NPCs, there's really no reason to have a huge map for that"
Persona5,3am9n2,mrgmzc,4,Sun Jun 21 16:51:10 2015 UTC,The overworld is what breaks up the monotony of grinding in dungeons. I don't want to come up to the same three areas for the duration of the game.
Persona5,3am9n2,PorkBeanOuttaGas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think that's the characters in the overworld, not really the overworld itself. If there are lots of things to do and people to interact with then it doesn't need to be huge."
Persona5,3am9n2,Policeman333,3,Mon Jun 22 12:46:43 2015 UTC,The game is really going into the dungeon to explore   For you. I prefer what happens in the overworld over being in dungeons.
Persona5,3am9n2,strikercja,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:46:19 2015 UTC,Interesting question. P2 originally came out on the ps2 if I'm correct so even with the improved graphics I'm sure that the ps3 can handle a bigger map. So yeah it would be interesting to see just how big Tokyo is. Maybe we'll get a glimpse in PV2.
Persona5,3am9n2,Harry-kun,5,Sun Jun 21 17:01:29 2015 UTC,P2 originally came out on the ps2   Wait what!?
Persona5,3am9n2,strikercja,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Meant Persona 4, my bad."
Persona5,3am9n2,ThatGuyfromNI,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"If it's bigger than P4 then that's fine, but personally I love Inaba's size (plus the Shopping District just has a really nice design IMO).   Big maps when you are outside dungeons are rather unnecessary, and if the quest system returns a big map could get very tedious. Again, P4's size was ideal for me, but if they go bigger for the city and pull it off well I'm all for it."
Persona5,3am9n2,Aulti,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:28:03 2015 UTC,From what I've heard and think the map will be much larger.  And as you mentioned that P4 being in rural town was smaller so P5 will be a lot bigger since it's in Tokyo.
Persona5,3am9n2,dualstrike98,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:41:57 2015 UTC,"Its not even about system limitations, its all about the setting. Im pretty sure they want us to get the feeling of that whole ""being trapped by society"" business, and i feel that a big map would drive that. Just seeing so many people bustling by, and just blending in adds to all of that, so I'm hoping for a far larger map than weve ever seen before, while still keeping lots of stuff to do to make it not absolutely boring"
Persona5,3am6zi,NateDizzle312,5,Sun Jun 21 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"All I really want at this point is a date and a name for the protagonist. I hope it's just filled in like with SMT IV because going in as ""Dirk Dickbutt"" alongside these other named characters seems odd."
Persona5,3am6zi,Jamvaan,3,Sun Jun 21 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, when I started playing Persona 4 I didn't look into the characters at all. So now, even though I have an Asian last name, it just seems out of place compared to everyone else."
Persona5,3am6zi,silvershadow881,2,Sun Jun 21 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't get a name for the protagonist in years. Like they did with P3 and P4  The joy of these games is that the protagonist is an empty shell for you to fill it, I would hate if they forced a name so early. It's just like reading a book after watching a movie and being stripped of the magic of imagining characters on your own, instead of picturing them as their respective actors.  Specially because you gotta love the nicknames the fanbase uses, such as blue jesus, Brotag, Kenpachi, Potter-kun and so forth."

Ofcourse Igor and the name for the two shopkeepers is also known: Iwai Munehisa and Tae Takemi. Found these on the persona 5 wiki.  Now for what I would like to see. Probably some more actual gameplay. I'm personally not too fussed about a new character. Maybe see some dialogue though it would be japanese but still. A quick look at the new social link would also be nice. I'm crossing my fingers for a release date though I don't think we'll see one. That will probably come at the Tokyo game show.   I really can't wait for PV2, checking everyday to see if it somehow leaked somewhere."

Persona5,3amccd,strikercja,3,Sun Jun 21 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"Going strictly by the wiki here so take that for what it's worth. ""Hashino confirmed that the basic preparations for the development were finished and announced the return of Shigenori Soejima and Shoji Meguro as character designer and music composer, respectively. Both Soejima and Meguro previously worked together with Hashino on Persona 3, Persona 4 and Catherine."" Source: http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Persona_5"

I think the reason why it looks so similar to Catherine was that they were experimenting with a new style in Catherine. They used an external engine to develop that game, and I think they really liked how it looked, and decided to build a whole new engine that looked a lot like it. I enjoyed the Catherine art style, so I'm glad its also being implemented in P5"

Unless Atlus Japan has something ready, Atlus USA cannot do anything about it in E3. Atlus Japan does not attend E3 every year, instead making Nintendo showcase their games like SMTxFE (or whatever they call it now).  Thus, Atlus USA, without any material to translate, cannot do jack shit because they do not PRODUCE content.

Persona5,3aeevm,HolyKnightPrime,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"definitely try persona 3. It has a more creepier and emotional story, whereas persona 4 was more cheery and ""slice of life"". The two stories are very different, but the gameplay isn't completely changed. You still walk around with a sword and friends killing shadows, but the only downside in persona 3 is the tediousness. Its massive dungeon base, which is over 200 floors (and the floors are basically the same as the ones in persona 4). Overall the game is good, it won't take your whole life to finish and its characters arent as great as the persona 4 ones (except the MC), but its story is very different from the sequel and it makes you take a different tone to the persona series."
Persona5,3a85ar,Alucard_The_Magus,8,Wed Jun 17 23:52:49 2015 UTC,50/50  Mainly because I feel as though they're going for P4 with huge upgrades and a new story.

The whole process kinda reminded me of a tibetan sand mandala, creation to deconstruction.  I grinded his stats through the whole game, upped his skills, did social links, fused personas, basically developed my protag and his friends sort of felt like my friends in a way.   it was like all of that was gone, and it did feel a bit empty.  It was a bit much for me; I just didn't handle it well, as silly as that might sound."
Persona5,3a85ar,joejackson62,4,Thu Jun 18 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound silly to me. When a game leaves you with a feeling as strong as that, then in my opinion they have done a game right. I myself was devastated quite a bit at the last month in the game. Made me wonder why the hell I was even playing the game. The true genius of the game is where it leaves you off at that point (something which other games in the series haven't been able to capture yet). All the relationships you made, all the personae you collected, just about everything you did so far, it would be all for naught unless you carry on."
Persona5,3a85ar,Aerys12,4,Thu Jun 18 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"I think they lost the charm P3 had, I think forever. When a game has a sad ending it's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. It will leave it's mark in you and that's brilliant."

But all the stuff coming out for Persona 5 has looked so good, so slick, so polished, and so just gosh-darned STYLISH that it's going to probably become my favorite game of all time, period. The story and characters seem a LITTLE more relatable-I mean, there's only so far you can relate to kids who are secretly phantom thieves. But they're not perfect characters, according to the creators, like the characters from 3 and 4. They're trouble kids, delinquents, Kanji but with a reputation that's actually deserved. The battle system looks interesting, nothing too far out of the norm but again, extremely stylish looking, with speculation you might have to capture Personas again. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE thief stories and stealth games, so to see that merged with my favorite game series of all time is like a dream come true. It's music is going to be awesome, if they stick to the inspiration. You get to play as a stylish thief. Have I mentioned how stylish the game looks? It's oozing with personality, graphically, way more than any other Persona game IMO. I know I've gone on for a while, but I'm just so excited and I just love Persona so much."

P5 will be the first game in the series that I'm gonna experience organically; that is, before all the LPs and guides are out. That aside, I'm loving what I'm seeing so far. The fact that it's set in Tokyo, the visual style, the soundtrack. As much as I love P4G, I like what I see of P5 that much more."
Persona5,3a85ar,ThatBlueHatGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"It has my favorite art direction by far. High contrasts and bold use of color, I think it's great. And I like that the main character will have a lot more personality. We have two minutes of footage and maybe it was just PS2 limitations. But his mannerisms and movement have a lot more personality than the blank-slate stiffs you play as in 3 and 4.  Persona 3 and 4 felt really safe to me. This game feels still safe, but not nearly as safe as the last two. And that means a lot"
Persona5,3a85ar,catpelican,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"I certainly think it's got the nicest style of what we've seen.  It looks to be more of an evolution on the formula than P4 was, so it'll probably feel newer and more exciting than that did. What it'll come down to is how good the changes they make are, and if they can create another great cast."
Persona5,3a37xn,dualstrike98,3,Tue Jun 16 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"What did you guys see in this video?   -It seemed to start off with someone's eye (not human) -Then some room with carpets and a figure in the foreground  my guessing The main character inside the casino. -Then, I shit you not, It seems like Teddie's head turning from right to left. -Now comes a scene I'm most sure about - a dead body. - Then a light obelisk amongst in a red land. Probably the place where heroes fight the shadows/demons. -Main character falling down and landing on his feet.  Did you guys see the same thing?"
Persona5,3a37xn,Maikuboy,2,Wed Jun 17 12:38:14 2015 UTC,I think it's the cat Morgana and not Teddie.

Morgana has a black head, white mouth and red eyes. And the proportions between the head and the eyes are much more similar to Teddie (huge head, smaller eyes while morgana has smaller head and big eyes). It has to be Teddie."

Persona5,3a37xn,strikercja,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:34:13 2015 UTC,You're probably right but it just seems off to me that Teddie would be back.

All you have to remember is that you'll need to purchase any DLC through the US store and to make sure that the console is set as the primary machine for the US account.
Persona5,3a3bhu,AngelhunterUK,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:13:18 2015 UTC,That's such a relief.   I hadn't thought about DLC.. SMT4 had some good DLC that I enjoyed but I hadn't considered that as an option for Persona.

Once bought with a us account can you just log on with your european and play the game or do you have to be logged in with the us account to be able to play? Also how does it work with your wallet? Say I have 50 euros in it, is it just transferred to dollars or do I need to buy a us voucher?"
Persona5,3a3bhu,Hero-Sloth,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:18:30 2015 UTC,"So you'll need to log on to the US account on your PS4 and set that PS4 as that account's primary console. That means that when other users log on, they'll be able to play the games that the US account has bought.  It doesn't automatically change currencies. You'll have to go on a site and buy a US voucher. My recommendation is pcgamesupply.com because they've been perfect the times I've used it."

Persona5,38pv7f,TotallyNotALoli,3,Thu Jun 11 14:37:38 2015 UTC,This is just pure speculation but what if the shadow somewhat takes over the MCs and causes them to commit these thieving acts and in doing so achieve some sort of emotional purging? Just a thought but I feel like persona would go for something edgy like that.
Persona5,38pv7f,Fruitforthought,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:38:01 2015 UTC,"I WISH the protagonist would have a operational and thematic shadow as that would indicate he wouldn't be a cipher protagonist anymore - even if the shadow concept is kinda cringe.  However, as P4 shows (where the protagonist never faces his shadow), i doubt Atlus is ready to abandon the trope."
Persona5,38pv7f,SCO_1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:05:01 2015 UTC,Who's to say MC's Shadow is bad? maybe his Shadow is some form of combat mechanic that significantly increases damage but slightly decreases Health and Defense for a few turns.
Persona5,37iwxo,chies_is_the_man,3,Wed May 27 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I don't really know... the point of battles is to help the player level up and... oh, right, they are also the core of the game. Avoiding battles frequently seems like a bad idea.   I'm not even going to say how I think stealth mechanics will be used, srsly, I have no idea. But the few seconds we've seen of them look awesome indeed."
Persona5,37iwxo,Nagi_,1 point,Thu May 28 00:45:44 2015 UTC,Maybe there are gonna be enemies in certain areas that are really strong and you have to avoid then until you level enough to take them on. Seems like a weird mechanic but people who've played persona games know to fight as many enemies as possible as it only benefits you.
Persona5,37iwxo,Riendum121,1 point,Sun May 31 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"Well, there is the Reaper.  No one wants to fight the Reaper. He only wants a hug ;("

Persona5,37iwxo,kapparino-feederino,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"My guess? Its a way around battles. Instead of making more open dungeons, they can make them more tight and nice looking while also providing the freedom to get around enemies.  Basically, I think it might be a compensation for less movement flexibility in dungeons."
Persona5,36fx8p,CopyriteInc,4,Tue May 19 02:01:44 2015 UTC,Or maybe they're just going to stick with established series premises and they're demons.

Persona5,36fx8p,rhapsodyinawesome,2,Mon May 25 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think bringing Demons back is exciting. Besides, the whole idea of Personas being killable trash mobs goes against what a Persona is at the fundamental level. A ""wild persona"" is just a shadow."
Persona5,36fx8p,assassassin_,1 point,Mon May 25 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"From interviews we know the MC's problem is a mental one ( he's trapped in a ""mental prison"").   The big theme in P5 is supposedly freedom, or breaking free from your chains. A persona represents a mask used to face reality, which basically controls your true feelings so that you can function like a normal person in society. Fighting against persona would definitely fit with the theme of freedom (or taking off a mask). Maybe the villain is somehow transforming shadows into Persona, and then sending them into peoples' heads in order to control them (personality is determined by arcana). A natural persona controls your true feelings, but maybe a foreign persona would completely suppress them. Think of it as being forced to wear a mask that doesn't fit you.   I'm completely talking out of my ass, but I honestly think the enemies in the trailer could be anything. We really don't know enough to be making assumptions. But it's definitely plausible for them to be demons OR persona. They could easily find a way to work in persona as trash mobs."
Persona5,36fx8p,Armanlex,1 point,Mon May 25 20:09:52 2015 UTC,That sounds plausible.
Persona5,36fx8p,chies_is_the_man,1 point,Tue May 19 06:25:01 2015 UTC,"In Persona 4 you got your person to help you fight against shadows, a sort of symbolic representation on the themes of Persona. What if in this game its the other way around and your using shadows to fight personas and by defeating the personas you help free the person, who owned that persona, from their facade. It would fit the theme of the game since the characters are fighting against the rules society forces on them, meaning they might be fighting against the way society forces them to put on these facades. Plus, at the end of the gameplay trailer the protagonist has yellow eyes (like a shadow) before turning into what looks like his ""persona"", which could actually be his shadow."
Persona5,36fx8p,ContinuumKing,1 point,Thu May 28 05:53:00 2015 UTC,"But persona's are the manifestation of the ""true"" self. Not the facade. Fighting them to free someone from a facade wouldn't make sense. If anything, you would fight persona's to suppress the true self, not free it."
Persona5,36fx8p,assassassin_,2,Thu May 28 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"Shadow selves are the true self. Personas are masks which hide/control the true self. If someone's being a dick to you, you may want to punch them in the face, but you don't because you'd go to jail and it's not socially acceptable to do. In this scenario the shadow would be the inner feelings of wanting to hurt the guy, and your Persona would be how you control those feelings and don't punch him.   The word persona literally means 'mask' in Latin. The definition of persona is ""the aspect of someone's character that is presented to or perceived by others"" or ""a social role or a character played by an actor."" So a persona is the complete opposite of the true self. It's basically the way you act in front of other people. Personas are actually referred to as facades and masks in the games."

Persona5,36fx8p,BlakCake,-5,Wed Jul 1 20:41:56 2015 UTC,Good Theory but the most recent screenshots reveal that the trailer date was just a placeholder. If you see the dates on the screenshots they're all different.

It's possible that you simply gain this menu item once you progress far enough into the game, as well (like 3 or 4 days maybe?).  There's also a new system that looks like it may replace Social Links. It also might be the Social Link system, but under a different name.

Persona5,35hnp5,kapparino-feederino,1 point,Tue May 12 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"well, for me personally. i think it just japanese way of saying s.link  because i think in persona 3 and 4 (japan version) the s.link menu is not called s.link  its called commu or something i kinda forgot  so its possible they just called it differently in japan"

Persona5,35hnp5,strikercja,-1,Sun Jun 21 11:16:01 2015 UTC,"IIRC they aren't doing social links in P5, but there's a new mechanic that will replace them. Might be very similar though."
Persona5,35hnp5,strikercja,1 point,Sun May 10 15:58:28 2015 UTC,"Huh, sounds interesting! It does seem that our party will consist of those 4 characters we've seen in that trailer, I wonder if that new mechanic will revolve around that."
Persona5,35hnp5,Grizzly_Storm,1 point,Sun May 10 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"Though the four we saw are just the starting party, they did confirm more party members as the story goes on. Much like in P4 where Yosuke, Chie and Yukiko are the first party members."

Persona5,35hnp5,DMthePerson,2,Mon May 11 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"Not only do I agree that there will be more party members, but I think we have already had a small gimpse in the trailer.   Anybody remember the guy with the fox looking mask and tail who is seen for a brief moment? I think he could be one of the new members later on in the game.

Persona5,35hnp5,DMthePerson,1 point,Mon May 11 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"Some people believe that that's just another form that Morgana will take. Ever seen One Piece? It's like Chopper's default points; the original cat (reindeer) form, the bipedal, cute hybrid form, and the humanoid, masked form."
Persona5,35hnp5,DMthePerson,1 point,Wed May 13 20:54:05 2015 UTC,"I believe it to be a different character, I just don't feel the same vibe as Morgana from that character design.   The mask looks a bit too fox like and the tail is white with red strikes, not black with a white end like Morganas.   That would mean Morganas tail would have to change colour, because even when the cartoonish mascot form was shown in the stylisation, it had a black tail with a white end.  It's also true that the stylisation made colours change, for example Anne's eyes are a different colour between gameplay and stylisation. But, Morgana has a black tail with a white end in gameplay, stylisation and in both of the confirmed forms.  So, it's true that you make a good point and it is a possibility that it's Morgana and that there are multiple transformation points. It's just that it seems weird to change tail colours."
Persona5,35d09i,shiroknight,6,Sat May 9 03:08:56 2015 UTC,"Nope. In Japan they write the date as Year/Month/Day so it'd actually be the 11th of April. I'd guess that the date has no relevance because the Persona games often begin with you moving in around April, and this just seems to be continuing this trend."
Persona5,35d09i,SuperMrMojo,1 point,Sat May 9 07:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. Not to mention, there are new dates in some of the new screenshots. Though even the new dates indicate the year 2016, meaning the game taking place is 2016 is very likely.  I just can't see it being a hidden message for a release date though, there's a chance those in game events genuinely happen during April."
Persona5,35d09i,Grizzly_Storm,3,Sat May 9 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"I just hope it gets released this year bro, as of right now I cant pre order it anywhere and this years almost half way done. Plus japan needs to get it first and im pretty sure well get it 1-3 months after them."

Persona5,34uguc,Miller777,13,Mon May 4 17:39:18 2015 UTC,Series.  Even though P4 wasnt that great. I think it does more respect to the whole story. And cramming it to 90 minutes just doesn't justify it completely.
Persona5,34uguc,Rinaldootje,3,Mon May 4 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"By movie series I meant more than just one to adapt the game!  Persona 3 is having an adaptation of more than 1 movie, the 3rd one aired last month"
Persona5,34uguc,ThatGuyfromNI,3,Mon May 4 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"That depends on the story. I feel like P3 was more suited to movies and P4 as TV anime. I'm completely fine with what we have (P4TA was just okay though, 4GTA was awful).  It depends on how the plot ends up. P4 was a lot more character centric rather than the plot, making a series seem like the better choice, while P3 has an arguably better plot overall."
Persona5,34uguc,DaxterAttano,3,Tue May 5 06:56:49 2015 UTC,Anime.  I would think by this time Persona would be popular enough to warrant a decent series IMO.
Persona5,34uguc,Grizzly_Storm,2,Mon May 4 19:36:45 2015 UTC,Movies. I've only seen the first movie for P3. but that seemed a whole lot better than the fan serviced up series for P4.
Persona5,34uguc,KuroiInazuma,1 point,Wed May 6 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"Hard decision. I don't like the release schedule of movie series, sometimes they don't have a schedule at all and are all over the place.  But it's clear that the Persona 3 movie series is much better than the Persona 4 tv series in almost every area. Luckily, it doesn't really effect me since I will always prefer the games over adaptations.  I think they should have adapted Persona 1 and 2 into a series, I know their stories but the games are harder to sit through if you are coming from 3 and 4."

Persona5,34uguc,Thrashinuva,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:32:42 2015 UTC,Neither if the story isn't done well.  Entertaining the thought that the game will get an animated adaption before seeing the game itself is dangerous territory wherein it could affect the actual writing and pacing of the game.  We won't know for sure until after we play it which media format would be better suited for an adaptation.
Persona5,34uguc,kazoodles,-9,Tue May 5 19:55:02 2015 UTC,Definitely movies.  The P4 anime was terrible :(

Persona5,34l6x2,FluxWaveZ,2,Sat May 2 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"No, he's right: none of these are new. All of these are (cropped) on the official website, for example. They've also been featured in scans across various magazines like Famitsu, Dengeki and the Persona Magazine #2015 February issue."

Persona5,34j0cs,Mister_Cat,3,Fri May 1 15:44:44 2015 UTC,persona 3 FES. the only problem with it is that you can't fully control your party members
Persona5,34j0cs,PinkGoldJigglypuff,6,Thu May 7 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend playing though the game twice: 1st time: P3FES, playthrough as a boy, get used to that soundtrack, those social links (you don't have a choice in this one)  2nd time: P3P, as a girl.  The OST totally changes, the social links are (in my opinion) way better.  I actually like girl MC the most. But the change in social links is bigger and any of the changes in P4G combined.  It's also the optimal version for going though the game again, because the combat got an overhaul, and you go through the game faster due to quick load times and easy map travel.   I love P3P but feel bad for people who didn't play the PS2 version first."
Persona5,34j0cs,ovoon,2,Fri May 1 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"If you want to walk around and have a similar experience to P4, Persona 3: FES is the version for you. It's either that or P3P. P3FES has an epilogue story called the answer too, but you can't control other characters in combat. P3FES has cutscenes as well."
Persona5,34j0cs,Maccussa,1 point,Fri May 1 16:27:46 2015 UTC,FES is the best version assuming you don't care about portability or a non-canon female protagonist. FES has actual cutscenes and an epilogue.  The movement system is exactly the same as Persona 4/Golden as well.
Persona5,34j0cs,Grizzly_Storm,1 point,Fri May 1 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you keep going on. It should act as a decent filler for P5, which I assume is what you are aiming for. Its better, streamlined than the PS2 version, has a lot more sleeker UI, more Personae, more bosses, more content (in a different way than what FES adds) etc.  As a reference point, FES is the definite version to play. Since you are coming from a P4 background, I would recommend you to continue your play in P3P, then decide if its worth your time to invest more into this side of the Persona series and directly play the 'The Answer' after story arc added in FES. And to complete it off, play it again with the Female Perspective."
Persona5,34j0cs,haunted_ninja,1 point,Fri May 1 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"I first played P3P, which might be why I feel it is the best version of the bunch. Personally, I feel like the visual novel feel of the PSP version suits Persona 3 more than the PS2 version. That aside, you'll have a much, much better time transitioning from P4 to P3P than the original or FES. You can defend and individually control your party members actions, two things you can't do in FES or the original. Menus and places are easier to navigate in P3P.  Load times are much faster. You have a vita, so it would make most sense to get the PSP version. That way you can also play on the go :D"
Persona5,34j0cs,Cloudfall,-3,Sat May 2 05:24:59 2015 UTC,FES. if anyone says P3P ignore them.  being downvoted. FES IS the definitive version. P3P just has a girl only to make up for The Answer being cut and loads of other content gets cut too but I do like Yukiko and Margaret being added to it  P3P is only for replays. just get used to tactics in FES.

Persona5,34fy3x,jamesjoyce1882,9,Thu Apr 30 20:37:09 2015 UTC,I think PS4 version will be 1080p 60fps with antialiasing and better textures as always with the same content.
Persona5,34fy3x,lawgun,-9,Fri May 1 00:14:51 2015 UTC,Consoles can't run 60fps.  Edit : Sorry it doesn't

Persona5,34fy3x,Aulti,3,Sat May 2 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"Being that it was developed with PS3 in mind and later got a PS4 announcement, I doubt there will be much of a difference at all. But that's honestly fine, because a game like this doesn't need realistic graphics."
Persona5,34fy3x,CaptainGongan,5,Sat May 2 07:28:43 2015 UTC,If you think that's the case then you should watch the FFXV gameplay scenes or trailers.  FFXV was initially in development for PS3 then they later switched to PS4 stating that the PS3 would've been unable to handle the game.
Persona5,34fy3x,Aulti,3,Thu Apr 30 22:49:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it'll be that different but I want the PS4 version for remote play.
Persona5,34fy3x,fieldstudies,2,Fri May 1 20:22:25 2015 UTC,"The only thing that would convince me to get a ps4 over the ps3 would be difference in content. If they have more content like an extra dungeon, character, or really anything, I'm going for the ps4. A marginal, if any graphics difference is not enough reason for me to get the ps4. As of now, ATLUS has been quiet on anything regarding the two consoles"
Persona5,34fy3x,dualstrike98,0,Tue May 5 06:19:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is that much of a time gap between two consoles, so you won't see any extra content in PS4 compared to PS3.  The only difference would be downgraded graphics."
Persona5,34fy3x,Aulti,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"It'll run better somehow. At the very least you can multitask on the ps4 a lot better, and now you can put your system to sleep and it'll keep the game where you left it."
Persona5,34fy3x,Thrashinuva,0,Fri May 1 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"There is no information on how much the versions differ, though the gameplay scenes in the latest trailer was taken from PS4 version.  And it would be kind of wrong to assume that it won't look better on PS4 since it was initially was in development for PS3, you can look FFXV for example. But in the case of P5, I personally don't think that developers will differ the two versions too much graphically as the game really isn't about the graphics and more about the story. But who knows since this the first Persona game on both the consoles."

Morgana is a particularly popular name in fantasy/mythology, and has a lot of usage. The English name for the cat will probably exactly be ""Morgana"", and any historical/mythological tie ins to the name will probably also remain and be directly translated.  Izanagi, for example, as well as Izanami, are from Japanese mythology and have at least some importance to the plot. Their story and names were directly translated, meaning largely left unfiltered. The only reasons Teddie went from Kuma to Teddie is because Teddie has a large significance to the idea of bears, and sounds better than ""Bear""."

Persona5,33ve2f,Kurodaw,2,Sun Apr 26 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"It starts off very odd.  I'll give you a quick summary. They go to an area called Tarturus, that opens at night every day during an 'invisible hour'. That's the time they defeat the shadows.  Minato is transfered to a dorm, and learns he has the power to fight them.   Similarly like in p4, you go to school (which I used to get lost in) and do social links and that sort.   The dungeon system is very different as a warning.  Once you go through the game, you end up getting a hopeless feeling."
Persona5,33ve2f,rhapsodyinawesome,2,Sun Apr 26 00:23:04 2015 UTC,All in all that sounds pretty good.  Might buy it on my vita.  The beginning of 4 confused me big time because you don't get to actually do anything for like an hour.  But so worth it.
Persona5,33ve2f,Aulti,4,Sun Apr 26 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"No, that's not a good idea. If you have a PS3, Persona 3 FES which you can get on PSN is objectively better than Persona 3 Portable. Better presentation is just the beginning of a long list of things that you'll get in FES that you won't get in P3P. P3P's female main character is great for a second playthrough if you feel like revisiting the game."

Only in 3 and 4 was it that only the MC could enter the room. The old casts could all also change their Personas freely.  They're all creepy/dark (all of SMT is like that, so you have a lot of games to play). While P4 had a clear mystery case to it, the others did all have mysterious aspects to the plot that waited to be solved. Even if P5 doesn't take the mystery route, you can be sure that you'll be intrigued."
Persona5,33ve2f,rhapsodyinawesome,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yea whatever happens in p5 will be well worth the wait. I liked the mystery of it,  suspense in games is hard for me to fall for but p4g did it."
Persona5,33ve2f,rhapsodyinawesome,2,Sun Apr 26 08:18:37 2015 UTC,"You should try mainline Shin Megami Tensei, those games are fantastic as well. Entirely different from Persona, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. They're less about the relatable characters and more about the social commentary and philosophy. No good or evil, just ideals. SMT IV on 3DS or Nocturne on PS2 (also available on PSN) are great starting points.  Don't expect social links or a light atmosphere going in. Expect fantastic, challenging gameplay and a story that will challenge your morals fundamentally, no matter what they may be."
Persona5,33ve2f,pezki,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:36:06 2015 UTC,My friend mentioned those games but he made em seem super boring.  Worth a second look though I suppose.
Persona5,33ve2f,rhapsodyinawesome,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:14:46 2015 UTC,How did said friend describe them?
Persona5,33ve2f,Aerys12,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:20:22 2015 UTC,Said it was a game where the dialogue doesn't matter and you're a samurai that fights demons. (paraphrased)
Persona5,33ve2f,Xephrey,4,Wed Apr 29 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. I could very easily write an essay about what your friend did wrong based on that single sentence. Word of advice, from me to you? When someone gives their opinion on a game, ask how far in they are.   Your friend did not get past the tutorial of SMT IV. Uninformed opinions can, in fact, be wrong. It's all good though. I'm here to tell ya about all the stuff that makes mainline SMT great. They're hard games to get into for sure, but oh my God, is it worth it.  First off, what your friend told you about SMT. Yes, in SMT4 specifically you start off as a Samurai. You descend into the depths of Naraku, slay the Minotaur and Medusa (hint: spam bufu and zan to beat these two), and discover the secret that lies at the bottom of the cavern. That is when you have cleared the first area in the game. I don't want to spoil the suprise, but what you find there is definitely going to blow you away.  SMT's demons are what all Personas are based on. Instead of your friends, you have demons. They follow the same basic principles as Personas. You fuse them together to get something new. The only real difference is that Demons are your party members rather than interchangeable skill sets. Instead of cards obtained from defeating Shadows, you get new demons by talking to them and recruiting them to your side with gifts and sweet talking. It's a really cool mechanic that deviates from the norm of steamrolling everything in your path.  Now the combat. Persona's One More! system is a simplified version of SMT's Press Turn system. The same basic principle of exploiting weaknesses for more turns and covering your own weaknesses to avoid getting rekt applies. It's a bit more complicated and a bit more strict, but it's more fun. It really requires you to think things through. Oh, and using buffs is always a good idea. Use the hell out of them. If there's ever any doubt in your mind about whether or not to use a buff, use it. They stack up to 4 times in SMT 1 through 3 (3 is just called SMT Nocturne in the west) and up to 3 times in 4. It goes the same way for debuffs, use those too. Pretty much every challenge the game can be overcome by using buffs, covering your party's weaknesses, and exploiting the enemy's weakness, once you've found out what it is on your own, because you aren't casul scum. Matador used an agility buff and he's using wind attacks? Buff your agility and debuff his, and get demons that resist/block wind. It's simple in practice, but it still makes you find the right tools for the job: a party of demons that can do those 3 things effectively.  The story itself isn't about the characters. I'm sorry. SMT IV has godawful characters. But while most games in the series and all its spinoffs have good characters, the point of mainline's characters is mostly that they are vehicles for social philosophies, and SMT IV's characters at least do a good job of that. Law and Chaos. Order and peace with little to no individuality versus constant strife but absolute individuality. Or, perhaps a balance of the two, though even that has its downfalls. What is right is up to you, but that won't be something you decide easily.  Give SMT IV a shot first. Try to at least beat Medusa and if you aren't enjoying the game after you've played for a little while after that, fine. Naraku is a bit of a drag the first time you go through it, but after that the game really picks up. I promise if you take the time to appreciate what the game has to offer, you'll love it and before you know it you'll be like me and you'll be buying more games than you can finish with no regrets because they're all fantastic."

Persona has excellent balance of good dialogues, interactive things and fighting. There are good characters. Game is really long but you don't feel tired. But I have bad feelings about Persona 5 and even don't know why. Maybe it's all about style, main character or three second role characters which look too typical. Typical guy, typical blonde girl and strange cat."

Persona5,31hcfc,iheartcock1,2,Wed Apr 8 04:58:18 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll have personas that are not so much based on mythology and rather just fiction in general.
Persona5,31hcfc,Thrashinuva,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"Here's a cool article about some of the most famous thieves in history. I think Dismas, Gestas, Prometheus, Robin Hood, Blackbeard, Dick Turpin, and François Villon would all make cool Personas. A few of them are European which would fit with Arsene.   Arsène Lupin first appeared in a French magazine in 1905, so we'll probably be seeing some other figures from that time period, whether real or from literature.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin  Fantômas and Monsieur Zenith the Albino are two gentleman thieves associated with Lupin.  http://www.comicvine.com/arsene-lupin/4005-75198/friends/  Picaresque novels first appeared in 16th century Spain, and became popular throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.    "" ... the modern picaresque begins with Lazarillo de Tormes, which was published anonymously in 1554 ... [the] protagonist, Lázaro, lives by his wits in an effort to survive and succeed in an impoverished country full of hypocrisy. As a picaro character, he is an alienated outsider, whose ability to expose and ridicule individuals compromised with society gives him a revolutionary stance. Lázaro states that the motivation for his writing is to communicate his experiences of overcoming deception, hypocrisy, and falsehood"".   Lazaro would definitly fit the themes present in P5.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel  As for possible female Personas, there's Josephine Balsamo, Anne Bonny, Irene Adler, and maybe the Wife of Bath. It's actually really hard to find picaresque literature with female protagonists.   Edit: Maybe the guy with the fox mask will have Sly Cooper as a Persona."
Persona5,31hcfc,assassassin_,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:56:24 2015 UTC,"Are you saying the personas of the main cast generally related in some way? I didn't recognise enough of them previously to observe a trend.  Arsene is a thief character from literature, perhaps we will see other thief-related characters, like robin hood or the pied piper?   Perhaps they will be related to justice (again, robin hood-esque). Alternatively, they may be drawn from literature, which gives myriad options."
Persona5,31hcfc,montywoodpeg,2,Sun Apr 5 07:44:44 2015 UTC,Arsene is a gentleman thief specifically from FRENCH literature...maybe the Personas are all going to be from that specific story...Arsene is so well advertised i doubt we will see more than 5 personas for the protagonists...maybe a part of what they mentioned of simplifying the games is that they are completely removing the fusion aspect and instead having personas unlock upon social link events?

The scene in the trailer where he appears to be a prisoner is a “mental prison,” so to speak. cat creature is mysterious, can transform, and is key to storyline. Hashino is choosing to remain quiet about why Personas are appearing as actual enemies and where the protagonist has his fights. There are reasons behind those details, though. They aren’t actual guns, but for reasons, they remain effective as weapons in combat. The protagonist’s seemingly docile nature is a profound ruse. He and his friends share common ground in having lost a place to live before.    Read more at http://gematsu.com/2015/02/persona-5-protagonist-first-persona-detailed-famitsu#Mm23y1laeGAxkZQW.99"

In terms of answering your question on what they are fighting, I think this cast might be a bunch of rouge characters fighting for justice they believe in, as Hashino has stated before. I can maybe back this up with the first 20 seconds of the trailer. Notice that its a massive casino with people openly gambling money. If none of you knew, this is actually illegal in Japan. The hero could be going around, fighting the Yakuza or something, trying to bring their own justice, in a way he and his friends see fit.   That, or they travel to different countries and are actually in Macau or Vegas. Just a theory!"
Persona5,307lid,dualstrike98,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:43:45 2015 UTC,I feel like it has to be contained somewhere in Japan due to them attending school. Perhaps they could leave Japan during the summer or even Golden Week. I too am in AP Psych and have found this series all the more interesting thanks to that experience.  Igor and the velvet room especially interest me due to the existential nature and the isolated area it is found in.
Persona5,307lid,Lynac,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Igor, I feel like the velvet room is going to play a huge role in the whole theme of blurred lines between good and evil. In p3 and p4, Igor is very welcoming to the wild card users. But in P5, the MC is clearly locked up in a prison, something that tells me Igor is not going to be the friendliest. This may tie into shadows being allies and all that jazz.  It's incredible how much we learn and speculate from just 3 minutes of footage!"

Plus, in some new screenshots, it shows arsene, which has been referred to as a persona multiple times, standing alongside the mc. I think that the concept of fighting personas is interesting and different, but I don't think they will actually be ALLIES with shadows"
Persona5,307lid,dualstrike98,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely agree that Arsene is a Persona, and that you'll be using/fusing Personae to fight, but what is the relationship between a shadow and a Persona? I think that they're the same being. So while we'll be seeing Arsene, I think we'll also be seeing him in his shadow form outside of battles. But who knows, it is just a wacky theory lol"
Persona5,307lid,dualstrike98,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah that definitely does have some merit. I can't wait to see how they will blur the lines between good and evil, when sharply contrasted to p4 where you knew you were pure good, and the opposition was cold-blooded evil"
Persona5,307lid,yugimon8,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:44:30 2015 UTC,That would be a cool relationship throughout the games.  in P3 you were fighting against time/enevability represented by nix who wasn't good or evil. in P4 you were the good guy fighting against an evil murder. then in P5 could blur the lines between good and evil.
Persona5,307lid,dualstrike98,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Even though persona was more fighting against a deity who only granted what humanity wanted, kind of like nyx, it still had that clear defined line of good and evil. The mc for persona 5 definitely has a more defined character, being a theif and mischievous and all that, so it would be very interesting to see a blurring of that line. If they pull that off well, which I'm confident they will, it will make for one hell of a game"
Persona5,308d5j,MessiestHair,7,Wed Mar 25 08:10:37 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point of P3 entirely.  The game was depressive, gloomy, and the meager happiness was juxtaposed to the dark themes of mortality and death. The characters were made to seem outwardly happy for a few possible reasons and it's up to your interpretation. I personally believe that even though these kids have totally fucked lives, they put on heir strong faces for the good of others, as that is the Jungian view of it.  The happiness of society during their final year is supposed to further pound in the extreme contrast between who you could be and who you are. It's made to inspire the player to think about who they are, and what they would do in the given situation.  If murder, suicide, abusive parents, broken homes, hateful relationships, sacrifice, the loss of loved ones, a society that has no time for the issues you face, having to continually hide your issues and refrain from actually dealing with your problems and the impending and seemingly unstoppable end of life entirely seems too happy for you, what the hell is wrong with you?"
Persona5,308d5j,OBMSIA,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:00:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to say it was absolutely happy, it's just that the happy bits of it is what most ''Older Persona fans'' think it's all about, they think P3 and P4 are ''weeb'' games.  I do know that P3 is sad, specially when you replay it and try to get the story together  This also didn't answer my question :c I just wanted to ask why all fans are blabbering that P5 will be like P1 and P2"
Persona5,308d5j,AFlawAmended,3,Thu Mar 26 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly there are way too many gloomy/sad games out there. they all want to be dark and edgy, and by doing that they are just identical and mundane. Who cares if P5 is happy? We need some happy M rated games. Look at all the M games out there, there all dark, broody, cynical, depress-a-thons. When I sit down to play a video game I don't want to leave it feeling worse than when I started. Yeah, P3/4 had dark and depressing parts but the contrast to actual happiness makes it have all the more impact and be so much more entertaining.  I've played P1 and P2, honestly I didn't think they were all that great. But this was after I played P4 then P3, yeah I went backwards. If that means I'm a P3 or P4 f* then whatever. Go play the hundredth carbon copy, sorry I mean sequel, of CoD or Battlefield or their hundreds of inbred cousins and be as mopey and gloomy as you want. I'm gonna go play P4 and smile some.  Sorry for the rant."
Persona5,308d5j,Marwgofuckyourself,2,Thu Mar 26 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"Wait, P3 faggot? insulting somebody because they enjoy something is the lowest any human can go...Just like whatever you like and don't let anyone tell you why you should not like something...regarding your question, P5 will never be like the 'Original Persona' The reason why they changed the mechanics was because they were simply flawed. The only logical trajectory for progress is upwards."
Persona5,308d5j,SuburbanHell,2,Wed Mar 25 08:32:39 2015 UTC,"Much like your children are all different, P1, P2, P3, and P4 each have their great unique qualities.  I've never hated a single one of them, and I'm not so sure I've seen people shit on any of them?    For me, ""Revelations"" brought me to love the franchise in the mid 90s and I've been hooked on every single game since.  You can't believe how psyched I was when they announced P3 because I thought Persona as a franchise was dead at that point.  P3 was not ""happy"" at all, hell in order to summon your Personas you had to shoot yourselves in the head.  P4 was not ""happy"" either, people were being kidnapped and murdered.  Each game has had a dark tone, and each game has been about the relationships the team builds along the way to solve all the weird shit going on in the main plot.    Sure, P3 & P4 were ""modernized"" in that building social links became a main component of the game, but if you weren't walking around each room talking to everyone multiple times in P1 and P2 you missed a lot of dialogue in the earlier RPGs, so I feel like the framework for that was there, you just didn't directly ""level up"" from say talking to Mark (Masao) in every room.  P5 will never be like P1.  It will be more like P4 with whatever new mechanics the team felt they could add to continue to evolve the franchise, as any good franchise does.  At least we can use guns again?"

Persona5,2zke9l,SCO_1,2,Thu Mar 19 08:30:16 2015 UTC,"Probably not... unless the villain had a Persona, or one of the heroes uses Lucifer as their Ultimate...  Lucifer is a largely benevolent demon in the SMT series and has the best hopes for humanity out of all the demons... but since he's also the head of the Chaos faction he is just as destructive and dangerous as YHWH of the Law faction. For Lucifer to get directly involved as something other than a basic Persona means going into the territory of the main SMT games and apocalyptic events are already reserved for the Big N from 2."
Persona5,2zke9l,res30stupid,1 point,Thu Mar 19 09:23:21 2015 UTC,"From p3 to p4 they split Lucifer up.  In p4, Lucifer is demonic in appearance and abilities, while the old Lucifer's appearance and abilities moved onto a new persona named Helel. Now you'd normally think that was pretty lame, that they just shafted this beautiful man into a terrible fate, but in reality Helel is actually Lucifer's original name. Hebrew = Helel; Latin = Lucifer (Hebrew came first, the old christian testament was based largely on the Hebrew bible, and Lucifer was drawn straight from it, just translated). Lucifer's old Almighty attack spell (which is now Helel's), Morning Star, is in reference to the origin of Lucifer, which was named after Venus, which was called the morning star at the time (because you could see it in the morning, so clever).  What Atlus has done here is they've split both the original and new interpretations of the subject, and I think they'll continue this in P5. I doubt both will ever be important to the story in one game, unless Helel physically transforms into Lucifer by means of plot events, but if one were to appear in the game to guide you, I would guess it would be Helel, who would follow a more Justice form of logic.  That said Lucifer was on your side in the original Megami Tensei game, afaik, but of course back then they were considering him to be what they now call Helel."
Persona5,2zke9l,Thrashinuva,2,Fri Mar 20 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"I know all about that (i also played SMT I, II and strange journey) that's why i mentioned it. I'm more interested in if the game, considering its theme of rebellion will finally bring back SMT factions into the story, besides the traditional sob story that persona games tend to be. I wouldn't mind a concept that starts as a irresponsible (even somewhat callous / neutral evil) group of robbers that gets into a larger story and then has to choose a side. It would be a nice shakeup after the self-sacrificing heroes for friendship of P2, P3 and (somewhat) P4. Both P3/P3P heroes are practically Jesus++ even, never mind Tatsuya Suou (Moses) and Maya (her own category, let's positive thinking!). It's time that Pilates gets a turn or someone like that.  But then i remember that P2 had no success worth speaking of and P4 was a hit (somewhat) and i'm wondering if Atlus has the balls to do it. God knows they didn't abandon the irksome highschool setting. If they upped the setting to college or something they could do things like a social link girl that's 'easy' to sex up but that doing so prevents social link progression - and even make you feel bad - because it's just 'friends' with benefits, which would confuse the players nicely by inverting their pathetic waifu conditioning.  At least it's obvious it will not be like P4. Persona is supposed to be sad damnit."
Persona5,2zke9l,Thrashinuva,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see why Persona needs to be sad. I like when they draw the story closer to the meaning of the name of the game ""persona"". Persona 4 was all about split personalities and cheerful veils masking a sinister or depressing core, it was all about peoples ""masks"", and I think that's what people liked, and why they liked Social Links, because each and every character had some depth to them, their own story, feelings, and goals, they felt human. Persona 3 was lacking in this, at least before FES anyways. The main characters had some of it but the world outside the plot had a void. They tried to improve it in FES and they really did, but it didn't fill the void completely, which other than this P3 was an outstanding game.  They've stated already that P5MC and friends are going to practically be forced into becoming thiefs, though they haven't said what that force is. It could be a powerful organization, or Igor... or something else, it could even simply be a compelling force such as saving the city. The theme is more about doing things they've always wanted to do, without worrying about the repercussions of society, so in that sense you're less ""Jesus""-ey than P3 and P4 MC's.  Also just remember P4's Devil social link... Yu wasn't exactly innocent!"

I'd even go as far as saying the story of Lucifer was inspired or drawn from Prometheus, but they still are two different mythologies and that makes them two different characters. I wouldn't mind of they added that in the game anyways, since the games don't need to be faithful to anything.  They're also really only similar in the current concept of Lucifer. Now he's known as the devil who gave humans the knowledge they have now, which is similar to Prometheus who stole fire from heaven and gave it to humans (perhaps metaphorically). But the old Lucifer (which is what Helel is based on) had nothing like that, and merely attempted to overthrow God (and before then he wasn't even a living being)."
Persona5,2zke9l,Thrashinuva,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"Phosphorus is the literal Lucifer, while Prometheus is the Conceptual Lucifer. Here is how they connect though, Christianity made all of them into one character ""Satan"". Satan also has ""stolen"" an aspect of Shiva, the ability to disguise itself as what you want him to appear as(whether you imagine him as a mentor, a friend or a lover, he can be male or female)."
Persona5,2zke9l,SanguineCretus,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"Here's where we seem to disagree:  While I consider Christianity and Lucifer to be largely based off of Greek Mythology and Prometheus, I still consider them separate entities.

Persona5,2x7pzd,Double_X_Helix,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"Not really, you don't have to grind as much as in kuni or FF13 and if you find that you aren't too used to the game play just have your first run be on the easier duffculties and if it is too hard make it harder, it is an RPG with visual novel elements but the game play and story are both great entertainment"

According to Crossmaps, Persona 5 will launch in Spring 2015 for the PS3 and PS4 consoles, however, Product Review.net allegedly claimed that Atlus might announce the game's release date at the Electronic Entertainment Expo this year.   http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/75855/20150225/persona-5-release-date-ps4.htm  Edit: Did some more research and yes, my info is incorrect.

Persona5,2x7pzd,chies_is_the_man,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:58:48 2015 UTC,I don't think so since there releasing a disc including gameplay footage with the first copies of Persona 4 Dancing All Night which releases in Japan really close to the time E3 is happening and I really doubt they'd have two new trailers revealed around the same time. If Atlus is at E3 they'll  probably just show an English version of the newest Persona 5 trailer.

And you also see him get thrown into the billboard at the end of the trailer. I think the mask person is just the cat that you see throughout the trailer.

Persona5,2vzcwa,Lynac,4,Sun Feb 15 16:52:12 2015 UTC,In persona 3 your friends said you just simply stood there and stared at nothing for a bit. I don't think anyone in persona 4 ever said anything about you and the velvet room.
Persona5,2vzcwa,hardshocker,2,Sun Feb 15 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, so in P3 they just walks to a corner and and stares at a wall for a while. This doesn't scare the people that they are literally leading into battle?  Edit: Grammar"
Persona5,2vzcwa,hardshocker,2,Sun Feb 15 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"Well Junpei makes a quick joke about it but they never mention it again through the whole game. They don't learn about the velvet room until The Answer, but that's at the end."
Persona5,2vzcwa,hmohamed11214,3,Mon Feb 16 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"I am more interested in how it looks like when a person who was already in the VR leaves it. For example, do Marie/Margret/Elizabeth just appear or do they walk out of what appears to be a normal door for a moment in time? Because for Igor and friends velvet room is a very real thing, unlike for the protagonist who just enters it with his mind."
Persona5,2vzcwa,CrackLawliet,2,Sun Feb 15 19:29:17 2015 UTC,Doesn't time stop when you enter the Velvet Room? So basically it'd be like walking to the corner and then walking wherever else (or standing there if you decide you just want to stand there).
Persona5,2vzcwa,Bvrake,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:47:16 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. In P4 the protagonist occasionally enters the Velvet Room when he is asleep. It appears he enters it as soon as he falls asleep and when he leaves it is morning. Maybe it is different when he voluntarily enters it but still.
Persona5,2vzcwa,Lgbarnecraft765,1 point,Mon Feb 16 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"In p3, Fuuka (or someone from your party) mentioned you looked a little dazed or distracted for a moment."

Persona5,2vvqj2,Skyrile,4,Sat Feb 14 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Not too much information in general. I guess from what we know now it could be something like facing the oppression of society or something along those lines.  The whole theme of slavery etc from the first teaser ties into that, people being slaves to expectations and society's own warped ideals. The whole cat-burglar-esque vibe could show some sort of rebellion against this type of thing.   The Velvet Room as a prison could represent something similar. P3 has the elevator, ascending towards the top of Tartarus as well as spoilers. P4 had the car, traveling through the fog of lies and deception to an unknown destination, so P5's meaning something is a safe bet.  Or I'm wrong, who knows."
Persona5,2vvqj2,ThatGuyfromNI,2,Sat Feb 14 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"Your interpretation is pretty spot-on, and I'd be surprised if you don't turn out to be exactly right in your assumptions.  I find it interesting that in P3 and P4, the Velvet Room could be found inside a vehicle that was taking you to your endgame destination, while in P5 it appears to do the opposite.   In Personas 1 and 2, the Velvet Room looked like a mishmash of David Lynch tropes. It looked like the interior of Twin Peaks' Black Lodge, it's an entirely Blue room with the name Velvet, full of otherworldly beings that speak enigmatically and have influence on the outside world from their supernatural lair. Those similarities aside (just wanted to point them out because I find it interesting and for one more point in a second), I do believe that the Velvet Room was referred to as a labyrinth in P1 and P2, that fits more with the ""stuck in one place"" vibe of P5 than the ""constantly heading towards a destination"" vibe of the most recent two. One thing to note -- the Black Lodge in Twin Peaks lore (back to Lynch for a second, as promised) is a seemingly unending labyrinth with an undetermined method of escape, as well. Considering that P1 and P2 could be boiled down to ""escaping the confines of one's own mind"" and ""escaping your past mistakes"", the labyrinth setup would fit somewhat.   Even if P1 and P2 don't necessarily follow that theme, I think it's safe to say that the symbolism from P3 and P4's Velvet Rooms will most likely carry on to P5, and that by fulfilling his destiny, breaking free of the Velvet Room prison will coincide with the protagonist finally breaking free of society's shackles, whether it be on a small scale, such as prison break, going on the lam, or relocating so somewhere not constrained by societal pressures, or in the larger sense, such as a revolution, coup, a high court ruling in his favor or something similar.  That was just a very long way of saying that I agree with your assessment and think it's right on the money, though none of us can really be sure until we play the game."
Persona5,2vvqj2,pmmcl,3,Wed Feb 18 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a lot of references of prison, perhaps this will be facing the consequences of one's actions?"
Persona5,2vvqj2,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Feb 14 19:16:02 2015 UTC,Perhaps it might even take it in the reverse and cover escapism? Or perhaps how to face escapism?
Persona5,2vvqj2,TastesLikeDesu,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:37:23 2015 UTC,P5 is about facing the music.
Persona5,2vvqj2,TankErdin,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm guessing that the party members are the ones who have already been ""emancipated"" while you'll probably free other people throughout the game. I think the answer to what the story is going to be about lies in how you will go about freeing these people, I think it either has something to do with the cat or the games new Cooperation function seen in the menu in the games newest gameplay trailer."

Persona5,2vg7sd,presentday_presenthr,7,Tue Feb 10 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"This is thing that happens in some JRPGs where background characters will be less detailed, such as no eyes or features. A good number of the background NPCs are very featureless, sometime even just be complete copies of each other. If you look closer at the NPC's left arm, it looks like he is raising his hand to cover his cover or wipe sweat off his forehead, but it ends in a stub of a suit jacket.  This could represent the faceless masses of the large city that Persona 5 will take place in. For example, in Persona 4, there were lots of unique character models for the background NPCs since Inaba was a small town where everyone knew everyone, but in Persona 3, which takes place in Tatsumi Port Island had less significant character models for the background NPCs since it was a city.  One last theory could be that everyone is seen through the eyes of the protagonist and if you are not significant to him, you are just a body in the way."

Persona5,2vg7sd,ukjohndoe,5,Tue Feb 10 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"They say the eyes are the window to the soul and that reflects on the design of heroes, villains and background characters. A character with concealed eyes is often seen as mysterious and a character with exposed big eyes can be innocent or display a certain emotion, anger, sadness, it's all in the eyes.   No eyes probably relates to the feeling of the crowd, isolation within yourself despite being in a train full of people, they have no distinctive character, no personality. They're just...the people.  Probably a way to get you to focus on other parts of the screen. Basically the game telling you ""this is background and non-important, you're missing the good stuff, turn to the main character!""  A lot of manga does this (although it's also because of the drawing efforts) by saying ""these are non-important, non-detailed background characters, not the focus of the scene"".  I bet we'll see these eyeless people everywhere, schoolgirls whispering, passerby salarymen, tertiary characters in mini-quests. In the anime cutscenes though, it'd be lazy to not give them eyes."
Persona5,2vg7sd,CaptainGongan,2,Tue Feb 10 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"This explanation makes the most sense. I guess I was hoping for some kind of a relationship between the eyeless people and the masks the protagonists wear, but the anime/manga idea of using the eyes (or lack of eyes) to convey emotion (or lack of emotion) is probably right. Thanks!"
Persona5,2vg7sd,ArtemisDimikaelo,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well thank you, it's just my opinion, until we hear more about the game your theory is as valid as mine. It's probably both even.  Those masks are very intriguing, I agree with you on that. They distinctly make the main characters' eyes pop in comparison to the eyeless crowd."
Persona5,2vg7sd,Thrashinuva,2,Wed Feb 11 15:21:06 2015 UTC,I always thought leaving faces of the unimportant people off was a cool stylistic choice.
Persona5,2vc89b,OBMSIA,6,Mon Feb 9 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Chair-kun's shyguy ruse seems to be his mask that he wears to deal with day to day life, his persona. his true self seen by his demonic grins seems to be reckless and prideful. Like he enjoys stealing for the thrill of stealing, and he has no real reason for doing it other than being known as the best damn thief there ever was.  With that being said Arsene is a gentleman thief and chair-kun may change and find out that their is more to life than satisfying his own pride. he may start to steal and do stuff to help others, to free them of their own chains and shackles. that's how i see it anyway"
Persona5,2vc89b,Tiggy69,2,Mon Feb 9 22:12:22 2015 UTC,I like that idea of growth
Persona5,2vc89b,dualstrike98,4,Mon Feb 9 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"I love this idea. The old persona games were very clear on who was good and who was evil, but the fact that this calm demeanor is a ""ruse"" gets me really excited for the possibilities that could come about an ambiguity of character. Not knowing if what you are doing is right or not is something I could find extremely interesting and affecting a lot of my choices as I go through the game"
Persona5,2vc89b,Lynac,3,Tue Feb 10 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would kind of both love and hate to be the bad guy. Truly, I really like  doing good things, but I don't think that this game is as ethically pure as the last two games. Sure, you fight people and destroy shadows, but being a legitimate thief just to be one is a lot more steep.  If the main character's shyness and agoraphobia is truly feigned then I feel like I don't connect as much to the character (which is okay, but meh). This game is currently shrouded in questions -- and that's great because it helps gain interest in the game.  To end it here, I like your ideas, the protagonist better not be a complete Robin Hood of a guy (I want him to be relatively clean from any past events like Yu and Minato), and, well, this game looks amazing. If it is all an ethics battle then I know I will be taking the good route first, most likely. As much as some people love to be bad it just doesn't appeal as much to me. Here's hoping it isn't GTA."

Persona5,2va34j,Butthole_Jesusman,6,Mon Feb 9 07:30:49 2015 UTC,"Man, this question is formidable.  You may have to go all the way back  to the original Persona games to get at this.  In the beginning...  A deity called Philemon existed in the realm between waking and sleeping.  He exists in all people, and has the power to awaken within them the ability to use Personae.  Igor is one of Philemon's servants who resides within the Velvet Room, and he is the only one that remains in the later games.  Philemon generally has a policy of non-interference, a personal rule which he does not extend to his servants, and so through them he can exert his generically positive influence over the protagonist's path.  Igor questions the nature of his existence in his first game appearance, since he is a creation of Philemon -- a quandary with which his own attendants seem to struggle, though if he creates them just as he himself was made he allows them to operate under the guise of humanity and does not tell them of their origin.  I guess the Velvet Room is a mental space in which your misgivings or underlying issues can be addressed as if they were physically manifest -- ever played Psychonauts?  If not, Inception may be a more timely comparison."
Persona5,2va34j,skullopendraa,3,Mon Feb 9 07:54:48 2015 UTC,Isn't Philemon dead?  Not sure if that was just some fan theory.
Persona5,2va34j,googolplexbyte,5,Mon Feb 9 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Philemon is not dead, but he has not been mentioned past Persona 2. Persona 3, Persona 4, and (so far) Persona 5 have not seen anything of the actual Philemon, though we have seen a glowing blue butterfly around in the games, which suggests that his presence is still very alive. He just might not be intervening directly anymore, rather opting to communicate through the Velvet Room and the awakening of Personas."
Persona5,2va34j,ArtemisDimikaelo,2,Mon Feb 9 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, OK.   I think the theory I heard was that Igor killed Philemon and took his powers."
Persona5,2va34j,googolplexbyte,2,Mon Feb 9 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"I believe he bursts into a cloud of golden butterflies in his last in-game appearance, saying ""I will always be with you"" to the protagonist, and is implied to be present in the Persona games whenever there is a butterfly present (like the save game butterfly in P3)"
Persona5,2va34j,skullopendraa,2,Wed Feb 11 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"Most importantly, with Nyaralathotep mostly dealt with, Philemon doesn't really need to interfere with the world that much."
Persona5,2va34j,G-1BD,2,Wed Feb 11 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised to see him at all, considering that his Japanese voice actor passed away.

I really wanted to hope that the attendant could be a genderfluid kid who switched between masculine and feminine presentations by tucking their hair into their hat and swapping their eyepatch to the other eye.

Persona5,2v7xpo,Marwgofuckyourself,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:36:18 2015 UTC,"It's possible!  The other games have been set in rural anytown, so the fact that this one takes place in a city isn't necessarily an indication that it's any farther in the future.  However, while one of them clearly has a braid, the other is a bit more difficult to make out -- some speculative fanart inspired by the trailer depicts one with a braid and one with a bun?  I confess that I initially believed they were a boy and a girl, but if there both girls it's still possible that they are Elizabeth and Margaret.  And what's with those eyepatches??  (You can see them in the clip of the MC holding onto the bars and looking disheveled -- just before it zooms in, the children are standing in front of his cell like prison guards, and their eyepatches are on opposite eyes)  None of the other attendants had such a thing -- though if it's purely aesthetic (and not a strange vestigial twin thing, or weird physically-mirrored injury empathy, or coincidental symmetry) it's still possible they are other Velvet Room attendants from the past!"

Persona5,2v7xpo,CaptainGongan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"I thought Persona 3 and 4 were pretty modern too, but since they're in rural locations it may be more difficult to pinpoint the changes in technology that indicate a difference in time between the games.  That's what makes it difficult to say whether this game takes place in the past or not -- compared to the other games, that is.  Perhaps P3 and P4 take place in the far-flung future?  They did make it seem like SMT IV took place in a distant feudal past with strange technomagical relics, but surprise! -- it's actually"
Persona5,2v7xpo,CaptainGongan,2,Mon Feb 9 07:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with the whole theme of confinement, something the P5 MC could be feeling is a wholesome feeling of just being stuck in the loop. Living out life, going to school, doing the same exact thing all the time, just bored and discontent from life. One thing that could happen is that he gets together with his friends, and tries to do something out of the norm, just to break free of the feeling like he's going nowhere in life. And from there, plot develops and so on. I could definitely see how he would perceive the velvet room as a prison if that's what he feels"
Persona5,2v7xpo,Tobeatkingkoopa,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"I do like this interpretation!  He and his friends are obviously looking for some sort of outlet, if they're resorting to high-stakes supernatural vigilantism during their time off, so the supposition that they're bored with and discontent with life seems like a good one.  This representation of the Velvet Room, as something he is meant to escape (rather than a vessel that represents his life as a whole) is new for Persona games.  It would be really gratifying if the Velvet Room changed toward the end of the game to reflect the protagonist's feelings -- and if there are more Persona games to come, I can't wait to see what they'll do for the next Velvet Room."
Persona5,2v7xpo,Shrinefox,2,Mon Feb 9 04:19:58 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to see a darker game, I get an extremely playful and lighthearted vibe from P5. It reminds me of Sly in the way they portray thieves."
Persona5,2v7xpo,KingBatista,1 point,Mon Feb 9 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"The protagonists do convey a carefree attitude, and the industrial background of the trailer along with their outrageous acrobatics kind of reminded me of Jet Set Radio Future -- a game that I would be reluctant to call ""dark"" by any means.  Perhaps they use their powers to live out their wildest and most irresponsible dreams, and realize they've bitten off more than they can chew?"
Persona5,2v7xpo,Butthole_Jesusman,2,Mon Feb 9 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"It's plausible. Well, if we follow the P3/P4 trend and have two base games released in close proximity, maybe when P6 comes out in a couple years (if the trend continued) we'll have a much darker game. I dunno, I just think what P3 was doing was really cool, and it'd be neat to have another game similar to that. Not that I'm not still extremely excited for P5."

Persona5,2v72ix,dualstrike98,3,Sun Feb 8 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"During Persona 3, it's directly stated that the Kirijo group split off from the Nanjo group from which Kei Nanjo, one of the party members in the first game and the second Persona 2 game. As a result, it is speculated that Mitsuru Kirijo's grandfather founded the corporation to try and weaponise Personae."
Persona5,2v72ix,res30stupid,2,Sun Feb 8 22:26:18 2015 UTC,Oh really? Did not know that at all
Persona5,2v72ix,Marwgofuckyourself,3,Sun Feb 8 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"Since the devs said that (I'm paraphrasing) "" We are making the game easy for newcomers so it appeals to a larger audience without isolating the existing fanbase"". They could be taking the complicated persona fusion system and just having you battle personas and harness their attacks. You keep your persona, just gain new abilities. That could also be the reason why The MCs persona is on the poster now. He could potentially be permanent."
Persona5,2v72ix,PlatinumRavioli,2,Mon Feb 9 07:48:45 2015 UTC,"In P1 and P2, shadows were not a concept yet. The Wild Card did not exist so you could only use your Persona and recruited demons, which you also fought. The demons became personae, and shadows became the new enemy from P3 onward. All of the SMT games have demons/personae as enemies."
Persona5,2v72ix,Clarkarius,3,Sun Feb 8 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, in Persona 2 you are tasked with defeating the shadows of your party members as a way of unlocking their ultimate persona. However in this case their ability to wield their persona was not influenced by them beating their shadow, but it granted them greater mastery. This would suggest the following.  1) Demons are separate to both persona and shadows, one being a spectral entity while the other is an extension of a persons subconsciousness/psyche.  2) Defeating your shadow, or atleast becoming more at peace with yourself and your inner demons, allows one to have a greater mastery over their own persona, but it is not essential to summoning one. In P1 and P2 beating your shadow grants you a stronger persona, and in Persona 3 and Persona 4, a party members persona gets stronger as the user becomes more at peace with who they are.   To support this in Persona 4, the Inaba gang are able to summon their own personas without the use of an aid, presumably because each of them has already accepted their shadow. Unlike in Persona 3, where the S.E.E.Ds use evokers as a way to forcefully summon their personas (none of which have had to face their own shadow). With both groups attaining their ultimate personas through the same means of reaching an epiphany or a state of catharsis.  3) The Wild card ability allows someone with the fool arcana to possess multiple personas (in addition to a primary or personal persona), that are an extension of themselves, allowing for greater mastery and increased potential. These personas are not demons but manifestations of their subconscious shaped by the bonds they have with others.  4) Forming a pact with a demon can be used as an alternative to summoning your own unique persona, if your own persona is either not up to the task like in P1 or P2, or the person in question is able to interact with demons but otherwise lacks the ability to summon their own persona. In this sense the demon acts as a persona, but is still separate to the individual acting as a pact our an agreement made between the individual and the demon. And as such these demons are able to rebel against and hold preferences over what type of partners they would rather work or side with. As opposed to the weaponised incarnation of the subconscious that is a persons own persona.  This is the only way I can think to justify how shadows and demons can coexist within the same universe in the persona series."
Persona5,2v72ix,Clarkarius,2,Sun Feb 8 17:32:58 2015 UTC,Ah okay I see. P1/P2 was a lot more complicated than the other games. I think it would be interesting to see this mechanic introduced back into P5
Persona5,2v72ix,darkhalo47,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Ah okay I see. And this negotiation thing, I assume that was a tactic you could use to fight demons in tandem with actual fighting?"
Persona5,2v72ix,Butthole_Jesusman,1 point,Sun Feb 8 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, rather then fighting you could instead opt to negotiate with a demon, which depending on their temperament, how well they align to the person talking to them, could lead to a series of different outcomes. From the demon reacting negatively either becoming enranged or fearful of the player, or positively leading to the demon helping the player by giving them a free item or allowing them to go on their way without inteference."

I'm also not sure it's an entirely heist style game like everyone else.  It seems the gang is attacking the casino place in this trailer on 4/11, but what if it goes bad and this mission sets up the main bad guy?  I just have a hard time thinking the whole story of the game is that these high school kids are expert heist artists, I think they cross someone at this casino and it sets the full game in motion.  Maybe you will be doing heists against the main baddies, but I definitely think there's more to this than what we see, and I don't think it's a game full of casino/bank/whatever robberies."

Persona5,2v1vsy,res30stupid,2,Sat Feb 7 16:57:54 2015 UTC,I think we've yet to see several important characters. It'd be very simplistic to only have three people to fight alongside you. This would remove the strategy of picking party members depending on the circumstance.
Persona5,2v1vsy,CaptainGongan,1 point,Sat Feb 7 23:01:28 2015 UTC,Or maybe they'll use the Aux. Persona system from Q - a base Persona specific to that party member + another Persona of the Player's choosing for stats and skills.
Persona5,2v1vsy,res30stupid,2,Sat Feb 7 23:41:48 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible, but I really hope they don't. I don't want a spinoff to become the new formula for a base game."
Persona5,2v1vsy,CaptainGongan,1 point,Sun Feb 8 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"Well... how about this?  The game will go back to the system from Persona 1/2 where everyone can use multiple Personae. However, you have to share your Personae among Party members, and this includes their default Personae (If you can have 8 max, you must use the starting Personae for each character, but they are a bit more versatile). However, each PM would have an Arcana Synch that tests how well they can use certain Personae.  Take Anzu, for example. If she were of the Moon Arcana, she'd synch with Moon Personae and receive a power boost by equipping them but she'd take a nerf if she'd try to equip, say, the Devil Arcana or be unable to use those Personae at all."
Persona5,2v1vsy,res30stupid,2,Sun Feb 8 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"That would solve the lack of main characters, I suppose. Still, there's gotta be at least one other, because we don't have a navigator, right?"
Persona5,2v1vsy,CaptainGongan,1 point,Sun Feb 8 00:19:38 2015 UTC,There's one more thief from the trailer with a Fox/Kabuki motif. After Phantom and before Skulls.

Persona5,2v0x31,ArtemisDimikaelo,4,Fri Feb 6 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"Also, the main character's mask for when he's out in the field/dungeon crawling is modeled after birds, which is what Shax is meant to be."

Persona5,2uy6zm,itsTomato,6,Fri Feb 6 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"First off, I think in P4, social links were named differently in Japan, so cooperation could be another name for social links. Additionaly, maybe cooperation is a sort of enhanced form of S. Links, maybe with multiplayer aspects involved? It's all very clouded right now, but a key component of the Person series is social links. I'm sure Atlus wouldn't take it out, and if they did, they most likely have a VERY good reason for it"
Persona5,2uy6zm,dualstrike98,3,Fri Feb 6 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"They were called Commu in the Japanese version, and the word Cooperation probably refers more to camaraderie rather than online elements."

They wouldn't outright remove them unless they had something just as good to replace them with.   The gameplay is amazing, but if we're honest, the Social Links are the money maker. Don't worry too much about it, it should be just fine."
Persona5,2uwrht,OBMSIA,4,Thu Feb 5 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"Those are some interesting ideas - I particuarly like the idea that maybe you are the evil party this time around. I get the feeling it's unlikely, but it's rare to see characters so openly revel in their Persona abilities apart from bad guys (at least in P3 and 4, I've not played 1 and 2!). I'm guessing there will be more of a Robin Hood element to it though - not necessarily ""stealing from the rich to give to the poor"", but more some kind of nobel theivery (although that doesn't stop the characters enjoying their mischief).  I'm just gonna paste some thoughts I had in a convo with a friend that I think might add something to this, let me know what you think!  Maybe in P5 Personas aren't a separate entity, but they possess your body in some way? Would explain things like the main character teleporting and being engulfed by flames when he does his persona summon, enemies you fight who have persona abilities literally become their Personas which is why you are fighting them (the guards look human - when you go into battle perhaps they ""summon"" their Personas, who take possession of them). And also the cat is shown as a normal cat then turns into that more cartoony, mascot-y one. Perhaps he is a normal cat but in Persona form he can communicate with people, like it acts as an intelligence boost - why else would he be in that form during what looks like a heist plan? (Other than to look adorable of course).  But, why would the Personas take over their hosts? A Persona essentially represents a person's ego - if someone really knows who they are, and what they want it can become a powerful self-actualisation tool (which is shown by the main character's physical abilities being enhanced, special powers, and how while he originally seemed meek on the train he seems really confident and brash while performing a heist). However, he doesn't actually visually TURN into his Persona. But there are enemies who ARE Personas, so what gives? I thought maybe it's a representation of people whose ego's are essentially out of control, like, I guess people who think they are greater than what they actually are. There's a disconnect between the actual person, and who they believe they are/what they are capable of, and this leads to the persona taking over, rather than being essentially symbiotic as in the case of the protagonists. As far as I understand, in Jungian psychology Personas and Shadows aren't necessarily good or evil. Persona 3 has shown that your Persona can go out of control if forced, so it might be related.  Also I really hope Persona summoning animations involve masks this time around - it seems like a natural progression from tarot cards since Shadows always have masks representing what Arcana they are.  Anyway that's all for my thoughts - I've not read much of what other people think yet, so others have probably said it all before me but I thought why not try to contribute? :)"

Persona5,2uwrht,Butthole_Jesusman,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would like a game about saving P3MC, but I feel like that would draw from this game as a whole. It would become ""that persona game where you save p3mc"""
Persona5,2uwrht,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"We do already know the names of the 4 party members, at least in some form. They're from the brief menu and battle scenes where you see the names written in Japanese.  The Protagonist is apparently just named 'protagonist' in the trailer, so just like with the other two main games, he probably doesn't have a default name until a manga adaptation or something.  The short-haired blonde guy is Ryuji Sakamoto, and the girl is Ann (or Anne?) Takamaki. The cat is named Morgana."

Persona5,2uwrht,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Feb 5 23:44:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, well... um, I'm not even close to being fluent in the language though! I did double check what I thought I read from the trailer with Wikipedia, the Persona wiki, and Kotaku's trailer analysis, and they all seem to agree on the names so I think those are pretty close."
