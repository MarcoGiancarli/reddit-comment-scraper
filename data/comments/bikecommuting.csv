A few weeks ago she was grabbed by douches... today, she was bitching at a BUS that clipped her, driving her off the road. Thank god there happened to be an entry to a parking lot, and not a curb. She's  You would think that a goddamn bus (you know... someone who drives for a living) would know traffic laws (3 feet if there's 1 lane, move over if there's more) and not... you know, give a slight horn beep and than barrel a hundred ton wall of death 2 feet from the curb.

However, I've heard that the bikes are still stolen from the cage. Note that this one is monitored as well.  So, caged or not caged, good bike lock is a must.  At my office, I lock mine to a bike rack in the garage. Fortunately, there are lot more better looking bikes than mine so I'm not too worried. Some use a carbon frame bike for commute, and others are cool lookin' single speed, etc.  Talk to the facility manager/HR dept./property owner at your office about your concern.  If your commute is short, one option is to buy a folding bike and just bring it in the office."

I grew up there but live in Seattle now. Visited my dad last summer there and didn't see a single bike lane anywhere around his house. He lives near 51st and Memorial.  I'm lucky enough to work in the Russell Investment Center building in Seattle, which has excellent bike rooms. There are 3 separate key card secured rooms, one of which is a fully enclosed room with no windows, the others are those bike cages that someone could potentially climb over, but they're in full view of a security desk, which I think is always manned during business hours. I've accidentally forgotten to lock my bike in there once or twice, was still there when I got back. I leave lights on the bike, they don't get stolen. I take my Garmin Edge 510 computer with me, though. Too risky leaving that on the bike."

Some of those factors effect efficiency as well. As for the relaxed position, it is less aerodynamic. You riding with your seat level with the bars isn't even that aggressive. Imagine if you went a size or two smaller and rode like the pros? :)"

It's not super quick, but I much prefer the style because it suits my biking style - calm, looking around, enjoying the day.   I considered a hybrid/mixte, but the low step is also really comfortable for me. Plus it looks classy :)"
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,axia_asia,5,Tue Jul 21 15:54:50 2015 UTC,I ride a steel touring bike - I like the slightly relaxed geometry which is comfortable for longer rides.

Despite the extra weight, the Surly is a bit faster due to aerodynamics.  I'll soon be increasing my commute from 3.5 to 10 miles, and I'm sure the more aerodynamic positioning will be nice."
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,falcongsr,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"My twin.   I just went from a Trek 7200FX (2005 model) to a LHT (rim brakes). My commute went from under 5 miles to 9 miles each way.   You did good choosing the disc trucker. The cantilever brakes on the LHT are too finicky to set up, and coming from the v-brakes on the hybrid, they're frankly disappointing.  I'm kind of wishing I got the Cross Check, which has the v-brakes and slightly more aggressive riding position.  I'll probably put the Cross Check v-brakes and brake levers on the LHT someday when I change out the bars for something a little more ergonomic."
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,flyrad,3,Tue Jul 21 19:16:18 2015 UTC,have you looked at getting short linear brakes?
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,falcongsr,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:31 2015 UTC,No! I haven't. They look like a good option that doesn't require replacing my road levers. Thanks!
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,ilipah,3,Tue Jul 21 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"I used to commute 6 miles one way on a moutnain bike which had a more upright position. Went to a CX bike when my commute became 12 miles one way. CX bike is noticeably faster - no suspension, skinnier tires, drop bars and  geometry increased aerodynamic efficiency, better gearing for road riding."
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,BeckanneSays,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"I have an Electra Townie, which rides in an upright position. I really love it, but my commute is very leisurely (about 3/4 of a mile, there is a hill but it's not huge or anything).   Also, as someone who is significantly overweight, I feel really uncomfortable in the hunched over posture. I have an old Schwinn I plan on keeping around. When I ride it, I definitely have to hunch over more. Once I lose weight, I might fix this up and ride to areas of town that are more hilly. But for now my Townie works just fine for me :)"
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,suddensapling,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"commute: 6.5k/4miles each way, some uphill & downhill both ways.    I started out commuting on a ladies' stiff framed mountain bike with a fairly upright position.  It's still my primary grocery getter and rainy day bike, mostly because I worry about it less when leaving it locked up while shopping, etc.  It's also nice to have such a wide view of the road, and it's super easy to brake on a dime when hitting an intersection at the bottom of a hill.  It's also good for days when I'm wearing a dress.    Just this past month I've started primarily commuting on an 80's diamond frame touring bike.  I ride with the saddle level or perhaps a mm below the handlebars.  Even though the gearing is roughly equivalent to what I have on the mtb, it's much more efficient and I find climbing hills on it more pleasurable.  I don't necessarily go much faster, but I can take it easier and arrive at work less sweaty in the same amount of time.  It knifes through headwinds much more easily and it's just a lot of fun to ride.  Because it's a touring bike, it still has a rack for panniers, fenders, etc, but it's a higher quality steel with thinner (though still wide at x32) tires so it's actually a fair bit lighter than the mtb.    I tested out a lighter road bike for a week but found it too aggressive to be comfortable, and having foot retention made me a bit anxious.  The relaxed stretch on the touring bike with mks sylvan touring pedals is more my style."
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,JingJang,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:52 2015 UTC,I haven't seen this mentioned here so I'll contribute:  My next commuter is going to be more upright - and probably a step-through frame.  I've been commuting for about 17 years now and as I age my wrists don't enjoy the hunched over position so less weight on the hands will help (drop bars don't seem to help).  I like the step through's just from a flexibility standpoint. Its much easier stepping through versus stepping over.
bikecommuting,3e2x2u,fdtc_skolar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:23 2015 UTC,I ride one of several road bikes for my commute. Its far suburb/rural so not much need to sit up and look around.  I have a flat bar bike that almost never gets ridden (one of my projects is to convert it back to drop bars).
bikecommuting,3e2ltl,carbontae,21,Tue Jul 21 14:00:41 2015 UTC,"I never leave without a tire pump, patch kit, and a multi-tool. Depending on your bike and how long your commute is, you might want to have some master-links for your chain if it breaks."

Rarely will you find yourself far from a bike shop or a subway stop.   So really all you need is a metrocard and a credit card plus your bike.  It all depends what's along your route, how far you travel off the beaten path. I go across randall's island to work and once skidded coming down off the bridge fast to avoid hitting someone that surprised me by suddenly crossing the path. I when right though an older tire and put a massive hole in my tube. Unpatchable, even if I replaced the tube it would've hernia'd through the skid in the tire so I was stranded about 3 miles from the nearest subway stop and it was 7am on a saturday. Bike shops mostly open around 10am. I ended up about an hour later to work after walking my bike across into harlem to 110th street.   To help best prevent getting stranded like that I keep the following in my kit;  Small pump, two tubes, patch kit, multi-tool (bike specific), a tire lever, rubber gloves. I also keep up on bike maintenance making sure to catch problems before they hit. I can't help broken glass but I can keep my chain clean and fresh, make sure everything is lubed, keep bolts tight."

I had a chain snap a couple of years later so now I carry a multitool with a chain breaker and a couple of master links.  About a year ago I crashed and broke my rear derailleur hanger, and because I was equipped I could detach the rear derailleur, shorten the chain and cycle home as if it were a single speed. Now I carry a couple of small cable ties so should it happen again I can more easily stop the loose cable flapping about.  I carry the spray on plaster etc because I got horrific road rash during that last crash and still had a fair bit to go.  I'd carry all these things regardless of distance; they're light and fit into a small saddle bag, there is no down side.

That's dry rot, and essentially means the tire has lost its flexibility. The bulge is where weight or pressure from the tube has flexed the tire beyond what it can now deal with. Like a tear in a shirt or a crack in glass, it's prone to spreading. With a bicycle wheel you're at risk of a serious crash due to the sudden loss of control when it spreads enough that the wheel can't do its job.  Go get new tires. Replace both if you can afford to so that you have even wear and that neither is near death."

About 1 1/2 km from my childhood home was a lake we always went swimming to. When I came back to my bike, I saw someone with a can of ice spray cowered over my bike's lock. I said ""Wait, I can help you, I got the key"". He stopped, looked, took a whole 10 seconds to realize the implications of what I had said and ran away.

bikecommuting,3e1pov,gerusz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:32:34 2015 UTC,I know but for it to work most of the metal needs to be cool enough  and metal has quite high thermal resistance which means it would take a while to cool it down enough

bikecommuting,3e1pov,awesometographer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"People broke into the garden of the student house I lived in in Maastricht while I was spending X-mas in Hungary. Stole my MTB, I had to buy a new bike. The dumbfucks didn't realize that the bike is rare even in Hungary (Hungarian brand, and this model is no longer manufactured; it's 14 years old or so) and unique in the Netherlands. Found it in the parking lot of the local supermarket, locked it down with the secondary lock I carried on my ""new"" commuter, called the cops, got it returned to me. (It wasn't the burglars who were riding it.) After that, I started keeping it in my basement. House got burglarized, they took the same bike again. Posted pictures of it to the Maastricht stolen bikes group, some guy who bought it off a junkie wrote a couple of days later. He was nice enough to give it back, didn't even want a reward (I still gave him a six-pack of Duvel, because behavior like that should be encouraged). This happened a couple of weeks ago. I had to buy a third bike for unrelated reasons (a real clunker), it was parked in the suterrain level of the staircase of my apartment building here in Rotterdam (I planned to fix it up, as I wasn't actively using it). Some workers were doing some work in the inner garden and left the front door wide open, apparently someone just walked in and stole it. I have a picture of its serial number, but it's unlikely that I'll find it; it's a fairly typical opafiets."

Well, the bike was not the primary target (the first time they completely emptied one of the studios that was reachable through the garden, the second time they raided through the kitchen and the bathroom cabinets, probably looking for prescription drugs) but unfortunately that bike looks a lot more valuable than it is. But statistically with a much higher bike ownership rate it has to be more frequent than elsewhere."
bikecommuting,3e2xei,shubhamshirke69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:12 2015 UTC,wrong type of bike
bikecommuting,3e1egr,Amoney8612,10,Tue Jul 21 05:25:20 2015 UTC,40 miles/day is a lot.  40 miles per day in the summer in Phoenix is way out there.
bikecommuting,3e1egr,LockNuts,3,Tue Jul 21 06:13:00 2015 UTC,"The way I see it: 10 is okay. 15 is pushing it. 20 is asking for trouble. If I had no other choice I would consider it, but I may be tempted to get an ebike at that point. But everyone has their own limits, those are just me."
bikecommuting,3e1egr,happy_otter,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:21 2015 UTC,"20 miles would be doable if stops were minimal, on a roadbike, with not much climbing."
bikecommuting,3e1egr,noburdennyc,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"My limit is based on time rather than distance. I'd be willing to go up to an hour, though I had a longer commute than that once that was a train+ bike combo."
bikecommuting,3e1egr,BBnet3000,2,Tue Jul 21 10:32:01 2015 UTC,If you must I'd trade that bike for a road bike. You could also just swap out the tires for more commuter friendly tires and get some extra bar ends for different positions cause 20 miles will wear you out.  On the plus side you now get to eat 2 extra hamburgers a day.
bikecommuting,3e1egr,palthainon,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:24 2015 UTC,"My commute is 31 miles a day. I could do 40, but I wouldn't say I'd be thrilled about it. It takes me a bit over an hour each way, so I'd guess 20 single way would take me an hour and a half tops, closer to an hour twenty. It takes a while to get fit enough to do this, close to 3 months on my hybrid before I wasn't destroyed when I got home.   My advice, get a good road bike. I have the defy advanced 2, and it's been great. The defy geometry is more relaxed while still being good enough to push through on windy days.   I commuted for a year on a hybrid and it's doable, but the defy is faster and requires much less effort judging by my overall energy levels."

bikecommuting,3e1egr,BFHawkeye,2,Wed Jul 22 02:59:04 2015 UTC,I'll be doing 20 miles a day for my new job. I'd definitely get some skinnier tires. Good luck!

bikecommuting,3e1egr,bosun120,2,Wed Jul 22 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on your conditioning, the hills and the surfaces. FWIW, I have commuted 24 miles each way, but I needed to take days off. If you are averaging 15 mph over 10 miles on 2"" wide tires, you were probably working pretty well, as it takes a lot of effort to go faster on tires that wide. I think you have to get new wheels to go to a 1 1/8 or 1 1/4 width - those widths will save you 10-20% depending on how fast you ride and how well you keep the tires fully inflated.   Have you ridden the new commute to see how hard it is? And are you working overtime, or working 4 long days a week? Commuting 4 out of 7 is much easier than 5 out of 7 - bike, car, train, whatever.  You may want to go in extra early during the hot part of the year to beat the heat. That will also let you ride at a more relaxed pace on the way in. You will likely need the equivalent of 2 water bottles on the way home."
bikecommuting,3e1egr,rabinabo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"Mostly road surfaces, but there's some dirt paths that I could hop on to.

Have not ridden the trip yet, but I feel like I can handle it! 4 long days; I'm sure there will be overtime at times.  I planned on leaving at least 2 hours early the first day - should give me plenty of time...and I'll have at least 64 ozs of water each way, just in case!"
bikecommuting,3e1egr,yetanothernerd,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"Get a steel single speed bike with disc brakes, like a State or Raleigh brand model. You dont need gears for commuting in Phoenix.

bikecommuting,3dzz4g,hotdogseason,10,Mon Jul 20 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"11 miles daily isn't that far really, especially if you give yourself time to go at a comfortable pace.

See what Craigslist has to offer."
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,vorpalrobot,6,Mon Jul 20 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"Yea it takes mild training, don't need to be in super shape. Biggest issue starting out is making sure the bike fits, so you don't get knee pain or hurt yourself. So long as the frame is the right size, the rest is adjustable."

That's actually interesting, I never considered that the person driving the last bus can't take the last bus!   Just get the bike you can afford, take your time and 18km will be no problem :)  About being in shape, I'll try to help you out there in advance:  You'll be exhausted for the first week or two as you get in shape. Make a point of getting lots of sleep and eating a reasonable diet. Drink enough water to stay hydrated all day long.   You'll want to start stretching after your rides to loosen up.  Your legs and lower back will probably feel the worst, I really recommend the hip flexor lunges, they feel amazing.   Your butt is going to hurt. That may be because of a poorly fitting seat, but more than likely it's because you have to harden your seat bones up a bit. This can take 2-4 weeks and it will take longer if you're a bit over weight and have chafing.   You don't need special clothing, but it's nicer to bike in sports pants that don't have bulky seams, like jeans have. Less chafing."
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,easwaran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:29 2015 UTC,The stretching advice will be immensely useful. Do you have any ideas of how to get post bike protein in?
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,PremiumGoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you have a reasonably healthy diet, you don't need to think about special diet for this amount of cycling. Be more worried about increasing hydration!   18km is approximately 400kcal per day. Some 100kcal-portioned ideas so you get the idea of how small 100kcal is:  1 pot of low fat yogourt, almonds (14 = 100kcal), a boiled egg, a small baked potato with salsa, 1 chicken drumstick, 2 tablespoons of hummus with 5 crackers...  You'll probably feel starving all the time for the first month and if you're not careful you'll gain quite a bit of weight snacking... It's a pretty common trap :)"
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,ConvertsToMetric,4,Tue Jul 21 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"Buy a used bike, from Craiglist or where ever.  IMO, the best bang for your buck is a 80s or 90s mountain bike with no suspension.  You can often find them for under $100.  Install some slick tires (might cost you another 30-50 bucks) and you will be set. For less than $200 you will have an excellent commuter bike.  11 miles will feel like a lot when you first start, but after a while it will feel like nothing"
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,abo3lian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"The distance is not that bad. The important thing is to check out what the local streets are like - are they crazy busy? (probably not if you're biking home after the last bus of the day) are they very rough with big potholes? (if so you might want something more like a mountain bike) are there good side streets that might be a little safer?  Also, if you're biking at night, you definitely need to get some lights."
bikecommuting,3dzz4g,Lavenderizer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"Check craigslist for bikes, beware you may be buying a stolen one though. $500 is a decent chunk of change but it's really a one time purchase for many many many years. 11 miles should only be difficult the first week and before you go give yourself extra time. Please get a blinker for the back and I'd advise learning how to change a flat before you need to. Personal experience on that one."

Was done in three legs over three days--with tenting at two state parks--and we were never more than ten miles from a town, so it wasn't really necessary to plan for water. We'd also done two of the legs many times and knew what to expect. Water is heavy, so you try not to overdo it.  For food, we just went out to eat. Could've brought a camping stove with dehydrated food, but were stopping at a brewery/pub anyway. Had clif bars (bought in bulk for $0.50 each) and other snacks to munch on.  We've been doing this for a few years, but still don't have much fancy gear. I carried my Arkel Commuter (24L) pannier and bungie corded a tent on the rear rack. Not too far back in my history, I think I linked to a lot of the stuff I'm using."

bikecommuting,3dwh1h,antarcticgecko,5,Mon Jul 20 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"Folding tires are much easier than steel beaded ones, but not if they're terribly stiff tires such as marathons. Between the rigid carcass and the rubber layer under the tread, those kinds of tires are able to hold a ""fold"" and be really difficult to mount. Steel beaded tires are going to be round so that's not an issue. Folding tires with fast supple carcasses and no rubber puncture layer under the tread, such as Compass tires or Grand Bois are a treat to mount. So much nicer to mount than any other tire I've ever used actually.  Don't get me wrong, Marathons are great tires with lots of advantages for touring remotely or ""can't afford a single flat ever"" commuting, but there's really no reason to get them in folding version. They're going to be terribly slow with or without the extra 100g of steel bead. The main reason they come in folding is taking spares on tours.   If you're looking for light fast tires, skip the puncture belt and rigid carcass as each are probably knocking a mph or two off your speed. Folding vs non-folding marathons aren't going to have significantly different speeds, might as well save a couple bucks, especially for commuting. Hell, if you can spare the outlay, I'd recommend getting some steel beaded replacements and keeping those folders as spares since they can fit in a bag.  Just my two cents on folding tires for commuting. Glad you had a good ride."

bikecommuting,3dvb0g,throwawayyupyeahgeez,25,Sun Jul 19 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"Without pictures it's hard to recommend a go or not go call.  However, as a person that commutes with a similar bridge situation (a 1.5 foot bike lane which is rendered almost unusable by drainage grates), I do a few things to stay safe.  1) Take the lane, especially with cars coming the other way.  There is nothing worse than having folks squeeze between you and oncoming traffic, while trying not to cross the double yellow lines.  Rear end accidents are rare, and taking the lane for that short distance forces drivers that want to pass to enter the other lane rather than arbitrarily squeezing at the line.  2) Ride fast.  Minimize your time on the bridge and hopefully get a little more slack from drivers if they come up behind you.    3) Hold a straight line.  This is good advice for pretty much any situation, but the more predictably you ride (even if it's taking the lane), the safer you will be.  Do not weave and bob around debris and bumps on the side of the bridge.  You'll learn what lines are best after a few commutes, but just be aware that crud tends to collect on the side of bridges and away from the center."

bikecommuting,3dvb0g,AT_thruhiker,20,Sun Jul 19 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know it was a two laner.  Yeah I personally would take the lane there.  It's even easier for them to pass on the left.  Many motorists do the ""squeeze"" thing without even noticing it.  This eliminates that casual risk increase.  Walking is a completely acceptable way to go if you are nervous and really a minute or two longer of a commute is a wash in the end.  The best bike commute is the one you ride the most."

People should feel comfortable biking on streets regardless of athletic ability.  It's also not always safe. A street may be designed to encourage vehicle speeds of 30mph, 45mph, or more. Obviously, most people cannot bike that fast, especially the people who we want to encourage to bike. Controlling the lane is safer in this situation, but still far from ideal; a distracted driver could fail to notice a person biking; an aggressive driver could put a person biking in danger; fast lane changes can be dangerous for obvious reasons. This can also make it difficult for a person biking to make a turn, especially if it requires cutting across several lanes.  Biking should be as easy and convenient as walking or driving is. Plain and simple."

If you don't ride in rain, then I'd take a look at something like Linus bike, but this is more or less my liking of retro chic."

bikecommuting,3dvsnl,HadouKang,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:37 2015 UTC,There isn't a whole alot of difference between the 2 bikes (FX 7.2 and Sirrus) you list.  The LBS is probably recommending the Sirrus because they deal in Specialized and not Trek.  But they're both well suited to your situation and very comparable.  Both are big brands that make alot of reliable bikes - both likely have a nice warranty.  There's really no wrong choice between the 2 for a first commuter bike.  If you don't already own them: a nice helmet and name brand u-lock to secure your fancy new ride.
bikecommuting,3dvsnl,MathiasaurusRex,2,Mon Jul 20 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for. And by name brand U-lock, do you mean like kryptonite?"

I ended up getting a Kryptonite u-lock and it's been working perfectly fine. I also got a Kryptonite cable to secure the front wheel to the frame while I use the u-lock for the rear wheel.  And ditto to /u/drabb, get a helmet. Other things that came in extremely handy were a bike multi-tool, tire patches, tire levers, and a hand pump. I happened to get a flat out of nowhere (somehow a staple got wedged into my tube) halfway to work and I was able to quickly fix it up thanks to the patches."

Nothing crazy fancy, but if you're not putting on a ton of miles and you're on relatively flat ground, there's nothing quite like a single speed. Dead simple to maintain, and if you want to go fast, you pedal fast.  Probably the closest you can get to feeling like a kid again."

bikecommuting,3dtshs,jrlemay,3,Sun Jul 19 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"SQUIRRELS ARE THE WORST. I think i figured them out in general. When they run from predators, they're used to said predator coming after them (i.e. Following in their direction) on a bike, you're taking a constant, straight line, which violates that expectation and makes them panic. So they pick a direction, start running, and then panic and turn back in the opposite direction...right under your tire. I've found that if you alter your course (WHEN POSSIBLE AND SAFE) to one side of the trail to the other i.e. ""chasing"" the squirrel, they will generally pick a direction and stick with it."

Fenders Clean your bike, at least twice a week once the roads get treated with anything Take it easy on corners"
bikecommuting,3dua7n,neilcj,3,Sun Jul 19 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone is going to do different things depending on how comfortable they are and where they bike I live in southern Ontario and we get a good mix of snow and cold, so a lot of salt on the roads. I ride with the following changes.  1) Front derailleur removed completely and rare derailleur swapped out for a cheap-o. 2) rear break removed. 3) Tires stay the same, but I let them go a little fat to improve traction.  Also, keep in mind that salt will destroy cables so be sure to have replacements ready.   As for surviving the ride, layer up and pay for good gloves, socks and facemask. The rest you can get by with decent long johns and wool layers.  when riding try to aim for a consistent speed, not necessarily fastest. Hard breaking or turning is not advised. Expect a 20% in crease in time. I do a city 5k in under 15 minuets in the summer and around 18-20 minutes in the winter.  When you start, it is bitch ass cold. But, you quickly warm up and your thoughts ""of Geez, its cold"" turn to ""I AM A WINTER GOD!""  I hope you love riding winter as much as I do."
bikecommuting,3dua7n,ofallthe,3,Sun Jul 19 16:40:10 2015 UTC,I also converted an old bike into a winter bike. Here's what I use:   Fenders (clip on if necessary depending on the bike) Schwalbe Marathon Winter tires Big knobby aluminum platform pedals  Lobster claw style gloves Balaclava  Cran   You can mitigate the damage from water and road salt by giving the bike a good wipe-down immediately after arriving at work and again when you get home.

bikecommuting,3du5cv,fdtc_skolar,6,Sun Jul 19 17:56:37 2015 UTC,if you havent done it yet i would reccomend doing your entire commute route around the time you will be doing it normally to get comfortable with the route and the traffic before you actually do it for real if you are worried about it. thats how you can get the best idea of what you are really getting into since traffic changes so often.   but really the best time to practice is any time you will get out there though. miles > no miles.
bikecommuting,3du5cv,fireflydealership,3,Sun Jul 19 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends. On some roads, it's actually easier with lots of cars, because then they're moving slowly and predictably. When traffic is low, people often speed and don't look for unexpected things (like peopl on bikes).   And if you're still getting used to riding in the road, you don't have to do vehicular lefts - you can do a two stage left by just going forwards through the intersection, pausing until the light turns, and then going the other direction (like a pedestrian).   But just do it, and try different times of day. And see if there are side streets that parallel the busy ones - even without bike lanes they're often more pleasant."

I was biking home from campus on my road bike when a young German Shepard owned by some dumbass on the sidewalk saw me.  It was ahead about 50 ft and had eyes locked on me and was in running stance. I knew my two options were to either power forward at full speed or try to reverse direction.    No fucking way I was going to be able to reverse direction so I just powered forward.  The dog starts running towards me and then peels around and does a 180 as I pass in such a beautiful parabola  that it could have been a nature documentary example on predators. I have a momentary lapse of concentration it was so stunning; I then pedaled harder and faster than I knew I possibly could and in about 5 seconds (5 extremely long seconds) it gave up chase.  I knew it was younger because it was small and a fully grown one could have easily taken me down.  Not sure what the right play would have been in that case.  By the way, I know you say you're a cat person but please don't take this as the dog's fault.  They are wonderful creatures who often have shitty owners.  You call it ""weaponized"" but that's a lack of training on the owner's part."

I have been described as a blunt asshole before, though, and I don't think it's inaccurate in certain situations.  It really is true: there are cat people and there are dog people. I find it fascinating how much I generally disagree with the worldview of cat people. ""Dog"" people, or those who can be described by the connotation, are generally resourceful and calm enough under pressure to avoid being in a situation where you're kicking a dog out from between your spokes. You acted like a chode, that's all. Maybe you were distracted listening to Bon Iver, or your scarf flew up in your face. I can't pretend to know...  If you were really attacked by a pit bull the way you say you were, you would have some serious marks and should be pressing charges. The way you describe it, everyone sat in their cars and watched as you were savagely torn to shreds by Cujo. Humans tend to exaggerate - I get it; I was exaggerating when I said that I would dropkick a cripple, haha. But tell me this - what was the beast, completely fixated on your getting a piece of your tasty flesh, doing while you verbally assaulted his owner? Nothing?  To be perfectly clear - yes, I would go over the handlebars to avoid hitting a dog. Even if it was trying to bite me. It sounds like the dog owner might be mentally ill, physically disabled, or just a fucking idiot.  But I'm not saying it makes sense to care more about the life of a dog when compared to the life of a human. The issue is that we hold humans accountable for their decisions - to expect the same of a dog isn't logical.  What you don't understand is why people are mad at you. It's not that we're butthurt over you kicking a dog. We're just suggesting that you learn how to deal with a dog running at you.

This fits your general pattern of delusionally inventing details to fit your preconceived notions and fantasies. This includes your theories about how ""cat people"" and ""dog people"" form distinct races and from which you can magically extrapolate all manner of details about a person's personality. Maybe instead of using a bunch of invented details to shrilly denounce the nameless, faceless internet person-thing who inadvertantly hurt the fluffy puppy , you should re-read my post at face value and try to realize that this is a thing that happened to a real person.

I get to work early, so I can come home early, so there was very little traffic around and no pedestrians.  Doing my normal traffic scan, I see a dog run out of a driveway about 100 feet in front of me.  This thing was huge, and as it ran out on to the sidewalk towards me, it suddenly stopped.  I jammed on my brakes, downshifting, preparing to turn around immediately and haul ass away from it.  It stared at me for a few seconds as I was stopped, we're less than 50 feet away at this point.  All of a sudden, it turns tail, and in the course of 3-4 steps it was heading full speed away from me, hitting a chain link fence as soon as it hit its stride.  Watching the dog slam into the chain link fence, its neck first bending, then its body contorting, trying to absorb the extra momentum has to have been once of the funniest things I've ever seen.  After it regrouped itself, it slinked back into the driveway it came from and went up towards the house.  I slowly peadled by, keeping an eye on it in case it changed its mind, laughing my ass off the entire time.  TL;DR: Dog and I stop and stare each other down as I prepare to turn tail and run away.  Instead, dog does the same and runs full speed into a chain link fence. I laugh."

You could also get a CO2 filler/pump combo to make the filling easier.  To avoid flats either get some decent tires with an anti-flat liner built in (Continental Gatorskins or 4 Seasons, Specialized Armadillos, Schwalbe Marathons, etc) or else some separate tire liners (Mr. Tuffy, etc) to put in the tires.

There was never any ongoing reason, it was always just glass/thorns/nails/etc etc. I got tired of it and just had my LBS replace my stock tires with Schwalbes. WORLD of difference. I've put more miles on them in the last 3 weeks than I did with my stock tires in 6 weeks. I have experienced zero flats. Not even a Schwalbe rep, but I could not recommend them highly enough."

bikecommuting,3dntv8,sensible_human,5,Sat Jul 18 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Hey! Philadelphian here. Since our city is so flat, a single speed is ideal. You can get a decent one for $200 new, even less used. It definitely makes life easier to have a light bike, especially if you'll be carrying the bike up and down stairs or on the subway.  Philly is awesome for biking and keeps getting better. Plus we have a strong, active bike community. If you're new to biking on city streets, check out the Bicycle Coalition. They hold a ton of group rides."
bikecommuting,3dntv8,He-Bear,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with single speeds in general, but something to keep in mind is that it might be nice to have mounts for fenders and a rack. I'm not sure what OP's situation is but I would be dead in the water without my rack and panniers."
bikecommuting,3dntv8,sensible_human,3,Fri Jul 17 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yes those are definitely nice to have, good point. It's not too hard to find a single speed with eyelets/mounts.  In Philadelphia though it doesn't really rain much, so fenders can be overkill especially if you'd rather just take the subway on rainy days. Racks are good but if your commute is only 2.5 miles (like most bike commutes in Philadelphia) a backpack or messenger bag can be easier."
bikecommuting,3dntv8,getjustin,2,Fri Jul 17 20:19:55 2015 UTC,Take a look at the Torker U-District. It's a solid single-speed under $300. It's easy to maintain and have a nice frame that will outlast everything on it.
bikecommuting,3dntv8,mountainsofolivs,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds great – spending less than my budget would definitely be a plus. And a light bike is preferable given my walk-up living situation. Thanks for the advice, I'll check out Bicycle Coalition for sure.   Since you're in Philly, do you know of some specific shops I should be going to? Or is the norm to buy online?"

Edit: Includes mounts for rack, and I think you could put a fender on there, but if that's a big use case for you, consider a different bike or an additional rainy-weather commuter  bike with a coaster brake and fenders."

It costs about $500-600, and I would say it is a great bang for your buck, and an excellent bike. The sportif is an endurance road bike that is for those that are commuting, riding for fitness, or looking to get into racing. Its a lot more relaxed and comfortable than traditional road bikes. There are variations of the sportif; the 2.5 is the most basic model.   Mine cost 460ish without tax because I bought an older model, as opposed to the 2015 model. Overall, it gets me where I need to be. I've put the bike under some abuse the last several weeks (pot holes, rocks, broken glass) but its held up well so far. Definitely consider it."

bikecommuting,3dkm9n,xnd714,4,Fri Jul 17 03:37:54 2015 UTC,I go the other direction but only from garneau to downtown!  Nice work taking the lane. I've done the 82st north during evening rush hour and crossing the yellowhead is always fun taking the lane too.   I've also done the little parking lot detour east of Churchill square. There's really no better way. Easier to stay away from 104ave.   Have you ever tried going down grierson hill to the pedestrian bridge over the river to Muttart and up mill creek ravine to the old timers cabin exit then up Saskatchewan drive that way? Probably easier to stay on high level bridge come to think of it.   Also why not go on east side of high level coming from say 103st to 100 ave? Too much traffic/lights?

Taking the lane just seems to be the safest option lol.  And yeah, that parking lot the fastest way I find. I use to take 104 but I realized that it was just way too backed up in the morning.   I try to avoid Grierson hill and the pedestrian bridge mainly because of the hills. I try not to get that sweaty on my commute lol.

It only increased my commute by a minute or two.  For the first few hours, I was full of energy. My mind was wandering for most of the time, about my commute home. I'm hooked. I didn't sleep enough from excitement the night before, so I blame that for my tiredness.  The only issue I had after my commute is I felt a little dehydrated (slight headache) but after taking in a ton of fluids, I'm feeling much better now.  I love driving, but I love biking more now.

bikecommuting,3diydt,_toro,3,Thu Jul 16 17:25:13 2015 UTC,Nice! This last week I've been trying to get my average speeds up. Previously they've only been 10-11mph. Which isn't terrible because my commute is only 2 miles. Now I'm keeping my averages to 13+. I've had to change my route a bit so I don't have to slow down or stop. Gonna try some different routes over the next week to see if I can find the best one.  edit: I'm hoping to have an average of 15-15.5mph before it starts snowing.

This includes a good night sleep - don't skimp.  8 hours min :) Use a stick massager on your legs Allow yourself some extra time on your commute and take your foot off the gas   There's no silver bullet here, and you're going to feel it a bit that day after a long ride, but it can be managed."
bikecommuting,3djvnz,drabbb,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Eat some protein within 10-30 minutes after a strong effort   This one's difficult. Usually, I need to cook after getting home. If I don't have some Seitan handy, I usually don't get any protein until the food is done. Though I've adopted the habit of drinking a glass of milk after rides.  I've been thinking about massages using sticks or foam rollers, but especially the latter is actually pretty expensive. Thanks for the suggestion, I think I'll pick up something along these lines.  And yeah, taking the foot of the gas is definitely a good idea. I just switch down to a lower gear/higher cadence effort, so going from 36-38 kph in the flats to about 30-32. That at least does the trick of not losing form during the week, and not getting progressively more exhausted.   There's no silver bullet here, and you're going to feel it a bit that day after a long ride, but it can be managed.   Yeah, my problem is that I can feel it the entire week, not only just the day or two after :-\"

bikecommuting,3djwny,albemuth,2,Thu Jul 16 21:33:58 2015 UTC,I had mine fixed with mesh. I have not had any problems with it. I would not worry too much about it. You will have to take some time off from the bike but in the end you should be fine.

bikecommuting,3djwny,Koulyone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"I was not commuting when it developed and was repaired. This was last year. I just started commuting about 8 weeks ago, 12 miles round trip with no problems."

Take it easy on the climbs but no need to stop cycling.   I was diagnosed, continued to commute for  an month, went on vacation for two weeks, then had the surgery.  The operation is laparoscopic with both incisions going in around your belly button. You'll be up and walking (gingerly) that day.  You'll feel like you've done 200 situps that's about the amount of pain, except sneezing, sneezing fucken kills.  You wont want to cycle for a couple of week afterwards."

bikecommuting,3df6yq,bikeruneat,4,Wed Jul 15 21:11:31 2015 UTC,"Well technically I have. I've got a convertible so when the weather is nice it's really fun and relaxing to drive. But to really have fun with it you need to take it through small, winding roads (preferably mountain roads), not the highway that connects my village with the town where I work. And even though it's fun, it never gives you a sense of achievement as in ""I'm pleased with how I drove today."" So yeah, for now I clearly prefer the biking experience..."
bikecommuting,3df6yq,bikeruneat,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:33 2015 UTC,Glad you were able to get that. I can see how a fine piece of machinery might add to the experience.
bikecommuting,3df6yq,suddensapling,9,Wed Jul 15 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"I can't believe it took me so long to see the beauty of bike commuting! I've been driving my car to work for one and a half years: A rather monotonous highway stretch of about 10 kilometres, twice every day. For some reason it felt just a tad too long to use a bike instead.  Two weeks ago I finally decided to give it a go. I bought a nice second-hand bike and did a first commute the day after. The bike route is for the largest part well maintained, entirely separate from motor traffic, and pretty idyllic. So now, instead of sitting in a car hardly moving any muscles at all, I get the whole deal: A nice workout, fresh air, a beautiful scenery. I've really been missing out!  The image shows how the route looks 80% of the way. I cross vehicle traffic for a few hundred metres in the beginning and for maybe a hundred metres at the end of the commute, other than that it's just me, countless horses, sheep, hares, deer and nature.  In the short time since I got started I cut down the one-way travel time from 40 minutes to 25 minutes already, lost a couple of pounds and feel fitter. I never knew progress was this quick!  (BTW, yes, I chose a mountain bike. I know it's not the rational choice for commuting but it's the kind of bike that I like, and that wins out for me! Who ever said bike commuting was about efficiency? :P)"
bikecommuting,3df6yq,randomusername3000,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"It's great, isn't it? :D As for the mountain bike - hey, that's what n+1 is for!  I have a stiff frame 90's mtb myself. (And if you do decide you don't want to have to pedal quite so hard, you can always swap the tires for narrower slicks and lock out the front forks.  It's amazing what a change in tires can do for speed.)"
bikecommuting,3df6yq,data-chh,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"You know the crazy thing is: I actually own a street bike. (Not sure if it qualifies as such, but it's got larger wheels and slicks.) But I just never really liked it much. If I feel I need a more efficient ride I might just take it out again, but until that time I put it in the basement and the new bike gets moved around!  Right now I feel that I don't even want to go that much faster. 25 minutes is a really comfy amount of time, it easily fits in my daily schedule but still provides enough of a workout to be beneficial in and of itself. But hey, what do I know how I'll be looking at things a couple of months down the road ;-)"
bikecommuting,3df6yq,hiyaninja,3,Wed Jul 15 20:44:12 2015 UTC,i promise you will enjoy having slick tires on your mtb if you only ride on the road.  you can still get fat tires with slicks.  knobbies are for riding offroad
bikecommuting,3df6yq,suddensapling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"When I first started bike commuting I used my hardtail Cannondale because I was comfortable on it. A $30 trip to the bike shop bought me some tires without knobs and cut over a minute off my short commute. I definitely recommend this!    I had a road bike that I was not comfortable on as well, but I dusted it off this summer and I'm hooked! Do whatever your comfortable with!   Your picture makes me regret living just 2.4k from work."

bikecommuting,3df6yq,stubmaster,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's what matters! :) Sometimes I ride my vintage touring bike which, though slower than the sportier road bikes, is much more efficient than my mountain bike. It can be fun to just pedal with ease up a steep hill without even dropping too many gears and to be able to knife right into a head wind from the drops.  On days I take the mountain bike to work instead, I appreciate the casual comfort it offers.  I'm closer to the ground and can more easily put a foot down when coming to a sudden stop; being a bit more upright is comfortable over shorter distances and affords a good view at intersections, even if I sweat a bit more grinding up the bigger climbs.  Better work-out that way. ;)"

I wouldn't say Sweden is perfect when it comes to biking, but compared with most countries it's awesome, simply due to the low amount of traffic on country roads. Don't know if separated bike paths are the norm though, in this case it was an old railway line that isn't in use anymore and instead was turned into this nice bike path."

bikecommuting,3dgmwf,RaccoonDispenser,5,Thu Jul 16 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"Good infrastructure is what makes me love commuting by bike. 100% separate from cars, so I have no worries other than the occasional driver not seeing me as they edge out of a road or driveway (we're all human, I see them in advance, slow down and smile as they freak out when they do finally see me).   If I had to commute on the road, even in a bike lane, I'd be a lot less likely to bike commute. I'm not brave.   Side benefits: I could ski on the paths in winter! Or walk as far as I'd like and catch public transport when I get tired. I get home more relaxed and am a nicer spouse for it. No gym membership (700e), no bus pass for 6 months of the year (600e), minus bike maintenance and gears (300e) and I come out about 1000e ahead of previous years costs."

I'm glad that NYC is raising awareness that you can't just fling a door open like you live in the matrix and nothing around you exists. There are stickers on the doors of cabs now encouraging people to be aware of their surroundings.
bikecommuting,3dgmwf,exFAL,-2,Sat Jul 18 14:24:22 2015 UTC,The only real fun commute and good transportation for all is an electric bike with 350-500 watt motor going 20-35mph. But cost $700-1500.  Traditional Biking $200-400 is only fun downhill.
bikecommuting,3dgmwf,He-Bear,3,Thu Jul 16 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, man. The fun in traditional biking is overcoming the challenge and traveling the streets on your own strength.

Group rides are some of the best ways to make people comfortable biking in urban areas. It's also a good way for people to learn how to anticipate danger and bike defensively.

I didn't really account on that (maybe it was too obvious for me at the time or I simply forgot). Then he tried to find a longer seat tube, so he could raise the seat to a comfortable level, but it had an unusual width and he couldn't find it. So he quit after exactly 1 commute. I feel a little bad for not giving him the best advice I could.  It was last summer.

bikecommuting,3dbfxr,Bane_and_Boon,21,Tue Jul 14 23:43:47 2015 UTC,I don't find having a second pannier makes much of a difference in balancing the load laterally. (Not as much as you think it would anyway.) Walking a loaded bike is sort of a skill unto itself and it is something that takes a bit of practice. That said I would never prioritize ease of walking in my carrying solution. It's just not something I do enough to ever be a factor. They're great for riding and that's what I do on my bike.
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,TheJulian,5,Wed Jul 15 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"After months of riding with one pannier I swapped the side and realized how asymmetric I'd been (of course swapping sides with a single pannier doubles the effect)  At the time I was carrying a laptop and lunch, 10-15lb.  Since my pannier wasn't fully waterproof I got a pair of Ortleibs (Front Rollers) and really appreciated the symmetric balance after that.  Just my experience - I did find the lopsided nature of a single panner worth avoiding."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,fantastipants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"How heavy is your bike?  I think my bike is 38 pounds without the pannier, and I have one which I put <10 pounds in it. (I also bike at like 8mph.) And I haven't noticed anything unusual about the symmetry or lack there of."

bikecommuting,3dbfxr,fantastipants,2,Wed Jul 15 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"I think it becomes more of an issue for those biking in urban areas. In major cities, you often have to walk up/down stairs, lift the bike up curbs, and walk to find a bike rack. Also, bike trips in cities tend to be short (1-2 miles or less). So the weight of the bike and ease of walking it is actually really important for urban biking.  I tried panniers, but they really weren't worth it for me. They made biking a little more comfortable, but biking is only a part of the biking experience. They made taking the bike up/down stairs, into subway stations, locking, etc. all more annoying."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,sensible_human,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:45 2015 UTC,Just to present a counter: I use panniers in an urban area (Toronto) and do all that stuff... I lift it up stairs and walk to lock-ups etc. I wouldn't be without my panniers. I have one that's old (but still waterproof) that stays on my bike permanently. If I have to make an uplanned trip to the grocery store or something I don't have to think about how I'll transport anything. I do have a second one that's a little nicer that I bring if I'm transporting my laptop or something needs to come inside with me.
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,TheJulian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah different solutions work for different people, for sure. I use a front basket since it is light and versatile in addition to a bag. More permanent than a pannier. Do you leave your empty pannier bag on your bike when you lock up?  By the way, Toronto is an awesome city. It didn't seem too bike-friendly though when I visited a couple of years ago. Have they been improving their bike infrastructure at all?"
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,sensible_human,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"I've toyed with the idea of getting a basket. Something like this perhaps. Something sturdy and a bit lower than your average handlebar basket. What does your setup look like?   I do often leave my pannier on my bike when I lock it up. My feeling is that it's kinda sun-faded and junky looking so hopefully not overly attractive to thieves and I wouldn't be too sad if it were to get stolen. I've been doing this for about 5 years and so far so good fingers crossed. I should add that I don't leave my bike locked out for whole days at a time and I don't park it in the same place regularly so that might have something to do with it. I use it to go to friends houses, the bar, run errands etc. I don't have a daily commute.  I do love Toronto but agree that it could be far better for cycling. Both for commuters and recreation. There is finally the beginnings of plans to catch us up with other cities in that regard. No huge changes yet but change is in the wind! Rob Ford was a bit of a set-back to say the least."

Makes very little difference in handling to me unless they are heavily loaded. This might be the bike, or it might be because I weight 200 pounds so the weight difference is negligible. The rack I have also has a set of lower rails that let the pannier clip on a little lower than the top of the rear wheel, which also probably helps.  When walking the bike with only one pannier on there, it helps if you walk on the side opposite the pannier."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,vhalros,6,Wed Jul 15 00:15:54 2015 UTC,It also helps to hold onto the nose of the saddle with your right hand when walking on the left side of the bike. Its a lot harder to control the bike holding on to just the handle bars if the panniers are heavy.

bikecommuting,3dbfxr,SmartToaster,4,Wed Jul 15 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"Do you clip in?  If so I recommend putting the pannier on the same side as the foot you generally unclip when you come to a stop.    For me this is the left foot.  I used to load up the right pannier because it was easy to lean the bike into me and access that pannier.  However, doing that caused me to sometimes get unbalanced as I was coming to a stop and I'd topple over because I couldn't get my right foot unclipped in time.  Moving the bulk to the left completely stopped this problem."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,grandzooby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"Weirdly, I do the opposite, since I tend to want to lean away from the pannier when I stop to counter the weight."

If have 2, put more weight on the outside pannier, it will balance much better.  Carrying the bike on your shoulder with pannier in your hand will help with stair.  Don't buy any more thing, work with what you have.   Off topic, I really hate trunk bag because it messes up my leg swing dismount."

My bike doesn't feel lopsided while riding, but I stop a lot (stores and stuff) and have narrow steps at my house that lead into an even more narrow hallway. (The bike+ panniers and I do not both fit through) It's just such a huge hassle to me, plus I've dropped my bike like 5 times because I was locking up and suddenly realized that it was less balanced than I thought it was while I was riding it."

I find it makes a huge difference not having the weight on the bike for taking the bike up/down stairs. I know a lot of people in this sub are all about putting the weight on the bike, but I think that's more of a suburban/rural commuter thing."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,mmediaman,2,Wed Jul 15 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"Is it a new bike or did you add the rack/fenders to a bike you're already familiar with?  Maybe the funky handling is not entirely the rack/fenders.  That said, if you're carrying a load strapped to your bike (e.g. a load that used to be on your back) it will feel different and it gets tippier when walking, especially if you walk it by holding the handlebar stem.  I find that pushing down a bit to give the front wheel more grip helps with that.  Best is to walk with one hand on seat, other hand on handlebar.  I carry a somewhat ridiculously heavy load.  Pannier has clothes, tools/spares and other crap I haven't bothered to remove.  Laptop bag has laptop and other crap that's accumulated.  Some days I carry groceries.  It can add up to over 50lbs.  I leave it all on the bike when I carry it up the stairs to my office.  I used to carry by grabbing the top tube nearest the seat and lifting to my shoulder.  I found a better way: grab the down tube nearest the bottom, putting your hand through the triangle and letting your fingers curl around it from the other side.  As you lift (legs not back) let the top tube rest against your upper arm.  Hold the handlebar with your other hand.  Going upstairs can be tricky cos the front tire might bump the stairs.  To help with this, angle your body a bit (yaw the bike away), pitch the bike up a bit, angle the bike OUT a bit (tires further away from body).  Doing all this I can carry my fully loaded bike up two flights of stairs without much discomfort."
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,GeorgeOwnwell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:55:14 2015 UTC,I would try a rack top bag or saddle trunk. If that doesn't do it front racks and TWO panniers are the way to go. Something like the blackburn outpost front rack is very nice and versatile.
bikecommuting,3dbfxr,Not2original,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:29:26 2015 UTC,Try a trunk bag. You aren't carrying much and some of them will expand if you make an impromptu stop at a shop. It will balance the weight better and not be in the way when carrying up stairs.

I don't pack a ton of stuff for my commute (pants, shirt, shoes, lunch), and it feels good to have the weight on me instead of behind me."

When it gets > 60F and humid in the morning, I wear shorts/tshirt and change in the bathroom at work.    2) Ride slow but if you get sweaty, sweat doesn't smell - sweaty clothes smell.  Changing into something fresh and using some wet wipes works wonders.  3) I have a backpack/pannier combo that I use to carry extras.  In the summer, I'll use it to carry my work clothes, lunch, rain jacket, etc."
bikecommuting,3db0or,Radixx,11,Tue Jul 14 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"For trips of 5 miles or less, I don't change clothes. Unless I go all out, or it is the humid hot part of the summer, I don't sweat all that much if I go at a moderate pace. Even in the summer, I usually go early enough in the morning that it is not a problem. I almost always take at least one pannier with me when I go to work in case I want to take something home. If I am planning on picking up something really large after work, I might take a trailer."
bikecommuting,3db0or,vhalros,2,Tue Jul 14 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm curious because you mentioned you have a trailer, how often do you use it on roads? I've had mine for about a month now but I'm somewhat hesitant to take on a road with cars, so far I've only used it around my house/neighborhood."

The one I have is the Burley Travoy (they have various bags that attach to the thing). I'm not really hesitant to bring it out on the road at all. Going straight you don't notice it much, on sharp turns you will notice it a little. And, of course if it is heavily loaded, it is noticeable going up hill and when accelerating. I live in the Somerville/Cambridge area of Greater Boston, so bicycle infrastructure is pretty good for a US city and I don't often feel compelled to try to keep up with car traffic."

I can shower at work so I don't worry about it and ride hard, but if I'm biking somewhere that I can't shower, I just take it easy and get there early so I can freshen up in the restroom. I can also get by with just a wipe down and changing clothes 8 months out of the year. A second pannier. In theory I could also carry a 3rd bag on my back, but I have only ever even needed a 2nd pannier on 2 occasions in 2 years on the bike. I will also plan ahead and take things home in stages. Like if I'm taking a trip and need some of the shoes/jackets that I store at work, I'll take home 1 item per day for a week instead of filling a 2nd pannier the last day."

Carry two shirts to the office if I have space for it. Keep an (additional) extra set of clothes at the office as well. Arrive early, before anyone else is around to smell me, and/or wash down a bit in the bathroom sink before I go inside.

You can use the showers in the morning, and on days off, you can spend some time on cross training or other interesting classes.

When you get to work and start the change of clothes, wet the towel with the alc and wipe down your neck (face if your skin isn't sensitive), then armpits and groin. Alcohol evaporates fast which soaks up a solid amount of heat, and since it kills bacteria (the source of odor) you'll have quite a while longer before that stank sets in. I'm 320 lbs and it's 90F+ from now till September here , and it's always kept the aroma from showing up until well after I've had the chance to get home and shower.

And when was the last time you had a tuneup? All of those things will make an enormous difference in how fast you can go:   If you're on a single-speed beach cruiser holding 9-10mph in humidity with some hills, you're hauling ass. If you're on a modern 9-11sp road bike that gets regular maintenance holding 9-10mph with a ton of clmbing and/or shitty roads, you're hauling ass. If you're on a beater department store BSO (bicycle shaped object) that's never been tuned and has a perpetual slow leaking tire, holding 9-10mph in basically any conditions, you're hauling ass.   I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're riding on a beater bike, live in an area with a lot of hills, or don't keep the pressure up inside your tires. All of those will sap a TON of efficiency and ultimately speed from your commute."

bikecommuting,3dbaa9,scizorious,5,Tue Jul 14 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"Your mtb is going to be just fine.  Five miles seems far on foot, but on a bike it's actually really quick.  You could do five miles on any sort of bike.  Get a rack and panniers, though. Absolutely lifesaving when it comes to commuting. Speaking of rack's panniers, you could transport your clothes in a garment bag-style pannier.  Or roll it up and stuff it into a normal one--just don't try to fold it or you'll get wrinkles everywhere.  Honestly, though, unless it's very hot or you're riding VERY hard, you shouldn't work up much of a sweat over 5 miles--especially if you're going downhill TO work.  I'd say just wear the suit once or twice and see how it goes."

Went from about 12 miles each direction to probably about 1 mile after my office and i both moved downtown. :)  As for rack, with a MTB i'm pretty sure any old thing will do, especially since you aren't planning to go touring or anything.  I use a rack made by these guys, and it's been pretty nice.   Panniers...I have no idea.  I've never had to use them--the garment style ones, I mean.  I use normal ""bag"" panniers every day.

I soon may be joining you in the reduced commute department, we are looking at moving downtown in a year or so since we both will work downtown for the foreseeable future. It won't be as much of a commute being able to just walk through the skyways to get to work.  Is pannier just a fancy name for bike mounted bag? Pannier doesn't include the rack as well as I understand. I only am trying to be really specific because there is a great bike shop near my place and the guys who work there are all super friendly and I would like to make at least some purchases through them to support the small business community. I don't want to sound like a complete ass not knowing what different things are.   Again, I appreciate all the information!"
bikecommuting,3dbaa9,mattkatzbaby,2,Wed Jul 15 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well, panniers are a specific type of bike-mounted bag.  They're larger bags that hang over the wheels on a rack, instead of being ""in line"" with the wheels/frame.  They can be mounted front/rear/both, depending on bike and tastes.  Other types of on-bike storage you'll find are...  saddlebags (generally used for repair tools/spare tires/tire levers/etc)  frame bags (never used them, but most people I've seen use them to carry food and clothes.  might work for you?)   bar bags (usually used by people on tour to store food/phone/keys/other stuff they want to keep at hand.  bucket panniers (generally used as a dirt cheap alternative to buying panniers OR by people on tour because they're large and waterproof."

bikecommuting,3dbaa9,ticktocktoe,2,Wed Jul 15 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"A little input from a rather newby bike commuter:  Distance: 5 miles isn't bad at all. It won't take you a lot of time and you'll very quickly get used to it. I do about 6 miles and I got used to it within less than a week, reducing the time for the trip by over a third in that time. I could imagine that the uphill leg on the way home might be a bit of a pain, but likewise I think you'll get used to it rather quickly and you can take a shower at home as it's the return trip anyways.  Bike: Obviously a street bike is more efficient, but personally I found it's much more important you like the bike. I own a street bike (sort of) but never liked it. So when I started bike commuting I actually bought a second hand mountain bike simply because I liked it, and I haven't regretted it. If you want to go for efficiency then go for a street bike, but otherwise just use whatever you like. (It's ""only"" 5 miles we're talking about, so efficiency really shouldn't be a big issue.)  Clothes: I can't really give you any input on this as I luckily don't have to wear a suit at work. If you have a car and simply prefer bike commuting because you want workout/because it's great/for any other reason you might consider using the car every other week or so to take along whatever you need, e.g. for taking home the suit for washing. If it weren't a suit you could just as easily just put it in a back pack.  Please do take whatever I say with a grain of salt, I only began bike commuting a rather short time ago. But so far I haven't regretted it in the slightest!"
bikecommuting,3dbaa9,pluginmeerkat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. My main issue with my current bike is the seat. I like the riding position and height just fine. Would simply changing the seat be an easy fix or does the seat shape correspond to the bike type? I think my issue with the seat is simply that I don't ride enough and with more riding I will get used to it. That has always worked for my motorcycles.  I think now that keeping 2 or 3 suit coats and a sport coat in the office could work for a week. If I have court I know well in advance and can pack matching suit pants. And if a client shows up out of the blue I can simply throw on my sport coat.
bikecommuting,3dbaa9,planification,2,Tue Jul 14 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Go to your local bike shop. Find a seat you like. Buy it. If you really aren't mechanically inclined have them mount it.   Most bike shops will have a bin of ""used"" sadles, which normally are just taken off a floor model when someone buys it and want a new seat installed. Shouldn't cost you more than 30 bucks all said and done."
bikecommuting,3dbaa9,atlasMuutaras,2,Wed Jul 15 02:33:54 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing something crucial I'd say the saddle shape doesn't have to correspond to the bike type, certainly not in this particular context. You're not going for street-cred, so...  But if you want to avoid expenses just try your current bike and saddle for a week. I'm not pulling your leg, this here is what one week (!) of bike commuting did for me: - Commute time for my 6 mile trip went down from 40 minutes to 25 minutes. - I used to do most of the trip in medium gear, now I go most of it in the highest gear and it doesn't feel more effort than did the lower gear in the beginning. - My butt hurt quite a bit in the beginning. Now I hardly feel the saddle anymore. (In a good way, not saying all my nerves are dead now, hehe.) - I lost much of my excess fat. Ok, it wasn't too much to begin with but my weight definitely was heading the wrong way and I got that turned around nicely.  So, basically: Just go for it! You are very likely to love it!

bikecommuting,3dbaa9,awesometographer,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what you mean by ""bead size.""  Is that the internal diameter of the tire?  Because that is a number you should be paying attention to--a 26"" tire obviously won't fit on a 29"" wheel.  The width is a matter of personal preference.  Wider tires are generally considered slower, but more comfortable     A note about tire sizes:  Mountain bikes generally come with either 26"" or 29"" wheels/tires.  Road bikes and hybrids are generally sized ""700c"".  Technically 700c and 29"" are the same diameter, but I doubt you'd be able to squeeze a big fat MTB tire into a wheel designed for 700c road wheels.  Oh, and if you're looking for advice on upgrading parts/etc, you'd do VERY well to ask on /r/bikewrench first.

bikecommuting,3d9g11,Nerdlinger,3,Tue Jul 14 15:23:16 2015 UTC,My reaction then is probably due to lack of experience with Bicycle Boulevards. Is their strength simply because they are suggested routes along side roads that are already low-traffic?
bikecommuting,3d9g11,BBnet3000,9,Tue Jul 14 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"Ideally they go further to reduce the traffic on them so that they are local access only for cars, but provide through-routes for cycling.  This is the thing you really have to hold them to. In some places they don't do anything to reduce automobile through-traffic and they end up having too many cars to share the road with comfortably.  The level of bike infrastructure needed on a route depends largely on the level of traffic (as well as traffic speeds). In The Netherlands most neighborhood streets have no specific bike infrastructure at all except for the elimination of through-traffic. In a car you have to take a main road to get anywhere."
bikecommuting,3d9g11,beercules44,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"Vancouver BC has an excellent network of bicycle boulevards in that case.  8th and 10th going E/W are HUGE highways for bicycles, to the point where cars really can't use them for anything except local traffic.  The issue with this is you need a critical mass of bicyclists within the city to make it seem like it's actually a bicycle highway, and not just another street for the cars."
bikecommuting,3d9g11,Nerdlinger,2,Wed Jul 15 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. And the fact that motorists learn really quickly to take a different road when possible, so they almost turn into super-wide bike paths."

This is where sharrows (kinda) make sense.  Putting sharrows along a long stretch of road is a cop-out. I believe it's a problem when these get put on a ""map"" (as has been done in your city) and are considered part of the bicycling infrastructure grid. They don't have the political will to put proper infrastructure, so they paint a bike on the ground and call it job done.   The one defence I've seen for sharrows like this is that they are a sign of things to come: that they will (marginally) encourage a bike route, that can, in the future, justify a proper cycle track."

bikecommuting,3d9g11,exFAL,6,Tue Jul 14 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"They're intended to be used on narrow, 2-lane roads--sometimes with medians--where a car could not physically pass a cyclist while maintaining the minimum legal passing buffer (3 ft in a lot of places). And ideally they would be there because that is a common route taken by cyclists--often a connecting road between 2 unconnected bike lanes/cycle tracks. It's to let any driver who is thinking about honking their horn at a cyclist taking the lane that they have been officially blessed, and even instructed, by the local government to bike exactly where they are. It incentivizes cyclists to intentionally take that road, which creates a critical mass and also encourages drivers to not bike somewhere that they know will have more cyclists.  FWIW, we have sharrows in my city (in addition to a lot of other bike infrastructure) and I have never been honked at while taking the lane with sharrows, but have been honked at on roads that needed sharrows and didn't have them."

bikecommuting,3d9g11,fluxtime,3,Tue Jul 14 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how bike planning has started out in a lot of areas for years.  I wouldn't blame it on your city so much as I would the precedent available to them.    The basic idea behind sharrows is that many people don't even realize they can cycle on the street.  The sharrows help to legitimize them as traffic.  Also, any sort of indication that bikes may be present, whether it be a sign or paint on the ground has been shown to reduce cyclist injuries.  If used effectively, they can dissuade people from riding in the door zone too.  And they also typically come with some wayfinding signs, maybe even some data that gets picked up by Google Maps.  When people can plan a route that's lower stress, they're more likely to make a trip via bike.  Try it on a street like Gage Blvd, and they may never try it again.  Bicycle boulevards offer some similar benefits, but also restrict traffic in some way so you're really only getting drivers on the street that live in the immediate area.  Less traffic makes it more comfortable to ride.    Long term, the next step should be counting cyclists.  When it comes time to apply for state and federal funding, having this data will help to make the case for better infrastructure, maybe something protected with a curb.  I'd also try to get them to spend money on bike parking.  This is really easy to do since they pretty much just have to bolt some metal racks to the sidewalk.  Overall, it's definitely an incremental process.  Be glad that it's started, and stay involved so they can get to the next steps sooner."

No, of course not. But we have zero bicycle infrastructure right now. Anything at all is an improvement. I'm willing to bet those sharrows in your town are showing up because somebody in local government really cares about cycling and that's the best they can get approved with the perceived level of interest in the community. Local government is very reactive. If you want better cycling infrastructure in your town, you need to recruit what we refer to as ""major stakeholders"" in plannerese. Examples would be prominent local businesses, large health systems, universities, etc. Get them to provide letters in support of real infrastructure for bikes.

The reason I say that is because I used to ride with this group every week; some of them were Cat 5 racers, some were amateurs like me. My goal every week was to improve how far I could go in their peloton before being dropped. I was riding in an old steel frame road bicycle (pic of actual bike) which was not even my size. I was using toe cages and a ladies purse around my waist (I couldn't afford a jersey at the time).  Some day, one of the leading guys was determined to not let me get dropped, so he slowed down the back of the line and started yelling at me GO GO KEEP GOING and pushed my back. It was really nice of him (although I got dropped a couple miles later anyway). When I got back to the meeting point, this guy complimented me, saying that I was proof that the engine was the important part, the bicycle is just an instrument. This is one of the fondest memories I carry about bicycling.  Later on, I got a better paying job, got a new, nice bicycle, some clipless pedals and my expectations were high.

At this point your best bet for keeping up with the group would probably be to draft near the back of the paceline. This should give you a 20-30% boost. It's usually bad etiquette to hang at the back and not take your turn pulling, but if they are pushing the pace too hard then I think there's no other good option."
bikecommuting,3d9y4a,hotrod_a_la_jesus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"I can't help you with your overall ability to keep up with the roadies, but I did want to congratulate you for being the first guy that didn't quit. I passed about 10 riders on my first century, only to find out they all dropped out and I was the last rider in. Normally, I'd feel pretty bummed about being last, except I felt overwhelming pride for sticking it out when I wanted to stop. Believe me, I wanted to stop like nobody's business. Same thing happened on a hard climb I did in June. I was the last bike in and many behind me didn't finish the ride.   So, just remember that when you start to get discouraged. You'll get there, but only by not dropping out. Keep up the good work! (pssst.... and the most important part is to have fun)"
bikecommuting,3d9y4a,YellowKingNoMask,6,Wed Jul 15 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"So, everybody telling you that 'it's not the bike' is sort of right . . . but also not.  I'm betting that most of them aren't riding hybrids on 20-30 mile group rides alongside road bikes.  Road / racing bikes have the geometry they have for a reason, because it's easier to get into and maintain a pace at the expense of a 'comfortable' upright posture.  Part of the benefit of faster geometry is the 'comfort'.  Once you're down in the drops, and have your weight shifted forward, you're not comfortable unless you're working at it.  While your Insight has you sitting back (probably).  The comfortable way to ride in that posture is at a moderate commuter speed, and that's what the bike was built for.  Of course you can ride it however you want.  Be the dude who kills everyone on their hybrid, it's definitely possible.  But I bet that if you found yourself even an entry level road bike, one with dropbars and 'road' geometry (a design that puts you down and forward), you'd see a big improvement in your ability to keep up.  I found that when I upgraded from an MTB to a road bike, it was much easier to get down and really pump when I wanted to."
bikecommuting,3d9y4a,hotrod_a_la_jesus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"I really like your reply. I don't want to complain much about my gear, but that's what I realized when I rode last time. Sadly , most of the helpful answers tell me to 'get better gear'. I will try to push myself and be, as you put it, 'the dude who kills everyone on their hybrid'"
bikecommuting,3d9y4a,exFAL,2,Tue Jul 14 22:00:49 2015 UTC,I rode a bybrid (specialized sirrus sport) when I first started. I replaced it with a road bike (trek 1.5) and don't regret one ounce of that move.   Just get the road bike. You know you want to. :)

bikecommuting,3d9y4a,exFAL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:08:50 2015 UTC,"Of course the answers are going to be mostly ""get better gear"". It's much easier than telling you to be in better shape.

bikecommuting,3d9y4a,onseali,5,Thu Jul 16 23:14:21 2015 UTC,"You could think about putting smoother, narrower tires on, if you have knobby mountain tires on now. I suggest getting tires with the highest pressure ratings you can find. I recommend getting some better expertise before going narrower. The engine can only do so much when you have the friction from those wider, softer tires to overcome.   You might try coasting a little on the steeper downhills, to conserve that energy for the uphills, if you are faster on the downhill. It depends on you, terrain and bike if this will make you faster overall, or just less tired.  Keep in mind that however close you stay, you are getting stronger. It is a sweet feeling to ride with (or pass!) someone with a significantly better bike.  Try to find someone with a similar speed and ride with them - can you invite someone, that maybe has a similar bike."

Since you're on a hybrid, I'm assuming flat bars, so maybe you could add on some cheap bar ends to give you the option to get a little lower and cut down on wind resistance. If everyone is comfortable with it, you could also try to draft one of the other riders to make things a little easier on yourself."
bikecommuting,3d9y4a,rabbitspy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:38:59 2015 UTC,Clipless = brtter acceleration? Really?   On both my hybrid and single speed I have flats.

bikecommuting,3d9y4a,xoxoamy,2,Wed Jul 15 10:13:34 2015 UTC,"Ride harder ;).   Kidding aside, maintain a proper cadence, slam stem, add bar ends and some way of foot retention, check lubrication, inflate tires to max. pressure. Then ride harder."

bikecommuting,3d9y4a,locovelo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"If this is your bike, a cheap-ish way to reduce air-resistance is another stem, they come in different length/angles, you can start with turning it upside down to lower the handlebar a bit. (The picture shows some rings below the stem, you can swap rings/stem for a lower handlebar position).        As a result of the more forward leaning position, you probably need to move the saddle back as well, and as that increases the distance to the pedals, it also needs to be lowered.       Handlebar width, smaller is less air-resistance. By just moving grips/brakes inward you can test the minimum width you are comfortable with (including off-road), that also makes room for bar-ends, another way to lower your upper body for less frontal area. If you are happy with a narrower handlebar, use a pipe-cutter to make it permanent."

There is no real reason why the UK can’t build cycle infrastructure similar to that of the Netherlands or Denmark.

It's not a grid-system (like Manhattan and most American Cities). Roads shoot off at all angles and come in all sizes. For every road, every turn, and every junction you'd need to come up with a new, workable solution. It's not even that great for cars, part of the reason everyone drives, walks, and rides like frustrated maniacs in London is the sheer randomness of the layout.  There's no space, and there never will be. Half the roads were built for horses, carts, and pedestrians, though now we expect them to hold pavements, at least two car lanes, crossings, and bike paths. There will never be segregated bike paths in London because there's nowhere to put them without turning every road into a one-way street, or squeezing pedestrians in a sitcom-sized pavement.

I invite you to imagine maybe 5% of London's roads provided with some kind of segregation, filtering, priority or some such, creating a grid of safe, fast, direct bike paths across the city.

Any tires are going to crack with age, any bar tape is going to go to shit after 30 years, bearings are going to gunk up, cables are going to seize, derailleurs and geared hubs are going to need cleaning and adjustment, brake pads are going to turn to rocks and seats are going to become hard and brittle.

All under the magnificant assumption most people assume, ""bikes were made better back in the day"". Which I'd be curious as to know how one could arrive at that assumption, since to anyone interested in bikes beyond just buying one, the opposite of that quoted statement is common knowledge.

Your best bet is to take a more inconvenient, but safer route.  I have no idea where this is but I imagine that you are supposed to stay in the right lane, and only move to the left when you are preparing to turn. Getting out of the way of busses is on you, either by finding a spot in-between cars in the adjacent lane, or simply slowing down and waiting behind the bus, if they aren't stopped for long.  If I'm ever in a similar situation, where I would have to cross lanes of traffic to turn left, I would either yield to cars behind me, then cross the lanes. Or if there's a stoplight at my turn, stay in the right lane, cross the intersection, then put myself waiting for the red light in the perpendicular direction."

Upon all roadways, any vehicles proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place under the conditions than existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic, or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into an alley, private road or driveway.

As a lady biker, I (and my coworkers, sorry guys) just deal with me being sweaty. I work at a casual place, I don't really wear makeup besides eyeliner, I have short hair. But it IS an annoyance--changing in a tiny bathroom stall is undignified and tricky for tall people (which I am), and if I have a particular reason to look nice that day, it does suck to try to appear professional while you also look like you've melted. I don't think it's crazy to think that a good number of professional women would bike more if this wasn't an issue.  Of course, the answer to this would be to encourage employers to provide showering facilities (or maybe have showers at bikeshare stations! yes I know that's extremely pie-in-the-sky), not to tell women to turn their work vehicle into something a girl named Ashley would get for her 5th birthday.

bikecommuting,3cvcqm,agp54,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:05:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who owns several of both kinds of light, I feel like this article missed several points.   Batteries are expensive and burn quickly.  Classiness  Everything is waterproof You don’t have to think about lights, ever. They’re brighter than most battery powered bikes They’re far less likely to be stolen as they aren’t commonly traded commodities, can’t be easily installed They last longer than battery operated lights   Batteries - dynamo lights completely remove the hassles of batteries, both in charge and in reliability. Remembering to charge? Don't have to do it. Ride lasted to long and ran out of battery? No issue any more for any length of ride. Battery gets old and runs out before ride is over because of it's age? Doesn't happen. Battery doesn't last as long because it's cold (winter biking)? No problem any more. Left your light at home? Nope, it's permanently attached to the bike.  They're like the lights on your car, except even better as the led bulbs don't burn out. You don't even think about lighting - you just turn it on when it gets dark and it works, always.  They're not brighter than battery powered lights though (I assume battery powered ""bikes"" is a typo). They have some advantages because they have shaped beams like car lowbeams that don't waste light going up, and don't get into people's eyes (if aimed properly). They're good enough for 90% of riding, but the very worst lighting conditions (very bright lights mixed with completely unlit dark sections all within what you can see) a good battery light is still better, unfortunately."

bikecommuting,3cta5x,wellthisisabadidea,23,Fri Jul 10 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"I commute 2hrs to work everyday through some shady neighborhoods and factory districts in LA.  I have been held at gun point, knife point, and by mobs.  Other than outright thefts I also get assaulted either by bottles, trash, intimidation by vehicles, etc. About once a week at least some ""thug"" will threaten me in one way or another while I ride past him.  With straight up jackings with a gun/knife I just give them whatever they want.  The one time I was held at gunpoint I was stopped at a stop sign waiting to make a right turn onto a busy street from a side street. Guy walked up to me and lifted up his shirt to show me a gun tucked into his pants and told me ""get off"".  I did and started to back away from him.  He got on my bike and told me to give him my phone and wallet.  I did give him a phone but I didn't have a wallet with me.  He got pissed and rode over, patted me down.  Saw for himself that I didn't have a wallet so he just road off down the side street I came from.  Lesson: Don't be on a street that doesn't have a lot of traffic, even if it appears to be visible from he main road.  Like 20 cars must have passed me on the main street but because I am standing in the side street, I don't think anyone even guessed that I was being jacked. Since that day I always plan my routes to be only on main roads.  I know it's a bit more dangerous but once you get used to it dodging doors and the occasional car hooking me or crowding me isn't so bad as long as I am vigilant.  I've been threatened with a knife on two occasions.  Both times I was stopped at a light.  The first time I was once again on a small side street. (AVOID SIDE STREETS IN SHITTY NEIGHBORHOODS!) Guy just jumped in front of my bike, grabbed the handlebar with one hand and shoved a knife in front of my face and started swearing.  I stepped off the bike but he wasn't even interested in the bike he just followed me and pushed me onto the sidewalk where he started to rummage through my pockets.  He grabbed my backpack and ran away.  The second time, a very menacing looking guy started to attempt to make conversation with me saying ""hey that's a nice bike. where did you get it?  It's hot today, etc etc"" Giving off a weird vibe until he got close enough to place his hand on my shoulder and telling me he will beat me up and kill me. I pushed him off only to see that he had a knife in his other hand so I booked it. Just kicked off the curb and started to pedal like a mad man.    Lesson:  Don't engage in conversation with people if it doesn't feel right.  You should always be weary of people approaching you off the street.  Being ganged up on by a group of guys is also no fun.  I don't know why but most of the troubles I have in bad neighborhoods is always from small groups of guys.  Two or three guys will come threaten me, throw shit at me,try to start fights, etc.  The worst was when I was riding through a shady part of Van Nuys and these 4 guys surrounded me while I was stopped on the sidewalk.  They basically threatened to kick my ass as they took everything off me, and ran off.  Lesson: Try not to put yourself in a situation where you can be surrounded or cornered.  When groups approach you always be moving.  They can say shit and threaten you but as long as you are moving away from them many times they will back off.  But even with all that, its still mostly uneventful.  Most days if you mind your own and obey the laws and be aware of your suroundings, its just another day on your bike.  Some general tips:  Stay on main roads.  Stay away from parked cars (I've had two instances where they accused me of bumping their cars so they can try to start a fight with me) and take the lane if at all possible.  Usually people don't follow you into the middle of the road.  Unless they be crazy hobos.  Stay off the sidewalk if you can.  So easy to be crowded in there and poor visibility from the cars passing by.  Don't talk to people.  Especially the crazy ones. In a big city, anyone who initiates a conversation with someone passing by is not a friend.  Don't expect help from others.  This is the hood.  They don't give a shit.  Pedestrians will cross the street away from commotion.  Business Owners rarely leave their shop to help you.  Don't carry money or valuables if you can.  If you have to, keep that shit in your pocket.  If you can afford it, get a second bike.  One that you don't mind losing.  Commuting isn't a race, you can leave your racer at home and make due with a beater.  Don't carry weapons like a knife or pepper spray.  Most times they just make the situation worse.  Just give them what they want.  If people mess with you, just ignore it and move on.  Telling them off will just make them mad.  Confronting them will only put yourself in more danger.  Yeah, it sucks. But better a hurt feeling than a beating.  Seriously, I am so chill these days once I figured out how to let shit go.  Remember it's probably not even about you.

Proportional punishment is important for a just society and disproportionate punishment weakens respect for the rule of law.   I think bikes should be ticketed a little higher than skateboards, which should be ticketed a little higher than pedestrian violations.   Some currently illegal ticketed behavior should be legalized.    Pedestrians, skateboarders and cyclists should be able to cross empty intersections against the light.

bikecommuting,3cx9zv,FelixW26,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'm probably more in favour of following the rules of the road than many other cyclists, but I do think that ""stop"" signs should be more like a ""slow down"" sign for cyclists.  A cyclist has much more visibility/awareness of what's going on around them than someone in a car. So I think as long as you slow down enough that you can stop if you need to, and have a good look at the intersection then you aren't doing anything dangerous by not coming to a complete stop.  But it does depend on the intersection in question as well. Sometimes it's just hard to see what's coming until quite late, so in those situations it probably is better to just stop.  Basically I think the rules for cyclists and stop signs should be more situational. If the cyclist just flies out into the intersection then ticket the fool. If they slow down and are clearly being careful then leave them go about their day."
bikecommuting,3cx9zv,mattkatzbaby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:32:41 2015 UTC,I would agree with you. In Idaho it is just that.   The point here is no one is going to change the rules unless it causes an impact into their driving habits.

bikecommuting,3crcu4,finalcutlery,3,Fri Jul 10 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"A commute by any means becomes a grind - I find it helps to break it up, which might be as simple as not going in 1 day, or in my case, driving in.  I find that if I am relaxed about how long I take, I may take a few more minutes, but it takes much of the stress out, making it a lot more palatable to think about doing it again the next few days.  You should try to find an alternate way to get in, even if you try to use it minimally. Did you ride everyday in SF, even during the rainy season? Having the alternate will make you feel better about having a response to weather, illness, and breakdown.  Also, I commute in earlier, to have less traffic than the traditional time commute. Having it so sweet 1 way makes it a lot more appealing."

I love commuting by bike even though my route more or less sucks the whole way (cycling in NYC is not as good as in San Francisco). Personally it helps me to have a destination. Its a lot harder for me to get out and do a 45 minute recreational ride than it is to commute. On the rare occasion that I take the subway to work my day is far worse off for it (and it costs me $5.50).  I normally bring lunch to work, if I'm feeling hesitant to ride I think about the fact that the subway costs the better part of the cost of buying lunch. I'd rather treat myself to that than pay for transportation.  FYI there's a secureish bike parking area behind 40 W 4th St. Its easily accessed via W 3rd St up a short flight of stairs and you use your student ID to get in."

The latter is harder than it seems (at least it was for me). I used to ride really hard every day. It made me feel tired and I barely could ride by Thursday or Friday.

It's not a skill you want to try and teach yourself while out on the road.  On another note, I used to use CO2, but I switched back to a frame pump for a couple reasons. 1) cost. A pump is a one time expense and costs about the same as a CO2 setup. 2) trash. I don't like adding cartridges to the waste stream.  3) Pumps don't run out. Early in my commuting life I had a case where I had a flat, thought I fixed it, went a little way and... nope. I botched the patch. But, I was now out of cartridges. Fortunately, a friend had a frame pump and I was good to go.  To each their own though. If CO2 is good for you, go for it. I'm just offering a case for frame pumps."

If you buy accessories, you should make sure they'll fit on your next bike and therefore have an idea what bike that'll be. A pretty standard recommendation is the Surly LHT (Long-Haul Trucker, a touring bike) for that kind of distance and a more relaxed posture, though it's not as upright as what you've already got. The LHT is Surly's best option if you intend to use panniers; the chain stays are long enough that hitting them with your heels won't be a problem. You can find a LHT on Craigslist for ~1/3 of their retail price if you check often enough. I picked up a 2009 Surly Cross-Check for $500 (retails for $1250) in 2013, but it's needed quite a bit of work since then... probably due to the 4000+ miles I've put on it. The difference between the two is a more relaxed posture on the LHT; the CC (Cross-Check) is a frame that's a cross between a mountain bike and a road bike. Keeping within the Surly family to give you an idea of the variations, the Pacer would be next in line in this progression and a more aggressive posture than either the LHT or CC. Maybe the LHT isn't quite relaxed enough for you, so maybe check into mixte bikes.  Also, I described a lot of my equipment in a recent post, so take a look if you need lights, tools, panniers, etc. Was going to post a picture, but Imgur seems to be down."

I had an old 90's mountain bike I kept around just for commuting and grocery getting, while I collected decent (by my standards) road and mountain bikes.  And yes, also save for your bike to adventure with.  Since you want a really upright position, maybe something like the Raleigh Detour or Trek Verve  However, you might want to look into proper touring bikes as /u/environmentalent suggests.

bikecommuting,3co4n7,slaeggan,2,Thu Jul 9 12:50:07 2015 UTC,Yes but when it's snow/showing I have great gear I can use. Pretty much the same gear I use for cross-country skiing.   The layer upon layer principle has been working great so far on occasional rides during the winter  Mainly it's the rain I'm not prepared for
bikecommuting,3co4n7,GeorgeOwnwell,2,Thu Jul 9 12:57:40 2015 UTC,Breathable rain coats. The high end ones that have a cotton feel and get a pattern when wet are best. I like wicking undergarments/or wool. I prefer to dress light. I always am a little chilly until I'm warmed up in the winter.
bikecommuting,3co4n7,pixelgrunt,2,Thu Jul 9 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"If you are warm for the first 15 minutes of a cold-weather ride, then you are overdressed unless your ride is only 15 minutes."

But my distance is more like 5km so a high average speed isnt important for me. I find that biking keeps me warm enough when I just have jeans, teeshirt, rain/wind jacket, helmet and finger gloves, but I do wear long johns under the jeans around january/feb. I also use normal boots with a medium cut, to keep feet dry.  However I keep a winter jacket and sweater in the pannier bag. If for some reason my bike breaks and I want to put on more clothes. I need them anyway, during lunch or if I get other plans after work than biking home.  If you too are in Stockholm, check out decathlon in Kungens kurva. I've been very happy with this http://www.decathlon.se/regnjacka-for-cykling-300-id_8315311.html as it covers the butt. Don't dress too much under it, a long part of the winter I just have a long sleeve teeshirt underneath. I.e. I deal with avoiding sweat inside by balancing less clothes with how warm biking makes me.  Its almost now during the summer that I need more tech gear, or a full change, because even in a teeshirt and shorts I arrive to work sweaty. I'm unable to go so slow that I dont break a sweat."

bikecommuting,3co4n7,Yoon-Jae,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:17:51 2015 UTC,I'm looking to buy a pair of winter boots. They look really comfortable!   Any recommendations regarding brands (jacket/pants)?   GORE looks promising but I would love some suggestions
bikecommuting,3co4n7,light_pedals,2,Thu Jul 9 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"TL;DR I like my GORE pants.  I have a pair of GORE pants. I highly recommend the brand. I use them for rain/wet snow commutes - typically between 28F/-2C and 60F/16C. In that range they perform well. At low temps, they work great to keep the slush and cold wind at bay (I also wear them to keep the wind chill off in January-February when the wind chill dips below 0F/-18C). At higher temps, they keep me dry from rain, but I do start to sweat more than normal. Above about 60F/16C I find that I care less about getting wet on my relatively short commute (6mi/10km), so I haven't really worn them then. Additionally, the cycling specific nature means that they have a nice cut for cycling and they have extra reinforcement around the crotch.  Prior to the GORE pants I had a pair of Cannondales that disintegrated in one ride, and a pair of Bontragers that sprung a leak within 2 rides. Both issues arose with the tape on the seams around the crotch.  For jackets, I am less finicky. I have a Fox lightweight cycling jacket I use for sprinkles, a North Face rain coat for heavier rain (above freezing), and a Salomon lightweight nordic ski soft shell that I use for anything (rain/snow/shine) below 40F/4C.

I don't swap very often, mind you. Most wheel switches happen in the fall and again in spring when the weather can't decide between icy and not-icy streets (I commute by bike year-round)."

So not too bad, for not having to force studded Marathons on and off rims multiple times per winter. :)   I don't swap chains for every wheel change, no. It's not ideal for the cassette but I can live with that. I change my chain anyway every 2000-3000 km or so, not letting it wear too much."

I was waiting on my signal to go with a few other people already there when one of the cars in one of the lanes stopped to ""let"" me go through, never mind that the other three lanes were still flowing at a regular pace. I pointed up at the green light and crossed my arms and made a cartoony-looking toe-tapping gesture to indicate that I could wait forever or at least 15-20 seconds remaining until the light changed.

I consider a cyclist crossing a red-light with a pedestrian signal or running a stop sign on par with Jay-walking, that is extremely minor and just a little annoying. I rarely see wrong way*, red light blowing, no look stop sign blowing, cycling and I ride through the heart of the city every day.   *we have route that goes the wrong way for 1/4 block and I hate it, but on my way home I do salmon for 1/4 block on a weird side street, but I was told to do this by someone in the city."

For a bike that bump really isn't there.

In many ways we're all at fault -- bicyclists and drivers.
bikecommuting,3cfphf,tracer_ca,7,Wed Jul 8 14:27:50 2015 UTC,"Last summer I was riding through a quiet neighborhood and stopped at a stop sign because I saw a minivan approaching the intersection to my left. I always stop if cars are around, if not I'll slow down until I'm sure nobody is approaching in any direction and then go through. So anyway, I stop and wait to see what the minivan is going to do because even though I have the right of way (being to the right and having clearly arrived at the intersection first) his vehicle, of course, could kill me if a collision were involved. The minivan starts to make a right turn (in the direction I had just come from) when it stops and the driver ""minivan guy"" leans out his window and says ""Thank you! I never see cyclists stop at stop signs."" I was annoyed because he hadn't used his turn signal and thus I had to wait to see where he was going until I could go through the stop sign, so I yelled back to him ""That would mean a lot more if you were using your #@%*& turn signal."" He was totally speechless. He kinda slunk back into his car with a sheepish, guilty look on his face and drove slowly away. Usually I think of the perfect comeback 2 minutes later but this was one occasion where my wits were sharp. Score one for the cyclists."

What made it weirder was a bus and a car were ahead of me so if I ran the sign they would have too.   Of course I usually walk the same route because I like listening to podcasts to and from work and I always have to watch every car when I cross the street.

I don't think it's confirmation bias; many cyclists roll stops; I know I have on occasion. I do think there's a difference between that and blowing through; you have superb situational awareness on a bike and can normally see and hear far more clearly than in a car. Obviously the law doesn't see it that way.   I have seen cars not consider me traffic at all while on the bike, I.e. just drive the intersection out of turn.  Anecdotally I did nearly hit a cyclist at an intersection who simply emerged in front of me at great speed, blowing a red and turning right into my lane in a tidy show of cornering skill; it scared the shit out of me, and I don't think he even noticed."

The main culprit for these occurrences are (as others have mentioned) junctions and roundabouts.   One addition to my bike has drastically reduced these occurrences for me though, and that's a light. And by light I mean a super bright ""F*CKING NOTICE ME!"" light that I have running all the time. Even on a sunny day.     It's like seeing the light flicks a switch in motorists' brains telling them ""Ah, here comes some kind of vehicle which has right of way. Better wait for them to pass."". And this is exactly what happens a lot of the time. I'll come into a roundabout or junction and cars actually stop and wait their turn while I go about my way.  So my advice is to mount a a super bright (~1000 lumen) light onto your bike and have that bad boy running when cycling in traffic."

I'd say I was a reasonably good rider but could be fairly aggressive and would sort of senselessly break the rules (stereotypical messenger style riding). She taught me a lot about route selection and that it was often worth it to ride a block out of my way for a better route, and more about considering how cars were seeing me.   A good example is track standing at lights. I love to do this, but it’s been pointed out that cars see it as being ready to launch out into traffic and it’s just kind of silly, especially if (like me) you’re still trying to get good at it so you slowly inch forward. I also now ride 2 blocks each way out of my way to ride a quiet one way street with a bike lane instead of a 2 way street where I often have to take the lane.   Either way, it took a while but eventually the little seeds sprouted and I became a much more attentive and courteous city rider. I’ve found being courteous, waves, eye contact, have made my rides very mellow, I can think of only one time in the last year I’ve been honked at and it was my fault (but I still think it was an unnecessary honk).   I’d say, keep on her about the riding style, point out that it’s really not much faster and laying low is less stressful than being belligerent and in your face.

The other thing is that as someone who is not certain about my own level, I would much, much rather piss of car drivers (dangerous) than to be perceived as a good cyclist and not be given enough room (even more dangerous). In a similar circumstance where cars might be whizzing past me, I would probably take a lane. (In reality, I would not bike under such circumstances.)

For example, riding in the middle of the lane - yes, it pisses off drivers, and you get subjected to more road rage, but it is actually much safer than riding on the edge of the lane and having the same drivers blow past too close without slowing down.  Rather than assuming that your way is right, try to learn from each other and accept that you'll never be exactly the same sort of riders.    My husband and I are both cyclists, and both find each others riding styles terrifying.  He thinks it's crazy that I choose larger roads with faster traffic and take the lane, I find it terrifying that he bombs around blind corners in residential areas and tries to squeeze right.  He thinks it's confusing to drivers that I weave around road obstructions and litter on the road,  I think it's insane that he will hop onto the sidewalk if it's not busy.  He gives me shit for my Idaho stops at stop signs (rolling stop, treat as yield), but I've been rear ended starting out of a complete stop, and am convinced they are safer. I think he signals too much, he thinks I signal too little.  I think his road rage invites trouble, he worries about me riding my townie without a helmet for short trips.

bikecommuting,3ccvd1,my_head_in_the_cloud,3,Mon Jul 6 22:42:09 2015 UTC,That's awesome. We have a few lights in Portland that don't let everyone through during rush hour. You're not used to that kind of indignation when you're riding!
bikecommuting,3ccvd1,pkulak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"I cycle over that junction everyday. It's on the CycleSuperhighway3 from Tower Bridge to Limehouse (under the DLR there).  Bonus points: if you're going west>east, traffic light phasing means that after the cycle lane light goes red, the traffic light goes green on the one way street parallel to the bike lane so if you're approaching on the bike path, you can switch to the road and still cross over (if there's a gap in traffic of course)"
bikecommuting,3ccvd1,clausy,2,Tue Jul 7 09:53:08 2015 UTC,"Just be careful when you do that because the one time I've tried, the light was also green for pedestrians at the other side of the intersection. The system assumes that traffic will only go left or right, not straight through."
bikecommuting,3ccvd1,estasseguro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:36:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know. The whole CS3 is a bit of a lottery. Pedestrians cross in random places whether they have a green light or not. You have to be supercareful with all the sideroads too. I generally slow down along there, because everything (even cyclists overtaking heading towards you) is a potential hazard! I actually think I might try to get Strava to remove their segments along there."
bikecommuting,3ccvd1,clausy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:49:32 2015 UTC,"Having that bit of extra time would be brilliant. My acceleration's not great and I always feel guilty if I've had to take the lane, or if I'm first in a bike queue at a red light, because I know that I'm probably going to be preventing somebody behind me from making it across on the next green."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,1spdbike,24,Mon Jul 6 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"I'm just annoyed by people who need to make every little ride through the city their own personal Tour de France. I almost slammed head-on into someone yesterday as I went through a bike roundabout because they, very obviously going very fast (25+mph since I was doing at least 16 and this bro was fucking flying) and rather than slow down a bit and take the proper right-hand side of the road around the roundabout, he decides to salmon his way through because that's shorter and faster.  There's a time and a place for that. There are plenty of bike lanes on the roads here and if nothing else, take the lane on a road. A winding, curvy, mixed-use path with roundabouts is not the place for that. It's no different than some d-bag in a sports car bombing through a neighborhood at 50 mph."

bikecommuting,3cat9v,h3st,12,Tue Jul 7 15:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'm squarely in the gotta go fast club. Am I fast? No. Do I unthinkingly stay at about the same, moderate-to-high level of effort? Yes. I had to start wearing a watch on my commutes to slow me down so I won't spend ten minutes waiting for a train, sweating profusely.  But the thing with going faster is that on a bike, unlike when I'm walking or driving, I can go as fast as I like. Because past a certain point, the sheer effort stops me from thinking about going faster. Walking, I'm slowed down by the lack of wheels keeping my momentum, and I'm not about to start running. Driving, all it takes is to push a pedal. And I get bored, and my mind starts to wander … which works well for walking, really.   And if you want to ride fast anyway, that’s fine too, just don’t expect me to keep up.   I don't. Ride at your own speed, dude."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,h3st,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"as fast as you want   My one neat trick for maximising ""as X as you want"" is to have a method that … doesn't scale as well. Because it turns out what we want isn't something set in stone, but dependent on how we go about it. E.g. I find I'm sated earlier with dark chocolate and lambics compared to cheap chocolate and lager.  And so on a bike we're happier with lower speeds, both because of an increased attention to danger (going 30 km/h feels a lot faster on a bike than in a car), and because of the increased exertion. So if someone passes me … I don't really have a want to catch up or anything, because that'd just be uncomfortable.  If I'm in a car and I see someone on a bike, though, I instantly regret being in a car. :^)"

bikecommuting,3cat9v,adelie42,10,Tue Jul 7 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Huge assumptions here with respect to how people feel about their ride.   As a relatively new rider, I give a lot of thought to how I feel when I ride and enjoy learning from trying different things. Long story short, I now love high cadence riding, my knees never hurt any more, smoother higher heart rate, and my commute time has actually fallen noticeably. If I had simply continued to mash the pedals the way I ""enjoyed"" at the beginning, I would likely have had to stop.   A better approach to this article would have been to outline that there is no shame in slowing down; do anything to keep moving."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,belandil,3,Mon Jul 6 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"You can go slow but still have a high cadence.   For what it's worth, I got a computer with a cadence monitor and went from rpms in the high 80s to high 90s / low 100s.  Then again, when you're in shape, an easy day might still be much faster than someone else's.  I just finished a tour and did an easy 18 mph cruising speed on my commute, which beats most people on the bike path."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"If you are going fast or slow, the highest cadence that you can maintain without becoming wobbly / unstable is going to be the most healthy for your joints and endurance. By contrast, ""pedal mashing"" is likely to have any benefit other than the false idea that the pain of a workout is a measure of its benefit.  Agreed? (As I said, I'm new and trying to learn best practices.)"
bikecommuting,3cat9v,belandil,3,Mon Jul 6 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I've read that the 80-100 rpm range is most efficient.  I've found that my knees feel a bit nicer at a high cadence, which is important since I had a torn meniscus in my right knee about a year ago.  I think anything below 80 or so is more about muscle strength, and anything above 110 or so is less efficient because it's hard to move your legs that fast.  But specific values vary by person and by bike.  I've heard Lance Armstrong has a high cadence compared to other cyclists.  Pedal mashing doesn't really help, unless it's for only a few strokes when starting out.  Some people stand up and pedal mash up hills, but I have a triple and sit down even on some steep uphills while increasing my cadence to about 110 rpm, putting my hands on the flat part of my drop bars, and moving slightly forward on the seat.  Standing has the advantage of relieving pressure on your perineum and allowing better blood flow for at least a short time.  On long rides, I find shifting hand positions helps.  But I guess this is /r/bikecommuting and not /r/Velo so not everyone has drop bars.  Casual commuters can still benefit from appropriate cadence techniques."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,kyrsjo,2,Mon Jul 6 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Multiple hand positions on flat bars is easily managed by adding ""horns"" or whatever they are called. I would not want to tour without them."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:04 2015 UTC,This aligns with what I have read. I also feel excellent overall physically so I would like think it has been due to proper technique.  Thank you for the discussion :)
bikecommuting,3cat9v,Crayz9000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"I picked up an old road bike on the cheap (<$100) and have found that shifting hand positions (as well as not using a death grip) is a must to avoid hand cramps.  There's a few parts of town in which I sometimes wish my bike had some sort of suspension, but as long as I avoid those roads (or at least take care not to hit the rutty/worn out portions), I don't particularly find the ride painful."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,belandil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:30:52 2015 UTC,On flat bars it takes about 30 miles for my hands to start getting numb.  Most commutes aren't that bad.

It's not possible to maintain for long, but it's good to work lower cadences in for strength training (which in the long run will make you faster)."

I set a new PB earlier this year, and haven't tried to beat it since.  I've tried to find some new ways home from work, which can be easy going through a city, but maybe not as rewarding (oh look, more concrete towers..).  It would be easier to get in the car, and just head to work.  This morning was no exception, but I picked up my Garmin instead of the car keys, and headed out.  It was cool this morning, too - had to wear a jacket for the first time in a few weeks.  The pull of the car key was hard to ignore.  Then again, stopping at the top of the river valley, watching the sun rise over the city..  I don't get to do that in a car.  I also don't get to stop to find a geocache that's along the way, or take a detour down a trail that I've always wondered about.  So.. yeah.  No point to my post, other than I agree and disagree at the same time :)"
bikecommuting,3cat9v,skepticalDragon,2,Mon Jul 6 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"I totally get you- I guess it's just a state of mind. One of my typical routes takes about an hour, and I'm always trying to get just under that 60 min mark to prove it to myself. Most oftentimes though, I'm 5 minutes into a headwind and thinking about how much this ride is going to suck. I think the type of bike is a factor as well. On my commuter bike, I'm not even postured for speed, so trying to go fast is the last thing I want to do. If it was a lightweight road bike that could get clipping along, I would probably feel very different."
bikecommuting,3cat9v,imighthaveabloodclot,2,Mon Jul 6 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"I don't worry about forward speed so much as cadence.

bikecommuting,3cat9v,55mph_knuckleball,3,Mon Jul 6 16:06:15 2015 UTC,Personally it just varies for me. I have a few days a week where I know I can cheat the cadence a little bit by being in a gear slightly to high and half mash half spin my way through. Then there areother days I know the effort will be hard on me and cause me to go into the red when I shouldn't. Those days I just focus less on how fast I'm going and just keeping my pedals spinning as effortlessly as possible.

I'd also be wary of a bike that wasn't meant to be a jumper that's been outfitted with a longer than stock fork and a ""dirt jumper"" seat post. It's likely been thrashed, and needing to be upgraded to ""reinforced rims"" probably backs me up on that. If you do go for it, inspect the frame very closely for cracks.   Personally, I'd go for a Cyclocross style bike that can handle wider tires if you want to retain some off road capabilities but get a more efficient road riding platform."
bikecommuting,3cecdv,james39,2,Tue Jul 7 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say but it looks like a horrible bike for commuting.  Tires look worn, and when they were new they were chunky - it's not going to be a great ride on smooth paths. The frame may be too small. You don't need a suspension fork, that's just dead weight unless your ride to work requires it. Triple chainring probably also not ideal. With an 8-speed cassette I suspect it is fairly old. No bottle cage, no obvious way to add fenders or racks which really limits your choices.  Wish I could click those little pictures and look at parts in detail for you but I'd say no."

bikecommuting,3cecdv,dhiltonp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"You'd probably fit on the bike OK. The bike itself isn't ideal for most commutes. I used to get around by mountain bike, and while not great it's doable. I stopped and got a car while instead I should have got a better bike (which I eventually did).  You're probably going to be about 2-3mph slower. As suggested elsewhere, check the frame for cracks. If you do get this bike, you're going to need to adjust the seat a lot for riding, not stunts. Basically, pull it up until it's close to your hip. When you're pedaling, your legs should never quite be fully extended. Also, you'd want to adjust the tilt of the seat so that you don't have pressure on your genitals and so that you don't feel like you'd fall off if you were biking and had no weight on the handlebars (not pulling or pushing the handlebars to keep yourself on the bike).  Before commuting 30 minutes (however long that is), I'd suggest building up to that distance by going on a short ride every other day - bike 2-3 miles one day, 3 the next, 3-4 the next... This is to build up supporting muscles. At 30 minutes, you probably don't need to do this, but it will be more pleasant."

If you like disc brakes: Surly Disc Trucker/Straggler.  LHT and Disc trucker are touring bikes, so they have relaxed geometry. Cross Check and Straggler are more similar to CX with more aggressive geometry. If I'm correct, all bikes I mention can accept max 45mm tires, they have braze-oes for a rear rack, a front rack, and full fenders.  Other popular brands which similar to Surly are: Salsa, All City, and Soma."

They're both my favorite two looks (that anodized/stainless silver look and all flat/matte black), lots of frame mounts, disc breaks etc. The Felt comes with Shimano 105 and the Fairdale comes with SRAM X7.  Anywho, I'm basically just asking if you have any experience with the Faridale? I'm currently on an aluminium/carbon fork Felt, so I have a pretty good idea how the V85 might feel. The Fairdale, however, is all steel and I can't find any actual reviews of it online."
bikecommuting,3ccys9,bosun120,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"Steel tends to feel solid and planted over buzzy road vibrations. That being said you will feel the difference between the 28c tires on the Felt and the 38c tires on the Fairdale much more than the frame material. (for reference a 42C is twice the air volume as a 28C). The fairdale has plenty of clearance for fenders and/or even bigger tires.  I ride a steel fixed gear in Chicago (flat, lots of salt in the winter slush) and am looking at the Weekender because I don't need the front derailleur (and work on my own bike so I don't like the complexity), and want the bigger 32-38c tires, some gears, and something really stout. I have not bought it yet but I took it for a test ride. The wheels and big tires are not light but are built like a tank and the air volume really gives you a plush ride and with the gears it really doesn't matter to me, and as I tend to ride with a decent amount of weight for my multi stop 15-20 mile days the bike weight matters relatively little. It's not an anvil by any means but it will likely not be as zippy from the stop light as the Felt. I love it because it is the bike I was planning on custom building (clutch equipped 1x drop bar big tire steel commuting machine with stiff outboard bearing cranks and flat pedals) but pre built so it is cheaper. I think I am going to get it once I finish saving."

Make sure your cleat positioning is over the ball of your foot. I use MKS GR-9 pedals (GR-10s would be larger, more comfortable) with toe clips/straps on this bike, but I love these DeFeet wool socks especially with cleats and wear them year round.

I have a multitool I bought at a local bike shop and a number of other hex wrenches but no torx. I have a couple of tire levers, too. Most of that all just sits in a bag. I should probably invest in a better repair kit and maybe a hand pump of some kind. I was looking at the Cygolite 400 front and rear package for my lights. Looks like a decent price for them.

bikecommuting,3cbto0,azer89,2,Tue Jul 7 11:37:21 2015 UTC,"The pump I previously linked to is a Lezyne. Depending on how much pressure your tires need, you might go for the 90psi model rather than that 120psi version. If you're using 32mm tires (70-85psi) then the 90psi model is what you want. I had thought I might go with 28mm tires (80-102psi) later, so I picked a high pressure pump. If I had to do it again, I'd stick with the 90psi high volume pump because it took 300 pumps last time I was on a highway in the middle of nowhere. Pumping took a long time... and I might stick with 32mm tires anyhow. I've biked 30 miles on starless/moonless nights with this 350 lumen light, so 400 is more than enough. We probably started around 9:45pm the last time and got back after midnight so it was pitch black the whole way."

Cut times by 15 minutes (hour to 40-45 minutes) and cost me $400. I commute 12.5 miles to work (which is also a college campus) and it's been a godsend. 5 miles or less, I'd go with a comfortable mountainbike.  If you want new, this is a pretty competent entry road bike. Little bit on the heavy side (steel / aluminum) but gets the job done nicely, rode my friend's for a week or two while I was considering a new bike, it's pretty nice.

Many of them will have 27"" wheels, which is no longer a standard wheel size. If you look at that 100-150 range, consider that you'll almost immediately have to put about $60-80 down on new tires, possibly non-dry rotten brake pads and possibly another ~$90 for new wheels.   That still comes in under your $300 budget and you could potentially have a pretty rad semi cool bike.   I can not stress good tires enough, simply put, bad tires get a lot of flats. If every time you go out to ride your bike it's got a flat, or you get flats while riding, or you just constantly fear getting a flat, you won't ride your bike. The Shwalbe Marathon in 27"" is a great commuter tire and should relieve you of this stressful burden.   Also, check out if your city has a sort of community type bike shop. Here in Denver we have ""the bike depot"" who deals with old bikes, they have boxes of old bike parts, bars, shifters, saddles, pedals, you name it. It makes owning/working on an old bike a lot easier. I recently picked up new bars for $5 and a saddle for $5."

bikecommuting,3c51f4,dhiltonp,10,Sat Jul 4 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of statistics on bicycling safety. Firstly, it's ONLY dangerous because of all the jerks in the cars. Were it not for them, it'd be almost completely safe. Secondly, it's only dangerous if, as you point out, you look at it as a per-mile basis rather than per-hour. Driving 45 miles in an hour in a car is a trip that's fairly unlikely to be replaced with 3-4 hours on a bike. Instead of living in some exurban hellhole McMansion, a bike commuter is far more likely going to live in an area much much closer to work, and thus we'd need to compare an hour in a car to an hour on a bike. Doing this makes biking much more comparable. And also, as you've said the other factor that's overlooked is that almost no one who drives gets any exercise at all. Bikers obviously get regular exercise and thus the decrease in life expectancy from increased risk of dying on the road is more than offset by the increased life expectancy from better health. The figure I've seen most commonly is about 3 years longer in favor of biking.  So biking instead of driving adds 3 years to your life. That's great and all, but a lot of people react with ""oh, but it's just 3 years at the end where I don't really care about anyway"". Well, when you're 'at the end', you most certainly WILL care about those 3 years, as every elderly person I've ever known certainly did. But the ENORMOUS thing that pretty much no one pays any attention to is number of years of quality life. Sure, adding 3 years of sitting in a nursing home, in a wheelchair or bed, with adult diapers on sounds terrible. Except someone who cycles every day/every other day isn't going to have this.  By driving, you might die at 77 with the 20 years before that being completely and totally crap. Unable to do anything. Unable to walk any distance. Unable to enjoy life. Etc. I see it all the time. Drivers I know, in their 50s, are already in such terrible physical shape that the quality of their life is greatly diminished. Cyclists on the other hand might only live a couple years longer, to 80 or something, but they won't have 20 years of shit quality of life before that, usually. I know a few 70+ year old cyclists and I have a hard time keeping up with them and I'm under 35! They're fit and healthy and look better than a lot of people I know in their 50s.  Edit: When I say I have a hard time keeping up, I'm a fit 33 yo guy and a fairly powerful cyclist. It's not that I'm slow at all, it's that the couple of older guys I know are just every bit as fast as I am."

That guy was seriously fit.  His level of fitness couldn't have been much lower than it was when he was 50, or 40 and was so far beyond your average retiree.   Regarding your points on danger. If you avoid a lot of the more risky behaviors that lead to cycling deaths, you can reduce the chance of death by about 50% (based on Boston statistics). This means not going up one-way streets, not blowing through intersections and staying out of the door zone. So even if we do have to co-exist with cars, it can be done a lot more safely and a lot of the death statistics are from cyclists who are either at fault (going wrong way up one-ways and blowing intersections) or could easily learn to avoid the risk (dooring."

Don't forget things like riding at night with subdued clothing and little or no lights, riding on sidewalks, especially on sidewalks against the flow of traffic, or hugging the curb when it's much safer to take the lane. I also wear neon reflective vest at all times because I understand how human vision works and without it there's a hundred times more chance someone will look right through me and never register in their mind that I'm even there.

Most E.R. visits (I think the number is around 75%) by cyclists resulted from events that did not involve [moving] cars, but were caused by the cyclist crashing for other reasons.  However, the fraction that involve cars are more likely to be deadly or involve serious injury.  Not all of those are the fault of the driver.  EDIT: Found the source I was remembering - http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb135.pdf.  I was low on the percentage of hospital visits that don't involve cars, but the vast majority of deaths (at least in a 6:1 ratio and probably higher since I don't think the hospital numbers includes deaths at the scene) did involve cars, so in light of that your original statement is mostly true (assuming one doesn't much fear a broken collarbone)."

I can't honestly remember the last time I crashed on my own...well, actually I can. I crash a couple times every winter, when the roads are covered in ice and slush and stuff, but I'm going like 5-10 MPH then and I just get up. Winter clothing is thick, I don't even end up with a bruise, let alone need medical attention.  By 'dangerous' I mean 'life threatening or life altering injury'. Yeah, take out all the cars and there'll still be people getting hurt, but there won't be people getting maimed or murdered by inattentive and selfish drivers.  For instance, we have a lot of 'multi-use trails' around where I live. They aren't ""danger free"" I suppose, especially not with the dog-walkers and zombie-joggers. However I can absolutely and completely be assured that I will not die or sustain injury that alters the rest of my life while riding on the trail. Could some stupid headphone blasting zombie jogger decide to spin around 180 on the trail without warning and cause my to break a collar bone (this happened to a friend of mine)? Sure, it could.

At a certain point, even cyclists and pedestrians need to be separated and the cycle traffic will need to be separated into lanes.   The chance of death or life-altering injury is very very very slim.   Except while the chances are pretty slim, the consequences are much more severe. A single crash can easy leave a cyclist unable to ride for weeks at a time. For someone who relies on their bike to get from point A to point B, I would say not being able to ride is pretty life-altering.

Either one is a lot more likely to represent real risk on a bike than per-mile.  This probably depends a lot on where you live and what kind of roads you ride on too. There's probably a huge difference between various types of places in fatality rates (as there are for pedestrian and auto driver/passenger fatality rates).   City streets seem/are chaotic but most of the time at least where I ride cars are going under 25mph. This is why I tend to stay far away from the high-speed arterial type roads as any crash at the speed cars drive on them has a much higher chance of being a deadly one."

Calculations:  One problem I'm not sure of the average speed of automobiles. Let's guess between 20 and 40 mph?  There have been 1.1 to 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled by automobile in the past 10 years, so we get .2 to .6 fatalities per million hours traveled. In terms of OP, we get something between 1 death per 5000000 hours traveled to 1 death per 2000000 hours traveled. Let's use the safer value at 1 death per 5000000 hours.  Apparently Americans on average spend around 40000 hours of their life driving (not just in an automobile). At least in SF, the average car has 1.3 passengers, so we'll say Americans spend 50k hours of their life in a vehicle. On average our drivers are halfway through their life, so our sample of the population has been in a car on average 25k hours.  So 5000000 hours / 25000 hours = 200 people.  A quick check tells me that 80% of American's do not get enough exercise, defined as at least 2.5 hours of moderate exercise or 1.5 hours of intense exercise a week. At this level of activity, people live 1.3 to 1.5 years longer than those who are less active, so we'll say our drivers will live on average 1 - 1.3 years shorter (everyone *.8).

Did you notice that without your helmet you were hyper-alert about road hazards such as broken glass, potholes, grates, other cyclists, cars, pedestrians, etc?   See? It's called risk compensation.   A well-noted example of risk compensation is that people who buckle up in cars drive FASTER than those who don't, and as we all know, speed kills. So yes mom, there's a possibility that your daughter wouldn't be a vegetable right now had you gotten off her back about wearing a damn helmet."

Don;t know if they're any good though, at that price they won't be the brightest lights ever.  I don't know if it's fully legal but reflective tape seems atleast as bright as reflectors, get a roll of tape from ebay and cover the front (and preferably the rest) of you bike in it and you might not need a reflector built into the light, which would give you more choice."

I've been having a fun time on a Kona Dew that I snagged for free and fixed up with some new parts. I'm all of 40 bucks into the the thing, and it is great.  As for advice, I can't really go on a photo too much, but just give it a good once over. This is a good opportunity to up your skill level in bike mechanics. Give the drivetrain a good cleaning and adjust it. Throw a new chain on, if needed. Check to make sure the wheels are good and true, and spin freely. If not, it's pretty easy to service the bearings and truing a wheel isn't as bad as it seems. Check the bottom bracket bearings. Adjust the brakes. See if it needs new pads too. Beyond that, just check to see if everything is tight. There are tons of youtube videos to help you out.  For tires, I really like Armadillos. I've got them on three of my bikes, and they have been great. I plan to continue using them.  I prefer clipless to the straps, but that's personal preference. SPDs are easy to come by used, if you want to give them a try, and there are a million types of shoes to go with it.  Anyways, welcome to the club!"

Parts have to be adjusted often though, so I had to learn how to fix a lot of things myself, and I gradually upgrade parts, starting with swapping the tires for some Victoria Touring, adding fenders... next step will probably be adding a rear rack for bags. I learned a lot. Would definitely do again."
bikecommuting,3c2d8h,james39,2,Sat Jul 4 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"Very cool,  really like seeing people keeping old, sorta junky bikes going. My first proper bike was a 1974 Schwinn Le Tour that I restored after my ""mountain"" bike I was using to get to college got stolen. Found it in a barn while visiting family in the country, and it had to have been there since about 1975 from the looks of it. Rough, rough shape. But, being broke, a bike was a bike so I took it home to fix it up. It's just a bike, how hard could it be? Ended being a way bigger project than I expected and probably ended up costing more than a new bike in the end. I literally had to fully disassemble and rebuild every single part on the bike. The derailleurs of course were the worst, and truing the wheels was a nightmare, and all of the bearings were absolutely disgusting but eventually I somehow got it back to damn-near-pristine condition. Probably spent 100 hours removing rust and gunk with wire wheels and steel wool, but it was summer break and I had nothing better going on. I spent a ton of time down at the LBS pestering the owner about how stuff works, luckily he was really good natured and helpful about it. Of course it needed new tube/tires, cables, chain, brake pads, bar tape, saddle, and anything else than can dry rot. While I was at it, I took a couple tries at painting it, and eventually got a really nice forest green paintjob on it, with brown bar tape and a brown saddle. It was a beauty, and the first ride on it was such a feeling of accomplishment. Of course, it never was anything special, even after all that work; and it required constant adjustment to keep it going. Loved it, though. That bike gets 100% credit for getting me into cycling, which has changed my life in a lot of ways; and 100% blame for my current garage full of bikes and keeping my wallet consistently empty ever since.

People ""jaywalk"" at mid block because they're not going to walk a significant distance just to comply. Also, people feel, with some justification, that behavior that only endangers themselves is categorically different than that which endangers others.  Consider the way speed limits are commonly set (often at 85th percentile compliance):  ""Public opposition to speed limits being set by an authority, often arise because such agency has been viewed as abusing its power--such as by arbitrary indiscretion or by creating ""speed traps."" Because an expert can theoretically calculate a safer speed limit, than the populace's vote by driving, it is beneficial that local governments preserve strong public trust with their integrity in speed regulation. See A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, AASHTO, 4th Ed., 2001; ISBN 1-56051-156-7""  Research by one Dutch traffic engineer suggested that removing all traffic controls created a safer environment because it removed the illusion of safety.

In a dense city, where the natural human state is to do what ever the fuck you like (for the most part) is simply too powerful an urge, you cannot expect that people will adhere to the VERY modern idea of lights you must wait for to give you permission to move. Look at any old film of street life from the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. The very idea of a waiting for a light to tell you when and where to move took a lot of time and money, and carnage, to instill into American's minds. In cities like New York, the question of whether or not we should obey these nanny lights is still very much an open question on a daily basis. Where the demand for traditional human liberty is high, expect there to be people who stop caring about laws and simply want to keep rolling along.  You also must take into account the fucked up situation on the street most days - all kinds of yahoos blocking the bike lanes, construction, pretty much anarchy on the streets. In that environment, you learn to adapt and simply do what works for you, since that seems to be how most people get around as well. If you're on foot, you do what works for you. If you're in a car, you do what works for you. Guess what happens when you're on a bike, a scooter or a skateboard? Yup. Zero fucks given, you do what works for you.

With the one I have now, I can lock my helmet up with my bike and not worry that it will fall off when it bounces around a bit.

bikecommuting,3bz2od,eggplantsforall,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:30 2015 UTC,I use the second one you mentioned. It's a great mirror and easily detachable if you don't want to wear it. It's very sturdy and easily adjustable and large enough to really show you what's going on.   The only con is that it's large so it looks a little dorky.

bikecommuting,3bz2od,ithika,0,Fri Jul 3 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"Most of this advice was rubbish. You can have as many lights as as much pink lycra as you want and drivers will still steer into you. They drive into walls, fences and other cars after all (including parked ones). You can't force visibility on other people. You just have to preempt every moronic thing they will do. The only thing to know is keep your own eyes peeled, your speed at a level you feel comfortable and always have an escape plan."
bikecommuting,3bz2od,RogerDeanVenture,5,Fri Jul 3 14:05:11 2015 UTC,"You obviously have to be on guard and ride like the article says to, assuming drivers do not see you. This does not mean you shouldn't take all the necessary measure to make yourself seen & heard on the road.   You CAN totally force your visibility on other people. Guess what is easier to see: 1) a cyclist a night wearing a black shirt with no reflectors or lights, or 2) a cyclist at night with flashing lights and a yellow reflector vest. I'm no rocket scientist, but I can sure as hell tell you which one is more likely to be seen and avoided. There is a narrow road near my home that is popular to ride on, but it is unlit at night. On more occasions than I can keep track of I see cyclists at the last second on this dark road because they have no reflectors. I can hardly see them to avoid them and I'm actually looking for them because I know its a popular bike road. If a sober driver can hardly see you, imagine a drunk driver texting. Yeah, force your visibility out there, flashing lights, bright neon reflection vests. Pay attention, ride defensively, and do everything you can to be seen.  The ""only thing to know"" is to do everything possible to keep yourself safe.   Also, Don't fucking scoff at safety & write off tips to stay safe as ""rubbish"" because ""drivers will still steer into you."" This is stuff to take seriously."

I've spent as much time on motorcycles as on bicycles, and the one thing that teaches you is that everything and everybody is out to kill you, and it's your job to anticipate that. Pink lycra and lights may reduce the statistical likelihood of a collision, but ultimately you adopt the attitude that any accident, ANY, is your fault and you should have avoided it. You have to be switched on all the time. Totally backward, I know, but here I am, 53 years old and still going!   Edit: typos because beer."

But even if you can't completely prevent them, if you can decrease their probability by a factor of ten, I'd say it's probably worth doing it. Visibility is very important, and so is situational awareness so that you can react.

To me, dressing in hi-viz/reflective rubbish and lit up like a Christmas tree only serves you in court when the driver tries to claim you 'came outta nowhere!' and you can point at your dress-up to call him out on his BS.    The vast majority of drivers can see cyclists just fine without us dressing in bright yellow. The rest are so blind that they're gonna cause an accident no matter what, so the best thing to do is anticipate being hit/doored/hooked by them and ride in a way that prevents this.

I got a complete Macho Man Disc last month and have put on about 700 miles on it already. First time with disc breaks and I'm not too impressed with the stock Hayes CX Expert brakeset and looking to upgrade.
bikecommuting,3bzzej,ineedtopoopnow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"Hey! I knew as soon as I test rode the stock bike that I'd want a brake upgrade, so I had them put it on right out of the gate. I like the Spyres. They have good stopping power if you really pull the levers, and decent drag with just lightly pulling them. I don't really know how to say it any better than that.  Anyway, my girlfriend just got a Salsa Vaya 2 and I rode it around a bit... I must say I like the Avid BB7s better. I kinda wish I had gone for them. Either that or the TRP HY/RDs, since they're hydraulic, but cable actuated. I made the decision to get the Spyres in the shop at a moment's notice, and I think a bit more research would have benefitted me. That said, the Spyres are much better than the stock brakes. But if I were in that position again, I'd go for BB7s or HY/RDs."

Close to my work they also closed off a street. The sidewalks were expanded to make more room for terraces, they brought over some trees in pots (looks nice, let's see how long it will last). It's nice although the drivers still ignore the new ""access forbidden except busses and bikes"" sign, and pedestrians are super oblivious, as i said before.

bikecommuting,3bz2ip,antarcticgecko,2,Fri Jul 3 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"Not much to observe, really. My commute is pretty boring.  The main road that I use (at least 50% of my commute is on it) is now being torn up and repaved over the next few months. Nightly lane closures (including the bike lane, so I have to take the one open lane), uneven pavement, gravel and bits of asphalt litter the bike lane in the day ... it's a mess. Thankfully the Marathon Pluses I'm rolling on don't mind any of that, but it's still annoying to ride through (and it slows me down)."
bikecommuting,3bz2ip,antarcticgecko,2,Fri Jul 3 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"I've learned that here in Dallas drivers completely ignore you at best and are very aggressive at worst. Like, tailgating and passing with 6 inches kind of aggressive.  Unless you interact with them- scoot to the left of the lane at a stoplight and let them turn right, make small talk when windows are down, wave to children in the back seats, at which point they are unceasingly the nicest people in the world. I'll get compliments on my ride, thanks for using hand signals, short conversations about the commute, ""boy sure is hot today..."" Etc etc etc.   There are no preconceived notions about commuters in my part of town because there simply are none (I've seen three people riding in the road in commuter gear over the past 18 months or so). There are some folks with the fancy road bikes and Lycra out getting exercise but no joes simply going to work so I think we're something of a whimsical novelty to most people.   I think most road rage could be avoided if people kept their windows down and talked once in a while."
bikecommuting,3bz2ip,antarcticgecko,2,Fri Jul 3 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting observation. I lived in the US for 11 years (back in the UK now) and it seems like people don't do stuff if they can afford not to. I'd be the only guy in town who cut his lawn because it was fresh air and exercise (not to save money) - everyone else had a lawn guy. Nobody cycled to the station if they had a car, because car. To the point where I'd get asked if I was cycling because I had a DUI ban, because there couldn't be any other reason."
bikecommuting,3bz2ip,emmquack,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it's all about the easy life and spending time and energy on things other than movement.   The cards are really stacked against active transport here.   First off, climate. High summer generally runs about 100F as a high and 85F as a low, when humidity is factored in it's one of the hottest high population areas of the country. You've really gotta want it.   Second, city development really exploded after ww2 when urban sprawl and cheap land were the name of the game.  Dallas actually used to be called ""Manhattan of the Southwest"" pre-1950 due to it's compact urban core. Not so anymore. Not to say there aren't advantages to this in cost of living and whatnot but it certainly doesn't encourage anything other than a car.   Compound this with a general lack of interest in cycling until recently and the infrastructure is nonexistent everywhere but downtown (it is getting slightly better though).   It's such a car city that everyone drives absolutely everywhere. My buddy, who works out every day and is in great shape, drives to his job- the job that is 1/8 of a mile from his house. No one, I mean no one, thinks this is odd. I didn't used to, it just wasn't something I thought about. Drive to the convenience store at the end of the street, drive to work, drive everywhere, it's just what you do. The only people who walk are people who can't afford a car so there's an attached class status thing too that I don't think people are super willing to admit.   I'm pretty proud for breaking into good habits but I don't expect the city to follow suit anytime soon.  I get completely baffled looks when I tell people I cycled even 2 miles to work. Keep on truckin'."

So, on March 30, 2014, I changed my life.  When I started, I weighed 253 pounds.  This was not my heaviest.  At one time, I weighed 285 pounds.  I picked my goal weight of 165 lbs because it was what I weighed in 1989, when I got married.  I started tracking my calories using My Fitness Pal, and the weight started to come off.  On July 4, 2014, I bought a bicycle.  I walked into REI and walked out a few minutes later with a hybrid bike.  I started riding it every day until I felt I was strong enough to commute to work.  On August 2, 2014, I started commuting to work (10-21 miles per day, with one sizable hill, depending on the route).  I haven't missed a day commuting since 9/4/2014, and Thursday, July 2, marks my 200th commute since I started!  In addition, I do a lot of weekend rides, and I have finished 16 ""century"" rides since October 2014, including thirteen in the last thirteen weeks -- one per week!  A year ago, I couldn't ride three miles without collapsing in exhaustion.  http://imgur.com/a/QMb0a"

My experience has been that i've gone from 235->218 or so.. just from a year of commuting and eating whatever I want (~120 miles/week). In the last month or so, i've been doing a lot more exercise on the weekends (hiking) and watching my food intake a little and i'm down to 212. My lesson from that, which is backed up by science is that for weight loss past a certain point, you either need to do massive amounts of fitness (ie like OP, century ride each weekend - ie 100 miles of commuting doesn't count) or you need to change what you eat - or both.  The extra work on the weekends. Ie longer rides or hikes, runs, whatever really push the fitness level and weight loss.  Really inspiring stuff, Gandalf the Fit. :)"

The lens rotates so you can put the body of the camera flat up against your helmet.  Unlike the Contour Roam cameras, it actually works at night.  The Innovv C3 is just about the slickest thing on the market but, while the lens is waterproof, the recorder isn't.  If you can provide battery power and a waterproof container for the C3 it's basically the best thing on the market.  The shitty battery life and lack of waterproofing is a GIGANTIC downside though.  But man...... that remote lens is so fucking sweet.  I keep having to remind myself not to order one 'cause I don't want to fabricate a waterproof box."

bikecommuting,3byttr,MASSIVEcock_7391,3,Fri Jul 3 07:06:02 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a 650b/27.5"" bike for winter cycling.  You want studded tires and your choices for studded tires that size is extremely limited: they exist but you're going to have to spend time tracking them down.  The best bet for the amount of snow you guys get would be importing a set of Ice Spikers from the UK at $110 each (they're about $170 each in the US).  The 650b Nokian A10 that Peter White sells is meant for clear, plowed roads that may have occasional patches of ice.  Get something with 700c or 29"" tires if you want a year round bike.  Consider picking up a cheap 26"" beater off CL as a dedicated winter bike.  The tires are cheap and wide."
bikecommuting,3byttr,DonOblivious,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saving me for a potentially catastrophic purchase.  I did some research and changed which bike I'm planning to get (pending reddit's approval).  Doing so has changed which set of fenders I need due to fit, so I would appreciate it if you or anyone could chime in and confirm that this combination will all fit:   Bike:  http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/mountain_bikes/529ht_29er_mountainbikes.htm  Fenders: (the 29"" black ones)   https://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=20900&category=1793  Rack:   http://www.amazon.com/Topeak-Explorer-Bicycle-Brake-Mounts/dp/B000FIAVHE  Also, are studded tires absolutely necessary?  My daily commute will be 4ish miles each way, and supposedly Rochester does a great job at plowing (but I don't know this for certain).  If so, can you recommend any cheaper ones? Do studded tires need to be taken off after winter is over?"
bikecommuting,3byttr,DonOblivious,2,Sat Jul 4 04:37:35 2015 UTC,"Also, are studded tires absolutely necessary?   [tl;dr: basically? yes]  No, but I really banged the shit out of my ribs until I bought them. Do you have any idea how fucking bad a bruised/cracked/broken rib hurts?  Or for how long it hurts?  There's very little you can do about the pain.  You will hurt for months.  That's not an exaggeration, it will be painful to sleep, or roll over or maybe even laugh for quite a while.  See, the thing is with studded tires; they're seasonal and niche.  If you try out winter biking without them and decide you really do need them it might be hard to find them in stock because of all the other folks in the exact same situation.  Folks think they can get by without them when it's just snow on the ground but once it gets icy they start shopping for studs.  The tire companies don't make them year round.  The first time I looked at buying them the shop told me ""we have one left in your size (700c).""  That's not great: you really want two and it's good to have a variety of choices so you can pick one suitable to your local conditions.  Local conditions: it's really fucking important.  I can't stress that enough.  The dudes I know in Colorado suggest completely different tires than the locals here in Minnesota and I'm pretty sure a guy like you in upstate New York needs a different tire than I do in Minneapolis.  I get by with Maraton Winters but it has a very low tread block: I'm fairly sure a guy in your area is going to need a really tall tread block 'cause you get deeper snow.  Those Ice-Spikers I mentioned earlier look good for what I imagine your winters are like.  There are some cheaper almost-as-knobby tires you could look at.  There's nothing that beats just asking winter commuters in your area what sort of tire they use.  You don't need studs for snow, in fact studs won't help you at all in snow, but even a little bit of ice under the snow can ruin your day.  What you need for thick snow is wide tires with nice tall knobs.  (That's what I don't have with my 2mm tread block Marathon Winters) (Denver dudes can ""pizza cutter"" through their snow with super-skinny tires)  You're on the right track with the fenders, I think.  Full fenders like that keep the muck and salt off your bike.  And your shoes.  I can't emphasise how much it rules to keep slush and snow from hitting your shoes and numbing your toes.  ""Mud Guards"" won't do that.   I don't know how well those fenders will work with a suspension fork.  We constantly tell people not to buy bikes with suspension forks here in /r/bikecommuting .  They're mostly counterproductive unless you actually plan on going offroad.  I don't mean ""ride trails and gravel roads"" sort of offroad I mean like singletrack mountainbike courses.  This and this aren't roads that require suspension....you have elbows.  Unless you're tackling stuff harder than that, on a regular basis, you should put your money into a better bike instead of spending it on a suspension fork.  ""A good fork will cost your entire budget..."""

There was this traffic light turning yellow, so I stood up to pedal harder and pass through before it turned red (also bad decision).   Immediately after I passed the light I had to turn left. As I was coming in relative speed, I naturally leaned down at least 20 degrees while I rode over a recently painted cross walk. It was really slippery.   The next thing I remember I was laying on my chest, both pedals unclipped, knees bleeding but thankfully nothing more serious happened. No fractures, my head didn't hit anything (so I don't need to replace the helmet). So I got up and started checking the bike and realized the issues I listed in the OP.

Abso-fucking-lutely; even though you know it won't likely alter their shitty behaviour.  Keep following the road rules, though. As cynical as it sounds, in the event something does happen, you don't want to jeopardise your ability to claim against a driver because you were doing something you shouldn't have been doing (red lights would be the most obvious example, I guess).   As for the camera, it's probably best to have one for commuting. Hopefully you'll never need to use the footage, but I guess it's best to have one (I certainly do)."

Cyclists have a fear of serious injury or death when a car is driven aggressively, inconsistently or just too plain close. That fear causes a strong fight or flight response, which often comes out as anger.   When I drive a car behind a motorcycle, I am a bit tentative because I fear the biker falling in my path. So I have some incentive to not be behind one. Maybe that guy felt that way about being behind you, so he took advantage to get out from behind you.

Just like you can recognize certain ""body language"" cues from drivers (like adjustments to speed that indicate they probably want to change lanes, but are too dumb to use their turn signal), you start recognizing those things from people riding bikes as well.

Is there any way to avoid this particularly dangerous route? There is no need to die over six feet, the same logic applies to a mile or any other distance that would take this particularly dangerous sequence of lights out of your route."

Yes, he was trying not to miss the lights because of me, but he didn't base this on my previous performance on making progress as i had left him for dead at the last set of lights. I just think he was pissed that a cyclist dared to use the road as a normal unit of traffic, rather than be sat in the gutter. This episode has its origins in the sticking - plaster approach my city has took in providing cycleways .  I was on the cycleway upto this point but thats where the cycleway magically vanishes. Its either use the road, or the footpath. One is legal, the other isnt, hence my observation that staying legal and alive on a bike isnt easy!  Is there another way? Not really. The location here is a bridge across a river. All other crossings further downstream are the same.  Its been a good thing. I've seen how insane driving a car can make you and I've not been injured in the process.   Still, i may just ride on the pavement next time. Being illegal is better than being dead, isnt it.  Oh, one more thing, the crossing of the white line is very relevant. Its a bridge and traffic is tight going through it. The line is solid for a good reason. Going completely (ie fully into the oncoming traffic) is a good indicator of just where this car driver was. It wasn't a happy place for sure!"

I was worried that, in a dangerous situation, at least a part of me would be focusing on how great it was that I had a camera, and how much trouble the offending party would be in once I handed the video over to police.

bikecommuting,3brmh2,awesometographer,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with this. If I want to go camping or up to the mountains, I'll drive. Going carless for me is simply not a reasonable choice. Day to day, I rarely drive, and those miles really add up, so stick with basic tracking (miles ridden/miles driven, maybe note the weather or reason if you drive somewhere you'd normally ride). Just understand that cars DO have a practical use and place in the day to day lives of most people and while reduction is great, it's doesn't make someone morally superior because they don't have a car or never drive."
bikecommuting,3brmh2,user_1729,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"The difference between being 100% car-free and mostly car free is about $2,000 per year for insurance plus the car costs a lot too.  My parents currently pay my insurance, but once I am on my own I hope to be 100% car-free or use zipcar when I want to go hiking."
bikecommuting,3brmh2,apul_madeekaud,3,Wed Jul 1 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"Wow insurance is really high for kids these days. My insruance is ~$550/year plus ~$75 registration $12.50 smog check ($25 every other year). Since I drive about ~4500 miles that is one oil change at ~$30 (I do it myself but get the good stuff), and that's about $650 in gas. I guess if you just use the IRA 55c a mile the $2k is a reasonable number for a year of car ownership, but even the $166/month is pretty low for having an incredible machine at my disposal.  Either way, my lifestyle is significantly more convenient owning a car, I use Car2go around town when convenient. If I never used the car, and just kept insurance/reg I would only spend the $550 +$75, and even that is pretty insignificant for someone with steady income. My point is that it's pretty easy to rationalize owning a car in the united states, especially in the west. I just don't like the moral superiorty rap that goes along with driving less/none.   I can almost guarantee that a vast majority of the city dwelling carless people would get a car if they lived in an area that wasn't prohibitive to car ownership. I hope car2go, zipcar and ego carshare pick up more, but right now they just don't work for me and again, owning a car can be fairly cheap and care free."

Biking ended up cutting my commute time in half, dropping my monthly expenditure from $76 a month for a monthly subway pass to about $20 for anything I've bought for my bike to upgrade/maintain/repair it, and overall it's made me feel better since I'm also getting aerobic exercise, something I didn't have time for if I took the subway in."

Don't leave big gaps when you secure with the u-lock.  One of the main ways to break a u-lock is jamming a car jack in a gap and prying the thing apart.  Also, a great place to store the cable lock is by coiling it around the top tube up at the front by the head tube, then wrap the last loop with the lock out around the down tube.

bikecommuting,3bmj5o,RampageUT,5,Tue Jun 30 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"I biked for a year in Beijing without issue. I bought a very cheap commuter bike there, and wouldn't recommend anything expensive - unless things have changed substantially since I was there 8 years ago (which is entirely possible, knowing China), bike theft is a very large issue. It's also unlikely you'll be able to move fast; speed is dictated by how fast your fellow commuters are moving, not by your equipment.  Bike helmets aren't popular but I'd still recommend wearing one. Be the change!  Edit: To answer your questions, I would definitely buy something in China, not at home. I would aim mid to low grade. There are lots of local bike shops - see if you can't have a Chinese friend or colleague find one for you that sells more than the uber-cheap commuter bikes that most folks use."

bikecommuting,3blauz,james39,2,Tue Jun 30 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"The Trucker is for sure more of a touring bike, but the Cross Check can pull it's weight there as well in my experience. I chose it because it does have a bit more of a road stance to it and seemed a bit more agile, but it's also got awesome tire clearance for putting my big beefy CX tires on it for off road use. It seems perfectly happy loaded up, but most of the time I'm not touring and only carrying a couple light-ish panniers so it made sense for me to get something with a bit more versatility than a straight up touring rig. The Cross Check does have all of the braze ons you need to do anything heavy duty that the Trucker does, and I think it does it nearly as well, while doing the non-heavy-touring stuff a bit better. I don't think I'd be riding single track on a LHT. Seemed like a good balance to me, but bike selection is a pretty personal thing and your needs may vary."

I like the QL3 system especially when paired with a Tubus Minimal QL3 rack - notice the buttons are part of the rack's frame? It really doesn't get any lighter or more bulletproof than this when you want waterproof and good carrying capacity.  I had a problem with QL3 initially where one of the buttons on the add-on mount kit that came with my Office Bag broke - the plastic button just wasn't strong enough to handle the constant bumping of a heavy bag. (The Ortlieb panniers have a nice large reflective patch, but the entire high-vis Office Bag lights up in headlights while looking like a normal carbon/charcoal bag in daylight.) I expect if I get around to reporting it they will just send me a new button or mount kit for free but the metal mount on the rack is just too good, I think I will buy another Minimal for my other bike.   A big advantage of QL3 is that you can carry the bag (off the bike) without it having mounts sticking out from the bag, digging into your leg as you carry it. Often I just take the Office Bag even if I am not riding the bike as it doesn't look like that bike-specific."

My wife has a pair of these that I used pretty regularly for almost a year, and they're pretty nice. The problem with the soft fabric back and the horizontal strip for the lower hooks, though, is that racks tend to have a bolt at the bottom connecting them to the top of the stay bolted on to the frame, and this bolt, because it protrudes a little bit into the bag, wears a hole in the soft fabric backing of the bag fairly quickly. If you decide to get them, you should first make sure that they have no pressure points where they rest against the rack so they don't wear out quickly.  Any bolts that are protruding now can probably be replaced with button-head allens."

Ortleib panniers are superbly made but were too small fir my needs (I needed big panniers for touring on a tandem) so I shopped around and got some altura dryline 56s, which confusingly have no been renamed Orkneys, drylines are now a slightly cheaper model)  which were the biggest waterproof panniers I could find at the time. Turns out they're great for everyday use as well, one dryline has the capacity of a pair of back rollers (I got a 40L back of compost in each one the other week), so you can get plenty of stuff and some shopping in a single pannier and one pannier is much easier to handle off the bike. The big pocket is also really useful and makes it much easier to access your wallet, keys, phone... than single compartment panniers like ortliebs. Mine have seen almost daily use for 7 years now and whilst they're definitely showing their age there's some life in them yet.  Altura's are still pretty pricey though, a significantly cheaper alternative is the Lomo pannier that I saw recently, I've never used the pannier but I have bought several drybags from lomo and they're very well made. The hardware isn't as good as on ortlieb or altura bags but still looks pretty good and your can't really complain for £60 a pair."

These guys should be leading from the front. Cycling really needs to get with the program. If you are going to use a road or path as a cyclist, then you should be following the rules of that road path like everyone else does.

Some pedals have one flat side and one side that takes a cleat, so you could ride it in whatever shoes you wanted to wear.

We registered for a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't even remotely ""housewares"" - a bike trailer, climbing harnesses, board games and hot sauce along with a few upgrade housewares (fancy blender, giant teapot) and got nearly everything we requested.  Nobody thought we were rude, and many said they were very pleased that we showed our personalities in our registry and gave them the option to give more personal gifts.

bikecommuting,3bf1ff,LuxoJr93,2,Sun Jun 28 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"For a new bike, see what brands are sold through your LBS.  With a purchase, you would get some level of ongoing support (cable adjustments, etc).  Buying a brand from out of town, no dice.  I commute where it can be considered flat and recommend that you stay away from a single gear bike.  Over time, the wind will vary in both speed and direction.  I deal with head and tail winds that sometimes are 15+ MPH with gusts well into the 20's.  Windy conditions are also reason to get drop bars, lowering your profile will reduce wind drag (I have multiple bikes and find I rarely use my flat bar bike, drops see most of the mileage).  Also, although it is rather flat, I have a couple of overpasses on my route."
bikecommuting,3bf1ff,fdtc_skolar,0,Sun Jun 28 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"What are the roads like, is it smooth asphalt, or is it bumpy with potholes? That makes a difference as far as what style of bike and size of tire you want to get exactly. If it's rougher I'd maybe go for a hybrid, if it is nice and smooth you can go more road. The smoother it is you can go with thinner, faster tires.  As far as bars, I wouldn't recommend drop handlebars because if you get bumped by a car they can get caught on the cars mirror and drag you. There are lots of good options for handlebars though, that just depends on preference but I like the bullhorn.   If you really want light and fast too you could go for a single speed bike since you said it is a flat ride. It makes maintenance and repairs easier and cheaper as well. You can set it up as a fix gear or with a coaster hub like a normal geared bike. I have mine set up to coast because I like to coast from time to time and occasionally go down a hill I don't wanna pedal the whole way down. But if I want I can flip my rear tire and make it a fixie."
bikecommuting,3bf1ff,ImaginarySpider,2,Sun Jun 28 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"It's actually 90% off road on trail paths, and they're pretty smooth except where there is a little construction.

Also, bikes that don't have mounts for a rack are generally not meant to carry weight like that. I think you have the wrong bike if you want to mount a rack.

Stand up and get it started again; that's call bike commuting.  Beyond that, I'm really not sure what the point of this article is, as it jumps around a lot. The 56% number is in Beijing; how does that apply to his examples in America? He says:   In America, about 865,000 cyclists commuted to work each day. More than half of them charge across a red light intersection, according to one recent study.    The word ""them"" here implies that it refers to the 865,000 cyclists commuting to work each day in America. But the link is to a study in Beijing. Have you been to Beijing? I think 50% of cars run red lights in Beijing. :O  I don't know what kind of city this guy lives in, but in Toronto there sure as hell aren't 56% of cyclists running red lights. And, in places where there is proper cycling infrastructure (like cycle tracks), the vast majority of cyclists obey the law. Along the lines of the article: the ""risk taking"" people are the ones also least likely to go a few minutes out of their way for a cycletrack, so you'll see less of these people there.  But back to the article: what's the point? To try to demonize those awful ""cyclists"" who are clearly just out for an adrenaline rush, while all those safety-conscious ""drivers"" are out there just trying to get on with their day, absent of extreme sports?"

I really hate this argument too. When you stop in a car you're burning gasoline and not going anywhere, and your fuel efficiency plummets during your deceleration and then subsequent acceleration back up to speed. The 'energy inefficient' argument can be made for all types of vehicles. If your only counter-argument is 'but cyclists have to use their own muscles and get more tired as a result,' well, isn't that kinda what we sign up for by bike commuting? It's active transportation."
bikecommuting,3b75pi,noisette915,6,Fri Jun 26 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, both transport types have a loss in kinetic energy, but for cyclists the kinetic energy is more precious. We have less reserves of potential energy, and a limited number of high-effort exertions available. Therefore, we lose more seconds per stop either by much slower acceleration or by accelerating with a high exertion level and reducing your climbing/acceleration capabilities later in the commute.   In addition, the size, limited speed, and open nature of bicycles makes it easier to observe and avoid traffic while running lights.   It makes perfect sense to say that bicyclists have much more incentive to run lights than cars do. There is both less risk and greater reward than there would be for an automobile driver."

When a cyclist turns right, from the shoulder of the road, it does not conflict with a vehicle traveling through in the intersecting road.   Same goes for stop signs."

Every time I'm at a red light a check the pavement for screws and toss them out of the road or take them home to the trash.  I like to think of that as a nice trade off.

People notice a helmet mount and it could make the difference in keeping an idiot from doing something stupid and terrible like what happened to your wife.  You don't need a wide angle since you're aiming it where you look.  With a wide angle lens you need to be closer to read details like registration plate numbers.

Helmet mount is nice but the wideness of the field of view of most of these cameras negates the need for it. Of course if it comes down to a confrontation with a driver leaving the car and getting in your face helmet cam is great!  Hope this helps you selecting  a camera and I  hope your wife feels better!"

bikecommuting,3b46ds,RVABikeGent,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:15:54 2015 UTC,I use a Fly6 for rear and a Contour Roam 2 for helmet.
bikecommuting,3b46ds,IMBoddy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think a forward mounted camera would be better than rear. First, you can turn your head quickly and capture what you need. Next if it's forward facing only it will show what you were doing and where you were riding so you can show you're obeying the bicycle laws and incidents are not your fault."

I didn't make that comment purely based on the video, I lived and biked there for a 3 month period a few years ago and it insanely dangerous. Not to mention the general attitudes from people and the politicians ""supporting"" bike infrastructure. I showed up to a critical mass ride and there were more cops than cyclists present. The city makes no money off of cyclists as opposed to the overwhelming majority who use public transportation."

bikecommuting,3b2lhl,fetamorphasis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"I did two years there getting around via saddle & U lock myself. When cycling (being outside in general) became more important to us than bars, early thirties, we moved.   The city makes no money off of cyclists as opposed to the overwhelming majority who use public transportation.   I disagree with you on this. Cycling fills in a lot of the gaps in the subways & busses to help prop up gentrification in places like Red Hook or the unreliable L & G lines.   10 years ago, that small percentage of the city that bike-commutes was ""proof"" that the outer boroughs were a ""good"" investment. Like the people right on the other side of the bridges, ten years prior to that.   One might even say the advent of urban cycling has stunted arguments for MTA growth & falsely inflated property values in under-served areas. Those marginally convenient, shouldn't-quite-be bearable 20 minute walk  to the train neighborhoods with mansion prices.   And I think if you look at the Hudson Valley or Jersey or the various shore communties, this bears out. The oldest, main-streetsiest towns, the ones with very-active cycling populations & a general lack of sprawl, tend to be more desirable than their 50's through 80's era suburban counterparts."

bikecommuting,3b2lhl,jacybear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it's kind of a matter of opinion. I feel like new york has more bike lanes, more dedicated bike paths, and way more protected bike lanes (portland has none.)  For the past couple years, there's also been more of a critical mass of bikers in new york, which to me is what makes the biggest difference. To be fair, I never commuted during rush hour in portland, so my perception of this might be skewed.   Also, even on big streets in new york--yeah it's really scary, but if you get used to it, you can bike in traffic pretty safely since the cars just don't go that fast. In portland, no way--big streets are like freeways.   That said, a lot of parts of portland feel much nicer to bike in, since there are very few cars in the residential streets. Of course parts of brooklyn are like that too."
bikecommuting,3b2lhl,keevie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess I feel safer when I bike in Portland because, while there may not be as many bike lanes, there are many, many designated bike routes and drivers are generally less aggressive and more accommodating with regards to cyclists."
bikecommuting,3b2lhl,jacybear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"I agree--if they see you. Drivers in portland strike me as timid and accommodating of you--but not particularly competent, which is much scarier to me, especially since people will go much faster than in new york."

bikecommuting,3b2lhl,BBnet3000,5,Thu Jun 25 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain here and disagree. NYC has an excellent network of bike lanes to the point where you rarely have to share the road with cars. There is plenty of bike racks. Sure traffic is congested, but it's generally slow moving so it's not as dangerous. It's chaotic, but predictably chaotic (this applies to all transportation in the city really). There are a lot of cyclist on the roads and it creates a culture of acceptance rather than hostility from drivers.  I've biked in a lot of US cities: Chicago, Denver, Pittsburgh, and my hometown of Los Angeles to name a few. I'd take NYC over all these places in a heartbeat.  Just my 2 cents."

The best is Tubus - in the USA they are sold by Ortlieb, in Australia through various dealers but I have bought mine through Abbotsford Cycles.  They are adjustable, solid, quiet, lightweight and they work very well with the Ortlieb panniers and office bag that I use. I've never had one break. They have a nice durable black powder coat. There are cheaper racks but all compromise in some way, all the others were just wasted money.   You spent realistic money on panniers, why compromise with the rack? I know you said you don't want to spend more than $40 but I don't think you'll like what you find at that price point."

bikecommuting,3b4otj,SirSmalls,2,Thu Jun 25 23:58:17 2015 UTC,"I've got a Tubus and I can say I'll probably never need another rack. That said, your budget is not prohibitive in the least. I got many miles out of my Planet Bike EcoRack, but I would recommend one step up, something like the Axiom Journey. You've already made the right call with quality panniers, and honestly that goes a long way."
bikecommuting,3b4otj,howmanydads,2,Fri Jun 26 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"I've had good experiences with the low-end Blackburn racks, most recently an XR-1 on my commuter and an EX-1 on a mountain bike. I think the EX-1 would better fit your bike (it looks like your bike uses 26"" wheels), and should be about 35-40 bucks new.  You may want to look for a rack that has additional loops on the rear side (like on this example) as it can make it easier to attach panniers securely."
bikecommuting,3b4otj,onseali,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend something like that. I have a rack that doesn't have those extra loops, and my bags have a tendency to go into the wheel until I bend them back.

It also seems to be constructed to put the panniers a couple inches further back than other racks which is nice if you are worried about heel strike.  Lastly it has those side bars for attaching your panniers which is convenient if you want to strap somethihng to the top of the rack.  It's pretty solid for the price.
bikecommuting,3b4pn9,ferrarisnowday,3,Thu Jun 25 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"The CO2 cartridges are reliable.  However, they aren't metered, so once you start, you have to finish.  That makes it a little tricky to put on a new tube, because it will be totally flat.  A lot of people use a hand pump to give the tube some shape first, install it, then fully inflate with the CO2.  Also, it's a little hard to estimate how much pressure you're putting in.  Note that I've never had to use one, this is all second hand knowledge."
bikecommuting,3b4pn9,ideoillogical,2,Thu Jun 25 23:52:44 2015 UTC,I think some of them allow you to keep the cartridge on if you don't use it all.

bikecommuting,3b4pn9,s3rious_simon,2,Fri Jun 26 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"A pair of puncture-resistant tires, like Vittoria Randonneur Pros, is well worth it to save yourself from the hassle of a flat tire. Even then, it's worth it to carry a spare inner tube and frame pump. I wear glasses/contacts too and, unfortunately, I have yet to come up with a better solution than yours. :P Ponchos work, but can get pretty hot. If you have the money, a lightweight rain shell with a hood is a wonderful thing. As far as bottoms go, though, it can still get annoying - I don't know if there are rain shells for over pants, but that would be worth looking into. Alternately, get a pair of moisture-wicking athletic shorts and a change of clothing (including socks and underwear), change at work, and hang the wet shorts up to dry. Same with shoes - they make rain booties you can use, or just keep a spare pair at work you can change into. Rain makes drivers stupid. I have yet to discover why.   Good luck!"

Knee Over Pedal measurement isn't necessarily a hard rule for any bike. It's kind of an old bike fitting measurement that's nowhere near a primary measurement anymore.

I don't often ride with panniers, but when I do I'm carrying a fucktonne and as the rack is only recommended to carry 10kg (2.2 lbs) I don't have a fun time.  I have a Rove 2, which was my commuter until it got stolen (hence the BSO purchase) I got it back with a destroyed cassette, but after riding the BSO I now really want a lighter bike.

Sounds kinda like what you're after (though I don't actually know if it's lighter than the Kona... I think so, otherwise there's always the carbon models!). Road bike with space for 32mm or so tyres, racks, fenders... commutes well, should tour well too (front and rear rack mounts), speedy on good roads, and handles a bit of trail (though not with default tyres I reckon).  Like I said I'm a big fan but would probably be similarly happy on a Trek 720, Specialized Secteur, and I think Giant has a couple of similar bikes (Revolt maybe?), and GT Grade (though more limited on racks).

If I wanted to commute through the winter, I would probably need a third bike.     Having the second bike is well worth it. I've easily made up for the cost of it on maintenance that wasn't required on my good bike because it gets treated well.

Starting and stopping at intersections is more or less instinctive (and I'm fortunate that on a good day I can go door to door without ever unclipping) but it's still just slightly inconvenient should I ever need to walk around and not clip-clop in cleats (broke my chain once and walked a few km in socks) and there's a hesitation off the line that I don't like.

That said, right now I'm using Pedro's Synlube which has been really good in all weather commuting, not noisy, and not nearly so prone to breaking down into a wet black sludge that'd stick to any clothing that looked like it might touch it like the ceramic lube I tried before did, so, I'd say as long as you steer away from ceramics and stick to a normal lube like what your shop suggested you should be OK.

bikecommuting,3azoek,changinthangs,2,Wed Jun 24 21:48:19 2015 UTC,I have considered those. I may take advantage of the REI return policy and test them out. Thanks.
bikecommuting,3azoek,gummylick,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely! My commute is 8 miles each way and adding GP2s made a huge difference on my hybrid. No more palm soreness or tingling.  Another thing to try - adjust your stem height (easy, moving a few spacer rings usually) and see if the angle helps.  I tried it on mine but in the end the gp2s  worked."

bikecommuting,3azoek,Kahnza,2,Wed Jun 24 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people's hands ache if their bars are too low meaning excessive pressure is put on the hands, so you could try raising your stem if you have any spacers above it or fitting a higher stem.  Popular options for bars which give you alternate hand positions are bar ends, Trekking bars or north road bars. None of which should involve the expense of new shifters or levers. North Road bars are very comfortable and can be mounted the opposite way up as in the photo giving a more upright position, trekking bars give you lots of positions (though may require to fit a longer stem) and bar ends a simple to fit. Trekking and north road bars aren't expensive but may require you to redo your cabling which can be a bit of a faff.   I've fitted north road bars to my dads bike as he found a flat bar uncomfortable, I had to redo the cabling (the shifters and levers are further away from the bike) and change the shifters (this would have been expensive if I hadn't been able to switch them with my mum's shifters) as the bulky gear indicators on his shifters interfered with the curve of the bars. The resulting riding position is really comfortable and he's very happy with the bike now. I fitted trekking bars to my town bike (an early 90s mtb) and I'm happy with the results, the only complication was the need to fit an unusually long stem to prevent the steering being overly twitchy when in the most upright position. In each case I got zoom brand bars from amazon for under £20."
bikecommuting,3azm8z,beancounter2885,5,Wed Jun 24 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"I think the official tire of Reddit is the Conti Gatorskin, but I've heard great things about the Schwalbe Marathon and Marathon Supremes as well.   Right now, I'm using a Thickslick Sport 700x28c in the rear and it's been a little over 2500mi without a flat (according to Strava). I'm in LA though, so no goatheads or anything, but it stands up to potholes, glass, and I'm sure I must've hit a street sweeping dealie at some point.  I have a bog standard Kenda Kwest up front (stock with the bike) and that's been a bit under 2500 flat-free too, so I may just be lucky. I am pretty vigilant about checking the pressure which helps avoid pinch flats too. Good luck!"
bikecommuting,3azm8z,SwedishChef727,3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like every tire thread I read involves Schwalbe Marathon's as the most recommended tire. I broke the Schwalbe/Conti mold and went with Vittoria Randonneur's in 700x32 for my commuter and 700x28 for my courier bike. Between my two bikes, I probably have between 1000-1200 miles on them (if not more) with no issues. I got these based on a recommendation from a courier friend who has been running them for years with no problems. I ride them in the city, on trails, in snow/rain, etc."
bikecommuting,3azm8z,googleyeye,2,Thu Jun 25 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Gatorskins, Marathons, Marathon Supremes, and Randonneurs are all great tires to stop flats.  If that doesn't work, throw in some Slime tubes and StopFlats 2 tire liners.  If that doesn't work you're just fucked."

If you're looking to make some high quality lock picks they are almost the perfect raw material since the dimension fits beautifully in the keyway of common locks above the guard channels.  I'm not sure if this is what you have sticking in your tire but at the expense of a little extra weight (and to me harsher ride) the Schwalbe Marathons are probably the ultimate defence. I have one of these, on an electric bike that would be really hard to change on the road. The rest of my tires are all Vittoria Randonneur Hyper - replaced in the Vittoria range now with the almost-identical Voyager Hyper - and I haven't had one flat on those either, eight years now*.

Our shop doesn't have a huge store front and we keep most of our bikes in separated rooms in the attic, meaning, sometimes things get a little bit lost.  Once you get your size, which is probably somewhere between a 52 and a 58, though each frame is really different, check to see if they can give you a list of what they've got.

I would start at some of those to check out sizing and get familiar with what is available. If nothing is striking you, or you like certain things but they're out of your price range, start to search on craigslist for older and used models."

(And you can do it along some parts of the 5 that parallel the LA River bike path!) But those parts are the difficult parts, where you'd have to watch out for offramps every half mile or so.  Multi-use trails along the main spines of the interstates would not get as much use though - there are surely some people who would appreciate the opportunity to backpack for long distances, but the number of people that are willing to bike 100 miles in a day is not that large. Not like the number of people that would bike if we just had cycletracks along the major arterial boulevards in each city."

In vast parts of the USA the interstates are literally the only direct connection between two locations. I had sections out west where you're allowed on the interstate because it is literally the only road.   In Mass, where highways overlay a huge road network, there are plenty of areas where a ride-along bike path would be orders of magnitude faster than the secondary roads.  It also opens up easy to navigate longer distance rides at high speeds."

Adding cycle lanes to them would not, and all it would mean is constant complaints from cyclists when there's shit in them.  There are limits to what's reasonable, and until there's more incentive to do this it's not going to happen.

bikecommuting,3awy7x,heapcorruption,2,Wed Jun 24 04:47:39 2015 UTC,Yep! Any W&OD specific commuting tips?  Are there any Maryland bikers?  ;-)
bikecommuting,3awy7x,heapcorruption,2,Wed Jun 24 04:54:55 2015 UTC,Nothing but the obvious. Stop at intersections and pay attention. Belmont ridge most drivers dont stop so be alert. Reston sterling slmost everyone stops so its easy. 2 bottles of water 1 frozen for hot days on the ride home. Outside that take in the scenery. Reston herndon can get slittle packed in the am but most stick to the sides.
bikecommuting,3awy7x,heapcorruption,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:04:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know the trail for casual rides and I often rollerblade about 20mi. (maybe once a week or so). I was wondering about commuter specific details. Does it have a rush hour? Regular groups? I hear that they actually clear the trail in the winter (at least out west) - how about the rest of it? How is it after dark (during the darker months, not middle of the night) -- ever feel unsafe?"
bikecommuting,3awy7x,heapcorruption,2,Wed Jun 24 10:15:27 2015 UTC,"So i have only been commuting about a month so i cant answer all these questions. I tend to bike around 8am, from leesburg, and get to reston around 9am. Leesburg is pretty bare, a couple of riders here and there, but mostly pretty isolated. Really really nice morning you will see a few more runners and cyclists, but nothing that i would call rush hour.  Once you hit herndon and reston it can get pretty crowded. Really nice days there can be alot of commuters, and alot of them are ""sunday"" cyclists, meaning they can go pretty slow. So you will be passing a few. And you will get people who get in your way and mess up your cadence...but that just goes with the path.  On the way home, i usually am at reston around 5pm and in leesburg around 6pm and its pretty much the same. Reston/herndon can have a few riders/runners. Nicer the day the more people there are. You could see yourself sitting at intersections with a crowd of upto 5 cyclists. Again i wouldnt call it rush hour, just a crowd. Further west you get the more isolated it gets. Also the further west you get the more friendly the people get. Alot more people say hi, wave, smile etc. Its more isolated but i feel more safe just cause of the smiles.  Biggest group i have seen is maybe 3-4. Nothing more than that. You will see alot of pair riding, but rarely anything over 3 in a group. There is a group of walkers that are 6 or so, and they tend to walk in the middle of the road. They are by far the biggest pain, cause they dont care how much you say ""left"" or ring your bell, they are in their own world. And they get mad when you pass them. But honestly f-them. I see them in the morning around sterling/herndon border. They just walk shoulder to shoulder messes up everyone regardless of which direction you are heading. I dont know how the trail is in the winter or night, cause the light is out so late these days and i have only been riding for a month. But after a big rain storm like last night, you will see alot of branches/leaves on the road....by afternoon its all gone, so if that is any indication they are  pretty vigilante about cleaning the path for everyone. I see a guy mowing the grass maybe once a week, he is pretty friendly and stops when he sees runners/bicycles coming his way.  As for safety. I am male so most people tend to leave me alone. I have heard alot of stories about people flashing girls, and in rare cases dragging them into the woods. But i have never witnessed it, and i dont know anyone who has. So i dont know how often this happens or how accurate it is. But because of these stories i carry a knife just incase, and if you are or anyone is female i would recommend mace or pepper spray. I dont think you will need it, but better safe than sorry. Hopefully nobody needs it. Knife is also a good idea incase you see anyone in trouble, can always help as much as possible. Again I dont see many people in the leesburg ashburn leg of the path, and herndon/reston there are so many people...so i would imagine any safety issues would be in ashburn leesburg, jsut cause of crowd issues. But alot of golf course workers are around and casual riders/runners so who knows. Maybe safety is more of an issue in winter or darker times, i dont know. I am still pretty new. Also in the morning you will on rare occasions see people walking dogs without a leash....that is annoying. Most of the dogs are pretty well trained so no issue, but some people are just stupid and think the world revolves around them. If they dont stop the dog as you are approaching keep you hand on the brakes cause you might need it, i did once.  Honestly the commute is alot easier than i thought it would be. Hills are flat, there are water stations and bathroom stations through out. I would only use the bathroom in emergencies, kind of dirty. Water stations at the schools are pretty clean and cold, so huge plus.  Not sure whta else i can tell you....except you will love it. I do...beats rt7 by lightyears."

I'd either not be paying attention to the ride well enough or not be hearing the music or podcast all that well as I'd have one ear open to hear traffic. So listening to music was for sitting at home or at the office but not for cycling through traffic.   if anything use a speaker but remember it makes you the DJ for all the people in your vicinity so it's up to you to make wise music choices."

I don't run any bike without fenders though, not only for rain but I feel it also protects a bit from other stuff and things like snails ect. It also keeps the drivetrain a bit cleaner. A rack is important for me for pannier with laptop or just some things like a jacket and sneaker under the straps. This makes me able to use the bike every day, as I'm a n=1 guy.

I went with Schwalbe Delta Cruiser gum wall 700x28's for the best comfort and puncture protection vs weight and price (and looks!). I put on SKS Bluemels 35mm mat black fenders. I ported over the rack of my previous setup, just like the pump, bottle cage, lights and repair kit stuff. I did buy a saddle bag instead of the old frame triangle I used to use.  I use one or two ortlieb panniers on my rides and commutes. That's about it.  O, the bike is a Pinarello Mercurio T2 Hydro with 105 group and disc brakes.   Tomorrow is going to be fun.

bikecommuting,3ay5ht,morridin19,3,Wed Jun 24 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"This happens all over the city I live in. They have a beautiful network of bike paths, and then designated ""Bike friendly"" road lanes, but they are always disjointed. The path ends and then 1 block later another path, or bike lane. Very poor design, they should have continued the bike path or widened the road and had a protected (barriered) bike lane adjoining the road.  Regardless you did the right thing going on the road."
bikecommuting,3ay5ht,eccentricfather,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:16:41 2015 UTC,I like the idea of cycle paths where you are isolated from the road.  So often though they just end and you have to re-merge with the road which is a pretty dangerous point.

The first thing they see shouldn't be a bike, it should be... well... a professional. You. Even though you bike every day, you don't want your bike to define you - let your work ethic do that. Also, from a practical point of view, as soon as it rains your bike is going to track in a tonne of rain and silt and make a mess of your office.  Cycling kit: This seemed counter intuitive to me, but it is actually more professional to wear a cycling kit than anything else. Part of being serious is wearing the right clothes for the right task. You wear a suit at work, and you wear cycling gear when you cycle. In my bank, the more professional employees, (like the investment bankers) wear kits and change into suits. The less professional employees just wear street clothes and then change into suits.  Just my two cents."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,sql_big_result,2,Tue Jun 23 01:36:05 2015 UTC,Bike at desk depends on where you work  We have dedicate spaces for it - but I can always stash it by the ping pong table   But yea - agree. I hate seeing messy desks. Bikes don't help
bikecommuting,3apsgn,kickstand,3,Tue Jun 23 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"I would take the same approach as you. Park at your cubicle unless someone complains. If someone complains, push back as much as you feel comfortable doing (talk you your supervisor, and/or Human Resources).  And yes, I ride in cycling clothes, and I keep a fan at my desk. I sit in front of the fan for 20 minutes, then change into work clothes. You might want to keep a spare set of underwear and socks, in case you ever forget them."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,the_real_xuth,6,Mon Jun 22 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"Hell, just keep at least one full change of clothes in/at your desk at all times."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,pot_icecream_ukulele,2,Mon Jun 22 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"I do exactly this on the days that I ride, I also try to get to work 20-30 minutes before everyone else so I can sit at my desk, stop sweating and change before anyone else comes in. I know its unnecessary to come in that early but it avoids anyone having any reason to think I get special treatment. I talked to the head maintenance guy and he lets me keep the bike in a closet in the basement, almost no one knows I ride."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,DrSwe,3,Mon Jun 22 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"I park my bike in the stairwell and change in the closest bathroom. If your work has a strict dress code and has all the bullshit office drama mine does, someone will eventually complain. I'd communicate with a supervisor about your intentions beforehand."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,tracygee,3,Mon Jun 22 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"It's your cube, so I don't think most employers would say anything about it, assuming your bike doesn't track in dirt or smells from old tape or something.  Wearing your kit into the actual office?  I'm not sure on that one.  If you show up early (well before official start time) and then change that would be okay.  I myself walk in the building and change immediately at the first restroom nearest the entrance door.    I don't know that I'd walk in sweaty and in my kit in front of office coworkers."
bikecommuting,3apsgn,yabuymeasoda,3,Mon Jun 22 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"If it is possible financially, I would still recommend having a dedicated commuter/pub bike which is not carbon/super expensive.

bikecommuting,3apsgn,unfunfionn,2,Tue Jun 23 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"In terms of clothing, depending on how long your commute is, I'd suggest always cycling in separate clothes. You're going to sweat and possibly get a bit dirty, and there's nothing more uncomfortable than spending the full day in those clothes.  So if you're going to change anyway, wear whatever you find most comfortable.  Best advice I ever received: leave as much stuff in the office as possible. On Monday morning, bring a bag with shoes, some changes of clothes, deodorant, dry wipes etc. Travel without a bag for the rest of the week, and take everything (except maybe the shoes, deodorant and dry wipes) home again on Friday evening. Leave an emergency shirt in the office at all times just in case."

Almost exclusively around here they're used for transportation, but also they're apparently not used much by low income residents, based on the clothing etc., I see on riders.  Also, commuting is a subset of transportation, not an alternative."

Low income people have the ability to benefit greatly from the local bike share but I see few people using it (just by educated guess like above poster).  We even have some bike stations in ""low income"" neighborhoods but everyone I know who uses those stations are people fixing up houses in that area because it's up and coming."
bikecommuting,3apmde,fantastipants,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Though ours (Boston, Hubway) is $85 a year.  Over the year that might be cheap, but on the spot a lot of them won't be able to raise it.  There are also notable station gaps in many low income areas, plus for conventional commute times there's often an imbalance of bikes.  You really can't park at 8:30am near where I work, nor can you find a bike at 5:30pm."

Edit:  Haven't really run into issues of bikes not available &/or all slots full except for things like festivals.  The rebalancers are out often and total riders is still on the low side of what they were expecting."

bikecommuting,3aoi5q,calantorntain,4,Mon Jun 22 06:01:49 2015 UTC,"I've had one for about six months and would give it 5/5 stars. I paid $40 for it on Amazon but saw it for $25 a few months later. My commute takes me on urban roads (~7.5 miles one way) over a mix of shared roads, bike lanes, and dedicated bike paths. I can definitely say the horn has prevented some situations from getting ugly/tragic but I still think the best tool is to ride defensively and predictably.   What I like about it - It's loud enough for drivers to hear through closed windows - Produces reactions from drivers that are similar to ones you'd get if you'd honked using a car horn - It doesn't need batteries - Not much of a hassle to remove when locking up the bike  What I don't like about it - The horn can be so loud that some drivers think the honking is coming from a car so they pull over to the side of the road (and into my line of travel)  - It's too loud to use on pedestrians - I wasn't able to place it closer to where my hands are in riding position. I have it mounted near my stem so if I need to honk I have to let go of my grips. I've gotten used to it though.  - The volume seems to drop off after the first few blasts. That's to be expected though since it's pressure driven and probably follows an inverse square function. It's still loud but keep in mind that the volume at full pressure isn't the same as when it's time to recharge."

bikecommuting,3aoi5q,fragglerock,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:07:38 2015 UTC,I've also avoided a few bad situations with mine. My best outcome is stopping someone from a hasty lane change or left-hook.

I have a cute little bell that I use for alerting pedestrians and other cyclists to my presence, but when a motorist obliviously pulls out in front of me, it is fantastic to have a way to reliably get their attention.

bikecommuting,3aoi5q,mikeybeef,2,Thu Jun 25 11:59:06 2015 UTC,I've never owned one but played around with them at the shop I worked at. They are loud and the fact that you can recharge them with a bike pump is awesome. If you don't need a water bottle it's a good option to get cars attention.

I've used it a number of times for that and I'm grateful I had it. It is water bottle shaped but I zip tied mine under my bars and just behind my bar bag. Definitely not to be used with pedestrians though. Only a serious a-hole would use it for that. Makes a great pairing with a bell though.
bikecommuting,3aoi5q,fdtc_skolar,2,Mon Jun 22 07:43:28 2015 UTC,I've thought about getting one but worry I would be too horn happy when I pass the golf course every afternoon. It becomes a game to catch a golfer mid swing.

bikecommuting,3aoi5q,eccentricfather,2,Mon Jun 22 12:40:11 2015 UTC,"I have had one for awhile. I use it mainly like you describe ""hey! Don't do that!"" Especially when somebody starts to encroach on me. They almost always move away from me when I give them a little toot.  One thing to be wary of, and this is with any of these loud noise makers, the temptation to use it just because you're pissed off and want them to know it is pretty high. This is escalation and can lead to intense situations that you don't really need. It's taken quite a bit of self reflection for me to get that impulse (mostly) under control.  Another thing is, don't use it on shared use paths. It gives pedestrians/joggers a heart attack. You should continue to use either a bell or your voice in that situation. Unless you've tried that already but they have the damn headphones up so loud they can't hear you."

I've known about these horns for years, but never pulled the trigger. I got one for her last year, zip tied the canister behind the seat tube above the fender, fits snugly on her bike. I'm impressed with it. She uses it infrequently, but says it's very effective. I like that it's very light weight and easy to refill (holds charge for a long time) with a floor pump. I'd get one for myself, but I have a very loud yell that I'm not timid about using. We both have jingley bells for peds."

I get the occasional 18-20 mph commute but I've never averaged that fast for a whole month.  (Those are bike computer speeds, meaning time spent fully stopped doesn't count.

Then everyone else would turn up their volume. Then everyone in the train would kill each other. So I didn't.  That's why you don't want to be that guy - because there's plenty of music you don't want to hear and to other people your music is what they don't want to hear.

bikecommuting,3ai8ek,cultmember,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it has pretty much been standard thinking to encourage filtering through residential neighborhoods during peak traffic hours to minimize congestion on major roads, leading to ""rat running"", especially in older neighborhoods (often urban) with grid layouts. Modern suburbs are often designed without direct through paths as a consequence (cul de sac). This is crappy in so many ways, especially for cyclists."

Almost every neighborhood had one or maybe two connections to the outside, so every time I walked or rode anywhere I was forced to go along busy, high-speed streets.  My favorite part of Portland road design: diverters. They keep the grid for cyclists and pedestrians, but prevent rat running vehicles (which are obviously annoying for people living in these neighborhoods, too, on what should be quiet streets). Beautiful."

For a 'one-and-only' bicycle that is used for a must daily commute, sensible items like fenders, rack(panniers?) and kickstand are more important than 'it looks pretty'.      Tubeless tires: Almost impossible to fix a flat 'on the road', and if you have heard of ""Murphy's Law"", choosing old fashioned tubes for a daily workhorse is a wise decision."

bikecommuting,3ahs5i,creatron,3,Sat Jun 20 12:31:33 2015 UTC,"Carrying spare tubes is the usual way, it seems, but if I have to bring them anyway (cancelling any weight benefit, and finding a place to store them on my bike), I might as well store them on the rim and use them."
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,mrCloggy,2,Sat Jun 20 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"Weight in your saddle bag is entirely different than weight on your rim. If it was merely about saving weight, then losing the tube would be an obvious choice. (besides, I think most commuters keep a spare tube handy anyways, so you're still down by one or two tubes if running tubeless)  That said, going tubeless isn't really about shaving weight, it's about reducing rolling resistance, having a greater range of usable PSI (mostly lower), and flat resistance.  I'm not really sure why the LBS guys were talking it up, though. Besides for MTB/CX guys I don't see much of a benefit for commuters. Besides the fact that neither of those bikes come with tubeless ready wheels or tires, so they're clearly trying to squirm another ~$500-$1,000 out of OP."
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,CarrotIronfounderson,5,Sun Jun 21 05:31:46 2015 UTC,"First, if the drop bar bike doesn't fit fenders and a rack, pass on it.  You want fenders and a rack.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.  Even if you pass on the rack to start, DO NOT PASS ON FENDERS.  You'll have a rack within 6 months anyway ;-)  Now, as for the bike style, for 16 miles, I'd probably go drop bars.  I have a much shorter commute on a flat bar bike and there are many days when I wish I could change hand positions or duck out of the wind a bit.  You should be able to find a bike with drops that is just as comfy as the straights.  Not all drop bar bikes have the geometry of racing bikes.  I've never heard anyone go tubeless for commuting.  My understanding is you can't easily fix it when you get a flat, so it's best to stay away for a get-around machine.  If your bike shop is pitching tubeless, make sure you stress that you're commuting, not racing, and if they still think tubeless is the answer consider another shop."

Look around for a roadbike/cx bike that can support a rack and fenders. I started out on an Escape 2 for the same exact commute as yours. After four months I was kicking myself and picked up a road bike. Much much better.

bikecommuting,3ahs5i,huck_cussler,4,Sat Jun 20 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"There's really no such thing as a ""commuter"". The Giant is a ""hybrid"". That said, hybrids kinda suck at everything. /u/Apollinaire131 summed it up quite well here."
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,SmartToaster,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:22:50 2015 UTC,I own a Giant TCX and still prefer my hybrid for my 5 mile commute. It's much more comfortable and it's still plenty fast.
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,Addicted2Qtips,4,Sat Jun 20 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I also own a Giant TCX, and also usually prefer my Hybrid. Granted, my hybrid is a nice, steel, rigid MTB with fat slicks on it, but that's essentially what Hybrids are anyways, just with thinner tires.  The problem with asking about hybrids on bike specific places is that most people posting are obsessive about their bikes, and most tend to trend towards different extremes of bikes instead of ""the middle"". So, road bikes, CX bikes, MTB, etc... whereas a hybrid can be a mix of some or all of those. (In fact, plenty of hybrids are pretty much exactly CX bikes with very slightly altered geometry and flat bars...)  As a guy who works in the industry and talks to people every day who aren't, and never will be, the guys obsessing and posting on internet forums, I can tell you Hybrids are a great choice for many people.  For sub 5 mile commutes nobody needs drop bars, but they might want them. (I know I do some days). The difference between a typical hybrid and CX, if bars aren't an issue, are so negligible to the general public that the Hybrid costing 1/4 the CX bike is a no brainer. And it probably handles better for that person, too. Obviously to someone like me, I obsess about those countless minutae that change the ride for me, even though if I didn't know about them, they probably would pose no discernible difference. And I don't want to ride a typical hybrid. But I'm honest with myself that it's pretty much 100% an appearance issue."
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,CarrotIronfounderson,2,Sun Jun 21 03:10:49 2015 UTC,There is about a $100 difference in MSRP.
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,dairypope,2,Sun Jun 21 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"It's really going to come down to personal preference between those two, and I can almost guarantee that you'll end up picking wrong.   I have yet to meet someone who got into bike commuting who bought the right bike on the first try.   We all think we know exactly what we want when we go in, then learn over the next few months what we really want.   For me, I bought a hybrid bike with front suspension because I was sure I was going to be doing some trail riding.   That was four years ago and I have yet to do any trail riding -- I gave that bike to a friend and now have only road/touring bikes with drop bars.  If you're into drop bars, and it sounds like you are, I might point you at the Giant Defy.   I ended up going to the two ends of the spectrum: I have a Madone 5.2 that's completely useless as a practical commuter (but a hell of a lot of fun) and a Surly Long Haul Trucker that's a great utility bike but definitely overkill when it comes to commuting.   The Defy had mount points for a rack and fenders, but was a light road bike, and I still think that I probably should have bought that.  So, four years in, I still don't have the right bike for regular commuting.   My personal preference would be the sportiest road bike I could find that has mount points and room for fenders and a rack.   In my minimal searching the Defy was the best one I found, but that was a couple of years ago.   If you find one even better, please let me know...I'm always in the market for n+1."

Unless it's old stock you're pretty much shit out of luck: Trek doesn't allow it's dealers to sell current year bikes for below the MSRP. Haggling isn't really a thing for bikes at bike shops.    You should be able to get them to discount accessories and have them installed at the time of purchase.  My LBS does 10-50% discounts and free installs on same-day purchases.  Well.... bottle cages are 50% off, most stuff is just 10%.  And fenders are a bit of a pain to install so they charge 50% the normal fee.  (Seriously, they charge less to assemble a bike, overhaul the bottom bracket, or overhaul the headset than they do to install fenders)"

This setup works okay on my 35c tires - I have had many punctures (we have tons of thorny goatheads here) and resulting Stan jizz in my face, but no flats in around 3000 miles of riding so far this year.  In spite of this, the relatively skinny tires are a real pain in the ass to get seated on the rims.  When I want to refresh the Stans, it can take me an hour to get the beads fully seated.  Unless you live in the desert with lots of goatheads, it's probably not worth going tubeless right away for commuting.  It has its benefits, but there can be a great deal of hassle involved with the setup.  I also prefer a bike with drops because sometimes that wind is a real bitch and it's nice to be able to cut into it a little better."

bikecommuting,3ahs5i,palthainon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"The Trek 1.1 looks great. The city escape will come with rack and fenders but you can add that yourself. Accessories that come on bikes below $1,000 tend to suck. With 8 miles you'll want as much speed as you can get and the comfort level will be significantly higher on the road bike after you've made the necessary adjustments (I have my crossrip angled to have me sitting further up when I grip the hoods, but not nearly as straight as a hybrid). Besides you can take the road bike on longer tours, strip the accessories and race if you want, etc. Hybrids are just slower due to the position your legs are in, hence why not one person races with them. Not that you have to race but it says something about the power offered to that position."
bikecommuting,3ahs5i,exFAL,4,Sun Jun 21 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"Hybrids are just slower due to the position your legs are in, hence why not one person races with them. Not that you have to race but it says something about the power offered to that position.   This is a really pervasive, and really wrong (often) statement. I'm almost positive you've never looked up the geometries from a standard hybrid, to something like a standard CX bike which is one of the most referred bike types for commuting in internet forums.  For fun, I just looked up two bikes I am very familiar with, since I work at a Giant dealer(and own one). The $350 Giant Escape typical sporty hybrid. And the $1600 Giant TCX which is the least expensive of their racy cyclocross bikes and go all the way up to $7500 models with the exact same geometry. This geometry has led to at least one Single Speed CX world cup wins (adam craig won it three times, I think, but I'm not sure if it was on the same geometry TCX more than once), and tons of pro CX victories.  Aside from one of them labeling stuff in inches, and the other in metric, you'll find only very small differences. Identical Seat tube angles (aka ""your position over the pedals), and the slow hybrid has a longer top tube (because it uses flat bars to even out that reach, compared to more reach on drop bars). Slightly longer chainstay on the hybrid (way better for panniers) which results in slightly longer wheelbase, so more ""stable"" less ""snappy"", but once again small issues. And if you compare a road bike to the often recommended CX bike, you also are gaining ""slow"" wheelbase on the CX bike...  To sum it up: sporty hybrids are pretty much just flat bar CX bikes. The difference is marketing, drop bars and level of componentry. I'll probably be downvoted for saying it, because us bike geeks love our labels and prestige. Just remember, I'm also the guy who rides one of these CX bikes all the damn time, and loves it.  Also, there are obviously some other details, compromises in tubing shape/thickness/diameter to make it more compliant instead of stiff, etc... was more addressing the specific quote, which is very commonly said. But considering people often recommend not quite racy CX bikes by Surly or Kona, you're already pretty much at Giant Hybrid territory, just with drop bars."

bikecommuting,3aeft8,laflavor,2,Fri Jun 19 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like my state of mind is better after I'm riding. I work an office job, so a lot of sitting around. It's nice to get out and get moving.   My biggest problem is trying to pace myself when it's 90+ and humid, some days I pace well and show up to work with a healthy glisten, some days I get wrapped up in the ride and show up to work a bit sweaty. We don't have showers and there aren't any nearby. Though my commute is fairly short, sometimes I wish it was longer."

If it's cold out, some kind of smart wool with a light rain jacket works for me.  I usually wear the hood under my helmet to keep my hair dry and it works wonders.  When it's warm out I just wear a quick drying top and bring a change of clothes rather than sweat it out in a rain coat.  I've had mixed success with boot toppers but man, wet squelchy shoes and socks is the worst.  I've found rain pants worthwhile if you're riding in hard rain.  Alternately, some kind of quick-dry pants and something to change into at work is a good option. Also - some kind of clear eye protection or eye glasses.  Having to hold one hand up and constantly blink isn't terribly safe. :p    Behavior-wise, just watch your speed and give yourself twice as much time to stop.  Keep testing your brakes (I mean, especially if you've got rim brakes).  Also watch out for paint on the road and metal grates that become super slick when it's wet.    I hail from Vancouver BC and rode through the winter and we get an average of 7.43"" (188.9mm) of rain in November (vs Seattle's average of 6.57"" (166.9mm) or Portland Oregon's 5.63"" (143mm) )  I did bail and catch the bus during one particularly brutal downpour where I was a bit ill prepared (my shoes were like brimming water buckets with some pruned sponge-swaddled feet inside) but luckily most of our rainfall is of the light-but-constant variety rather than monsoon style."

You just have to commit to riding and decide that riding is how you are going to get to work.  I've come to actually enjoy the really rainy days.  Nobody else is out and with the right gear it really isn't bad.   I keep a smaller bag with all my rain stuff in my dry bag and grab it when I think there is going to be rain.  That way I don't have to search for everything as I have it all in one place.  Any by everything I mean rain pants, shoe covers, helmet cover, extra gloves.  The worst is when you get soaked in the morning and have to put on wet shoes and socks at the end of the day, so I recommend having gear to avoid that from happening."

The worst part is putting damp clothes back on for the ride home, but it will either be raining still or it will have cleared up - so I'll get wet again or dry out on the way. I'd rather just accept being wet, I guess, than deal with all the gear it would take to stay dry.

bikecommuting,3affn5,DrHotmann,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:59:23 2015 UTC,A wide down tube helps with rain spray but doesn't block it nearly as well as fenders. Turn you wheel? Spray misses the down tube. Going straight? Spray still goes on your feet and legs at the bottom of a pedal stroke more so than it would with fenders. Fenders also help to keep water filled with grime off of your drivetrain so it doesn't need cleaning as frequently and doesn't wear out as fast.

In part, that's why I left the wire stitching exposed on my last 2 repairs - to give the crack some spring action to see if that doesn't prevent further cracks."
bikecommuting,3adi1e,sixyeartrim,3,Fri Jun 19 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"Have you tried isolating the problem? So, if not, try this:  Ride with just regular shoes for 10 miles. If no numbness, it's not your riding position / posture.   Ride with your shoes again but don't lace them so tight. If toes go numb, it could be cleat positioning. If not, shoes are too tight.   You can screw with the cleat positioning yourself and I think there are some guides online to dial that in. It could be that the cleat is digging into a nerve that runs through the bottom of your foot but I'm not a doctor or podiatrist so take that with a grain of salt."

Suggestions that I've found from the internet:  -Adjust cleat position.  -Check bike fit.  -Slightly bigger shoes required.  -Tie shoes less tightly.  -Get a shoe with a stiffer sole.  -Could be a mild sign of sciatica, stretch more.  None of these worked for my wife (though she never did get a professional bike fit), however yesterday she had a breakthrough: she used one gear lower than usual, so had a slightly higher cadence and less foot mashing on the pedals. Time will tell if that's a sustainable solution."

bikecommuting,3acpez,luthan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that the bike is taking the extra weight, not your legs. This means you can go further for less effort.

With both bags (I normally only use one) I carry all my work gear and get a weeks worth of groceries on my way home (well, minus the vegetables that get delivered to my house anyway).  Lastly, it just feels much nicer, more free I guess, to not have anything on your back while riding.  Edit: And yes, I take the bag off the bike with me.

I still tried commuting over the winter (US) and slipped a handful more times before I gave up until the spring (thankfully I learned how to take a fall, try to get your feet/legs under you when you're falling. Best case, you land on your feet, worst case you bruise up a knee but save your head from cracking against something). It took me about 2 months now of commuting daily to really get my groove back, and even now I'm super cautious and every once in a while have to stop due to anxiety.  My only advice is to keep going, and take it super slow. Give yourself extra time and if you're feeling anxious while riding, pull over. The only way you'll get your confidence back is by riding."

There's a shared crossing with lights (pedestrian crossing + bike symbol so legal to ride across) I use everyday. In a space of about a month 3 people blew the red and almost hit me at those lights, I had some guy blast his horn (next to a funeral as well) as I was riding the lane and there were cars parked everywhere, so he had to just wait and some jack ass blast his horn, swerved around me almost hitting a bus.   Its now been two months of peace."
bikecommuting,3a82ap,KillerSeagull,2,Thu Jun 18 06:49:36 2015 UTC,It is a real phenomenon that things happen in bunches.  Imagine three random events happen a year. The odds of them being spread out evenly are much lower than the odds of two of them being close together and one far apart. Ergo we perceive it as happening in a bunch.

bikecommuting,3a82ap,shazammerbammer,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience at two stop signs in a row today.  At the first one, I was stopped, and proceeded through the intersection, looking toward the driver pulling up to my left.  He ignored the stop sign as I was already a quarter of the way through.  I turned my head around, and saw him flipping me off out the window.  Then, moments later at a second one, I stopped, and there was someone to my right that arrived after, and someone coming from opposite my direction.  I went at the same time as the person coming from the opposite direction.  As I was about halfway through, the driver to my right decided it was time to go.  I rang my bell to get his attention, and he laid on the horn.  (Yeah, I know you're there.  That's why I'm ringing).    Thinking through it, I wondered if I was doing something wrong.  But I was at the stop sign first in both instances.  The bell certainly helped to get people's attention, and I was also trying to make eye contact, albeit unsuccessfully.  Overall, I think there are just some people you have to expect are going to be aggressive drivers.  You can't fix them.  You just have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst in every last interaction."

bikecommuting,3a82ap,jrjohnstone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:22:48 2015 UTC,"I know the that exact stretch you're talking about. It's one of those poor bike infrastructure planning because you go from a dedicated bike lane over I-25 to a Sharrow. I find those types of transitions are where you see the most of those impatient behaviors from drivers as like what you pointed out. Another very similar problem is on MLK westbound when it goes from a bike Lane to a Sharrow between York and Downing.   Personally, I think this is an infrastructure problem that can't be solved with better driver education. I don't think it's reasonable to expect bad drivers to go from driving 35-40mph with bikes in a dedicated Lane to having then share the road with bikes.  I don't know if it would be more of a nuisance for you to go on Milwaukee or St. Paul and then connect back to Steele after Mississippi just to avoid that particular stretch."

The mayor doesn't really give a crap about bicycle infrastructure, so it's been moving along at a snails pace and he just won re-election uncontested. The city has been doing what they can, the lanes on 26th and 23rd through park hill are nice, unfortunately, they just kinda end with no signage or direction. I used to ride along welton out of town paralleling the light rail, but it's terrifying, so I changed my route and actually ride briefly up a 1 way street to get to glenarm, after one sketchy intersection, I'm home free. I was told this section will be getting re-striped and hopefully easier to navigate.  I have noticed a bit more hostility the last month or two. Just more aggressive passing, less patience, etc. I ride pretty fast, mostly follow the law, and I'm rarely ""scared"". Recently my parents visited and we rode to the rockies game, my mom was white knuckling the entire time. I've been told the ultimate test for bike infrastructure is ""would your mom feel comfortable riding it"". Based on that, we have a long way to go."

The camera is a nice solution because when someone does something stupid near me, I just watch the video later, laugh, and post it on youtube. Then other people can lend me advice or their humorous takes on what happened. I've heard that sometimes just having the camera can deter incidents.  (1) is a more serious issue because it is the most common type of bike accident, and I think you might be able to do more to prevent it. When this happened to me, the next day I ordered some reflective tape for my frame. Specifically, this stuff. I've had it on there about 6 months now and it's holding fast. However, there are many other things out there such as reflective paints, tire lights, and reflective tape in different colors. Something like that should help you be seen better from the broad side in a way that your front and rear lights do not. Good luck."

I think it has correlated to pot being legal meaning more immigrants from other states coming here. For every bad driver, I like to think there are at least 5 good ones. Only takes one though to end a life.  My latest example: I was biking home from Autozone in a neighborhood. Got to a four way stop and proceeded to stop as SUV approached. I went through the stop sign, SUV blows through it and comes within 3 feet of me. I slam on the brakes, look around to try and understand what just happened. SUV behind the one that blew the stop sign rolled his window down and said ""Can you believe what just happened"". I was happy not to be hit, but almost thought about catching up, getting a plate and calling the cops for aggressive driving."

A woman I worked with was cycling to work a few days ago when she was killed as she crossed a road and was struck by a car. She was 23 years old. I didn't know her, but I feel at least some connection to anyone who enjoys biking and makes it part of their daily lifestyle, so this has just been another very sad reminder of how vulnerable we can be when exposed to traffic, and it's hot particularly close to home this time. I don't know the details of what happened, but regardless, she is dead.

Then again, I say that and distinctly remember that last night, some dude in an F-150 intentionally drifted into the unprotected portions of the 15th Street bike lane, nearly pushing me into the gutter, despite my following every rule, so I dunno exactly.

The thing is I don't want to Change Your View, I support it, as do most other /r/bikecommuting members I would expect.  I didn't have time to read every comment but I'll make another to add to your post:    Idaho Stop Laws are also advantageous because, while public education is great, the way the laws are written means that in effect, the only people that REALLY need to know the law, are the cyclists.  If you treat a stop sign as a yield sign, the only time you'd come to a complete stop is - if you have to yield - or maybe you are unfamiliar with the intersection and would like to stop before you proceed.  In both cases, the driver of the motor vehicle just has to follow the rules of the road and there shouldn't be a conflict. The only time this gets a little grey is at 3 or 4 way stops, where I have heard that cyclists must stop when a car is already at the intersection. I don't have a citation - perhaps you can clarify. Red lights are the same:  Motorists won't be impacted at all if they are following the rules of the road.    The only potential conflict are cyclists passing cars to reach - and pass through a signaled intersection.  I'm in Colorado, so I'd be interested in hearing how this works in Idaho. The only time I'll do that here is when I have a bike lane or at an intersection with one way traffic where I won't be in a potential turn lane.  I've been bike commuting for 17 years, and I'd feel nervous on many roads passing a line of cars waiting at a red light.  I think you WOULD need some signage to calm motorists rage.   I would also add in your CMV that anyone that brings up, ""But bicycles already break the rules"" should be reminded that the majority of motorists also break the rules - regularly.   That's a different debate and not applicable to this discussion.  (And even if it was, we could discuss speeding, aggressive driving, failure to signal and I would venture to guess that everyone would agree - that pretty much everyone breaks road rules).  Idaho Stop Laws are a way to adapt motor vehicle laws, to Road rules which include all road users."
bikecommuting,3a7kw3,JingJang,4,Wed Jun 17 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Sounds like we definitely agree on this issue for the most part. To clarify one issue you raised, the law doesn't go into the issue of ""filtering"" or when a bicycle skirts the edge of the lane pass waiting cars to get to the red light. That's still illegal in Idaho unless the cyclist is in a bike lane. The law basically applies to cyclists who are already at the light or stop sign.  Ride on!"

There are a lot lights here that don't get triggered by a bike and I take a lot of cross streets with no vehicular traffic because there are 4 way stops every block and speed bumps. TBH, I 99% of the time do just come to a complete stop, but most commuters I've spoken with are pretty into the Idaho stop laws possibly coming to Chicago. So, seriously, what about them do you dislike?"
bikecommuting,3a7kw3,chrisonabike22,4,Thu Jun 18 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the sensor stops are the one thing going for the Idaho stop.  We all know that in this sub, we're all great law abiding cyclists. The fact that I'm in this sub should tell you that I'm pro-bike. That said, I am pretty much the only cyclist on my commute who actually follows the rules of the road. You can't explain this away like usual with ""oh that's confirmation bias,"" because I'm not biased against bike commuters in the first place. In this sub, we're a particular group of cyclists who pride ourselves on, amongst other things, safety. We're not the 90% of casuals who don't know the rules or ignore them.  What's that got to do with the Idaho stop? My issue is that "" when done properly it is completely safe."" But people forget that the current laws should be that safe when followed properly. The fact is that they aren't. Introducing further ambiguity onto the road will only serve to confuse.  Plus, not all motorists are completely abreast of cycling related news, and furthermore, motorists only need to pass their driving test once. They never relearn road rules, so may well not understand what cyclists are doing if there's a new rule. The key relationship between cyclists and motorists should be predictability. If you can't predict the actions of a cyclist because you don't know what laws he/she is following, then danger follows."
bikecommuting,3a7kw3,Grauzevn8,2,Thu Jun 18 07:41:36 2015 UTC,Agreed.   Even the police officers aren't fully aware of bicycle laws in Chicago about 3 feet passing and taking the lane. Yes adding more laws without better education and infrastructure does lead to inadequate responses from others and unwarranted confrontations.
bikecommuting,3a7kw3,user_1729,3,Thu Jun 18 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your view and how you disregard a lot of the points brought up in the CMV. I actually wrote a post, posted it, then deleted it when I read someone had made the same argument and you just disregarded it. I generally agree with you, but I'd rather see efforts towards expansion of infrastructure. Idaho stop would not change a single thing about my daily commute, but just a few enhancements in infrastructure would really help. Efforts should be put towards that instead of pushing for a largely useless expansion of the Idaho stop. I've heard of very few tickets related to stop sign/light running by bicycles and generally most 4 ways are treated like idaho anyway, in that, if I have right of way I go, if I don't I stop and no one seems to mind.   edit: our traffic is based on ""stops"" not ""yields"". In europe, they have a yield based system and the idea of this doesn't even make sense. I don't think it's prudent to have some vehicles be yield based and some stop, it creates confusion. All that said, if a state/city wants to adopt idaho stop, I'd be thrilled.  edit again: basically, people don't skip cycling because of confusion at stop signs, they don't ride because there is difficult access on their route, dangerous roads/intersections, essentially they don't ride because there's no infrastructure to facilitate their ride. Not riding has nothing to do with ""should I or should I not stop at a stop sign"" or ""oh dear this light never changes even though there are no cars around"""

For me, the ""goal"" of bike laws, infrastructure, and facilities is to increase modal share. If your goal is simply to hand out fewer tickets to bicycles for moving violations, I support that, but don't think it's productive.  How does this increase the modal share for bicycles? Are people deciding to hang up the bike because they have to stop at a stop sign? People don't ride because of the perception of danger, bad drivers, poor infrastructure, lack of facilities, weather, crappy roads, etc, in no list of ""what keeps people from riding"" is ""stopping at stop signs"" found.  The idaho stop does nothing to address any of the reasons people don't ride and likely won't do anything to increase ridership. So again, while I agree with you and appreciate your passion, I just don't see much point in considernig the law change."

In Boston, most cyclists either run lights/stops or do Idaho stops anyway. Changing the law to make the Idaho part legal at least removes some of the envy of the person driving.  But yeah, if your goal is to make cycling more popular and safer, the Idaho stop is a minor issue. Its really a minor issue anyway. One of the most dangerous things a cyclist can do in Boston* is blow through a light.   This is based on data from a boston cycling report."
bikecommuting,3a7kw3,Grauzevn8,2,Fri Jun 19 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"Right, this never makes blowing through a light okay. I've seen proposals to make cyclists not stopping at stop signs the ""lowest level of enforcement"" for LEOs, basically unless you cause a crash you won't get in trouble. That's ESSENTIALLY the idaho stop, without changing the law or requiring any kind of expensive campaign, and really it's what happens now. Cops rarely cite cyclists for anything but the most egregious violations, I'm not saying I don't support the idaho stop, I just think it's a waste of effort. I've talked to friends about this even more recently and none of them suggest that trouble with stop signs/lights are a deciding factor in their choice to ride or not, which coincides with pretty much every survey on what keeps people from riding.   I can't really comment on the road rage thing, some people care, some don't, and I doubt a change of law will make the ones who want to throw trash at cyclists change their view."

bikecommuting,3a3mwk,ePierre,3,Tue Jun 16 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the conditions you're going to be riding in are pretty extreme and this might be necessary.  To me, any mask is going to hinder your intake or make you perform completely different.   It will likely just impair how fast or how much you can ride before you get winded.  You might not notice that at first but if you take your time, it shouldn't be an issue.  I ride with a hefty mask in winter and its great for warmth and wind breaking but ripping that thing off mid hill or after the commute was incredible.  Mind you, I always feel like I have to haul ass for some reason even if I'm not late."
bikecommuting,3a3mwk,ichthyohead,2,Wed Jun 17 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer!  It's currently so hot that I'm already taking my time when riding, because if not I would arrive at work completely soaked in my own sweat :) And also because Taiwanese people drive really bad so I'm usually careful when riding.  I guess I'll have to give it a try then and see by myself."
bikecommuting,3a3mwk,azer89,2,Wed Jun 17 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"An engineer friend told me that masks don't really work against pollution unless you have a full face mask with an oxygen cannister. The pollution particles are so fine so they will go through the masks. Moreover, you'll have breathing problem if the mask you wear is too thick. I heard in Taipei 8am and 6pm are busy hours, can you avoid them?"
bikecommuting,3a3mwk,Mykrroft,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:02:44 2015 UTC,I rode my motorcycle with a Respro in the hot summers in TN. You will probably like it. It can be a little itchy but for 20 minutes you will be fine. Get the correct size if you can figure it out.
bikecommuting,3a3mwk,blooregard325i,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  I'm in Guangzhou (so it's bloody HOT) and I have one of the Respro Techno masks.  It originally came with a thin cotton filter that they claim is enough to combat most pollution at road level.  However, I didn't really believe it after still getting a slightly gritty mouth after a ride.  I started buying the 3M N95 filters in 100 packs (from taobao) and cutting out the hoels for the vents, and the mouth grit has gone away.  Now, during the winter I have no issues with my mask and one filter can usually last about two weeks before I need to change it.  On a new filter, I still get some back pressure and need to slow my breathing.  If I'm REALLY pushing, my ears will begin to become de-equalized, like holding your nose and blowing/sucking.  This is just the nature of the beast.  But the alternative is riding without the mask and getting constant lung infections, so I put up with it.  During the summer, it gets drenched in sweat and turns dark quickly, prompting a one-week change at the most.  I need every molecule of air that I can get, and a slightly dirty filter will destroy a ride.  Today I realized this going over a very long bridge, I should've changed the filter a few days ago.   So...  as others have said, yes, you will have some degraded air flow.  The N95 mask, according to 3M, filters out the PM2.5 that everyone here is so paranoid about.  I like them, I continue to buy them, and I don't have too much difficulty riding, commuting, or enjoying everything about my bike.    I hope it helps!"

It's not long enough to really keep your feet dry. The full SKS longboards go down about another 3 inches and its literally the difference between dry and soaked feet.  I had a ride in heavy rain. 35 minutes in my front fender mudguard broke off - almost exactly where your fender is. So after 8 miles or so, going through puddles in a full downpour, my feet (in sandals) are basically still dry. 100 feet later they are fully 100% soaked.  Just a thought. Depends on how much you're riding in the rain."

So today I rely on a car pool for car access, and I use once a month. I bring home fresh groceries by bike, I bike all seasons.  This is what made me take the step, the step to not have a car at all. I live where it is easy and not uncommon to have this lifestyle. I think that is probably what to go for, move where you can get bike culture."

bikecommuting,3a31ux,iconictroll182,3,Tue Jun 16 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"I live with my girlfriend in a suburb-y part of the greater houston area. Public transport is non existent. I can get a bus that takes me downtown, but I don't ever need to be there, so it's useless to me. I sold my car well over a year ago now, probably over 2 now that I think about it, and can't imagine going back. I ride my bike where I need to go and we use her car for everything we have to. It's a hatchback so it's more than capable of anything we've ever needed including bringing all of my bikes to various places for different things or picking me up if she's heading along my route that day.  It was scary at first, I remember walking away from actually selling the car and kind of being like ""what did I just do"", but I spent two months prior to listing it for sale where I made it a goal to not use it once, around here that's plenty of time to experience just about any sort of insane weather we may get, so I knew I'd be able to make it work.  It's been a rainy year around here and it still works just fine for me.  If I can't or don't want to go by bike it does take some prior thought to make a schedule work with being dropped off by her or vice versa but we haven't had an instance yet where either of us was stranded. On an average day I easily go more than 15 or 20 miles from home so I don't stay close either.  I think the thing that finally made me just do it was making small goals like the 2 months without the car or forcing myself to figure out what I needed to bring on the bike to always have clean clothes or dry clothes.   Sorry if this came off as sort of rambly, I'm on my phone and not much of a writer but I do hope it helps. I genuinely believe with enough forethought any family can be a one car family.  You might have to make small sacrifices (like I no longer just go drive around to whatever random location on days off, everywhere I go is usually purposeful or at least more intentional which is probably good as well) but overall when you have that extra money every month and you don't have to worry about the car witting out in that hail storm or that bad part of town and there's no stress to remember the car bill or insurance it just makes it all so worth it. I can say confidently I don't really see myself ever buying another car.  I will certainly look at places I move with greater scrutiny to make sure they're as easy to get around as possible but I enjoy the freedom of having no car, no oil changes, no environmental impact, no wiper blade replacements, and no ac problems much more than I ever enjoyed being able to get to walmart faster."

Knowing that I wasn't entirely without a car, it was just slightly less accessible at all times. When I was doing lots and lots of googling asking the same question you are right now the best advice I saw was try a dry run. Put your keys away and leave them put away for a certain amount of time and see if you can do it. It really helps to ease a lot of the stress when you realize what you feared really wasn't any issue at all, and you learn that things you never even thought about are the real issue. But, if you can go for a month you can go for a year and so on and so forth.

Here are a few - if they aren't available where you live you at least have an idea what features you might look for: Focus Planet TR Belt 2015  Spot Acme  Avanti Inc3  The only hesitation I have is that my Spot Acme is an early production of the Alfine 11 hub and I have had issues. But various bike shops and other owners with later productions have told me that while the early ones had problems with the higher tension of a belt, later ones do not.

When the XTR 9-speed shifter failed on my mountain bike I dismantled it and it was obvious that while it was built in a bulletproof way, the part that failed was built to fail.

bikecommuting,3a0asz,yanweng,4,Tue Jun 16 05:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think this is really a personal preference.  Carrying an extra pair of glasses isn't going to make your break your commuting pannier or backpack or whatever you use.  One downside to transitions lenses is that they take a minute or two to darken and lighten, so the first few minutes of your commute will be without sunglasses, and once you arrive indoors at work you'll be with sunglasses for a couple minutes.  Not a major deal, but something to consider.  Also transitions usually don't cover your eyes as well as regular sunglasses.  You could also get a visor for your helmet.  I think all of these options are valid; it just comes down to personal preference."

I only see a problem if you're employer is very vocal about prohibiting sunglasses indoors. Transition or photo chromatic lenses can change under a minute depending on the manufacture.

I have found that the worst weather actually happens when I get out of work, in the afternoon/early evening, not early in the morning and I don't mind getting wet and having to change as soon as I get home; it's a mindset really. On the other hand, I have a very nifty rain-suit (coat and trousers; like this one: http://www.coleman.com/product/35mm-mens-pvcpoly-rain-suit/COLE9676?contextCategory=31019#.VX1700a8lp0) which can be easily bought in many stores around here, which keep you relatively dry.  I do see many people waiting out the worst part of the storm under overpasses too, and as someone said before, leaving earlier or later is usually an option.  One of the things I really love is a weather radar app on my phone. We have a local one called ""Buienradar"" which translates to ""Shower/storm radar"" and it shows you when it'll start to rain; it shows our whole tiny little country or it can show just your locale and shows a nice graph of how much rain is expected in the next two hours; indespensable for bike-commuters.

I try to focus on much more likely causes of death, like SUVs.  Or heart disease.

Not only did the snow slush from my front wheel fill my cassette (so only one gear was working), only 50% the bike paths were cleaned - like seriously, 20 cm wet snow outside the cleaned areas (mostly around bus stops). I tried taking one ""official"" bike path and got stuck going uphill, because ice under snow was so slippery, even my 200 stud tires didn't hold. After putting my feet on the ground, only both of them were able to keep me upright, I had to retreat in small backwards steps (bike still between my legs) to come to a less steep part to dismount the bike.  After that I took a couple of days off commuting, allowing the cleaning crews some time to clean the paths and myself to regain the strength."

I've been in the situation where I want to turn right, so I stay behind the cyclist rather than pass, only to realize that I could have passed the cyclist easily and still have had time to get over and make the turn. Other drivers err on the other side, passing the cyclist before realizing they won't be able to get over to make the turn without cutting the cyclist off.   The other factor at play is one of seemingly available space. The driver sees space for his vehicle ahead. He's used to having that space blocked off from view by the car in front, but a bike doesn't block it. So it seems like there is more space than there is."

BUT I would also say that when driving I am more anxious with an additional type of vehicle...similar to a motorcycle but more so because on a the amount of variability in how cyclists ride is unpredictable. I think the way you ride makes a lot of sense, but there are people who weave in and out, some people are on the sidewalk for whatever reason then come onto the street, sometimes cyclists are going the speed limit, sometimes they are well below, some cyclists always signal their turns, others don't. My point is that being behind the wheel when cyclists are present means that there is a much greater degree of uncertainty in what will happen next so I think most cars want to get around and in front of cyclists so they don't have to deal with it. Not saying it's right but I understand where drivers get uncomfortable.   I also should add that I think this is slowly starting to change around the country so hopefully it will get better."

Go to a hardware store and get some electrical P-clamps, and a couple small bolts with matching nuts. The P-clamps go over the seat stays, and then you can mount the stay arms of any cheap universal rack to them with the bolts and nuts. Done this on two old bikes now, works a charm, holds more weight than you'd think it would. Lets you use any old cheap universal rack you can find."

I had a rack on P clamps that worked outstanding for months, then slid down into the cassette while I was riding and made for a bad day.   edit: they also sell racks that attach via a QR skewer.

bikecommuting,39l9ek,PRESTOALOE,3,Fri Jun 12 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"That exists, too.  For example, I wear a Keen Commuter cycling sandal year-round and have clipless pedals.

bikecommuting,39l9ek,feelingproductive,2,Fri Jun 12 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"Some people like them and some people don't. The advantage obviously is not having to change the pedal. The disadvantages are:    1. Have to flip pedal over with foot when trying to ride again, often at an intersection where you want your head to be up and looking at cars rather than down at your pedals.  2. Usually the reason people say is efficiency and you gain little or no extra power from clipless.  3. Puts your foot at a slightly different height one way or the other. Not a huge deal if your trips on the flat side are always short, but it's different."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,2,Fri Jun 12 18:58:38 2015 UTC,I agree on the power difference. I really like being clipped in for the security of knowing my feet won't slip off the pedals.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,grandzooby,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"That's true, it's the most secure attachment to the pedal that you can get, while still being able to get out quickly in an emergency."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:31:27 2015 UTC,I like these too. I usually ride in Shimano mountain bike shoes because they're comfortable enough to walk around in.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,grandzooby,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"I had those but didn't like them. I was always clipped in, so I was wasting half the pedal and always had to make sure that they were the correct orientation. I switched to the double sided spd pedals."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,tribrn,10,Sat Jun 13 05:34:09 2015 UTC,"Once you go clipless you won't understand how you ever did otherwise. Get yourself some mountain bike shoes that you can walk in, and you'll be solid. Also most pedals can be adjusted, so when you get the shimano's listed by /u/julio26pt2 and set them to really light exit effort, you'll basically fall out of the pedal before you fall to the ground. I had those for a while, and mostly used them. One day I finally switched and used the platform side, and I couldn't ever do it again. Now I only ride clipless, it's worth it."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,SeanBlader,8,Fri Jun 12 15:14:19 2015 UTC,"Its funny, I used toe clips for about a decade, got clipless pedals for about decade, now i have pedals that have clips on one side and flats on the other. I generally ride on the flats just because.  But in the end, I really don't care either way. I know I'm probably an anomaly. My speed doesn't matter one side or the other. Being clipped in would probably be better on rough terrain, but I'm on roads.  For knee pain, I'd say not to use clips. If they're not adjusted absolutely perfectly, you'll find your foot/leg alignment off, which could just make it worse - it's certainly not going to help remove knee pain."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,shazammerbammer,4,Fri Jun 12 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"This. I switched all of my bikes bake to rat-traps and platforms, I'm much more comfortable being able to slide my foot around and change the angles to relieve strain. And on my commuters I don't care enough about going fast for there to be any advantage anyway, so, they were all fuss and no benefit for me. I suppose if OP really wants to try dual platforms they can contact me now, though. I've got a small collection of those chilling in my parts drawers. Not a believer in the clipless hype."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,zedmartinez,3,Fri Jun 12 16:01:25 2015 UTC,I think for mountain biking it is better. It's nice to be able to bunny hop without having to do anything special.  And I had a period of time where I swore clipless was better. Then I had a summer that I rode a lot in flip-flops and realized it really didn't matter much.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,shazammerbammer,3,Fri Jun 12 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see their advantage for technical riding. And they're nice in the rain, but platforms with decent studs are getting more common and some of those are like I glued my foot down as soon as I push'em, so, not missing that part too much. All my bikes are just transportation though. Tried them on the original commuter, seemed OK, put'em on a light touring rebuild. Then the next year I was riding a 3 speed roadster around all summer with just cheap block platforms and it was just so much nicer not having to worry and fuss. So, don't think I'll be going back just for transportation anyway."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,zedmartinez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed - it's nice to be able to just go without worrying about shoes. If someone wanted to try clipless, i'd recommend the ones you can use with normal shoes.   Lately, I've been finding the flats really nice for relieving certain knee strain - been doing a lot of long hikes for training and my body is usually pretty sore."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,shazammerbammer,-1,Fri Jun 12 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"change the angles to relieve strain   In all honesty the strain is because you were not properly set up on your bike.   Not a believer in the clipless hype.   It's not hype, it's proven."

bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,3,Sat Jun 13 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"In all honesty the strain is because you were not properly set up on your bike.   My bikes are perfectly set up. No one obsesses over fit quite like I do. I'm sure somewhere there was a combination of shoe/cleat that would have given me enough float and angle to be comfortable and not get the occasional hot spots or strain on the side of my right knee. But for considerably less time and resources I can just wear my old Chucks and use a platform pedal, and see absolutely no differences in my times because I'm just a transportational commuter and honestly averaging 15mph for a commute is damn good day for me anyway. Absolutely nothing in my riding style that clipless actually improved. I'm sure it matters a lot at the competitive end of things, but I don't think it's really all its sold as for most people just looking to use a bike to go from A to B. Hence my use of the word hype. Like I said. I used them for a year on two bikes I thought I liked them enough. Got another bike the next year without them and realized they weren't for me. Maybe they're for you, hell if I know and I won't presume like you. Just saying, not everybody who gets on a bike ever will benefit from or prefer clipless. Others will. Strokes for folks."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,zedmartinez,7,Fri Jun 12 18:06:02 2015 UTC,Knee pain is probably due to bad fit of your bike. I'd get that fixed before you change pedals.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,grandzooby,5,Fri Jun 12 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"This should be the top comment. You really don't need clipless pedals for commuting! Really! And if you are experiencing knee pain, it's not the lack of clipless pedals that's to blame, it's something else.   Clipping in to a poorly fitting bike will probably only make things worse."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,arvi1000,3,Fri Jun 12 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"I've been experiencing some knee pain lately while commuting and have been tweaking all the details that cause it--saddle height, foot positions, etc. But I don't use clipless pedals at the moment, and it was suggested to me that I should.   There's something completely different that helped with knee pain for me, fyi. I was the opposite - clipless caused knee pain, flats did not.  I started doing workouts with a barbell, and once I got decent form down, my knee pain after riding suddenly almost completely went away. I'm over 200lbs, and I think I was lifting around 150lb's at the time (light for squats), and a few rounds of that straightened out and strengthened whatever caused the pain in my knees and it went away.  Fyi."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,2,Fri Jun 12 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm in a similar boat.  Now I get foot pain when the saddle is too low rather than knee pain."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,takeshita_kenji,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, haven't found a total cure for foot pain after riding..."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"Great suggestion, I'll try that!  Thanks!"
bikecommuting,39l9ek,Doofendoofer,2,Fri Jun 12 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"It is possible, but it's definitely not comfortable. Some pedal companies make 2 sided pedals that are clipless on one side and flat on the other. You might want to check those out!"
bikecommuting,39l9ek,and_one_more_thing,2,Fri Jun 12 14:58:40 2015 UTC,Clipping in is not a big deal—I clip in and out at every stop light. The issue is wearing the right shoes. I'd suggest looking for a more casual shoe with recessed clips so you can walk around like a normal person when off the bike. Chrome and DZR both offer some decent shoes like this.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,bssheckler,2,Fri Jun 12 17:37:50 2015 UTC,I have the DZR Mechanics and I love them for commuting and city-riding. Wear my Shimano's when I'm doing touring rides on trails.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,2,Fri Jun 12 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though I've had trouble finding flat shoes specifically made for biking that are wide. From what I've read, Chrome shoes are good, but...definitely not wide..."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,SmartToaster,2,Fri Jun 12 19:15:31 2015 UTC,I use M520s and my commute is only 1.7 miles. It used to be a lot longer but it really is no big deal. Just throw on my shoes and go.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,JamesB5446,2,Fri Jun 12 17:47:01 2015 UTC,Clipless won't solve your knee pain.  You really don't need clipless for a short commute.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,paddymcredditor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:03:17 2015 UTC,"I work as a messenger and a waiter. I don't ride clipless so I can wear sneakers all day. They're great on the bike, but not a necessity. Probably won't help too much with your legs."
bikecommuting,39l9ek,mast3rbates,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:16:20 2015 UTC,https://www.performancebike.com/bikes/Product_10052_10551_1167245_-1_400265__400265  they default to straight up and down almost so you push forward on them to clip or slide your foot across them backwards with regular shoes.

bikecommuting,39l9ek,trainwrecktourist,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:24:22 2015 UTC,anyone know if the performance bike FORTE brand dual pedal is any good?
bikecommuting,39l9ek,s3rious_simon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:45:21 2015 UTC,Strongly depends on the specific pedals used.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,takeshita_kenji,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:12:15 2015 UTC,I recall chatting with someone whose friend was killed on the road because his flip-flops slipped off clipless pedals and he lost control.  You'd be better off getting a set of pedals with either a platform on one side or a full-grip cage around the SPD clip.
bikecommuting,39l9ek,RedPill115,6,Fri Jun 12 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, you could also not wear flip flops while biking. That sucks and everything, but that is a particularly terrible combination. :-/"
bikecommuting,39ihfp,bekonstructive,5,Thu Jun 11 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I tend to finish work around 2am and people are always incredulous that I cycle at that time.  Awesome views, no traffic, battering full speed down the middle of roads that are gridlocked most of the day - night commutting is the most fun..."
bikecommuting,39ihfp,I_am_Moby_Dick_AMA,3,Fri Jun 12 10:56:00 2015 UTC,"I love cycling at night for those reasons.  On my commuter bike, my main lighting is dynamo powered, and I get a kick out of the thought that I'm lighting my own way!"
bikecommuting,39ihfp,HipsterDashie,2,Fri Jun 12 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"I was cycling for a bit at 5 am in a small town.  Got to watch a fox carry its prey back the den all cocky like.  Also, I tend not to spook the deer as much and get to watch them more naturally."
bikecommuting,39ihfp,CannaJava,2,Fri Jun 12 18:54:09 2015 UTC,?????
bikecommuting,39ihfp,sfdmfcssfd,2,Fri Jun 12 13:50:27 2015 UTC,Absolutely is!  Nice hill climbs to get there too :)
bikecommuting,39ihfp,frantic_seabug,2,Fri Jun 12 14:18:01 2015 UTC,That's a majestic monument to a beautiful bike if I've ever seen one.
bikecommuting,39j9fg,americancanuck,7,Fri Jun 12 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you got out relatively alright. Take time to rest and heal up.  The tight rear brake might be due to the crash causing the rear wheel to go out of true, or it could have damaged the calipers. Take it to a shop to get it inspected before you go on any big rides.  Not sure where you live, but you should take the lane when clear if the bike lane is ending. Always do what's safest for you and those around you."
bikecommuting,39j9fg,Nidht,4,Fri Jun 12 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't get any permanent damage.  One reason for a tight brake can be so silly as brake cable housing/ferrule jumping out of place when (perhaps) your bike violently rotated round your front. If the housing is a little short, turning your bars far enough will pull the housing out of place and then it can get stuck on the side of the support."
bikecommuting,39j9fg,didzisk,2,Fri Jun 12 12:21:53 2015 UTC,Thank you that fixed my brakes. The bars rotated and the cable guide on the fork over grabbed it. So I just pulled it down in place and all good.
bikecommuting,39j9fg,s3rious_simon,5,Sat Jun 13 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"ouch! get well soon!  When crossing curb cuts, avoid doing that in a too pointed angle. Also, when there's nop bike lane, you belong on the road, not on the sidewalk."
bikecommuting,39j9fg,growingupsux,5,Fri Jun 12 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"Also, when there's nop bike lane, you belong on the road, not on the sidewalk.   While most will agree with you, it depends on his speed, his knowledge of the area, the traffic, the time of day, the road condition. There are some parts of my commute that I refuse to ride on the street due to the condition of the road, and the volume of traffic and prefer to to ride on the in better condition doublewide sidewalk with clear views for dozens of yards and next to no foot traffic due to the time of day that I ride."
bikecommuting,39j9fg,grandzooby,2,Fri Jun 12 13:41:25 2015 UTC,Thanks all. I am getting better.  If the pain didn't reside I was going to go to the hospital. Things are healing up. Anyways lesson learned... I should have took the curb cut at a larger angle. My bike has 2.2 slicks so they are fatter so I thought it would roll right over.
bikecommuting,39j9fg,exFAL,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"Too late now, but did you consider calling a cab to get you and your bike home?  Riding injured like that could make the injuries worse.  I know how easy it is to get single-tracked and not think of something like calling a cab."
bikecommuting,39gc6r,_toro,3,Thu Jun 11 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"That seems pretty fast? I'm 10 miles away and it takes me 1 hour. Generally flat, but a very slight incline for part of it. I have an old cross/street bike and I think I need a road bike like yours. Anyway, congratulations. I bet it feels good."
bikecommuting,39gc6r,Intuit302,2,Thu Jun 11 16:14:10 2015 UTC,On par with my commute (well double) - Just over 7 hilly miles and takes me 30 minutes.  I ride a cross bike w/ backpack.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,darkadious,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:21:29 2015 UTC,That's not bad. Good to know.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,Intuit302,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:19:56 2015 UTC,Assuming you sweat like I do. I have a question. So I get to work shower and change. My bib and Jersey  go into my backpack and stay sweaty all day and slightly unpleasant to put it on again at the end of the day. Is it just something I deal with or is there a better solution?
bikecommuting,39gc6r,MustGetALife,3,Fri Jun 12 01:01:41 2015 UTC,Don't put them in a backpack. Hang them up somewhere so they can air dry.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,exFAL,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:20:38 2015 UTC,If you can lay them out in a desk drawer or really anywhere where it will air out even a little it won't be nearly as rank by the end of the day.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,clausy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"If you store the bike indoors at work, hang your clothes over it!"

bikecommuting,39gc6r,yakkafoobmog,3,Fri Jun 12 08:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah you need a road bike. I average 14mph in London traffic on a fixed gear :-)  Hey OP, where are you and what sort of route is it? You must already be biking at weekends if you're averaging over 14mph."
bikecommuting,39gc6r,fdtc_skolar,5,Thu Jun 11 18:23:15 2015 UTC,I'm in Philadelphia. I've been biking for a little over a year. This is the first time that I had the chance to commute to work. New job and they have bike lockers inside the building plus showers. I will be doing it once a week.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,peteftw,3,Thu Jun 11 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Awesome. Sounds great.  Soon it will be twice a week... And it's downhill from there :-)
bikecommuting,39gc6r,kwitcherbichen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:34:57 2015 UTC,Yep. Haven't taken the bus in over two months.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,latteteen,2,Thu Jun 11 21:06:33 2015 UTC,I've driven to work once since the first of May (and regretted not riding that day).
bikecommuting,39gc6r,itsmhuang,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:40:27 2015 UTC,365 life. I haven't taken a non bike in a really long time. My car only gets 1k miles per year.

bikecommuting,39gc6r,and_one_more_thing,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:54:41 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I wish I had bike lockers and showers at my work. Definitely makes commuting by bike more doable!
bikecommuting,39gc6r,Mship2,2,Fri Jun 12 01:45:51 2015 UTC,Certainly worth shaving time off long commute rides. A little more time to sleep in the morning or start work early and leave earlier. Time is money. And time is...time...for other things.
bikecommuting,39gc6r,kwitcherbichen,2,Thu Jun 11 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on my road bike I average about 18mph, 19mph+ on a good day from Kingston to bank. 15.5 mile commute takes about an hour, mornings are always slightly slower though!"

bikecommuting,39gc6r,trainwrecktourist,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:07:13 2015 UTC,+1. I'm 5.1 miles and it takes me 26 minutes door-to-door. I lose all my time in mid-town.
