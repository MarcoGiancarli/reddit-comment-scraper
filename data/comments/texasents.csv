We lived in Florida, near all of my family, but they showed no interest, so we moved out here, where my wife grew up.   It's an interesting area, just haven't seen much to do. We don't have a vehicle, so we're fairly limited on what we see around here. Though, my wife swears there's a lot."

texasents,3dvud4,HooliganAbroad,20,Sun Jul 19 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"Above all else, be mindful of your surroundings. Test the water. See if anyone else is openly smoking (pretty common, especially at larger events), watch security and see how they respond to those openly smoking (they usually don't care as long as you're not behaving in a way that would disturb others), and lastly, be respectful of others that may not want to be inhaling your secondhand smoke (avoid lighting up in tightly-packed crowds and areas with children, if there are any present). If you really want to minimize your chances of offending anyone, take a portable vape, or better yet, edibles. I went to ACL last year with a few brownies in my system, and I was stoned off my ass for the whole day. By far the safest and most hassle-free route to take."

It’s a business and needs to be run like a business,” he said. “I have a background in law enforcement and a background in business. I’m the only candidate with a degree and federal and military background.” ...  He advocates employing narcotics officers on Interstate 35 to catch drug dealers from Mexico before they are caught in Oklahoma and Kansas. He’d like any new jails to be built higher to more easily thwart escapes. And he wants to better protect children from sex offenders who he feels aren’t being followed enough."

texasents,3alfv1,godofallcows,3,Sun Jun 21 10:38:40 2015 UTC,"There should be some sort of disclaimer and an explanation between the damage of the properties of smoke to the lungs versus THC found in weed to the lungs. Smoke is bad for your respiratory system but weed (THC specifically) shouldn't be grouped into ""smoke"". Yes, it's the most common way (as of now) to consume THC but with edibles and drinks becoming more and more popular. The title is a little misleading."
texasents,3alfv1,MegaSketchbook,5,Sun Jun 21 22:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not ready to get onboard with the ""smoking doesn't do anything bad to your lungs"" bandwagon until there's more research (which is hampered by it being a schedule 1 drug). As an advocate of legalizing it for medical reasons, I'd feel more comfortable if we can educate people about how easy it is to use vaporizers or edibles to avoid combustion."
texasents,3alfv1,Xkot,2,Sun Jun 21 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think they mean to say that it does no harm.  They say that there have been many studies showing no positive correlation between marijuana smoking and cancer, which indicates a need for further study.  To this day, marijuana research is held back in the United States of America because some old people are apparently still afraid that the Chinese will use it to bring their Opium Wars here.  I'm an advocate for reasonable policy.  Thing is, the research climate in the US where this plant is concerned, is held back by a mentality predating the discovery of the semiconductor.  We're not a bunch of backward, cave-dwelling shepherds cringing at the thunder.  We should be capable of settling questions like this with research not tainted by political bullshit.  Generally, I would not advise those with pulmonary problems to smoke anything, pot included.  But any time conflicting research results are left unsettled for this long, it's an indication that someone is pissing in the test tubes.  And the people doing the pissing are so far behind that we're still waiting for them to react to Elvis' hips.  If you want a frame of reference to see how screwed this really is, go out and buy a pack of Dark Horse mini cigars.  If you can make it through one without hacking up a lung, you deserve a trophy.  Keep in mind during this experiment that they're sold for about a buck a pack.  I could have bought a carton of them with my lunch money as a kid.  So, when people cite lung concerns or ""think of the children"" to hold back research, I'm more than a little skeptical that they're genuine."
texasents,3alfv1,insomnia_shipping,3,Sun Jun 21 21:57:50 2015 UTC,But it's not like it hadn't been used for thousands of years. I have yet to find someone with any kind of lung disease who only smokes pot. There would be overwhelming evidence showing that a large number of pot-only smokers' health would be compromised. I'm not a scientist but I can see the clear difference in pot vs tobacco smokers' lung health

I'm supposed to just have mental issues and back/sciatica pain, dammit!  ""An August 2000 story in The Dallas Morning News detailed a ruling by a judge that Travis lied in a field report that led to the 1996 conviction of a man on narcotics charges. The judge ordered the release of the defendant after he served four years in prison, and in 1997 charges were dropped against two co-defendants after a prosecutor found a discrepancy in information in Travis’ field report and other evidence. Travis resigned soon after that. He said he needed to spend more time with his daughter and he became a businessman.""  He also has a chemistry minor. He owns Diamond T Arena and a business called X-Ray Business Solutions that falls under a corporation he has with his wife, C&W Travis Corporation. His wife owns CT Enterprises, LLC which is partnered with a business called Danilou Holdings, Ltd. His daddy was a judge in Missisipi.  ""he joined with several other people to create X-Ray Business Solutions, a capital venture company that initially invested in exploding economies in China, Brazil and Russia.""  How american of you, sheriff! Good to know your fortunes are hard earned American dollars. I think I'm going to start referring to him as a foreign investor from now on.   Danilou Holding owns thousands of shares of stock in Fushi International, the biggest owners of stocks there are all from Dallas. It was called Parallel Technologies, INC before doing the corporation shuffle and merging with Fushi. It's a company that works with data cables. The timeline of the investment might fit along with his stint in Dallas, but this could all be boring legal mumbo jumbo and they are clean as a whistle. No idea who owns Danilou.   There's also Tracy Murphy who is running for sheriff, but I'm confused at the timeline and when the election is/was. Either way I asked him his stance publicly and he seems to get involved with the comments on his page.   https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tracy-Murphree-for-Sheriff/1814351868789149?fref=nf  He also has a Fisk thing going on, so that's kind of badass/scary."

While there are a few libertarian gems floating out there in the sea of diarrhea that is the GOP, it the diarrhea:gem ratio remains unfavorable.    I think it's safe to say that the GOP will remain a party of insufferable cunts for the foreseeable future, if its own increasing irrelevancy doesn't lead to its ultimate dissolution first.    But then again, the real powers in the world need to maintain the illusion that ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" people ultimately want different things out of life and are at odds with one another in order to keep us sufficiently distracted, fighting against each other instead of uniting against them.  So if legalization is something they can throw to the ""conservative"" party to maintain its relevance and prolong the illusion for a few more years, I wouldn't put it past them, cognitive dissonance be damned."

texasents,3946yg,Protectorateusa,3,Tue Jun 9 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"I encourage you to register to vote (if not already).  Find your current representatives for your district, there are several websites you can look up this information by typing in your address.  Get others involved. This is a grassroots movement and needs to remain being fed by the people, not professional lobbyists. Remain informed of who your candidates are and voting deadlines.  The voter initiative is nice, however it requires a change to our constitution. That means in 2017 a legislator can propose a bill, it must pass, then in 2019 voters can vote to approve the amendment, and finally it goes into effect. (Going off memory for this, feel free to correct me.)   Edit:  source http://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Constitution"
texasents,3946yg,Sidhe22,3,Tue Jun 9 13:21:04 2015 UTC,"As a start you can get an overview on her here: http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=64     Official Facebook,Website State level House of Representatives isn't a very high bar realistically. (With a 7k salary the position is very much meant to be part time and easily replaceable.)     So that's the carrot, what about the stick? Her opposition was as follows in the last election: Emy Lyons (D): A registered nurse with 10 years experience, and a graduate from North Central Texas College. No website, but a fairly sparse linkedin can be found here. I can't find much and I know uni student's with stronger twitter profiles. However, even so running as an openly gay candidate in a conservative part of Texas with no apparent support or experience she brought down 1/3rd of the vote.    Read King (R), a more realistic option, who nearly took her spot in the Republican primaries with 45%. King appears to be a Tea Party Republican with Libertarian leanings. While a bit out there on a few other issues, he could be useful in ending the federal government's War on Drugs if framed as such. (Mitigating the massive drug war on our southern border would go a long way for border security as well.) This is a lot more useful, since very few people vote in the primaries. (When I tried to follow the link for the data from the Texas Secretary of State I got a 404 file not found error error because literally no one gives a shit.)    The way I see it, forming a Political Action Committee to support candidates for her removal would go a long way. She's been an incumbent for a number of terms but her seat is getting very wobbly. Denton is one of the fastest growing (changing) metropolitan areas in Texas, and has a huge student population. University of North Texas has about 36,000 students, and I'm sure some of them would love to put experience from a PAC on their resume. Particularly if they can be paid in experience working for a cause they believe in without having to put 'marijuana' on their resume."

Before someone passes judgement on others, they should have the sense to experience what its like to live in their shoes.  I would love to invite this person over to share a bowl with me, so I can help him understand that he is passing judgement on a substance that he knows very little about.

Not only that, but I'm absolutely convinced that the government reaps many benefits from the cartels. I'm assuming mostly financial.   If it was as simple as jobs lost, they could transfer DEA to work for ATF (which I assume would regulate marijuana if it was treated like drugs and cigarettes), since they would ""need"" more people to oversee the marijuana industry.   There's no logical reason why any official wouldn't pass a bill legalizing after seeing how well the other legal states are doing. It defies scientific evidence and common sense.

For much of the 20th century, Baptists and other evangelical Christians were prominent in political activism for Sunday closing laws restricting the sale of alcohol. Bootleggers sold alcohol illegally, and got more business if legal sales were restricted.  “Such a coalition makes it easier for politicians to favor both groups. … [T]he Baptists lower the costs of favor-seeking for the bootleggers, because politicians can pose as being motivated purely by the public interest even while they promote the interests of well-funded businesses. … [Baptists] take the moral high ground, while the bootleggers persuade the politicians quietly, behind closed doors.”      Interesting: Rum-running | Dry county | Cannabis Social Club | Regulation   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Not later than September 1, 2017, DPS shall license at least 3 dispensing organizations, as long as there are at least 3 applicants that meet the criteria.   Also, as a nifty side note, because both houses gave two-thirds vote, the bill was put into effect immediately. Abbott's signature was just for show as it wasn't needed to finalize the law."
texasents,386knl,Sidhe22,3,Tue Jun 2 13:32:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is that, as of now, this bill can't be used by anyone at all.  It says that CBD oil can be ""prescribed"", but prescriptions go through federal jurisdiction, not state, and marijuana in any form is illegal on a federal level.  Therefore, this bill would require doctors to risk losing their medical licenses to prescribe CBD oil, which no doctor is going to willingly do.  It was supposed to be amended to say ""recommended"" instead of ""prescribed"", which would have allowed doctors to legally recommend CBD oil, but it was never changed.  I've seen 2017 or 2018 as the year that this bill will go into effect, but the only way this bill will help anyone is if marijuana is legalized federally or at least taken off the Schedule I drugs list.  So maybe just stick to growing for yourself until things change on a federal level."
texasents,386knl,kkillian14,2,Tue Jun 2 08:31:20 2015 UTC,They can't prescribe it right now but there's a drug called Epidiolex which is getting fast tracked through FDA approval as an orphan drug. It's supposed to be an alternative to the Charlotte's web oil . . . How much do you wanna bet it will be approved in time for this bill's implementation?
texasents,386knl,kkillian14,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, good, but it still has to be a last resort option to be prescribed, according to this law.  But then I wonder what's the point of specifying that at least 3 dispensing organizations need to be licensed?  If there's going to be a federally approved CBD oil with a drug name wouldn't it just be carried in regular pharmacies?  Nothing about the way SB 339 was written makes sense to me."
texasents,386knl,carne_diem,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"If it gets FDA approval then yes it'll be available in pharmacies and shouldn't be required to go through a dispensary. You're right, the bill doesn't make sense - I wonder if there was some other goal for the legislation."
texasents,386knl,StitchDaddy,2,Fri Jun 5 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"But this is a CBD oil we're talking about here, not the plant. In medical states, doctors can recommend the plant. In Texas, we have dronabinol, a federally approved drug that contains THC that is often prescribed to patients in chemotherapy, and any patient who could benefit from it if the doctor agrees (edit: only as a last resort, and insurance won't cover it). So since this bill would allow pharmaceutical companies to create a medication containing CBD oil, is this really an issue? Would a doctor actually be in danger of losing his or her license for prescribing a lab-created medication in a form that was just declared legal?   Sorry if my understanding is completely incorrect, this is an honest question. I haven't had much luck getting clarity on this grey area and I'd really like to learn a bit more."
texasents,386knl,StitchDaddy,2,Tue Jun 2 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know.  Everything I've read tells me that this bill is useless, but maybe you're right.  But even if they can actually prescribe it, it can't be done until it's a last resort, so it's still a law that's set up to be pretty useless regardless of legality.  This is exactly why Marijuana needs to be taken off the Schedule I drugs list and made legal federally.  In addition, concentrates shouldn't be considered a seperate thing from the plant.  The way things are now is too confusing and I don't understand why that needs to be the case.  The US is ready for Marijuana, just let us have it."
texasents,386knl,StitchDaddy,2,Tue Jun 2 19:14:07 2015 UTC,I thought medicinal was legalized on the federal level. Also then how does medical cannabis work in other states like Cali where you have to get a prescription.
texasents,386knl,Sidhe22,2,Tue Jun 2 13:09:58 2015 UTC,"No, Marijuana In any form isn't federally legal. Marijuana is still listed as a Schedule I drug amongst meth and cocaine, despite being a million times safer.  California doesn't use ""prescriptions"", it uses ""recommendations"", same as any other medical only state.  Language use is extremely specific when writing a bill and this bill was supposed to be amended to say ""recommended"" instead of ""prescribed"" but it didn't happen and it is now useless.   So yes, our reps and Governor passed a bill into law knowing that it does nothing.  I think it's the ONLY reason it went through, personally, because now our state government has just tricked a large majority of people into believing they listened to us while not actually changing anything and they see that as a win (Not all reps, of course, I think at least a few actually care).

But that's from the internet so...   A quick glance through the bill leads me to believe that it's a huge pain in the ass to dispense it; everyone in the business must be registered with the state, it's up to the state to decide if you possess the tech to cultivate and grow low-THC cannabis, etc. It looks like the Dr. would have to register for every patient/prescription."
texasents,384nwb,strugglz,12,Mon Jun 1 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"It truly doesn't do anything because of the way it's written.  It says that low THC oil can be ""prescribed"", but if a doctor actually prescribed CBD oil they would lose their license because prescriptions go through federal jurisdiction, not state, and as we all know, marijuana is illegal in ANY form federally as of now.  The states that CAN dispense CBD oil can only do so because their laws say ""recommended"" rather than ""prescribed"".  This bill was supposed to be amended to say ""recommended"" but that didn't end up happening and now it's useless.  I'm sure it was only passed BECAUSE it's useless.

texasents,380zfb,scarypandabear,9,Mon Jun 1 07:21:47 2015 UTC,This bill will not help anyone. Unless a doctor has authorization from the DEA to prescribe schedule 1 drugs(hint: none can) then they cant prescribe it. While yes it is a victory for legalization it we still have a very long way to go.
texasents,380zfb,godofallcows,2,Mon Jun 1 04:17:37 2015 UTC,I thought that this bill had been amended to say recommendation instead of prescription for this very reason.  If it really does still say prescription then what's the point of even turning this bill into law?
texasents,380zfb,scarypandabear,3,Mon Jun 1 04:54:18 2015 UTC,The amendments were held off on and the reason for the bill is to at least get our foot in the door. No longer can 'its dangerous to children' work as the prohibitionists platform. 2017 is going to be a very important year.
texasents,380zfb,jerkiusmaximus2,6,Mon Jun 1 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"Wow.  WOW.  So they're really passing a bill (that was pretty useless in the first place) that will give false hope to the few families it could have helped?  I can see that it's going to help give real medical and legalization a chance, but it's not right to pass this bill that will literally help no one.   I hate this fucking state, I really do."

The only reason it has passed is because it does nothing and they all know it.   I do vote.  It's been proven that voting doesn't do all that much, but I do vote.

texasents,37ofz9,Trespasser77,1 point,Fri May 29 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"by the way, did anyone notice that the bill actually redefines ""medical use"" as not smoking it AND by ""low-THC""?   ""(4) AA""Medical use"" means the ingestion by a means of administration other than by smoking of a prescribed amount of low-THC  cannabis  by  a  person  for  whom  low-THC  cannabis  is prescribed under this chapter.  (5) AA""Smoking"" means burning or igniting a substance and inhaling the smoke.""  Hopefully this isn't a sneaky tactic to make legit, legalized medical use null and void in our state.  Of course, this could also be referring solely to the particular bill in question and not the ""compassionate care"" platform as a whole."
texasents,37ofz9,WhistlersBrother,2,Sat May 30 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if Memorial Day counts towards the 10-day limit to sign or veto?  The Texas Constitution excepts Sundays from the day count, which puts the 10th day at June 1st, the last day of the session.  If Memorial Day doesn't count, then the deadline is June 2nd, which is after adjournment and the deadline to sign or veto becomes June 21st.

I do believe a few places have maybe a City ordnance or something to decriminalize in there districts. Not sure how that works...

Well, the holdup is basically that they are not prepared to acknowledge that cannabis or any derivatives thereof have health benefits of any kind. The fact that THC has federally acknowledged health benefits, or that CBD oil is non-psychoactive and won't be diverted to recreational use is irrelevant to them, because facts are not really part of the picture. You can read up on some of the statements by legislators and the sheriffs associations (who were really the main public opponents in the local media, IMO) to confirm this."

The CBD bill requires a doctor to ""prescribe"" medicine which is not the same as a recommendation as /u/cashmoneywhale stated.   What this bill does do that will make a difference however, is it requires the state to set up a marijuana regulatory agency sometime before the 2017 deadline as stated in the bill. This means, when the legislature comes back in 2017, there will be an agency ready to go and we can start making real MMJ legislation with no waiting time for them to ""figure things out"""

texasents,36eg9n,wrdcttn,7,Mon May 18 20:59:58 2015 UTC,Since it's El Paso you're going to want to bring as much of your own weed since quality is expensive there & there's really not much to do. I think you can mail it to yourself through USPS just look up how to properly package it so it doesn't smell that much.  Enjoy your time there even though there's not much to do in that city.
texasents,36eg9n,Exastii,3,Mon May 18 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"Please do not use usps. I've sent shit using FedEx multiple times with no problems. Pay cash for overnight delivery and get some zip lock mylar bags off the Internet. What I used to do is put product in 1 mylar bag, seal it, wipe every square inch of it with alcohol, then put that bag in another mylar bag, seal and it's ready to ship. I used padded envelopes."
texasents,36eg9n,regal8r,2,Mon May 18 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"Also never use your full legal name or the recipients legal name if you're shipping to someone other than yourself.

texasents,36eg9n,regal8r,2,Wed May 20 07:37:24 2015 UTC,"Those are great instructions for mailing them (or taking them in the car, imo).  OP, the wiping with alcohol is so tiny crystals don't get on the package & make the dogs alert to it while it's in transit.  Putting on gloves to handle the bags can work, too.     As far as I know, there are pros & cons with sending it via FedEx.  Pro is it's not as big a crime as using the USPS.  Con is they can search & open anything they suspect has illegal things in it.  With USPS, I think they need a warrant before they can open it.  I'm not entirely sure."
texasents,36eg9n,chomatos,6,Tue May 19 13:17:59 2015 UTC,There was a thread here a while ago where people were advising others not to use Fedex or UPS because they sometimes did contact the police if they smelled anything. I'm pretty sure USPS was the safe one where they don't check.
texasents,36eg9n,Exastii,2,Mon May 18 22:09:50 2015 UTC,If they smell anything it's bc you fucked up and didn't take the necessary precautions IMO
texasents,36eg9n,regal8r,5,Wed May 20 07:33:38 2015 UTC,"This is correct, I used to receive weed, edibles, and acid via USPS all the time via the silk road, never bothered with rush shipping or anything, and as long as you don't sign for your package you are safe. What they do if they suspect anything is open your package, inspect it, and then if they find drugs, they will reseal it in such a way that you would never suspect a thing. They will have an undercover agent deliver the package to you, hand it to you personally, and then ask you to sign for the package. They'll give you enough time to get inside and open the package before entering the house and arresting you with a felony. Signing for the package legally makes it yours, so by doing so you are taking responsibility for the contents of the package. I don't remember the source, but a year or two ago some famous baseball player got busted because his wife didn't know and signed for a package he ordered on Silk Road, so you just have to be careful. Vacuum seal your weed at least twice and you won't have to worry about anything as long as you are careful about getting weed around the outside of the packaging, but even then it is very unlikely that the package would get picked up. Also, just like /u/regal8r said, it always arrived in padded envelopes. One time I got a box, but that was for a large order."
texasents,36eg9n,Humans_Are_Weird,2,Mon May 18 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"I've heard stories about usps x-ray in packages, not sure if there's any truth to it or not. As far as overnight shipping, it's probably not necessary but the added peace of mind is worth it for me..it ensures that the least amount of people are handling the package."
texasents,36eg9n,regal8r,8,Wed May 20 07:30:51 2015 UTC,"It is not really like that so much anymore. Most of the time a small amount will get you a fine. Here is a link with real info  It is also a stereo type that all Texas pot comes from cartels. There are many, many growers here. Texas is slowly but surely liberalizing its pot laws and many law enforcement types aren't all that interested in ruining someones life over pot."

Bush was elected Governor in 1994, he allowed the state’s Republican Party to remove the pro I&R plank from the Party’s platform and replace it with an anti I&R platform. This change effectively ended any chances of I&R being adopted in the state for the foreseeable future.

texasents,35x54h,SmegmaSundae,2,Thu May 14 06:30:29 2015 UTC,"The way I see things is this.  HB 2165 running through the whole ringer should not be the focal point of concern, because--while it is--the situation is one that encourages a shifting of the public narrative toward negativity on the subject.  I see nothing but wins so far, and still see no reason to be anything short of enthusiastic about our prospects ahead.  Here is a simple break down of my thought process:  1)  The end of marijuana prohibition will be the defining moment determining long-term party loyalists amongst the millenials.  This is not really a question anymore.  As such, Texas (with its significance in terms of the American cultural identity) provides a unique opportunity for the pro-active party on this matter in this state to fire the opening salvo of election season 2016.  Republicans +Marijuana +Texas = Democrats Suck, George Bush Who?   Or, the Democratic Party could usurp the national stage in the name of liberty and rational bipartisanship.  Both parties stand to win big right here and right now.  The only question is who will beat whom to the prize...  We need to convey that today.  2)  Given the current political climate, I would like to know what the hurdles would be to inserting the simple language ""marihuana struck from..."" as an amendment to another pro-marijuana bill.  We're not really talking about crafting new legislation anyway, but rather amending existing code, right?  Who will do it?  If no one will, why not?  Introducing the language of HB 2165 as a bill to committee made the headlines and put Texas in the spotlight.  It also energized and motivated large segments of the public, and that got everyone paying attention.   Is that not enough to justify trying?  3) All of this said, it is time to use the governor's words against him.  If there's no time, he's the one person who can constitutionally insist that the legislature make time.  If the will of Texans (his words) has changed in favor of ending prohibition, then he needs to make it happen.  If he wants to fight for Texans' civil liberties as he has claimed with the Jade Helm exercises, then he needs to put his money where his mouth is.  Even if that means Texans demand a special session.  If not, why not?"

If you are against drug legalization than you're supporting rape and murder.   This is one of the stupidest things I've ever read.  If you want to be angry that no change is happening, that's fine, I am too.  But seriously think about what you just said there.  What's next?  People who are pro-choice take pleasure in murdering babies and support genocide?  My 63 year old mother is against legalization.  Why?  No, she isn't supporting the cartels. And no, she is certainly not pro-rape.  We've had discussions about this, and she doesn't support legalization mainly because she doesn't want easy access to another drug that might impair driving.  Is that a good reason?  No.. I've tried to drill it in that people are (and have always been) using it regardless of its legal status.  But it's a reason nonetheless.   People who don't share your opinion have their own reasons, no matter how good or piss poor they may be."

texasents,35wf1z,Shesheasha,2,Thu May 14 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. If you're uneducated about the benefits of taking business away from the cartel, it makes you ignorant to the repercussions of keeping marijuana illegal and under the control of the cartels.   Ignorance isn't a good excuse. If you're not supporting the safe and legal growing and distributing of marijuana, then you're supporting the illegal, potentially dangerous growing and distribution of marijuana.   Legalizing marijuana promotes safe growing practices, a safe place to distribute and a choice of what strain you're getting that best suits your needs (or pleasures). It takes business from the cartels, because most people would prefer a legal and safe means of obtaining their pot. Forcing out the illegal practices cuts down on the availability to minors, cuts down on crime, increases tax revenue and eliminates wasteful spending of taxes of the incarceration of non-violent ""offenders"".   Anyone who doesn't agree with marijuana legalization hasn't done their research. Saying they don't agree with legalization because of impaired driving is an uninformed and ridiculous reason. So if you haven't done your research on the pros and cons of marijuana and list pointless reasons for continuing prohibition, I assume you're siding with the violence and illegality of the cartels. I wouldn't straight up say ""you support rape and murder!"" but in a way...you do."

She said they didn't even talk about it because they had a lot on their plate for that particular meeting and apparently the other bills took priority.  I did call Representative Simpsons office a few minutes ago. Apparently he's on the house floor at the moment, but I did leave him a message with the woman working his phone. I asked her to tell him that while I disagree with some of his policies (I'm not a Republican nor a tea party conservative. Heck, I haven't even smoked pot in 5 years and won't until it's legal for me to do so) I believe he is a good man and that I can tell he wants what's best not only for the people, but for the state of Texas as a whole. HB 2165 was something I wholeheartedly agreed with and while I'm sorry it didn't make it, I hope he runs again come election time and that he files the bill again during the next cycle.  He and I may not see eye to eye on every issue or even most issues, but I do think he's a good man for the job. Politicians views will never align 100% with the general populous. The law of probabilities as well as free thought just won't allow it. I'm a realist. But that being said, I really do hope he tries again when the time comes.  Maybe others can give him a call and offer words of encouragement. I'm sure he's disheartened at the moment, but I think we can all agree that we don't want him to give up. Politicians that don't toe their respective party lines are few and far between. Show him that he has support and that people do care about this.

texasents,35tks0,TheBrownKnight210,1 point,Thu May 14 09:39:21 2015 UTC,"Here's a sample of her talking points. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgb1pasiIRE&feature=youtu.be&t=53s    You can tell how she presents herself and her inflection she's only interested in money, and doesn't give half a shit about the sob stories of poor people. (She uses the example that Texas's triple-A bond rating invalidated accusations that her tax policy would leave people to die. Her words)     Here are some rough talking points I would have for talking with her base:     It's time to end the federal government's failed War on Drugs. The federal government's failed policies cost us simply too much, DC can't expect us to foot the bill for their mistakes. It costs tax payers $60,000 to $80,000 a year to house non-violent drug offenders. There is a massive active drug war along our southern border. Texas standing up to the fed's misguided policies would be an extraordinary measure in kicking the financial legs out from under the cartels and would drastically help us secure our southern border. The federal government wants to allow their agents extraordinary power to investigate Texans in the name of their corrupt War on Drugs. (Point to DEA corruption, i.e. the thousands in BTC stolen by agents during the Silk Road investigation, the mishandling of Fast and Furious, various and numerous other DEA misconduct scandals.) Colorado has brought in a ton of tax revenue, so much that they've had to give rebates to citizens. There is a massive coalition of Texas sheriffs that are opposed to making arrests for marijuana. Eliminating the need for these arrests would allow police to get on with their job of keeping communities safe. Washington DC has already decriminalized. Why would we allow the hypocrites in DC push policy on Texans that destroys the lives of our children and puts the communities on our border at risk of violence, when they're not willing to abide by that prohibition themselves. Why would we allow corrupt DC prison lobbyists to push policies on Texans that force us to turn returning veterans dealing with PTSD and chronic pain into criminals.   Her base supports her on the grounds that she's hypothetically fiscally responsible to the upper class and is willing to stand up to DC. If we can highlight the real fact that she's out of touch with current events, corrupted by big interests (and by extension DC), and show her general callousness extends to even veterans and youth we could resonate with her base and cause some serious damage to her campaign."

texasents,35tks0,Poden123456,3,Wed May 13 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"Source: A denton constituent from FB  ""Just got a call from Myra Crownover's office. Had a long talk with Craig Holhissier (Im sure I spelled that wrong) He said, some of her major concerns and thought's are:   HB3785 did not address the banking issues legalization would create as long as marijuana is a schedule 1 drug. The Banking Secrecy Act He said some of the doctors at the hearing had concerns with everyone claiming cannabis cure everything from rashes to long term erections. They want to see proper testing on a federal level to know what cannabis has the potential to cure and what mask symptoms. She will support a bill that will address the possible downfalls that the other bills did not. He also mentioned she is a mother of 4 who's husband died early in their marriage from a disease that cannabis could have possibly helped with. He says she is sympathetic to our cause but those bills simply didn't address all her concerns for her constituents. He also expressed how if the president would take the action needed a lot of the problems on a state level would no longer be an issue.""   Here's my analysis and initial round of rebuttals, and take this with a grain of salt because I'm probably moving to her district this fall to help take her down:   So let me tell you about the first two bullet points. Anyone who has spent more than 2 hours thinking about, and actually planning a cannabusiness for when our time comes, has reviewed the banking and tax law issues that we face. We're perfectly well aware.  Banking obstacles are a big deal right now that most people aren't aware of. It is probably my biggest obstacle with local investors right now for the business plan I'm working on. People in Legal states are having big problems taking care of their scrooge mcduck piles of money. Most of these guys are having to deal completely in cash and having to reinvest in assets that could get broken or stolen. The bank accounts they can get are in kind of a ""don't ask, don't tell"" situation.    The studies and science exists. The proper testing has been done, and many more are in progress, as more studies come out, more conditions can be added to the approved list. It shows her unfamiliarity with the issue if the approved condition list is conflicting what people are talking about. When I reel off conditions that should be on the list, I'm pulling 20+ things that have actual basis in fact from studdies. Would she be interested in being involved in the bill authoring process to address her concerns? Then help us overcome the objections by being part of the solution to prevent this from happening to someone else. You had the ability to suggest amendments in your report. This is a states rights issue primarily. Point is invalid if i can move to another state and magically not be a criminal because of geography. The problem right now isn't the president. It's the states. If she is a true conservative, and not just a Republican In Name Only, she would be excited about federal deferring to states rights and decisions. He has deferred this to the individual states for the time being, because this is an evolving issue. Once about 3/4 of the states have flipped to some degree of legalization, it becomes a federal issue that can be acted upon with little to no resistance. It's the safe bet, and in my opinion progress needs to happen on all fronts."

texasents,35pn7m,Phaze9999,2,Tue May 12 14:06:07 2015 UTC,Has anyone found out what impact this cancellation has on the bill?   Was it just cancelled to keep the marijuana bill debates from wiping out the time scheduled for other bills? Or is this a stall tactic? Will these bills be discussed behind closed doors?  I didn't expect it to be debated today but I am still curious about what this signals.
texasents,35pn7m,Superstring4you,1 point,Tue May 12 21:10:44 2015 UTC,They are meeting at 4:40pm today to discuss pending judicial bills.

We should be angry people in front of government buildings (aside from schools, libraries and more family focused areas) if we want to be angry.

Get them out of the way and the marijuana problem goes away. The rest of the movement loses steam because you can say all the health benefits and all the conditions it treats, however without experiencing the symptoms first hand there is not much impact words do. Videos of suffering children is very motivating. Videos of people detailing their hardships not as much of a tear jerk response. Opposition still can say there are other ways to treat your ills, so if you support legalization you must be a hippie stoner.  I also find my family not overly supportive even though they see my suffering. They say, maybe in a few years a new pharmacy drug will come out. I use cannabis everyday, so I must be an addict. I use pharmacy drugs every day too and I have the choice to take more pharmacy drugs to counter the side effects, which would lead to more side effects (I realize I'm probably preaching to the choir here). I choose to suffer rather than pile on more pills. I have a small glimmer of hope at the end of the day when I can truly feel relief using my natural plant alternative."

I have been calling reps, and a lot of the staffers answering the phones just say thank you for your concern, take down my name and zip code (ive been giving them my future zip code since the move has been set in stone for a few months and I already have a house waiting for me there. Just getting my current house packed up) and tell me they will pass along my support to their respective employers. Anyway, I did call Mr. Larson and the staff member I spoke to said Mr. Larson was all for 2165. I suppose that can be taken with a grain of salt, though. I asked the person working the phone for Mr. Lucio about their stance and he said they weren't allowed to speak for their representative (which I completely understand).

What I am afraid this might do, however, is just encourage the cartels to start heating up shipments through Texas.

texasents,35jyzj,Phaze9999,3,Mon May 11 19:21:54 2015 UTC,Synthetic marijuana is indeed some bad stuff. Sadly a lot of people turn to it on the lie that it is similar to marijuana. Synthetics are a very dirty drug and has put a lot of people in the hospital already.  Facts could prove why it needs to be banned. No need for fear tactics.  People really do need to stay away from that stuff.

My SO slapped me hard after about 2 hours in to get me out of it and I felt like I was strait out of Frankenstein rising from the dead. I wake up to my brother still screaming. Worst experience I've ever had. Good thing we lived in the country at the time where no one cared"

texasents,35jyzj,master_west,1 point,Mon May 11 10:27:40 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I was given some synthetic marijuana without being told what it was about a year ago. Ended up waking up in a hospital bed hours later with doctor's pumping air into my face and all sorts of needles and things in my body. Doctors said if my dad hadn't had gotten me to the hospital when he did I would've slipped into a coma and possibly died.   So yeah it's some bad stuff. Never touching it again.
texasents,35jusx,Seanana,3,Mon May 11 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"I can see where HB507 was submitted but it looks like HB2165 still hasn't moved.

My guess on what happened....Hb 507 got the green light in exchange for shutting down 2165. They see that as a compromise. LE still gets to chase after distributors and buyers will be left alone for the most part. They still get their seizure profits and don't have to lose money locking up the smokers. Win Win for opposition and a Win Lose for Supporters  Predictions - HB 507 will pass with a narrow vote to appease both crowds. Hb 2165 will never see the floor.   Voters will be happy one of them passed and won't vote as negatively next round.

You don't have to have a speech because if you do it most likely won't get heard (that's what the hearings are for).   All you have to do is tell them you are a voting Texas citizen of your city or county, especially important if the person you are calling is your rep because you vote for or against them, and that you support HB2165 and HB507 and you think that Representative ______ should as well.

Every poll on this topic is showing overwhelming support and politicians are going to have a hard time ignoring that.

Do you think with the support of Texans, what may have started out as a joke to many legislators, they are now starting to take the topic seriously? Does the movement of the bills signify hope or just a way for politicians to play both angles (vote for a bill but draw it out so long it dies first)? Also, what effects did Gov. Abbott have by coming outright stating marijuana legislation will not be considered this session?"
texasents,358sel,godofallcows,6,Fri May 8 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"They are absolutely taking this issue seriously. We've given them no choice. The grassroots activists throughout Texas have made it known that this is a popular issue and that we are getting organized in our advocacy. This is going to be a campaign issue. Once the session is over, we will be focusing our energy on the election.   Governor Abbott said that it was unlikely, but he did not say that he would veto the bill.

However, the fact is that many Americans don't read the news but they do pay attention to, and are heavily influenced by, entertainment-focused crap,(IMO) like People and TMZ. This kind of campaign targets those people very well.  What would be the best of both worlds, is to have celebrities speak out about how people can get involved and the importance of voting. I think that even if a celebrity endorsement results in only a few thousand extra votes, it's worth it."

texasents,354hwg,Seanana,23,Thu May 7 06:18:30 2015 UTC,"What happens now for HB 2165? =]  Floor Actions  • When a bill comes up for consideration by the full house or senate, it receives its second reading.  • The bill is read, again by caption only, and then debated by the full membership of the chamber.  • Any member may offer an amendment, but it must be approved by a majority of the members present and voting to be adopted.  • The members then vote on whether to pass the bill.  • The bill is then considered by the full body again on third reading and final passage.  • A bill may be amended again on third reading, but amendments at this stage require a two-thirds majority for adoption.  • Although the Texas Constitution requires a bill to be read on three separate days in each house before it can have the force of law, this constitutional rule may be suspended by a four-fifths vote of the house in which the bill is pending. (The house, rarely suspends this provision, and third reading of a bill in the house normally occurs on the day following its second reading consideration.)  • In the house, record votes are tallied by an electronic vote board controlled by buttons on each member's desk.  • If a bill receives a majority vote on third reading, it is considered passed.  • When a bill is passed, in the house, where it originated, the bill is engrossed, and a new copy of the bill which incorporates all corrections and amendments is prepared and sent to the opposite chamber for consideration.  • In the second house, the bill follows basically the same steps it followed in the first house.  • When the bill is passed in the opposite house, it is returned to the originating chamber with any amendments that have been adopted simply attached to the bill.  • If a bill is returned to the originating chamber without amendments, it is put in final form, signed by the speaker and lieutenant governor, and sent to the governor.  .  Yes it looks like a long list. But all this happens in a very short amount of time. To ensure: that we are getting laws based on facts, that we are removing all criminal bias, and that we are being represented: CALL your representative and the members of the calendar committee and urge them to schedule HB 2165 for a vote on the house floor to be sent on to the Senate.  .

texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,2,Thu May 7 08:05:05 2015 UTC,"And most of them smoked it throughout college. I think counties should be able to decide if they want it sold or not as long as they aren't jailing people for it anymore. Communities are what makes your area special and they should be allowed to choose if they want smoking banned indoors, alcohol bans after a certain time, etc. I lived in a dry county that finally allowed beer and wine (still no liquor but its' a 30 minute drive in any direction and if they did allow liquor it would kill the town next to us that has nothing but alcohol stores) and they didn't burn down, in fact it was a lot nicer being able to grab a case of beer on the way home after work, class, etc. And we had a lot less drunk people driving 30 minutes on long straight roads both ways to get the same thing."

texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,8,Thu May 7 03:11:53 2015 UTC,It has to be schedule to be heard on the house by the calendar committee then it has to pass the house. It then goes to the Senate and does the same thing with the committee. Then it goes to the Governor's desk for him to sign. If he doesn't sign it a 2/3 vote is needed to pass it in the House and Senate. It's more detailed than that but that's the simple version.
texasents,354hwg,caesar424,3,Thu May 7 03:20:18 2015 UTC,It still passes if he doesn't sign it. It goes back to House and Senate if he vetoes it.
texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,2,Thu May 7 04:00:20 2015 UTC,If he vetoes it at that point I think another Republican will be stepping in as soon as they can. If he ignores the majority of his state for too long he would be a fool.

texasents,354hwg,SaltinPepper,4,Thu May 7 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"click the first link and punch in the zip code where you live, it will tell you your tx senator and tx representative.  the rep is going to vote on this next, then IF that passes, the senator will vote on it next, then the governor.  if you go to your rep's & senator's websites through the link from punching in ur zip code, you can email them saying ""support HB 2165"" and that's it."
texasents,354hwg,Phaze9999,5,Thu May 7 05:45:35 2015 UTC,Call them all for good measure bruh
texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,11,Thu May 7 04:28:33 2015 UTC,It could happen. Who would have thought it would go this far? This could be the year!
texasents,354hwg,gamersyn,12,Thu May 7 02:06:22 2015 UTC,Wow....never say never folks  Maybe this will make it through in one form or another. At this point I think it is safe to say we will need to double our efforts and not forget just how long of a road this bill has to travel.
texasents,354hwg,titmongerr,18,Thu May 7 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"As much as I want this to pass it did not think it would make it out of the comittee. I still have my doubts that they did this so late that they are trying to save fave knowing it might/will die in calendars. Absolutely awesome though, Texas! Let's get this shit pushed to the end!  /r/texasents!"
texasents,354hwg,NEW_ZEALAND_ROCKS,2,Thu May 7 01:58:53 2015 UTC,How long does it take to die in calendars?
texasents,354hwg,proROKexpat,1 point,Thu May 7 08:42:10 2015 UTC,the last day to schedule bills on the calendar is next Wednesday at midnight.  so anything not scheduled before or by then dies instantly
texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,2,Thu May 7 12:47:02 2015 UTC,I'm not sure but that's how the CJ committee used to always let these bills die. They would just keep tabling them and never have a vote.
texasents,354hwg,proROKexpat,9,Thu May 7 11:24:34 2015 UTC,Its very likely this bill will not become law  But know what? Thats ok! Because we haven't gotten this far again! Lets keep pushing and if it fails we will try again.
texasents,354hwg,Phaze9999,6,Thu May 7 04:27:44 2015 UTC,Damn straight!
texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,6,Thu May 7 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"The powers to be I think have come to the understanding thats its not ""if"" but ""when"""
texasents,354hwg,proROKexpat,14,Thu May 7 04:37:28 2015 UTC,Yes but....  Passing this bill just caused a lot of neutral players to get into the game at all levels. It could cause a snowball effect of support and turn opposing it into a political nightmare.   Right now a lot of Texans are getting used to the idea that we will be the 5th state to legalize marijuana.
texasents,354hwg,flippah254,8,Thu May 7 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"I think the full legalization is a bit too strong to go from 0 to 60 for some Texas counties. Medical allowed in bigger cities will be a lot easier to accept, which is what I want. Decriminalization so that people's lives aren't ruined, medical so that the people suffering can have relief and possible cures or at least assisting in cures. I think Texas can sustain that for a few years, but until we get that no one is stopping and this day and age with the internet there is only so much ""bullshit facting"" they can do to trick people. People have facebook and see these kids who have 100 seizures a week go down to a handful or less."
texasents,354hwg,Phaze9999,5,Thu May 7 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"It would be a huge win, for a state to go straight to legal pot."
texasents,354hwg,boundarydissolver,5,Thu May 7 04:28:39 2015 UTC,when our nation's capital has recreational weed and we dont.... something is wrrrong so why not just go for full legalization  cant turn away from it much longer i say
texasents,354hwg,godofallcows,11,Thu May 7 03:14:07 2015 UTC,Shoot for the moon......  If a majority of people can accept the idea of recreational use then medical will be a guarantee. The stories about families fleeing Texas to Colorado for seizure medication breaks my heart. Just how effective it is at curing their seizures is nothing short of amazing.  We are in the same camp of thought. I understand my need to come home and smoke a joint to relax comes last on the importance meter right now.
texasents,354hwg,imthegirl,3,Thu May 7 02:47:28 2015 UTC,Also understand that your choice to do so is in itself an inherit right that no one should be able to take away from you. Pursuit of happiness.
texasents,354hwg,regal8r,8,Thu May 7 10:17:23 2015 UTC,Eventually they got there and we have arguments on the internet about phrasing of his first words. I think we just need to vote Willie into the Governor's house.   Not to mention the pressure on the white house to reschedule. If that happens Texas will probably change it's direction swiftly on both platforms.
texasents,354hwg,Phaze9999,53,Thu May 7 02:49:00 2015 UTC,first you three need to change your language...   first it was no one was ever going to introduce a legalization bill...  then it was no one was going to back it..   then it was never going to get out of CJ committee..   we have a LOT of work left to do.. so don't use such defeatist language..   there is NO OTHER direction cannabis law can go in Texas.. there is far too much evidence our legislators can not ignore any more.. .  i will have a list of names soon for you to call so you can help..  LET'S GET LEGAL IN TEXAS IN 2015!!!!
texasents,354hwg,Superstring4you,9,Thu May 7 01:46:43 2015 UTC,Exactly what I keep saying. Negative attitudes are one of the only reasons why it hasn't been legalized already...

They main purpose here I believe is to get the pot stirring, get em talking about it and let them know we are serious. Mention leverage points such as appealing to young voters, more goods to tax, etc. Also, if you can do the research, find out what your representative does have power in. For instance one of my representatives is on the health committee, so when I call I will try to relate it in their favor rather  than just letting them know what is going on in another committee.

A bill filed in one chamber that is identical or very similar to a bill filed in the opposite chamber. Companion bills are used to expedite passage as they provide a means for committee consideration of a measure to occur in both houses simultaneously. A companion bill that has passed one house can then be substituted for the companion bill in the second house."

The committee members voice their support but there is no vote.   Most representative offices will just pass on a note of support, but you can also give opinions if you'd like.  I wrote out a few big points:   Cartels taking a bit hit (especially since we're in Texas near the border), I compare it to the mafia during the Prohibition era. When prohibition was repealed, they had to move into another business or they would have died out. They moved to drug trafficking and gambling.   What if marijuana was taken out of that drug trafficking equation? I bet it would have hurt them badly, like it WILL hurt the cartels since marijuana is the primary drug in their business.   Also that the war on drugs is a failure as seen by the DEA sex party scandal and Lionheart's resignation. Refuse to continue wasting money and resources on criminal marijuana enforcement.  I also learned that Austin Police Department already does something similar to HB507, possession under 5g is just a ticket. Had no idea. Bring that up."

texasents,34nrne,godofallcows,6,Sat May 2 21:21:08 2015 UTC,The article says a few of the reps weren't present for the vote. I'm just wondering why our elected officials aren't even showing up to do the jobs we've trusted them with.

texasents,34nrne,Phaze9999,3,Sun May 3 12:11:04 2015 UTC,"On the plus side, these bills are drawing out the old blood still in power and forcing them to show how ignorant they are on modern issues.   Right now marijuana legalization polls better than any candidate will in the next election cycle. It is obvious that this issue crosses party lines, age and race. People want it legalized and they will show it next election cycle.  What is worse are the several reps that didn't even vote. At least this guy voiced his opinion and voted whether I agree with it or not. What a bunch of cowards to not even show up to do your job."

Look at this way....they fuck up now. 2016 will be shit storm for Texas politicians. You don't listen to the majority watch what happens.
