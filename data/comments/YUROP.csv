Spam filter options apperantly needs fixing. Automod should really be an inherent function on the site, and not another third party tool.   This is all just things I've heard mods complain about. And that's not even considering the absolutely terrible communication from the admins (what is brigading? Is it ""Anything admins don't like"", because there's no actual rules around it, and some subreddits can break the unspoken rules but some can't). One of the mods of /r/India has been trying to find out why Times of India is spamfiltered by reddit, but he can't get an answer from the admins.   The whole Victoria thing really just caused it to blow up, since she was the main point between all the subreddits and the people doing AMAs, and then they fired her (for good reason or not, we don't know), didn't tell the mods (who had to be told BY THE AGENT OF THE GUY DOING THE AMA that she wouldn't be helping), then when the mods shut down their subreddits because it was literally impossible for them to do what they needed to do, then you have the Co-Founder of reddit blaming them and saying ""popcorn tastes good"".

In any case, when I say ""popular"" I don't mean that they're necessarily a part of mainstream fashion. They are, however, very popular with a subset of people.

That way people can feel safer with them and let them know if something is going wrong.  The US police just seem to want to put fear in the public.

(In case you went cross-eyed for a second, that’s just north of two billion games.) Unfortunately for our beleaguered spectator, that number also happens to be the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.  In other words, during the design of the spectator feature, our developers never anticipated the Game ID counter going that high on a single platform. EUW happens to be Riot’s largest shard globally - if one were posting this article in Twitch chat, the abbreviation might be “EUW > NA” - and surpassing that 231 digit threshold shot the lights out in EUW’s spectator mode."

YUROP,38wb59,DrVitoti,3,Sun Jun 7 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"La Défense:       La Défense (pronounced [la de.fɑ̃s]) is a major business district of the Paris Metropolitan Area and of the Île-de-France region, located in the commune of Courbevoie, and parts of Puteaux and Nanterre, just west of the city of Paris.  La Défense is Europe's largest purpose-built business district with 560 hectares (5.6 million square metres) area, 72 glass and steel buildings and skyscrapers, 180,000 daily workers, and 3.5 million square metres (37.7 million sq ft) of office space.  Around its Grande Arche and esplanade (""le Parvis""), La Défense contains many of the Paris urban area's tallest high-rises.  The district is located at the westernmost extremity of the ten-kilometre-long Historical Axis of Paris, which starts at the Louvre in Central Paris, and continues along the Champs-Élysées, well beyond the Arc de Triomphe along the Avenue de la Grande Armée before culminating at La Défense. The district is centred in an orbital motorway straddling the Hauts-de-Seine département municipalities of Courbevoie, Nanterre and Puteaux. La Défense is primarily a business district, and hosts only a population of 25,000 permanent residents and 45,000 students.   La Défense is also visited by 8,000,000 tourists each year,  and houses an open-air museum.

All roads were considered to begin from this monument and all distances in the Roman Empire were measured relative to that point.  On it were perhaps listed all the major cities in the empire and distances to them.  According to Schaaf,  the phrase ""all roads lead to Rome""  is a reference to the Milliarium Aureum, as the specific point to which all roads were said to lead. Today, the base of the milestone might still exist in the Roman Forum.

YUROP,35gse3,untouchedURL,3,Sun May 10 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Section 4. European Union of article  Potential superpowers:       The European Union (EU) has been called an emerging superpower by academics.   Many scholars and academics like T. R. Reid,  Andrew Reding,  Andrew Moravcsik,  Mark Leonard,  Jeremy Rifkin,  John McCormick,  and some politicians like Romano Prodi  and Tony Blair,  either believe that the EU is, or will become, a superpower in the 21st century.  Mark Leonard cites several factors: the EU's large population, large economy (the EU has the largest economy in the world), low inflation rates, the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent years, and certain EU member states' high quality of life (especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week, health care, social services).   John McCormick believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the Cold War-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening hard power of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union.

Personally I don't think this is the same as the Scottish referendum in that the loudest people are the anti-EU people but they are slowly becoming less popular the more they talk and the more people educate themselves. In Scotland the loudest people were the nationalists who became more popular as time went on. UKIP's leader is gone now and they did fairly poorly in the general election (though not any fault of their own) but their momentum is stalling.

This is namely due to the fact that UKIP is the furthest right party to exist, and it will continue to attract these types (whether you like it or not) until a new far right party is created.

YUROP,33jctw,IAmAGermanShepherd,12,Thu Apr 23 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"She was born in the village of Tállya in Hungary (the geographical midpoint of Europe) while her parents were vacationing there. Nobody knows where her family was from initially, it's only known that they were of mixed European ancestry. Her parents were teachers and liked to travel, so the family moved all over Europe during her childhood, thus exposing her to all the beautifully diverse cultures of the continent while of course learning all the individual languages, since she went to school (for free) in all of these countries.   She rode her bike without a helmet when she was young and survived without a scratch, and started drinking alcohol (but no hard liquor) in her mid teens so by the time she got her driver's licence she knew it was a bad idea to drink and drive. Unfortunately her sister was quite a bit different. Although the two were very close when they were kids, it all changed when they were in high school and her sister moved to the USA to study. There she got her driver's licence at 16 and after graduating from high school she went to med school on a scholarship. When she was 21 she started drinking alcohol as per the American rules, and believing the 5 years driving experience would make up for it she got behind the wheel drunk and crashed her car into a lamp post. She lay in a coma for 6 months and when she woke up she was rather changed. For some reason her brain had completely forgotten how the metric system works, light was hurting her eyes so she always had to wear sunglasses, and she absolutely could not comprehend how roundabouts or manual transmission in an automobile work anymore. She had become everything Europa was not, having crazy thoughts about how she will charge her patients an arm and a leg for her services once she graduates from med school, thus rendering the hippocratic oath completely moot. She eventually put on 120kg and became one of Europa's nemesis, Miss Murica.   You guys can continue, maybe we can put a story together using everybody's input."

YUROP,33e2m8,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:24:36 2015 UTC,"Suomenlinna:       Suomenlinna, until 1918 Viapori (Finnish), or Sveaborg (Swedish), is an inhabited sea fortress built on six islands (Kustaanmiekka, Susisaari, Iso-Mustasaari, Pikku-Mustasaari, Länsi-Mustasaari and Långören) and which now forms part of the city of Helsinki, the capital of Finland.  Suomenlinna is a UNESCO World Heritage site and popular with tourists and locals, who enjoy it as a picturesque picnic site. Originally named Sveaborg (Fortress of Svea), or Viapori as called by Finnish-speaking Finns, it was renamed Suomenlinna (Castle of Finland) in 1918 for patriotic and nationalistic reasons, though it is sometimes known by its original name.  The Swedish crown commenced the construction of the fortress in 1748 as protection against Russian expansionism. The general responsibility for the fortification work was given to Augustin Ehrensvärd. The original plan of the bastion fortress was strongly influenced by the ideas of Vauban, the foremost military engineer of the time, and the principles of Star Fort style of fortification, albeit adapted to a group of rocky islands.

YUROP,30tabc,Screaming_Eagle,3,Tue Mar 31 09:54:57 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of an awkward one, because you could argue that forcibly banning geographical restriction & borging smaller markets into one mega-market  arguably runs counter to the EU's tenet of free flow of goods and trade. Smaller markets which are solid, reliable sources of income for smaller content creators - or niche markets for certain market sectors - could struggle to maintain existing business models.   The legal cost of being forced to revisit every single territory-specific contract and licence for just the music industry would be prohibitively expensive and would inevitably end with prices increasing, and most likely the net return to rightsholders (namely artists and recipients of performance and writers royalties) decreasing due to these costs. It's a pessimistic look, but to foist a singular pan-continent licensing structure onto an incredibly intricate industry in one fell swoop will cause so many problems.   I say this as an escapee of the independent music sector, I know how complex it is! The majors are even more impenetrably complicated. It's just as tricky for broadcasters wherever 'content' is involved; contracts - already sophisticated and covering an explicit set of rights for their small range of broadcast territories - will have to be revisited and probably renegotiated, adding years to the work, taking years of people's lives and adding reams to contracts!  Then again, it could all work out great. Hope springs eternal. And I am a Europhile!"

The music stopped playing and you have to realize that if you want nice things (extensive welfare, early retirement, free schools, etc.) you need the money to pay for it. You don't have any. You're living hand to mouth as country all the while begging for more wherever you can just to pay for the bare essentials. And then when we ask you to work a few more years like the rest of us you go out in the streets and start rioting. How can anyone think 53 as a retirement age is something feasible?

Perhaps not a perfect comparison, but the British Royal Navy - the strongest at the beginning of WW2 and reigning supreme - was embarassed when it kept losing to a small, ""young"" and both outmanned and outgunned German fleet.   In addition, recent skirmishes between (semi-)modern armies such as in the Falklands, Yugoslavia and now Ukraine have shown that technologic superiority doesn't always win battles, nor do you need to use guerilla tactics or civilian warfare."

In the mid-2000s, the Navy was finally rattled enough to start a Diesel-Electric Submarine Initiative (DESI) with allied navies, such as those of Peru, Columbia, Chile and Brazil, to train in anti-submarine warfare. It even leased for two years—complete with crew—a modern Swedish Gotland-class submarine to participate in U.S. Navy exercises.  The Swedish sub and crew promptly demonstrated their proficiency by “sinking” a Nimitz-class carrier, among other ships and submarines.  The lease appears not to have been renewed, even though the Navy continued to have extreme difficulty in finding the Swedish sub at sea.   It's a pity that US citizens have to spend all that money on their military then have to hire glorious Yuropeans to do the job for them.

YUROP,2y44tn,TheNecromancer,8,Fri Mar 6 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"not ""lightly"" at all. It's just that you can't armor yourself against a modern warhead.   Even if you can slap enough metal on all sides, getting a warhead to detonate on the surface will damage a lot of materiel and sensors, likely taking the flight deck out of service  for some time.   Ballistic missiles leave little time for intercept - and target guidance in the final stage of trajectory - necessary with conventional payload - is said to have siginficantly improved.   Another approach is a ""swarm"" of missiles, coming in low to evade detection, rise near the ship and try to hit it from above where armor is usually weakest;  coordinating and retargeting to take out ships in order of priority.   (FWIW, I am by no means an expert in that matter)"

YUROP,2y0z39,shameless_inc,3,Sun Mar 29 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Well German can be used in a very powerful way, more so than related languages like Dutch and Danish, all of which in turn have that more than Latin languages.    It's really easy because German has words that are short, easy to pronounce and easy to understand. E.g. ""ACHTUNG!"" is way more powerful than ""WARNING!"".     Personally, I think there's a difference between how women and how men pronounce their every-day dialects. I may be biased because I'm used to Germans from the Ruhrgebiet, but overall women tend to speak both more clearly and more softly."
YUROP,2y0z39,sabasNL,2,Sun Mar 29 16:13:02 2015 UTC,I'd say this is pretty much spot on. I'm living in the Ruhrgebiet as well (I moved here about three years ago) and people here tend to use variations of words that have even more consonants than the German language already has (which is what I think makes it sound so powerful).  The people from the Ruhrgebiet are a really good example for variations in the sound of this language.

Although there were emperors of Japan before the Meiji Restoration, the restoration established the practical abilities and consolidated the political system under the Emperor of Japan. The goals of the restored government were expressed by the new emperor in the Charter Oath. The Restoration led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure, and spanned both the late Edo period (often called Late Tokugawa shogunate) and the beginning of the Meiji period. The period spanned from 1868 to 1912 and was responsible for the emergence of Japan as a modernized nation in the early twentieth century.

I mean they're still not entirely sure about evolution vs creationism, abortion, public health insurance and homosexuality; like we were once too. They're just lagging behind half a century. Give them some time, they'll figure it out by themselves."
YUROP,2v8jeo,tetroxid,6,Mon Feb 9 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, except for the homosexuality thing. 3/4 of the US population now lives in states where gay marriage is legal, the battle is now taking place in Alabama (of all places!) and the Supreme Court has, I believe, agreed to review a same-sex marriage case, which could possibly mean that it becomes legal in the whole country! Meanwhile in oh-so-progressive Europe, I am ashamed that even Germany and Austria, homeland of Conchita Wurst, do not have it. Italy, Greece and the whole of Eastern Europe: nothing, nada. A shame, really."
YUROP,2v8jeo,Highollow,6,Mon Feb 9 12:48:11 2015 UTC,Why do you equal lack of gay marriage rights to homophobic intolerance? They're completely different issues.
YUROP,2v8jeo,Heshvoby,2,Mon Feb 9 18:07:57 2015 UTC,You're right. But they're not totally unrelated huh? ;)
YUROP,2v8jeo,Highollow,3,Mon Feb 9 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"They are. In Polish language 'marriage' definition is związek kobiety i mężczyzny usankcjonowany prawnie which translates to the legitimized by law union of a woman and a man. Thus as you can see the gay 'marriage' is not possible by definition. There are various projects to replace the word 'marriage' in legislation with 'union' to solve this issue. (On the sidenote: every change in Polish dictionary must be approved by Polish Language Council)  Edit: deleted not so funny sarcastic statement, sorry."
YUROP,2v8jeo,Heshvoby,3,Mon Feb 9 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"They are not. But well, I'm not going to argue that you can be against same-sex marriage yet tolerant, you can. But there is a correlation.  But your arguments don't stand. Are you saying that same-sex marriage can only be possible if the Polish Language Council gives its consent?    Also in Eastern Europe being gay won't get you in trouble, being a faggot sometimes will :)   Patently false and not funny, unless my sarcasm-detector is broken here."
YUROP,2v8jeo,Highollow,2,Mon Feb 9 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"It's just a legal issue. The laws define marriage as the union between a man and a woman, just as Polish dictionaries do. This obviously is for historic reasons. Now if the very definition of the word marriage in Polish excludes same sex marriages then either the word marriage needs to be substituted with something less narrow (like union, partnership, whatever) or the definition of the word marriage needs to be changed. By law, for the definition of a Polish word to be changed said council must agree."
YUROP,2v8jeo,tetroxid,0,Sat Feb 21 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, but would you then find it acceptable that a council of some sorts has the last word in such discussions? What if a law legalizing Same-sex marriage is passed, but the council doesn't agree? What if the council suddenly decided to change the definition of marriage to, I don't know, ""50 cl of milk"", would there be no marriages according to the Polish government anymore? I don't believe that a ""language council"" has anything to say in such a debate."
YUROP,2v8jeo,Highollow,2,Sat Feb 21 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"It does not, as I said, they could just change the laws on marriage to use the word union. They could also redefine ""marriage"" in the laws which obviously overrules any dictionary, but that is not the case at the moment.  Either:    The laws must be changed The definition of marriage must be changed"

YUROP,2uw285,kartoffel_man,3,Sun Feb 8 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Section 17. Marian interpretation of article  Flag of Europe:       The flag bears resemblance to the twelve-star halo of the Virgin Mary, as described in the Apocalypse, also known as the Book of Revelation, the final book of the New Testment.  A great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.  Official authorities of the European Union disregard the biblical interpretation as myth.  The flag's designer, Arsène Heitz, has however acknowledged that this was a source of inspiration.  Furthermore, on 21 October 1956 the Council of Europe presented the city of Strasbourg, its official seat, with a stained glass window for Strasbourg Cathedral by the Parisian master Max Ingrand. It shows a blessing Madonna underneath a circle of 12 stars on dark blue ground.  The overall design of the Madonna is inspired by the banner of the cathedral's Congrégation Mariale des Hommes, and the twelve stars are found on the statue venerated by this congregation inside the cathedral (twelve is also the number of members of the congregation's council).

The song is the first example of the ""European march"" anthemic style.

The song was important to certain anti-Nazi resistance movements in Germany.[4] In 1942, Sophie Scholl, a member of the White Rose resistance group, played the song on her flute outside the walls of Ulm prison, where her father Robert had been detained for calling the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler a ""scourge of God"". Earlier, in 1935, the guards at the Lichtenburg concentration camp had ordered prisoners to stage a performance in celebration of Hitler's 46th birthday; the imprisoned Jewish lawyer Hans Litten recited ""Die Gedanken sind frei"" in response.[5]  Source: Wikipedia"

I am not sure a place with so much history together, with so much division in the past can truly unite. Certain parts would want to dominate it.  It worked in the US because these were new lands, many of them sharing a similar culture and language that came together and were able to spread. China united thousands of years ago and had often been a powerhouse on the world stage and is starting to become one again.  But a federal Europe, I am not sure it is achievable in our lifetime."

YUROP,2r76cc,tony_bruguier,1 point,Tue Jan 6 06:02:23 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Primary deficit, total deficit, and debt of article  Government budget balance:       The meaning of ""deficit"" differs from that of ""debt"", which is an accumulation of yearly deficits. Deficits occur when a government's expenditures exceed the revenue that it generates. The deficit can be measured with or without including the interest payments on the debt as expenditures.   The primary deficit is defined as the difference between current government spending on goods and services and total current revenue from all types of taxes net of transfer payments. The total deficit (which is often called the fiscal deficit or just the 'deficit') is the primary deficit plus interest payments on the debt.   Therefore, if  is a timeframe,  is government spending and  is tax revenue for the respective timeframe, then     Interesting: Puerto Rico government budget balance | Financial institution | Twin deficits hypothesis | Divestment   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

YUROP,2po4rg,malnutrition6,10,Thu Dec 18 12:58:02 2014 UTC,"This infographic is about public Wi-Fi. That has nothing to do with the average (ethernet) Internet speed; the Netherlands is still #1 at that.    One reason why we're not seeing the Netherlands in this list might be because mobile data (3G, 4G) is very well-developed in the Netherlands; on average once again the best. Select spots in Sweden and Germany supposedly do have higher speeds, but the difference with these two countries is that the Netherlands has reliable national coverage, on average high speeds, almost full 4G coverage, and high reliablity.    Public Wi-Fi isn't used often in the Netherlands except for some public buildings and events; one reason for this is that public Wi-Fi is very vulnerable to security breaches, which has been pointed out by Dutch students last year.      The main competition comes form eastern Asia, mainly Singapore and South-Korea. Both are investing a lot in their respective Internet infrastructure. Currently the EU and the South-Korean government are doing a competition who's getting to 5G first.    Ofcourse, everyone knows GLORIOUS YUROP will win the Internet Race."

Jeremy Clarkson: Europeans are better (on Top Gear). The source article for this image. Quote:    This came off the back of an opinion piece in the Sunday Times which sang the praises of the European project, with Clarkson going as far as to state that: ""I long for a time when I think of myself as a European first and an Englishman second. I crave a United States of Europe with one currency, one army and one type of plug.""     Jeremy Clarkson: We’ll always have Paris and Polish dumplings — until UKIP wins the day . This is the opinion piece referred to above. It's behind a paywall, but this redditor on /r/europe pasted the whole thing. Quote:    I love Europe and it makes me happy that one day we will have forgotten the difficult birth and made the EU work. I long for a time when I think of myself as a European first and an Englishman second. I crave a United States of Europe with one currency, one army and one type of plug socket. And yes, I know, there will be drawbacks. We’re already seeing some of them, which is why more than a quarter of those who went to the polls in the recent European elections voted UKIP.  One of the drawbacks I notice quite often is that in South Kensington, which is a leafy part of southwest London, almost everyone is French. The whole area is awash with lovely patisseries and the pavements are rammed with women so elegant and beautiful I have to bite the back of my hand to stop myself from crying out. This is obviously so much worse than if everyone were lurching around in tracksuits looking for somewhere to vomit.  Just up the road, I know of a Polish restaurant where you can buy dainty little dumplings. And for sure this is a huge step backwards from the takeaway joint that used to be on the site. Because who wants to be served a dumpling by a charming Polish man when they could have a polystyrene tray full of slime instead?  My local off-licence is staffed entirely by French people who know everything about wine. And that’s wrong too. Because what you actually want is a fat school-leaver and a shop full of Carling Black Label.   If I may comment, the opinion piece shows that he is massively pro-European but also recognizes issues with the EU as it is now. Nevertheless, he does express quite strongly that he is an idealist and a federalist.   Jeremy Clarkson: ""It has been a difficult year"". Quote:    “I’m massively pro-European so it becomes rather difficult to support a party that wants primarily to get you out of Europe. Anyway there doesn’t seem to be a party for UKIP there’s just one man in a Barbour with a pint and a fag.”"

According to Marxism, nationalism is only a tool of the ruling class, used to keep the working class divided and thus easier to control and exploit. With the success of class struggle (i.e. the abolition of social classes), the natural brotherhood of all workers would make the idea of separate nations obsolete. The concept of the fraternity of the peoples is often opposed to ""bourgeois cosmopolitanism"".

This way, yes, you have more disposable income. But are you really richer because of it? I seriously doubt it. In my country we like to measure our wealth on the poorest, not on the richest. I'm sure now all of your commie detector alarms are going off, but you know what? Europe is socialist. Deal with it.  Edit: I don't know how to English"

In fact, according to the linked chart, in the cases of countries including Russia, Portugal, and Turkey, the US's bottom 10% is actually better off than those countries' top 10%! The typical person in the bottom five percent in the US is richer than 68% of the people in the world!  Yes, the US has the largest separation between rich and poor in the world, and the graph I linked confirms that (along with this one), but as both graphs show, it's moreso because the US population is that rich than anything else."

Hardly ""500 years of colonising and genocide"".   denmark/norway   Largely uninhabited wastes and few trading areas and towns, some of them working under the local laws, not under Danish navy.   Sorry, but the Norse taught England everything they know about colonizing and enslaving.   I'm not sure if that applies. The era of colonisation is said to have started with Columbus. Anything before that is just fighting between equals.   Anyway, the idea of state back then was ""area paying tithe"". The ""colonised area"" was pretty much everything outside the village where the the throne was kept.   Ireland..go to any city in the US on St. Patrick's day.   You may have heard of the potato famine and the exodus it caused. Not the work of the government.   Luxembourg was part of France and Germany at the times they were doing lots of colonizing.   Well, I grant you the French, but Luxembourg was part of the Holy Roman Empire and iirc they didn't have colonies of any sort.   The Swiss didn't do anything, though plenty of them profited through other nations' colonies.    That argument is awfully slippery. If ""profiting"" from trade makes one guilty, then there is no possible way of ever handling blame to anybody."

They just don't know it yet.   Also, your attribution of European prosperity to be solely, or even just significantly, the result of colonization displays a hilariously piss-poor'Murican education-level grasp of historical economics."

Or how you can have christian rock, hell even metal?   Music shouldn't be defined by its scene- gangsta rap isn't necessarily limited to just gangstas and ""niggers from the hood"", just like electronic music doesn't have to be defined by loose and probably unhealthy use of party drugs or coke or whatever is the flavour of the month/place. Though electronic music is mainstream nowadays and people like Deadmau5 show you can be anti-drugs and still popular because its big enough for it.  Once a tiny genre becomes a huge thing the scene is even less relevant and it becomes more of a question of subcultures and sub-genres like metal subgenres."
YUROP,2mamso,ArvinaDystopia,2,Mon Nov 17 01:38:36 2014 UTC,I'd never heard of straight edge or christian rock/metal until I came to the US. I think your perception of 'most popular' is very Ameri-centric. I understand that Murican culture is still stuck in the time of Prohibition and Bible morals but in Yurop that's definitely not the case.  I just out of curiosity googled 'top straight edge bands' and I don't know any of them. I believe you are definitely overestimating how this subgenre is ' one of the most popular and widespread'. Maybe in Murican Bible belt high schools but not really beyond that.

Take in some Progress Humanitate et Space, and European technical supremacy over the next 24, and marvel as history of the conquest and expansion to space is being made live, in front of our eyes.  Thanks Internet!  [First Update]  You can learn a bit more about Comet Rosetta here, which we're joyously riding, and while the craft has touched down 3 hours ago, it is designed to remain for ~64 hours, with intent of doing as much science as it may!  Quite a leap, this, over a century from conclusion of WWI. Sigh. Think if we actually managed to convince the broadly meant commonwealth to realise the scope and importance of our development and take serious funding to Space. Gods, with how little do we truly know of our this existence, its properties and governing laws...  I'm telling you. We would've been an interstellar species/empire had Rome never went lame and fallen.  [Second Update]  Listen, it might be all a static transmission from the Command Centre which in its dynamism and tempo rivals Somme, but we've just advanced to smooth jazz covers of AC/DC, and as such have the legit privilege of being the first Humans in history to watch command of a cosmic mission play out to a tune this funky.

YUROP,2lmajp,Greyfells,17,Sat Nov 8 00:33:16 2014 UTC,"Again? You want an unbiased opinion from pro-EU circlejerk? Let me tell the essentials of my post, when you asked this in /r/Europe  Is it stable?   With the intertwining of economies it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, for the EU to stop existing. The cost of going back to national focused economies is too great for any politician to face. Even countries whoo are thinking off leaving the EU don't want to leave behind the benefits of the single markter, hence they would remain in the European Economic Area and therefore under EU-control. following-up point: something called path-dependency. It is politcially easier to fix a problem than go back on certain decisions in the past (if you know about the Belgian democratic structure...we know all about it)   Are internal relationships going strong?   with intertwining economies and a mentality that war is bad, it is next to impossible that EU-member states will attack eacht other. They can and will argue over a lot of things, but things are highly unlikely to get so bad that we will ever have war amongst ourselves. That's strong enough for me.   Is every member fully commited?   No, ofcourse not. Some more than others. Everyone wants a piece of the pie without paying for it. Still, certainly the little nations among us, realise the mean nothing on the world stage anymore if they're not cooperating.    Some things are just easier done cooperating. Nobody's gonna give a damn if Belgium or Denmark is gonna impose economic sanctions! But if the whole EU-market blocks you out...  The cooperation aspect lowers costs of certain actions and gives us some international weight (f.e. the buying of military equipement => if the EU bargains as a bloc, they are much stronger then when they bargain seperatly). That fact alone is what i think will continue European integration.  the bad stuff:   Clumsy organisation: Leaders of member states (especially France and Germany) want to have a last say, which limits democracy and complicates working on EU-level. Austerity didn't work. If the EU can't bring the prosperity it has delivered until so far, it loses status amongst its citizens. Failing foreign policy: because of member-states squabiling with eachother, the EU-foreign policy is ridiculously weak and ineffective."

Overall, despite that economic tension (Austerity tension?) relations are usually good.  Majority of members are committed to the existence of the Union, there are European countries awaiting to join (not Turkey, they are not European), the hot topic I guess it's the Euro since countries like Poland doesn't want to use it because it's shit, I mean, it's a good idea but it turned into shit.  As for me as an European Union citizen I'm pretty happy with what the EU does specially their rules for the protections of consumers, I'd like a more (direct) democratic union but we will get there someday.

The viaduct is 1,065 metres (3,494 ft) long and is mounted on 11 Y-shaped columns (its distinguishing feature), the highest reaching 87.5 m (287 ft).  The viaduct was designed by Janez Koželj and Marjan Pippenbaher, who was also its constructor.  The construction work began in 2001 and the viaduct was opened for traffic on 23 September 2004.

If we're keeping to the West, even Germany alone has more refugees (571,685) than the U.S.  ""Oh but Europe has a larger population!""  Alright, so let's count refugees per capita.  Spain, Italy, Finland, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Cyprus, Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Germany, Sweden and Norway and Switzerland have more refugees per capita than the US.  If we count the whole world, 77 nations take more refugees per capita than the US, and 10 nations take more refugees in absolute numbers than the US.  The EU have 1,339,239 confirmed refugees, or ~26 refugees/10,000 natives. The US have 264,763 confirmed refugees, or ~8 refugees/10,000 natives.  And talking about foreign aid: 19 countries pay more of their GDP to foreign aid than the US, 15 of which are European and 12 of which are in the EU.  Seriously, I like the US.

Something like this wouldn't work for rehabilitating criminals in my professional opinion.  Hate to break it to you, pal:  ""The national recidivism rate in the United States is 67.5 percent according to information from the Bureau of Justice Statistics""  ""Sweden's national recidivism rate is 35 percent ""  ""Norway has the lowest overall reoffending rate among correctional clients in the Nordic countries, 20 %.""  Seems like these ""cushy, hotel prisons"" are giving your American concentration camp prisons a bit of an ass-kicking."
YUROP,2le92j,savois-faire,3,Thu Nov 6 09:54:27 2014 UTC,"Really interesting video, didn't know Sweden had prisons like that.  The prison system here in the USA is so messed up.  I don't think Sweden's exact approach would work here though.  Too many inmates, no money.  And are there many hardened criminals in Sweden?  In US prisons there's tons of gang affiliations, murderers in for life willing to kill because they have nothing to lose.  Fights, riots, inmates throwing feces and urine at guards, setting fires.  Try to shoot feces coated darts at guards.  Sneaking drugs in through their body cavities.  Source: correction officer friends.  I would never be able to handle a job like that.  http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=iU7ZA7yB0kQ  http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=EvtPim-Gync"
YUROP,2le92j,schiddy,12,Fri Nov 7 11:05:54 2014 UTC,"I would say your main problem is that in the US, prison is big business. They're quite happy to keep incarcerating at absolutely insane rates (no country in the world incarcerates more of its citizens than the land of the free, half a million more than China, which has a population five times greater than the U.S.) because that's exactly how the prison system makes its billions. Through privatizing the prisons, you've made a self-sustaining billion dollar industry out of exploiting prisoners.   It is actually illegal to bring anything into the US that's manufactured by ""slave labor or prisoners"", but in the US, prisoners - through what is essentially forced unpaid labor - make for example 100% of all domestically produced military helmets, belts, ammunition, bulletproof vests, ID tags etc., 93% of all domestically produced paint, 36% of home appliances, 25% of office furnitures, which is how you manage to compete with the exporting factories in Mexico which can produce these things so cheaply by underpaying their workers, because you make it even more cheaply by having prisoners make them for no pay at all. In a way one could say you've re-invented slavery through the prison system.   The privatization of prisons, leading to the setting up of lobbies who promise donations to politicians in exchange for a promise to keep ""getting tougher on crime"" (i.e. ""keep bringing in the free workers to make stuff for us to sell""). Even though crimerates in the US have dropped every single year for many years now, the prison population gets bigger every year.  To quote an article from Global Research:  ""The private contracting of prisoners for work fosters incentives to lock people up. Prisons depend on this income. Corporate stockholders who make money off prisoners’ work lobby for longer sentences, in order to expand their workforce. The system feeds itself,” says a study by the Progressive Labor Party""  ""The prison industry complex is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States and its investors are on Wall Street. “This multimillion-dollar industry has its own trade exhibitions, conventions, websites, and mail-order/Internet catalogs. It also has direct advertising campaigns, architecture companies, construction companies, investment houses on Wall Street, plumbing supply companies, food supply companies, armed security, and padded cells in a large variety of colors."" All made possible by unpaid ""workers"" i.e. prisoners.  EDIT: added a link to the article, it's a very interesting read."
YUROP,2le92j,savois-faire,4,Fri Nov 7 11:39:56 2014 UTC,"I feel that the point James touched at the end is very relevant. He says that the Nordic prison model is fine as long as you have an unlimited model. The reason why Nordic prisons are so well equipped compared to the tougher prisons in America is that, as we saw in the beginning, there are relatively about 10x more prisoners in America to take care of. Due to this huge budget that opens up if you only had 10% of the prisoners they have now in America, I think they could aspire to adjust to the Nordic model, which clearly have a higher success rate."
YUROP,2le92j,Breamer333,14,Thu Nov 6 10:17:18 2014 UTC,"True. But that's an inherent flaw of the US system. They focus on punishment and not on resocialization and thus have on the long run more criminals. Also other factors come into play (no or inadequate welfare; absurd punishment of illegal substance abuse etc.) that causes - more or less - normal people to be thrown into prison, where they are likely to get out after their sentence with even more criminal energy than before.  Add to that for-profit prisons and it is no wonder that the US is leading the statistics when it comes to inmates per capita."
YUROP,2le92j,Restrider,2,Thu Nov 6 10:31:31 2014 UTC,I agree completely.
YUROP,2le92j,Breamer333,8,Thu Nov 6 10:56:22 2014 UTC,there are relatively about 10x more prisoners in America to take care of   Worth mentioning that Finland had more prisoners per capita than USA in the 50s before we transitioned to the Nordic model (from something close to the current US model).
YUROP,2le92j,OWKuusinen,0,Thu Nov 6 12:49:16 2014 UTC,"Thats just a ridiculous excuse. You may have 10x more prisoners, but you have 50x the population of Norway and that means 50x the tax expenditure Norway has."

YUROP,2k7v5n,daveboy2000,2,Wed Oct 29 22:22:25 2014 UTC,"Section 1. Normal development of article  Phimosis:       At birth, the inner layer of the foreskin is sealed to the glans penis. This attachment forms ""early in fetal development and provide[s] a protective cocoon for the delicate developing glans.""  The foreskin is usually non-retractable in infancy and early childhood.   Medical associations advise not to retract the foreskin of an infant, in order to prevent scarring.   Some argue that non-retractability may ""be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.""   Hill states that full retractability of the foreskin may not be achieved until late childhood or early adulthood.  A Danish survey found that the mean age of first foreskin retraction is 10.4 years.   Rickwood, as well as other authors, has suggested that true phimosis is over-diagnosed due to failure to distinguish between normal developmental non-retractability and a pathological condition.    Some authors use the terms ""physiologic"" and ""pathologic"" to distinguish between these types of phimosis;  others use the term ""non-retractile foreskin"" to distinguish this developmental condition from pathologic phimosis.

Also, I would speculate it was pushed by people who were generally reactionary against the sexual revolution of the previous decades, and liked the idea of sex feeling less good for all men.   But it so turns out receptive anal intercourse is actually 3450% more of a risk than insertive penile-vaginal intercourse. Oops."

YUROP,2jmxtt,PlayMp1,7,Sun Oct 19 14:00:01 2014 UTC,"Scandinavia as a cultural concept refers to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, who have shared culture and history, and to an extent, language (all of the languages are mutually intelligible to each other, and they're one of the most well known examples of the blurry line between dialect and language).  Finland speaks a completely and utterly different language that's not even Indo-European, it's Finno-Ugric (i.e., more similar to people from the Urals than it is to Scandinavia). Finland is sometimes included and sometimes excluded from Scandinavia because it has a somewhat similar culture (it was part of Sweden for centuries), but the language is utterly different. It's also partially on the actual geographic feature of Scandinavia - the penis-shaped peninsula hanging over Germany - but it's also not really on the peninsula.  Fennoscandinavia is sometimes what's used instead to clarify that entire area instead of just Scandinavia."

My uncle has no degree but now works for Boeing in Seattle, i think Britain has a treaty with America, Canada and Australia where both countries citizens are ""fast tracked"" to get a visa.  We wont be leaving the EU soon, im pretty sure Labour will win next election and they are pro-EU (just want reform).  For me i love the UK and Europe as a whole, i wish we where as integrated into the EU as Germany is (except keeping the pound). The UK could be leading from the front instead of detracting from the back. Such a shame."
YUROP,2i15ek,LimitlessLTD,7,Thu Oct 2 09:05:15 2014 UTC,"The things i love about the UK:   Historically a leader in human rights, democracy and freedoms of expression Its history and the connections that we as a nation have forged throughout the world. A country of 60 million people is still the 6th largest economy on the planet. The first Nation too use its navy and actively seek out and punish slavers. has legally upheld the rights of ""the freeman"" since the 13th century. (magna carta) Our commitment to continental and international stability and security as well as the enourmos amount of aid we give to other not so well off countries.   I am well aware of the various shit things that Britain has done, but imo the good things that Britain has done far outweigh the bad. The same goes for the rest of Europe really, it has been the centre of human enlightenment and progression since the renaissance and even before with the Roman empire and greek states.  European history has dictated that nations have an obligation to take care of their citizens, by providing nationalised health care and state benefits. Europe in general does not see things in black and white like America does. By that i mean any sort of socialism is automatically equated to communism due to cold war era propaganda.  We as a continent have been fighting each other for a very long time, and only now; after two world wars and near complete annihilation have we emerged as a centre of stability, human progression.  Maybe i just like history but IMO Europe has done a hell of a lot for this planet and the good of the human race."

YUROP,2hiwnr,JohnCent,6,Fri Sep 26 17:53:41 2014 UTC,It gives an unfair advantage to people who speak those languages natively to get jobs in the institutions
YUROP,2hiwnr,gragazzo,2,Fri Sep 26 17:56:25 2014 UTC,"Except, in reality you have to speak several European languages to work for the EU, resulting in considerably fewer native English speakers working there. Many people consider being born into an English-speaking country as a blessing with regard to language, but it really isn't. It's easy to learn English, it's much harder the other way around – and when you only speak one language, you're missing out on a lot of things."
YUROP,2hiwnr,boq,1 point,Fri Sep 26 19:16:44 2014 UTC,"It's easy to learn English   I've always heard it the other way around. That, as a language, English is difficult, because grammar/tense/spelling/pronunciation rules exist in larger numbers and with a larger number of exceptions than most other languages.  However, I agree that, as a native English speaker, it's difficult for me to learn other languages. Mainly because everyone speaks English. Even when I got across a border and attempt to communicate in a country's language, I get responded to in English. It makes a serious attempt at learning new languages seem pretty moot."
YUROP,2hiwnr,Le_Meow_Meow,2,Sat Sep 27 04:47:33 2014 UTC,"So the most fair thing it to use the language the most people speak, and teach it everywhere."

YUROP,2hiwnr,Le_Meow_Meow,4,Fri Sep 26 18:19:50 2014 UTC,"I don't know if native speakers will always be better.  I literally cannot tell that most Euro redditors are not native speakers.  Maybe they would have an accent in IRL, but they obviously are very proficient."

YUROP,2hiwnr,Flaczki,3,Fri Sep 26 19:02:33 2014 UTC,"Interesting.   My point thought was that English is a tool of globalization, forced on us by the Internet."
YUROP,2hiwnr,Gfourtwolon,4,Fri Sep 26 19:05:39 2014 UTC,"Granted, they only spoke it because they tried to sell shit to everyone (it worked).  And in my case (Dutch), it's something that has always been there, internet or not."
YUROP,2hiwnr,Le_Meow_Meow,2,Fri Sep 26 19:09:42 2014 UTC,"You guys are basically native speakers.  Besides a slight accent, Dutch and the Nordics largely do speak and write at the same level as someone from the Anglosphere."
YUROP,2hiwnr,Le_Meow_Meow,2,Fri Sep 26 19:48:01 2014 UTC,"OK, but the fact the everyone uses English here, or /r/europe should make it clear that it is quite useful to speak English, and people are not going to want to learn a synthetic language."

YUROP,2etjip,Espenx1,4,Mon Sep 1 16:42:58 2014 UTC,"Norwegian here. Yes we have mandatory service in a special way. There are two tests you have to take first 'Sesjon 1 & 2' which basically determines if you're even good enough to join the military.    'Sesjon 1' goes in on personal information, if you have any medical history, mental problems ect.    'Sesjon 2' goes in on the physical and mental capacity which you have, these grades rank from 1-9 (1 is the worst and 9 is the best)    There are 4 categories in which you have to pass: Medical examination Strength tests  (was unavailable on my day) Stamina tests (run on a treadmil, for each minute it increases with 1km/h, for max 15 min) and last, The mental tests which tests your math skills, use of words and word similarities (kinda like vulgar and tasteless)  After that you get to place a wish on what division you want to go to, if you have no wish you get randomly placed.    The mandatory service is 12 months, with an extended period of 6 months if you want to go into the home defense (Heimeværnet)    And yes, we go into the military after school at ages of 18-19 years."
YUROP,2etjip,tetroxid,1 point,Wed Sep 3 11:27:25 2014 UTC,"That's almost exactly the same as in Switzerland except that it is voluntary for women and mandatory for men. Also the service is just 22 weeks (Rekrutenschule, school for recruits), and after that 4 weeks per year of WK (Wiederholungskurs, repetition course) until fifty or so. If you want to become an officer or make the military your job it's considerably longer. If you don't do service for any reason you are billed 3% of your income.  That aside: the accomodations for these norwegian soldiers are like a hotel compared to ours. We were usually 20+ men in one room, we shared a big ass shower room with 200+ and did not have our own washing machines. Also if the outfits didn't match up upon inspection....

International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.  It is also normally understood to be a state that is neither dependent on nor subject to any other power or state.   The existence or disappearance of a state is a question of fact.  While according to the declarative theory of state recognition a sovereign state can exist without being recognised by other sovereign states, unrecognised states will often find it hard to exercise full treaty-making powers and engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states.

This shallow chart is highly misleading in that regard.      The figures from Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, also showed that during 2013, GDP contracted by 0.4% in the eurozone, but increased by 0.1% in the EU as a whole..   US economy grew 1.5% in 2013.. you can't even interpret basic statistics to draw conclusions hahaha  how about we list the number of top universities? the US has MUCH MORE that the entire CONTINENT of Europe.. that's pretty damn sad, but it explains your scientific and technological underachievement compared to the US. that also could explain why the US space budget is MUCH higher than ALL COMBINED SPACE PROGRAM BUDGETS OF THE ENTIRE EU. enjoy your brain drain, the US welcomes those Europeans who realize what a silly place your continent is.   not to mention the EU has thousands of years of development ahead of the US, it's pretty fucking sad you guys still have such mediocre numbers compared to such a young country that could wipe out your entire population in a heart beat.   if anything, this chart should make you ashamed to be European. don't forget that the US is the reason you're not speaking German or Russian and that it rebuilt your still struggling continent after WW2 because you're too incompetent to do it yourself. constantly talking shit about other people will never make you any less inferior."

YUROP,21ql9b,SirFloIII,5,Mon Apr 7 15:22:15 2014 UTC,"Renaissance fair:       A Renaissance fair, Renaissance faire, or Renaissance festival is an outdoor weekend gathering, usually held in the United States, open to the public and typically commercial in nature, which emulates a historic period for the amusement of its guests. Some are permanent theme parks, while others are short-term events in fairgrounds or other large public or private spaces.  Renaissance fairs generally include an abundance of costumed entertainers or fair-goers, musical and theatrical acts, art and handicrafts for sale, and festival food. Some offer campgrounds for those who wish to stay more than one day.  Many Renaissance fairs are set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Some are set earlier, during the reign of Henry VIII, or in other countries, such as France, and some are set outside the era of the Renaissance; these may include earlier Medieval periods (including Vikings), or later periods, such as 17th-18th Century pirates. Some engage in deliberate ""time travel"" by encouraging participants to wear costumes representing several eras in a broad time period. Renaissance fairs encourage visitors to enter into the spirit of things with costumes and audience participation. Many welcome fantasy elements such as wizards and elves.
