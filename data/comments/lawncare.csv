I use Milorganite and they recommend to fertilize on a holiday schedule as it's easy to remember.   ... or overseed and how frequently to do it?    Overseed in the fall when it starts to cool down.  I don't have a more specific date though.   When should I aerate?   If you have cool season grasses, aerate in the spring or fall.   I'll definitely get my soil checked. What should I do? How do I get a soil sample to bring in? Or would they give/sell me a kit?   Do a search for your state & extension service.  Their site should let you see if there is a local office near you.  This was a number of years ago for me, but I got a few paper cardboard boxes that I filled with dirt dug from a few inches down in the areas I wanted tested (planting beds were separate from the lawn, which if it was big enough, different areas got their own box too).  The box had check boxes to indicate where the sample came from, etc.  Then you send that in to be tested and they send back an analysis with nutrient, etc levels and recommendations on what to do.  However, this was quite awhile ago, so you should probably just call the number on the extension website and ask them, though they may also have a FAQ section.  They will tell you more specific instructions.   I recently bought a weed popper. The kind that are like four feet long that you jam into the ground and pop out a little hole. It's been neat. I'll be using that frequently.   I really want one of these!  :D"

lawncare,3dydf8,pjdonovan,3,Mon Jul 20 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but as far as I know, Bermuda prefers a lot more sunlight, where fescue does well in areas that don't get a lot of sun. Do you have a big tree that shades much of your lawn?   It also sounds like you may be cutting your Bermuda too low as people in this sub seem to recommend cutting as high as possible, to let the grass flourish enough to shade over weeds. Also, the shade from taller grass holds water in better and can collect more sunlight for photosynthesis.   Bermuda does really well with a lot of water too. I would recommend watering at least a couple times a week until it looks better."
lawncare,3dydf8,EXTREMELYLAME,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"1.25"" is NOT too low for Bermuda.  Even seeded Bermuda can be cut very low and actually thrives better at those heights.  It becomes thin and stringy at taller heights while it meshes and turns into actual turf when low.  Also, 1"" of water is about right for Bermuda to do well in the summer heat.  I'm inclined to agree with you on the shade issue though.  If Bermuda isn't doing well it's either too shaded or way overwatered."
lawncare,3dydf8,CBRich,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:41 2015 UTC,"I've also read bermuda does better if cut short, shorter the better actually.  It encourages it to spread out.

lawncare,3dydf8,sven_kirk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"Actually you only need to water deeply, about an inch or a tuna can, once a week for Bermuda. On a hill though, it will need to be more."

Starting from seed with Bermuda is difficult. But adding a slope onto it increases the difficulty. Height and fertilization sounds good. What weeds do you have and controls are you using?  The dormancy issue you can't control. That is a weather thing. It is going to take longer due to you being further up north than anything.  If it were me, I'd keep the Bermuda. Kill the weeds, and keep it low (for the summer) to help it spread. Bermuda is hard to kill and keep out. It is going to come back."

If I do bermuda, the yard would hopefully be green May-September, but then brown Oct/Nov - April.   If I do two-three applications of glysophosphate in early August, I should kill it before overseeding with fescue in early Sept...do you agree?"

Also, increase the amount of light and air-circulation in the area where the mushrooms are popping up.   You won't be able to get rid of the fungus in the soil very easily as you seem to be pointing towards a buried tree or similar.

Once it dies out when temps rise, it leaves dead patches that the good grass eventually covers up.  The dead patches that look like chemical spill does look very much like a spill.. Very interesting. Make sure that your mower fuel/ other equipment isn't leaking fuel/ oil? Otherwise, I would guess round up or something similar has been spilled here, although it could be a fungus, which I've never had to deal with..  As for the small holes, it could be beetles, moles, cicadas, armadillos, or deer. Slugs won't do that, although they will eat the grass (which can lead to disease damage). Sprinkle some slug pellets around your garden bed (if you have one) and shady/ wet areas.   Another good pesticide to use is permethrin. It's short term, but will knock out whatever is there almost immediately. Whether it's bugs or animals making the holes, getting rid of the bugs will help.   Use the permethrin sparingly. I get a 32 oz bottle of the 36% concentrate (amazon) and do 2-3 applications a year to control ticks and fleas, and it works great! It can burn some plants, so try not to spray on a hot dry day."

Depending on where you live, spring or fall treatments will be most effective.   http://www.scotts.com/smg/goART2/contentArticle/poa-annua-control/34300027  You could also try overseeding to choke it out.

lawncare,3dfotu,mattisinthemountains,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Should I pull the orchardgrass up?  Or is it seasonal and will die off on its own?  BTW I used Pennington KY31 Penkoteed(sp?) last year in the early fall.  In the mid fall I used pennington One Step Complete for Tall Fescue to fill patches. In the very spring, I used Pennington Smart Seed  Sun and Shade mix on a shady area.   The orchardgrasd is everywhere though.  Must have come from the Pennington Ky31 that I broadcasted everywhere.   The previous owners neglected the back yard. When I purchased the house, it was in Feb of last year. The backyard was completely neglected. Weeds and dirt/mud pits.   Maybe this is just some orchardgrass seeds that were exposed when I tilled the yard before the KY31 spreading."
lawncare,3deqf8,Volkditty,5,Wed Jul 15 18:18:15 2015 UTC,Its dog pee burn. You laid down sod which came from a farm that adds lots of nitrogen to their grass. Then the dog pees on it adding more nitrogen into the grass and burning it

lawncare,3deqf8,mrscissorhands4,2,Thu Jul 16 01:54:11 2015 UTC,Lol thanks. Dilution is the solution to pollution.  Anyways you may try replacing the shadiest part of the lawn (top of pic?) with pea gravel for a mini potty area for your dogs. Just use pressure treated lumber and square it off.

lawncare,3deqf8,d-d-d-donkey,2,Thu Jul 16 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"You can definitely patch spots in the summer,  you just need to keep the patches moist while the grass is sprouting. If it's grubs, you can kill them off relatively quickly, and patch the spots. If it's dog piss, which I believe is definitely a factor if not the majority of the problem, you need to really dig out that soil, or the same chemicals that killed the grass will still be there tainting the soil."
lawncare,3deqf8,towmader,2,Wed Jul 15 21:18:31 2015 UTC,"If urine burn is the primary culprit, will it kill off the new grass seed before it has a chance to fill in? Also, is tall fescue a good grass to reseed with, or is there another species that would hold up to pets better?"
lawncare,3deqf8,ickykarma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"The urine that killed, certainly won't help, that's why I said to dig it out, and replace the soil. I'm in Chicago and I use a mix of Scott's Midwest blend along with that EZ seed to patch bad spots (I live on a corner lot with a lot of dog walking), and that always works for me. Scott's also has that mix just for neutralizing dog urine patches, you could look at that too."
lawncare,3dbwwm,DariusMDeV,5,Wed Jul 15 01:55:53 2015 UTC,"Not to give you ""homework"" but here is an extensive explanation of what I'm about to say:  Link from University of Maryland  For most homeowners we deal with, it's all about a threshold level. So will say that threshold is 75% weeds, some will say 50% weeds. This means, at 50% weeds or less you should aerate/overseed/fertilize. At 50% weeds or more you should re-do the whole damn thing; burn it all with fire and start fresh.   What you are asking, is a slightly different question but under the same concept. It really depends on how much weeds we're talking about. If it's a lot of weeds, you need to go more full-scale. If it's just a couple weeds and you don't need a 100% weed-free lawn. Weed-n-feed should be just fine.  For me, I will always aerate, overseed, and fertilize REGARDLESS because it helps my lawn stay immaculate. I will never ""weed-n-feed"" for one because it doesn't provide (IMHO) long-term benefit and it's a chemical solution."
lawncare,3dbwwm,ickykarma,3,Wed Jul 15 13:55:37 2015 UTC,Does your lawn consist of creeping grasses that will spread on their own? How big are the areas the grass needs to spread into? How long are you willing to wait for that process to happen?
lawncare,3dbwwm,teovall,3,Wed Jul 15 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't have grass with runners, like saint augustine, then you will have to seed to fill spots."
lawncare,3dbwwm,PrincessTacoTaco,2,Wed Jul 15 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes a little trial and error because each climate, soil and grass type can vary. Identify the grass you want and water accordingly. I prefer a time-released fertilizer ( http://www.simplot.com/productImages/fullSized/surf_turf_25-5-5.1683.jpg )to prevent erratic pH spikes and drops. Using this ( http://image.dhgate.com/albu_315161730_00-1.0x0/3-in-1-garden-plant-soil-test-kits-ph-tester.jpg ) will help determine when to apply.  Aerate annually or seasonally depending on compaction from traffic. It allows for exchange of air, moisture and nutrients within the soil.  Good Luck!"

lawncare,3dakjj,Spreadsheeticus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Georgia's law on MSMA, but there are no chemicals that you can buy that specifically treat dalisgrass.  From what I've found, Roundup is pretty much the only thing that will work.   Some nice users on this forums suggested to carefully apply roundup to as much of the dalisgrass as possible, by hand if necessary.    About 5-6 weeks ago, I carefully sprayed roundup over every patch or clump in my yard, and spread Bermuda seed the following weekend.  I don't have any before and after pictures to share, but the dalisgrass is now gone, and grass has rapidly taken over.   The alternative would be to hire a lawn chemical service to regularly treat your yard, but there isn't much pride in that :)"

lawncare,3darxy,EightOhSix,5,Tue Jul 14 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"Milorganite depending on what the bag says.  Mow high (so the grass is at least 3+"").  This will help choke out the weeds.  When it gets dry, water 1"" slowly so the water seeps into the soil and doesn't run off.  This way the grass roots will go deep following the water and be more drought resistant.  Aeration is to help soil that is compacted get looser.  Doesn't really hurt to do it no matter what your soil.  Don't use those aeration shoes that just jam a spike into the soil.  This just compacts the soil more.  You need a plug to be pulled.  As to when to areate:   ...the best time of the year to aerate cool-season grass, such as fescue, bluegrass or rye, is in August through October when the grass is breaking its dormancy and begins the period of active growth; the best time to aerate warm-season grass, such as Bermuda, Zoysia or St. Augustine, is April through June.

The grass is deadly short, and, depending on your weather recently, could use some deep (one inch) and infrequent watering to strengthen the root system. The rough strip needs to be tilled, and probably sprayed. A lot of weeds have little nutlets or rizomes that will allow them to regrow even years after the tops have been whacked. If it's not an area they want to keep up, landscaping or hedged ground cover may be a better answer."

Spray crabgrass with killer that has quinclorac, and follow up with a broadleaf killer with mecoprop & 2-4-D.  You may also want to try aerating that sandy patch, and add some topsoil. If you don't see any Bermuda in this area, you could treat the grass in this location with roundup/ glyphosate.  Check the labels and make sure they're safe for lawn use.

lawncare,3d2pc7,96dpi,4,Mon Jul 13 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"Organic Lawn Care for the Cheap and Lazy is a good place to start.  Now:    Milorganite Cut high Pop big weeds (dandelions, etc) out by hand (or you could get fancy) Water 1""+ slowly and deeply when you see that the top few inches of the soil is dry.    Fall:    Continue the above. Top dress with good soil. Overseed.   Notes:   Milorganite: organic nitrogen fertilizer. Cut high: By cutting the grass at 3-4"", it allows the grass to shade out the weeds and send down deep roots to survive times of stress.  Pop out weeds: You could go the broad leaf herbicide route.  I have a small yard, so I like to pop the big weeds out myself as it lets me evaluate the general state of the lawn at the same time. Watering slowly and deeply: Watering slowly lets the soil absorb the water instead of flooding the soil and the water running off.  Watering deeply makes the grass roots follow the water down, giving it stronger roots than the surrounding weeds.   This is a long term project.  There's no quick fix, but the effort is worth it.  Good luck!"

lawncare,3d2pc7,lovellama,2,Tue Jul 14 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'll just answer your questions in order for you.  Where do you start? Sharpen your mower blades, and raise your mower deck to 3 inches. You want to mow your grass high.  Start spraying weed killer? If you're up to it, I'd hand-weed the edges of the trouble areas and spray the largest clumps of clover. Spot-spraying is ok during the hotter summer months, but a blanket spraying of weed-killer or a weed and feed isn't a good idea.  Seed your grass in the fall. Actually, aeration, then overseed your grass in the fall. That's the #1 recommendation I have for you (next to the proper mowing mentioned before).  Fertilize when the hottest parts of summer have passed. Use organics."

lawncare,3cym6l,Schmidnick,2,Sat Jul 11 23:30:48 2015 UTC,Do some research on the type of tree.  Some get most of their nutrients from the taproot and those close to the soil don't help much.  Others really need those roots.  Doesn't look like you will get much grass under that tree anyway - so I would spend my energy on other things first probably.
lawncare,3cym6l,entropicitis,2,Sun Jul 12 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"No, obviously the tree would prefer to have it's roots intact.  And it doesn't look like you could have much of a lawn in it's shade anyway.  What kind of a tree is it?  It would probably survive if you removed them, then slowly decline.  Or you could just mulch the roots and give up the lawn and have a happier tree."
lawncare,3cym6l,only1interest,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:56:49 2015 UTC,I think its a Green Ash. Maybe a pecan tree. My backyard tree seems to be a pecan with 12 leaves per leaflet but this tree only has 5 to 7.
lawncare,3cym6l,only1interest,3,Sun Jul 12 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"If it is an ash, look up emerald ash borer and find a map to see if they are in your area.  Again, I think the shade and poor soil are bigger problems than the root.  The tree is probably a bigger asset than the lawn would be.  Set the mower on high is probably good advice anyway.  But that one main surface root is probably not big enough, relative to the size of the tree, that removing it would kill the tree or harm it very much."

In getting the sod established, you have to water zoysia frequently.  Frequent watering of a disease prone turf in poor soil conditions is a recipe for large patch.  You likely got a little disease, it ran it's course, and here's what you're left with.  If you were to run the fungicide route, it won't magically fix it, but it will stove off new disease formation a d allow recovery to begin.  You're looking at next year before full recover.  I'd call a professional to double check.  Go with a local company, not a national marketing one. Ask if they have a turfgrass degree."

lawncare,3clh7z,Infernal_NightGaunt,2,Wed Jul 8 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"I am not an expert on new sod but I know a few things.  First, watering 'as much as possible' probably isn't sufficient. New sod needs to keep damp until it roots. Normally somebody would run a popup sprinkler system 3 times a day from 10 to 20 minutes each time. That is a lot of water and probably more than you are doing by hand when you get a chance.  There is very little  possibility that the grass is dormant. If there are gaps between the sod  that indicates they are shrinking which is a pretty good sign that the sod is dead/dying. Can it be saved? I don't know, might be able to tell if you post some pictures. Whoever arranged for the sod to be laid before you moved in made a bad decision if there isn't an automatic sprinkler system. Unless you have a lot of spare time or live very close by (or it was cool and rained a lot) it would be pretty difficult to get the grass to root. Use a search engine to get tips on how to treat freshly laid sod.  You may be able to save some of it but the sections that have shrank are probably not gonna make it.  Good luck, I hope you can save some of it."

The soil appears compacted which is bad for water and nourishment to get deep in the soil as well as for the seeds. I recommend raking all debris and rocks off your lawn. Then moisten the soil by watering it and once moist aerating the lawn (breaking up the soil with an aerator or cultivator) then laying seed. After laying seed rake lightly to get the seed under some soil, I use a cultivator for this as well but there are many methods. After that light watering in the morning hours fo a week or so should do the trick and you will see new lawn sometime soon."
lawncare,3cb8yf,jgelderloos,2,Mon Jul 6 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"I have the same kind of grass as you. Unfortunately it is too late to plant new grass now. Your best bet is to wait until fall and then try to repair it. I would start out with dethatching, overseeding and then fertilizing. Also, ortho's weed b gon works extremely well against weeds. Just don't spray it on newly seeded grass.  If you have any other questions, let me know."

I re-did my lawn last fall and it was well worth it, and really not hard with a little bit of research.   Buy this book. Its like my lawn bible. Very helpful. It might have a scotts logo on the front but surprisingly its not a giant pitch for scotts products.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H7GEE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00  I went to a local garden center and picked up a soil sample kit thing. It was free, I took soil samples, and mailed it off to a lab in Virginia Tech and they analyzed my soil and made recommendations on what to add to it.   I bought a big backpack weedsprayer from Lowes, and lawn killer, and killed my whole lawn, made it brown in less than a day.   Then I mowed the grass as low as it would go.  I raked the crap out of it and made it as bare as possible. This was helpful. The less grass thats actually left in the ground will make it easier to rototill.   Tilled the whole lawn a few times, until I had the dirt pretty well mixed up.   Make sure you call *811 have have your utilities marked. I did, and even spoke to the people who came out to mark their lines. I asked the cable guy how deep the wire was buried, he told me 6 feet. It was more like 6 inches, and I went right through the cable line. No internet for 4 days.   I bought 3 yards of quality top soil, compost mix, and added that to my lawn. Tilled it in.  Raked the yard for what seemed like forever to get it flat and even.  Planted seed, watered on a sechedule to keep it moist.  My yard exploded into green lush oasis.  It was pretty easier for a first timer too."

Make sure you are getting a good connection there.    If you have a multimeter, put it in DC and put one lead on the blue wire connected to the solenoid and one lead on the white, start that zone on the controller and see if it reads voltage.  If it does read voltage you probably have a bad solenoid on that valve.  They sell just the solenoid at the home improvement stores (if they still make the valve you are working with).  If they don't have it, you'll have to replace that valve.  If you don't have a multimeter, take that wire nut off the blue wire and tie that black solenoid wire that was with the blue to the red and start zone 3.  If it comes on then there is an issue with the blue wire or the controller.  If it doesn't, you need a new solenoid / valve.  Most likely it will be that solenoid.  Those seem to be a big point of failure.  It looks like the other valve in that box is capped and not being used.  You could probably just unscrew that solenoid with the white wires on it and use it.  One wire will go to blue and the other to white, doesn't matter which to which."

Steps as follow:  Weed and feed in March  Scott's moss control (thought I could use that and hand rake but the moss was too thick, even dead.)  Rented power dethatcher and set it low to score the dirt and remove any moss and thatch. (Left things fairly bare) raked and bagged all dead stuff.   Raked the soil to loosen it up a little and even it out.   Laid down some pelletized lime (makes soil less attractive for moss to grow)  Used a broadcast spreader to lay down some Scott's sun and shade grass seed. Raked the seed into the soil.   Covered with lots of straw to help keep everything moist due to doing all this at the wrong time in the season.

lawncare,3c582o,J1U9N9E3,2,Sat Jul 4 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"Grass prefers sandy soil.  I wouldn't do much to the existing soil.   No maintenance on the lawn has happened in a number of years other than regular cutting   This looks like the problem, not the soil.   Since they live in Canada, they probably have a cool season turf. Like fescue, Kentucky bluegrass or rye (or a mix of all three).  Do this and the turf will improve  mowing  1). Cut at the highest blade setting  2). Never cut more than 1/3 of the total grass height at a time.  This means if the highest setting in your mower is 3.5 inches, cut it when it's about 4.5 inches tall.    3.) use the mulching setting on the mower, and always return the lawn clippings to the soil.    watering  1). Water 1 inch deep in a single session (about 45 minutes - hour, depending on your sprinkler).  Do this in one session so the water seeps deep. (Don't water water it every day, this encourages weeds)  2). Only water when the grass starts to look thirsty. That is, when the blades start to sag or fold or change color.  Google images of thirsty grass or stressed grass.  This means the roots have dug as deep as they can and can't find any more moisture. This is when you do another deep watering session.  3). Water in the early morning to avoid evaporation or wind drying out the water.  You want this water to get sucked jerk the soil.   fertilizing  1). Besides mowing and watering, feeding the lawn is the most important aspect of lawn care.  Feed the grass using a synthetic/chemical lawn food or an organic lawn food. Synthetics like Scott's Tuef Builder feed the roots directly but risk burning and killing the grass if you mess up.  Organics like Milorganite are ""idiot proof"" and won't kill your lawn if you mess up or spill.  I prefer organics because it provides a more even, steady growth  2). Assuming you have cool season grass, only fertilize in the fall.  Do it at the end of summer, middle of fall, and the end of fall.  If that's too much, do it at the end of summer and end of fall. If that's too much still, just do it at the end of summer.   overseed 1). Cool season grass doesn't usually spread around to fill in holes or thin areas (unless you have Kentucky bluegrass).  Overseed every year.  2). Before overseeding, it's a good idea to dethatch the lawn.  Thatch isn't grass clippings; rather, it is dead roots or dead grass.  it looks like your parents yard needs de thatching right now regardless of overseeding  3). This is debatable, but some folks also recommend aerating the lawn before overseeding.  I've had good results just spreading the seed and taking it in; but to each his own.    4). Only overseed cool season lawns at the end if summer or early fall.  If you do it in the summer, seedlings might not survive the heat. (Not sure what you are looking at heat wise in Canada, but cool season grass does the best when the soil temperature (not the temperature ) is not hot."
lawncare,3c4mvm,superfahd,2,Sat Jul 4 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"They are both right.   However, your lawn will not begin to look good at that height of cut without additional inputs.   Additionally, try to live by the ""1/3 rule"". Never cut more than 1/3 of the grass blade off.

There was an article that said something very similar about the grass getting used to the new way of cutting. Basically, when you switch from a regular mower to a reel mower, the first few months, the grass will look crappy until the grass adjusts. After it adjusts to the new cutting method, your lawn will look beautiful because reel mowers are generally less traumatic on grass as they cut grass like scissors do rather in a clean cut.

lawncare,3c4mvm,stradivariousoxide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"Generally, you don't want to cut more than 1/3 of the blade of grass because it will cause undue stress on the grass. Cutting too much off hurts the grass roots by inhibiting growth. So when you switch mowing methods, the grass gets a shock because it gets trimmed a lot more than normal. It will take a few months to recover. But by then, regularly cutting the grass will not result in dramatic loss so it won't inhibit root growth like it would when you switch cutting methods. In other words, the grass did not like going from 2 inches to 1.25, as it was a traumatic cut for the grass to handle. However, cutting it regularly , such as going from 1.75 inches to 1.25 is easier for the grass to handle, as the energy loss is not as traumatic."

Then, a week or so later, put the rest of the milorganite down.  But I caution you that: Insecticide will kill the pests you hate, but also the insects that hunt it kill them.  The predators of the pests will take longer to repopulate your lawn.  If the Prey starts going crazy baby booming, the predators will eventually have a similar boom (because more food).   Once the predators start wiping out the prey, they too will be wiped out (lack of food).  Repeat.  This is the natural cycle.  When you go nuclear with the insecticide, not all of the pests will be killed but you risk killing off the predators (or at least their ability to reproduce).  Eventually those pests will get up and running again to pester you, but there will be fewer if any predators to keep them in check.  If you wiped out all the predators, it may take long time for new predators to migrate there.  Tl;dr- if you let the insects do their thing, nature takes care of the pests for you."

lawncare,3bsku3,mattisinthemountains,2,Thu Jul 2 11:34:38 2015 UTC,Definitely mow low. No higher than an 1.5 inches.  As far as fertilizer. 1 pound of nitrogen per month per 1000ft2 during the growing season. Ammonium sulfate is the best way to go that will green the crap out of the lawn due to the temporary pH changes in the soil.  Your lawn looks great. Just needs to fill in a bit and low mowing is how to do that. If you want to get crazy you can verticut.   It is better to water less frequently more water each time. You may have to work up to a once a week watering though.  An inch a week is probably not enough. If you want to get technical about it you need to water to the ETo.   This site says you need 9.23 inches of water for July in Midland. Http://texaset.tamu.edu/pet.php   One inch a week isn't enough.  Just remember to count rainfall.
lawncare,3bsku3,growsgrass,3,Thu Jul 2 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"Couple things you need to start doing:   Mow HIGH. From the looks of the pictures you posted, it seems like you are mowing way too low. Mowing low causes the grass to burn under the sun's heat and also makes your grass less effective at competing with weeds. This is because taller grass provides shade to weeds, making it harder for weeds to get the sunlight they require in order to grow. Water 1"" per week. It is better to deep water your lawn twice a week (0.5"" each time) rather than watering it everyday. Watering everyday doesn't allow your grass to grow deeper roots. Water early mornings (preferably) or evenings. Not in the afternoon or at night. Watering in the afternoon isn't effective at all since the water is quickly evaporated by the sun's heat. Watering at night puts your lawn at a risk for diseases. Put down some milorganite fertilizer. This stuff is organic and contains iron which is what makes your lawn greener. It truly works like magic, just try it!   Good luck!"

lawncare,3bsku3,najama2,3,Wed Jul 1 22:02:31 2015 UTC,I would wait 1-2 weeks because ironite is synthetic. Milorganite is an organic slow release nitrogen fertilizer so you don't have to worry about burning your lawn ever. You can put down as much of it as your budget allows.

The middle number is phosphorous.  you will hear arguments on both sides of phosphorous.  it's probably most damaging to our environment, but it's also utilized by the plant immediately after germination to accelerate root development.    most soils have ample phosphorous, that's the importance of a soil test - to make sure your soil does.  in the years I've been on the professional side of lawn care, I prefer to use an organic, like milorganite, fertilizer, or an organically enhanced fertilizer containing biosolids.  I personally use a 24-0-12 50% biosolid from Lebanon turf when it comes time to overseed.  our soils in Knoxville are over abundant in phosphorous."

lawncare,3brjgq,mattisinthemountains,4,Wed Jul 1 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"if you have more phosphorous than required, then do not worry about adding more.  worry more about building soil quality, utilizing either compost or organic fertilizers, and getting pH back to near 7 or slightly acidic.  poor soil pH can bind phosphorous therefor making it unavailable to the plant.  correcting soil pH will make it available again.  but having an over abundance in your soil means you have plenty available for the plant and do not need to apply more (unless your pH is in the 4.5 or 9.0 range, and if it is, run an application of solu-cal for too acidic pH, or an application of Epson salt, magnesium sulfate, if too basic).  applying more phosphorous to an overabundant phosphorous soil will cause run off, leaching, and contribute to more organophosphates in our drinking water - yikes!"
lawncare,3br87d,owlnsr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"Another cultural practice which could help your turf grass fight back against this demon weed would be to incorporate aeration into your lawn care every spring and fall.

If I aerate and overseed in late Summer/early Fall (August in Central VA), the spots were lespedenza has taken root will not be hit by the broadcast of new seed.   If I do a second aeration and overseed in next year in the early Spring, I feel like an aeration would destroy the young grass that I would have just planted this Late Summer/Early Fall.    Would i be better off just aerating and overseeding in the Fall, and then letter use a lawn patch/repair mix to cover the bare spots where lespedenza died off in the winter?"
lawncare,3br87d,ickykarma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, aeration does kill some seed, it flings that soil core on top of the turfgrass. That said, the overall added benefit is healthy overall turf (even if a few have to die, the overall benefit is a plus).   If you'd like to use a lawn patch/repair mix, that surely would be better than nothing. I recommended the aeration post-seeding because it is my belief that your soil is a little too compacted. You seem to have all other grounds covered so this was my go-to thought. You see, lespedenza is a weed of opportunity, it likes areas with thinning turf that are dry and compacted. It is an annual weed so it grows in the summer and should die in the fall."

lawncare,3blsg9,ickykarma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the reply!  I think my post might have been a bit misleading. I haven't actually put down the milorganite or the medina soil activator. They have been sitting in my garage. I got both products off a recommendation but held off on putting them on the lawn. I think I will go ahead and put both down today as I've been told neither can really hurt the lawn. From reading around, it seems most people put down some sort of starter fertilizer with new sod, which I did not do.   I think overwatering may be a cause as I run the sprinklers 15 minutes at 6a.m. and again at 4p.m. for 15 minutes but since installing the sod, it has rained everyday at midday around noon. I figured with the Houston heat at high 80's/low 90's that this would not cause overwatering but I could be wrong.   The only time I'm on the lawn is to adjust the sprinkler heads or the timer otherwise no one steps on the lawn.   I do have a dog but he does not pee in the lawn. He never has, even before the sod. He prefers to pee on the community green on the other side of the community near the mailboxes.   Does it look like a possible fungus in the first few pics? I will definitely check my sprinklers heads and put cans down to measure how much water is going on the lawn. I do know that the 15 minutes that I run the sprinklers does not cause the sod to get squishy, just moist."

If so, contact then and ask if they have someone who could come take a look? I would recommend changing your watering schedule. One longer watering in the morning might provide a heavy enough watering that you wouldn't have to follow up in the afternoon. If you still need extra watering inn the afternoon make sure you irrigate early enough for it to dry out before night time. It's important to keep it wet until it begins to root in, then you can modify the watering schedule. It's a fine line between enough water and too much water and can be aggrevating."
lawncare,3blsg9,ickykarma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"It could definitely be a disease such as brown patch.
