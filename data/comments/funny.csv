funny,3c7xbi,8anjofrog,The only thing worse with rice.
funny,3c7xbi,waterdrinker9,"10/10 the mosquitoes will lift you off your bed. Had to spend a night middle of a rice field without repellent. Double socks, pajama tucked into them, hoodie on with the string tied tightly around my neck, face covered with a towel. Still woke up looking like my entire body was covered in Chicken pox.\n\nEdit:Early 2000's, The Philippines. We were originally planning on traveling from Sagada to Bontoc but missed the last Jeepney that ply that route. Since it takes anywhere from 4-7 hours, their last departure is usually sometime after lunch. (Protip: DO not travel that mountainous path in the monsoon season like we did) We figured since we'll be staying for another day we'd do some additional hiking into the valley. Since my partner had known someone in a village about 8km away when she was doing research a few years earlier, we decided to pay her a visit. What we didn't count on was the torrential rains and fog the entire way. By the time we got there, it was dusk and it took us a while to locate the lady.( My partner had to find someone at the local school who was bilingual). We had supper with the old lady and shared our cans of Spam, Vienna sausages and beans with her. By the time we were getting ready to leave, it had grown really dark, stronger rain, and the person from the school( who was our translator) advised us that the path up hill would be somewhat dangerous. \n\nIts always a good idea to not do stupid in a foreign country. Home base, go crazy, but never do full stupid in another country. So we decided to stay(The area is pretty safe but occasionally bad things happen) and the old lady offered her place(surrounded by rice fields) to us. But since she had limited resources we pretty much bundled up on a Coir mattress on the floor. And since we weren't planning on staying over night we also didn't bring much in the way of bug protection.  \n\nAnd that's how I learned that in a rice field mosquitoes can and will lift you at least a foot off your bed.\n\nSuper potato quality since I took pictures of pictures with my phone just now.\nThe old lady and the school lady.\n\n/u/supamonkey77 on the way back up and the sky also starting to clear up"

I think it's safe enough to assume that he did it as a way to feel close to his fallen soldiers.  Big Boss has always been a strange guy but his soldiers are basically his world.  For anyone that's going to be playing The Phantom Pain, you're going to see Big Boss transform as a leader from someone who created a safe haven for soldiers into a tyrant that wants to create a world dominated by soldiers."

funny,3c8ebd,gecko,Um... fewer is for count nouns. Your source even says that.
funny,3c8ebd,Cluelessnub,"Please read past the very first sentence. The Wikipedia article goes to some lengths to explain the origins of the rule (documented and recent, 18th century) and provide copious counterexamples. In fact, these counterexamples are whence I grabbed my citations; to whit:\n\n\nAs far as we have been able to discover, the received rule originated in 1770 as a comment on 'less': This Word is most commonly used in speaking of a Number; where I should think Fewer would do better. ""No Fewer than a Hundred"" appears to me, not only more elegant than ""No less than a Hundred,"" but more strictly proper. (Baker 1770). Baker's remarks about 'fewer' express clearly and modestly – 'I should think,' 'appears to me' – his own taste and preference....Notice how Baker's preference has been generalized and elevated to an absolute status and his notice of contrary usage has been omitted.""\nAlfred the Great was a prolific writer and translator of the time, and used less with counting nouns, e.g. around 888 AD:[5]\n\n\nSwa mid læs worda swa mid ma, swæðer we hit yereccan mayon.\n\n\nWith less words or with more, whether we may prove it.\n\n\nThis whole concept of argument I honestly find ridiculous, though. English, like all languages, has evolved over time. Unless you want to happily belt out such phrases as ""We Gardena in geardagum,\nþeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon"" or ""Wann that Aprille with his shoures soote the droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote"" when you meet me, you're not speaking the oldest forms of English we know. This means you're speaking some dialect that evolved at some time or another, and I don't seriously believe your version is any better than mine or anyone else's except in number of speakers."

funny,3c8ebd,Number127,"You're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot."
funny,3c8ebd,Pentium123,I never even got past episode two.. does it get better?
funny,3c8ebd,Rasral123,"It does. The first season was very..awkward. They were trying to copy The Office and it wasnt very good. After season 1 they really came into their own, dropped the whole ""The Office"" act and focused on their own brand of humor."
funny,3c8ebd,corpuscle634,"Yup. P&R was intentionally designed to be a loose spinoff of The Office, because NBC was just grasping at straws and wanted all of its shows to copy the one success it had. The first season was thus a sort of clunky mess which was only saved by the actors' performances.\n\nOnce the showrunners realized that the drier ""realist"" Office brand of comedy wouldn't work, they let Poehler and co. actually try things artistically, and it blossomed into something great."
funny,3c8ebd,Jeanpuetz,"I loved the first Season. I agree that they hadn't found their tone yet, but I still thought it was hilarious.\n\nI was drunk when I watched it though, so that probably helped a lot."
funny,3c8ebd,umbrellasinjanuary,"Once the penguin episode hits, it explodes.  It's like a totally separate show."
funny,3c8ebd,sanitysepilogue,So... Season two? But I totally agree
funny,3c8ebd,sonofaresiii,"It gets infinitely better. It's definitely a show where most of the humor comes from building on itself, running gags, that sort of thing. Plus it just took them a while to find their voice. Skip season one and go straight to two."
funny,3c8ebd,ogdonut,I happened to start watching it when a friend just finished season 1. Couldn't be happier. I honestly feel like I haven't missed anything.
funny,3c8ebd,ThirdFloorGreg,"To quote someone from the show (I think one of the writers) during a panel discussion when season one was mentioned ""We don't talk about those shitty episodes!"""
funny,3c8ebd,pliers_agario,Skip the first season and you'll lose nothing. Start with S2E1 and you'll be happier for it.
funny,3c8ebd,plasmanautics,"Yep. Every time I tried to start watching from season 1, I just stopped watching it. But last year, I took my friend's advice to start at season 2, and I binged through in like two weeks."
funny,3c8ebd,fatalblur,"However, after you watch the whole series and go back, season 1 is actually not bad. That's been my experience at least."
funny,3c8ebd,charlesdexterward,Season one is rough. Skip to season 2. You won't miss anything terribly important.
funny,3c8ebd,Calverfa6,"I've been on the edge of watching it but, you're the fourth to say it so, I'm skipping season one and going straight to season to tonight."
funny,3c8ebd,DeadDuck144,"Boo. You need the Pit's backstory.\n\nThere's only six episodes in the first season, and they really aren't that bad; the characters just aren't very likable until season two."
funny,3c8ebd,corpuscle634,"Skip the first season. It changes drastically from a stylistic perspective, and really comes into its own. Season 1 is an attempt by NBC execs to spawn an Office clone, and it didn't work, but the show comes into its own in S2.\n\nThe real turning point of the show is S02E05, where Fred Armisen seems to ride in on a golden chariot and remind the other actors how incredibly talented they are. From there on, it's absolute nonstop gold."
funny,3c8ebd,sonfold_hero,"First season is bad. Skip it.\n\nRecap: There's a hole that Andy (who dates Ann) falls into and breaks his leg. Ann complains at a Parks meeting and Leslie says she'll not only fill it in, she'll make it a park. \n\nReally the rest of it doesn't much matter. Start at Season 02."
funny,3c8ebd,Rountree1,"I don't get why everyone is telling him to skip season 1? Yeah, it's not as good as later seasons but it's not horrible. Why not just let him decide for himself if he wants to watch it?"
funny,3c8ebd,sonofaresiii,Two weeks? You could knock it out in two days man.
funny,3c8ebd,Leftys-Wheelchair,It would take you 2 weeks?\n\nI'd have that shit down in a 4-5 day process. I would say a weekend but I don't think that's statistically possible.

Shadows and everything looks normal. Looks like it was filmed in an ordinary german pedestrian zone"
funny,3c9jqa,Nachteule,It's the filter of the camera - it's called tilt shift effect - it creates a small focus in the center and blurs the rest. Used in panorama scenes with increased color saturation all looks like miniatures. Used in this context it creates the focus on the actors and not the other people. The same effect can also used to focus on a face.
funny,3c9jqa,SharkApocalypse,It's likely to just be a lens with a shallow Depth of field.
funny,3c9jqa,tuffzinator,actually its just the tilt-effect or just a shot with small depth of field. a tilt-shift-lens is a special kind of lens which combines the two effects: tilt and shift effect.
funny,3c9jqa,MVolta,"This video does NOT use a filter and you do NOT need to tilt or shift to get a ""small focus in the center and blur the rest"". \n\nThis is actually called shallow depth of field and you just need a long lens and/or a wide aperture.\n\n\n\nTilting and shifting makes it so that the angle of the plane of focus in not parallel to the film surface"

funny,3c9jqa,truesly1,it's just super shallow Depth of field. caused by long lenses and/or wide open apertures. a lot of amateurs with DSLRs think it makes there work look 'filmic'
funny,3c9jqa,aclockwork_ffa500_,"While true, I think they do this on purpose here. They are filming in public and don't want to have to get everyone in the shot to sign a release form. And it would look like a reality T.V show instead of a sketch."

The only reason they don't eat the main characters is that they worship C-3PO. They probably ate the Imperials after killing them. Heck, they probably yelled at Luke for overcooking Vader. Oh, plus the fact they randomly have a crap ton of weapons and combat training and giant traps. What sort of primitive society knows how to build traps made for giant walkers?

It's less a ""revelation"" than a basic plot point that everyone forgot about in their hurry to repeat lame jokes about stormtroopers missing over and over.\n\nEdit:  I guess they did get trounced pretty hard by the Ewoks, though.  Blame George for that one."
funny,3c8b4y,meowskywalker,"I always choose to believe that there are endless scores of Ewoks being murdered ""Zulu"" style right offscreen and it's sheerly a numbers game for the rebels, as they slowly whittle down their technologically advanced foe by throwing more bodies than the stormtroopers can cut down.\n\nBut, yeah, it looks a teensy bit ridiculous.

His co-pilot is dead, and luck/plot armor is all that saved him. I definitely saw plenty of other Rebels die, and Han/Leia/Chewie/C-3P0's escape in the Falcon only works because the pursuing pilots are too busy dodging asteroids to aim.\n\nThen you get to Cloud City, where Vader is usually ordering his men not to shoot. Egregious incompetence is again in short supply. \n\nIn Return, Jabba's thugs are doing the shooting for the first half of the movie, so that hardly counts. And on Endor, poor sightlines in the jungle and overwhelming odds don't stop Leia from having a hole drilled in her shoulder even from relatively secure cover (the entire point of OP). \n\nThe fact is, most of the shooting done by Stormtroopers happens in ANH, and it's only egregiously bad when it's supposed to be. In ESB and RotJ, their marksmanship is far from deplorable when it is displayed."
funny,3c8b4y,Tier_None,"Thank you for laying it out, I see time and time again where people stop thinking about the big picture of the OT when it comes to stormtroopers. I hope JJ Abrams gives them a solid boost and they wipe an important character or two with ease to put it all to rest."

And then they spend more time running at that point.\n\nYou have the Battle of Yavin, where he gets bailed by Wedge and Han once each. However, R2 does get wrecked by a TIE fighter. So his ship does take some hits.\n\nIn ESB, the Battle of Hoth sees him having direct hit on his speeder by an AT-AT that doesn't blow it up but does kill his co-pilot.\n\nAt Cloud City, the Stormtroopers are told to stand down by Vader and Boba Fett is instructed not to kill him. So that's washed out.\n\nIn ROTJ, you have the speeder bike chase before he turns himself in to Vader. In the chase, he dodges every tree and blaster bolt before becoming tangled with another bike. He then takes the perfect swing and cuts the front off a Stormtrooper's bike.\n\nAll in all, Luke's plot armor is pretty thick but not nearly as thick as it could have been."
funny,3c8b4y,dougsbeard,"Surprisingly, there really is a good reason why the Stormtroopers were not that good of shots when shooting at the main characters.\n\nhttp://www.cracked.com/article_18858_the-biggest-star-wars-plot-hole-explained-by-science.html"
funny,3c8b4y,D_Ciaran,Still doesn't explain why they miss every single shot in every other medium. Most recent example: Rebels.
funny,3c8b4y,darth_taco_117,"They could have had the same orders, especially since the characters in the cartoon series were repeatedly harassing Imperial forces. They would have liked to arrest them and torture/interrogated them."
funny,3c8b4y,D_Ciaran,They ordered them to take the Jedi alive and kill the rest.
funny,3c8b4y,Zexis,really hope we get to see some badass stormtrooper operatin' in the next movie and that the protags don't have constant +10 plot armor

funny,3c8b4y,the_lamentors_three,"To be fair, the imperial guard would be a lot more effective than storm troopers. Yeah, as infantry they suck, but they have tanks and artillery the likes of which the rebel alliance has never even conceived of."
funny,3c8b4y,wolfonealpha,"the reason why the Astra Militarum(i.e. Imperial Guard) infantry seem is useless is because they fight and i quotes.\n*Ancient Murdering Robots that destroy the laws of physics with their tech and don't die even if they are nuked, \n*Genetically engineered killing machines, \n*The evil twin brother of the Genetically engineered killing machines, with equally evil goatees, \n*Extremely warlike genetically-engineered fungus able to grow bigger and stronger the more they fight.\n*Manipulative space elves in possession of extremely cheesy technology and can jump around making damn accurate shots like Quake players, \n*The above-mentioned space elves' emo, bondage obsessed cousins who like to meet interesting people, shoot them a little, then torture them for eternity,\n *Highly-advanced space Communists with mecha and god-like firepower that surprisingly uses Combined Arms Warfare more than Imperial Guard. \n*And last but not lest Mutant 10ft tall space monsters with lots of teeth to devour you with Come in such a huge swarms that you literally run out of ammo before your guns can chew through half of them. \nJust to name a few.\n(source) http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Imperial_Guard"

funny,3c8b4y,ThatIckyGuy,"Or maybe it's set to stun because Darth Vader wants to interrogate and/or corrupt and/or torture Princess Leia.\n\nAlthough, given where it hit her, it looks like it just grazed her."
funny,3c8b4y,DreadPiratesRobert,Stun looks different.

funny,3c8b4y,jjmitchell,He obviously was aiming at Han.  Still a pretty good miss hit though

funny,3c860j,13zath13,Done
funny,3c860j,SkeeverTail,That would work if the delivery person actually did what was on the comments. Our doorbell is broken and I always make sure to let them know to call. But they always knock.
funny,3c860j,toonicetosayno,"Hello. Pizza delivery guy here (side gig). I will call or text if the notes say to do so, but I HATE doing it. I don't want random customers having my personal cell number. It's not like we get work phones. Luckily the vast majority of customers that request this are normal, but I have had 2 people start texting me later on. One said his order was wrong, but it was days later and I wasn't even working. One asked what time we closed. And again I wasn't working. Some people are just that stupid/rude."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,You make a very good point. What if the driver didn't even have a cell phone?
funny,3c860j,crashlanded,"Also a possibility. It's pretty rare though. Of all of our drivers, only 1 doesn't have a phone."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,I hope he at least has a standalone GPS...
funny,3c860j,jarejay,"Nope, but he spent his entire life in the area so he knows it well."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,Even then it's not that hard to figure out most city street systems... I worked as a pizza driver in a time before cell phone data or gps ;)
funny,3c860j,ohh_balls,Get a Google voice number!
funny,3c860j,NotElizaHenry,I have one that I use for my real job. I can't have 2 GVs and 1 actual number on the same phone.
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,Maybe use the number you gave your main job as your number for the side job and your actual one for the main job.
funny,3c860j,thombrown,"Can't. The primary reason I use the GV is for one number to ring multiple lines. I can give clients one number, but have it ring my office phone, home VOIP line, and cell (which gets less than ideal service for client calls when I'm at home) at the same time. I can also transfer calls with GV so if a client calls while I'm driving home, I can transfer it to my VOIP rather than standing outside in the heat/cold/rain/creepers-watching-me."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,"*67, you're welcome"
funny,3c860j,LaMaverice,"And then the customer thinks I'm a telemarketer, doesn't answer, I stand there for 5 minutes looking like a moron, go back to the store saying it was undeliverable, the customer calls the store asking where the pizza is, I go back, and repeat..."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,"If I'm hungry, have specified that delivery person should call and am waiting on some delicious yummy melted cheese and soft, fresh-baked doughy goodness in a box? I'm answering every phone call.  On the first ring."
funny,3c860j,LaMaverice,"Well, I'll test this theory tomorrow night then. Actually, I know it wouldn't work. Half the time customers don't answer and my number isn't blocked and is a local area code now. Blocking it would just make it worse."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,Why can't you just text someone at work for them to call?
funny,3c860j,goetzjam,That customer is a fucking idiot then
funny,3c860j,HardestNipple,Just write something like this back to the annoying ones: \n\nTHIS IS AN AUTOMATED REPLY. THE NUMBER YOU HAVE TEXTED IS NOT CURRENTLY IN OPERATION. PLEASE CALL BOB'S PIZZA AT: 0123456789.
funny,3c860j,swarmonger,"I just write ""Call the store directly"" and if they continue, block them."
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,"I deliver too, we have people that put to call so I call them, but since I have a Ga area code and live all the way in Ca people won't answer. So it sucks, just incase you wanna know my life struggles."
funny,3c860j,reefman_22,The struggle is real.
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,Get a Google vouce #  I used to work for a place that made us call from our phones. Yeah I don't want a bunch of weirdos calling and texting. So I just did that. Worked great. They have an app you can use on your smartphone
funny,3c860j,ashnharm02,call the store and have them call the customer....
funny,3c860j,despaxes,Use the app text now. \nYou'll get a VoIP cell number which you can change up anytime you want.
funny,3c860j,RoninSpartan,"Yeah I'm always unimpressed with how illiterate most delivery drivers are. I deliver for a living, I would read your note, laugh, and oblige.\n\nWhen I order from places with a high turn over no one seems to know what to do. Ordered Chinese food and the guy (owner -Sam's off studemont in Houston ) started to cuss me out about how hard it was to find my place.\n\nMy place is weird to find, granted, but all odd numbers are on one side of the road and evens on the other. This guy had the audacity to yell at me about how he drove around for twenty minutes struggling to find me and didn't bother to call me once. \n\nI gave him a dollar for a tip and never ordered again. Don't try to bullshit another delivery guy, call the customer if you can't figure out how addresses work... which ain't hard"
funny,3c860j,PicklesOfDethklok,"Maybe he imaged you would be angry that he is late, so he decided to out - angry you"
funny,3c860j,Cuntttttt,thats some scientology way of thinking if he did. Smash through suppressive people!
funny,3c860j,PicklesOfDethklok,"I don't have an address because I have a standalone apartment in someone's backyard with a private driveway. If someone drives into their driveway, they have aloud alert go off, so I want to avoid that at all costs. At the pizza chains around here, the memo line is only about 20 characters, so I plead for them to call in as short of words as I can come up with. About 80% of the time, they ignore my instructions. Now I have to call after I place online orders and explain the importance of reading the freaking memos"
funny,3c860j,beccafool,Why not just call the order in. You're going to call them anyway...
funny,3c860j,Theyreillusions,Because that means human interaction. Online I can just poke the pepperonis and it gets al pepperoni-y.
funny,3c860j,Forever_Awkward,Online I can just poke the pepperonis and it gets al pepperoni-y.\n\n\nThis made me lol for real.

funny,3c860j,trexarmwrestler,Yeah but he calls for special instructions for his house anyway
funny,3c860j,Theyreillusions,"Bubbles, is that you?"
funny,3c860j,Bigcros,You assume that delivery drivers are required to carry a cell phone. We are not. Mine is broken right now. You could fix your doorbell and shit.
funny,3c860j,Nooncoon420,"Guy says he's a delivery driver, has 420 in name. Checks out he's probably legit."
funny,3c860j,shit_lord,"Honestly that should be a requirement. Not only is it important for convenience, but also safety (being able to call law enforcement because shit happens as a delivery driver) and dispatchers should be able to contact their drivers if they need to be called back or if their route needs to be changed."
funny,3c860j,alonelygrapefruit,Wanna buy me a phone then?
funny,3c860j,Nooncoon420,You can buy a shit phone brand new for £10 in the UK. You can probably get one for comparable prices elsewhere.
funny,3c860j,Brandaman,Remember back when these evil devices didn't exist?
funny,3c860j,x1xHangmanx1x,Another good point. One of my drivers doesn't have a cell phone.
funny,3c860j,Tr2v,They NEVER listen to my comments.
funny,3c860j,firecrackergirl,"No, we listen, but a lot of stuff gets carried over from previous orders even if it doesn't apply still, and we don't know what is new and what isn't. My advice, put the date next to the comment so that they know it's fresh. Give a quick call to the store if you feel the need, but we need to know that instructions still apply just because they can carryover needlessly. \n\nEdit: in delivery drivers' defense, you can thank your fellow customers who give incorrect information, don't answer their doors, and then don't answer their phones when the driver calls to figure out where to take their food for why a lot of drivers don't bother unless they know it's a recent request. Customers just don't answer their phones."

funny,3c7qdt,JoePits,"Jet fuel can't melt dank memes....\n\nSteel beams lose roughly 90% of their integrity at around 1470 degrees farenheit. This why even just room and content fires in structures such as warehouses see bent beams in the aftermath of a collapse. \nJet Fuel on the other hand burns north of 1700 Farenheit. This is not including heat generated by contents and other aspects of construction in the world trade center. \n\nNow consider how much weight those Steel Beams were holding since they were weight bearing, then remove 90% of their structural ingerity.....\nTell me what happens...\n\nTechnically, yes steel will not melt when exposed to even the peak temperatures of Jet Fuel...but deform, even a regular fire can deform steel beams.\n\nSource: Firefighter."
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,"Why did all the floors collapse and not just the floors above the collision? I'm NOT a conspiracy theorist and I don't think there is a conspiracy, I'm just curious."
funny,3c7qdt,bravoredditbravo,"The floors where the crashes occurred gave out. All the floors above them came down. The force exerted on the lower floors by the upper floors caused them to pancake, setting off a chain reaction of sorts."
funny,3c7qdt,Surely_Relevant,Huh. It's as if I could've come to the same conclusion if I just spent 0.5 seconds thinking about it.
funny,3c7qdt,RedAnarchist,Well to start with large portions of the burning fuel ran down along the main structural supports that were steel beams. When the remaining floors above the collision point collapsed the weight mixed with the stress caused by the very intense fire was just to much for the remaining structure. That much weight impact loading on the beams just collapsed them. \n\nI do want to stress that I am the furthest possible thing from a structural engineer and that this simply is my understanding and my view of event. My experience is with commercial structures and residential homes. Not skyscrapers.
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,"Showered with debris, riddled with fires, weakened by intense heat. It's not unreasonable for a structure to give out under those conditions."

funny,3c7qdt,entropicresonance,"Nope a B-52 never hit the empire state building, if god forbid it did, the empire state building would be the parliment state building, the incident you're referring to is when a B-25 bombed hit the empire state, a much smaller aircraft, it was also much lighter, being at about 30,000 pounds while the planes that hit the world trade center were infact 274000 pounds, the airliners also carried more fuel and were going much faster than the B-25 aswell, they also hit the tower at a vertical slant."
funny,3c7qdt,malfunction19,Believe it or not a B-52 with no payload compared to a modern commercial airliner are two very different entities.
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,They found thermite at ground zero.
funny,3c7qdt,_SeeD_,"Its true. People need to stop blowing everything off as a ""conspiracy"" and actually research the things that happen\naround them."
funny,3c7qdt,suprahigh420,"What about building 7? or the crash of flight 93? Have you ever seen the wreckage of a real plane crash? Because what they showed us of flight 93 was a field with some dirt moved around; no remains of a plane whatsoever. Keep informed and an open mind. 911 was an inside job. The evidence is literally overwhelming. There are SO many reasons why the United States WOULD consider a terrorist attack on itself, research operation northwoods and false flag proposals. Bush had the draft for war plans in Iraq on his desk on September 9th, 2001 - two days before 911. keep informed."
funny,3c7qdt,suprahigh420,"Jet Fuel on the other hand burns north of 1700 Farenheit. This is not including heat generated by contents and other aspects of construction in the world trade center.\n\n\nWhile you are entirely correct, weakening of the beams by the heat caused structural failure, this part is incorrect. \n\nUnless there were other aspects of the building, that once ignited burned at a higher temp than the jet fuel itself, then the other fire had no impact. \n\nIf the drywall is next to a beam, burning at 1100 degrees (or anything less than the the temp of the beams) then it would have the exact opposite effect on the melting beams."
funny,3c7qdt,PenisInBlender,"Once again the beams weren't melting.\n\nThink of all the construction materials, plastics, wood, carpet etc that were on each floor of that structure, think of the impact of the blast as well.\nYes drywall is technically fire retardant it is not fire proof. \nIt does gradually fail, and it does fail faster at higher temperatures. It will not simply save a building. It is designed to buy time, not to stop fire 100% \n\nAnd yes while the jet fuel burnt hottest, content fires also do have an impact. Just because a room has a material burning at 1700 and other objects are ignited it does not mean that 1700 is the maximum temperature of the fire. It will burn and the effects of additional materials will only serve to increase the amount of thermal energy released. It will burn hotter than 1700"
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,"Two things bother me about this band of logic:\n\n1.) If jet fuel can burn at a maximum of 1,700 degrees, it would have to be in a very controlled environment. If there are fire retardant materials or if the fire is starved for oxygen at any point, it will dial down. I hardly see the inside of a skyscraper to be ideal conditions for a jet fuel fire.\n\n2.) The notion that fire can weaken steel beams seems to have a consensus but there no other examples of fire ever bringing down a building, let alone a skyscraper as far as I have seen. You can see that jet fuel burns at higher temps than a regular fire, but then you still can't explain WTC7.\n\nIt seems to me like there are two sides to the 9/11 story; the people who are uncertain of what happened but are leaning towards something being funky, and the people who are certain of what happened. I don't see why the former are considered irrational (akin to religious) instead of vice versa."
funny,3c7qdt,Track607,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8XMTALBYRNA\nHere's a video of a building collapse second to a structural fire.\nThere are actual studies and fatality reports done by the CDC and NIOSH that analyze the reasons firefighters were killed in structural collapses. \nThere is also a study into type 1 and 2 structures collapsing due to stress on structural supports caused by fire. \nThe fact you've never seen a building collapse due to fire doesn't mean that it doesn't occur.\n\nAnd starved for oxygen? There was a giant fucking hole in the building...one might even say it was horizontally ventilated. And fire retardant materials are things like drywall, insulation. Think of all the other stuff, papers, carpet, wood, office cubicles, computers, various stuff like that etc....  \n\nAlso the fact you think anyone who believes that the scientifically possible explanation of a structural collapse secondary to fire and an explosion is irrational and that anyone that is religious is also irrational seems like a generalization.\nInstead of jumping to the most unlikely explanation of government conspiracy to secure oil in the middle east (which if you had researched you'd know the brits profited off those oil contracts in Afghanistan and Iraq way more than we did. And that america only held a small percentage of oil contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan) we jumped to the conclusion that there was a simple scientific?answer. In this case, I would hardly say those that feel that it was a terrorist attack and that the reason the towers collapsed is simple are akin to those grasping for the most unlikely and complicated answer. If anything the conspirators are more representative of a religious like belief."
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,"Here's a video of a building collapse\n\n\nA video which shows the top floors collapsing while leaving the rest of the building intact.\nHow does this explain the way (at the very least) WTC7 collapsed, straight down, without noticeable external fire at (if I recall correctly) freefall speed?\n\n\nThe fact you've never seen a building collapse due to fire doesn't mean that it doesn't occur.\n\n\nNot sure what you were referring to by this. This is the internet; if it's not here (written about, photographed, etc.) it doesn't exist.\n\n\nAnd starved for oxygen? There was a giant fucking hole in the building.\n\n\nA hole? Really? A hole seems like optimal conditions to you?\nIt doesn't matter how giant it was. It's a fraction of the amount of oxygen you'd get even out in the open. Not to suggest that fires don't burn inside a structure, but they certainly don't reach maximum temperatures.\n\n\nThink of all the other stuff, papers, carpet, wood, office cubicles, computers, various stuff like that etc....\n\n\nI'd say you're grasping at straws here.\nPaper, maybe, but the rest certainly wouldn't cause the flame to burn at a higher temperature, certainly not without a great deal of oxygen."
funny,3c7qdt,Track607,"A hole. It's not like a 5 ft wide hole.\nHave you ever seen a roof ventilated during a fire? \nIt's very small opening we make yet it provides adequate fuel for the fire to be manipulated in a way we want it to. \n\nNo blow like 5 stories open, on a building with a mostly glass exterior.\n\nIf it's never been photographed i guess it doesn't exist....well then the wreckage of a certain Malaysian plane doesn't exist. If you haven't noticed the video i linked was a fire contained to mostly one side, on a building that was vastly different than the construction of sky scraper. However note the collapse still remained relatively contained to a direct downward motion. \n\nLastly contents....are we seriously going to argue this? I'm a firefighter, a HAZMAT tech and literally live and breath this shit on a daily basis....content fires burn fuckin hot.....that or everytime i've TICed the ceiling an active structure fire the TIC has lied."
funny,3c7qdt,Ephraim325,"A hole. It's not like a 5 ft wide hole. \n\n\nIt's the equivalent of a 5 foot-wide hole in a regular building, as clearly these are skyscrapers.\n\n\nIf it's never been photographed i guess it doesn't exist....well then the wreckage of a certain Malaysian plane doesn't exist.\n\n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt on this obvious strawman/red herring.\nI said photographed or written about.\nThe lack of photo evidence would explained by the historical record, scientific enquiry, etc.\n\n\nIf you haven't noticed the video i linked was a fire contained to mostly one side.\n\n\nYeah, but so was WTC1 and WTC2. The planes didn't cut the buildings in half - it crashed into one of the sides, respectively.\n\n\non a building that was vastly different than the construction of sky scraper.\n\n\nIt's a steel-framed building. How much more similar does it have to be?\nAnd if it's 'vastly different', why link to it?\n\n\nHowever note the collapse still remained relatively contained to a direct downward motion.\n\n\nAs far as I can see, this is the result of equal damage throughout all the floors. Definitely not the same scenario as any of the buildings on 9/11. Though, either way, if the floors that did collapse tried to cause the rest of the building to collapse, it would have been a lot slower.\n\n\nLastly contents....are we seriously going to argue this?\n\n\nNot making the best case for yourself by refusing to argue something you claim to do for a living.. but I am not one to judge."
funny,3c7qdt,Track607,"And here we go with the normal i can name arguments and logical fallacy....everytime i try and talk about stuff with you conspiracy theorists....\n\nOne. \n\nYou clearly have zero understanding of ventilation at all. If you are concerned that a 5+ floor hole and countless other windowless stories is not capable of providing adequate air for a fire, then i honestly don't know what to tell ya. It's not like there was a shortage of air there by a long shot. It's also not like the fire was in a completely enclosed structure and throughout the entire structure....\n\nTwo \n\nI literally gave you a steel supported building fire that caused a collapse, i told you where you could look up other reports on structural collapses involving steel structures. Not sure what more you want. Seems relatively well documented.\n\nThree \n\nIf you haven't noticed the buildings had the planes impact one side and you can clearly see an explosion out the other\n\nFour\n\nJust having a steel frame doesn't make a building the same as a 100+ story skyscraper.

funny,3c8pea,Wogachino,"Here's his advice on Milfs.\n\nBut if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:\n\n\nBecause as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.\nBecause when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.\nBecause there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.\nBecause thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.\nBecause in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.\nBecause the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.\nBecause the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.\n\n\n8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!\n\nThus much for my Paradox. But still I advise you to marry directly; being sincerely Your affectionate Friend."

He famously said he did not care what a woman looked like, only that she was DTF (""at night all cats are grey""), would sit around his parlor nude and didn't care who walked in on him (male or female), and had at least one acknowledged illegitimate son and  probably many others on the DL.\n\nBen Franklin would likely not have been interested in doing rails off of a hooker's ass, but he DEFINITELY would have been into doing the hooker's ass."

funny,3c8si1,Bit_Blitter,"When you see something that's too small (i.e. too far away in nature), your brain starts to automatically ""imagine"" reasonable objects based on context. It feels clearer in the small thumbnail because you're imagining certain parts of the details when the information is processed in your brain, but the visual information you're receiving is actually the same (or lesser). \n\nThis can sometimes create certain ""jumps"" in perception when your brain switches from one logical perception to another, perhaps after receiving slightly more information.\n\n""that's no moon""\n\nEdit: from a scientific article (2007), behind academic paywall. A figure shows a heavily blurred image of two objects on a street.\n\n\nFigure 2. The strength of context. The visual system makes assumptions regarding object identities according to their size and location in the scene. In this picture, observers describe the scene as containing a car and pedestrian in the street. However, the pedestrian is in fact the same shape as the car, except for a 90° rotation. The atypicality of this orientation for a car within the context defined by the street scene causes the car to be recognized as a pedestrian.\n\n\nBasically, your brain does a lot of the analyzing work for you before you perceive something, and sometimes it's wrong."

funny,3c8si1,plipyplop,"Basically, your brain does a lot of the analyzing work for you before you perceive something, and sometimes it's wrong.\n\n\nIt does a lot of matching as you perceive something. Analysis, while adhering to result, wrongfully implies deconstruction as a way to get such result.\n\nWhat happens is somewhat similar to the way lightning seeks path to the ground. Incoming signal activates different groups of neurons and pathways, each trained for different patterns. Eventually, when certain threshold is achieved, the signal starts propagating to other parts of the brain, eventually triggering recognition. If said signal activates multiple pathways, you get conflicting activations, which leads to jumps you describe our even illusions that require effort to see different things in the same picture (e.g. woman figurine rotating right or left depending on your disposition)\n\nFeedback from other parts of the brain or even from our perpetually lagging consciousness can strengthen our weaken recognition. E.g. arachnophobic person with weak eyesight will have a hard time trying to unsee a spider in what they know to be a dust ball.\n\nSource: layman fascinated by brain and its working. I'm quite sure my analogies are dated, but hopefully not enough to be utterly misleading.\n\nPS: Apologies for nitpicking. I constantly see people thinking brain actually does analyse things as it's modus operandi. Hell, I thought so too thanks to specialists using word ""analyze"" for its convenience."

funny,3c8si1,Vallarta21,Suddenly the Americans care about soccer again.
funny,3c8si1,dbl_dbl,Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time.\n\n\nhttp://turtletrader.com/patton/
funny,3c8si1,Philbert_1,Muricans don't usually care about anything internationally. But if an American team is involved then the citizens will follow and support.
funny,3c8si1,Saber_Na,"We care once every couple years, during world cups and the olympics.    Pro soccer won't really take off in a big way for probably another 15 or 20 years when a generation that grew up playing it has their own kids and will be interested in watching it on television with them."
funny,3c8si1,factoid_,"One of the nicknames of my towns is ""Soccertown USA.""  It was mostly Irish and Scottish in its origins, and so soccer was therefore the standard sport I guess you can say.  Those Irish and Scottish roots gave way to waves of latin Americans.  These latin Americans love soccer as well. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that as the hispanic population increases and we continue to see immigration patterns like that, the support for soccer will continue increasing.\n\nCouple that with the fact that the US men's national team always does fairly well in the world cup (which garners major support), the US Women always perform at top level which continues to garner support (I've never heard anything about the women's world cup on the scale of this year where it was common conversation everywhere from workplaces, schools, etc).\n\nAdd to that the fact that the MLS continues to bring big names as it has with Beckham, Henry, David Villa, etc.  You're going to continue to see a rise in the popularity of soccer.\n\nWill it reach NFL levels soon?  Probably not.  But you already see new stadiums be built, the stadiums fill up pretty well, and this trend can only continue to go up.  I see more and more people opt out of supporting Baseball, where most people I know ""flip between channels just to check the score"" and it's not unrealistic to think that in less than 15-20 years soccer will be a big thing in the US."

funny,3c97zu,lellswo,"Almost? It made total sense to me. In order to have sex with 100 men in an orgy, you would probably need some LSD to keep the excitement going. But at what cost? In your hallucinogenic state, outward appearance is probably not going to be your highest priority. So, beauty dies. \n\nHave I been ruined by reddit?"
funny,3c97zu,HappySoda,Or beautiful woman is drugged and gangbanged by 100 men.\n\nShe dies.
funny,3c97zu,hurdur1,"Or maybe she was a regular looking woman, but her name was beauty"

funny,3c97zu,TheTjums,"Or maybe she started off beautiful, but after LSD and being gangbanged by 100 men she was a total mess."
funny,3c97zu,cwood1973,This kills the woman
funny,3c97zu,PooPooKazew,"Haha I didn't read it as a news headline at first, but that makes perfect sense now"
funny,3c97zu,Kindness4Weakness,"It reads like a headline. Like below it you'd read:\n\n""Beast unavailable for comment, but sources close to the family say he's devastated, and has locked himself in the highest tower of the castle."""
funny,3c97zu,Morningxafter,Not just any beautiful woman - this is specifically the heroine from Beauty and the Beast. This is the plot synopsis for the sequel.

funny,3c97zu,aglaser,I like this interpretation the best
funny,3c97zu,MaxHannibal,studies prove that 99 out of 100 enjoy gang rape.
funny,3c97zu,Hayabusasteve,"I think it's simpler than that. If you go to an LSD orgy and have sex with 100 men, even consensually you are likely to be very depressed after this. So depressed that you are unable to see beauty in the world around you (at least for a time). Beauty will be dead for you."

funny,3c97zu,Br0ski,"I was thinking a little more simplistically. A woman that's on LSD and getting fucked by 100 guys is definitely going to lose her beauty by the end of it. I mean, all those dicks have to go somewhere. She's not taking them all in the same orifice, that's for sure."
funny,3c97zu,RavenPanther,That was my take.

funny,3c97zu,OppaiOppaiOppai,I'm guessing that's not really NSFW unless you understand the squigglies.
funny,3c97zu,Jused,hehe. Put up NSFW cause the image is from Japanese Adult Video (JAV) Cover. The back cover is definitely NSFW
funny,3c97zu,OppaiOppaiOppai,"I can't say that I've ever had a trip that's made me absurdly promiscuous or with any extreme visuals that have detracted or masked the natural beauty of someone. Maybe some people have weird trips, but a 100 person orgy makes more sense with a stimulant high (dopaminergic) than a specific type of serotonergic high ala L or mushrooms. If anything, most people become more inwardly curious and less physically active on any appreciable dose of psych's."
funny,3c97zu,Neurolectric,"Once you add in the singing and dancing, a 100 man orgy doesn't really take that much time. The real problem lies in explaining to the dwarves and wood elves that technically they don't qualify as men but the Beast does because he's a man under a magical enchantment."
funny,3c97zu,Rohri_Calhoun,Or you could think of it like Beauty from Beauty & the Beast. After Beast dies she goes through this whole drug experimenting phase and that leads to wild LSD Orgies where she dies in a pool of her own vomit after 15 hours of wild orgy sex
funny,3c97zu,The_CrookedMan,This. It reads like a headline.
funny,3c97zu,Thread_Kaczynski,"it is an actual newspaper headline from the 60's, copied out on a tshirt."
funny,3c97zu,epochellipse,"More, after she's had an orgy with 100 men on LSD, she is no longer a beauty but a whore."
funny,3c97zu,Steel50,It could actually be a headline. A quick google brings up nothing but I'm no search ninja. I wonder if there was some gorgeous woman who died after too much sex during an acid-party?
funny,3c97zu,Jarkus86,"I once saw a video probably from efukt where 3 women were trying to break the world record in most sexual partners in a certain interval. Number 1 and 2 was really close, the winner is excited but the loser breaks down completely. Quite funny."

If /r/fatpeoplehate had not started harassing users in other subreddits (such as /r/keto) they would probably still be around today. Finally I believe it's naive to think that reddit could possibly ban all the hateful subreddits here, but also naive to think they aren't still actively monitoring for the type of behaviour that got /r/fatpeoplehate banned and continuing to enforce their new anti-harassment policies"

funny,3c8ztm,euphemism5,And myself and many others have switched most of our online time over to Voat because of Ellen Pao... so how is that working out for them?  The Reddit stockholders apparently didn't learn from Digg.
funny,3c8ztm,lbmouse,I hear it is amateur hour over there. I tried unsuccessfully a dozen times to get on today. That org is not up to the task. My memory of the Digg problem is that it came from groups of heavy users organizing to game the system. When people realized that the fix was in and they did not have a chance to accumulate Karma or whatever they call it over there they left. It was more of a community problem than a top down problem. \n\nI wonder why people are getting so upset in this matter. The corporation that owns this site fired one of their employees. No one knows why. But people are opposed to the firing. Has this Victoria person ever revealed why she was fired? I have seen many of my coworkers fired over the years and nearly all of them clearly need to be fired. In most cases their coworkers would have pulled the plug on them before the official process played out. Don't any of the people in the lynchmob remember one coworker that is an ass or isn't pulling their weight? Why pick one side over the other. Without knowing the facts.

He's a classic fucking tool that can't be comfortable with himself unless everyone around him compliments him.

funny,3c96aj,Hot_Fist,Or maybe it's Maybelline
funny,3c96aj,J_ology,people have no disregard for drug addicts... they are not human anymore because their brain is fucked on meth? She probably tried it once at a party with her idiot friends and is now serving life in hell with no way out. And you all just laugh and call her crap.\nfuck you
funny,3c96aj,Quorke,What bullshit. She chose meth many many times before she was truly addicted.
funny,3c96aj,General_Specific,"physical addiction is one thing, mental addiction is a whole other thing. You take something that makes everything feel wonderful, for a person who in her youth probably feels like shit mostly. Of course shes going to choose that many times."
funny,3c96aj,Quorke,"I agree. I just disagree with the concept of ""tried once, now addicted"".  It is way more complex than that.  You can apply your reasoning to anything including alcohol. People who feel mostly shitty try alcohol and get ""keyed in"" and start chasing it. Alcoholism follows gradually over the course of many decisions. I imagine it is the same for something like meth except accelerated. \n\nIf you use the shitty life example, then she was potentially addicted before she even tried it."
funny,3c96aj,General_Specific,"True. But I've made mistakes, we all have. I used to be addicted to meth. Hell I've been addicted to a cocktail of drugs before (I'm better now before you ask). What happens is you try it a couple of times. It's fun! But the more you choose it, the more it consumes you. It starts choosing you. Do you wake up in the morning and i midiatly wonder how you're going to get money for drugs, BEFORE you eat breakfast? No, probably not. I have. Trust me, after you choose it for a while, it starts to become a definitive thing, not a choice."

funny,3c844v,Atlasus,"Hopefully they'll get out of the EU, bring back the Drachma (or some other currency), make it dirt cheap to go there and get some sort of tourism businesses going again. That's the only way Greece to create jobs for the people that live there!"
funny,3c844v,itchytooth_,"Go back to the drachma? And base the value in what? It's crippled economy, inability to pay it's debt, and sky high unemployment? That will be great, let's work on an ad slogan for when they do that:\n\n""Come for our post apocalyptic roving gangs, stay because we can't afford to fly our planes""\n\nTourism will become their only major industry, they will be like any other depressed eastern european countrt. The truth of the matter is, when they were sticking to the IMF recommendations, they were doing better."
funny,3c844v,what_comes_after_q,"Actually the instant devaluation of the drachma would be a good thing in the long run. The first few years will be way worse than the situation right now or what the austerity package proposed, but if they play it right it has a good chance to work out (Greece does have some exports and the hyperinflated currency can make those more competitive).\n\nProblem is, what is their track record of getting things right, especially in a situation that requires years, if not decades, of very careful economic and financial maneuvering. Just as an example, they failed to collect on 89% of taxes in 2010.\n\nOn the other hand, austerity was never really the right course - austerity never works out in a depressed economy. The ideal situation would have been for Greece to let their currency devalue, but they couldn't do that since they are on the Euro.\n\nTL;DR Game is hard."
funny,3c844v,np-tryhard,"Austerity is being used in order to keep Greece in the eurozone, which has never been done so it's not really comparable. also not sure what you mean by not working on depressed economies. Usually it makes things less bad than it would be otherwise.\n\nAlso not sure how dropping the euro would help with organizing the government and in collecting taxes.\n\nGreece really doesn't have much in the way of exports. Bolgaria also has exports, but isn't a booming economy either. Greece wants to go back to how things were before the debt crisis, but those days are long gone."
funny,3c844v,what_comes_after_q,Implementing reforms and sticking with the Euro would also be good in the long run - pain has to be met on one way or another. One is cheaper and easier route of the two - I am sure you can figure which.
funny,3c844v,Stoic_Statesman,"I am sure there are other ways to prosper than ""sticking to the IMF recommendations"".\n\nGreece invented Democracy. I would not be suprise to see them coming with a disruptive and ethic solution."
funny,3c844v,Sb00b,Like blame someone else?
funny,3c844v,monahx,This isn't really rocket science. They are spending way more than they are making. They lied for years about this in their financial reports. Cutting back on spending is the only solution. This is ethical.
funny,3c844v,what_comes_after_q,"Import prices would sky rocket, and the Greeks need to import lots of food or there will be starvation and riots, or worse. Life is going to suck for the next decade, but it can be the sort of suck where you grumble and save every penny, or the kind of suck where civil war sends them back to the dark age."
funny,3c844v,Brahmaviharas,"You know, we have plenty of vegetable/fruit/meat farms here too... it's not like we import everything."
funny,3c844v,fastgr,Yes but those farms aren't enough to feed all of your people. You import more than you export.
funny,3c844v,Brahmaviharas,"Only because it was cheaper, if we need to we have plenty of good land to plant more."
funny,3c844v,fastgr,"But your agricultural programs are heavily subsidized by the EU. Without that money coming in it will be much more expensive and difficult to do large scale crops, especially on land that hasn't been farmed before. I'm sorry to say that food will be more expensive no matter what."
funny,3c844v,Brahmaviharas,"Its not like they dont have an economy and tourism buisness, but they refused to collect taxes over the last generations and bleed the nation dry. On top the government employees took it to the extrem with big bonuses (like 200.000€ a year for the easiest jobs (10h a week) and the hole familie had poisitions like this. Almost 1/10 of greece were working for the nation like this."
funny,3c844v,Atlasus,"Global politics/economics is not my thing, so can someone tell me why Greece sucks with money?"
funny,3c844v,SmilinDominator,"Corruption on a scale entirely unimaginable to us, together with being unconcerned for the situation of future generations."
funny,3c844v,squngy,"It was a mixture of government corruption and incompetence. One interesting point is that they took a derivatives contract with Goldman Sachs at a historical (much lower than the market) exchange rate. By doing this, they presented themselves as having lower debt so they could borrow more. It was disguised as an exchange rather than a credit. It seems incredibly dodgy especially since Goldman Sachs recorded a profit of $600M in 2012 over this deal and the Greek government paid higher trade fees than the norm for large private contracts. However, the Eurostat doesn't have comprehensive recording rules for financial derivatives so it's not technically illegal."
funny,3c844v,How_Mathematical,"Incredibly generous social entitlement programs funded with loans, and the assumption of receiving more loans in future to pay off the old ones. Today is the future and the IMF and other creditors checked the books and balked.\n\nGreece also has trouble with systemic corruption that would put Chicago and Detroit to shame, as well as a lack of valuable exports or particularly skilled labor."
funny,3c844v,fidgetsatbonfire,Don't see a way out of this for Greece.  They won't willingly assume austere measures so now they are going to fall upon austerity squared.
funny,3c844v,BushPilotBob,"Actually, strict austerity measures were implemented in 2012 on the recommendation of the IMF, which has resulted in rising unemployment in Greece and a large reduction in their overall GDP. Austerity is not the way to go to promote economic growth and they will need growth to pay back their debts. \n\nThey'd be better off negotiating the loan repayments over a longer period of time with modest repayments and implementing structural reforms in how they collect and distribute tax revenue. The Greek debt is already unsustainable. The IMF really should have cut the debt value down in 2010 instead of keeping up the farce that Greece could pay it all back and continuing to lend on that premise. \n\nHindsight is 20/20. Continuing with contractionary fiscal and monetary policy will only result in a much longer recovery period for Greece."

funny,3c8u1z,_stonecoldsaidso,"Not really. Japan was a signatory to the Geneva Conventions mandating humane treatment of civilians, wounded, and prisoners of war. Prior to their second invasion of China in 1937 (which resulted in the Rape of Nanking, genocides of ethnic minorities, human experimentation, and the death of up to twenty million civilians), Japan was also party to the League of Nations, which explicitly denounced the use of wars of aggression to resolve political disputes.\n\nVirtually all the war crime convictions of Japanese leaders were grounded by their violations of treaties that Japan had ratified prior to the wars. In contrast to Nazi war criminal suspects, Japanese leaders like Hideki Tojo fully accepted the legitimacy of the courts and their sentences, as Tojo stated:\n\n\nIt is natural that I should bear entire responsibility for the war in general, and, needless to say, I am prepared to do so. Consequently, now that the war has been lost, it is presumably necessary that I be judged so that the circumstances of the time can be clarified and the future peace of the world be assured. Therefore, with respect to my trial, it is my intention to speak frankly, according to my recollection, even though when the vanquished stands before the victor, who has over him the power of life and death, he may be apt to toady and flatter. I mean to pay considerable attention to this in my actions, and say to the end that what is true is true and what is false is false. To shade one's words in flattery to the point of untruthfulness would falsify the trial and do incalculable harm to the nation, and great care must be taken to avoid this"

funny,3c8u1z,fuckevrythngabouthat,"Well to be quite honest whether the cities were military hubs or not more civilians died than anyone. To justify the all the deaths those bombs caused on historical speculation is just not good enough. I'd like to believe if the right people were in charge we could have ended the war without nuclear devastation or another mainland invasion. War is a very stupid thing and to justify all the Japanese that died with ""Americans who could have died"" is a very close minded look at what was really just the easy way out. If that same ""mercy"" tactic was used today it would only cause global thermonuclear fucking war. This is my opinion"
funny,3c8u1z,airiu,"So, here's the deal...\n\nNo. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilian cities and the second bomb wasn't needed since Japan would have capitulated a bit after the first. The second was payback for Pearl Harbor. \n\nBut, I've read somewhere that the Japanese prepared biochemical weapons and parasites to attack the US with which would have also killed many innocent people. So, history might have been completely different if not thanks to the bombs. \n\nHistory is history though. No need to dwell upon it. \n\nEDIT: I based my comment off of knowledge I acquired while studying in Europe. Take it with a grain of salt, since it may be different from what Americans are taught in schools.\n\nEdit 2: I now have time to explain. \n\n3 days to surrender was unrealistic. It was the Americans who decided that negotiations were off the table, which is unreasonable.\n\nIn two weeks max. Japan would have capitulated the war and the Americans knew it. \n\nTake it this way, would it be reasonable to give up on your democracy in 3 days if you were on the losing side? Would you even be able to? No. \n\nThe Japanese Emperor Hirohito had a position to uphold and hence could also not give in to the American's idea of him resigning. It is more complex than it seems. You can not just change your political structure on a whim."

The Japanese themselves killed waaaay more innocent people. The Soviets raped and murdered millions of people. More innocent Germans were killed in British firebombings of German cities than the number of Japanese killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n\nContext, bitch, context. You can't fault the US for using nukes. I doubt that any other country, if they had nukes in WWII, would have used them with less restraint than the US did."
funny,3c8u1z,MightierThanThou,"That tends to be an American's view of what the Japanese think of it. However, Japan teaches it very differently, and consider the bombs a sad but good thing. The leaders were not going to surrender. The war was lost, the troops were dead, but they wouldn't surrender. If we hadn't dropped the bombs, many more innocent civilians would have died. The war was turning into a personal genocide of Japan's own people. Untrained, I'll prepared civilians were being shoved out the door with a gun and a helmet to fight. And it's unlikely it would have ended until Japan was nearly out of people. It's very much an atrocity, but what Japan did to the Chinese and its own people was worse, and want about to end as many people believe. The truth is a sad double edged sword.

funny,3c8u1z,tehbored,Then they shouldn't have bombed pearl harbor.  Everyone knows that America does everything big. Go big or go home.
funny,3c8u1z,3cko,"I know Lloyd scored two goals in the first five minutes of the game, but I wouldn't call them ""nuclear bombs"" that killed anyone..."
funny,3c8u1z,are_you_trolling,Also it helped keep the Russians out of the war. If it had dragged on you know the Russians would have started marching that way.
funny,3c8u1z,fptp01,"You're a dirty fucking piece of shit you know that? I'm tired of all you fucking scums acting like the USA is just a shithole for doing the things it did, do you want to get flown into a sky scraper full of people? Then Don't bitch the U.S. Went and made the Taliban extinct, do you want the japs to do the same? Then don't get pissy they got vaporized you fucking piece of dumb shit trash, you bet your degenerate ass it was justified."
funny,3c8u1z,SuperBennern,"When did I ever say USA is a shithole? You are a great example of why people consider Americans ignorant, you think if you hadn't taken the Japanese that the rest of the world would just turn over and die?\nAnd how did Taliban start? As a rebelion group against the Soviet, funded by CIA.\nMy point was, that even though if you justify the killings, don't shove it in their face like this picture shows.\nI knew this comment section would be biased, but this is far beyond what i expected.\n\nedit: spelling."
funny,3c8u1z,DrCommonMan,without the US it really did look like the Axis powers were going to be the new primary powers in Europe...so yeah...without the US Europe would be speaking 2 parts German and 1 part Japanese.\n\nIts cool...the good ol' US of A got everything in line...two times...

funny,3c8u1z,naciremathrowaway,"Theres nothing wrong with wearing the hat. Whoever made the hat just lacks good taste, as we have much more memorable moments in our history.\n\nDon't forget, we dropped the atom bombs in the hopes that it would actually result in less casualty. It seems childish to idolize war (as a child it seems mysterious and exciting), and I don't think we're a group of people to brag about war. Besides, most of the people wearing this shit haven't had the crosshairs pointed at them."
funny,3c8u1z,fickleburger,wut
funny,3c8u1z,naciremathrowaway,"I get that many disagree, but I just feel that the hat is distasteful, and that it's a little silly, that's all.\n\nEdit: I realize I may have gone on a tangent. But basically, OP posts a rhetorical question, /u/sf7 suggests theres nothing wrong with the hat, so I posted my opinion on why I didn't like the hat. Am I being downvoted because people disagree with my opinion? Because, I wasn't that off topic."
funny,3c8u1z,Scrotesmcgoats,"I dont agree with you but I think its bullshit you are being downvoted. You are voicing your opinion, you are not trolling and you are adding to the discussion."
funny,3c8u1z,Thesaurii,"There isn't anything inherently wrong with wearing the hat, if you wear it on the Fourth of July or when hanging out with friends, its a joke that most people won't be bothered by. I think its pretty hilarious.\n\nBut wearing it to a match against Japan is fucked up, and the only way you should be wearing it is if your goal is to make a lot of Japanese people feel uncomfortable, angry, and sad."
funny,3c8u1z,naciremathrowaway,"I agree on the second part although I wouldn't go as far as to say it's fucked up, maybe just lack of foresight.\n\nAs for wearing it on the Fourth, sure, go for it, but I feel like it does idolize war a little bit, or at least the wearer does. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions, but then why is it that these tanks are so common at the gym, and now the slogan is on hats. Nobody's manufacturing hats that reference any other part of history. When it comes to remembering historical events for the sake of patriotism, we only seem to reference war.\n\nEdit: and since you pointed out that it might make Japanese people uncomfortable, I feel like it leaves a bad image for us when she wears that."

funny,3c8u1z,Coasteast,Suspicious? Sure. Still an amazing exchange? Yes.
funny,3c8u1z,TMasterson5,"Yeah it's not like the U.S. Had been supplying Britain and Russia with military equipment and manpower including pilots that helped fend off German bombers for years prior to our official entry into the war. And then when we did enter the war we had the largest effect on the war effort of any nations involved despite fighting two different wars on seperate sides of the globe. And no I'm not saying the America single handelly won the war, but without the US's help the Germans would have most likely been victorious in their effort and Europe and the rest of the world would be a totally different place than it is now."

funny,3c7z43,whenautistscollide,Holy shit.\n\nTIL : Im old as fuck.
funny,3c7z43,rainwulf,Remember the copy of sixth sense they watched? it was VHS.
funny,3c7z43,Redd575,OMG.\nWow... just speechless.
funny,3c7z43,rainwulf,"I just finished watching this movie because of this thread, and I thought it was awful."
funny,3c7z43,klsi832,"Yes, it was."
funny,3c7z43,onmyhonor,"Could have been good, the story kind of went off the rails."
funny,3c7z43,bueno_henry,"What story? I made it an hour and a half into this movie and the story hadn't started yet.\n\n\n... trying on his customer's shoes lets him step into their lives.\n\n\nIn the first hour and a half there was never any progression past that point. He didn't appear to be learning anything, he's just trying on shoes and checking out what it's like to be other people.\n\nI just realized this is a very short sketch comedy that isn't funny, and is then repeated until it fills an entire movie."
funny,3c7z43,AsaAyers,"I coincidentally saw it today, and enjoyed it, up until the comic book ending."
funny,3c7z43,himse1f,This movie had so many plot holes though. The story's idea was 10/10 they just didn't execute it well.
funny,3c7z43,TacoLolz,"Havent seen it, but I did think the premise of the story has the potential to be a good movie. A lot of potential if you get it right."
funny,3c7z43,haste75,It was really good.
funny,3c7z43,BrightPhotos,I actually liked this movie. I didn't think it was that bad. I liked the way he played a much more relaxed person
funny,3c7z43,stonesenses,It had 5 stars the other day and I almost considered it.
funny,3c7z43,Homeaux,The rating system in Netflix is based on what you've already watched and rated. So it'l be different for everyone
funny,3c7z43,Homeaux,Been on Netflix for years and just finding this out.
funny,3c7z43,Homeaux,"Yeah, it's not that obvious. I discovered it when I noticed some films that I've seen before had good ratings and I saw them again several months later and the ratings had dropped. It's also why they ask you to rate everything after you've watched it, as it tries to match content more effectively :)"
funny,3c7z43,10GuyIsDrunk,I guess it's good to know that now :)
funny,3c7z43,AlwaysHere202,"Everything you said is true but I feel like you're missing the part that makes it make sense.\n\nThe stars it shows you on movies is what it guesses you'll rate the movie. So if a movie has 4/5 red stars, it thinks if you watch it you'll rate it 4/5.\n\nThe more you watch and the more you rate the more accurate it will be (at least in theory), especially if you go into your history and delete stuff that other people watched on your profile or stuff that you usually would never watch but pressed play just to see what it was."
funny,3c7z43,Homeaux,"It's a pretty good movie.  Best thing Sandler's put out in a long time.\n\nIt's got a slow start, but it comes around."
funny,3c7z43,SkaJamas,"I'll probably give it a watch, thanks partner."
funny,3c7z43,scole8605,i enjoyed the heck out of it. its a good movie and it's still funny.
funny,3c7z43,Edgar-Allans-Hoe,"Looks content to me, but what do I know."
funny,3c7z43,Bobdoleisreal,"Ha, more like The Cobbler starring Adam Sandaler."

funny,3c7z43,fried_eggs_and_ham,Spending your vast fortune can be extremely tiring.
funny,3c7z43,Traunt,I actually just watched The Cobbler a couple of weeks ago and thought it was pretty good precisely because it did not seem like a typical Adam Sandler movie.
funny,3c7z43,SpankingGT,check out Reign Over Me. Sandler would do very well to be in a Bob Dylan biopic.
funny,3c7z43,SinkHoleDeMayo,Isn't he making movies that he can enjoy with his kids? He still makes millions regardless.
funny,3c7z43,Guttermouth11111,Basically. He's just a big kid at heart and his movies are a reflection of that.
funny,3c7z43,HairyDBZ,This was not a child-friendly film...

funny,3c7z43,SgntFlfflz7,"If they keep making movies, then you're not."
funny,3c7z43,Thatomeglekid,"I enjoy them, purely because I don't really put much thought into it. Everyone shit on Grown Ups 2, I thought it was funny, because I didn't take it seriously. Their movies aren't supposed to be taken seriously, and that's why I find them humorous."
funny,3c7z43,SgntFlfflz7,i dont understand why people bash people for liking movies that have stupid jokes and basic plot lines
funny,3c7z43,shadymcdonalds,"Yeah, I don't get it either. It's cheap laughs, but clearly it works, because they're making more money than I ever will."
funny,3c7z43,verendas,Don't lump Buscemi in with them
funny,3c7z43,RinardoEvoris,"his expression just mumbles ""damn i hate these movies i make"""
funny,3c7z43,shadymcdonalds,Is this one part of his Netflix deal or did no one have any interest and it went directly to video/Netflix?
funny,3c7z43,WinstonZeb,"It was in theaters, just not very long"
funny,3c7z43,badmic95,Just finished it. The concept was actually pretty neat! I enjoyed it.
funny,3c7z43,CloudPooper,"It's nice to see that both Netflix thumbnails are just of Adam Sandler looking tired with stubble and a coffee. I bet his character an just see the little things in life that no one else can, and that's how he holds up against the one dimensional villain."
funny,3c7z43,zerosanity,"Now he must restart his career, as a Drama actor, and redo the same amount of movies he has done as terrible movies as reworked dramas. My mercy upon him."
funny,3c7z43,soul_cat,Adam Sandler yet again providing another family friendly movie that is not made to only appeal to young children. Coming soon to generic daytime holiday television time slot near you.
funny,3c7z43,shitterplug,"Despite how you feel, he doesn't lose money on his movies."
funny,3c7z43,SwampDonkey420,"Well, his budgets are usually pretty low. He also has a pretty good sized cult following who think he's absolutely hilarious."
funny,3c7z43,Traunt,"I liked this one, give it a chance."
funny,3c7z43,GroovingPict,"I actually want to watch this since it doesn't seem like a crummy comedy movie. I absolutely loved him in Reign Over Me, so I'll check this out this week."
funny,3c7z43,ezrubie7,"But he's the nicest famous guy Tom Wilson (Biff Tannen) knows, so he's got that going for him."
funny,3c7z43,shitterplug,Saw him in Orlando and he got really excited when I asked him about Freaks and Geeks. He's super nice.
funny,3c7z43,BattletardBlacknigga,"Adam Sandler has totally stopping giving a fuck. He's making these crappy movies with the sole purpose of getting a paycheck. Some actors want to diversify their roles, some want to try for awards, some want to direct. Not Adam Sandler. He wants to hammer out a crappy move in a tropical place so he can simultaneously vacation. He's become incredibly efficient."
funny,3c7z43,Loupy_lvl,"Honestly, Adam Sandler should not be allowed near a film studio ever again."
funny,3c7z43,EnduraMan,"...or a TV studio either...nothing so sad as someone who thinks they're funny, and they're not...just annoying."

Unless you go to a more conservative city like Konya you won't have any problems. Seriously though don't go east during Ramadan, all restaurants are closed until nightfall, you can't get alcohol and you might get beaten up on the street for smoking a cigarette."
funny,3c78xa,ihatemyliver,"never been to a muslim country so I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I bet smoking or eating in front of others during the day during Ramadan is probably a dick move anyway"
funny,3c78xa,bigstevenet,"It is a bit douchy, yes. I take care to not eat in front of others, and pretty much everyone I know deos too, but there shouldn't be a requirement for it since it is a secular country with relgious freedom(to some extent), it's just polite. It makes eating out pretty awkward, since you don't know where the waiters might be fasting. Luckily the restaurants near where I work I don't run into this problem, but I live in the capital and its not a big problem here. \n\nThat being said, fasting people do need to be careful to some extent IMO. Hours of dehydration and hunger does give you quite a horrible breath."
funny,3c78xa,ihatemyliver,"Oh man, I have been around a few. In fact, the halitosis-ness results from the misconception that they cannot brush their teeth (as one might ingest the water, thereby nullifying the fast), where in fact they SHOULD be brushing their teeth as traditionally they would use something called a ""Meswak"" which has antibacterial properties, which nowadays can be substituted for a toothbrush. Also if you pray five times a day, you're actually rinsing your mouth at regular intervals so that should alleviate some of the bad breathness due to dehydration and saliva buildup."

Sabotage is the only way to bring meaningful change to the labor market.  Sabotage is the only thing that has worked.  Sabotage is such an effective means for bringing about labor reform that the word sabotage itself was used to describe the tactics employed by protesting factory workers.  They would throw their shoes or sabots in machines.  \n\nCirculating mix tapes at some low wage job is a good idea.  I think they would make more money planning pranks.  Fuck these slave drivers.

funny,3c9a1g,upside_downsyndrome,"It's surprising how 'uninternational' Japan is. They think they are because they have Apple stores and McDonalds, but pretty much nobody over there can speak English. Even the younger generation. Even some of the English teachers I met, I struggled to understand.\nYet it's easy to find English speakers from Philippines, Thailand, Korea, Vietnam, even a lot from China. All across the middle-east and Africa, through South America.\n\nI attended a Japanese language school in Osaka for a while, and it was full of Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese people. All the younger students knew enough English to have a decent conversation. None of the Japanese tutors knew a word of it, even those in mid-20's.\n\nMy wife's cousin is in her early 20's there, and has just graduated from an 'international' university, which has a lot of focus on English, and you cannot have a conversation with her either. She picks up on a lot of things, but I had to practice being an airport immigration clerk with her before she went to Thailand, just so she could confidently say she's a tourist.\n\nThe average Japanese person is lovely, usually very interested in you and to some extent, international news. But compared to pretty much every other person I've encountered, from different parts of Asia, even much poorer places, they seem to be very closed off and falling behind.\n\nThe McLaren-Honda partnership that's going shittingly seems to, at least initially, have had a lot of communication problems. As other Asia countries develop, open up, and integrate more, I can see people not wanting to do business with Japan, in favour of going elsewhere. That plus the declining birthrate seems to spell trouble for them. I think that place needs a bit of a cultural revolution in regards its attitude to immigration and the rest of the world. At the moment it seems like a great place to be an old person that likes things just they way they've always been.\n\nBut it's also an amazing place to live, providing you have money or don't mind work. It's clean and incredibly safe. But that's probably because it's like 99.9% Japanese only there."

funny,3cak0q,Sloth_Reborn,In the cases of the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution. Religion did not keep the poor from murdering the rich.
funny,3cak0q,KrasnyRed5,"Well the bolchevik were atheist, and the  French well were starving to death plus the French revolution was made by the rich the bourgeoisie , marra danton , robespierre all of them were or lawyer or doctor."
funny,3cak0q,Lucif3,"The Bolsheviks were atheist largely because Marx viewed the Russian Orthodox Church as being integral in subjugating the serfs to the will of the nobility. A very similar idea to the first, second, and third estates that existed in France before the French Revolution."
funny,3cak0q,KrasnyRed5,"Now wealth is the big decider. Back then in Europe titles were equally or even more important. The whole merchant class struggle etc. The fact you were rich didnt automaticly imply you had political influence or a lot of land and titles to your name. So even being rich and succesfull, you still werent part of the ruling class or anything."
funny,3cak0q,Postius,"I would say titles of nobility were more important than wealth at that time. Most societies had little upward movement. If you were born a peasant then you would almost always be a peasant. If you were born a into the nobility you had some ability to influence your life. If you didn't inherit the lands, there was always the military or you could join the church."
funny,3cak0q,KrasnyRed5,I feel like all these sorts of assertions needs some /r/AskHistorians mod to come and delete everything unsourced
funny,3cak0q,Time_for_Stories,"True about titles being more important that wealth.  There have been plenty of poverty stricken nobles throughout history, by which I mean their lands and incomes weren't enough to keep their estates afloat.\n\nIn Britain these sorts of occurrences eventually led to many merchant families marrying into old blood.  It increased their social standing and gave the other family a cash boost."
funny,3cak0q,KapiTod,titles were titles to land which was the basis of all wealth during the feudal era. this is the whole point. the bourgeois era was the era of capitalism which was to replace feudalism.

funny,3cak0q,Yatta79,i wouldn't say they were 'rich' bourgeoisie - definitely bourgeois though. compared to the sans culottes maybe.
funny,3cak0q,PerNihilAdNihil,"I mean that's middle class rich, not 1% rich.  Middle class people don't have any more influence over the world than the poor even today.  Wasn't there something in 1984 (in Goldstein's book) about revolutions needing the middle classes to lead them because the lower classes can't be bothered otherwise?"
funny,3cak0q,bjt23,"Well, I the French Revolution was started by the third estate (the poor) with the aid of a small minority of the second and first (IIRC) Estates. But, it was the higher Estates that drafted the rights of man"
funny,3cak0q,thebla5t,During the French Revolution they actively rejected the Church though.
funny,3cak0q,YourPassportNumber,"In fact they created the first ""Cult of Reason"" churches to make the transition from religion to secularism easier on the devout."
funny,3cak0q,GreenBlueAqua,I would suspect they rejected the Catholic church for the same reason the Bolsheviks rejected the Orthodox church. The feeling that the church was helping to subjugate the third estate in favor of the nobility.
funny,3cak0q,KrasnyRed5,"the peasantry did not reject the church though, this is why the reaction was able to come to power because the peasants of the countryside resented the changes"
funny,3cak0q,PerNihilAdNihil,"The French Revolution was put into motion by doctors, lawyers and philosophers. Some of them were part of the aristocracy. It was way more complicated than saying the poor sons-culotte murdered the rich nobility."
funny,3cak0q,4_out_of_5_people,"well there were different phases through which the french, like all revolutions, had to pass. \n\nthe sans culottes phase was towards the end.\n\nbut yes, kyou're definitely right- people don't seem to realize or remember that there were many so called ""nobles"" who supported change - not necessarily revolution, but they sought to use the poors to pressurize the king for change and the poors saw their chance with teh 'cahirs' and the national assembly, to finally have their say since that body had not convened for over 100 years and was only supposed to raise taxes..."

funny,3cak0q,pixl_graphix,"Consider the following:\n\nReligon is actually a useful tool for control. Both good and bad.  It keeps people in line and helps with morals and shit cause you dont haveto explain yourself. ""Mommy why cant i punch timmy for being a twat?"", ""Cause god will be angry"". Thing is if you mistreat people enough the tool becomes ineffective. Sure i believe peace is awesome, but if you start starving your nation and more and more people live below the poverty line, you either kill them, let them die, or you have a rebellion to deal with. From that point, thats the first sign that your empires dooomed. Even if you crush a rebellion with force, you will just have more. 1 bad leader during 1 rebellion is all it takes to ruin an empire. This is why propoganda is important. If the masses are convinced the rebellion is foolish, pointless or just full of horrible people, then its easier to control. One things for sure though, religon is a tool for keeping people from rebelling, but that does not make it a bad thing. If you are just mad that someones rich thats silly. Its when you have land and resources you should be sharing but are hoarding despite other people nearby needing it, you are setting yourself up for a bad time. Even if not in your lifetime, you could sew the seeds of disaster for your legacy.\n\nBut thats just where my thoughts went.\n\nTldr: yup, you can only keep people in control so much though with religon"
funny,3cak0q,TahaI,"You are also forgetting one other important part of religion. Breeding more people to follow that religion. Back when the world was a much less populated place having plenty of people to work and fight was a very important thing.

funny,3cak0q,Alvaromad,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, you're right. Religion is a political tool, and that's at all levels of society. From the anthropological perspective, organized religion doesn't exist until you have a more stable government and leadership. In most small band and tribe level groups you see little to no religion, and then once you get to larger groups with clear leaders like chiefdoms, then you see religion more clearly defined. And state level? That's when you see the truly powerful religions, and where the religion often has a connection to the government. Look at ancient Egypt. You couldn't rebel against the pharaoh, because that would be reveling against a god."
funny,3cak0q,TahaI,Every single tribe and culture has had religion. It´s a natural thing when it´s night time to look at the stars and think they´re gods in every primitive culture.
funny,3cak0q,Alvaromad,"True, I think he means a properly defined religion. Those start cropping up when societies get bigger and exist for longer. It takes more than ""hey look, the stars are gods thats our religon"" the more people you have to work with the more you have to expand and express the tool. Think of it like a commercial grade oven versus your toaster oven at home. Sure they both cook food but they are not exactly the same either."
funny,3cak0q,CoffeeLovingGamer,I disagree. I think that many cultures and tribes worked to please their gods irrelevant of how big the society was. Hell they´ve found tribes in the amazon during the 1970s with ethical codes to please their gods very similar to Buddhism/christianity.

funny,3cajyv,Sommiel,Luckily there's a sharpener right there.
funny,3cajyv,DryEagle,"That's a steel. It straightens blade, but doesn't sharpen it. Normal use warps the edge and it doesn't cut as well, using the steel straightens that edge once more. Once the edge is actually dull, no amount of using a steel will sharpen it and it will actually need to be sharpened by a grinding tool. \n\nMy guess would be that those knives being held in the wood by the blade will actually dull it quicker than normal use."
funny,3cajyv,Nothing_Impresses_Me,"You're correct, but to be pedantic, it's possible that is a diamond or ceramic steel, in which case it actually can grind and sharpen the blade. /pedant \n\nThat said, it's 99 percent likely it's just a crappy residential grade honing steel and thus could not sharpen a blade."
funny,3cajyv,eucalyptustree,Correct. It's why magnetic knife racks are used in restaurants. Or people put them in back in their knife-rolls.
funny,3cajyv,Oneusee,I just put mine in blade-up so that the weight rests on the knife's spine.
funny,3cajyv,Semantiks,"While term ""sharpen"" is used broadly, a steel will not actually sharpen a DULL blade, it will only ""sharpen"" a blade that needs to be straightened or honed.\n\nMore info: http://www.cookingclarified.com/2012/03/honing-vs-sharpening/"
funny,3cajyv,Nothing_Impresses_Me,"Did you look at the links to that search? They mention sharpening and steel as part of the process. A steel is used after whetstone sharpening to align the edge as part of the sharpening process. It can also be used without sharpening first to align the edge. \n\nThe very FIRST LINK mentions the steels are also called honing rod and that the steel only aligns, it does not sharpen. In fact, look at this very first link in your search:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Teh0Cw84QGQ?t=2m43s"
funny,3cajyv,AbramsLullaby,"I refer to you; every chef I've ever worked with, myself, a google search of ""honing versus sharpening knives"" and some common sense. It's a honing steel, you use a stone to actually sharpen it.\n\nThe steel fixes the edge - straightens and warped parts of the knife. It doesn't actually remove anything, unless you go for a ceramic rod, in which case it'll remove minor amounts of steel in an imperfect fashion. If you care about your knives, you use a stone like anybody that knows their shit. \n\nBut hey, that's okay, ruin your knives with a wooden knife block. Then ""sharpen"" it with a steel. I don't mind. Just don't spout bullshit and give people incorrect ""facts"""
funny,3cajyv,Oneusee,"That's a honer. They pretty much just straighten the edge if the blade, not sharpen."
funny,3cajyv,Hendoe89,A steel refines and takes burrs off the edge. Not really a sharpener.
funny,3cajyv,Sommiel,Why would it be different if the blades were facing upwards?

funny,3c9a6l,forest_ranger,I'd like to actually know if NASA used the metric system when they went to the moon. The military uses the metric system for a lot of systems. I know NASA is basically a branch of the Air Force. It seems logical to me.

funny,3c99b3,LiLa_Be,I know some of these words.
funny,3c99b3,hungry_tiger,It reads like a Cold war era newspaper.\n\nThe Undercover Stunt Junkie Rebellion was violently put down after a power grab by The Peoples' Sledgehammer and Yellow Corn party in Arstotzka's capital today.
funny,3c99b3,alexunderwater,"Ah, see, what we're looking at here is a piece of political commentary.\n\nThe ""sledgehammer"" clearly refers to communism, whereas the ""yellow corn"" - the most prominent crop in the United States - is the symbol of gluttony. Referencing ""more power"" indicates that the reader is meant to consider the struggle between the so-called ""working class"" (or ""proletariat"") and the individuals who keep them eating a grain that other countries think of as being animal feed.\n\nNow, the term ""under-cover stunt-junkies"" would seem to indicate that we're discussing individuals who get an adrenaline high whilst maintaining a sense of anonymity. Someone like that would probably be called a ""superhero"" in our society. However, the absence of hyphens on the shirt doesn't allow this meaning to come through... which, of course, was intended. It's meant to state that a lack of education is keeping these superheros from emerging, and that until the subjugated population learns how to actually think - not just to convince themselves that they're thinking, but actually think - they will remain beneath the heels of their masters.\n\nTL;DR: Absent superheros do not prevent the ongoing tragedy of the working class's slavery beneath the greedy fat-cats."
funny,3c99b3,RamsesThePigeon,"I thought ""sledgehammer"" was a reference to Peter Gabriel and ""yellow corn"" being heroin. While these were coded the rest of the message was able to be clearly stated. The tragedy the is not to be prevented probably was the Iraq war which was supported be the Labor Party that was endorsed by Peter Gabriel at the time."

funny,3c88n1,Calcd_Uncertainty,"/u/sl99 11 points 1 year ago\n\n\n'Flaisch macht Flaisch' is from the old German proverb 'Fleisch macht Fleisch, fisch macht nisch'. It would roughly translate to 'meat gives meat, fish gives nothing', meaning that meat is more nourishing than fish.\nFleisch is in German also connected to 'Fleischeslust', which means carnal desire. The fish can be connected to the catholic tradition of eating fish on friday, or abstinence from eating meat.\nSo in this picture, the proverb is interpretated in a raunchy way. The nun wants to trade the fish that implicates abstinence from meat/lust for the meat that obviously represents carnal desire.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1xzsxf/medieval_wtf_a_monk_exchanges_fish_for_a_penis/"
