Both UNLV and LVAC offer classes, but LVAC has multiple locations, one next to your house and one near downtown/UNLV (on Maryland) so I feel like that may be a better decision. You should probably inquire with LVAC because I think only certain locations offer classes.   On top of that, I was a student at UNLV and barely used the gym because of the driving/parking situation ... I ended up just getting my own gym membership. UNLV parking sucks so you might want to see if the parking situation is any better for members of the gym."

Personally, I think kids do fine on the strip during the day, as long as you are comfortable with them being exposed to some vice.  However, you need to be aware of the nudie card situation.  In some areas at some times there will be small bands of people handing out advertisements for escorts.  These advertisements are the size of a baseball card and include an uncensored picture of the escort.  Additionally the ground in the area is generally littered with additional dropped cards.  As you are walking the strip, be watching ahead for this type of activity and cross the street if you see it.  Other than that, I really think a family can enjoy the sites of the strip without any major concerns."

The kids should love the show you are going to (lots of cool tricks and acrobatics).  The kids will probably spend most of their time in the arcades.  You can also take them to Fremont in the evenings for some free shows (plus check out the aquarium at the Golden Nugget). Unless you need fancy food, try the buffets (Bellagio is pretty good), something unique (dim sum for lunch at Ping Pang Pong), or something cheap (In N Out burger)."
vegas,3e3mxo,Four_Months,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:18 2015 UTC,Easiest is to cab it.  You could talk to a limo at the Taxi/Valet area and see how much a ride would be. I think it would vary from 45-60 dollars one way for an 8 person limo.  All kids love burgers right? Try BLT Burger at the Mirage.
vegas,3e3mxo,VegasGeoff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"The distance from Mandalay Bay to Mirage is a little bit over 2 1/2 miles.  Taxi fare will run you (hang on to your hat) about $15 each way, maybe as low as $14, depending on traffic.    You could take the trams: Mandalay Bay/Excalibur - Monte Carlo/Bellagio and then walk the last 1/2 mile to the Mirage.    The third option (which you might consider anyways if you are in town for more than a day or two) is to get a pass for the monorail,  so you could tram Mandalay Bay/Excalibur, cross the strip, monorail down to Harrahs/LINQ stop and cross the strip back to the Mirage.  You are going to have to balance easiest/fastest of a taxi against the $30+ fare it's gonna cost ya.  The slowest cheapest option is to hoof it.  2.6 miles walking will take you about 40 minutes at a normal pace."

Around the summerlin/henderson area things seem to be doing really well and I see most food and shopping places packed during the expected hours.  Its always seemed like food places do pretty well downtown but social places and places just to buy ""stuff"" don't seem to do as well.  I haven't really hung out at any of the night spots in a long time though so dunno if that was still true, I assumed with all the recent openings of spots that they were doing better."

Carson Kitchen and Eat always seem to be busy. Not sure how Bocho Sushi is doing but VegeNation seems to be steady, Glutton usually looks pretty slow and Zydeco just open a couple weeks ago. ""Itsy Bity Ramen and Whiskey"" opened a couple months ago over in the Ogden. Tried that place when they first opened and was the only customer in the restaurant... but it was also a Sunday afternoon. A new bar/restaurant called ""Therapy"" just open right on E Fremont (next to the now closed Insert Coin) but haven't been there yet. But from looking at their menu they seem to be going for the Carson Kitchen Glutton type of place ... social dishes and a bit on the pricey side so we'll see how long they last!  Container Park is usually pretty busy on the weekends but a little slow during the week. Not sure how all those little boutique shops in there stay open...?

I don't get the container park stores either, I see a few tourists in there on weekends but I wonder about stuff like the raw food place or the anime toy store.  Hope they get business.  I wonder if any of them are thinking of making the move to Downtown Summerlin or Town Square though, I'd guess those have more foot traffic and buys per visitor but maybe downtown is doing a lot better than I think.  Biggest issue for me is location, as a suburbie its a 30 min drive, gotta find and pay for parking usually, and then can't drink too much cuz gotta drive back.  If I was in my 20s I'd love living downtown, but not now.  If they built a few big ol garages and had free parking and regular free shuttles to/from the strip I'd go a lot more often.

There's dozens of examples that have nothing to do with geography.  It has everything to do with people not wanting to spend a ton of money on a losing team.  Last year, the average cost for a family of four to go to an MLB game was $212.  https://www.teammarketing.com/tmr/46   People just won't shell out the cash to watch their team lose 10-3.

Jaywalkers scare the shit out of me - even worse when it's at night and they're wearing dark clothing - but I can understand why they're doing it. Most of the city isn't built for pedestrians, it was built around cars. Crosswalks are infrequent, they're often not placed where they could be very useful & a time saver, and arterial intersections span out quite a bit. When you want to get between Point A to Point B, people will choose their desire path."

Because they left the scene instead, they are now a criminal for that reason and that reason only."

Had she and the driver stayed on the scene for police response, she would've gotten a ticket for jaywalking, and since it resulted in an accident, the fine would have been doubled -- that's about a $400 ticket.   Not trying to bash your girlfriend, but you may want to be more careful in the future and, at least in this case, you need to realize that finding the driver isn't going to solve anything. The worst they face right now is a ticket for leaving the scene of an accident.   Sorry. We have some weird pedestrian / jaywalking laws here."

Here is the main problem though - If they protest the ticket, the cops will turn into big pricks and become a pain in the ass for Walmart (a delivery truck was parked in the fire zone, that kind of thing) You may be able to write the Walmart HQ and they will actually send you a letter of protest - as I've seen this happen before to a guy with a big camper during the Vegas races last year. Walmart's official position is that the police are not to enforce parking policies on their property and encourage campers and long distance travelers to use their store lots."

vegas,3dw536,LeftoverBun,3,Tue Jul 21 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"The part i'm confused about is (as I understand it) walmart lets you park large and oversized vehicles in the back half of it's lots.  It's a known thing.  Truckers use them to sleep, people towing boats or RV's or whatever park in the back half all the time. I would fight this."
vegas,3dw536,Understated_Crazy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"The RV/camper overnight parking policy is up to the discretion of that particular Walmart's management.  For areas that are deemed ""tourist locations"" or urban areas where parking is a premium, that Walmart has the right to deny RVs and large vehicles to park overnight.  You need to check with the manager at the Walmart you plan on staying at to make sure it's ok, particularly with stores in the popular destination locations."

Sure, a fast food job or retail job may make you some money, but you're not going to be making much. You may be able to do it if you work a job like that and live with a roommate or something.

Most people wont hire someone out of state when they have stacks of applications from people down the street. The other problem is Vegas is very transient.  A lot of people move here thinking it's going to be like the movies or something, then it gets to be 110 degrees out and they move back.  Regardless the reason, people move here and move out like the tides. I have a similar but opposite problem.  I want to move OUT of LV.  Same issue, I try to get a job but no one want to talk with me because they have people who are qualified and already live in state.  My idea for my self was to attempt to set up interviews and take a trip to my new destination for a week or 2.  If I get a job then proceed from there, if not it's back home to try again."

I live up in the NW and there are no tourists to be found anywhere. In Summerlin the only place you'll find them is at the Red Rock Resort, and the ones heading down to Red Rock Canyon. The rest of Vegas, aside from downtown and the strip, is not very compelling for tourists, it's just suburbs and strip malls like every place else."

After careful research my husband and I landed on the Vegas area because of the weather, hardly any bad weather, the close vicinity to other places like California and Arizona and we like to go to shows (comedy and music) so what better place than Vegas.  My only concern was that there might be more people in the Vegas area than in Tampa, but like every one is saying, it's mostly on the strip and not in the suburbs so I don't think we have to worry too much about bumper to bumper traffic when we need to go to the grocery store.  It really sounds like this is the perfect place for us."

Vegas' approx 2 million people are all packed into a valley that is probably 1/4 the size of the Tampa Bay area. There's going to be areas that are more crowded than others, so shop around before deciding on an area to live in. There's definitely congestion points all over town, but it has never seemed as bad as dealing with a commute across the Howard Frankland or the messy I-275/I-4 interchange. Just avoid the Spaghetti Bowl (interchange between US-95 and I-15 in the center of town) during peak hours!"

Books that were once bestsellers or critically acclaimed rarely, if ever have any resale value whatsoever. The used book stores and thrift stores get many copies of the same book, over and over again. There is limited demand for these books, so unless you have something rare or first edition or possibly autographed, those books aren't worth anything. After about 1-2 years after publication, many of these books are available on Amazon used for a penny. I buy from book recyclers that sell the book for a penny and just charge applicable shipping to me.  Your best bet is to offer the books for a .50 to 1.00 in a garage sale setting. You may get lucky and connect with someone who wants a particular book who will give you a quarter or two for it.   I'm in Chicago and many used bookstores here will not pay outright for these books, instead offering .10 a pound by bulk weight. There really is a limited market for books, especially popular ones"
vegas,3dtpjr,scott60561,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:25:03 2015 UTC,You could try to send them in bulk to Amazon and have them sell them individually.

vegas,3dsvbx,simimax,6,Sun Jul 19 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well, whether y'all should spend more time in Vegas or at the Grand Canyon might be swayed depending on how old you are. If you're under 21, spend more time in the Grand Canyon, the stuff you can do in Vegas won't be as exciting until you're a little older. Mind you, there are a ton of awesome things to do here if you're younger, you're just going to miss out on some of the cool ""Vegas"" stuff.  There's a FAQ on the sidebar --> with tons of recommendations for great restaurants! If you want to know about more specific types of food, ask away. Las Vegas is a city full of good food!  California is a huge state with tons of breathtaking views but neither the Grand Canyon nor Las Vegas are located in said state. Vegas is in Nevada and the Grand Canyon is in Arizona.  Wherever you end up, I hope you and your mom have a blast! If you have any more questions or want more specific answers, feel free to ask away."
vegas,3dsvbx,littlebittykittyone,2,Sun Jul 19 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"Well this may sound like a dumb question, but how would we get between the Grand Canyon and Vegas? Do people usually drive by car?   As for food, I'm looking for an upscale resturant that serves food that is... well how do I say it... edible for an average consumer. Nothing fancy like roasted pigeon or monkfish, just regular dishes done extraordinarily. Would prefer ones that do reservations so our spot can be for sure. I was looking at Gordon Ramsay's Steak resturant here: https://www.caesars.com/paris-las-vegas/restaurants/gordon-ramsay-steak#.Vas0WvlVhBd  My mom is a fan of his show and would like to try the food he makes so it would be awesome for her, but don't know if it's actually good or not.  As for the California thing, I say that because we were going to spend some time over there too because we will be visiting family after our Grand Canyon and short stop at Vegas (your suggestion makes a lot of sense about the under 21 part). However any views you can recommend in Nevada, California, or Arizona would be greatly appreciated!"
vegas,3dsvbx,littlebittykittyone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"The last time my parents (they're from GA as well!) came to visit me I took them to Giada de Laurentiis' restaurant per my mom's request. I'd never been and never would have chosen to go there if my mom weren't such a big Giada fan. It was really good. Nothing crazy but definitely delicious and a pretty fancy restaurant with a really cool view of the strip. I've never been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and so I can't tell you personally what I think but it always gets good reviews.  If you're staying in Vegas there are tour buses and helicopter tours that head out to the Grand Canyon daily. The tour buses don't let you stay long enough and the helicopter rides are pretty expensive. If you're flying out here and plan to have a rental car, just drive. Spend a few nights in a hotel there so you can explore to your heart's content and then drive back. The west rim is an expensive tourist trap where everything costs extra to do. It's the closest part but it sucks. Drive a little further and hit the south rim.   If you're going to be in Vegas for a few days, there are a lot of other really cool places to visit, Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire are about 30 minutes and an hour away, respectively and both worth a visit. If you've never been out west, prepare to be completely weirded out by the lack of greenery and the desert landscapes.   There are also a lot of cool museums in Vegas that you might enjoy, the Neon Museum, Pinball Museum, and Mob Museum come to mind."

vegas,3dn072,Greydmiyu,3,Fri Jul 17 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to start a war or anything crazy, but in the ping-pong game of commenting I will point out that:   A Costco store has one large centrally controlled video system and it is reasonable to assume that, due to computer / operator malfunction or error, the whole entire system could conceivably go down for a period of time  (whether it did or not in this one instance, I refuse to speculate) A large, major incident happening in real time, drawing 10-30 cops to a single scene would likely be captured on dozens of individual, independent body cameras, so a ""we lost the data"" excuse would be massively hard to prove to a skeptical public."
vegas,3dn072,Doctor_Pujoles,2,Fri Jul 17 20:51:41 2015 UTC,So? The cops have nothing to do with this. There were 50 eye witnesses. I think you are making a case of corruption where there's no corruption. Basically you are making assumptions that go against all other facts.

vegas,3dn072,Penyl,3,Fri Jul 17 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"Right. And the other cost issue arises from data storage. Video files are large to begin with, just from your own GoPro or whatever. Now imagine trying to store the video from every interaction with the public every street cop has every day during his 10 hour shift. Not sure of the actual number of patrol cops Metro has, but it's around 2,000, so speculate that between three shifts there are 500-700 cops on duty at any given time recording all interactions with the public (per the department's policy).   That's A LOT of video to store, even temporarily if the recorded incident is totally routine and doesn't need to be saved indefinitely due to a pending complaint or further investigation like an injury, use of force or a shooting."

vegas,3dn072,Penyl,0,Fri Jul 17 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately ""get in the way"" often involves being within, say, a country mile and with a clear line of sight.

""I can film whatever I want!"" ""I'm gonna put this shit on YouTube when you fuck up!""

vegas,3dpp9b,semanticantics,2,Sat Jul 18 15:15:17 2015 UTC,Thank you for the feedback! I will be sure to check it out in person.   I'm not overly worried about traffic since I won't be traveling in rush hour. It would be mostly trips to trader joes and the gym.   I was mostly worried about crime spillover from heavily trafficked tourist areas. Wasn't sure if that was a legitimate concern there.
vegas,3dpp9b,midgeporn,4,Sat Jul 18 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you work from home and the two place you're going to visit are a gym and Trader Joe's, look at South Summerlin area. At Flamingo and the 215 is a giant gym (LVAC) and at Desert Inn and the 215 is a brand new Trader Joe's. This part of town has a bit less crime, and will be free from almost all the ""rush hour traffic"" or traffic in general. Tons of other stores around. And since Vegas is so dense, you're still like 30 minutes or less away from anywhere you want to be."
vegas,3dpp9b,semanticantics,3,Sat Jul 18 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"This sub exaggerates that any area that isn't Green Valley/Summerlin/Centennial Hills is crime-infested. Some areas adjacent to the Strip are indeed sketchy, but you'll know them when you see 'em. Others are fine; there are some midcentury 'burbs near downtown/Strip that are beautiful neighborhoods. Just use your common sense, don't leave valuable shit in your car no matter where you are, and get renters' insurance, it's like $10 a month. You'll be fine."
vegas,3dpp9b,ArmoredAvenger,2,Sat Jul 18 17:52:06 2015 UTC,"You could be even closer. Given that the city is so small, most places are considered ""close to the Strip"" unless you live in Henderson or Summerlin, which is new stuff that didn't even exist a few years ago and isn't really Vegas. Sahara and Decatur is a pretty decent spot and within about 30 minutes driving to anywhere in the city proper. Just stay away from Paradise and streets that have a member of the Rat Pack in them."
vegas,3dpp9b,ShortWoman,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"Well, from a traffic standpoint I avoid Decatur whenever possible. On the other hand, at least Trader Joe is right there.  That said, I like the Southwest (Spring Valley) part of town precisely because it is close to everything. A lot of people love Summerlin, but then it's a good solid 20-30 minutes to almost anything that isn't actually in Summerlin.  Vegas is kind of a funny place. You can be driving along and one minute you're seeing million dollar mansions and the next it's $50k shacks. I recommend coming out here and seeing what's going on in person before even thinking about signing a lease."

I moved here from California 2 years ago and just found an apt through craigslist, but when I moved a year ago I used a realtor to find a house.  The realtor process was so much easier because they look and set up everything for you and its free to you (the leasing company has to pay the realtor fees).  Just a suggestion since you will be new to the area, that way you can see a couple parts of town before committing."

Don't wanna start a huge thing over this, but the schools here are absolutely terrible. Literally some of the worst in the country (very high drop out rates, low spending per student, low test scores, etc). Except for a few magnet schools and private schools, the education system here is bad enough to convince me that I would never raise a child here. (You don't even want to know the amount of grade inflation my administration REQUIRES me to do.)  Of course now that I've said that, I'm sure several redditors here will have many stories of turning out just fine after going through our education system (one of my friends who is a product of this school district is currently in med school, in fact), but I just wanted to make you aware of something I consider to be extremely important.

vegas,3dkwiv,wbgraphic,6,Fri Jul 17 05:55:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd just start with the ""schools"" section of ccsd.net and start looking at the schools you're zoned for. There's a section for school accountability reports that will tell you the demographics, standardized test score info, and the school's star rating (out of 5 stars). Then you can start asking around for peoples' personal experiences with the specific schools you're interested in. That's gonna be your biggest help - real feedback from parents/teachers who know the school. But speak to a wide variety of people and people you can trust! NOT SAYING THIS IS ALL PARENTS, but there's a lot of parents that are completely uninvolved with the school and then think the school is doing a horrible or amazing job. Having strong opinions when you really don't know the goings-on of a school really doesn't make sense to me.   There's also a section on that site about magnet schools, for when your child starts thinking about high school.  As for the bad stats, a quick Google search comes up with several news reports about Clark County's ""failing"" report card score and high dropout rates (last I read we went from dead last to third from the last...yaaaay).  I don't mean to sound like a negative nancy. I love my job, I love (most of) the kids, but there's a lot that can go wrong if both the parent and student aren't doing everything they possibly can to get the most out of their education. I truly believe our teachers are doing the best they can with what they've got - underfunded and oversized classes, and ridiculous pressures from administration.  Rant over, I promise!"

Bishop Gorman is a good school for athletics, yes. I know their math classes are appropriately rigorous as well. Before I became a teacher, I used to tutor high school students in math.

NYC has terrible public schools too except the few magnet schools like Stuy High which are absolutely top notch but also incredibly difficult to get into. And for that matter, good private schools or even pre-schools are also very competitive--there are just too many people, including rich people in the city. OTH, the public schools on LI and Westchester (and NJ and CT) suburbs are top notch. A former colleague of mine's son went to school in Nassau County and was taking like 5 AP classes while he was still in 10th grade...  I would assume that there should be some good public schools in the more affluent parts of the Vegas metro area, like Henderson and Summerlin.

I am very moderate with politics but honestly the major cities of Texas especially Dallas and Austin are super liberal. It really doesn't feel like Texas at all outside of the stereotypical ""howdy y'all"" stuff that newcomers, tourists and retailers/bars/restaurants just want to play up for ""culture"".   Honestly, I can't recommend LV enough. But if you have a couple of kids and are in healthcare while your wife is in HR, I have to say Dallas might be a better fit for you.

On one hand that means that all the schools theoretically get the same funding and no small-town schools have to worry about not having enough money to run. On the other hand, it means that the zoning for each individual school can change on a whim. There's a new law that says they will explore splitting the district up, but I really don't see how that will benefit anybody except the high property value areas like Summerlin.

I've learned more this year than I did in the last three years.""    My middle child was in a magnet middle school, and will be attending a magnet high school.  Middle school for her was 6+ hours of homework per night, with at least 10 hours of it on the weekends. By the end of it, she was no longer the kid who loved her education.  Oh, and forget magnet busing. That's gone this coming year.   My youngest child, also a middle school student, brought home numerous ""cut and paste"" assignments last year. Things you would expect to see a 6 year old bring home, such as ""cut out the boxes on this worksheet and paste it into your notebook"" and don't even get me started on the English class taking an entire school year to read Wonder or the sheer volume of errors I see on documents sent home.  Oh, and if your kid misses school? Plan on an auto-call around 6pm, making it completely useless as a tool to track a potentially missing/truant child.  My personal favorite is the uniforms; half the schools do them, half don't, and NO ONE wears the same uniform. It's impossible to have hand-me-downs, and the cost of them is horrific if you're budget conscious. (Buying 2 wardrobes for multiple kids is expensive as fuck.)

Low cost of living.   Some caveats: public transit sucks, so you'll pretty much need a car or your quality of life will be shitty. Also, get a job offer before you move over here if you can. If you want to raise kids here, ensure they get into magnet programs. We have some very nice magnet schools for tech, the arts, etc, but most public schools are famously  shitty unfortunately. Maybe that will change... but I'm not holding my breath. At least UNLV and UNR are pretty decent and quite cheap.  When looking for a place to live, lots of people like the Green Valley area. I live just off the strip, but I've looked at apartments in GVR and they were quite reasonable and had nice surroundings. If you want an apartment around the strip or downtown areas, we have plenty of nice high rises but rents in those start at the low to mid 1000s and go way up from there."

Fast food, sit down diner, groceries? You'll find any of those open at 4am.   Need to buy some underwear? There's a 24 hour Walmart next to you where ever you are.  Housing is WAY more affordable than in Cali. You can rent a house for $700 a month where in Cali, you can't even rent a parking spot for that. You'll need an extra $400 just to rent a studio apartment.   No state tax! Lower sales tax than California, so you not only get more from your paycheck but you spend less when you spend your money.   Gas is cheaper and Las Vegas is relatively small and you can go from one side of the city to the other in less than 30 minutes.   Tons of everything to do on any given day.   Awesome right now if you're a wrestling fan.   Public transportation is actually pretty decent during peak hours.   Plenty of options for day trips that are only a few hours away.   The only thing that really sucks is the weather but it's only really unbearable for about 4 months a year. July and August it's just hot and January and February are really cold.   Also, if you're looking to buy a house. There's a lot of fairly new houses that are pretty much untouched. We were probably the biggest victim of the housing bubble bursting so a lot of houses that were built in the 2000's that may have had only one family live in.   I know for sure that there's houses that were built in the 70's in SF that are no bigger than the one I live in that are going for 6x the price.   The only real downside is the people. Lots of bums, and punk kids and such but pay them no mind and stay out of shitty areas and you'll be fine."
vegas,3dkwiv,mferg02,3,Fri Jul 17 10:06:09 2015 UTC,"If bums and hot weather is all I have to worry about, I'll be okay. That won't change, we're coming from Miami!"

vegas,3dkwiv,jbow808,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"I lived in south Florida before I lived here in Vegas. I like Vegas a lot more, though I do miss the ocean.   I've lived in places that were miserable in the summer my entire life and so I didn't find summer here too shocking. It is what it is. Be prepared to stay inside a lot and miss being outdoors for a few months every year.   The people here are pretty nice and it's really affordable to live here as well."
vegas,3dkwiv,N-Depths,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:27 2015 UTC,"I moved here a month ago and I am loving the hot weather so far, because there is very low humidity.  Every day after lunch, I read by the pool for a couple of hours (in the shade, of course) and absolutely love it."

vegas,3dkwiv,SpikeMcAwesome,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"I moved from LA also, actually exactly on my 28th birthday coincidentally. Me and my wife work for the same company and they opened an office here in Vegas, they gave us a nice relocation package times 2 since we both work there, which was cool. In October it will be 2 years, and no way I don't want to ever move back to LA. At first I missed it and it was tough to leave cause I lived in LA all my life,  but we moved out here because we could never afford a nice house in Vegas. We rented a house at first, we didn't plan on that but it worked to our benefit to see how it is to live in a house, we had a 4 bedroom (we have kids) and paid 1050 in rent... Way better than LA prices of course. Just bought a house in North Vegas (which isn't that bad if you're in a good area) For 200 grand, front and backyard with grass, pool and jacuzzi, 4 bedroom and a loft... Would be at least 400 grand in LA... Its so overpriced. This is my second summer and honestly I can live with the heat since it's dry. I go to LA and I'm sweating my balls off cause no one has ac and its barley 85. Me and my wife love clubbing so Vegas has the best to offer there."
vegas,3dkwiv,spilk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a sweet deal. A 4 bedroom house with a pool in the valley (which is where I would likely live if I went back to LA) would cost at least $750,000 to be honest."
vegas,3dkwiv,MatticusXII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"Yea I lived in the valley before, Chatsworth, woodland Hills, Grenada Hills, all over there. I HATED the valley weather I swear lol. Its funny though cause Vegas is a valley and has Valley weather too like high winds and stuff that I hated but I seem to not mind it that much anymore. Originally I'm from Torrance so I liked that kind if weather, but shit like I said for the price to live out here it's so worth it. Plus I still go to LA like once every 2 months because of family and stuff. It's really not that bad a drive when you do it that often. I usually average between 3 to 4 hours, and whenever you make the trip you're usually not in traffic cause most traffic comes in to Vegas on a Friday and leaves Sunday whereas you are leaving Vegas Friday and returning Sunday. And soooo many friends come to visit you from LA when you stay in Vegas. We always have people over its a lot of fun. And like I said I have kids it's not even like I'm kid less having all this fun. There is a lot of cool stuff to do with our kids out here too."
vegas,3dkwiv,Miketallica83,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I moved here from SW Missouri in 2001.  It's really pretty nice.  We don't see a lot of weather but it happens occasionally.  The only real natural disaster to worry about would be an earthquake.  The economy is starting to pick back up.  Construction will never be what it was but other industries are moving in.  Like the other redditor said about the schools, they are garbage.  They are going through an issue right now where they froze all the CCSD salaries.  There is hope due to the fact that the government just opened education up to parental choice.  You won't get that anywhere else in America.  I can give more details if your interested in that.  We have some of the best hiking and climbing in thw country and are close enough to the ocean for a weekend trip.  The area spreads pretty far and there are really great communities.  Look into living in Henderson. The cost of living is also surprising low for a big city."

Of course I don't have kids so can't comment on schools etc. Hot as hell for two-plus months but otherwise great weather for 9 - 10 months a year. Good luck to you!"
vegas,3dkwiv,SonofSin17,2,Fri Jul 17 07:34:41 2015 UTC,"Newish Vegas resident here... Having visited Sin City a few times prior to actually moving, I was hesitant in wanting to raise a family    here; man I was wrong.  I actually left a higher paying and more stressful job to move here, just so I could have 3 days off a week and be home every night with my kids.  Parks, activities and the public library system are pretty awesome, plus my wife and I pretty much never run out of things to do or new places to eat. Discounts at most venues for locals are pretty awesome. In fact our biggest problem is trying to figure out what to do with all the amazing events that roll into town on a weekly basis.  Housing and utilities are quite affordable. I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house in Centennial Hills and my rent and utilities run about $1350 a month, or about $150 less then what I was paying in my previous location for less house and far cooler weather (Seattle).  Also be aware competition is fierce for affordable rentals in desirable neighborhoods/ school zones with most places being rented within a few days of listing.   Be warned, it's tough getting a job here unless you are in a very specialized field and have connections. I was very fortunate that I acquired a very unique skill set while in the military and the company my friend works for was hiring just as layoffs started hitting the oil and gas industry. When he told me that his organization would bring me on for a higher hourly wage for less hours worked per week, I jumped ship as fast as I could. Working 4-10's is way better than a 10 days on/ 4 days off schedule.  Also no income tax is nice, but 8.1% sales tax rates and higher than average vehicle registration fees take some can take a bite out of any budget.  Like any place else, living in Vegas is what you make it. I met some really awesome people in the short time I've lived here and found some really cool spots that I would never expect to find living in the middle of a desert."

vegas,3dnxxb,fortuitous5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:34 2015 UTC,You made money on a loss rebate?
vegas,3dnxxb,MaxTheDog90210,2,Fri Jul 17 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. If the loss rebate is for $100 then go to the high roller video poker and bet $10 per hand. If you win at all, leave and cash out. If you lose, get your $100 rebate and go to the quarter video poker machines. Since return can be ~95% for video poker, you can expect to walk away with a net loss of $5-10 all told. So you have a chance of hitting something big on 10 hands of $10 video poker, and the downside is a $5-10 dollar loss."
vegas,3dnxxb,karma_withakay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"Loss rebates are usually a good deal.  You get to do some wild gamble and try and hit a good score, and if burn through the whole promo value, you can take the rebate.   The kicker is usually in how the rebates are given.  Usually they're in freeplay, so you end up grinding most of that value back through smaller denomination video poker.  Often the rebates are in chunks, which require future trips to redeem.   Montbleu in Lake Tahoe had a nice sounding loss rebate a couple years ago, but the rebate was delivered in multiple parts on specific weekends in the summer, so I passed on it.    The Riviera ran a $1000 one maybe 3-4 years ago, and I think they got abused on it a bit.   By the time I took a shot at it, most of the high limit slots had stickers saying they didn't qualify for the promotion.  Still, I took a shot on some $5 Wheel of Fortune and walked away up about $500."

I heard that the initial loss can only be from slots, not video poker.  I haven't looked into it in detail since I most likely don't qualify -- I got a players club card from them a year ago, before this promotion.

vegas,3dnqsg,Penyl,3,Fri Jul 17 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"I live at Savannah in a 2-bedroom, have for 2+ years.  I like the apartments a lot.  Above average quality inside, well-maintained grounds, office staff is really nice.  We have an attached garage.  It's very quiet although there's a school adjacent which means traffic for a half hour in the morning and afternoon and playground noise sporadically throughout weekdays (which shouldn't matter if you're not home at those times or have an apartment on another side of the property).  Utilities are not included.  It's pet friendly, there's a dog walk and pickup bag dispensers throughout the grounds (although some people don't pick up after their dogs).  We had a dog and two cats.  But there isn't any dog barking I've ever heard.  The residents are all pretty good, the mgmt is pretty good about getting rid of people who cause problems.  Internal maintenance and repair staff is very good, responds quickly and professionally.  I've always submitted my maintenance requests online as well as paid rent online.  Comes with full-sized washer/dryer, everyone has their own entrance so you don't have people stomping by your door to get to theirs.    Finally the thing that I value the most, buildings are well insulated.  I never hear my neighbors at all, except for garage doors opening/closing which isn't subtle but preferable to neighbor racket.  I also like the location; I can walk to the gym, four grocery stores within a mile, and their are tons of good restaurants in the area.  For our second car we haven't had any problems finding available parking spots.  I've lived in multiple condos/apartments and this is one of the quietest.  I'm told the property was originally intended to be condos, so everything is well-built.  Let me know what other questions you have."

So most big resorts have business centers that are run by third party companies to receive packages that are sent to that resort. They'll charge you so get ready for that."

And if it is possible should i just put the address or my room number too?    That depends.  Do you want the hotel to know what to do and where the package should go once it is delivered?

The host will ensure you get in. Just be sure to get the host's name (and phone number, if possible). If you can communicate with the host, it'll make the process go a lot smoother. Also, in this scenario, you'll almost certainly be entering through the table line, which is much more manageable.  Also, $200 at XS is totally worth it. It's an incredible club."

Cool if you want to see a bunch of place, not cool if you don't want to have to leave every 45 minutes.

If you're looking to get a basic sense of a few clubs then it's a decent deal. Expect to be pressured into tipping your driver and host. Downside is that in my experience you don't get much time at each club, maybe enough for two drinks. My advice is if you find a place you're really into, just stay there."

We did Chateau, Haze, and Light (I think there may have been a fourth but I can't remember).  Light was off the hook.  They serve drinks on the bus and also take you to the Las Vegas sign for pictures.  All in all, totally worth it.  Skipped lines, had a drink or two at the first places then stayed the rest of the night at Light.    We just called them and mentioned Groupon and they gave us the deal.

vegas,3diama,mferg02,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Usually girls are always free especially in August, a lot of the time guys are also in for free as long as it's even ratio (1 guy for every 1 girl), you just need to get on a guest list with a promoter (feel free to let me know if you want the number to the promoter I use for omnia). General admission I don't know is a shorter line, as I've never paid to get in to omnia the 2 times I went since it was free guest list both times, and I've only ever paid twice to go to a club here in Vegas the many times I've gone and the lines did not seem any shorter. Really the line length depends on when you get there. I would get there by no later than 10 to avoid long lines in any line whether it be guest list or general admission or pre-sale ticket line. Your mom will also be fine they don't discriminate based in age, and the clothes you list she would wear seem good as well. For guys dress code gotta wear dress shoes, nice jeans (no rips or tears or anything trashy looking) and I would do a button up collard shirt. Dont know why there is so much hate for clubs here... I came from LA and loved going clubbing out there, moving to Vegas was awesome because I love the club scene out here. Me and my wife never had any issues getting into clubs based on my clothes (I follow those guide lines I listed) or appearance and I've never had a bad experience with security not once. We always enjoy going out to clubs here. We just really like to dance and have getting our own alcohol into the clubs down to a science so maybe that's why too."
vegas,3diama,boootyshorts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"The promoter lines are long bc it's free admission. Last time I went to Omnia, on a weeknight around midnight, the line wrapped all the way around and outside onto the sidewalk. Although that's probably bc it was a ""big name"" act that night. If money isn't tight, just buy the pre-sale tickets or even get a table. You'll be in a different line with a much shorter wait. Also, going earlier helps (like before 11pm) but it can be boring"

vegas,3diama,Wazzoo1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:50 2015 UTC,"If you weren't allowed to wear leather-soled shoes, then you wouldn't be able to wear pretty much every dress shoe in existence. Buy pre-sale tickets (no wait in line), wear a shirt with a collar (polo, button up, whatever), dark jeans or dress pants, and dress shoes or clean and stylish sneakers. You'll be fine. Honestly, the dress codes in Vegas have become a bit more lax over the years as the clubs get bigger and bigger and they need to fill them."

He asked him to step out of the car so that he felt more comfortable. He told him that the other situation was 'unfair' and that this had nothing to do with that.

Pulling the trigger actuates the system that drops the hammer, but in order for the spring in the magazine to push a round into the chamber, the slide would have to also be forced backwards (which would only happen manually, or when it's forced back by the previous round being fired)"
vegas,3dfg49,pweir,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, everything you said is correct leading me to think it was a 9mm revolver with one empty chamber in the cylinder. The trigger pull rotated the cylinder and readies the next round."

With our liberal laws regarding the sale, possession and consumption of alcohol we don't have a ""drunk in public"" charge here.

You could argue that it's a 4th or 5th Amendment violation (and I'd agree), but the courts have already ruled against us in that case.

You have to go to hash house a gogo for breakfast, theres like 6 of them around the town! It is my ultimate pigout spot in Vegas!   Be sure to get to Fremont street at some point , great place to spend some time.  You wont have any trouble finding stuff to do just wandering thr strip, there is something to do around every corner.  If you have any questions about Vegas or America in general ill be more than happy help you out just send me a PM.  You will have a blast, vegas will blow your mind"
vegas,3dd16o,yogurtbear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"budget seems fine, You will murder it if you play any big table games or want to go 2+ nights in a top tier club with bottles (Always go for bottles with 5 people).  Shooting, Helitours, Hiking will spend plenty of time.   I found the outlet malls very very well priced, also from Australia. Had stuff like 2x Ralph Lauren polos for $35. and Buy 1 get one Half price totaling 2 for $40 Tommy hillfiger formal shirts. (1 Mall North strip, 1 Mall South, probably doesn't matter which one you go to, i went south it was fine but a decent drive out on the bus. The deuce will pick you up for cheap on strip all day.   Try see Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood, And go to Grand lux cafe in the Venetian.   If it's your first time in vegas make sure to hit up Shakeshack & In & out burger. Any order is fine.   Avoid strip clubs unless you're desperate to go. The free limos are a big scam to get you there. Even the Spearmint rhino (Top tier) is a huge scum pit.

There are 5 of you and your here for a bachelor party! This means you wanna go big and have some cool memories I assume, especially if you have never been here! I'm born n raised but I lived overseas for a few years, so I know the hype. If I was coming from where you are I would rather have 1k each minimum. You don't want a ""group"" budget for a week in Vegas! You just don't know what your gonna get into out here, and one or more of you are likely to meet and/ or make friends while out and about. Think $100 a day for food, daily entertainment, taxi's, etc. And the food part can be cheap if you don't want to go high end! So eat downtown, and what King of partying do you want to do at night? Strip clubs, regular clubs, gambling..... All this you might want to expand on for your request of info! This is because almost anything goes here from concerts and shows, to getting off the strip to mountains or out to the lake on a house boat you can rent for cheap that strippers naturally gravitate too. If you message me (knew to this site as of today) I can give you alot of ideas. Also beware of chicks reaching out to that are strippers, etc as they may monopolize your time and money (and even if that's what you want) you want variety not just the chick with yes a lot of friends! Of course that's a major industry here! But that also leads to stolen wallets and identify theft if your not careful! But not all of them are like that.

vegas,3d96pg,dookie1481,0,Wed Jul 15 00:45:06 2015 UTC,Eh.  Del Frisco's is a chain. It might be a good steak but it's not unique to Vegas like Circus Circus or Gordon Ramsay
vegas,3d96pg,gitismatt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"Gordon Ramsay has many restaurants so it's a chain as well, but regardless, whether or not it's a chain is irrelevant. Their entire beef process is amazing from the selection to the preparation.  Lastly, circus circus is in a ghetto."

Random people can vote for the 'best' steakhouse or whatever. You think the high end steakhouses are swarming these polls? No, the 2nd rate steakhouses that need customers have their employees banging votes to skew the results. I'm guessing you work there since you are so adamant that this washed-up run-down casino steakhouse, that smells like mold and cigarette smoke, ranks among the many great steakhouses in Vegas. Anyway, end of story. I have more important things to do than educate you on poll tampering and fine dining. Adios muchachos.

vegas,3d6m1e,JethroByte,12,Mon Jul 13 22:49:04 2015 UTC,"I live near Sam's Town and it's my go-to if I want to play blackjack or craps.  Here are some things to know:   I've never stayed in the hotel, but the casino is decent and it has a beautiful atrium with trees/fountains. The neighborhood is rough.  Do not go walking at night.  Even during the day you will see hookers, homeless people, and other people you generally don't want to know working the street. Has an attached movie theater. 15 minute drive from the strip. Since it's on the east side of town, it has easy access to Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, or Wetlands Park if you want get away from Vegas for an afternoon. The food is ok.   The steak house is mid-end and the Friday night buffet is good for the price ($20 for steak and hot crab legs). For 24 hour food there is a 'greasy spoon' down the street called Longhorn which is a favorite locals destination for 3am eats. $3 craps during the week with 20x odds.  $5 on the weekends.  Generally friendly dealers who will want to get to know you.   So generally not a bad casino but if you want easy access to the strip you may want to try your luck somewhere else."
vegas,3d6m1e,Chipware,2,Mon Jul 13 22:59:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  Is there somewhere else you'd suggest in maybe a better neighborhood?  My wife and I do like to get out and walk / sight see.

vegas,3d6m1e,boihbeez,2,Tue Jul 14 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"I actually stayed there recently! The hotel rooms are decent. They offer suites as well and I heard they're pretty nice. All of the rooms have a view of the atrium. If you and your wife plan on going to sleep early, I'd recommend somewhere else, though. They have a laser show every few hours and the last one is at 10(?... I think). It's sort of loud, but not obnoxious.  As far as the neighborhood goes... As mentioned, it's not the best. However, the walking around the atrium is is nice and it's a fairly close drive to vegas landmarks.  I'd recommend it as a cheaper alternative to staying on the strip."

vegas,3d6m1e,emceelokey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:45:01 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in to talk about the neighborhoods, as mentioned many times Sam's Town is in a bad area, but if you are just staying there it is safe.  Someone suggested looking into The Red Rock resort, its located in Summerland, which is an upscale neighborhood in Las Vegas.  Nearby they recently opened an outdoor mall called Downtown Summerlin, that is just behind the casino.  Across the street there is a decent amount of places to eat, also a Costco.  South point is located in the Spring Valley area, also a nice part of Vegas.  Not to far from southpoint is Silverton. Same neighborhood, safe area, cheap rooms, there is a Bass Pro shop attached to the casino, that has a nice fake waterfall.  The M casino is a bit further away, also a decent neighborhood, but sparse.  The suggestions for the downtown casinos are good, but be prepared to pay a parking surcharge.  For whatever reason parking anywhere downtown is not free.  The downtown area is safer than Sam's town as long as you stay on Fremont street. I wouldn't stray to other streets at night.  My two cents. Hope you enjoy your trip =)"

Since you already have a car rented to get you around b the coty, you'll be fine. Never stayed there because I live here but it's a great place. And all you have to do to get to the strip is head west on Flamingo for about 15 minutes and you'll be at the heart of the strip.  There's also a few neighboring casinos on the boulder strip by Sam's Town you can check out as well."

It's not the nicest joint but if you're just looking for a clean enough bed and a hot shower it will do.   It's only a 5 minute walk to the strip too. Cant beat the location and the price. In my 20s when I used to go to Vegas every couple months if we were strapped for cash me and couldn't afford a room on thw strip me and my buddies would all just pile in a room. I think the most we jammed in there one trip was like 12 people, ended up only costing like 10 bucks a person for the whole weekend. Granted this was over 10 years ago. Lol."

vegas,3d8iqe,Stu_Pac88,6,Tue Jul 14 09:46:10 2015 UTC,"Room reservations agent here  What I recommend you doing is to look closely at whatever website you booked through and understand the room your are booking. A lot of the times, people just see the lowest rate and book that room when in fact they wanted the pool view (which is considered an upgrade) or two queen beds (yes we charge extra for two beds). Then, when you tip the front desk agent you'll know if you got upgraded or not when you get into your room. The room type may have been the same, but the better view might be considered an upgrade.   I still don't know why it's called the ""$20 trick"" because you are essentially tipping the front desk agent. No tricks involved. The agent knows very well what you are referring to. In Vegas if you tip somebody well, they will take care of you. Try and tip the valet $20, they will have your car outside waiting for you when you arrive at the valet.  There is a chance that the tip might not work, because the hotel might be sold out of rooms, therefore there won't be a upgraded room to upgrade you to (yes we sell out of suites very occasionally). If you REQUIRE a suite for your stay, I always recommend paying extra and booking the specific suite so it can be guaranteed."
vegas,3d8iqe,thatcaveman,3,Tue Jul 14 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"Las Vegas Strip hotels tend to have a more diverse room selection than normal hotels across the country.  Upgrades are a critical component of the casino model, using better rooms to entice more gambling at the property's casino.  For example: The Cosmopolitan has seven different room types plus a few villa/bungalow accommodations.  Even comparing their Tier 1 room to their Tier 2 room shows a significant improvement.  There's only a $30/nt difference, but if you were upgraded, you would know.  And, depending on the circumstances, you could get an even higher tier.  There's also the view.  In some cases, an upgrade from a ""City View"" to a ""Strip View"" or ""Fountain View"" may be significant.  Bottom line: the $20 trick often works (I've used it successfully many times), and you will likely know the difference when you see the upgraded room."
vegas,3d8iqe,SurlyQueue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:11 2015 UTC,"Ok I’m going to give it a try when I’m over in August, didn’t try it last time we stayed at the Flamingo however I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a mini suite for an extra $20 per night which we didn’t take, the room we got was nice enough anyway and we overlooked the Wildlife Habitat. Were staying in Harrah’s this time for our 1 year Wedding Anniversary is it worth laying it on think and telling them this when hand over the $20 with our ID and Credit card or are the chances of getting upgraded still the same?"
vegas,3d8iqe,SurlyQueue,3,Tue Jul 14 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely worth it.    The person checking you in has a certain amount of leeway in what room they give you.  The $20 trick is one of several ways to get that person to WANT to give you an upgrade.  (It is important to remember: you are not buying an upgrade, you are just improving your favorability in the eyes of this person.)  Basically, you want them to see you differently from every other person in line, you want them to like you, and you want them to want to improve your stay.    You are dealing with a single human being and all of the normal tricks for social interaction apply.  Be warm, be friendly, be appreciative, be complimentary.  Mention the anniversary, give your spouse a squeeze, give off the newlywed glow.  Tell them how excited you are to be staying there, mention a restaurant in that property that you're dying to try, ask if they've seen an in-house show (i.e. Mac King) and if you should get tickets.  One of the hardest things to do is to ask for the upgrade, but it has the best chance of working.  Be familiar with the room options (from the website) and the view options (Harrah's has two premium views: The Strip and The High Roller).  Ask if there are any upgrades available (I recommend you NOT say ""free upgrades"" at this point).   Sometimes, there is nothing available (especially if it's a holiday and they're busy).  Sometimes, the upgrade will require an additional cost.  You may have to decide on the spot if the petite suite (which is 5x more expensive than the standard room) is worth an extra 20/nt.  They simply may not be able to do ""free"", but the offer may be a significant discount and may be worth considering.  Just remember: this is a gamble (hopefully the first of many while you are in Vegas).  Don't let it get to you if it doesn't work out.  And don't try it if it will ruin your trip.  I've paid $20/nt for an ""upgrade"" that I've regretted.  It happens.  Don't let it ruin your trip."

Here's one for you guys that do this more than I do: How about arriving at 9 PM on a Friday night? Will the nicer rooms be taken up and thus give me less of a chance to upgrade?"
vegas,3d8iqe,ilikeloudmusic,2,Wed Jul 15 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"you're more likely to get upgraded to a much nicer room if you checked in on saturday night or sun-thurs.  by saturday night, they already have an idea of whos coming or not and what they have left in inventory."

vegas,3d5pej,LA_all_day,5,Mon Jul 13 18:56:50 2015 UTC,"I can only offer my viewpoint as a 3 times a year visitor, and as a heavy drinker and heavier gambler.   If you don't want to be exhausted or tired when coming back, try a higher end place that offers more on its property. Less walking.   Know your limits. And the limits of those you're traveling with. Party too hard one night? Spend the next day at the pool, at the spa, shopping or something easy. Shows are a good way to do this.   Take the tram. I normally stay at the Grand, and always take the team when I want to visit the other end of the strip. And they always have plenty of cabbies waiting for off strip activities.   Try a day trip. Nevada has tons of things to do and see outside of Vegas.   But that's just my opinion and how I normally avoid that feeling you describe. But always, do what you want as long as you have a good time."
vegas,3d5pej,jagerwick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"You know, I've actually never taken the tram, this is a good idea. And yeah, the more I've been thinking about it, the more I've come to realize that spending a bit more on a higher end place might pay dividends in not having to walk everywhere.   Thanks for the tip! Any day trip ideas?"
vegas,3d5pej,MothershipConnection,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"Also from LA and I'm usually in Vegas 2-3 times a year (usually one is work related else I'd do 1-2 times per year) and I've actually found myself enjoying my visits more as I've gotten older (just hit 30 this year) and been less inclined to binge drink and been less single. When I was younger I felt more pressure to have the BEST NIGHT EVER(C), but the last couple years I've been actively trying to do less and just relax more. Instead of trying to do like 5 things in a day, plan on doing one thing you really want to do and let the rest fall in place. Instead of going hard every night I'm there, I'll take it easy the night I get there and have a drink at the hotel bar or something.  I definitely agree with jagerwick's suggestion to do things outside of Vegas or at least outside the Strip a bit.   And of course just as much depends on the company you're with. Last time I was there was in May for an old friend of mine's birthday with a big group of about 8 of us, most of whom aren't huge drinkers or huge partygoers, and it was a great time just to spend actual time with them which you don't really get to do as adults. Instead of just getting everyone fucked up, enjoy each other's company you know?"

There is also a zip line you could go on here.  Go to the neon museum for a tour of all the old neon signs. (Also near downtown) Rent a fancy sports car and drive up to Red Rock Canyon National Park. It's a big loop you can drive through the mountains.  Go up to Mount Charleston. There's a lodge at the top you can have lunch at. It is always about 20 degrees cooler here.

vegas,3d24dw,gitismatt,3,Tue Jul 14 08:25:49 2015 UTC,I really enjoy fish and chips.  I was sadly disappointed with Crown and Anchor.  It was subpar to say the least. My current favorite fish and chips is Main Street Station downtown.  They have their own microbrew inside.  They use their own beer to make the batter for the fish.  The chips are just regular american fries though.

vegas,3d3xxe,DevilsAdvocate77,0,Mon Jul 13 18:17:17 2015 UTC,"Going to happy hour is not a Vegas-specific trick     But gaming the happy hours can be.  A little planning and you can line up not paying full price for specialty cocktails or craft beers, celebrity-chef appetizers, and some pretty cool venues and views.  Not to mention the open-bar happy hour, the 10 pm happy hour, the 3am-5am happy hour, and so on.  All only in Vegas baby.   The novelty of cramming 3 people into a suite with one king bed wears off real quick     True.  However she says they got a bed added as part of the deal.  But most hotels have more 'two-queens' than 'one-king' rooms because there are people in one room that don't want to share the bed.  In a town where you spend so little time in your room, adding a third person to that equation, in a king-suite where everyone gets their own bathroom and other spaces seems like a good trade for three nights sometimes.  I'm too old to do that kind of thing but I don't shit on other people's choice to do it.  Knowing how to do the $$ trick to get an upgrade seems like gaming the hotel room system to me.   Foundation Room is a tourist trap not an elite private club     I can't find where she said to go to the Foundation Room.  But even so, you, um, know this is a tourist-based everything town, right?  Or should only what you would call elite private clubs exist in Vegas and nothing else?  This isn't an article about how to pay an obscene amount of money for a table and a bottle of vodka in a club.  It's about having fun without paying your next car payment to have a drink in a club.     If your trip to Vegas is going to be made or broken by a $5 monorail ticket, you're gonna have a bad time     You've completely missed the point.  The trams are no substitute for other modes of transportation.  Try getting on the tram at Bellagio and go to, say, Mandalay.  You'll be scratching your head as to why you're doing so much walking, and that's when you walk through Bellagio to get onto your first leg of the trip.     The Hyatt CC status bump is legit but, again, not really a Vegas-specific trick because it applies to all Hyatt-affiliated hotels worldwide. It's also $75/year after the first year. She doesn't even mention the real value which is getting 2 free nights when you sign up.     But her point is, in part, about leveraging the partnership between Hyatt and Mlife for use at the Mirage (that property is only in Vegas in case you didn't know)     Simply paying the going rate to stay at Excalibur is not ""gaming"" anything, even if it's only $15. She also neglects to mention the mandatory resort fee, which is more than the room rate.     The resort fees are a scam, but you can't really think that because Excalibur has one she shouldn't stay there, no matter the room price.  Also, suppose you get a bone-in, dry-aged for 28 days, sirloin at Smith & Wollensky for, say, $100 and I get the same thing at a little-known steak restaurant not everyone knows about, at half the price and much, much better service.  First, are we going to argue about the price of parking at each?  Second, I'm going to smirk at your willingness to light your cigars with $20 bills while I have money left over to partake in other Vegas things.  Third, I don't know what qualifies as gaming but playing these transactions and choices to my optimum advantage works for me.    Keep working on your opposition arguments and maybe someday you'll be DevilsAdvocate1."

I'm not sure if you need a class.   The basics of smart money decisions are simple:   Make a budget and stick to it. The envelope system works for me. I plan out where my money will go every month down to the penny - mortgage, car, grocery, utilities, fuel, phone and entertainment. My entertainment money is cash so once I spend it I know there is no more.  Eliminate debt - pay off your credit cards. Interest is slavery. Pay off your car. The less money that goes out  every month, the more money you have in your pocket to enjoy.  Save - putting ten percent of your net income away won't kill you. Put it in the bank until you have at least 2-6 months of expenses set aside for emergency. Once that is complete you should look for a financial adviser who will invest your savings in a good growth mutual funds.    This may be an oversimplification, but it's sound advice. A class/course on personal finance would tell you the same thing."

Has a lot to do with how the venue chooses to control people, and apparently Brooklyn Bowl chooses not to."

vegas,3cvm2i,DrinksWellWithOthers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Well, Nacho Daddy was a popular spot with Zappos employees and their CEO, Tony Hsieh.  So when Zappos moved their headquarters from Henderson to downtown, Hsieh became a partner with the restaurant to open a location near the new Zappos headquarters.  So it comes well-recommended.   Also, you can take a tour of Zappos while you're in the area if you like."

Honestly 115 for the apple store is not bad for original parts, if you go outside there is 0 original parts, its all just refurbished or parts that have been made by different manufactures.    Goto apple IMO(I fixed Cell phones for 2 years and the parts we used were sometimes not the best quality but when the iPhone 5 came out we charged $120 to replace the glass, if apple is offering for 115 do it).

Terrible traffic getting in and no more free parking anywhere means I'd rather just hit one of the other 1 million options to chill out on a free night.  I dunno whats going on with DTLV but the first thing they really need to do is figure out how to get free parking up for local visitors.  Ironically one of the big reasons why free parking went away from all the casinos is cuz Zappos employees were abusing it."
vegas,3crqcd,Photojared,8,Fri Jul 10 07:09:31 2015 UTC,Why would zappos employees park in the free public garages when the can park in the private guarded Zappos garage?  Out of all the zappos people that I know (which is a lot) none of them park in the free garages.

Yes, I know it's only $5 but it's the point of paying to enter a building so I can pay for drinks that have also gone up in price the last 5 years. It just enrages me for some reason.   We've found some places have actually stopped charging cover and we go there instead and they are usually packed."

Town square, GV and ""downtown"" Summerlin  are nice and clean, wholesome family friendly shopping and entertainment districts, whereas downtown (including the arts district) is grungy, edgy with a seedy underbelly and an alternative, counter-culture vibe, much like The LES or Bushwick in NYC, Haight Ashbury or the Missions in SF (before the current massive gentrification),East Side of Austin etc. It really depends on what you are into. Do you like yupppieville or are you too cool for school?"

I don't think you'll find anything on the Strip.  Guns: Lol yes the Strip is well policed. There's a place called The Range 702 that's near the Strip where you can shoot guns. You can even shoot a machine gun there if that tickles your fancy.   Excursions: I don't think a bus tour to Hoover Dam would be worth it. Neither would the Grand Canyon.

Maybe the small handful of idiots who take Fox News as gospel, but most of us don't. To the contrary, actually.  I think you all across the pond forget just how big this country is."
vegas,3cq1w1,PoketheBadger,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Nor do we.  But it is hilarious how they blame Obama for pretty much everything.  The gun toting thing is was sarcasm man.  Something we across the pond base love.
vegas,3cq1w1,Parev00,8,Thu Jul 9 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it just seemed strange to me to lead off with that while asking for favors (even if very small effort favors) :). It is hilarious how they blame Obama for everything.  Anyhow,   15-20% is about the base minimum for just about everyone tip wise. If you're drinking about 1-2 dollars a drink is perfect and will keep the service coming. Any more than that is not necessary for bartenders/drink servers at the casinos. The more the merrier though if you can spare it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/2g0u2g/guide_to_valet_by_a_former_vegas_valet/ here's a good guide to tipping your valet. The standard rules are not all that different than any other establishment though there is a little bit of leeway since you technically have two different interactions (dropping car off and picking it up).  Cab drivers unfortunately will expect about 15-20% even though most of them do a shit job and are rude/scary drivers. At least by my standards. Go in expecting the worst and then maybe it won't be so bad :). Sorry, just have to be honest about that.   Front desk personnel at hotels don't expect a tip but if you slip them a $20 they could upgrade you to a nicer room if it's not crazy booked that night. Here's a link to read more about that: http://thetwentydollartrick.com/. My personal two cents, though: skip the ""$20 sandwich"" routine, and just hand them a $20 and tell them to keep it. It has never failed for me. You just have to want to risk giving the $20 and not getting an upgrade. At the very least though you made someone who has a hard job a little happier.  It's nice to tip your casino dealer a chip every now and then, but it's only really expected if you've been consistently ""up"" with your dollar amounts.  The strip is very well policed, don't worry about anything. The later it gets, the higher the chance of some drunken shenanigans happening, but it really is not a big deal. I can't imagine it's any different than a UK pub crawl, if not safer. The reality: most everyone in Vegas is in the same situation you're in, and is just there to vacation and have a good time (or party in between work conferences or stuff like that). I'm pretty introverted by nature but hanging out on the strip and Fremont/downtown opens me up pretty well because so many people are in a good, relaxed friendly mood.   The rock scene is not so hot here. Bars downtown like The Griffin and Insert Coins will cater to your demographic but I don't think there's a whole ton of shows going on at any given moment.   Can't speak to Hoover or the Grand Canyon, I've never been. But Hoover is really not far and everything I've seen suggests that it's worth the fairly short drive to see it.   Bavarian beer: there are a lot of places on and off the strip with huge beer selections but for what you're looking for maybe this place will serve you well: http://www.hofbrauhauslasvegas.com/the-beer/. It's a bavarian style Oktoberfest themed place with food and beer. Right there on the strip.  When will you be here? I'm out of town for a little bit but maybe I can get you a beer when you arrive."

Wasn't 100 percent set on financing anything because if I waited til we got taxes I could get one at a good price in the off season next year.

Unfortunately, that doesn't fit your dates.  As for things like funk and rock and roll, there are no nightclubs, per say, but there are places on the strip that will cater to that, like live bands (including cover bands) and such.

I would have the wiring/connections checked in your home before switching. Cox has been pretty good as far as service consistency. Certainly not a Comcast lite. Cox will typically credit your account if you tell them you are having issues, and will even send someone out to check the line.   Sounds like bad wiring or a loose connection outside. Heat or wind hit it, and you drop the signal. Overheating equipment could also be an issue depending on what you are using and where you have it located. Having the router stacked on top of the TV receiver and tucked into a tight nook can lead to issues.    If you use your connection for work, you could look into getting a dedicated business line, which will also grant you priority service."
vegas,3cpjho,PPG113,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Former tech from Cox here, and in most cases it can be the modem or router... outages do come from time to time and are brief. Of course during excessive weather, distortion/noise can come through the lines especially if the coax is old. In some neighborhoods the wiring is old and the node needs to be repaired, but overall cox does good maintenance overall.  Cox is the best isp in town and im sure cox has the gigabit internet also. Just call them and have them ping your modem and router...and take it from there."

vegas,3clyf2,jrshaul,2,Wed Jul 8 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"I will teach you to drive stick. FWIW, it makes used economy cars much less valuable (sorry, awesometographer....)  Unless you can find a relatively new car with major depreciation issues (like a GM econobox with a stickshift,) $8k is squarely in the used-is-more-desirable-than-new bracket for people who can't afford new cars. Depending on your credit, spending more to get something new or manufacturer certified with a long warranty and a subsidized loan is potentially a better option in the long term. My father, for example, bought a 1YO Scion for $20,000 - he wasn't looking to spend more than $15k, but the combination of ~2.5% financing and a ludicrous nine year powertrain warranty meant that he's going to come out ahead in the long term.  That said, if you can find one, the 2WD Toyota 4runner is a beast with very low resale value. The engine in my girlfriends' runs better at 250,000 miles than my Mazda at 50k. 20+MPG with a slushbox, too, which is pretty good for an SUV, and I've seen decent examples for under $4,000.  The Scion Xb and Xd are both great deals used or new, the Toyota Avalon is about as luxurious as you're going to get before running costs get stupid, and the second-generation Mazda Miata has an engine so durable it's actually banned from a cheap-car endurance racing series."

If they do file for an eviction you will be given a 5 day notice posted by the landlord followed by a 3 day notice after that. The three day notice will have a court date and time on it for which you can show up and give the evidence of all your paid rent and if you can prove you do not owe them rent, the judge will not grant the eviction. I'm not 100% on them posting a 5 day since they gave you a 10 day but you will definitely get a 3 day notice posted from the constable office which will have the court date."

From my understanding for evictions here, the park first places a lien on the property and then files to assume ownership. That's one of my concerns that even if they attempt to evict me and fail, wouldn't they still have a lien on my property?   Sorry I know you're not an attorney, I'm just trying to understand this process and how to fight it because 1.) I don't want to become a poster on /r/homeless and 2.) I'm kind of pissed off that despite being presented with evidence that I'm current on my rent payments they're behaving like I owe them money."

What I can tell you is to look closely at the notice and see what it says the follow up actions are. I still doubt they could do anything to kick you off the land without a court date and providing proof.  Liens are another animal though. A great service is the self help legal center at the regional justice center. They won't provide legal advice but can probably give you a better idea of what the process is for your specific situation. Also, you may want to post to r/legaladvice and see if they can provide any advice. Hope this helps!"

There is absolutely no reason to continue with such a law, as it's incredibly outdated and only increases the danger on the road. I can't tell you how many people come in to get repairs because they were ran off the road by impatient drivers, when it otherwise would have been avoidable had they been legally allowed to drive faster. I've had one customer come in and show me a ticket they got because they sped up to 40 mph when a large semi truck was riding their ass within 2 feet of their bike, coming close to running him over. The cop said it didn't matter, and he was breaking the law by speeding, and the cop chose to pull him over instead of the tailgating asshole behind them.

vegas,3ckrky,StephanSF,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:37:04 2015 UTC,"The roads around here are not bad at all... once you get out of Vegas which has a lot of bad drivers, the interstates and rural highways are well maintained and relatively spacious, at least compared to European roads. That being said, if you are used to driving on the wrong side of the road (j/k) driving could be stressful.   Here's a company I know of and have used for my clients that does bus tours to the various Grand Canyon rims: https://www.zerve.com/sweetours  FYI, the South Rim is the National Park portion of the Canyon and generally the most spectacular but its a lot further away than the west rim. The West Rim is part of the Hualapai Indian reservation and is where the Sky Walk (glass bottom walk) is located. There is also the North Rim which is the least visited by tourists, but also a fair distance away from Vegas (about the same as the South Rim.. i.e. about 5 hours driving each way).  If you've never seen the canyon, you'll find the West Rim to be impressive, and since it is closer to Vegas thats where all the Helicopter tours go. Ive found that the skywalk is a total rip, the Indians are making the most of it financially and nickel and diming the tourists. During peak seasons it can be a wait to get on it, you cant take your camera, you have to pay for lockers to store your stuff (including your camera that you brought to take that picture). But the skywalk is optional, its not integral to the experience.  Hope that helps. enjoy your visit."
vegas,3ckrky,crzycicada,2,Thu Jul 9 11:06:00 2015 UTC,Totally agreed!  The lockers are free though but everything else is indeed a tourist trap.

The airport is not in a crazy part of town I don't think and the highway to take to go to GCNP is close by so you wouldn't have to fight too many crazy drivers!

vegas,3ckrky,music4mic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:57:25 2015 UTC,"We just rented a car and drove out there, stopping at the Hover Dam on the way.  It took 4.5 hrs each way roughly and and got to see some really beautiful and diverse scenery along the way.  Maybe the bus is a better fit for you, but to put it in perspective, car rental was $100, fuel was about $40 and admission to Grand Canyon national park was $30.    It was so beautiful and awe inspiring that we've decided next time we are going to camp and hike in the park for 5-7 days, then drive to Vegas spend only a day or 2 there (opposite of what we did this time).   EDIT:  Noticed you posted about the crazy drivers in Vegas.  In the morning, when you'll likely be leaving, it's not bad at all.  It is a little crazy at night, but not that much worse than any other major city I've driven in."
vegas,3ckrky,Holeysox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"It's not really the seats or the ride that makes it uncomfortable. It's more of the crying babies and people being loud/ stinking it up. I'd recommend the rental car option. Or if you give me like $100 and pay for gas if I'm not working I'll drive you. I have an extended cab truck, it's got a decent sized back seat."

vegas,3ci9sb,bicuriousthrwawy,5,Wed Jul 8 03:02:35 2015 UTC,AirBNB or VBRO. They serve the exact purpose you are looking for.  Cabs are shitty and expensive. Try finding a rental West or South of the strip.

But you'd be surprised how many hotels in LV allow pets, and the places just off the strip can be less busy, cheaper, and in some cases nicer than the better-known hotels on the strip.  Cab ... no one here is a fan ... but cab rides a few blocks on/off the strip are nothing compared to the energy you save driving and worrying about drinking & driving."

vegas,3ci9sb,Netsuai,3,Wed Jul 8 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think the Henderson area provides the best combination of ""nicer, safe area"" and ""close to the strip"".    I recommend you rent a car if you are not staying on the strip.  Use a taxi in the evening when you are planning on drinking, but during the day, you'll wish you could go places.  Taxis will add up if you are using them all day.  Worst case scenario: if you find yourself on the strip with your car and want to drink, you can leave the car in any of the casinos' garages overnight (free parking) and take a cab home.  Then take a taxi back to get your car the next morning."

Personally, I'd go UNLV because it has a semi-college atmosphere (still a commuter school mostly), and you may be able to make connections for work through Boyd School of Law.

DTP did invest in a few apartment complexes but, as you saw, they generally are smaller and still a bit pricey. John S Park houses would be your best bet in terms of price and square footage. It's also pretty safe.  Additionally, while not really considered downtown: I have a few friends that live across the 15 in both Mayan Apartments (Alta and Shadow) and the 3-story townhomes just north of Mayan. You can take a look at both on Zillow. The houses around Alta and Shadow/Rancho/Valley View are also great but possibly a little pricier than what you're looking for.  Also note that the farther east you look in downtown, the rougher the area is."

vegas,3cd93s,golfwithafrisbee,3,Tue Jul 7 17:18:09 2015 UTC,I think the Bucks would use one of the privately-financed arenas under construction here. I believe the MLS stadium was going to be built with public money.
vegas,3cd93s,travel_more,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"They world probably use the privately financed arena that AEG and MGM are building behind NY,NY. The soccer stadium involved public money, which is always a different story."
vegas,3cd93s,chillwerk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. But the city and state would be foolish to throw away $250M of private money by not ponying up the remaining $250M. In addition, the new ownership group has plans for $1B in developments around the new arena. This is just grandstanding by the politicians to show their constituents that they will fight against potential new taxes. Eventually they will cave and the Bucks will stay in Milwaukee. The old owner was a US Senator, Herb Kohl. His main condition on selling the team was that they would stay in Milwaukee. He hand picked this new ownership group because he knows they will keep them there. The same exact thing happened back when Miller Park was being discussed for the Milwaukee Brewers. In the end, the state ended up covering the entire cost of the stadium, $290M. This situation is much less of a burden for the tax payers, based on inflation and the fact that private money is available as well."
vegas,3cd93s,SpikeMcAwesome,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:15:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured it was the owners ""using"" us to get more money/more favorable deal with Milwaukee.

vegas,3cbkx6,nipsizbomb,3,Mon Jul 6 22:56:07 2015 UTC,I went through the CSN recording certificate program. I would say go through CSN as it is cheaper and John Jacobson is a great teacher.   Every class is about 3 hours long and half of it is a lecture and the other half is spent in the recording room. The CSN has 2 rooms with 2 different consoles to learn from. One is the Triton console that is all analog and has several different synthesizers in the room. The other room has an SSL AWS 900 and that is both analog and digital and that room comes with a patchbay and is bigger and has different equipment to go through and that's the room you will mostly be in 90% of the time.   CSN also has another room that you can get into that has 3 different Apple computers where you can mess around with ProTools  and the VI plug ins outside of class hours.   I'd prefer CSN or a different university if you want to get into Audio Production because of the price and time. If you have any questions feel free to PM me and I'd answer as fast as I can!

It is what you make of it, the teachers I had were very talented, informative and helpful. Many people who went there were under the impression that a degree earned them a job and they're still not working in the industry they went to school for. The counselors are not responsible for getting you a job, YOU are. As long as you go in willing to learn and you have some ambition, you'll do just fine.  I really enjoyed AILV and without it, I wouldn't be where I am today. It also helped form friendships and connections I wouldn't of had otherwise and that was a good leg up."

vegas,3ca18l,ne0codex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:31:45 2015 UTC,"I think the big question is this:  Are you going to stay in Las Vegas (or Nevada in general) after you graduate?  If not, then you have to compare how UNLV's degree will be viewed compared to one from Alaska (or another similar institution).  Will UNLV's degree help you get a leg up on a job that you otherwise wouldn't have with a degree earned elsewhere?  On the other side, if you're going to say in Vegas, then people will love to see UNLV degrees.  Employers will have experience with UNLV grads and will have an idea what you should know at the time of employment.    So a catch all question of ""Is it a good school?"" is actually a really terrible question.  It's person-dependent and situation-dependent.    Edit to add:  I just finished one degree there and I'm starting a second in the fall.  Don't think I'm shitting on the school at all or that I have something against UNLV.  I just won't leave Nevada, except in retirement or vacation.  So my degrees will be looked upon favorably."

vegas,3ca18l,TharBeSquirrels,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't mean that out of state degrees aren't taken seriously here in Vegas.  I mean that UNLV degrees aren't looked at too favorably.  At least not where I'm from (Boston), where there are 21340781234 other schools ranked higher.  A degree is a degree is a degree.  Once someone is hired, it shouldn't matter.  But listing the degree on a resume and getting your foot in the door is something else entirely.  A UNLV degree will get your foot in the door just fine in Nevada.  Outside of NV... I just don't know."
vegas,3ca18l,jettnoir,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:29:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest... It's just a school. It's really here just because we kinda need one. The professors are rarely impressive in their instruction methods, half the time I can barely understand them over their accent and I find more useful information in the book anyway. Which, speaking of, if you find yourself unfortunate enough to land in a class where the professor publishes their own books through the UNLV press, you'll be gouged every penny for that specific UNLV version of the text (and for that specific Edition, since you need the correct page numbers for the homework assignments which are based on questions for that specific book editor only)  UNLV basically has the same level of authenticity that the Las Vegas Strip has to the real-world places they pretend to be.  UNLV is no source for culture, nor does it foster it for the Community. For people I know who are going to graduate/have graduated (including me) basically go to UNLV because it gives them the degree.  As far as criminal justice goes, I remember taking a 101 class freshman year for an elective, this was around the time when Twitter and hashtags was growing in popularity so for homework we had to create a a Twitter account and tweet CRJ related articles..."

It is a 3rd tier school for everything else. Most people don't graduate because they can make decent money in Vegas without a degree (however that is beginning to change). It is referred to by locals and alumni as ""University of Never Leaving"". Compared to UNR, UNLV has a much weaker program."

vegas,3ca18l,SpikeMcAwesome,-1,Mon Jul 6 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"The law school is ranked low. I believe it is still 3rd tier and since it is only 14 years old you're not going to be making the networking connections you would if you went to a better law school with a longer history and thus more prominent alumni.   Plus, the J.D. market is over saturated with idiots who got underwater basket weaving degrees and realized they wouldn't have a job, thus the answer is law school. Now you have too many lawyers and not enough jobs. If you're ok with that and/or like doc review/ or have an in like daddy owns a law firm, then by all means go! :D"

UNLV isn't nor has never been in the top 14 law schools, despite ""9th in dispute resolution"" and such.   The priceless part of going to a top tier school, in any field, is the networking. Having a bullshit underwater basket-weaving degree from Harvard is worth more than having one from say, UNLV, due to the networking.   If you are in Vegas or have lived there you know the value of ""who you know"".

My plan was to register the car in TX where I am resident. I wasn't able to complete that in TX, and now I'm in VA for work, before moving overseas in a week. I still need to title the car, and the dealership finally sent me some paperwork, but it did not include a transfer of ownership, which VA says is required in order to title the vehicle. I can't title the car at all now (the dealership won't return my calls on how to obtain the transfer of ownership). The car is financed, but the finance company says they can't do anything until the dealership sends them the title. Which the dealership has now sent me off to handle, and the DMV says I can't do with what I have. Anyone have any suggestions, advice, or insight?"

You cannot legally drive a car without having liability insurance (or, to be precise, without proof of financial responsibility).

They are offering Tier bonus points (the points for you to upgrade) if you earn 2500 in a day you gain 5k bonus do this for 2 days and get to Diamond level. (diamond is the 2nd top tier just below the super whale card). Benifits are 2 free show tickets a month, tons and tons of offers, free food and the such. My total cost to get to 15k points cost me around 1500 ish.. I played only slot machines and ones that had a high rate of return for longer play and better point accumulation."

Which is pretty actually good for locals since it lets you use the diamond lounges, cut lines all over the place, and get two tickets a month for various lower tier shows.  For people staying at Caesars properties, Diamond also lets you skip Resort Fees.    It's through FoundersCard, some travel perks membership card that costs a couple hundred bucks a year.  Membership in FoundersCard gives the perk that they upgrade your Caesars status to Diamond.   It's the route I went this year because I'm more risk averse than I used to be, and the decent video poker at Caesars properties in Vegas gives crappy tier points now.  Anyway, I'd be happy to pimp out some referral links if you're interested.  I think their default rate is something nobody actually pays, but when you inquire a bit they offer some better deals."

You might also try adding some powdered Gatorade if you will be moving and sweating. You could also experiment with going outside or on the porch or a something for small increments each day to get yourself used to it.

vegas,3bwmfw,Abstract_17,15,Thu Jul 2 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Let's see if I remember my Nevada History class from back in middle school. Pretty sure Las Vegas was just a small desert community back in the early part of the 20th century (might have been a rail stop as well?). Then Boulder City was setup to house people coming to work on the dam. Leaders didn't want their workers getting drunk and gambling their money away, so both were outlawed in Boulder City. This lead to people opening vice services in Las Vegas and it just grew from there. Gambling is still illegal in Boulder City.  Pre-the white man, Las Vegas was actually a really good place for a settlement(relativity). It's name means ""The Meadows"" as there were grass plains and springs in the area.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."

vegas,3bwmfw,infamousboone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:13:12 2015 UTC,Consumption. The springs dried up as demand increased and wells were dug. The water table dropped and large scale farming became unsustainable.   With a lower water table and no surface water there was nothing to sustain the plants that relied on anything more than the rain.  I'd have a hard time calling it a meadow to begin with though. There would just be a lot more trees and desert-y shrubs surrounding the pockets of water (like an oasis).   The tall trees you see inside the Springs Preserve along US95 are not native and were planted (and sustained) by the wife of the original owner of the ranch. They line the path of the original LV creek and are over 100 years old!    The land that was worked was eventually sold off and turned into housing.

It's done with about 330,000 acre/ft per year.   That's fucking awesome (as in awe inspiring) any way you look at it. We are doing something that could only be dreamed of 80 years ago. Las Vegas is a model city for conserving water and making do with the resources available, so much so that how we survive here as a metropolis is studied and copied all over the world.   Someday someone will say how sad it is that we destroyed the original Mars when after it was terraformed but they will use some of the technology and techniques to survive that we learned right here in this little gambling oasis.

It also had the added benefit of being much easier to dig the holes to bury the bodies.   In all seriousness, for those who don't know, the valley was once the seabed of a prehistoric ocean and Mt Charleston was actually an island. As the sea receded it was quite lush and beautiful but as the geology and climate changes we got plopped on the edge of the Mojave desert."

vegas,3bwmfw,peeinmyblackeyes,4,Thu Jul 2 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"Bare in mind that when the valley was first settled the LV Creek and a few other water sources ran freely in the valley.   LV started as a Mormon fort for those weary pioneers traveling to/fro St George (the temporary home of the LDS church) and Salt Lake. The fort was eventually abandoned but the railroad (Union Pacific) used the free running water as a water stop for the steam locomotives that traveled through the valley.   The area surrounding the creek was farmed until the drinking water demand exceeded the available water and the Las Vegas Creek dried up. Wells were dug and other industries took over. (Side note: there is still an active farm, Gilcrese Orchard, in the northern part of that valley. They grow apples and several seasonal vegetables and are open to the public most days!)    With the building of Hoover Dam (and the history already mentioned in another comment) the local and state leaders saw the value of NOT outlawing gambling and prostitution as the rest of the country had/was in the process of and as they say, the rest is history.   I'm not a historian so forgive me if I missed something. If any of this interests you be sure to check out the Las Vegas Springs Preserve when you can. The NV State Museum is also there and they are both very educational.

vegas,3bwmfw,peeinmyblackeyes,3,Fri Jul 3 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, the town really got started when Senator Clark of Montana decided that this would be a great stopping point and repair depot for trains going between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles in 1902.   The ""Clark Townsite"" was roughly where downtown is today. In 1904, someone named McWilliams decided to build a competing townsite on the West side of the tracks. However, there was a problem getting water to this townsite. This problem was political rather than logistical. Not surprisingly, a mysterious fire overtook it. That area of town became ""West Las Vegas"" or ""Westside"". Clark of course became our County's namesake. Eventually segregation and forced moving of black owned businesses made Westside a predominantly African-American community. In fact, black performers on the Strip were obliged to stay in Westside until (of all people) Frank Sinatra put his foot down."

If it has a name on top of the door like it's a race car and a transformer's sticker on the window... It's a dumb mexican. If it's a champagne color camry, probably some 85 year old woman that has zero awareness of her surroundings doing 45 on the freeway.

vegas,3buhkk,Reduxy,14,Thu Jul 2 06:42:17 2015 UTC,"I go out. A lot. Both while single and now married. Most often single friends come with me. I have found, EXTENSIVELY, clubs are NOT  a good place to meet women unless you are extremely handsome, extremely rich and dress the part, and generally you will need both. The exception is with a lot of confidence and willingness to move on from a lost cause and a small sense of rejection to the next person, over and over, 1 out of the 100 people you talk to will show interest. Clubs are not the best of places to make an immediate first impression, it's loud and people there have a set agenda already.  There are a few exceptions. COUNTRY CLUBS have a unique agenda, to dance, with other people (2 - stepping doesn't go so well alone). Not to get guys to buy you drinks or rave alone in front of a DJ. And the music is generally at a bearable level to introduce yourself while waiting for the next song. On the other side of it women at them are very willing to help you learn the line dances and it shows you are wiling to try and don't care about looking ""dumb"", which is good cause you dont, it shows you have a sense of humor, confidence, and gives you the opportunity to smile and laugh when you mess up - things you should always be doing when making a first impression.  Better alternatives are scenarios that promote social interaction. Gambling tables, drinking games (beer pong at many of our local joints that have it), conventions of shared interests, dive bars, team sports, other forms of games (sports/board). Etc. Etc.  Our night clubs are just too pretentious. Not saying it can't happen (I've met a few cool chicks, albeit few and far between), but for the money you spend just to be there it's not worth it if you are looking to date. Totally worth it if going for the music or environment.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, stoney's, now Called The Bull, is the perfect place to meet people if you are able to approach strangers with a smile. Yes it's country, and I hate country, but it's a ton of fun and you can really let loose for low cost. It's a locals joint as well. Only good night's are thursday/saturday. Over the time I've spent in vegas I've always found it honestly difficult to leave that joint WITHOUT a few phone numbers on the nights listed. And even when I didn't I enjoyed my time dancing with many women, which leads to more confidence, and better results for next time.  On a side note. I know a lot of couples that have met there, and 4 that are now married. Good luck.  Source: a guy who has done all major clubs at least a few times, loves bars, and when single, loved to explore my options.  ADDED BONUS: if you are that nervous, you can always come out with us, to anywhere we may be headed. We go to the bull pretty frequently but now things are currently looking grim for it for awhile, revolver is still an option. My wife can even help you learn the dances. And I can be your wingman when approaching people."

vegas,3buhkk,cire1184,4,Sat Jul 4 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"Mmm as most people mentioned, don't try to meet a girl at a club unless looking for one night stand and you can face rejection well and move on immediately."
vegas,3buhkk,drfetusphd,3,Thu Jul 2 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"24 year old male here. I actually met my girlfriend at Drais a year ago and we're still going strong. It's not impossible, but it is hard to meet an approachable girl and even harder to get her interested in you in a club setting. As a single guy, you've got a lot of hurdles coming at you.  1: You're a single guy in a sea of single guys. Unless you're going to the club with a group of girls or have the money to pay for a spot in line, you're going to be looked upon negatively by the staff. And even once you're in the club, you're going to be inherently competing against the other single guys. Differentiate yourself from them. Dress well, look the part, act confidently, dance when you want to.  2: Women in clubs tend to be ""bitchy"" because they have to be. I'm assuming you're a nice, well-meaning guy but in a place like Vegas, a lot of the single guys are rude, pushy, or downright creepy. Some guys can't take no for an answer so women have to put up a giant barrier just to maintain their sanity or safety in the club. They'll go in groups, only hang out by the tables, or refuse any communication with you. It's a bummer, but you should just let it go if they say ""no"" from the get-go.  3: The atmosphere in a nightclub is not good for communication. There's going to be crowds, loud music, and lots of spilled drinks. If you're trying to find someone to date, I'd hang out outside or even in the line, talking to people. It's near impossible to do it while you're on the dance floor unless it's really small talk. I formally met my girlfriend at the lounge area in front of Drais so it was easy to approach her when we were already on the dance floor.  4: Money and access will help you if you have them. Girls, as much as I hate to admit it, will pay attention to guys who will buy them drinks or invite them to their tables. However, I stress that you shouldn't rely on this tactic because there are girls that will leave you as soon as you stop paying for their drinks or the table has no booze. I've had girl friends in my group who constantly admit to this. However, if you get a free table or free drink tickets or know staff members who can get you to VIP areas, by all means use them to make the first move.  I've been at clubs for 3 years and probably hooked up with 6 girls ever. Only 1 of them was ""date-worthy"" and we're about to celebrate our one year mark on Sunday. It's gonna be tough, but it's certainly possible. You just need to be smart, resilient, and most of all, HAVING FUN EVEN IF YOU WALK HOME EMPTY HANDED. I love EDM so even if I messed up badly, my favorite artists were always performing.  If I had to pick a good spot to check out, Marquee and Drais are good. Marquee is free on Mondays, last time I checked. If not, just ask around for a promoter."
vegas,3buhkk,mferg02,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Damn that's tough to do in the club. I love the fact that I'm married and so when I hit the clubs that is one aspect that I don't have to worry about. We have brought single friends with us though and me and my wife are really good ""wing men"" and usually girls feel safer to talk to a single friend if there is at least one girl in tour group. Good luck! And what drfetusphd said, even if you go home empty handed just enjoy yourself and enjoy the music! Don't be constantly on the prowl."
vegas,3buhkk,RichieSummers,2,Thu Jul 2 20:31:26 2015 UTC,I got you if you want to hit up any Vegas nightclubs on the strip. I've been in the scene for 4 years now and met the girl I'm going to marry. Its rare to meet good girls at these venues but not impossible. Hyde Bellagio has local mixers all the time and is a great venue as a lounge and nightclub.  -Richie LasVegasUnlocked.com
vegas,3buhkk,LVPCmod,2,Sat Jul 4 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"ex man whore here. Time to get you familiar.  Clubs.... should not be your ground for poaching pussy dude. As many have stated it takes no skill and almost always luck. I've seen a millionare hang out alone at his table like a dick and I've seen ugly dudes with a hot chick....  honestly my best advice is if you're gonna go to a club... do some research.. Do you like hip hop? do you dance to said hip hop music?  do you like EDM music and like to plur the fuck out?  go to a club that's gonna compliment your life style and your music choices so you feel more comfortable and more safe. Then, of course... dress nicely... Like... fitted jeans, dress shirt, vest and a blazer.  you can get away with semi fancy dress shoes or even converse to look a little more edgy and cool (clean them before you go, even though they'll get dirty as fuck).  and then just enjoy yourself man, let the music take control. Hit the dance floor man, bust your best fucking moves and maybe try dancing with a girl...  dude honestly like... I have money, drive a jaguar, I get tables, I pop bottles, pop collars and drop dollars, but none of that means shit... you just gotta do, say and be at the right place at the right time.   I met this beautiful girl once at a pool club... her belt buckle snatched up my jeans and she made a sexual comment... we joked around and flirted and talked like normal and enjoyed the music... got her number and the next few days we hooked up and went gambling and shit. Total luck, didn't resort to gimmicks, didn't talk money, religion or politics or any of that bullshit... just fucking kicked it and had a good time.  Met this other girl at a different pool party, she was my casual fuck buddy for some time... she was a Librarian... total babe, a few years older, but it didn't matter... this little doggy had a place to bury the bone.  and most recently I met this girl at the hard rock... we got a table at Hakkasan and I just danced the fucking night away, we laughed and joked and just looked at each other and we both mutually enjoyed the hip hop music together and the next day we went out to another club together, then I brought her home... I had zero intentions of getting fucking laid in all these instances... you gotta learn to have fun man. You gotta treat the club like she's an animal that needs to be tamed. Chicks can smell the thirst on a guy like a shark smells blood in the water.  I've met soooooooooo many girls at the club and I think I got as lucky as I did cause I went a lot... fuck I still go! goin' out this sunday to get fuckin' rekt again.... all luck dude. I ain't no fucking player or smooth talker... just a dude lookin' for a good time who knows how to have it.  also you're 22... meet chicks in college?"

However, there are locked fences both at the start of the road and then once you get closer to the towers.  If you want to HIKE, there are a couple of good hiking trails out there, like the Black Mountain trail can get you to the top of Black Mountain which is a great view of the city and the surrounding desert.

Think ""Dennys"" Vegas style, but a thousand times better. Good prices and great food. Try the fruit plate, and dont tell the locals I told you about this. Best buffet by far is the Bellagio.  another tip, nothing to do with food, but an amazing experience that many dont think about. Rent a convertible car from your hotel for a day. At 3am head out and drive to death Valey. You will get there at sunrise for the most amazing view of the sunrise coming down the whole valley, mountains painited with sunlight. The drive out is amazing too. Driving through the desert, wind in your hair, jammin some tunes and you can see what seems to be billions of stars. An amazing experience away from the strip.  Have fun!"
vegas,3bt2wq,CloNe817,2,Thu Jul 2 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"Here are some of my favorites:  Bartolotta  Its at the Wynn.  They fly their fish fresh multiple times a week from Italy with a GPS and temperature gague in each crate.  I recommend the Top Chef tasting menu and trying their Langostines.  The Top Chef menu includes their specialty, salt crusted fish which is carved table side.  I recommend reserving a table outside, but since you're going in July, you probably want to be inside but with a table by the window overlooking their amazing courtyard.    Yardbird  is in the Venitian.  It is a fairly new place but I've been there twice already.  Their service is amazing and the food is at a great price, especially for the quantity.  I recommend the fried chicken and waffles w/ watermelon, smoked bone marrow, BLT, frog legs.  Their beer, whiskey and cocktail selection is also pretty awesome.    L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon  is an awesome fine dining restaurant, especially if you don't quite want to spend the money at Joël Robuchon's main restaurant.  I recommend sitting at the bar as the kitchen is wide open and watching each chef at work is a show in itsself.  Also, you MUST get their mashed potatoes.  Even if you don't care much for them, they are AMAZING and worth it just for a bite, but I'm sure you'll want more than that!  Wicked Spoon is the place for brunch.  It is a buffet but their selection is AMAZING and they have a great champagne brunch.   These are a start, but let me know if you want any more recs.  Have an amazing trip.  Food is one of the many things Vegas does right!"

Kabuto is the best sushi at its price point (probably around 200/pp) available anywhere in the US, or at least it used to be -- I think the cost has been creeping up over the years, I haven't been recently. Raku in the same plaza is also very good, as is Monta Ramen.  If you like Thai, Lotus of Siam is probably the most famous Thai restaurant in the country with a stellar wine selection. Chada is more low key and is located in Chinatown.  It's hard to go wrong with steakhouses on the strip, but I am partial to CUT."

My rent is very comparable, and I basically take two steps out my backdoor and I hit my wall. Backyards in Vegas are generally small unless you're getting an older home or willing to pay $$$. Also, please note that temps get up to 110-115 in the summer. Please don't keep your dogs out in your backyard for too long.   I will say that Henderson is nice and family-oriented, but it's much more crowded than the Southwest part of the Valley and since your kids are grown it doesn't really matter about the family-oriented part. My only complaint about the Southwest is actually that it's not MORE crowded - it's a bit of a drive (10-15 for me) to get to any decent store, but hey, some people like that."

It's a bit humid here in the summer (ie now), neighborhoods can be quiet but there are a lot of people in the Henderson/Vegas area.  The school system is crap and much of North Las Vegas is too.  Your yard will probably be rocks as keeping a big lawn here is virtually impossible.  So those are the downsides, overall Las Vegas is pretty good for retirees but you won't be escaping city problems of Florida by moving here.

My aunt lives there, my mother has lived there for 5 years, and my wife grew up there.   Based on what you're looking for, I don't think you'll find it in the Las Vegas valley.   First, your budget is really low for the Henderson area, especially if a yard is important to you. Second, if you're looking for someplace less crowded than the Tampa Bay area, you're certainly looking in the wrong place. Tampa has a population density of 2,969.6/sq mi. Vegas has a population density of 4,298.1/sq mi. Tired of tourists? Vegas has 41 million of them a year.   Don't trick yourself into thinking that the tourists only bother Vegas and not Henderson. Henderson still has a population density of 2,514/sq mi (comparable to Clearwater, FL), and Vegas traffic easily backs up into Henderson on weekends.   I'm sorry if I'm misreading your post, but it just sounds like you're looking for a more laid back, less crowded place to live in. The Vegas Valley just isn't going to provide that for you.   You should really be looking in Texas or the midwest if you want smaller and laid back. Try looking into somewhere like Santa Fe."
vegas,3brgtg,mferg02,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"I guess the main reason why we are looking into the Vegas area is because of the weather.

I've lived in WI, KY, TN and TX and they are all the same to me.  We like Nevada because of the weather. It's hot not humid. It doesn't get extremely cold and it doesn't snow and hardly rains.

vegas,3bpg8s,scott60561,9,Wed Jul 1 02:35:04 2015 UTC,I'd come out there to catch my hometown Blackhawks---more so than any other city. I think they might be successful in drawing opposing team fans who are in town or want to have an excuse to go to Vegas.
vegas,3bpg8s,dtlv5813,-7,Wed Jul 1 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"So the stadium would be filled with opposing team fans? That can't be good for the home team. Personally I think it makes a lot more sense to try to get a NBA team here, who can really tap into the fan base that the rebels built up in its golden age."
vegas,3bpg8s,scott60561,4,Wed Jul 1 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think the Coyotes ownership would mind, they don't draw that much now. They were 28th in attendance and drew only 77.9% of available seats at home.   Source: http://espn.go.com/nhl/attendance  I don't think the sport matters either, Vegas is always going to draw out of towners to professional games.

vegas,3bpg8s,golfwithafrisbee,3,Wed Jul 1 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"I've never been to Arizona, but my understanding is that the Coyotes play in a stadium that is at least 10 miles or so away from the main downtown area in Phoenix. I think a team playing in the arena we have under construction here would draw in fans because of being located right next to the Strip and highway."
vegas,3bpg8s,SpikeMcAwesome,3,Wed Jul 1 02:46:56 2015 UTC,With traffic it's about an hour from downtown Phoenix. And the roads to get back to the highway are awful. Absolutely stupid move to put the team there.

vegas,3bsm8g,travelvice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"I did it from Florida,  but it's not fun. Some landlords and prop mgmt companies are still unprepared to deal with sight-unseen renters. Those that are willing and able to consider you have additional paperwork that needs to be signed if you or a proxy haven't viewed the location in any way, and of course a bonus if they have electronic lease signing.  I went through this last year for a house rental. You'll likely compete with locals who are able to give a money order for background applications in person, and be forced to overnight paperwork/payments to keep those folks from getting the prop you're interested in. Many don't have satisfactory or complete photos of the interior, assuming someone will simply visit the home for the complete snapshot. You're fortunate that you have someone in the area that can at least tell you if the home looks nice but smells bad.  I'd say simply be prepared for 20th century relator antics."
vegas,3bsm8g,travelvice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:16 2015 UTC,Doable. Lots of landlords want the realtors to show the place though. There are ways around that.  The only thing I would caution you on is to make sure you have a really good grasp on what neighborhood you want to live in. Just narrowing it to a part of town might leave you on a crappy street in a so-so neighborhood.

They start with the kids in the little slow cars and work up to the semi-pro stock car races. The waterless boat race is a blast and they close it with a good fireworks show.

Worst case you're out $20, best case they upgrade your room for the duration of your stay.   Most clerks will give back the money if they can't accommodate you.   Google it, there are websites devoted to it (and it has been heavily discussed on this sub if you search it)."

Know your limits and never push them. Once you get heatstroke, it is easier to get it again. Stay in shade as much as you can. Long sleeve cotton shirts are the best at cooling, so try to get 100% cotton t's. I don't use my A/C on the way to work. Only on the way home. Nothing sucks more than being nice and frosty, then having to get out into the heat for a shift. I take hot showers at home and it makes the room feel cooler since you are warmer than the air. I have two enduracool buffs that I alternate. You can find them at Lowe's. You will acclimate, but it takes a while."

If it were me, I would start monitoring flight costs right now to get a feel for what is reasonable.  Maybe plan to book in the next month or two, but I don't think I would wait past three months out.  Really tough to say.  Edit: This site recommends booking earlier for holiday travel."

(Assuming you don't do a non-refundable package or promo deal)  Flights are a different story, unless you're flying southwest, in which case you can book and then cancel and rebook (if you're using points with no penalty) or you can cancel and rebook and keep the difference in points to use on a future flight."
vegas,3bntoh,camaro2ss,2,Tue Jun 30 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"Southwest will refund you the difference if the price drops. It will either be in points/miles or a flight voucher for the amount, but if you plan to fly again with the year after a price drop it takes away some of the worry/concern."

vegas,3bou0e,VegasLoathing,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone who reads questions 3 & 4 will likely forget about 1 & 2.  Believe it or not: those are unusual questions on the Vegas subs.   Staying at the Cosmo, you have some great options without leaving the property.  However, it depends on your budget.  I would consider China Poblano and Holsteins to be great options.  You also have Jaleo (tapas can add up), secret pizza (cheap and good), and Wicked Spoon at your doorstep. I would probably point you toward a show.  Look for the half-price ticket booths (there's one across the street at Planet Hollywood).  Anything Cirque is good.  The best show on the strip is Absinthe, if you want to do it right (may not be available same-day).   3 & 4.  In case you're not familiar with local laws: prostitution is actually illegal in and around Las Vegas and Reno (and some other parts of Nevada).  The closest legal brothels are in Pahrump, which is around an hour from Las Vegas.  You can rent a car or some offer free limo pickups at your hotel.  Unfortunately, I'm not comfortable answering your specific questions, but there are many other resources on the internet for you.  Tipping the front desk $20 on check-in can have a big impact on the room you receive.  I've done this at Cosmo several times and it works.  Try to get anything with a fountain view.  You are right across the street from my favorite casino: Planet Hollywood.  In the evenings, they open the Pleasure Pit, with very attractive, scantly clad dealers.  If you are planning to gamble, head over there."

If you can request to get inside for your shoot, the Smith Center is beautiful art-deco classic style.  But that pipe art installation outside the Smith Center would make a pretty colorful background too.  Another indoor place could be the Mob Museum?

Note: This isn't your standard MGM room - there are only 14 of them.   We specifically chose this suite to host a party because our MGM host recommended it because he said we could play loud music (as there are in-wall and in-ceiling speakers throughout the suite) without disturbing other guests. Of course there's also the 800 square foot outdoor terrace, where you can make as much noise as you want - we actually had a band performing outside (there are built-in speakers on the terrace too, but we actually brought in our own sound equipment)."

vegas,3biczs,StaticGuard,5,Mon Jun 29 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"Most of the casinos on the strip and downtown have a rental car desk.  However, some are hit-and-miss.  I've had good experiences (Cosmopolitan) and horrible experiences (The Plaza).  If you want to be sure, I recommend renting from an airport location (I don't take a chance anymore).  The Airport Hertz has some luxury vehicles (Mercedes, Porsche, Land Rover), which can make these trips more fun.  The Hoover Dam is a great day trip and worth the time.  There's only one route and it's a straight shot (you wont get lost).  Take some tours and just wander for a while.  It's amazing.  The Grand Canyon is much more difficult.  The South Rim is an unforgettable experience and worth an overnight trip (at least one night).  However, it's not realistic for a day trip.  I strongly recommend you plan a separate trip around the South Rim.  The alternative is the Western Rim, which is still impressive, but not in the same league as the South Rim.  It's 2.5 hours from The Strip and the Hoover Dam is on the way.  This is where you will find the Skywalk and some other Native American facilities.  Keep in mind: most of these have separate costs and some (the Skywalk) are fairly expensive."
vegas,3biczs,SurlyQueue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"We were thinking about leaving the strip at around 7:30, stopping by the Hoover Dam to take a few pics, then heading to the South Rim. Figure we'd get there around 1pm which will give us a few hours around there, then back to Vegas before midnight.  How much time do you really need at the South Rim to enjoy it?"
vegas,3biczs,SurlyQueue,2,Mon Jun 29 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"While your timeline is possible, I really think you are short-changing both experiences.  There is a lot to see and do at the South Rim, including several museums, the Desert View Watchtower, dozens of trails, tours, etc.  You're also looking at 8 hours of travel time for a 4 hour experience.  My first visit to the canyon was a short one: arriving after 5:00pm and leaving at noon the next day.  I very much regretted it.  I felt there was much I had missed.   Logistically, your timeline is sound.  However, my best recommendation is still to do the dam and schedule a trip to the canyon for when you can dedicate more time."
vegas,3biczs,MaxTheDog90210,2,Mon Jun 29 18:41:34 2015 UTC,Don't be like the German tourists.  1) Take bottled water. 2) Tell somebody which route you are taking.

vegas,3biczs,LVOgre,2,Mon Jun 29 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, you're not really going to get the full experience if you try both in a day.  If you're just going to stop at the dam, snap a few pictures, and head back out, then you'll do fine. If you're looking at tours and want to visit the museum, you won't have time.  The trip to the South Rim (the place you want to go, don't do West Rim, it's a sham), then you've got 8-9 hours of driving ahead of you. You'll want at least a few hours at Grand Canyon to take in the sites and history.  Conversely, if you just want to snap a few pictures from the rim and head out at the Grand Canyon, you could do a dam tour. I can't imagine driving that far for a picture, though."
vegas,3biczs,LVOgre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:42:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd rather spend the most amount of time at the Canyon. Thanks.
vegas,3biczs,drakk0n,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:21:08 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider, Hoover Dam opens at 0900. If you get there right at opening, snap a pic, then leave, you're looking at being on the South Rim sometime after 1300.   3 hours at Grand Canyon, return the car... You're getting back to the hotel room between 9-10 when you figure in meals.  If you can do Grand Canyon one day, then take a few hours one morning to do Hoover Dam. Renting a car for this would be the cheapest option. Bus tours start at $40 per person, a limo is probably cheaper than a bus for 5 or more."
vegas,3biczs,keystone66,4,Mon Jun 29 23:48:05 2015 UTC,Unless you get the car first thing in the morning and then only visit each place for like 5 minutes there is no way you will make it to the Grand Canyon and back in a day. The trip to the south rim is at least 4 and a half hours - the only way to truly see all its glory. You could go to the skywalk which is a bit shorter of a drive but that's not really the canyon imho.
vegas,3biczs,drakk0n,8,Mon Jun 29 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"A day trip to south rim is totally doable. In fact it's a pretty standard thing when I have guests who want to do some tourist stuff that doesn't involve the strip.   Typical day is leave Vegas at 5:00 am, get to the g.c. around 8:45-9, hit the overlook by the visitors center, head down to bright angel and hike down to the first building and back up. That typically puts us at like 4:00 in the afternoon, add another 4 hours drive home and you're back in Vegas around 8:00. It's a long day but definitely something well in the realm of reason."
vegas,3biczs,keystone66,-1,Mon Jun 29 16:42:16 2015 UTC,Yeah but the OP said rent a car - If you rent a car the desk doesn't open till 8am and closes around 6pm....doubt you would make those hours :P
vegas,3biczs,ruhbluhbluh,5,Mon Jun 29 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"So you rent from a 24 hour place, get the car the night before at 10 or 11 and drop it off before your 24 hours are up..."
vegas,3biczs,scottsteg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"Dollar rental is great. I booked with them before arriving (a bus picks you up at the airport and takes you to the rental centre) and was into the car within an hour. Was cheap too.  Hoover dam is a good hour and a half, worth seeing at least. There's only one route there and it's pretty straight forward. Get lots of water, sunscreen and bring hats and sunglasses. I didn't go to the canyon because it was too late in the day to make a 4 hour trip. Hoover dam has a helicopter ride for $39 too..."
vegas,3biczs,peeinmyblackeyes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"If you go to Hoover Dam, they have multiple walking tours inside the dam. Some are quick while others are like several hours of going deep inside the stairs and such. You can also just park and walk it.   I like the bridge that spans the dam that was built not too long ago and despite it being named after two US heroes, I simply call it the ""America, Fuck Yeah! Bridge""  Finally, Boulder City makes a nice stopover for some food. There's a local brewpub there (Boulder Dam Brewery) that has some good beers onsite with decent food. The beer is better than the food IMHO."
vegas,3biczs,peeinmyblackeyes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"Search this sub for all the GC day trip info you could ever want. As far as times I would leave at first light (5ish) as it is a 4+ hour drive.   It's very doable and if you want to see the dam stop at the bridge walkway for the best view. You'll be set back about 30 minutes if you don't fuck off but short of the tours it's the best way to see it (and free!). You take the dam turn off and stop at the bridge walkway parking lot.   When I day tripped it with my son it was perfect, we stayed to watch the sun go down and were back around 1am."

I'll just add two quick notes in case you haven't made that drive before:   The highway will, at times, become Main Street in small towns like Alamo and Caliente.  Watch your speed. There's a pizza place in Caliente which might be my favorite pizza place in the state.  Not sure why it's so good, but I love it.  Check Yelp for the info.

Its either on the way or 2 minutes out your way depending on which way you take to get to Ely. Or if you have more time to burn take the 375 down to Rachael and check out the Area 51 touristy stuff.   Ely also has a railroad museum that is supposed to be good but I have never been myself.

Almost every strip casino has their own in addition to about 10 wedding chapels on Las Vegas Blvd (mainly south of Mandalay Bay and north of Stratosphere). Might be a good idea to call now and make your reservations. The Marriage License office in Las Vegas is open 365 days of the year (201 E Clark Ave. Las Vegas, NV 89101) from 8am to midnight. If you go on a weekend, I'd advise to come early during the day to avoid long waits. If you get in town during a weekday, go then.

After a certain point in age and duration of the relationship, we often get asked when we marry. The reason we dont is due to the tax system in Switzerland. It does not favour marriage ;-).   Since the US marriage is not valid in our country. At least not without considerable extra effort in form of paperwork, we decided to marry in Vegas and let our families know we that we are now married."

I would just say make sure to look up how you go about getting a marriage license here in Vegas and also call the place where they issue them to make sure they'll be open when you're here (some govt places might be closed on the third since sometimes when a holiday falls on a weekend, they close that Friday or Monday). Of course you might not even need one since you are visiting from another country. I'm not quite sure how that kind of stuff works."

My advice would be to book a hotel as far out as possible (ie. now), as you can cancel most reservations within 48-72 hours of the reservation date with no penalty."
vegas,3bkbli,camaro2ss,2,Tue Jun 30 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"I have found that three nights is the sweet spot.  I would not bother with a shorter trip.  You can stay longer, but you'll want to consider some off-strip activities.  Hotels will be more expensive during Spring Break, but you should still be able to find some good options.  The Linq is the best kept secret on the strip.  Good property, good rooms, good pool, and great location.  Rooms normally go for ~$100 mid week and ~$170 weekends.  Expect those rates to increase up to 50% over spring break.  Total cost just depends on your activities.  Vegas can cater to any budget.  There's hot dog restaurants and pizza-by-the-slice right next door to super-fancy steakhouses and french restaurants.  You shouldn't have trouble staying in a budget, especially if you're not gambling."

If you don't, stay downtown or west of the airport - you save a fortune. Prices go up during spring break. Prices off-strip, not so much. Spring is a great time to go see Red Rock or other outdoor destinations. During summer, when most people actually visit, it's instant death.  The farther out you go for food, the better the deals. Basically everything in Chinatown is great and reasonably priced.  Get a reservation for the restaurant on the Stratosphere waaaaaaay in advance.

As for storing energy, that's a separate aspect from generating electricity. Most systems installed (unless you're totally off grid and out in the wilderness) today are generating only, and don't store.  $10k is not enough to buy a solar system that will produce a significant amount unless you have all low voltage and high efficiency appliances in your house, including your air conditioner."

vegas,3bg4l1,jrshaul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:06:40 2015 UTC,You can have any solar company analyze your usage and rate schedule to see if you'd save anything.  But because your rates are so low (only $.12 / kWh) I doubt it will make sense for you.  And unless your usage is low $10k won't eliminate your bill.

vegas,3bg4l1,IrishDemon,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:49:12 2015 UTC,"I think Solar City can install them for free but you do not get to keep any of the energy stored at the end of the month. You can use it but it will not carry on to the next month. The left over energy is sold to California.   My brother told me about solar city, i suggest you do your own research about it. This is all from what i heard, as for the accuracy of the info i give you is uncertain. I could be wrong."
vegas,3bg4l1,J-DawgDBZ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"OP should FOR SURE do their own research. Solar City is basically a huge scam where you enter into contract (potentially a contract which can end up costing you, A LOT, but it's a low risk gamble in sense) and then they sell you the energy at a lower rate than NV energy does. They say they are not allowed to get your home past 90% efficiency, but in reality may get it up much higher and just never let you know while selling the extra electricity off for quite a bit more to other companies. Last time I looked into their company I was looking at saving on average $18 a month in electricity bills for the first few years, it may or may not increase for later years depending on the climb rate of NV Energy. Save $18 a month at the cost of FREE ? Sounds GREAT! Right!? Possibly, possibly really really bad, you are in contract for 30 years to keep their equipment on your home, after so many years you are able to purchase all the equipment for yourself at ""their face value"" which will probably be incredibly over priced as every decade solar technology becomes quite a bit dated. Breaking contract is basically like breaking your bank, and if you ever go to 'sell or rent' your home the next owner or tenant MUST agree to solar city's terms, potentially making your home much harder to sell/rent (some people don't like the idea of the eye-sore or the fact they are going to have 2 power bills), leading into a force break of contract - COSTLY. It's a very low risk factor, and if you are SURE you'll be in the same home for the next 30 years, it's a pretty sweet deal, but on that small off chance that life happens, well, enjoy your additional $10,000 of debt, all to save what ? 18-50 bucks a month... yeah the math is no good there... If it was good they would not be installing systems onto people's homes and maintaining them for the price of ""FREE"". Even if they could save you $50 a month (that's the HIGH END of their savings if your your an extreme power user and they can get your home to their max efficiency), you would still have to have their system on your home for 16+ years to get past the contract breach fine in order for it be worth it. Do you know where you will be in 16 years?  On top of all that, THEY get to claim the ~30% IRS rebate for the price of your system install. Not you, and at that point you can never on that home. So let's say in the future you want to just install your own system on your home at ~30k, you are eligible (as of this current year and the past few) to claim that on taxes and get around ~9k back in taxes. Essentially making a very effective system that can lower your power bill to damn near nothing around 21k. Even at 21k total out of pocket expenses, if your average power bill is $200/mo, it would still take you 8.75 YEARS to break even, that's assuming no maintenance on your system is ever required. You would need even a higher average usage and a 100%+ effective system to see any monetary returns before that.  They are stealing YOUR IRS rebate, and then charging you for the electricity, albeit at a slightly lower rate than NV Energy, but... bleh. If you just purchase the system yourself, even though it will still take on average 8-10 years before you start seeing ""free energy"", at least your home value actually increased by the roughly the amount you spent on the system. So in a round about way by spending ~30k for a system, getting a ~9k rebate, and your home value going up ~30k, you just gave yourself ~9,000 dollars in an instant, and free energy in a decade."
vegas,3bg4l1,TKGK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm defending Solar City in any way, shape, or form, but some of your info isn't accurate. Some of it is, but that doesn't justify the inaccuracies.   Also, your bias about the rebates is a problem. I think you're looking at this the wrong way. Solar City isn't stealing your rebate. A homeowner using Solar City to install a system isn't spending any money. You haven't bought anything. What you're doing is leasing them roof space and agreeing to buy the electricity the system generates. They own and maintain the system, not the homeowner. There is no theft involved when clearly it wasn't the homeowner's to begin with. You're giving up the rights to the rebate when you agree to lease Solar City the roof space - how else can they sell you electricity at a reduced rate while the homeowner contributes nothing monetarily? Remember what mama always said, you can't get something for nothing, and if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  As for getting your money's worth out of the investment that is residential solar... You're absolutely right - it takes years, sometimes more than a decade to see any sort of substantial or quantifiable return. Even more so for houses that weren't ever designed with solar or even high efficiency appliances in mind. The best you can hope to do with an existing house and today's level of technology without doing a major remodel is to partially decrease your monthly electrical bill. The problem is that most people don't want or have the ability to spend $30k or more to reduce their monthly electric bill, and might be better off spending that money on a high end HVAC system or better insulating the house."
vegas,3bg4l1,IrishDemon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"You described the system very well. I'm with you on every thing you said. I feel it's a manner of ""Internet miscommunication"". No they do not own the home owner but in a very big way you are "" in debt"" to them with the contact method. If you wish to sell, or lease/rent your home, the next people in there have to take over (utilize) the equipment on your home or else the contract is broken and you are responsible for a very hefty fine. One that if generally you haven't had the system for a very long time time you are screwed. This goes back to the ""very low risk gamble"" I mention. Most prospects will be okay with a slightly lower power bill but in the small case some are not, especially in a purchase environment where the owner plans on installing a solar themselves, you are a shit out of luck without encrueing a very large debt. For every month your house isn't rented or sold you have set yourself back YEARS :(     (on the electrics savings aspects that is, a $50 saving per month compared to a $1000 mortgage you are paying with no one living in the property)  I honestly feel we agree on the subject. Just terminology and wording may have been off. At the end of the day, in all aspects it's better to purchase your own system than to use solar city."

There are various reporting times which begin at 7:30 AM, so you won't know if or when to report until you make that call.   I know this sucks, but it's because they won't know how many jurors they need until the last minute. Plea deals and dropped charges happen all the time. In fact, I was already sitting with a batch of 80 jurors ready to be interviewed when this happened. I will never know if that was the actual case, but the timing makes it seem likely.   If you do go, be sure to park at the Fremont Experience garage and walk to the courthouse from there; the court will validate your parking.  Good luck, and may you not have to go."

You'll see a flow of people going so it'll be hard to miss. You show up along with 300 or so people and everyone gets a number. They do a roll call. People get picked in batches of forty or so to go for interviewing. Once they have their jurors people that are left over get sent home but even then you don't leave until 12 or so.

vegas,3bb9e3,PokerBoySwag,2,Sat Jun 27 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"Craps is my game (well, aside from the sports book). The number one thing to remember is that, if you want to maximize your return mathematically, is to put most of your money on the odds.  The 3$ tables that have 10x odds are a safe bet. You should always be playing your odds up to the table limit. 3$ at 10x... You should be throwing 30$ on that every time.  That's the only issue with the electronic craps, it's 5x odds which is why it's not as viable as the tables. It's still fun though, so I play it at Santa Fe a bit.  Come bets are really good too, as they're just another avenue to make pass line and odds bets. I'll usually have at least 3 pass line bets (by way of the pass line and a couple come bets) at max odds. It's a volatile way to play though. There will be a lot of up and down that you'll have to ride out.  Craps is the best game to play hands down. Especially if you're maximizing your return, but even if you're not it's still a pretty decent value game to play. It gets easier and easier the more you play.  Edit: almost forgot! The Jokers Wild in Henderson had a 1$ craps table as recently as a year or so ago. Haven't been since. If anything it's probably 2$ now. Great way to learn and play at a slower pace."

Like one 7 am session at a locals casino and play an empty table. You can go at your own pace and the dealers will likely be really helpful since you're keeping them not bored to death. That's how I learned. And if you're a poker player, you'll pick up craps easy."

vegas,3bb9e3,chrisk702,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:34:27 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks for the update.  Do they payout the same as other Casionos? Like are the payout odds the same?
vegas,3bb9e3,tp99,-2,Sun Jun 28 18:59:25 2015 UTC,Odds don't help you at all.  They just increase your variance.  So there's no reason to take full odds except to gamble more.
vegas,3bb9e3,chrisk702,2,Sat Jun 27 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"Odds pay better than place bets, and aren't long shot bets like the rest of the table. How does that not help?  If you have a 5$ pass line with 50$ odds on, say, the 4 or 10, you're risking 55$ to profit 105$. If that's a place bet you're risking 55$ to profit 99$.  It's a small difference, but over time it adds up, and if you get into larger amounts it makes a more pronounced difference."
vegas,3bb9e3,tp99,-2,Sat Jun 27 23:20:51 2015 UTC,That's not the question.  $5 pass line bet with $50 odds is not better than $5 pass line bet with no odds.  In fact it is usually worse because of the variance.  But that's gambling.
vegas,3bb9e3,chrisk702,2,Sun Jun 28 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"....? Pass line pays 1:1. Odds pay either 2:1, 3:2 or 6:5. That's not ""variance"", that's simply a better return. I'm failing to find your point here, unless that point is simply not to gamble at all. Which is not really the point of this conversation."
vegas,3bb9e3,tp99,-3,Sun Jun 28 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"It's OK, most craps players don't understand.  That's why they feel the need to take full odds."

I'd like to understand if there is something I'm missing, but I don't see how taking even money when you're eligible to win more than that is possibly optimal. Otherwise you're trolling me in a pretty boring fashion."
vegas,3bb9e3,tp99,-2,Sun Jun 28 02:52:37 2015 UTC,Odds bet is better than pass line.  But full odds isn't better than no odds.  It's the same.
vegas,3bb9e3,exceptyourewrong,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:29:35 2015 UTC,"But a $5 pass line bet with $50 odds IS better than a $55 pass line bet with no odds. The likelihood of winning is the same, but the bet with odds pays out more for the same amount risked."
vegas,3bb9e3,Chipware,-2,Mon Jun 29 09:22:14 2015 UTC,Of course.  All I'm saying is a $5 bet with no odds is the same as a $5 bet with full odds.  There's no reason to bet $50 odds.  It's the same whether you do or don't.
vegas,3bb9e3,Chipware,2,Mon Jun 29 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"You're really confused, man. The only reason to play a pass line bet is so that you can place an odds bet, which is the only bet in the casino that has no house edge. The reason to play full odds is so more of your money will pay out that higher amount if you win.   If you play a $5  pass line bet, with no odds you're missing the point of a pass line bet. If you only take 1x odds ($5 pass line and $5 odds) you're only getting a good payout on 50% of your money, but that's still better than a $10 pass line bet. If you take 10x odds ($5 pass line and $50 odds) you're getting the good payout on more than 90% of your money.  I'm guessing you just don't want to be betting $50+ dollars a roll, which is fine, but don't fool yourself into thinking your bet on the pass line is as good as your odds bet. It isn't."
vegas,3bb9e3,kornkid42,2,Mon Jun 29 17:19:24 2015 UTC,I play at Sam's Town.  They have one of the best tables in town with their $3 pass line bet and 20x odds.  Weekends they bump the minimum up to $5 but that's fine by me.  I also love the 1-1-1 bet at the first come out roll because if they hit all 11 numbers without rolling a 7 it pays $245 and I hit it once ever 3-4 times I play.  Generally a cool casino and the Friday night crab/steak buffet is worth the $20 price of admission.

I go to the same gym as a couple of girls who work as cocktail waitresses on the Strip and they look like fitness models and all get teeth whitening, lash extensions, mani/pedi's, and tans regularly. Nearly all of them have breast implants and they're extremely vigilant against weight gain because their work uniforms are extremely skimpy and/or form-fitting. Try looking on social media to see what the cocktail girls and bartenders look like at the top clubs or even the Hooters and Twin Peaks here. If you need to, start working on getting in shape now.

The trick is finding what percentage of the value of the vehicle they will lend (90% Loan to value for example).

Because each one adds the possibility of noise, they are often not hooked up unless they will be used.    On my place in LV, this box is on the side of my house.  In my mom's in Henderson it's in a wall in her closet, so you'll have to look around to find it.  Open it up and make sure the cable you want to use is plugged in.  In some cases you may have a small splitter that doesn't allow for all cables to be hooked up at once and you'll have to choose which or go down to Lowes and get a bigger one for a few bucks."

It may be either in your master bedrooms closet if it's a newer house, or on the side of your house, outside wall.  Editing this since you're using a separate TV provider.

Call or check out Century Link's best deal (don't worry, you don't want it, nor will you get it).  Call up Cox and don't say a word about the problem.  Just say you want to cancel your service.  The first person will ask you why, you don't want them, just ask nicely to transfer you to the department that does cancellations (retention department, but don't say that).  When they do, tell the person that you want to cancel your service.  They'll ask why and tell them, ""I've been offered a good deal with Century Link but my biggest issue is you guys want me to pay to use a different coaxial outlet in my house for my cable modem.  They may try to tell you something bad about Century Link, you just say that's fine.  Then they'll finally tell you that they'll do it for free.  This works for so many different things.  Worst case scenario the person is a dick and won't budge but tell them you want to cancel and if they say ok, hang up and call back.  It's never taken me more than two calls to get what I want.  In fact, I have premium internet for $40 a month because every time something went wrong, I did this.

vegas,3b8ch2,pokerTA12,2,Fri Jun 26 20:02:38 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if you'll like my advice or not..  I've only played online all my life and still new to live (haven't even played with real chips yet)  I played a few low buy in tournaments at the Plaza downtown.  Real fun.  They use electronic tables so it's like playing online and live at the same time.    They also have low buy ins all over the place if you check the Poker Atlas app on your phone assuming you have a smartphone.  I heard that Planet Hollywood has some good $80 tourneys that I might try out.      I'm basically in the same position as you just a few years older.  Good luck! =)
vegas,3b8ch2,PokerBoySwag,2,Fri Jun 26 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with the PH poker tourneys is the rake. They take one of the highest percentages of the prize pool of any casino. Caesar's is way better in that respect. I don't remember the exact percentages, but PH takes like 17% and Caesar's is more like 7%."
vegas,3b8ch2,pissclamato,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Ohh ok thanks for the info. I just read somewhere earlier that PH had a $80 buy in $1,500 guaranteed tournament.  Sounded good.  So Caesar's is better then?"
vegas,3b8ch2,PokerBoySwag,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Caesar's tournaments, as a rule, have long blind levels, small blind increases, and if they even have antes at any point, it's late into the tourney. PH is like a turbo tourney: fun if you want to kill four hours, but hardly profitable in the long run.  tl,dr: If you want fun, go PH. If you want money, go to Caesar's."
vegas,3b8ch2,pissclamato,2,Mon Jun 29 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to find a tournament. Lots of places have daily $60 buy-ins, with a re-buy of $60 if you bust within the first hour. It's a lot of fun, the drinks are free, and it won't break your bank. Great place to learn and have fun -- I prefer those over cash games because it's cheaper.   Also, for the first hour, fold pretty much everything but face cards unless you're the big blind and no one reraises before the flop. Bluffing is an art, you'll get the hang of it eventually, but if you're new, watch everyone else, you'll start picking up stuff. Playing conservatively you can last a couple hours without rebuying, pretty economical way to get the most out of going to the casino."

South Point, any Station, and Orleans will be filled with the crusty old nits who are only there to drink coffee and win high hand or bad beat jackpots.  Definitely go to the WSOP.  Even if you don't play a hand, the atmosphere and the insanity is worth checking out for sure.  The biggest rule of the table is this:  Don't slow the game down.  Pay attention to when it's your turn to act, your turn to post blinds, etc.  You can take your time to make a decision, but don't act like ESPN has cameras all up in your grill for every move you have to make.    Ask the dealers about anything else if you have questions.  They can help with about anything you want to know.  Sometimes their hands are tied, like they can't tell you how much a raise is unless it's your turn to act, for example.  That's about it.  Have fun."

Edit: be prepared to buy in for $100 for 4-8 fixed and $200 for 2-5 NL as a minimum. Go to have fun and don't expect to win. Don't play every hand, you will lose quickly. I would suggest grabbing a book and at least looking at what they suggest your starting hand ranges should be.   I often prey on people just like you who don't know the intricacies of the game. But I've also seen new a walk out with racks of chips. Over everything else, just have fun! Good luck!  Edit 2: Live poker is very quiet. Not a lot of talking or excitement.

vegas,3b6xil,IrishDemon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:46:01 2015 UTC,"the thought is ""we already have a resort that is 70% complete. why don't we address that before we start something new""    a reasonable thought, although somewhat irrational.  i'd love to see something done with the Fountainbleau before we build new, but i also understand that no one wants the bad juju associated with it."
vegas,3b6xil,gitismatt,2,Sat Jun 27 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"Packer started the Fontainebleau but couldn't finish it due to cost overrun and poor project management. The property went into default and Icahn took control by buying up its debt at a massive discount.  Instead of littering the strip with yet another construction site he needs to clean up his last mess first-- I hope the county makes that a pre-condition before issuing this guy any more building permits.  P.S anyone looking for a good hotel deal downtown should look into the Plaza. They renovated all their rooms with furnishings from the Fontainebleau, which Icahn sold off for scraps."
vegas,3b6xil,dtlv5813,3,Sat Jun 27 01:58:28 2015 UTC,Not quite sure how he can clean up the mess when he's not involved with the property anymore.
vegas,3b6xil,IrishDemon,2,Sat Jun 27 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"As someone who's been inside of Fontainebleau recently,  that 70% number might be a bit high.  The Fontainebleau site is 24.5 acres with 3889 rooms in a single tower,  while the proposed Alon site is 35 acres with 1100 rooms spread over two towers. The two properties aren't really a direct comparison.  If by bad juju you mean one to one and a half billion (or more) dollars just to finish the Fontainebleau not including acquiring it, then yeah, that's bad juju. Add to that the as yet to start arena to the north, the SLS not turning a profit, the north festival lot for MGM/Rock N Rio also not turning a profit, and the Riviera coming down soon, the Fontainebleau site is a harder sell compared to the old Frontier location directly across from the Wynn and Encore and closer to the more active part of the strip."

Not that it's a bad area (I lived there for 3 years and commuted close to where you'll be working), but Jones/Rainbow are kind of a mess with everyone leaving Coronado and Mountain's Edge.    Specifically about the Resort at Coronado Ranch - I went to look for an apartment there a while back.  It's a guard-gated community, so I told the guard I was going to talk to the leasing office about prices, etc.  He said he would call to let them know I was coming and opened the gate.  I drove through, and as soon as I walked in the leasing office, the person running it basically attacked me ""YOU CAN'T JUST DRIVE ON TO THE PROPERTY WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE GUARD!!  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE GUARD!!""  After I explained he opened the gate to let me through, she wouldn't let it go and just kept screaming.  I told her to fuck off, left, and rented at Cantera at Coronado Ranch (two blocks west of the Resorts - Rainbow and Robindale).  Aside from the parking being inadequate, I fucking loved it."

Great management, and I loved my apartment and complex.  BUT: Don't limit yourself to apartments though. I very recently moved due to needing to get out of a bad roommate situation, and was pleasantly surprised at how much cheaper it was to get a big, gorgeous condo (looked at townhomes too). My 2bd condo is cheaper than some 'average' 1/2bd apartments, including my old place!  PM me if you want more info on camden or my new condo (for reference) or a great realtor's name :)  good luck!!"
vegas,3b7n48,ShortWoman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:58:46 2015 UTC,Camden seems like a great option except for that mandatory $92 technology fee. I don't watch cable so it seems like a waste.

vegas,3b7n48,deademery,2,Mon Jun 29 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"If you're planning on working near Sahara and Rainbow, don't even consider Green Valley Ranch. Too far away, with a perpetual traffic jam on 215 westbound near I-15. I'm not sure what you consider ""South"" Las Vegas. Decatur and 215 maybe? I certainly wouldn't consider anything further South than Rhodes Ranch.  A lot of people love Summerlin. It was designed to be likable. You will pay extra for that. It's also very homogenized. If you gotta do Summerlin, there are some complexes with gates to check out near Fort Apache and Sahara. That would be 5 minutes to work, and just down the street from the new mall (now I'm curious... thinking through businesses around Rainbow/Sahara).  I like Spring Valley. I'm 10-15 minutes away from that intersection during rush hour, assuming I hit every [REDACTED] light on Rainbow. It's 5 minutes to a hospital, 5 minutes to Chinatown, 10 minutes to the Strip, 15 minutes to McCarran, ~45 minutes to Mount Charleston.   In an ideal world you'd have a few days to visit before making a decision, but I know this isn't an ideal world.  Welcome to Vegas! Good luck!"

You can easily take a cab to MGM or Mandalay and check things out for a bit. It's going to be morning so it won't be crazy, but you can definitely check things out.   If your flight leaves at 1:30 I'd recommend leaving the strip at about 11 or 11:30 to get back to the airport with enough time. That gives you about 3 hours to explore.

vegas,3b2szf,carecher,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, take it from an expert at layovers(I travel at least 2 times a month) Start now, book a super shuttle as someone else said. It's about $15 I believe. The taxi will run around $25 so it's up to you. (I have a lot of vegas layovers) Go to Mandalay Bay and have a cocktail and gamble OR go to Bellagio (with a taxi this will probably be around $30..try the shuttle again) and take a few snaps of the scenery around the hotel-Paris' Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains are right there- Go inside the hotel and check out the garden. Have a gelato or drink and gamble a bit. The reason I said OR is because you can't go to more than one spot..it's a tiny strip but the traffic is ridiculous.  If you choose the Bellagio area, you can see about 2 or 3 hotels if you move quickly. Remember you'll have luggage. I'm assuming you will be taking a carry on?  Since it's early morning, maybe go to Planet Hollywood-across from Bellagio- and have a verrrryyyy cheap and hearty breakfast at La Salsa Cantina($3.99!!) in the Miracle Mile Shops. Then head over to Paris for a crepe or coffee. or Stay at PH and get a drink for $10 at Fat Tuesday..get a vegas buzz early in the morning since it's acceptable here!  So here's the thing-either you go to Mandalay Bay which is closest to the airport, and you don't really get to leave.. or go further to Bellagio/PH/Paris and get to see a few sights and get good food/drinks.   Leaving the strip- you can't just hail a cab like in NYC so you'll need to go to the front of the hotels where valet is. There will be a line for taxis. Takes about 15 minutes to get to the hotel from the PH area..that's if it's a weekday. If your flight is departing at exactly 1:30, be at the airport no later than 12:45. That's 15-20 minutes for security and then you're set. It shouldn't be too crowded..  You'll have plenty of time! The airport isn't huge so you won't be wasting time walking out. Just be quick and plan ahead of time. Also, the casino in Paris is great for getting free drinks as you play the slots.. sit near the bar and you'll get at least 4 drinks in within half an hour. Tip since it's free."

You'll be lucky to see him by 11am.   Who does that to paying customers?!  Both my girlfriend and I experienced on multiple occasions this phenomenon.    Oh, it gets better...ready?  On several occasions when my girlfriend went there to obtain her ADD medication (yes, she really has bad ADD, and no she does not abuse it) the good Dr. recommended that she get a lady-parts exam, too!

The wait was a little long but the front assured me I would still be seen, I walked in because I was sick. I had to use the restroom when I was there and apparently took the long way, walking passed what I could only assume was the doctors office when I glanced in I saw a computer monitor filled with different views of the office, what caught my attention was the angle of one of those screen shots, the camera seemed to be angled directly at a female patient.

See what's available and what you might be qualified for. I personally would try and secure employment before moving here. Even if you have a lot of money saved up, it's unpredictable how long it might take once you arrive here.   Where you live will probably depend on where you work. Assuming you work on or near the strip, your best bets are south summerlin (Russell and ft Apache area), or anywhere south of 215, east of Las Vegas blvd, north of st rose, and west of Gibson. That box includes some really nice areas (green valley) as well as some more affordable apartment complexes.   Your expenses will vary depending on the size of your house or apartment. Most utilities are fairly cheap, but obviously electric is very high in the summer.   Pros of living here: weather. Most things are open 24 hours. There is always something going on and always something to do. Plenty of nature and outdoor activities. No state income tax.   Cons of living here: tourists. People can be flighty. Everything is largely dependent on who you know. Going somewhere outside of LV requires a flight or a decent drive. The drivers are terrible. Smoking indoors is acceptable and common.

vegas,3ayfb7,TheoremOrPostulate,9,Fri Jun 26 06:09:05 2015 UTC,Love hearing this.  I became obsessed with moving to Vegas a few months ago for many of the reasons you've outlined here.  Good to know it holds up in practice.
vegas,3ayfb7,SurlyQueue,8,Wed Jun 24 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"You're right! It's an amazing city that has so much to offer. In the few years I've been here, Vegas has diversified culturally (Smith Centre, more performing arts), in IT (downtown startup boom, new IT companies moving in) and in education (new school programs being offered at both CSN and UNLV).    You mention the wildlife, and I have to underline the fact that the sunsets over the mountains here are always an amazing sight. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who loves this town!"
vegas,3ayfb7,purrattack,5,Wed Jun 24 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"in IT (downtown startup boom, new IT companies moving in)   In all fairness the tech ecosystem in Vegas is still quite small and limited in depth and breath of talents. There have also been a few high profile flops: e.g. Shift, Moveline. Many companies and software developers are still very much hesitant about moving here. Tony Hsieh and Vegas Tech Fund helped to attract a number of companies here but they have since stopped seeding new startups.  Still Vegas has come a long way in the last few years. There were much lamentations when Romotive left Vegas for SF after raising $6.5m. Since then, however, a number of local tech startups have raised/made way more money than that. Banjo just closed a $100m round which garnered a lot of attention. If a few other startups can follow suit with similar big ground then we may just get the critical mass we need to be taken seriously. Realistically speaking Vegas will probably never become like the bay area, or NYC/Boston/Seattle, but I can certainly see the sin city becoming a regional tech hub on par with Portland or even Austin."
vegas,3ayfb7,dtlv5813,2,Wed Jun 24 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input, I was sad to see Romotive leave. I'm definitely seeing LV becoming a regional tech hub.

vegas,3ayfb7,gitismatt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"Higher education is definitely the weak link here.

Compare to Portland and Austin which have  large top notch research universities (U Oregon and especially U T Austin which has one of the top ranked computer science programs in the U.S, not to mention other universities in the area ) that feed skilled workers into the local economy.   Still the few UNLV computer science majors i have met are all competent, and we have been tapping into the talent base in SoCal."

vegas,3ayfb7,nineteennaughty3,2,Wed Jun 24 19:34:30 2015 UTC,"I lived in Fort Lauderdale before moving here, about 30 miles north of Miami. Everything /u/jkrjjrs said about the weather is spot on. The weather in Florida is a murky ass-pit of doom. I LOVE the weather in Vegas. It is so much more palatable than the humid swamp that is south Florida.   While I love the ocean with all of my heart, I like that here I can go outside and exercise (walk, run, hike, bike) for a much longer part of the year. Summer in south Florida lasts from February to November. Then it cools down for December and January to the mid-70's during the day.   Speaking of which, the lack of seasons is a major mind-fuck. There's hot and then 2 months of pleasant. There's no fall, winter, or spring.  The cost of living there was stupid. Now, granted, I lived near-ish the ocean, but I paid more money there for my tiny 1 bedroom apartment than I pay here for a 3 bedroom house. Food was more expensive because shipping down there isn't cost effective. Gas was super expensive.  And the people in southern Florida.. ugh! The snowbirds and the people on permanent vacation and the tourists. At least most of the tourists here stay in a mostly centralized location."
vegas,3ayfb7,littlebittykittyone,2,Thu Jun 25 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"It seems as if everyone else that has responded completely agrees with you lol. But we also get only 2 seasons. Granted we get a way longer ""nice"" season that that."
vegas,3ayfb7,nineteennaughty3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"We actually have all four seasons. We get a month or two of cold, followed by several months of pleasant, then doom, then pleasant again, and then the cycle repeats.   Florida was doom, then two months of pleasant, then doom again. It was never cold. I never turned my heater on the entire two years I lived there. The a/c ran for 10 months straight though!"
vegas,3ayfb7,littlebittykittyone,2,Thu Jun 25 08:03:18 2015 UTC,"I've never lived in Florida, but I stayed in Biloxi, Mississippi for 7 months. Right on the coast, about 100 miles away from the panhandle. 1st big difference: Humidity. Jesus! I lived in Vegas for over 10 years and would take 110 dry over 90 humid. People always laugh at the ""Oh, it's a dry heat"" thing, but god did I not know how true it was til I left the desert. There's this thing called heat index. You may know it as ""feels like"" temperature. Well, that raises with moisture in the air. I've literally walked in 110 degree weather in Vegas and not sweated a drop. It hits 80 on the gulf coast and you'll be leaking like a water hose. Science: When sweat evaporates it cools you down. More science: Moisture only evaporates when the air is dry enough to take more water into it. So when the air is at near 100% humidity for 4 months straight, you're pretty much not gonna get cooled down. Remember that heat index thing? Well 110 at 20% humidity (Vegas) feels like 112. 90 at 90% humidity (gulf coast) feels like 122. So here's the kicker: That 112 in Vegas is a little more bearable because your sweat will cool you off as it evaporates. But that 122 on the gulf coast... your sweat's not evaporating, so you just have to deal with it. Full force. And there are days where it reaches 100 and 100% humidity! That's 195 heat index! Never, never, never will I live on the gulf coast again. Ever. I'll take 125 in Vegas any day before I ever take 195 again. And that's just one aspect of the weather. It rains and thunderstorms every day in the summer down there. It's called ""Air mass"". Meaning nearly every afternoon for 4 months you're getting drenched with hot, muggy swamp piss. I hated it. And that's not to mention the hurricanes, tornadoes, hail... it even snowed and freezing rained there a couple winters ago. It's not fun. Plus the people have weird accents, they dress different, they use different slang, they have a different style of cars, houses, and general architecture. It's like a different planet. A different planet that sucks. Hardcore. The only upside is the southern food. Best I've ever had. But that's all they're good at making. There's nowhere near as many asians, hispanics, or middle easterns, so their foreign restaurants are sub par. We're talking billy joe bob making your burritos. Not auténtico. So, honestly, people always say to travel the world to expand your horizons. But I've seen the south... and that's enough traveling for me. (If you can't tell, I feel really strongly about this topic.)"

Being in Vegas is the only time I ever feel clean.  And there's no bugs!  Holy Christ, the bugs here in Louisiana...  One step in the desert and I knew it's where I was destined to be.

My impression has always been that comp nights (and other perks) are a function of regular gambling over a long period of time (months or a year).  The idea that someone could sit at a table, play $20/hand, and be given comped rooms is something I have never experienced or seen.

But we're about a block or two away from Las Vegas Blvd.  There's no way of really maximizing chances really. It's all based on your loss. When we pull up your account, we can see every penny you put into a slot/poker machine. With table play, they take your average hand and do some math with how long you've been sitting at the table and come up with your play that way. Everything is recorded.   After you play, give it a month or two, and especially if you're from out of town, you'll get brochures and stuff with your free or discounted play/room/food & beverage credit.  For the resort I work at, you could call us at anytime (I deal with comp rooms/VIP reservations specifically) and you could give us your player number. We enter it into the system and we can offer discounted/comp rooms depending on your level of play. If it's comp or discounted, depends on the prevailing rate for that specific night. If you are a decent player, you might get a free room if the rate is $50-$70 per night. If the room is $300+ per night, you might get a discounted $175 rate hypothetically."

vegas,3ayd7m,gitismatt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"that's not entirely accurate.  i stopped playing at a casino for about a year.  the first time i went back after my hiatus, i lost $200 in slots.  when i went online and checked my rate calendar, most of the low and mid level hotels were free during the week and very discounted on the weekends.    i got that casino's card when i turned 21 so i have a decent history with them, but by taking a year long break i was able to start fresh so to speak.  so it IS possible to get decent comps from one day's play, but like /u/thatcaveman said, it's all based on your specific situation"
vegas,3ayd7m,thatcaveman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"ADT is based on the play for that whole day, so it's possible to get comped playing $20 hands but you'd have to play for a bit and lose a lot. If you play really strong throughout that one day, it's possible to get comped right then and there if a casino host contacts you. I'm not sure about all casinos, but for ours when you check out, you can check out at our VIP check in area and they can assess your play and take X amount off your hotel bill."
vegas,3ayd7m,thatcaveman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"Promo's for new sign ups change constantly between resorts, so you won't get an exact answer here. Most of the locals casinos off the strip usually do promotions with free stuff and slot play for new sign ups and daily play."

You could also check out the non-gaming properties like Vdara, Mandarin Oriental, or Trump (which is surprisingly affordable, due to its location).  If you are intent on staying off strip, look at Red Rock Resort (far west of the strip) or Green Valley Ranch (south southwest, in Henderson)."

vegas,3ayusu,awesometographer,2,Wed Jun 24 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, there are two other purposes: it's something that can be waived for people with status at that casino (a manufactured perk), and it's something you can charge lower level players who received a comped room (the room's free, but it's $30/nt for the resort fee).  The big problem is: since everyone does it, none of the properties can stop doing it without putting themselves at a disadvantage.  If one casino stops resort fees and increases their room rate, their rooms will suddenly appear $30 more expensive than their competition, even though it's the same rate in the end.  By the way, if you ask the property, they will say it's for the newspaper, internet, and fitness center."

vegas,3axv6d,AgentCC,3,Wed Jun 24 11:13:11 2015 UTC,"Having gone through the Alternative Route to Licensure program through CCSD, I feel qualified to answer a few things.  Yes,  they are in desperate need of teachers,  with a projected shortfall of over a thousand teachers this fall.  The program I went through its pay off a program to remedy this gap,  moving non-education majors into  roles  after a few weeks of training and a pedagogy class at one of the local universities.   At the time when I took the class, they were only doing this for the areas of highest need: science, English, math, and special education. So unfortunately, history is not included in those, or at least it wasn't when I went to the program. that being said, I have a friend who has a Masters in history and currently teaches English. the program doesn't stop once you start teaching, you still need to take some where like 15 credit hours of pedagogy classes, in order to transform your temporary, 3 year arl license into a full license. until you actually teach in the ccsd for 3 years and complete those courses, you will not have a full license to teach.  Personally,  I quit after my second year,  as I want happy with the career path. You've been teaching for a while,  so you should be fine,  just stay on top of whatever requirements they ask of you.  Once I'm on my phone I'll attach some relevant links that should help you get started. Good luck!"
vegas,3axv6d,KronosTheBear,2,Wed Jun 24 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, check out the Alternative Routes to Licensure (http://teachvegas.ccsd.net/teaching/alternative-routes-to-licensure/). You should be able to get in fairly quickly when you pay your fees and crap.   What do you really want to do? Teach? I taught English overseas for a year. Were you actually doing it to teach because you enjoy teaching and they don't give a shit what kind of degree you have or were you doing it to get drunk, travel, save money, experience a new culture, etc?   I sure as hell wouldn't want to teach for a living and I definitely wouldn't want to do it in a state that doesn't give a flying fuck about education. But hey, that's just me.   I highly doubt you could get a job at a local paper without a portfolio or writing samples, ESPECIALLY since your undergrad degree isn't relevant to that field.   I really advise against any higher degree in a liberal arts field unless you already have an established career and getting the advanced degree will get you a promotion. From the research I've done (and trust me, I've done a lot...English major here) it isn't worth the time or money the majority of the time. And if you just want to be a teacher, don't bother with the advanced degree. It isn't necessary (unless you want to make a somewhat decent salary, but that's kind of a different topic..)  If you think you'll like teaching, I think the ARL program is your best bet."

You see them every day, you don't want to see them when you go to the grocery store or park. Draw a circle about a mile and a half to two miles radius from your school. Inside the circle is your no-go zone.  If you can find a house over an apartment, do it. But pay attention to the neighbors, and stop by the place on several different days at different times so you get a feel for the community. We looked at a great place in Henderson but were turned off by the neighbors after we saw them working on their el camino in the street at 9:00 at night.

(I know I sound a little like an old grumpy person, but just laying it all out). The community management was fine, didn't have any problems with them. The layout of the apartment we had was pretty good, and the attached garages are a nice feature too, especially given the summer heat etc. Location is probably the best part, there's a lot of great stuff in the area."

vegas,3au1r4,fiwer,2,Tue Jun 23 18:28:06 2015 UTC,If you're moving to Spring Valley Summerlin may be a bit too expensive and to far out for you. Honestly the Southwest area is one of the nicest and most affordable areas in town (anything south of Flamingo and west of Durango is considered southwest. My friend rents a 1 bedroom condo with attached garage near Sunset and Ft. Apache for around $700 and its really nice.

I would utilize a realtor if I were you, there services are free to you as they receive a cut of the monthly rent that you pay to the condo owners."

vegas,3au1r4,furledeyebrow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:02:21 2015 UTC,Spring valley is not a bad place to live. You can also head south of the 215 or by the lakes and have less of a commute.  A realtor would be able to work with you and find something in your bugdet.
vegas,3au1r4,MisterDu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:54:03 2015 UTC,I live in a pretty sweet house with 4 beds and a pool in Spring Valley on trop and tenaya for 1250. The area isn't bad at all but I've personally had a hard time finding people that aren't trashy or stupid. Not sure if it's the same in summerlin. Basically it's kinda shitty around 15 but as you get further away the housing gets more expensive but cleaner. Just keep searching for something until you get the best deal possible.
vegas,3au1r4,squeel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"I just moved out of Spring Valley about 2 months ago.  Regardless of some people's experience, there's a lot wrong with Spring Valley. Crime rates have been increasing dramatically. There have been drive by shootings, robberies, thefts, muggings, and a lot of violent crimes in the past few years. The neighborhood around rainbow and Flamingo is simply awful, and has gone downhill fast since it was bought up by Chinese investors who rent the houses and don't maintain their properties.  It's not the entire neigborhood, but you should avoid the area East of Buffalo, and North of  Hacienda. Try to get as far from that area as you can. The rot in that area is going to start spreading West, depreciating property values and making the neighborhoods unsafe. So I wouldn't buy anything, or plant long term roots anywhere East of Durango."

vegas,3aq3py,MrsSoundGuy,6,Mon Jun 22 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's on Eastgate just south of Warm Springs. All separate businesses but all in the same complex. Walking distance! I work for Bad Beat Brewing. Come by and check us out.   You can go take a tour of the Distillery and try all of their awesome spirits then walk over to Bad Beat and have some beers. We have a sample flight of all of our 6 year round beers and whatever seasonal beers we have. Then literally just diagonal of us is Crafthaus brewery. They offer flights of their beers as well. We are both taprooms. Not bars. Smoke free environment with no video poker machines anywhere. Bad Beat and Crafthaus have totally different beers and different ambiance.   Then there is Grape Expectations, a wine making school. BUT with the new laws changing to allow wineries in Clark County they might actually become a winery with a tasting room.   There was also supposed to be another brewery opening in the same complex called Vegas Brewing Co. but it hasn't happened yet. It's been pushed back for over a year now...  Also there's usually a food truck parked in the middle of the two breweries thurs-sat. Or you can always bring your own food in.   I do believe the distillery has been planning on making a tasting room as well where you can go and hang out and try their spirits and have cocktails. But that hasn't happened yet.   That's the booze district. In due time I believe it'll be an even better place with the wine laws changing and if the distillery gets a tasting room. Local beer, spirits, and wine, plus food trucks all in one spot.   Shameless plug... We (bad beat brewing) are having our ONE year anniversary Saturday July 11th at 3pm. It's going to be HUGE. We have a bourbon barrel (from Las Vegas distillery) aged Imperial Breakfast stout brewed with local coffee from Mothership coffee. A Belgian golden strong ale aged in Chardonnay barrels, an Imperial IPA and 4 different firkins that day. Plus a big party in the whole brewery. Giant jenga, cornhole, food truck.

It was a pretty disorganized meeting of about 35 people, of which we were by far the youngest (both of us are in our 30's).  Half the people were really cool older people that I liked a lot, the other half were old and complained about things the whole time.  Some dude brought some mangoes, they were bomb.  Haven't been to any since, not really my thing.  I guess I like to be either alone or in smaller groups when hiking."

Surprisingly, nearly every other place in town has a bar dedicated to a specific team/region - except Boston.  The Pats fans were meeting at the Aces and Ales on Tenaya and Cheyenne, but now meet at some shitty PT's on the east side of town.  I'm stuck trying to find another place to watch the games."

vegas,3aqfmo,chrishamer09,6,Mon Jun 22 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Your buy-in is only one factor of how you are rated at table games.  The floorman also monitors your bet size and how long you play.  $200 over zero play will earn you zero points.  This is why the dealer lets the floor know when someone cashes out.  Also, this is why the floorman will occasionally look over the table during play.  They are checking bet sizes and ensuring everyone is still playing."

vegas,3aqfmo,camaro2ss,2,Mon Jun 22 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"What surly said. Casinos don't rate you on your buy-in, otherwise people would do exactly just what you said. You could buy in for a million bucks or 10 bucks, all they care about is your average bet and how long you're at the table. Higher bet + longer time = higher average payout for the casino."

vegas,3amrkg,J-DawgDBZ,3,Sun Jun 21 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"Replace the whole unit is my advice. Parts are more expensive than a whole unit. My brother and father are both techs, 800 dollars more for a unit is worth it.   My brother works for one hour A/C and they charge almost three times as that for a unit. You have a great price already, I'd suggest you take it."
vegas,3amrkg,IrishDemon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:12:51 2015 UTC,"One Hour is grossly expensive. When a new unit costs $1700ish wholesale, and a crane runs $100-200, and the startup tech is another $100, charging $7000+ is ridiculous."
vegas,3amrkg,J-DawgDBZ,-1,Mon Jun 22 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"They're the best in vegas at the moment, you're paying for warranties, maintenance, and memberships."
vegas,3amrkg,IrishDemon,5,Mon Jun 22 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"Membership for what? Maintenance on what - blowing out the leaves and washing the coil down once a year? Oh, and while we're here, can we interest you in this electrostatic air filtration system? It's only 400% above retail and the benefit from having it is slim to none! And unless you get a lemon compressor that fails within 90 days, chances are it'll go until at least the end of the 5 year warranty. In all fairness, One Hour will show up on or before the time they commit to, but when someone straight faced looks at me and says it'll be over $2000 for a high pressure switch and refrigerant, and the refrigerant is roughly half of that at retail cost, it's hard for me to be respectful. Take me on a date and shove a few drinks down my throat before you try and stick that traffic cone in my ass."
vegas,3amrkg,J-DawgDBZ,-2,Mon Jun 22 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking out your frustration out on me instead of one hour. Calm down man.   Refrigerant is at it's highest in years, so take that in consideration. The reason it costs more than retail is because they are a business, if you sell at retail you'd break even. If you don't want to pay them, it doesn't matter to them because they'll take out a lease on your home and eventually own your home. The warranty are usually all free (even the labor) except refrigerant, you want to know why? People used to recycle it and resell it and then use their warranty to get more for free. If you want just the unit installed with no warranty then you'd get close to your retail price. So youd end up with a unit with no warranty, and youd have to pay again when it breaks or if it comes faulty.   ""Take me on a date and shove a few drinks down my throat before you try and stick that traffic cone in my ass."" if you want that to really happen, then go to yes man. They are worse."
vegas,3amrkg,IrishDemon,3,Mon Jun 22 01:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not frustrated with you at all, just responding to your claim with personal experience of my own. This happened a few years ago, and the price One Hour quoted me to fix my 11 year old unit was not only more than what I paid for it in 2002, it was also more than buying a brand new unit that day with a warranty and refrigerant. I'm all for a company making a fair profit, but markups in the thousands of percent are not fair.  Did you mean mechanics lien instead of lease?  Only if I authorized them to do the work and then decided not to pay. Once the tech gave me the estimate, I declined."
vegas,3amrkg,J-DawgDBZ,-1,Mon Jun 22 02:29:37 2015 UTC,I understand.  Well if you do the work then decline pay.

vegas,3amrkg,GoPronto,2,Sun Jun 21 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yelp reviews are mostly bought.  I wouldn't pay much attention to them.  The one with the highest rating is likely the highest bidder.  Not only that, they allow bad reviews to be taken off by paying a fee.  Fuck Yelp."

I personally write Yelp reviews and they are sometimes negative and sometimes positive and mostly they do show up on the front page.    But, it's why I always recommend multiple quotes for any job over a couple grand.  No better way to feel someone out than to have them in your house with the smell of money in the air.  :)"

Get the make and model of the unit, locate exactly where the duct work is and what size it is, and find a new unit with the same or very similar dimensions.   I put a new 5 ton unit on my roof when I remodeled it and spent less on the unit than I did on the union made duct work - under $1900 for the unit and $2400 for the internally lined custom duct work (shallow pitched roof in a 50's house)."

Honestly reselling a gaming rig is nearly impossible without drastically reducing the price.

If you can get $600, I would jump on it before they read some of the other replies in here.

The Governmental Services Tax penalty is $6.00 or 10%, whichever is greater (including Supplemental Governmental Services Taxes in applicable counties). Contact us for an exact quote if needed.""  Getting the ticket dropped depends on the jurisdiction. (Las Vegas Muni, Las Vegas Justice Court, Hendo Justice Court, etc).  Good luck"

I personally didn't have that problem. People always come up to me and talk. Have my guitar? People ask me to play a song. Walking my dog? They talk about their dog. Wearing a shirt with a comic or show character? People always bring it up. People are extremely social to me, here.   I mean, drugs aren't nearly as bad here as small towns my wife and I have been in.   People are actually decent drivers, with obvious exceptions. I remember being in Seattle and everyone honks nonstop for everything. People are quiet here.   This is a 24/7 town. 8pm on a Sunday and I'm hungry? It's easy to find a place to eat. 2pm on Sunday somewhere else? Psh, everything is already closed. Ice seen Target stores close early afternoon on Sundays in many places.   Flooding is no longer a problem here. No earth quakes. No tsunamis. No hurricanes. We just get heat once in a while and we live in a part of the country that's new enough to have built in air conditioning units instead of places like in the east or in Europe.   Bands always come here, too! Touring bands want to stop in Vegas and usually do so on the weekend when it's easy for me to go. It's great to hear a band you like is on tour because they're practically guaranteed to see you.   I love the landscape here. Desert is awesome because it's unique. Many places have huge forests and mountains. Few places have great desert scenery.   I mean, like every other city, there's a bad part of town with higher crime. It happens. I can't think of a single town I've been in that doesn't have that."

vegas,3aj1m2,alexisaacs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"Vegas is just more condensed, which is part of why I love it. I loved having 4-5 Walmarts and Targets within a 15 minute drive. I loved that the best entertainment in the world, despite being ""on the other side of town"" was still a 15-20 minute drive away.  I live in Phoenix now, and to visit my dad who lives in the same city, I have to drive 30-45 min... and it's not even on the opposite side, just opposite sides of the center (like the vegas/henderson border to Fremont Street)  But because Vegas is so condensed, the difference between glorious Vegas and Stabby McStabberville is literally a few steps.  I also really wish the Strip would be classed up a bit, get rid of those pathetic porn-card-dipshits, and clean up the cesspool of the human equivalent of shit that exists around it.  Also, the city kind of started going to hell when the recession hit. All the construction that ceased, how far UNLV has gone down... it's more sad than anything.  I miss many aspects of the city (24/7 bars and clubs, and Kabob Express which is the best Kabobs in the fucking USA), but I really look forward to seeing Tempe/Scottsdale flourish in the next few decades."

When I moved here, I called about 4 or 5 prior to moving and set up appointments to go to once I was here. Appleone in Henderson was the first place I had an appointment with, and they placed me within a week, which included an interview. As long as you can make a good impression, communicate with them, and aren't super picky, they are really good.   My friend got laid off from his restaurant job, moved to LA for almost a year, came back and had a job within a couple weeks.   Yes, there isn't a lot of jobs here, but if you aren't above working for a little bit less money since you can supplement with poker like my friend does, there are options. Since I've moved here I've run into a lot of people who complain that there aren't any jobs, and the reality is that they just aren't willing to work a little harder, or take slightly less money to be employed, rather than being unemployed and complaining about their situation. Cost of living here isn't high either, which helps take a slightly lower paying job not hurt as bad."

vegas,3afbbe,SirSoliloquy,24,Fri Jun 19 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"They are a horrible airline, absolutely terrible.  I took them once because it was the least expensive option at the time.   As a frequent traveler I had not encountered staff that is so outwardly hostile towards their clients, this included gate agents, air hosts and even their corporate 1 800 number people.    From soup to nuts every interaction I had with their company representatives was negative.  I'm not surprised they abandoned thier customers without remorse.  Hopefully this will gain more attention and discourage future clients."
vegas,3afbbe,airbert,9,Fri Jun 19 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"discourage future clients.   It won't.  For most of the Spirit clientele, budget trumps other considerations such as customer service, flight times, fleet age, etc.  Not judging, just saying."
vegas,3afbbe,dispatch00,9,Fri Jun 19 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Spirit's management realized early on how important it is to be the first line in a search result grid, with the lowest official ticket price.  I think they copied RyanAir from Ireland.  In 2013, Spirit had 30% more customer complaints than any other US carrier.  They were also the most profitable, per flight (basically they had the fewest unsold seats).  People say they want good customer service, but they clearly choose low prices and bad customer service.  See: Wal Mart."
vegas,3afbbe,Big_Baby_Jesus_,4,Sat Jun 20 05:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do show up as the cheapest option, however they nickle and dime you for everything, and penalize you for not following their strict rules.  It SEEMS like the least expensive option, but after all the additional fees, it can be more expensive than booking a flight with a reputable carrier.  I read the same thing, that they are a copy of RyanAir, which I haven't flown on, and refuse to do so.  I'd rather pay a little extra for the reduced hassle, and piece of mind.  A while back I took a Delta flight cross country and had to switch planes in Atlanta.  When I arrived, there was some issue.  Delta booked me a flight on American that got me home two hours faster than the Delta flight would have.    That was great service, I'll pay a bit more for that, instead of being stranded in an airport for days."
vegas,3afbbe,airbert,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:24:18 2015 UTC,"If you fly Spirit more than once, it's pretty much because you don't give a fuck.  Fool me once, shame on me... Fool me twice..."
vegas,3afbbe,fahque650,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"I've flow both spirit and Ryan air multiple times. The main difference between the two is the spirit air is at least totally transparent with their fees. Ryan air on the other hand lays traps for you at the airport to trick you into paying fees. You think spirit is bad, they're angels compared to Ryan air."
vegas,3afbbe,ArbitrageurD,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"I thought. It was a given that spirit was better known for their prices than service, ffs, you have to pay for water.

vegas,3afbbe,PunchFatCops,8,Fri Jun 19 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  I can't fault people for being frugal.  I DO fault people for having expectations that a ""ultra-low-fare"" airline won't have more problems and shittier service than one that is more expensive."
vegas,3afbbe,dispatch00,6,Fri Jun 19 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"shittier service, sure. lack of comfort, no bells and whistles, sure. but even frugal people should be able to expect to be transported in some fashion to their destination on the approximate day they scheduled the trip."
vegas,3afbbe,frowny_ponts,2,Fri Jun 19 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"To an extent...  Spirit customers are used to the service they used to get on United, Continental, Delta, Northwest, etc.  Maybe the amentities weren't the greatest, but what they were good at was getting people to their destination in a decent timeframe.... Because they are so massive and had so many planes going to every destination that re-booking people wasn't as big of a headache..  For an airline like Spirit which is about as barebones as they get, one or two flights a day on most routes, no spare airplanes- I see exactly how this happens."
vegas,3afbbe,fahque650,3,Sat Jun 20 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"Allegiant is usually as cheap as Spirit and has the same no-frill services but they are much better with punctuality, customer service etc. especially through the unauthorized strike early April.

vegas,3afbbe,dtlv5813,2,Fri Jun 19 23:34:46 2015 UTC,I love allegiant. I used to fly Southwest regally until they suddenly stopped being a low cost carrier. The only difference I feel on allegiant from southwest is the seats are not as comfortable.

Huge malls, like the Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood, the Forum Shops at Caesars, Fashion Show Mall, etc are around to check out with interesting shops (The Linq alley by the ferris wheel definitely has some quirky kind of shops that are good for a cheap laugh). Walking around casinos like Bellagio, The Wynn, and Venetian are a treat since a lot of work is put into the atmosphere and feels a little more high end.  Since you don't have a car, here's a couple of links for some free transportation on and off the strip. There are a few free monorails you can take advantage of to travel between casinos (but only on the west side of the strip, on the east of the strip is a single big monorail that you have to pay for), and some shuttles that will take you off the strip to some sister casinos and back.  http://www.vegas.com/transportation/las-vegas-monorails/ http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/free-shuttle.php"

For starter, we already have the monorail, can simply connect it to the airport on one end and downtown the other--it already goes to Sahara. Now if only we can knock some common senses into the politicians."

Hop on here and it goes straight to Union Station in LA (it doesnt make a bunch of stops and has always been on time).  At Union Station you can then get on the city train system and it is super simple to get to the beach or anywhere else in the area.

I'm originally from Sacramento and the first time I had Pizza Rock was back in 2011 or so before I had moved to Las Vegas. My first thought was ""This feels like a place that I'd expect to be in Las Vegas"" mainly because it was so avant garde. And then two years later, after I moved here, Pizza Rock opens up 2 blocks away from my apartment."

Also on eastern there's a wood burning joint called novcento. You get to custom make your pizza and then they cook it in the oven for you. Takes about 90 seconds. Pizzas are on the small side though but delicious. I like grimaldis better

Now, they were able to say that keeping the tax money allowed for lower rates which is not saying much as they charge the highest rates of their division, but if they do pay taxes, they could increase the rates and say they need the money.

Most of the schools are filled with violence, gangs, drugs, and kids who generally don't give a fuck. The magnet schools are only decent because of their program, which, mind you, still will expose your children to the normal majority of the school filled with the people I just described. Henderson is a lot better, with Green Valley HS being one of the better ones. A-tech is the #1 school in the state and is nationally recognized and also in Vegas, but they're extremely selective and pretty much want the kid with the 4.0 GPA throughout the entire middle school years with something else really unique about them (talent, extra curriculars, etc) Palo Verde H.S. and the summerlin area is great but also pretty expensive.

vegas,3a80oq,theduke282,2,Fri Jun 19 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"TLDR; I personally wouldn't do this; we moved from Vegas specifically because of our kids.  In the writing of this, I can't believe now some of the shit that happened while we lived there, haha.  People can and do raise their kids in Vegas.  I have friends still in Vegas raising their kids.  I wouldn't say it's a family friendly city, though the city is making huge improvements that do help.  Realistically, locals that aren't young/single/club-going types stay off the strip unless they are there to work.  I had quite a few friends in Vegas who never went on the strip, and we didn't either.  We did go to Silverton a ton, with the kids, to go eat or go see the Aquarium.    When it came down to it, we left because:   The school system was rough.  We were lucky to get into a highly-demanded charter school the first year it opened, but didn't know what we would do when high school came around.  The waiting list for the school (Doral Academy) is insane.  If you do go to Vegas, I recommend trying to get your kids in there.  Maybe you'll get lucky, but realistically, you probably won't.  We had friends who tried 3 years to get in and couldn't.  We had the best odds because we tried to get in the first year, and even then we barely got in. Speaking of high school, our Vegas native friends told us ALL ABOUT how they would sneak into casinos at night to try to drink and hang out.  Even after curfew.. Drinking and drugs.  EVERYWHERE.  And there's no shame or even attempts to hide it, seriously.  We used to eat at this place called 3 Tomatoes and a Mozzarella.  Yummy place but it always reeked of weed.  Not super family friendly ;)  Meth junkies were everywhere.  Fremont street is just straight up scary as hell.  I cannot even believe tourists take their kids there.  We watched Mr. T and his hooker army get into a fight with Iron Man over panhandling turf one time.  A++  People are flashing their tits out there, and hookers are lining the street looking for action.  I can't even imagine how much pickpocketing is going on down there, too, but I digress. There is no neighborly love in Vegas.  Everyone drives into their garage and closes the garage door before they can even exit the car.  If you have neighbors.  In two of our three houses, one of our neighbors was always foreclosed and the house was vacant.  I'm not even joking when I tell you that one of our neighbors died of a meth overdose and no one knew for 2 days.  My mom had come to visit and we were going to go eat (actually, we were going to 3 Tomatoes and a Mozzarella) and we couldn't leave because our street was taped off as a crime scene. No kids playing outside together.  Not even a chance, really.  We had 3 houses, in all of them we rarely saw kids playing outside, and it wasn't even all that safe to do so anyway.  There's postage stamp sized front yards and no sidewalks, and the houses practically sit on the street.  If you move there, prepare to become a huge fan of the pre-arranged playdate.  There are nice parks, though, if you don't walk into one (Western Trails) for another child's birthday party and go into the bathroom to find blood all over the floor and a used condom.   Edited to Add:  We lived in Rhodes Ranch and Mountain's Edge, by the way.  It's not like we lived in a slum.. they were nice neighborhoods that were actually geared more toward kids, at least."
vegas,3a80oq,tedistkrieg,3,Mon Jun 22 14:07:51 2015 UTC,"If you're focusing on schools at all, even a little bit, don't move here. Just don't. This isn't somewhere ""nice"" - and no, Henderson (just a few miles away) isn't either.   There's little for the kids to do, especially in the summertime. There's no sense of community. Neighbors don't look after one another. In recent years, local police departments have often been more of a risk to citizens than a benefit- I'm not saying there aren't any amazing law enforcement officers here, I am saying that those less-than-noble ones have damaged the reputation of local  departments.   We have some of the worst schools in the nation. Please look it up. There's no reason to choose a state that can't get its shit together, especially when it comes to children. I'm reminded, Department of Children and Family Services/ Child Protective Services are taking steps....in the wrong direction.

At the end of your journey, you come to a large dino jumpy and play area for the kids, where of course, you have to pay extra for most of the activities. If your kid actually wants to learn and is interested in dinosaurs, which my sister really is, then it's probably just a huge waste of time and money, you're better off taking them to the Discovery Children's Museum."

I count myself fortunate to know him and work closely under his adroit leadership. Some of you who have been with the company long enough had opportunity to engage with him and come to know him.   In his 98 years, Kirk Kerkorian probably did more, while receiving less attention than anyone else in Las Vegas history. He worked for the betterment of our city, our industry, and our company.   I wish more of you, especially our younger employees, had opportunity to know him as some of us did. He was a wonderful man. He did not carry himself as the giant of our industry that he was, but conducted himself humbly, allowing his hard work and keen insights to speak for him. He worked his magic quietly, effectively, and without fanfare.   While accepting a loss is always difficult, I know Mr. Kerkorian would not want us to mourn. So as we reflect on his life and accomplishments in the in the coming days, I will choose to celebrate his life – his unassuming nature and his many contributions.   If more of us would choose to lead our lives in the manner he did, we would live in a far better world.   Sincerely,  Jim Murren"

vegas,3a2twr,erinn1986,3,Tue Jun 16 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"Hi! I recently took a statistics class on regression. I may be able to help you, but be warned 5 patients is not a big enough sample size for to make claims about a population. Sure, you can analyze it and maybe make a case for further research, but your sample is not representative of a population and your sample may or may not be unbiased, depending on your methods.  If you want to make claims about a population you first need to define the population you want to make claims about. Is it all the people in the US, is it males in Las Vegas, etc. You make the assumption that the population is normally distributed.  Your sample must also be normally distributed, if the population is normal then you need to pull enough observations from the sample for the sample to follow the central limit theorem, else you have a high chance of having an unusual sample (aka not normal aka not representative of the population being sampled). Think of it this way: if you have 10 numbers in a hat and pick a number and then put it back, you have a relatively high chance of picking the same number over and over. If you have 1500 numbers, the chances of picking the same number 5 times in a row become a lot smaller. Basically, if you have a big enough sample, then the small quirks of your sample become less significant and you can focus on what you're trying to measure.  Also, your methods need to be unbiased. How did you select the participants? Did you pick the participants out of a hat or just take 5 people you know? Do all these people work out or is there a random mix of people that work out and people that don't? The list goes on and on, and this part of design is a very important and long one.  So you're okay with your data having a strong likelihood for being unusual and perhaps biased in your methods, but you just want to know if there is a significant difference between cases just because maybe there should be a bigger study done, or this is just proof of concept. You cannot make claims about a population from this data unless the population you are making claims about is the 5 patients (in which case this isn't really statistics, this is a census)!  These are the standard warnings of statistics, but if you just want to run a statistical analysis and see what it's like, that can be done!  I think you would be best running two different analyses. One using a one-way ANOVA test with the baseline, warmup, 1 rep, and 10 rep categories with Heart Rate as the data points. And the other using the same test and categories but using systolic blood pressure as the data points. Then, your hypotheses are:  H0: ui=uj for all i=j  H1: ui=/=uj for some i=/=j  And the results of that test will tell you if there is a significant difference between at least one group, ie can you use the alternate hypothesis. Then you can do specific means testing between each category and the baseline."
vegas,3a2twr,Orikons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:15:44 2015 UTC,"Well, so the condition I am studying is all-cause pulmonary hypertension, which people can get from heart failure, COPD, Phen-Fen use for weight loss back in the day, and other genetic causes that can affect the heart and lungs. A lot of people are walking around with pulmonary hypertension. I would not say that my study population is entirely representative, they were picked from a pre-lung transplant group which has baseline activity-exercise requirements.   Maybe given that my population is so small and not representative of that type of patient as a whole, I just need to show trends as the basis for further, broader research? Am I overthinking (which is entirely possible)? In that case, I still need to use Excel to graph my data and maybe find some linear regression trend to start to form the case for correlation between my ordinal ratings of perceived exertion and my measured vital signs? In that case, I just need to learn to use Excel 2013.   I certainly don't want to say there's something significant where there's nothing, and I don't the obverse either. I do want to be thorough though, as I'm going to be presenting this to a lot of people and don't want my methodology or math to be subject to criticism. If anything's going to be criticized, I want it to be my conclusions.   Thank you for your thoughtful and helpful answer! When I was designing this project, I was told I was trying to do too much. Even after simplifying my designs, I gathered way more data points than I needed, and have sifted it down to the heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion as my very important pieces of information to look at.   Would you recommend that I forgo statistical analysis as it's not powered sufficiently and simply graph the results and find a line of best fit?"
vegas,3a2twr,Orikons,2,Wed Jun 17 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"Finding a line of best fit is equivalent to finding a mean value of y at each given x point and then looking for the line that passes through them all. This could be enough for you, but do not extrapolate outside your data set, you can interpolate, however. Be cautious about making claims to the entire population. You may want to find citable documents and other resources that talk about the subject you are interested in and weave them into your research paper. This is preliminary research, so you will want lots of sources that you can use to see how data should look (ie how does systolic blood pressure react to exercise in this group, what do sources say) which will help your case. This will help give you talking points and provide credibility to a small data set by way of having lots of secondary supporting qualitative data. Also you can talk about your data backing up these qualitative sources, instead of making claims about how your data applies to a population which may be met whlith criticism depending on who's listening. Also focus on why you want to research this and how it can help.  I hope this helps!"

However, the grand-standing that it's much worse in DC gets really annoying. Yes, humidity is worse here but that humidity provides a haze in the air protecting you from the full UV of the sun. In LV, there is no such barrier and we are at the mercy of a flesh-searing desert sun. The desert summer, as we know, cooks your flesh right on the bone and sucks the liquid from your body with stunning efficiency.   And on one point, I will agree with DC on why their summers might seem a little worse...air coniditioning is often treated as optional in many buildings. We in LV don't mess around...there will be air conditioning or there will be riots!!!"
vegas,39zp81,everyonelikesnoodles,9,Tue Jun 16 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"I moved to Atlanta from Vegas about 17 years ago and I still can't stand the humidity.  I'd prefer 100 degrees of dry heat than 85 degrees of humid heat.  With dry heat you can find shade, the sweat evaporates cooling you off.  A breeze or a fan works wonders.  In humid heat you're just fucked without air conditioning to remove the humidity that holds the heat in.  Shade doesn't matter.  A fan only blows warm humid air at you.  Plus at least the nights will cool things off in the desert.  In Atlanta it's just as warm, humid, sticky and sweaty at midnight."
vegas,39zp81,Roook36,12,Tue Jun 16 11:01:56 2015 UTC,"Moved to Vegas from Virginia, an hour from DC. I much prefer the climate out here. I can't stand humidity."
vegas,39zp81,golfwithafrisbee,3,Tue Jun 16 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think that's fair. If humidity drives you up the wall, as it does many people, I can see how you would appreciate the change. For me, I no longer get itchy red welts in the summer time as I did in LV. I have super sensitive skin so the UV was really hard for me to take."
vegas,39zp81,everyonelikesnoodles,3,Tue Jun 16 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"From DC and frequent Vegas.  I prefer Vegas summers to DC summers simply because of the humidity.  I'm a sweater and in the humidity, the sweat just sticks to you and it's gross.  In Vegas, I never really need to have change of clothes with me during the day.  Really just depends on what you hate more, heat or humidity."

The high humidity plus 95+ degree weather definitely wins in an awful weather contest. However, it also depends where in the Florida though. I've found summer in Daytona Beach area quite bearable because there's less humidity, but anything central like Orlando? Forget it, that's absolute hell some days."

vegas,39zp81,just_dots,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Even right by the ocean the humility was still unbearable. I was staying at a hotel  blocks from the ocean in South Beach last September when the weather was in the 80s for the most part, yet it felt gross and sticky every time I stepped outside. Vegas was still in the 90s-100s at the time where I felt much more comfortable.  I felt the same way when I was in Austin a few months ago. It was 80 degrees but the humility made it feel much worse, not to mention all the bugs that we don't have to deal with in LV."
vegas,39zp81,spilk,4,Tue Jun 16 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Lived in Florida 6 years and then moved to Vegas 8 years ago. And let me tell you, FUUUUUUCK humidity. During the 6 months of summer in Florida I was either marinating in my own sweat or freezing to death by walking in air conditioned places while soaked in wet. In Vegas it can be 110 but find a shade, get a light breeze and it's not bad at all. Hell, even without shade, last weekend I rode my dirt bike through the desert, covered in plastic and Kevlar gear and helmet from 10 am till 5 pm and while it was hot, it was enjoyable. Tried riding in Florida one summer and almost died of heat stroke. In high humidity our body's evaporative-cooling system just doesn't work."

vegas,39zp81,westtexasforever,2,Tue Jun 16 12:22:56 2015 UTC,"By ""snow"" it's really more like a light dusting that melts as soon as it stops snowing. It usually snows in parts of the valley every year, but the only time I recall having any sort of legit snow was 6-7 years ago when it snowed like 3 inches and they ended up closing the schools and what not because of it. As a Canadian that probably sounds like a joke but a lot of the roads were frozen and we don't have the equipment here to deal with it."
vegas,39zp81,westtexasforever,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:28:44 2015 UTC,It makes perfect sense. 3 inches of snow in a place that never sees that much snow can fuck shit up.

Hakkasan is closed Tuesdays so that's why there wasn't much nightlife at MGM. Drai's is pretty much the only large club open on Tuesdays. MGM really doesn't have too much going on there except during fights or busy weekends so I'd recommend checking out some other casinos if you're looking to just hangout or gamble with other people. Cosmopolitan, Aria, and Planet Hollywood are some of my favorites.  Wednesday has much better options with both Light at Mandalay Bay and Surrender at the Wynn open. I'd recommend Surrender as they have Flosstradamus headlining."

Since you're close to Mandalay Bay, head over there for their free champagne sunset toast at Mix Bar for an awesome view. They also have Light which is a night club but the clubs here really don't get interesting until much, much later, like around 12-1. Also it's early in the week so I'm not even sure they'd be open. Excalibur and NYNY are more ""family friendly"" casinos and the area next to the Monte Carlo is generally a chill area.   I would say spend your days looking into a day/pool club for more of a party vibe. Try checking out Drais, it's a rooftop pool on the corner of LV Blvd and Flamingo which I personally think is walkable from where you're at. Rehab at Hard Rock is usually packed, a little douchey IMO but if you're looking for more people, that's where to look. My friend was literally at Omnia (club at Caesar's Palace) last night and posted a bunch of pictures this morning and from the looks of it, it seemed incredibly fun and lively. Marquee at the Cosmopolitan is another club that is consistently busy. Downtown Vegas/Fremont street would be ideal on a weekday. You won't find any crazy parties going on for the most part, but there's some interesting night life down there."

vegas,39x8jh,undead_carrot,6,Mon Jun 15 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea.  I've become a bit of a spa day pass junkie and plan a half day for this kind of thing each trip... definitely a cost effective way to spend $40-60 considering relative Vegas entertainment costs.  My spa experience is limited, however I can comment on a few.  Qua at Caesars is my favorite.  It has a lot of cool features, including a room where it snows.  The spa at Aria would be my second favorite, however more so because it has nice co-ed pool area that my wife and I could enjoy together.  I believe they also had the experiential rains, which were neat.  Canyon Ranch at Venetian/Palazzo was ok.  It had some nice rooms, and a larger co-ed area.  The drawback is access; it feels really tucked away and took a while to get to it.  I've heard good things about the spas at Cosmo, Wynncore, and Mandarin Oriental, however I've never attended either, so I can't definitively vouch for them."
vegas,39x8jh,MizterD,8,Mon Jun 15 16:11:05 2015 UTC,"Second Canyon Ranch.  Well, at least that's where my kid's mom wife likes to waste spend a day getting away from the kids enjoying some quality time with strangers a good book.  A day pass is priced fairly reasonably."
vegas,39x8jh,SubCircus,4,Mon Jun 15 18:25:52 2015 UTC,The Spa at Mandarin Oriental is by far the most beautiful spa I have ever seen and I have about 200 nightly hotel stays each year. It's also the only Forbes 5 Star rated Spa in the state. It's two floors and has outstanding services and facilities. That would be my vote.
vegas,39x8jh,jetboy787,3,Mon Jun 15 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"Without question, it's the Mandarin Oriental. I would not go on a weekend as it's a small space and the other patrons can be a tad bit disrespectful. It's, by far, the nicest spa in Vegas. It's nearly perfect in every way."
vegas,39x8jh,purplenightsky,2,Mon Jun 15 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"I've never had a ""spa day"" but I got a Groupon for the Hilton spa at Lake Las Vegas - was about $130 after tip and whatnot.   Worth it? Mehhhhh.   The facilities were nice. Steam room, ""healing waters"" cold pool, jacuzzi, and a sauna. The package included a 60 minute massage as well. The massage was pretty nice, but maybe I'm not a spa person, because I just can't see paying as much as I did to do what I did again.   And gauging how there were only maybe four staff on board for a giant facility, other people aren't either?"
vegas,39x8jh,trshtehdsh,2,Mon Jun 15 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"I was mostly thinking paying the admission to use facilities and not paying to get a service, basically because it's less than a show but can kill a lot more time. The admission to most of the places I've seen maxes out at about 60 dollars. Did you tip people while you were in the spa or did you only tip your massage therapist? Should I plan to tip in addition if I don't order drinks do you think?"

It could involve the Buddhist Refuge or Five Precepts ceremony.  In Nevada there is no set requirement on how a ceremony be conducted. Except that the couple a witness and the Officiant all be present in the same place... no skype weddings :)  This means each and every ceremony can be tailored and scripted to the couples unique wishes, for their special day."

vegas,39su9q,tin1bbi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:55:31 2015 UTC,What if your undergrad degree isn't in education? Don't you have to basically pay for that program that runs you through some of the classes at a fast pace on the weekends or something?

vegas,39stj4,fiwer,3,Sun Jun 14 15:03:23 2015 UTC,We get 4 weeks of paid time off in Australia.   I take mine at half pay to take 8 weeks off a year.   I've done Vegas before at 5 nights and have enjoyed it so much that I want to return for 19 :)
vegas,39stj4,karibear909,4,Sun Jun 14 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to get sick of it by the time night 19 rolls around. Unless you have a ton of money, 19 days is a lot to spend in Vegas. If I were you, I would seriously consider going some other places while you're here. It's going to be pretty damn hot though when you've planned your trip, so a lot of the typical things I would suggest, will probably be too hot to do. Red Rock, Valley of Fire, Zion, Hoover dam, Grand Canyon etc. At that point in the summer, I'd be itching to get away from the heat and want to go to Lake Tahoe or San Diego or something lol what kinds of things are you looking to do the time that you're here?"
vegas,39stj4,tin1bbi,2,Sun Jun 14 22:44:32 2015 UTC,LOL. I can't even fathom what someone would do for 19 days in Vegas. I think 5-7 days is more than sufficient.
vegas,39stj4,SurlyQueue,2,Sun Jun 14 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Take at least one trip (maybe two) outside of the Vegas area.  Within four hours (drive): Grand Canyon, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Provo, Phoenix, Zion National Park, Brice Canyon, Tonopah, Death Valley, San Diego (5hr).  You will be very bored of Vegas after 19 days."
vegas,39stj4,karibear909,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:57:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I don't have the energy to venture outside of Vegas especially for a 4-5 hour drive.  I've had a particularly stressful year and want to relax on this vacation ie. relax by the pool with cocktail and ipad.  Driving for 4-5 hours each way with jetlag would be too much unfortunately.
vegas,39stj4,SurlyQueue,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"Also check prices at the MGM Signature, it's right next to the MGM but the rooms are all suites and come with kitchenettes (refrigerator, stove, microwave, sink) something like that would probably be handy to have if you're going to be here that long. Also, I just had some friends in town a couple weeks ago and they had a room at Harrah's, they managed to get an upgrade to a suite, and it was a really nice room. They have also stayed at the Monte Carlo and the room there was not bad and the pool seemed like a decent hang out. As for hooters, it's your basic of the basic hotel, it's not horrible if you're just coming to party for a weekend in Vegas and need a bed to sleep in, but it's absolutely nothing fancy. The pool at Hooters is pretty nice though and free to get in. The rooms at the Flamingo are basic I felt as well. The Luxor has a horrible perfume smell to the casino that gave me a headache, I'd probably never stay there. Also the rooms at the Delano are pretty nice. That's all I can give you personal experience with. Oh and also downtown, the Golden Nugget has a pretty bitchen pool with a water slide that goes through a shark tank and the rooms are pretty good as well (at least in the tower my friend was staying in)."
vegas,39stj4,TwisterII,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"I get that, but I'd think the jetlag would wear off after the first week.  I know most people have different expectations of vacation than Americans, who only take a week at a time, so I'm sure you know how to manage that time best.  For me, I'd get bored after that fourth day and would be looking for something else to do."
vegas,39stj4,Mustard-Tiger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:07:41 2015 UTC,"Look at SLS. The monorail is in the back and you can get a pass to get to center strip really quick. This may be more desirable since you'd be able to get away from ""The Strip"" to relax. Also you'd be much closer to downtown. I love SLS and think they have an amazing room product at a really great price."

vegas,39stj4,westtexasforever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:32:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for your opinion. Luxor has been scratched off the list!
vegas,39stj4,badfishquart,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:14:21 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into Harrah and Flamingo? Pricing wise these tend to be similar to Luxor and less than MGM. They have great locations mid-strip so you are accessible everywhere by foot.  Also they in the immediate vicinity of two of my favorite joints in Vegas, O'Shea and Carnival Court. Flamingo also has bursting pool parties throughout the week for free so that is something cheap to do during the days.  Also don't miss out Downtown. There is a whole new world to discover there especially Fremont East."
vegas,39stj4,badfishquart,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"I've been inside Harrah's and it was a little too dated for me.  This was 2011 though, and they may have remodeled the hotel...  Flamingo pricing for the FAB rooms are a great price but compared to the GO rooms they really suck.    I've honestly have not set foot into Bally's but I do like the location on strip :)"

Like others are saying, why not rent a car for a few days and see the beautiful Southwest? Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Arches National Park, Yosemite, Death Valley.

You've got people that have never been to the states coming and TBH I'm pretty positive you will grow tired of casino after casino. They'll all start blending together.

They do some all the way out to the South rim, but it'll cost at least 4 times as much.  You can do it all in a day.

The rest of the canyon is lovely too, but not walking the Bright Angel Trail is like coming to Vegas but not gambling.  I wouldn't recommend hiking down all the way to the bottom, but in the first half-mile or so you can get a good gist of the experience."

vegas,39sp6k,SurlyQueue,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"That's going to be difficult to do well.  It's a four hour drive each way.  You would head out at 8am, get there by noon, leave by 4, be back by 8.  I don't really recommend this option, as it means twice as much drive time as tour time.  The western rim would be a better use of your time, even though it's a lesser experience.  In my opinion, the Grand Canyon is worth some extra time.  If you really want to do it right, budget in an overnight stay.  Give it the time it deserves."

vegas,39s1to,mdefaz13,2,Sun Jun 14 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"We have three major hospital systems comprising of 11 hospitals, plus four other facilities.   The three St. Rose facilities, (Siena, San Martin, and De Lima,) owned by parent company Dignity Health, are incredible. Almost everyone I know loves working for them. Good pay, good benefits.  HCA owns three hospitals in the valley as well, (Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills,) and they are all fairly well respected. Good pay, decent benefits.  UHS owns five facilities, (Centennial Hills, Summerlin, Spring Valley, Desert Springs, Valley,) and is building a sixth, (Henderson Hospital,) set to open in 2017 I believe. They are decent hospitals I guess, though lower on a lot of lists than the others I have mentioned. Decent pay, good benefits.  There is also a large county hospital which includes our only level-1 trauma center in the region. It's...inner-city. They're respectable as a trauma center, burn care center, and children's ER/Trauma. It's a county facility so the pay is quite low but the long-term government benefits are great.   There's also another small facility in North Las Vegas, called North Vista. I don't know much about it, except that it's apparently in the middle of some rather rough neighborhoods. I know nothing of their pay or benefits.  There's also two VA hospitals.  Las Vegas is not a strong medical community. We have ZERO nationally recognized facilities in U.S. News and World Report. Find me another top-30 city that can say that!  :-/  I hope his helps a little."

The wages for a respiratory therapist here in Vegas are very competitive and I see openings for RT's all the time at my hospital. The St Rose hospitals are probably the best to work for but keep in mind that they have had a history of laying off clinical staff in the past, where as HCA has never really had that problem."

They were given pretty sizeable severance packages and allowed to hold on to their health benefits for a short amount of time there after.

Yes, I would rather pay $5 and wait than miss an hour or more of work to drive downtown: I make more than $5 an hour, so I would be losing money to drop everything to get a coffee and donut. I never want them before 10am (when I'm already working), and they close at 5pm (so I can't exactly go after work). Is $5 a shocking amount to spend on a delivery that would kill an hour of my day or more? Paying 10x more for coffee from a shop rather than making it at home is already frivolous, so clearly I'm not a frugal person; might as well add another $5 to the fire and thank jebus I'm single w/o kids so I can afford sweet, sweet OFace donuts."

In fact, his glazed doughnut is the best I've ever had.  I really, really dislike Mr Glazier for a lot of the ways he runs his business, but I'll never stop eating those doughnuts. I think they are $8 per dozen too. Really great deal and tons of variety."
vegas,39pxiv,JRclarity123,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"They're also half price after, like, 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  So, as a person who's only lived here for a about 2 years, what is it that Mr. Glazier does that's so bad? I know he doesn't use union employees because there are always protestors outside of the one on Warm Springs. Anything else?"
vegas,39pxiv,littlebittykittyone,3,Sat Jun 13 22:29:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't give a shit about unions. My beef with him is how cheap he is and how that affects his products. I wrote about it awhile ago. Give me a couple hours to get back to my laptop and I'll copy and paste my rant.  COPIED COMMENT FROM EARLIER BELOW  As far as selection goes, you won't find anything close to Glaziers. It is as close to a Publix as you can get in Las Vegas, very east coast. I live right around the corner and when I first moved here, I was in love with Glaziers. Now, however, not so much. The food is still reasonably priced and the selection is still top notch, but the policies and cost cutting measures Mr. Glazier has implemented are a huge turn off. First off, Mr. Glazier (you can always see him in the store, older, heavier guy with white hair walking around with a shopping cart and a clip board) is extremely cheap. His employees are all wearing the same size polo shirts, which are XXL. The smaller women look ridiculous in them. Also, food is frequently kept out on the shelves much longer than the expiration date. Many times I have come home only to find that I had purchased expired food. It's not just the made-in-store products. Even boxes of Hamburger Helper can be beyond the expiration date. I set aside 28 varieties of greek yogurt one day because they were all bad. I told a store clerk about it and he took them aside in a box. I made a lap of the store and discovered him putting them back on the shelves. When confronted, he said that his boss told him to put them back front and center. If you don't believe me, go grab some random food from the bakery and look at the expiration dates. Shopping here is like a scavenger hunt and you are constantly pulling things from the back of the shelves. Another thing that really bugs me is that Mr. Glazier is constantly worried about theft. (Even though the store is in a great neighborhood across the street from Rhodes Ranch) It's a huge bummer to be yelled at for eating a donut in the store. If you buy a bottle of water at the lunch counter, they will put a big red sticker on it so that security knows it isn't stolen. Just try and say you don't need the sticker. They'll freak out because Mr. Glazier will fire them for forgetting the sticker. They put stickers on anything not in a grocery bag. They have one or two security guards at the front doors constantly looking in peoples carts for stickers. Newsflash Mr. Glazier, you are spending more money on stickers and security than people are stealing from you and treating everyone like a criminal is a horrible business model. There are other minor issues such as the poor lighting, dust on the shelves and low refrigeration of some products, but all of that is no big deal when you compare it to the cheapness of Mr. Glazier."
vegas,39pxiv,JRclarity123,2,Sun Jun 14 00:47:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I buy produce and cleaning supplies at Glaziers and that's been about it. I kind of felt that Publix-vibe when I first went in there as well but it's definitely not the same as a Publix. I would kill for a Publix out here."
vegas,39pxiv,littlebittykittyone,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:04:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. Glaziers has the best deli I've found in town and their baked goods are solid when you catch them fresh.

vegas,39lizy,imakeyourday,3,Sat Jun 13 08:48:49 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this for a long time, but I've recently lost interest. Sometimes, like you said, they're up by the register and easy to find. In my experience though, ~70% percent of the time they're totally hidden. You can just buy them by themselves though, and owe nothing at the register. Recently though the coupons have been messing up. They will be for a certain flavor that's not clearly stated on the offer and then it ends up not being free, and I paid for something I really had no interest in buying otherwise. Usually I'm very good at checking them to see the fine print, but there's been times when they just would be insanely tricky. Like last time there was an offer for these but I didn't notice it was only valid for ones that said ""lemonade"" in tiny print under where it says ""Mountain Spring Water"" or something similar. So just watch out, if you play this game there will be plenty of times where you can't find it or it you'll end up accidently not paying close enough attention.

You confused a cooperate website, that you voluntarily visit, that provides a free service (in exchange for ad revenue) with a government that forcefully imposes it's will upon you without your consent. If reddit doesn't want to provide a venue for some ideas, that's their freedom. Do you think Walmart should allow pro-marijuana meetings in the garden section? Or Klan meetings by the bedsheets? They (just like reddit) have no responsibility to provide venues for speech that hurt their business. You are free to leave (as you are doing).  That's all good. That is exactly how free speech works. If you think that's fascism, please retake the history class that you keep butchering quotes from.

I felt the exact same way about NYC and SF. DTLV has a real bohemian vibe that is felt less and less in NYC due to relentless gentrification and homogenezation of the Big Apple- how many Starbucks and bank branches does one need in a 5 blocks radius anyway?  In particular, I love exploring all the artist studios on the second floor of The Beat. That building truly is an artist sanctuary, which NYC used to be but sadly not any longer."

vegas,39et5v,kylificent,2,Thu Jun 11 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"As long as you can cover a replacement window for the owner of the vehicle, sure do it.

vegas,39et5v,J-DawgDBZ,2,Thu Jun 11 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"1) Call 911 first. 2) Check to see if car is unlocked. 3) Wait 30 seconds. 4) Smash window.       Depending on the level of distress or consciousness of the victim, the order of these steps can be switched around, and #3 can be ignored entirely.  This is one of those ""I don't care if I'm allowed to do it or not""-type situations."

vegas,39et5v,hardtoremember,2,Thu Jun 11 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"Story: Last year, my SO and I were at Chipotle and were on our way out the door. We noticed a car parked up front that had an infant (3 months) and a toddler (maybe 1-2 years) in the backseat. Windows were down but the sun was blazing, its mid summer, and the baby is in direct sunlight. I look to my SO and say we have to call the police. The mother inside notices us and hops out of line and says ""Its okay, I'll be right out. I'm just ordering."" She goes back inside. I go to the back of her car to get her plate ID, she sticks her ignorant head back out Chipotle's door and claims the kids are fine and itll only be a second. She also said it is such a hassle to take the kids in/out of the car. I yell at her thats its fucking 110 degrees and her baby is in the sun. So she runs inside, I'm assuming to cancel her order, comes back out all smiley and says thanks for your concern and left. Fuck that lady."

vegas,39et5v,pattywayne,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think ordinary citizens are allowed to do this. I suppose the correct course of action is to notify police if you see this happening. As with many things this will come down to a judgement call, if you think a child or animal may die if you don't do something then go ahead and do it. If your just being a prick and looking for a legal loop hole to bash cars this is not it."
vegas,39et5v,BreakAwayGlass2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"Call 311 (non-emergency) and ask, unless you see it happening in which case call 911.

vegas,39et5v,ragefirerage,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:48:34 2015 UTC,I would not ticket you if you were to save the life of an animal or person that is inside a vehicle that couldn't get out themselves.

vegas,39fg36,mist91,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:56:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I believe it is an American Products Quantum Stainless Steel Filter, its egg shaped and has the round pleated filters inside.  I cant take a picture of where the water is leaking from as this is on the underside of the tank where the water exits after being filtered.   Since the filter is made of steel and seems to be in perfect shape and the filter cartridges themselves are easily replaced, I really would rather not spend $1k to replace it since when it is not leaking it does just fine at cleaning the pool.  If you know of a professional pool equipment person that you can recommend as being honest and fairly priced I would appreciate it."

I would apply with Caesar's, MGM(Mirage Resorts Events Productions for scenery), and Boyd properties, though the process can take months. Desert Labor, 3G, Stage Crew, and Rhino Staging are good to fill in the gaps from 720 when you're just getting to the city. For scenery, there is Dynamic Scenery."

Gun ranges, although you might need to be 18 or 21 and that probably isn't that interesting to you if you are in America already. Maybe go and jump off the stratosphere (or one of the other 'rides) or there is a rope line thing at the Rio I think. There are arcades everywhere. You could probably go have a look at the pawn stars place or one of the other discovery show locations. Maybe go to a buffet and eat all day. Pool somewhere. Pin ball museum, neon museum but that's probably a bit slow for a 16 year old guy. That's what I can remember right now. There is a guide book thing I got before that had pretty much everything in it. I was going to give it a skim and see what it had but I cant find it. It was purplish pink, helped me out a good bit. Edit - check out the various tours, I went on a gangster one which was pretty good. The Mafia/Gangster museum was pretty good too."

The Silverbowl, which is behind the UNLV football stadium is a free outdoor range (no staff, no equipment). There is also Clark County Shooting Complex which is at the northern limit of the city, but I haven't been there so I can't tell you much about it. I don't know which places let you rent compound bows, as I shoot traditional (honestly, I thought Pacific did let you rent them)."
vegas,3942mq,changtronic,2,Tue Jun 9 04:55:07 2015 UTC,I will second impact archery. The staff there is really good at getting you comfortable shooting.
vegas,3942mq,holder_account,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"The Clark County Shooting Complex does most of the shooting sports.  I know that they do have stationary archery ranges and I am pretty sure they have what I'll call skeet archery, where they throw targets and you shoot them out of the air.  It is all the way north on Decatur.  I know that they rent equipment but I am unsure what type of bows they have.  It's a really great place with great people (at least it was a year ago, haven't been back since I moved)"

vegas,396xoa,VegasGeoff,12,Tue Jun 9 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yup - I don't even think it's very hard anymore to find an apartment that's willing to accept a small animal.   It blows my mind and makes me really sad that this is even the thought process for some people. Oh, I'm moving and I have this dog I ""love"" but this apartment is a little cheaper/nicer/the first one I found and no pets allowed so BAI DOG. Ugh. If you love your pet, you will find a way to make it work. And if you don't love your pet, you should really question whether or not to ever adopt again."

vegas,393ll7,iamateenagehandmodel,6,Tue Jun 9 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"My last trip to Vegas was solo and I loved every second of it. I had been before with others and found that I gave in a lot on doing things others wanted to do rather than do what I wanted, and this disappeared on a solo trip.    You're right, people are there to have a good time, but I never ran across anyone anywhere that didn't want to talk.  You'll meet people if that's what you want to do, and if you don't it's no big deal.  It's a highly trafficked tourist area.  Safety was never a concern for me. But do your research and know the places that are safer than others. The strip and downtown aren't anything to worry about.  There's plenty of things to do all over the place, from nature at Red Rock and Valley of Fire, to shows, to gaming (which i see isn't your thing but it's a great way to kill some time and have some fun, craps is a great game to learn and people tend to have fun and are friendly. I suggest learning it.)  In short... totally go solo, but be careful, you may never want to do Vegas with friends again."

vegas,393ll7,DeadlySight,3,Tue Jun 9 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"I've been to Las Vegas a number of times all by myself.  For the most part that's due to business or conventions that my employer only allowed one person to go.  But I've also been there solo just for vacation time a few times.  And as many times as I've been there there's still things I haven't been able to do and places I haven't been to.  As others have mentioned YMMV, but since Vegas is a convention city people visiting solo is nothing new.  Don't worry:  enjoy and have fun!"
vegas,393ll7,Bulletproof_Tiger55,2,Tue Jun 9 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"Vegas is a place to party, but it doesn't have to be with your friends. At 23 if you have cash the pools will fill your days and the clubs at night."
vegas,393ll7,DeadlySight,2,Tue Jun 9 03:02:55 2015 UTC,How much cash are we talking?
vegas,393ll7,mohavewolfpup,2,Tue Jun 9 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"You can have a great time here for really cheap. A lot of people just choose not to do it that way. For hotel look somewhere like Flamingo, or better yet Tuscany Suites. If clubs are your thing then yeah, you'll spend some cash $40+ cover, $12 beers). But if you're more into the off the beaten path stuff, there's plenty to do. Goldspike downtown is a blast and there's no cover and drinks are affordable. Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire are amazing and both are a short drive away. Simply put, Vegas is what you want it to be. It can be relaxing, exciting, cheap, or expensive. A buddy of mine who has visited 3 times prior and always talked me into going to clubs and stuff finally said he wanted to do a ""locals"" trip. After the weekend he said it was his best Vegas trip to date, and we spent next to nothing."

Old ones like Frank and Barbara could be good, Divas, etc etc. Or go See Cirque shows for newer.  Museums? Lots around.  Like nature?

vegas,393ll7,tin1bbi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:46:44 2015 UTC,"Rent a car and do a day trip out to the Grand Canyon, totally worth it, if you get up early enough I have done it in one day and came back and still hit up the clubs for 10pm. Also checkout Red Rock and Valley of Fire. Hang out by some pools and just have some drinks and food and mingle. I have been to Vegas many many times, and what I always tell people that have never been is simply this, people don't go to Vegas to stay in their hotel rooms and be anti-social. People go to gamble, party and hookup. I am also in my 20's and when I was single hooking up with 5 girls on a 4 day Vegas trip was very easy to do. Have a blast!"

""So your gigabyte fiber product is slower than my current mid tier service from Cox?""  ""I guess so"".  Then I hung up.

That being said, July 1st Uber is coming back to town. Cabbies will either have to learn to adapt or go out of business, my preference being the latter."

Ontop of that the gas money comes out of pocket.   Now if you ever seen cabs in lines infront of hotels/casinos, they are still on the clock(most have engine running ) and have been waiting about 20mins-1 hours for next guest/client .....Lets say you way 30 mins and the person you pick up only wants to go one block over, i would imagine that would piss anyone off(wait time:distance)... but if the tip is good it makes up for it....  1 or 2 dollar tip seems kinda low. even on a 10 dollar fair. its not always the % that counts... granted if they are assholes from the start it will drop the tip."

They treated me like an idiot that didn't know what a flea was and it was infuriating.   Then they kept my dog for a few hours to give him a flea bath, and when I I got him back, he STILL had fleas.

I do it all the time, no one cares if you're the random dude.  http://goldspike.com/downtown-dodgeball/downtown-dodgeball/  Also, if you don't mind working in a lounge area (with some music playing in the background), you can always sit in Goldspike and do some work. I do it all the time. It's a relaxing area to get stuff done, until about 5 pm. Also, if you have to take phone calls, the music can be a bit distracting."

It's a melting pot though, everyone is from everywhere. You rarely find people who's grandparents, parents, and then have all lived in the same neighborhood their whole lives."
vegas,38zhhv,FinnTheDogg,3,Mon Jun 8 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Hey! I moved here from NC. There has been pretty much no culture shock... a slightly different mix to the pot, like more of an Asian community here, a little more international influence than in the South. More transplants and tourists. Less churchy, more libertarian as you said. Las Vegas and the South are both very stereotypically ""American"" and so far have a lot of similarities. The suburbs are identical, except there are palm trees here and grass over there."

vegas,38zhhv,frowny_ponts,0,Mon Jun 8 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Charlotte (spent most of my life there until recently) and I also lived in Wilmington for a while. By stereotypical American I do mean all the chains are here, and you drive to them and park in a huge parking lot, and you see the 500 lb man shopping on his scooter, and there is a shitty bus system that only desperate people use, and there are your ritzy residential areas, your working class family areas and your seedy areas. I spent some time in NYC and THAT was a culture shock. This is just more America, but in the desert. Oh and there are giant signs that say PENIS and billboards for strippers etc that you would expect to see here, and never in a million years see in the South. More 24 hour stuff and no last call! But such differences are slight, ESPECIALLY if you are not a clubber/gambler, partier or a worker in the service/entertainment industry (I am none of these things).   Oh and I have found the cost of living to be pretty much exactly the same as Wilmington, where I came from. Plus I got an extra $100 a paycheck from not having to pay income tax.

There's no culture shock moving here, particularly living in Summerlin. It's just like living in any other suburb in the US.  But once you live here, there is MAJOR culture shock going back, or even just visiting. When I go visit friends in California, it drives me crazy that we have to time our nights out to avoid hitting last call. When I go back to Pennsylvania, buying a 6-pack is like pulling teeth.  Don't buy into the Vegas hype; it's just another community.  (But yeah, if you have no skills you might have trouble finding work. You can always temp if necessary tho, if you don't mind living on minimum wage for awhile.)"

Summerlin is one of the more expensive and homogenous areas. Want to drive a mile and a half to get to a anyplace useful? Great. If you like neighborhoods with ""character"", you'll be disappointed. I like Spring Valley: 5 minutes to Chinatown (yeah, we have one), 10 minutes to the Strip, 15 minutes to McCarran, 20 minutes to Henderson.

If you've sold used Yugos, you can do pretty well; the solar industry has some major churn, but if you stick, you can reputedly make bank.  Cost of living is overall not bad, but there's sort of a cutoff where everything gets shitty - spending less than ~$600 for a 1br is not advised, and finding roomates is a bit tricky. Depending on where you're from, everything is either very close or very frustratingly far away; I'm from the Midwest, so it's category #2 for me.  Summerlin is absolute yuppieville, though I can see the appeal. I live downtown, which is the only place in the city where one could reasonably hope to walk to things (there's still no !@#$! groceries, though.)

I was at a First Friday about that time, and some local glass blowers had a booth, but they weren't offering classes, just selling merchandise. But, they might still be around, and might be able to offer a class or something.  On a slightly related subject, there is now a community woodshop, called the Community Tool Chest, in Las Vegas (warning, some self promotion coming). I know it's not the same, but it is a cool makerspace/community shop. And, we're working on expanding into other trades, such as metal working, glass blowing, concrete countertops, etc. Honestly though I think it will be a little while before we can afford to start hot-works, as it's a fire therefore permitting headache. I know I'm self promoting, but for those of you interested in the 'maker movement', we're trying to get some more stuff going in Vegas."

Just a big chop saw is anywhere from 8 months to 10 months worth of $80 payments, without a stand, stop system, or dust collection. But, it all depends what you are into - there are folks creating some absolutely incredbile stuff in their garages. Some woodworking doesn't require all the big tools, some does.

Depending on what you are moving, this will be your best option.   My wife and I lived in a ~600 sqft apartment (one bedroom) and we decided to use their ""pod."" It's an 8 x 8 x 8 container that worked well for us. You can also rent out space on a trailer, but since we didn't have enough stuff, this was the cheaper option.   The total cost was about $1200. However, which the pod, you are charged a total of about $1500. You are basically renting the pod, and then charged for delivery service. Once the pod makes it to the destination with no damage, you get the $300 back.   The pod is delivered to your location, and it can't be placed on a street. So check with your HOA or apartment to see where the pod can be placed for loading/unloading. The worker I was with had same day turn around, so he showed up with the pod at 10am, and had it back on the same truck at 4pm after we packed everything.   Hope this helps."

If you are into any of the following, I can introduce you to the group(s): Hard Rock/Metal, Renaissance Faire, Goth/Industrial, Cosplay, Karaoke, The LGBT Community, Post-Apocalyptic Stuff, or (totally not creepy, but it will sound like it is) the Fetish Community.

vegas,38r254,CuriousAboutCondos,3,Sat Jun 6 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of really nice high rises in the valley. Like the rest of the valley, they gained a ton of appreciation if you bought them during the recession. There is still a deal or two to out there if you really look. They don't tend to appreciate at the same rate as regular houses, because the ""neighborhood"" is already established. However, you'll definitely still get the traditional 2-4% that everyone gets.  Hoa dues are outrageous, and some are worse then others... Green Valley Ranch, great view, $600 a month in hoa dues. Also, just be aware that when you are doing your taxes, the money you send in hoa dues are NOT tax deductible. Also, you have to elect to put your unit into the rental pool.  The only other advice I would give you would be to make sure you have solid advice in the financing department. A bunch of condo communities aren't FHA approved. Meaning if you are trying to get a government backed loan, they won't lend to condo developments. You will likely need to go traditional.   Hope this help.  Source : realtor"

Long term (thinking retirement), you are better off not getting a high rise condo because of the high purchase costs, high HOA, and low appreciation.  If I sit on my roof, I have a great view, and my mortgage is less than a lot of the high rise HOA monthly fees."
vegas,38r254,kornkid42,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:28:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with condos is that they don't appreciate over the rate of inflation - essentially, your condo will be worth in twenty years roughly the number of cheeseburgers that it's worth today.  I just moved into a really nice (for me) apartment for $700 a month. The ~$300 a month over HOA dues (I'm guessing based on Flys007s data below) isn't going towards equity, but for any period of less than ten years, finance charges will likely be greater than any equity you've built.  Houses are quite cheap around here, though they have upkeep costs of their own. If you want a small luxury property and intend to live there for 10+ years, condos can make sense, but for most folks, renting an apartment or buying a house looks a lot better.

vegas,38r254,jrshaul,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to live in a high rise, you must be okay with being treated like a school child and going all the way down the the lobby floor to get any guests. It's a pain in the ass. At least, this was my experience at Allure.   The HOA was just terrible. New rules and regulations were put into place each week. They changed so frequently, the staff couldn't even keep up with it - so the staff was confused the entire time. The HOA was like you living in your parents house.  Allure is also across the street from the MGM Resorts Festival Grounds, so you'd have to be okay with watching music festival all day a few weekends a month. And when Lucky Dragon Casino starts being built next to it (if they get funding) that will add some headache too."

vegas,38l5mt,fiwer,2,Thu Jun 4 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"I was in Vegas for about a week. I got bored after 2 days, so we went to the Grand Canyon, Valley of Fire, Red Rock Canyon, and the Hoover Dam. All of them were worth it, but the Grand Canyon was breathtaking. If you can, try to get a cabin out there. It is fairly reasonable, and really nice not to have to expedite your experience. The food, gifts shop items, and pretty much everything else is far more reasonable in the National Park, than it is in Vegas. Try El Tovar for breakfast.  Edit: Vegas was neat, but the canyon was the pinnacle of the trip for me."
vegas,38l5mt,mandlebar,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"If you're not already aware: there are three tourist areas of the Grand Canyon: North Rim, South Rim, and West Rim.  North Rim is very far away and not usually considered reasonable from Vegas.  South Rim is a full 4 hours by car.  It's the best view and has the museums, resorts, and tours.  It's the best way to do the Grand Canyon.  The West Rim is pretty close to Vegas, but is least impressive.  There are helicopter tours to the West Rim or you can drive to the Skywalk and hit the Hoover Dam on the way.  In my opinion: the Grand Canyon is definitely worth it.  However, you can't really do it in one day.  Unless you are willing to split your trip in half (50% in Vegas, 50% in GC), you probably wont be able to do both.  Consider doing Red Rock Canyon, Valley of Fire, Hoover Dam, or maybe Zion National Park.  The Grand Canyon is worth it's own trip.  If you skip it, I hope you'll make a trip back later to see it."

Tours from Vegas to Grand Canyon South Rim is approx. 4 1/2 hours driving time. The west rim charges $50.00 per person to get in. If you do a tour, then there is a bunch of 1 day trips to Grand Canyon, Bryce/Zion, Red Rock and so forth. Most of the bus tours on the web that are discounted are with GrayLine Tours, There is Sweetours ( The Best) and Grand Canyon Express. Viator.com uses Gray LIne and they don't allow as much time at the canyon as Sweetours. Sweetours can be had for half price at www.vegastours.com ( $79.00 ). The South Rim is the deepest and most dramatic part of the canyon. Twice as deep and wide as the west rim. The only way to take a tour from Vegas to the South Rim is by Bus or airplane. Otherwise you would drive yourself."

That uncontrollable rush of emotions that make your skin tingle and your stomach get butterflies ans the silly grin you just cant wipe off your face? As silly as that sounds this is how I feel about Disney. I grew up in a not-so-safe household, my mom was disabled, abusive, and my dad just worked too hard for never enough money. Any time the neighbors heard my mom start up they would take my younger sister and I and start up a Disney movie and we would feel safe in our ""happy place"".  Once I turned 16 I started working and saved up to take my sister to Disneyland since we had ALWAYS wanted to go, I soon found out that we could not go because I had to be 18 to rent a room to stay in. A few months before I turned 18 I found out that Disneyland was free on your birthday (2009)! Awesome! Then the fire happened. We lost everything. We had to continue to go to school in smoke-filled clothes until we could buy more. All my savings went to food, clothing  and to try to repair the house since my dad couldn't afford home insurance. Couldn't go for Grad Night because of money.  So here I am 24 years old with a Disney-obsessed nearly-3-year-old (he gets it from his mama) asking to go to Disneyland on a daily basis. My husband makes JUST enough to put the bread on the table and a roof over our heads, thankfully which is all we need. He is in dire need of a vacation and this would be just amazing!

vegas,38e1kb,LVOgre,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"It's more difficult to track a stolen firearm without knowing the serial number.  Unfortunately, there are lots of people that don't document that serial number if they don't have to register the firearm.  So if you call the police and say your Glock is stolen, without a serial number to tell them, it's damn near impossible to find that firearm, and subsequently charge someone with its possession later on."
vegas,38e1kb,candmlaw,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:48:36 2015 UTC,"The serial number is recorded at every step from the manufacturer through the gun dealer, and then recorded at purchase.  It's not that hard to track down a serial number."

vegas,38e1kb,LVOgre,-3,Wed Jun 3 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"The gun lobby has changed the argument away from gun owner accountability and over to the irrational threat of big government taking them when they decide to size power.  I'd prefer that we knew who was allowed to have a gun through the registry to be able to identify those that shouldn't and also to be able to take weapons away from those who have them, commit a crime or go crazy, and would no longer qualify for owning a hand gun.  It seems like the whole argument against a registry is based on issues that aren't happening now, most likely won't happen (and even if they did owning a gun wouldn't help), and the argument ignores the data around gun deaths in america relative to other countries with more gun ownership regulations."
vegas,38e1kb,fiwer,3,Wed Jun 3 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to actually see some numbers on this. How many crimes were stopped? How many legal owners committed a crime and had them confiscated? My experience was that I had to take a day off of work (Metro has cut hours due to budget constraints) and go register the weapon that I planned to carry on me. It makes the cops job easier, I guess I'll find out the next time I get pulled over."
vegas,38e1kb,LVOgre,4,Wed Jun 3 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer that we knew who was allowed to have a gun...    I'll help you out here. Anyone who isn't a convicted criminal of certain types can have a gun.   ...through the registry to be able to identify those that shouldn't, commit a crime or go crazy, and would no longer qualify for owning a hand gun.   That's not what the registry does. By the time the registration would occur, background checks were already completed.   The background check is what (presumably) prevents those who shouldn't be allowed to have guns from purchasing guns, not the registration.   All the registration does is attach a name to a serial number, nothing more. Even removing the serial number would throw a wrench in that, and it's not particularly useful information.    It seems like the whole argument against a registry is based on issues that aren't happening now, most likely won't happen (and even if they did owning a gun wouldn't help), and the argument ignores the data around gun deaths in america relative to other countries with more gun ownership regulations.   I don't buy the ""they're coming for our guns"" argument, the NRA is too strong of a lobby for that to ever come close to happening. It doesn't keep me up at night, and it seems like more of a marketing message for gun and ammunition sellers than anything else.  What the registration does is to create a burden only for law abiding gun owners. Criminals don't register guns. It creates a lot of bureaucracy and cost with very little benefit.  It seems to me that the time and effort would be better spent on better background checks."

Accountability is a good thing, as much as gun-loving nutjobs hate it.

Metro didn't have the resources to be open on a Saturday which meant I'd have to take a day off work to register a firearm that no one even knew I had bought.

vegas,38gzr4,imnotabus,3,Thu Jun 4 03:40:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not a bus either.  You might want to think about renting a car considering all of the things you're talking about.  Being on your own you can take advantage of sudden urges to get up and move, explore, etc. Uber–yes cheaper than taxis, but Uber has just been cleared in NV and we don't yet know all their limits in Vegas (likely no airport or LV strip pickups). SIM–I don't know.  In&Out – Not comfortable walking distance, and even less so in late July when hot as hell.  When you're in an air conditioned rental car you'll see dumb asses walking across freeway overpasses and wonder what they're thinking. Scouting – ""a bunch of them"" no, but if you're going M-W you have a better chance of getting there and in cheaper or free. Great advice from bugsandblood on the metal.  I'm running out of answers on the other stuff, but if you do take my advice on the rental car, don't be afraid to leave it at any casino parking lot overnight once you get your drink on."
vegas,38gzr4,EliminatorSr,3,Thu Jun 4 04:55:38 2015 UTC,If you want to go to In n Out straight from the airport the one at UNLV is gonna be cheaper to taxi to then the one on the other side of the freeway on Trop.  Rent a car if you plan on doing all of that. Club cover will be unavoidable but try going earlier in the day as it should be reduced cover.

Staying at the Aria, but have a vehicle and willing to drive a bit.  On my list so far:  Hash House Makino Mr. Mamas Egg and I Bacchanal Ellis Island Cheesecake Factory  Cheers all."
vegas,38d53l,pcversusmac,3,Wed Jun 3 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"Make sure you read the fine print on those. Sometimes there are restrictions on locations or dates/times. For example, I bought a Groupon for the Paris lunch buffet a couple years ago but it was only valid Monday through Thursday. It's also helpful to read the Q&A section as well.  :)"
vegas,38d53l,tin1bbi,3,Wed Jun 3 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"I was supppppper disappointed by hash house. Sure you get a shitton of food but I thought the taste was very, very meh. Everyone had hyped it up and I walked away saying ""never again."" Still haven't been back. There's a chance I ordered the wrong thing, but my husband also wasn't impressed...  Cheesecake factory is okay but it's just a chain that I don't think is worth going to if you're visiting and trying to go to ""authentic"" Vegas places."
vegas,38d53l,Battletooth,2,Wed Jun 3 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you as well.   I mean, it's a novelty to get massive plates that weigh more than a new born elephant (exaggeration, of course) but it's not flavorful. I had the eggs Benedict and waffles&chicken and a general platter (eggs, hash brown and bacon or something like that.)  Each time I went, I thought what you did. Maybe I got the wrong thing. So I keep trying new stuff and it's always meh.   And I agree with the cheesecake factory, but if there aren't any around OP's location, I wouldn't dissuade him or her. My family from Colorado has to go to In-N-Out whenever they visit, even though it's a chain as well."
vegas,38d53l,Battletooth,2,Wed Jun 3 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm Canadian - so I've not tried places like In-n-Out and Fatburger and 5 guys (although I do drive by a five guys once in a while). I make it a point to try chains that aren't available in Canada when I go to the US, because I want to see what all the fuss is about.  White Castle is not what I was expecting. Taco Bell is just as  shitty here as it is there LOL.  I do try and get to the local mom-and-pop places as well, which is about half my list :)"
vegas,38d53l,drunksage,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"In-N-Out is, in my opinion of course, the best deal.  It's not a gourmet burger from the tastiest cows loaded with only the best toppings. But it's fairly cheap. I can't get a better burger at that price. I'm now cutting bread out from my diet and In-N-Out is the only burger place that I can enjoy eating a ""protein style"" burger without the bun.  Fatburger and 5 guys are also great burgers if you still haven't been to those places.   But if you want ""authentic Vegas food"" I think of the buffets. If your budget allows, go to some nice ones in the hotels, they're pretty good. I know different countries and cities have their own things they're known for, and buffets seem to be the Vegas ""Specialty"". So in case you weren't thinking of those, that may be a few more ideas of things to try out."
vegas,38d53l,stevestloo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"If you go to In-N-Out in Vegas, I'd recommend the location on Maryland instead of the one with the flashy Vegas-style sign on Dean Martin. Crowds get pretty insane for the latter.  You also might look into Shake Shack outside the New York New York casino. I don't think it's better than In-N-Out, but some people do.  For a really good burger that's less widely available, I recommend Bachi Burger. My favorite is the Ronin, cooked medium-rare."
vegas,38d53l,jeepdays,2,Wed Jun 3 19:29:32 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for Hash House, Cheesecake factory, and Ellis Island. All excellent food choices.  Ellis Island is fairly cheap to begin with, and it shows in the quality of the food (not saying it's bad at all)  but I'm a sucker for fresh beer and food. One block off of the strip near Flamingo.   Hash House if you get a skillet for a late breakfast,  you won't be hungry until dinner. There's one right on the strip at The Quad(?)  so driving isn't necessary.   Cheesecake Factory has a ton of choices. Pasta,  burgers, seafood,  etc etc.  Everything I've had was great, but I should note that this was in CT,  but seeing as its a chain you should get the same results. No idea where one is in LV.

The only one I would ever consider going to is the Cheesecake Factory, and only if I were drunk and craving Cheesecake.  Makino in particular is just unbelievably bad.  As far as the rest of the groupons go there are only a couple of standouts.  That Nobu tasting for 2 is a pretty killer deal.  The Golden Steer is a great old Vegas steakhouse, out of all those groupons that's the one I would jump on if I were you."

It's a surprise trip, so I am trying not to ask her too much about it lol."
vegas,38d53l,spilk,3,Wed Jun 3 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, well here are a few options after you get here and ask her about her preference.  There are dozens of others but most of them aren't worth mentioning.  Soho Japanese -  Has a lot of cool fusion dishes and supposedly really good rolls if she likes that kind of stuff.  It's not particularly expensive but it's also not AYCE.  Tokyo Boys - My personal choice for sushi 9 times out of 10.  Might also be a good choice for you because they have a lot of cooked dishes and unlike most sushi joints, their cooked dishes are legitimately great as well.  Not AYCE, but very fairly priced for the quality.  Rolls are fine I guess but that's not really their focus.  Sushi Mon or Goyemon - AYCE.  If she isn't particularly picky about sushi these are probably a good choice.  Not great if you're a snob like me but perfectly fine if you want cheap sushi or like sauce covered rolls.  Kabuto - World-class sushi, ranks amongst the best authentic sushi restaurants in the USA.  Fish is flown in fresh from Japan daily.  Expensive by normal human standards, but a pretty good value if you're crazy about sushi like I am.  I Love Sushi - Only been once, I wasn't particularly impressed but my understanding is that if you love American rolls covered in sauces, this is the place to go.  AYCE.  All of these places are off-strip.  A place with the same fish quality as Tokyo Boys or SOHO would cost probably twice as much on the strip, so I don't really eat sushi on the strip much."
vegas,38d53l,devon223,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with Sushi House Goyemon for all you can eat dinner (not lunch) hours. Can't handle the raw stuff? Grilled fish, baked rolls, and deep fried rolls are plentiful. Seafood doesn't work for you at all? At least there's grilled pork belly and some teriyaki appetizers. And it's more affordable ($27 per person) than the best buffets on the Strip."

No. What you’ll find on the title of a home with a SolarCity power system is a UCC-1 fixture filing. A UCC-1 fixture filing is not a lien against the home. SolarCity files a Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement, or UCC-1, on all of our solar energy systems in the real property records where each system is located prior to or when the system is installed. We file the UCC-1 to notify anyone who might perform a title search on the address where the system is located that our property, the solar energy system, is installed on the home. This filing protects our rights as the system’s owner against any mortgage on the real property. If the lender that holds the mortgage on the real property forecloses on our customer’s home, the UCC-1 filing protects our interest in the solar energy system and prohibits the lender from taking ownership of it.  If a UCC-1 is not a lien, can it be removed?  Yes. We are aware that lenders prefer not to see anything on the title so it’s common practice for us to release the UCC-1 fixture filing for financing purposes and re-file later. In fact, we have a dedicated team for this purpose to ensure that there is no disruption to the sale, purchase or refinancing of your home.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCC-1_financing_statement  Basically a UCC-1 is as SolarCity states, it is a public notice that they own the panels, we own the house, thus if we default on the house the bank cannot take possession of the panels as we don't own them.  Which is true since we don't own them until the contract is up and we opt to purchase them at market value at that time.  ----EDIT----  And since you made me curious, here's the filing from the Clark County web site (sans my name and parcel number for obvious reasons):  SOLARCITY CORPORATION 201501290002621 UCC FINANCE STATEMENT       1/29/2015 2:35:51 PM            $0.00  The $0.00 is the value of that line.

This form is filed in order to ""perfect"" a creditor's security interest by giving public notice that there is a right to take possession of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority. Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers. Once the form has been filed, the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor.  This process is also called ""perfecting the security interest"" in the property, and this type of loan is a secured loan.  A financing statement may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property. The creditor's rights against the debtor and the lessor's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease, respectively, and not the financing statement.

vegas,388kwe,IrishDemon,2,Tue Jun 2 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we've all heard that it takes less energy to run your ac continuously than it does to turn it off while you are gone. It works harder they say, its less efficient. It is a MYTH. By keeping your house colder while you are gone you are making it a heat magnet, see also: the laws of thermodynamics. Plus it just simply isn't true that it takes more energy on startup than it does running continuously   I'm going to disagree, here's why. If you completely turn your AC off during the day, the inside ambient temperature will rise steadily until you turn it back on or the inside and outside temps are the same. It will take longer to bring the temperature back down to a tolerable level and be more expensive (because you're doing this during peak usage rates for NV Energy) than it would have been if you had left your AC on while away. As the ambient temp rises in the house, so does the actual temperature of the objects in your home. Even in a well insulated building, the temperature indoors can reach 95 degrees in a matter of hours. It takes a lot more time and energy to bring the ceramic tile and drywall and other large surfaces of your interior back down compared to the ambient air temp than if you had just set the thermostat at a reasonable away temp. It's also not good for your cabinets and other wood work to get that hot, as the laminates can start to peel. As for making it a heat magnet... the exterior temp (aside from the windows) of the house isn't going to change regardless of the AC running or not. A dark roof, dark paint, exposed south and west facing windows - these are things that add to the heat inside the home. And the fact that we live in the middle of the desert with almost 300 days of sun - the house is already a heat magnet. Finally, the inrush current for a compressor or motor that is at 100% stop absolutely takes more energy to get moving than a motor that is already spinning.   the windows open those nights when it does cool down.   By the end of June, this won't be an option until October with nighttime temps over 90. Once you become acclimated to the Las Vegas temps, you should be hit with the second part of the problem, and that's allergies, and that makes leaving the windows open even more difficult."

But its pretty profound on my usage tracking. Weekends when I'm home and have the A/C on all day= a huge usage.... weekdays when I'm at work most of the day, come home and turn on the A/C much, much less overall usage.  A person here did make a good point that peak hours for NV energy are 1-7 and I usally get home later... so it really does depend on your situation, but from what I've seen 1 degree on the thermostat is 3-4% increase in energy usage from the unit, and there are lots of sources for that. The increased power to bring it back down should not override the savings from leaving it turned up all day, at least in most cases."

Fans do nothing to cool the air. They only circulate air at the ambient temperature of the room. They pull water (sweat) away from your body faster which might make you feel cool, but having them on while you're no in the house?   Absolute waste of energy. Just take $10 out of your pocket and set it on fire every month.  Turn your air conditioners off during the day. I don't know what idiot started this rumor that it uses more energy to cycle them on. Your refrigerator and air conditioning systems cycle on and off all day anyways.  All turning the system off will do is stop this cycling process and save you money.

Yeah apparently the AC thing is something that people cling hard to. Was just hoping to be helpful and point out something that many sources say is a myth, and got two people here really enraged. Its pretty obvious that keeping your ac running all day is going to use more energy than turning it on when you get home.  In the same way that it takes more energy for you to move 1 mile in 5 hours than it does for you to move 1 mile in 5 minutes even though your instantaneous energy expenditure is higher when you are running. Its the time that your unit is running that is important. Same rumor has been started about other things too... ""It takes more energy to start your car than to just keep it running"", ""Don't turn off your computers, because it takes more energy to start them up then keep them running"", etc.  Obviously it depends alot on your personal situation and house, unit ,etc. Which is pretty obvious.

vegas,388kwe,IrishDemon,-9,Wed Jun 3 10:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we've all heard that it takes less energy to run your ac continuously than it does to turn it off while you are gone. It works harder they say, its less efficient. It is a MYTH.   Because you say so? No doubt you will be nominating yourself for a Nobel prize for this discovery and every engineer in the world will have to admit that they are wrong.  Edit: OK. Responding to thodas90's suggestion that I contribute. An air conditioner works by the evaporation and condensation of freon. When liquid freon is released from the compressor it turns in to gaseous freon. The expansion is endothermic. It absorbs heat. The blower pushes air past the copper coils holding the cold freon creating cold airflow. The freon then needs to be recompressed to repeat the process. There are two ways your air conditioner does this. Passively and actively. Passively, the ac circulates the freon through the fins and blows air across them with a fan. This works just like your cars radiator. This is very efficient because it uses the heat absorbing capacity of the atmosphere. Actively, the ac uses the compressor which does just as its name implies. It compresses the freon back into a liquid state using an electric pump. The compressor uses most of the electricity consumed by the ac. It also releases more heat from the electric motor. This is very inefficient.  When an ac is operating at low load, turning on a couple times an hour for a few minutes, it gets maximum use of efficient passive cooling. When the ac is under heavy load, like when you turn it on after letting your home raise to 100 degrees during the day, it gets no benefit from passive cooling and does all the work with the compressor. Not only is it running at its worst efficiency and pushing heat back into the system which just makes it work harder, it also adds substantial wear and tear that will eventually cause your air conditioner to break and need replacement. In extreme cases, where the unit is too small for the space it is cooling the heat generated by the compressor exceeds its cooling ability and the compressor freezes up. Resulting in a very expensive emergency call to the 24hr ac repair guys.  My source, a couple years with my Dad's HVAC business.  Anyone following OP's very bad and ill-informed advice will wind up adding as much as $1,000 to their electricity bill over the summer. Not only that they will put extreme wear on the unit eventually resulting in a whopping replacement bill. Most people just can't afford that. OP's advice is not only dead wrong its irresponsible. Especially since OP acknowledges that ""we've all heard that it takes less energy to run your ac continuously than it does to turn it off while you are gone"". Yes we have all heard that. We have heard it from AC repairmen, salespeople, the instructions that come with our air conditioners, and responsible and knowledgeable people the world over.  If I sound testy it's because I dislike the fact that people will believe anything they read on the internet even if it comes from the Reddit comment section then become irate when anyone has the temerity to insist that the emperor's new clothes aren't there. I am equally disatisfied with the new version wisdom adopted by America where facts are put up to a popular vote and whichever version is believed in most fervently is accepted as truth."

Been at a bachelors party that brought in 2 girls that were nothing like the pics that they posted and they tried jacking the price up immediately and their protector/ guard guy tried playing the intimidation game.  Luckily we had more than a few big guys of our own and sent them all on their way.  Another time the girls were crazy hot and were down for just about anything assuming the money was right.

You don't get to bachelor party often and shelling out the extra money for a club makes sense because it is reliable.  AKA: You go to the club, you flash around some money and the hot girls will come to you.  There is almost no way for it to fail and you're guaranteed to have a minimum level of fun.  If you have girls come to your room the experience will likely just be awful a lot of the time.  AKA Some super ugly fat girls come and start making money demands.

Scenario B:  Two young hot professionals show up and they know how to show a group of gentlemen a good time.  And everybody has fun.  Much more fun than can be had in public club.  Now, all the worry, and planning, searching the internet, and tallying of random strangers opinions, are not going to change these two outcomes.  What ever is going to happen is going to happen.  And if Scenario A happens and you do all wind up at the Spearmint Rhino or something, your worries are not all over.

vegas,38a3km,pattywayne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:33:09 2015 UTC,"Nevada doesn't care where the car is titled for the purposes of registration.  Title is title to NV DMV.  If you did not specifically ask and pay for the switching of the title, then it will stay in California.    Hopefully you've sent the CA plates back to CA and done the necessary paperwork with CA to remove the vehicle from their database so they won't try to charge you for next year's registration, and then fine you when you don't register.  It's happened to many.  Switching the title to NV will do this and is well worth the hassle of another trip to DMV."
vegas,38a3km,pattywayne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't specifically ask for the title to be transferred to NV but the DMV charged me a $29.25 fee for a Standard Title.

vegas,38a3km,hammockonthebeach,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"You're confusing registration with title.  Two separate things. If you were buying a car and making payments you could still register the car, but the bank holds the title, thus actually owning the car. Your situation is unique since you have a title-in-transfer.  When you bought the car, in CA, the owner should have signed over the title to you.  That would have been the paperwork you gave to NVDMV.  In your case, since your proof of ownership was a title-in-transfer, NV will issue you a clean title.  Your obligation to CA is done.  Welcome to Nevada, fellow recovering Californian.  My title took less than two weeks to arrive."

You gotta make the hay while the sun shines, if you can get more money, get after it.  I wouldn't worry about the kids, they are young, they will adjust and fit in to the new place and things before you know it.  The problem is you are going to have to adjust, you aren't going to have your parents around as built in baby sitters and emergency backups to watch the kids.

vegas,389d33,Four_Months,4,Tue Jun 2 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Not an immediate benefit, but your moving costs would be tax deductible.  IRS Form 3903.   Keep all your receipts.  Some things people forget about that can be deducted:  Your actual car mileage driving the 1600 miles from your old home to your new one.  Hotel expenses on the way.  The cost of disconnecting and connecting your utilities because of the move.  Short-term storage, parking fees, road tolls, and moving boxes/supplies.    That is in addition to the normal cost of professional movers, truck rental, etc etc.  Let Uncle Sam offset those moving costs for you.  You don't have to itemize your deductions to claim moving expenses.  Moving expenses are an adjustment to income, not an itemized deduction."
vegas,389d33,Four_Months,3,Tue Jun 2 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Not a teacher but I'm a professional who recently moved to Las Vegas   First things, find a place to stay.  Easier said than done my case; I spent almost 6 weeks looking for a place that met mine and my wife's criteria - near shopping, good high school, easy access to 95, and affordable.   I'm not sure what your living  preferences are (apartment, sfh, duplex, townhomes,) but do know the better priced (read as cheaper) properties go fast and be prepared to strike fast if a rental listing you like pops up on the market... for example with my current place  the listing went up on Friday afternoon. I called the listing agent and viewed the home at 5:30 pm on Monday. While walking through the home I asked questions and the most important one you should be asking is ""how many applications do you have for the property"". This is very important, because you can waste a lot of time and money looking at places that have pretty much been rented by the time you read the listing.  Also while on the subject of listings, if you choose to go the SFH route beware of websites like Craigslist, Zillow, Trulia... I learned some of the listings are ""stale"" and we're for Realtor marketing purposes only.   Apartments are another story, if you find a place you like read the reviews online. Also expect to pay more for less space. The apartment complexes in the part of town (NW - Centennial Hills/ Providence) I moved are a little pricey... $1165 for a 1200 sqft 3 bed room compared to a 3 bedroom 1700 sqft home with a garage for 1125 a month.   Be prepared to lay out some cash to get housings..  For my place I put down about $3K before I even signed the lease and got the keys, that includes application fees, security deposit, cleaning deposit,  pet deposit, and first months rent.   Also expect to pay at least $400 in utility deposits (1 month average of 1 years worth of power and water bill, and about 65 on gas service). Some of these deposits can be offset by getting a letter of reference from you local utility company.  Apartments tend to charge less for these sort of things, namely security deposits, but I've also heard horror stories of the cost incurred after move out by shady property management companies and they will nickel and dime you with stuff like pet rent, 1st floor premium fee, view premium fee... I could go on and on, but you get the gist.  As for the actual physical move, stay away from Uhaul. You're  much better shopping around with companies like budget truck rental amd penske. I used budget when I moved my family here from the Midwest and saved over $500 while getting a larger truck with more days to use it and unlimited miles through budget than what uhaul offered me with a veterans discount.  Also as far as furniture goes, unless it has sentimental value, don't bring it, I only say this because cheap furniture can be had at very good prices through Facebook buy and sell groups, craigslist, amd moving/divorce/ estate sales.  Hope this helps."

This means that you can't afford the nicer neighborhoods with nicer schools. I know that doesn't matter until the kids get into school, but just my thoughts. I don't have kids, but I wouldn't want to raise them here.   If you are in a pretty bad spot/rut in Missouri, then by all means come join us. The city has a lot to offer other than gambling. You will love the weather and miss the bbq.   Keep in mind we have some pretty low graduation rates. I really don't like the teachers that want all kids to go to college. In this city, casino dealers or bartenders can make more than us. It's not a very 'educated' city. I've only ever taught here, but that's my take coming from a transplant as well."

Moving from the ""south"" (if southern Missouri can be called that) to the west will be a gigantic culture shock. I've been in the south for 3 1/2 years now, so it was a culture shock for me coming down here. The weather in the west is a lot more sunny, less rain, no humidity, no tornadoes/hail/hurricanes/whatever else goes down where you're from. The architecture is different. The accents are different. The slang is different. The style of dress is different. The racial make up is different (white people are actually the minority). And vegas is a city of 2 million people. There are about 30 public high schools (meaning not counting magnet, private, or opportunity schools). Even more middle and elementary. Some of the high schools top 3000 kids. So you'd want to be specific about he school so people can give you a good heads up. Obviously some are good and some are bad. Mainly inner city vs. suburbs. Also, I don't want to scare you, but Vegas is also heavy on drugs. Kids do drugs in the schools, as young as middle school. Mostly weed and pills, but coke is actually common in the more affluent neighborhoods. Gangs and grafitti crews are actually a thing too. Mostly in the inner city, so I guess just do your research. If you plan on moving from southeast Missouri to Vegas, just be prepared for a complete 180 of the America you thought you knew."

The schools are much worse in some areas and comparable  in others. Depending on the town you are in, the difference could be pretty bad. Also - rent will be higher than you think which will eat some of the costs. I did a quick cost of living between Vegas and Springfield and 35K in MO would go as far as 41K out here."

They do it because last time I looked, Las Vegas receives 27 million visitors a year., the average visitor doesn't know where they're going, and in the case of the strip, most passengers don't realize that taking the freeway is not the ideal way... Also with kickbacks from strip clubs and the old boy network mentality, I think the vegas taxicab culture is less customer oriented than it has any right to be."

vegas,383tqv,sirwolf,2,Mon Jun 1 17:49:15 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  Sometimes the threat of calling them is enough to get the cabbie to change his tune.
vegas,383tqv,kewidogg,23,Mon Jun 1 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry apparently I'm bad at reddit and I don't know how to add the story to the original post...   I had a 6 am flight out this morning. I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel. I've been to Vegas 40+ times and I know the city like the back of my hand. I got in a cab this morning and said that I was headed to the airport, flying out with Southwest. The cab driver said OK.   The fastest route to the airport from HRH is a left on Harmon and a right on Paradise. HRH is on the corner of Harmon and Paradise and it's a straight shot to the airport. It was 5:15 am and traffic was VERY light. The cab driver pulls out and instead of going left, he makes a right. I quickly say, ""You're supposed to make a left here, and a right on Paradise."" He responds with, ""I came from that direction, there's an accident, road's closed, traffic blocked off."" And I was like, ""I don't think so, you were supposed to make a left on Harmon."" He said, ""I will make a left on Koval and go that way.""  So I was sitting there fuming - I was a single girl travelling with luggage and a bug pillow and maybe he thought I was a new tourist  and he tried to take advantage. I took down the cab number, his license, the cab company name, and a screenshot on my phone when we got to the corner of Koval and Harmon (the screenshot linked above).   When we got to the intersection of Tropicana and Paradise, I looked back at Paradise road and there was ZERO traffic, NO ACCIDENT and NOTHING blocked off.   The total fare was $13.50 when it should have been $7-8. I immediately called the cab commission to report it, they told me to try and resolve with the cab company itself. So I called the cab company, and they said, ""The fare is reasonable for the distance from HRH to the airport, no action will be taken.""   I called back the taxicab commission and they said that the fare was ""within range and reason"" so they won't do anything either.  I think this was an intentional con - Southwest is the closest terminal from HRH so my best guess is that the cab driver intentionally took a longer route to the ""airport"", knowing he'd make an extra ~$5 but that the cost would stay low enough that it wouldn't seem suspicious.  (Had I flown out of another airline, such as Virgin, the route would have been longer.)  Anyway - I just wanted to share my experience, I know the difference is $5 but it's the principle of the matter. Any tips for next time?"
vegas,383tqv,sirwolf,60,Mon Jun 1 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Honest cab driver here. I have a few tips...   Let them know right up front that you have been there before. Even if you haven't. This really annoys the shit out of me, but I know why people do it: Have your navigation system routed and the volume turned up. If you are going to the strip, between Mandolay Bay and the Stratosphere, you should never get on the highway. Find a few cabbies that you can trust and take their cards. We love repeat business, at least those of use trying to make an honest buck. I hate to say it, but it's true, if you think you are being long-hauled, you probably are. This isn't always true, I have had some people swear that I was cheating them when I was saving them money. If you tell the cabbie to go left, he HAS to go left. I tell people that as long as the meter is running I'll go anyway you want."

vegas,383tqv,sirwolf,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:45:06 2015 UTC,"question, I'm not all for Uber because I understand that the hurdles are different, and that isn't fair, but is there a reason why normal taxicab companies don't have competitive services?(order a ride from an app, driver ratings, etc)  Just wondering, I'm admittedly ignorant of the industry and curious to hear your perspective on the recent Vegas decision to allow Uber to operate here."
vegas,383tqv,sirwolf,6,Mon Jun 1 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, longer answer. About three months ago the TA came out with a new, black medallion we call Geo2.   These medallions are stationed at local casinos like Boulder, Sam's Town, and Texas Station, as well as South Point, GVR, and Red Rock, which are local/tourist.  In my company, we are paid differently and are expected to take every call we get sent, even if it is an unprofitable call for a regular cab. 10 companies participated and there is a special number that the customer can call for service.  I'm not really sure how this worked out. In some areas I know it had a positive effect, but in others, not so much.  Now they are coming out with an app. I haven't seen it yet, they are in trial, about 30 cabs from our company are trialing it.   The way business is done now is totally different than the way it was done when a lot of these old dogs set up shop. Then it was cut thoat and dirty. Today it still cut throat, but that needs to change. We need to be more cooperative and less driven solely by money. It will take a very long time for that to filter down to some of these, but I see reason to hope."
vegas,383tqv,AyoTrevz,5,Tue Jun 2 01:16:12 2015 UTC,"I started to try to answer this and it got way long. The short answer is that the companies are trying to respond competitively, there is an app out there now, but it is an entire shift in the paradigm of how we do business. I will try to answer more fully when I have time."
vegas,383tqv,sirwolf,2,Mon Jun 1 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer - and I definitely know there are good cab drivers out there! We had a great one driving from the LVCC to Palazzo - he was funny and kind and told us stories about his family :)  I always try to tip well (that trip I rounded up to $20 on a $14 ride) because I know it's not always an easy job.  My question - I usually only do short trips around the strip when I need to get from point A to B (like Wynn to Cosmo, or Planet Hollywood to Venetian). Is it really worth your time (as a cab driver) to make a trip out of your way to pick up a passenger for a ~$12-15 fare?"
vegas,383tqv,BlueberryQuick,5,Mon Jun 1 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"There are certain cabs that only work the strip. They don't make huge book (total dollars for the shift) but they make up for it in number of trips and tips. Those are the guys stationed at all the casinos.  Usually when I get a call I am within 3 miles. I personally don't think about whether a trip is ""worth it"" unless it is way unbalanced, say if I have to drive six or seven miles for a 2 mile ride. If I do my job and make you laugh a couple of times I'll get a decent tip!  But it's not the passengers fault where I have to drive from, and I don't say anything.   By the way, you over tipped that son of a bitch. If he took you the long way he should not have gotten a buck."

(A few weeks ago) Then mention that you stayed there a few times, ""but not every time"".   But seriously, if it were me I might say ""Look, I know you probably don't long haul, but just to be safe, I would appreciate it if you took X Street to get to the hotel.

vegas,383tqv,FUCK_YEAH_BASKETBALL,8,Mon Jun 1 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Uber provides competition, which incentivizes better service, but don't for one second think that Uber drivers are any less shady than cab drivers.  Just this past weekend I got long-hauled by an UberX driver in LA, during a 2x fare surge no less.  Sure I can give him a low rating, but where do I go from there?  He's not an Uber employee, he's an independent contractor.  There is no ""Uber Authority"" that provides any government oversight or control over how they do business.  If you tell an Uber driver to go left and he goes right with some bullshit story, what recourse do you have?"
vegas,383tqv,ericrz,8,Mon Jun 1 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed that Uber drivers can have shady tendencies as well. That said, their customer service - which they hire a team for in each location - is light years ahead of the Taxi companies. Here in Dallas I had an uber driver take me a half hour in the wrong direction just out of general incompetence (I didn't know the area at all at the time). They refunded my card for the entire ride in full. I've also been long-hauled seemingly on purpose a couple times, and had Uber make it right immediately both times. And for what it's worth, my drunk idiot friend left his phone in an uber on the way to the Dallas Mavericks game with me and the driver brought it back to him the next morning no charge.  I've never been met by much more than a ""go fuck yourself"" from Yellow Cab here in any situation that needed customer support. I mean, I'm talking guys who would feign like they were coming to pick me up but never did just because it was a short fare (making me 1.5 hours late for work)."
vegas,383tqv,sketchy1poker,6,Tue Jun 2 00:15:23 2015 UTC,How did you get long hauled by an uber?  Don't they give you the route and cost upfront?

vegas,383tqv,Greydmiyu,3,Tue Jun 2 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"If you tell an Uber driver to go left and he goes right with some bullshit story, what recourse do you have?   If you leave the driver a 1- or 2-star rating, and indicate the reason as ""inefficient route"" (can't remember the app's exact wording), Uber customer service will likely email you, and probably offer a partial refund.  Has happened to me a few times.  On my most recent Uber trip (DC), I had the worst driver ever.  Picked us up in the wrong spot, took the wrong route, and asked me to pay the tolls.  I let Uber know, and they refunded the entire fare (~$30).  That's the difference.  As the OP pointed out, with a taxi, you have little to no recourse.  With Uber, you have plenty -- and because the route is GPS-tracked and tied to your account, Uber knows if you're telling the truth, at least when it comes to routing issues.  A customer should never have to pay for a ""long haul"" on Uber."

He's not an Uber employee, he's an independent contractor. There is no ""Uber Authority"" that provides any government oversight or control over how they do business.   ...this statement in a Reddit post where someone just described how a Taxi driver long hauled them, the company said it was fine, and the government oversight did bugger all about it.  What recourse does the OP have against the individual taxi driver?  None.  1-star rating vs. none.  Dunno about you, but the Uber seems to be an improvement in that case."

I didn't expect the commission and the company to completely dismiss my complaint though.  When I arrive in Vegas I - always - say to take Paradise & surface streets. Several years ago, I was travelling with a colleague to Vegas for a convention, and the cab driver, knowing we were in town for work and would expense it, long hauled us from the airport to Hard Rock (coincidentally again...), taking the freeway route and running up the meter to over $30. I was too timid at the time to say anything until we were dropped off and my colleague learned something important that day."

I've even argued fares in other towns (once in Portland the driver took a highway that went over a bridge that was much further from the convention center than anyone else had taken). Fortunately we'd taken several cabs during that trip and knew within $1 what it would be (every time it was $8 give or take $1). So when we were driving we said ""hey, we've done this route every morning/night for the past 2 days, it's never been more than $9"" and the driver was chill and stopped the meter when we hit $7...it would have been at least double that had he kept it running"
vegas,383tqv,readytoascend,4,Mon Jun 1 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"The companies actually encourage long-hauling with their evaluation programs. We get evaluated based on the average your shift does that day. As soon as one cabbie long hauls it skews the average, making it harder for everyone else.  I have talked to a lot of guys that started out honest but quickly fell behind and had their jobs threatened. As soon as they started long hauling all that went away.

vegas,388cn1,ErnDizzy,3,Tue Jun 2 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"First bit of advise:  Always books direct with the hotel.  ARIA has package deals too! Check here: http://aria.mgmresortsvacations.com/  That way you can get Mlife points for booking with the hotel rather than Expedia. Which may lead to more free play.  The front desk agent should be able to look up your players card info, but it's always good to have your card before you check in. This would just speed up the process and get you to your room (and on the casino floor) faster!  Also, you will need a players card to redeem anything from MyVegas. Be sure to read the fine print on what you redeem too. MyVegas has really tightened up their offerings. So if you want to redeem two buffets at Bellagio, but are staying at ARIA, they won't accept it. You can only redeem if you are a guest of that hotel.   Oh, and also get your rewards BEFORE you get to Vegas. MyVegas uses location based offers. Us locals, playing within X amount of miles from Vegas get crap offers and very 'expensive' offers. Where as when I went to San Diego a few weeks ago, the offers are completely different and much more attractive. So redeem anything you want before you get to Vegas."
vegas,388cn1,TwisterII,2,Tue Jun 2 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"No. No. No.  Don't do a ""$50 trick"".    People doing a $50 trick is why the $20 trick doesn't work.  Just stop. Now.  and since you are booking through expedia there isn't much ""trick"" the front desk is going to do for you anyways"
vegas,388cn1,Four_Months,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Booking through Expedia won't get you any Mlife points or credit or anything, as someone else mentioned, you need to book through the hotel directly. You'll probably find comparable or even cheaper rates anyways.   That being said, it won't really matter if you get your Mlife card before you check in, as you won't be getting and points for the room, just anything you charge to the room. However, it could matter for the following - Pro tip: Charge EVERYTHING you can to the room (you can charge almost anything at any MGM property to your room - bars, restaurants, pool, etc). That way you'll get Mlife tier credits for it (25 points per $1 I believe)."

They will generally focus on pulling data and building reports for managers.  An example might be the casino has a certain offer they want to send out to customers who's theoretical loss per day is between X and Y only.  It would be the analyst job to do that segmentation and provide the list.  When I worked as an analyst in a casino the slot analyst would have been more accurately called a casino analyst as they did support table games as well.  Definetly a good role that will grant good casino experience but don't expect to get paid very well, probably 40-45k if this is an MGM property."
vegas,386v2g,GETTINMONEYVEGAS,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldnt it be more like Database/Loyalty Marketing that would provide that segmentation? Or would we have separate databases with different info?  Also I've noticed there's a difference between ""Slot Analyst"" and ""Slot Marketing Analyst"". Looks like the regular Slot Analyst is more involved in the ops side.  Yes, I've heard this position is a really great stepping stone! That's what I would plan to use it as."
vegas,386v2g,GETTINMONEYVEGAS,2,Tue Jun 2 14:48:53 2015 UTC,From my experience there is no difference in slot marketing analyst vs. slot analyst other than who you report to.  The slot analyst will probably report to director or VP of slot ops while the marketing analyst will report to director of slot marketing.  In practice though I would say duties will be similar.  A property is usually not going to have a slot analyst and slot marketing analyst but maybe at a bigger property.

vegas,386v2g,Nierperfect,2,Tue Jun 2 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"The slot manufacturers keep their most popular games as ""lease"" or ""participation"" games meaning the casinos pay them a lease fee and don't actually own the machine or they pay them participation fees which would be a % of handle or win.  I would guess monitoring and auditing these fees would be a responsibility of a slot analyst.  That is just an example and I am sure there would be many other duties related to the slot manufacturers.  As to the slot floor, you would most likely have duties related to where placement of machines maximize profitability."

vegas,386v2g,tedistkrieg,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:26:02 2015 UTC,loyalty marketing generally creates the offers as a whole.  that's the group of people that is responsible for identifying which segments need attention.  they devise the promotions and offers to speak to each segment.  it's then up to the casino analyst to actually find the individual people in the database who are within that segment
vegas,386v2g,tedistkrieg,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:20:11 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense! Thanks for clarifying!   So Loyalty would be in charge of creating the specific promotion too (i.e. $500 Freeplay and $50F&B credit).
vegas,386v2g,tedistkrieg,2,Tue Jun 2 15:40:32 2015 UTC,"When I started as a Slot Marketing Analyst my duties involved.:  Running, assisting,  etc. Slot Tournaments. This involves creating the machine selection access database, recording scores, verifying scores, etc.  Running post event analysis on tournaments, giveaways, etc.  Providing creative feedback on direct markerting campaigns  Doing in depth player profitability analysis  Creating adhoc reports (where sql knowledge comes in handy big time)  Assisting the Slot Hosts with Marketing Lists, host production reports, etc.  When I was in the position I also handled operations related analyis as well (since then its now two separate positions).   For ops I ran slot machine profitability reports  Met with vendors  (at very nice lunches) w/ slot ops manager to discuss how the machines are doing and what new ones are coming  Sql is a pretty important aspect of the job, however I wouldnt say you need to be an expert or anything when you start.  I didnt even know what sql was prior to starting. I learned on the job.  Most of the sql driven reports have the sql code already created. But I stress to my analyst to learn and know wtf he is running. Some analysts will just run it, having no idea how it works, and hope to god no one asks any questions or asks for something to be modified. You wont be expected to know how to write stuff from scratch or anything though.  I learned from picking apart already created code. I think if you can learn simple basic sql (select blah blah from blah blah where blah blah group by blah blah) you'll do fine and be able to learn it as you go.  I find the number one skill needed is critical thinking. If i see something like  SELECT PlayerID, sum(Slot_Win) as Win,sum(slot_theowin) as Theo FROM PLAYER p  LEFT JOIN PLAYERDAY pd on pd.playerid=p.playerid WHERE Accountingdate>='06/01/2015' GROUP BY PLAYERID   I will go through it step by step.  Okay, its Selecting playerids, adding up slot win and theo win.  It is getting this information from the Player and Playerday tables...its connecting the playerday table on playerids and its getting the information from June 1st and on.  Hmm...group by, well the only thing in the group by is the only thing that isnt being summed. Group by PlayerId must mean I am grouping things based on Playerid.  I have had a few analysts who cannot for the life of them go through crap step by step...or even google stuff."

vegas,382nn6,DragonMLIB,3,Mon Jun 1 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"At table games, just place the cash on the table and the dealer will give you chips.  If you want a specific denomination, let them know.  If you need a larger chip broken down, place it on the table (outside of any betting areas) and ask for the denomination.  Never try to hand something directly to the dealer: place it on the table (they're not allowed to take anything from your hand).    Always allow the dealer to color-up when you leave the table (change your smaller chips into larger denominations).  However, it is considered bad form to color-up at other times, unless requested by the dealer.  For example, if you have a stack of 5s and are leaving the table, let the dealer give you 25s or 100s.  However, if you have a stack of 5s and are still playing, don't stop play to ask for 25s or 100s because you'll probably have to break it down again later.  Use the cashier to change your chips back into currency when you leave the casino.  Slots all have bill acceptors.  Just insert your bills and start playing.  When you collect, it will print a slip with a barcode on it.  This can be inserted into another slot machine (directly into the same bill acceptor), or cashed out at the cashier, or cashed out at one of the automated cash center machines that will be scattered around the casino.  I don't think dealers can accept slot slips, so change it to currency before you sit at a table.  If you're new to gambling, hang around any casino for a few minutes and watch what others are doing.  It's pretty easy to figure out on the fly."

vegas,382nn6,Stand17,2,Mon Jun 1 13:30:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, there is cheap blackjack all over the strip...$5, $10.  The casinos would like you to think this is a good deal, but it isn't.  The cheap tables are usually the tables where blackjack pays 6 to 5 instead of 3 to 2.  May seem like a small difference, but it's not.  The odds are 4x as bad.  So pretty much if you can afford to bet $10 at 6:5 table, you can afford to bet $25 at 3:2 table with a better chance of winning.  MGM Grand would definitely not have  a good game for $5.  However, for $25, they offer one of the best games on the strip (bj pays 3:2, stand on 17, surrender available, resplit Aces).  For cheaper tables ($5-$15) you can go to Hooter's, Treasure Island, Paris, The Trop, Circus circus, etc. to name a few.  sorry to say the strip has gone to crapjack these last few years.

If you head downtown The D and El Cortez (and a few smaller ones) should have some 5 dollar tables. Hooters is also a good place to try on the strip.  You ""buy"" your chips from the table. Then, when you play, you sell them back to the cage. Pro-tip: When you are ready to leave the table, ask the deal to ""color me up"" and give them your chips. They take all your chips and convert them into the biggest ones they can. A lot easier to carry 2 black hundred dollar chips than 40 reds or whatever. Slots just take cash (bills only, ain't no one got time for change) into the machine, then it prints a voucher with your winnings.  You can take your voucher to other slots or trade in at the ATM/Voucher cashing machines, or take it to the cage as well.

Unfortunately black cats and kittens are the least likely to be adopted. If you know anyone that might be thinking of adopting, please consider one of these sweeties. One is a boy and one is a girl. The girl is more vocal and a bit of a drama queen. She will definitely be a lap cat. The boy is more mellow, but still very lovely.  They will be fostered until they weigh a pound and a half. Probably 2 to 3 weeks. If anyone is interested let me know and I will give you their ID number and let you know when they will be back at the shelter.  Thanks everyone!"

They have some of the best table games odds (If you know where to look).  For example, they have European Roulette for $25.  This means there is one 0.  The house edge is cut in half!  Would you rather bet $12.50 on a double 0 roulette, or would you rather bet $25 on single 0 roulette?  Even though you expect to lose the same money, i say the second option is more fun!  Okay right next to those single 0 roulette wheels, you have one of the best blackjack games on the strip: 6 deck, bj pays 3 to 2, dealer stands on 17, surrender allowed, resplit aces allowed.  House Edge is only .3%.  Wow!  and only for $25?  best deal on the strip really.  They used to have more good blackjack for cheaper, but they got rid of them and replaced them with blackjack paying 6 to 5.  So sad.  I guess if you want cheaper blackjack go across to Hooter's.  Okay, at night time you can go to Hakkasan, many hot girls there.  Okay, I just gave you a ton of things to do without even leaving your hotel.  Just walk down the strip.  Also go to downtown.

Mather point is the most touristy lookout but honestly I didn't mind so much because the views were so beautiful. you can drive around the canyon and get out at different lookouts or hike a short way down and back some of the trails for a bit of a more intimate view. when you enter the park you will be handed a little brochure and a map which are very useful. then when you're ready to leave just prepare for another 5 hours driving back!"

I got to experience it through a corporate event, they had us start with a video/PowerPoint presentation, which covered safety, how to drive the course, and don't crash their cars.  Then we went into a simulation room, where they had a video game setup.  It had a steering wheel, pedals, and was setup to simulate the track you are about to drive on.  We each got time on it with an employee telling us when to brake, accelerate, turn and so on.  Getting in the actual car was a blast.  We got the video also, its from inside the car, which is boring to watch.  I would have liked the video to contain speed information, like how fast I was going, instead you just see the back of my head and the instructers.  The audio is muffled, and mostly what you hear is the instructor telling you to brake, turn, accelerate etc.  It did come on a flash drive that looks like a race car, that was neat.  I definitely recommend doing it.  I can now die saying I got to drive a Ferrari, its expensive and if you want to save a few bucks, you can skip the video."

The Rio has a ton of parking as do the Palms (across the street) and Gold Coast (next door).   The Rio is also not on the Strip. It's about 3/4 of a mile from it.

vegas,37tahq,lasvegaslocal,10,Sat May 30 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"God the taxi industry is so buttmad. Evolve or die, I say."
vegas,37tahq,FinnTheDogg,9,Sat May 30 09:50:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this lately. It's just another story in a line of ""we don't need to cater to our customers, they have to use us."" Until something challenges that, and by then the business is already out of the game. See: USPS, Blockbuster, etc.   Here's the thing though - and I say this never having actually having taken an Uber ride anywhere - every taxi I've ever gotten into has been pretty disgusting. Cracked, broken leather seats, slight funk, etc., and I always feel like I may potentially be ripped off.   But, in the past, there wasn't really a market for cab services; you called whichever one was listed first in the yellow pages/Google, or hailed whatever one was at the airport.   Now, there are options, and the cab companies have to look at competing in this market like any other business.   If I were a taxi company CEO, I'd start differentiating my company ASAP. Think amenities. Customer service. High standards. No more crappy, gross cabs; go with nice ones inline with limo services. Train the drivers to ask friendly questions, ""Hi, how are you today? Do you have a preferred route you'd like to go? Can I help answer any questions about Las Vegas?"" And of course -- an app to order the car. They should want their customers to get to the airport and say ""No thanks, I'll wait for the next Yellow cab available.""   It'll be interesting to see how things play out now."
vegas,37tahq,trshtehdsh,5,Sat May 30 18:24:08 2015 UTC,"Uber is present here in Chicago, and it's great. It's huge competition and the taxis are still scuzzy and gross.   I told a cabbie my destination and he tried to drop me a couple miles from it.   ""Okay we are here""  ""...I said six corners. This is not six corners. Do you not know where six corners is??"" (A very common / popular nightlife destination here in the city)  ""..oh okok""  We got there, and suddenly his credit card machine doesn't work - which by law here the cab shouldn't be on the road, told him that I don't have cash and then suddenly it was working again..  It's the same shit everywhere and I would've taken an Uber if the surge pricing wasn't active."

Spray the whole car with a protector and wipe it down as they go. The inside they'll wipe down and use an air compressor to take the dust out the vents then wipe it down again. Its a very thorough service for the twenty they charge for a car. Its a longer wait and you do have to wait outside but they're work is great.

Heck you coiuld get a cabana at planet Hollywood Which is a more fun pool anyway for.600-700 as a minimum spend. You'll get all the stuff incl.in the caesers plus have about 650/worth of 'free' food and drink."
vegas,37lyro,jrbevis,2,Thu May 28 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"I'd pass on this. It's going to be more than $450 when you add everything in. You can spend that money on an awesome show or spa treatment.   Also, 104 in Vegas really isn't that bad at all. You'll find it's pretty comfortable to lay out in that, plus the pools at Caesars are surrounded on all sides by the hotel towers, so they get a lot of shade early in the day and as it starts to get later."
vegas,37lyro,WebDesignBetty,1 point,Thu May 28 21:09:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the timing advice. I think it'll be comfortably warm. Just can't wait to relax.
vegas,37lyro,sea13,1 point,Thu May 28 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"104 is two degrees lower than the average high in July(106). In your opinion when is it ""bad""?"
vegas,37lyro,sea13,1 point,Fri May 29 02:42:55 2015 UTC,It could easily also be 116 in July. That's so hot your eyeballs are hot when you go outside.

vegas,37lyro,MatticusXII,2,Wed Jun 3 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"If you want a day of luxury, the cabana at Caesars is the way to go. Ask for Leo as your cabana host. Then saunter up to the pool bar and have Kevin, the bartender, whip you up a black and blue lemonade. I stay at Caesars every time I am in Vegas and their service is second to none. Also, go back and read previous reddit posts about slipping $20 to your front desk host to get a room upgrade. Works like a charm."

We already have Laurel Collection king accommodations, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to try to get an Augustus Tower luxury room.  We'll definitely try the black and blue lemonade."

So if someone brings you towels you have to tip, girl brings you a coca-cola you have to tip and so one.. In the end your total cost will be significantly higher than $450 just keep in that mind."
vegas,37lyro,cire1184,4,Fri May 29 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"Think of everything else you could spend 1/2 a $1000 on.   Are you really planning on spending the entire day outside by the pool? That's hard to do - and I live here and I'm guessing I'm more used to the heat. You'll certainly feel obligated to spend the entire day outside, if you spend all that money.   I'm just thinking of how hot it is in July. I'd either be in the pool, or indoors, myself."
vegas,37lyro,notmyrealnam3,4,Thu May 28 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"don't forget they will have complete shade, a ceiling fan, and sprinkler cooling system which could make it more bearable."
vegas,37lyro,notmyrealnam3,2,Thu May 28 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate this perspective. Though we're tolerant of hot weather, feeling obligated to stay at the pool all day (or I'd feel bad) for $600+ if you include everything just seems... not worth it. We're already staying in the nice tower and we just might want to be there, inside, instead. And would I rather take half that money and get a really nice treatment at Qua? Oh, absolutely."
vegas,37o39c,Stringphoneinventor,4,Fri May 29 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"If you were older I'd say you definitely should be getting 2 rooms for 4 guys, but you're 21, and your money would definitely be better spent outside of your hotel room. Especially if one side is worried that it will make them a little uncomfortable money-wise.   Get the 2 rooms and use that extra money to party your balls off, will be much better well spent."
vegas,37o39c,camaro2ss,5,Fri May 29 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm always the one advocating for spending as little on hotel rooms as possible.  BUT, in this situation, I say get the two rooms.  Yes, it's going to cost more, but if one guy gets lucky, you don't want everyone to be sexiled."

vegas,37o39c,MaxTheDog90210,2,Fri May 29 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to vegas in a group of 4 guys. We got 1 room with 2 queen beds. We have no issue sharing a bed, they're big enough that you won't be spooning each other all night. 2 twins would likely not work.  Since our stay includes a Saturday, our room costs ~$350-$400 during our time there. That money could be put to much better use other places than a room we'll be in for as little as possible during our trip.  That's our opinion anyway.  Also, you may be able to get a suite somewhere with 3-4 beds, or 2 beds + a pull out couch, etc. for the price of two rooms. Worth looking into as you'd also have better amenities in the room."
vegas,37o39c,karibear909,2,Fri May 29 15:28:02 2015 UTC,Upvoted for grammar.
vegas,37o39c,jrshaul,2,Fri May 29 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"If you guys were just coming out for a night or two I'd say just do one room, but 5 days is a lot, plus you have to account for having just one room and 4 guys needing to get ready to go out everyday. If you're already having a split decision, just go with 2 rooms. That way you'll avoid any conflict that might be brought on by grumpiness after 5 days. Just pick which things you care about spending the most money on, and then cut corners with the other stuff. The biggest thing you can save money on is buying alcohol and drinking in the room as you get ready and if you walk the strip, having your own drinks with you then too. Idk, that's just my opinion though, like I said a couple of days would have been okay with one room, but 5 days you're gonna want more space."

The owner is passionate about introducing paintball all new players, encourages the safety and awareness about the sport and the markers used, and will even sit down and have a slice of pizza with you.  They are the longest existing indoor paintball facility in Vegas.    Xtreme paintball. Best outdoor and industry standard paintball field for competitive play. Also has a very large recreation/scenario field. Same as Bonehead's owner, the owner of Xtreme is passionate about the team sport of paintball and will help with any maintenance questions with your marker. They keep their fields clean and organize local tournaments for competitive play. The place also has a balcony area for overhead viewing.    There is a social stigma that paintball is a violent sport, yet the team work and relationships I've built from playing competitive games with fellow players is something I'm humbled by the players themselves. Many are willing to introduce you to the sport, help you better your body positioning against a bunker, and help you learn how to snap shoot during the break from home base. Mix adrenaline, team play, and having fun - paintball is a sport which deserves more credit than how society sees it.    Rock climbing. We have four indoor climbing gyms throughout the valley. All owned by passionate local climbers. Our climbing community is amazing. From bouldering to rope climbs (top or lead), our indoor gyms provide many options for climbers to experience when the weather doesn't permit climbers to be outdoors. Or even if you're new to climbing or do not like the outdoors, but looking to add a new physical activity to your schedule.    Game Nights. Our local game shops hold game nights for people to try new board games or play in a role playing game. We have more places for fellow geeks to gather and have fun.

vegas,37jom3,Chipware,2,Thu May 28 02:59:13 2015 UTC,The pizza place down the street from me has this clover. According to them it depends on your infrastructure. If you have multiple restaurant locations it isn't efficient. He also said it was slow when it was crazy busy. If you have a stand alone system that doesn't get too busy then it can work fine.   Otherwise I think aloha and micros are the two big ones out there. Also infogenesis but that gets pricier.

There is a topshop there too which you will probably like if you like the other stores mentioned.   The Nordstrom and saks there usually have plenty of sale stuff to look through  I wouldn't say its crammed with tourists but if I'm going I try to go on a weekday when it's not so busy.

vegas,37hy4d,Netsuai,2,Wed May 27 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Fashion Show does have higher end customers in mind. They still have Macy's men and women stores. And their prices are normal. It has a huge Forever 21 store there (assuming most H&M shoppers go here to). Good people watching because many tourists do shop there.    The Las Vegas Premium outlet on Charleston is good as well. So are the stores in the Las Vegas outlet on LV Blvd. And some stores are the same but different inventory; like Kenneth Cole, I nabbed same style work shoes but different colors from their stores.    Downtown Summerlin will have similar stores as what you will find at Town Square, but they do have their own Macy's and other niche stores.    There's also the outlet mall out in Primm if you don't mind the 45 min drive.    Are you seeking good deals for your dollar or just want to shop?"

My advice is to check if your bank supports texts on transactions. I get a text message any time my card is ran, from declined transactions to card-not-present, etc. That way if you see something pop up you weren't expecting, you can notify your bank right away.  If you need to use cash/debit for something, it might be best to stop by an ATM at one of your bank's branches and just withdraw it there. Other than that, it sounds like you have a good handle on things, you were just unlucky. Hope everything is resolved soon. It's a huge mess getting everything taken care of."

vegas,379o81,boootyshorts,8,Tue May 26 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"That sucks. Just some advice - I personally don't use debit for anything. You should really consider using a credit card instead of debit. Debit takes the money straight out of your account, but with credit cards, if fraudulent activity appears and you report it right away, the company will investigate and reverse the charges. Your money stays safely untouched."
vegas,379o81,dee_in_3d,6,Tue May 26 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"Same goes with a card endorsed by visa or mastercard, regardless of debit or credit card. As long as the purchased is not pin based you can contact yourbbank and file an electronic claim. Even in cases of a cloned card number, the cardholder can file for fraudulent card activity."
vegas,379o81,boootyshorts,1 point,Tue May 26 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. just to be clear you mean transactions where the vendor runs the debit card as ""credit"" and a signature is captured at the time of purchase, rather than punching in the PIN?  But if people use the debit/PIN option then they don't have the protections?"
vegas,379o81,dee_in_3d,1 point,Tue May 26 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"I read up a bit, so our charges were run as credit thus no pin number so we will hopefully get our cash back pretty quick. If a pin is used and fraudulent the consumer can be on the hook for $50 if reported in a couple days."
vegas,379o81,spilk,1 point,Tue May 26 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, but usually the financial institution will deny the claim because in order for a pin based transaction to be successful, the person completing the transaction has to have both card and pin number.  Cloned cards are only ran under credit."
vegas,379o81,Netsuai,2,Tue May 26 02:17:39 2015 UTC,the ATM skimmers out there these days have cameras to capture you entering your PIN. I would not be surprised to see cloned cards being used in PIN transactions.

Let him/her know that you're interested in the position of front desk and that you're a quick learner. Also note that while you don't have sales experience or any experience for that matter, you are dependable and won't let them down. Yadda yadda yadda. That job has a bit of a high turn-over rate at the front desk due to the minimum wage and the amount of work you do but I think it's a really good first job due to the different things you're doing and all the multitasking. Stay there long enough and I think you can move on up to other positions such as that. Possibly in the casinos.   Good luck."

They hire just about anybody, the work is relatively easy, and they have such a high turnover rate that it seldom takes long to get let in. Best thing you can do with any retail job like that is follow up on your application. Call in, ask to speak to their hiring personnel, and ask if your app has been reviewed. It's how I got hired in the first place. More so than anything it counts as experience, which is a plus.  Personally my first job was at Marie Callendar's (Rainbow and Cheyenne) as a pie maker, eventually moved up and did that plus hosting, cashier, bussing, occasionally serving, and sometimes prep work or cooking."

vegas,378ufp,WebDesignBetty,2,Tue May 26 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"Make a list of all the retail places around you. Look on google maps and/or drive by. Writing this down is important. Start with a radius around your house.  Apply to every one of those places. Check first to see if they have an online employment area. If not, go in person with a resume and ask for an application.   That resume had better not have typos in it! Have a few people read it over for you before you print/send them out. I recommend you print that resume on nice paper. Go to staples printing department and see if they have a nice linen style.   When you go in, either to fill out the application or for interview, dress like you're going in to work, or slightly better. Clothes should be clean, unstained and wrinkle free. Your hair should be short and trimmed. No facial hair. Remove any earrings or piercings. Cover tattoos when possible. Trim your nose hair and ear hair. Clean under your fingernails. Do not wear cologne. Wear deodorant. Don't smell. Brush your teeth right before you go. Do not wear sunglasses on your head or hanging off your shirt. Do not wear a hat. Wear appropriate undergarments. Wear nice shoes (they usually don't get noticed - but old and dirty shoes do.) If you wear glasses, they should be clean.   These things may seem obvious, but having interviewed people over the years, you'd be surprised.  Practice shaking hands and speaking confidently and clearly. Smile.  If you get an interview, research the company before you go. Be prepared with a few questions to ask the interviewer. I saw a great list on Reddit of some general questions. Find that. Ask for a business card from your interviewer. Write a thank you note after the interview. Not sure if snailmail is still the standard for this, but it does show extra effort.   Do you have any hobbies or interests? Try and pursue that. If you play an instrument, apply at a music store. You don't have work experience, but your general music experience works. Or, if you play a lot of video games or on computers, that can work for you in a GameStop or similar."

So the following resource is from Canada, but it is produced by government, so its not trying to sell you anything. Check out: http://alis.alberta.ca/worksearch/resumes.html. There are some really nice tips on there, and I think they would still be relevant to the job market in the US. In particular, check out the functional resume under resume types. Functional resumes are awesome for those with limited work experience. Good luck on your work search! As I tell my clients here of all ages - perseverance is the key to landing a job, just stick with it. Also be very self critical - how are you dressed when approaching employers for example?

vegas,378y4l,luckbags,1 point,Tue May 26 16:46:04 2015 UTC,Just take the shuttle... they are cheaper and go to the Mirage and others. Tip the shuttle driver.
vegas,378y4l,spec209,0,Tue May 26 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"I upvote the shuttle.  Cheaper, upfront fixed cost.  If they drop a few other passengers off at other properties first, look at it like you are getting a short free tour."
vegas,378y4l,Four_Months,1 point,Tue May 26 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"i personally wouldn't take the shuttle even if i was alone, but that is the only time it makes any sense.  if you are 2 or 3 people you'll pay more than a taxi for a way less convenient service"
vegas,378y4l,notmyrealnam3,1 point,Tue May 26 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"Once you get to your hotel, how much does it cost to have somebody drive you up and down the strip for a quick look around?"
vegas,378y4l,Four_Months,1 point,Tue May 26 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"ok - so it sounds like you find value in the tour/milkrun aspect of the shuttle - i don't.  But that's ok, both services are available so we can both choose what we like.      sorry if you thought it was an attack on what you like, but this is a thread about taxi tips... you mentioned the shuttle and i (like you) thought i'd throw in my 2 cents/opinion... it's kinda how this works i think"
vegas,378y4l,notmyrealnam3,-1,Tue May 26 22:08:00 2015 UTC,"If you go through the tunnel and on to the freeway you are being ""longhauled"".  Cabbies are notorious for doing this here in Vegas.  They can make an extra $15-$30 off of longhauling you from the airport."

But do keep an eye out here as a few rental or roommate opportunities do pop up.    Other option would be the extended stay places.

vegas,375naf,RaifBear,6,Mon May 25 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I did have Seattle in between....  Vegas can take time to grow on you. All at once it's terribly cosmopolitan and just a tweak weird all at once. Even though it's one of the top 10 foodie cities in America and a top tourist destination worldwide, it's still only ~2M residents. It's a little shocking how small the place can be at times (""Oh, you know so-and-so?"" Um yeah). You'll get used to the slot machines at the grocery store, I promise. Smiths is our Kroger. Trader Joe's has better parking than that postage stamp sized lot on South Hulen. If you like to drink, check out Total Wine. Be sure to give a shout if there's something I might help you find.  Welcome and good luck."

Airports can still require a permit for pickup/drop off so there will still probably be an airport fee when Uber'ing There doesn't seem to be any language about regulating pickup/drop off in the Strip corridor. Makes me worry about traffic stacking up even worse around places like the Bellagio fountains, the LINQ, or the porte-cocheres at places with hot megaclubs like MGM, Caesars, Cosmo or Wynncore."
vegas,3701wa,yeahHedid,11,Sat May 23 19:19:13 2015 UTC,Right. They HAVE to stop pickups from the main strip. If uber is allowed to do that it's going to completely fuck up traffic.
vegas,3701wa,DevilsAdvocate77,1 point,Sat May 23 23:03:43 2015 UTC,why would traffic be any worse on the strip? It's not like Uber coming in means more people needing a ride. It'll just be in different vehicles.
vegas,3701wa,DrkHeart,13,Sun May 24 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"Taxis queue up in an orderly first-come, first-served system.  The newer resorts have dedicated taxi staging areas based built right into their entrances based around this concept.  Having multiple unmarked private cars rolling up on-demand, each to pick up a specific person, is going to create chaos on the driveways.  Can you imagine trying to get in or out of Cosmopolitan on a Saturday night with 50 UberX cars all trying to figure out who is supposed to be picking up who?  If the city doesn't ban it, I bet the resorts will just do it themselves."
vegas,3701wa,amyg2g,3,Sun May 24 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"To add on to the comment by /u/DevilsAdvocate77 - the resort corridor is not set up for curbside-anywhere pick-up/drop off. There's no on-street parking on or anywhere close to The Strip, there are no breakdown lanes/areas on LV Blvd, and traffic is either going 40-45 when volume is low or it needs every single lane to be moving when volume is high. Uber drivers crawling the right lanes looking for their fares and stopping to load/unload would be just throwing the biggest bag of spanners into the Strip traffic situation.  The other issue is; where are all the loitering Uber drivers going to be when they're not on a fare? Taxis stack up at the various taxi stands at the casinos and out of the traffic flow. Ubers would either be constantly orbiting The Strip or - I would guess - picking a relatively close surface lot (Behind Excalibur/Luxor, the big lot at the LINQ) to park up at since casino parking garages can be very time consuming to get in and out of."

Given the worst case scenarios of what could happen (Wreck a $$$$$ exotic, crash into a party bus full of tourists, etc), $1.5MM is not wholly out of the question.  Also, the relevant section states ""Every transportation network company or driver"" so presumably it's Uber that's footing that bill for drivers when they're ""on the clock."" Here it is - Section 10, pt. 3 - The ""Transportation Network Company"" is required to continuously provide the required amount of insurance if the driver's insurance lapses or does not meet the legal requirements."

The relatively higher releases this week compared to last week just means that irrigators are starting to divert more water from the river again. The area South of us here in Vegas had quite a bit of rain which caused irrigators to cut their water use which then caused Lake Havasu, Mohave, and Mead to cut their releases. This ultimately led to the relatively flat Lake Mead water levels as another poster on this thread put it."

vegas,371fbc,deademery,1 point,Sun May 24 18:22:42 2015 UTC,Uber made it impossible to request a car if you were on the strip or at the airport. They did it voluntarily when they launched in Vegas because allowing airport and strip pick ups would've made it more likely they would have been shut down. My guess would be that now that officially legislation has passed (and will probably be signed) that they will start allowing strip/airport pick ups.

They are commonly found between sections of buildings, bridges, sidewalks, railway tracks, piping systems, ships, and other structures.  Building faces, concrete slabs, and pipelines expand and contract due to warming and cooling from seasonal variation, or due to other heat sources. Before expansion joint gaps were built into these structures, they would crack under the stress induced.

vegas,36y0tx,MojaveLife,3,Sat May 23 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"""Projects in Las Vegas such as Resorts World Las Vegas, the MGM-AEG arena and the Global Business District from Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, as well as other construction statewide, are expected to create an 18-percent increase of jobs to 60,000 new positions.""  Most of these positions, like the ones created by the opening of the CityCenter complex a few years ago, will be lower paid service sector jobs.   Interestingly, LVRJ uses Wedgie to run the poll that accompanies this article. Wedgie is based right here in Vegas and they are hiring, thou only skilled programmer positions mostly. Still if the Vegas tech ecosystem becomes more established, it could lead to the creations of a lot more skill based jobs here, much like how tech has been driving job growths in SLC, San Jose, Raleigh etc."
vegas,36y0tx,dtlv5813,5,Sat May 23 05:48:50 2015 UTC,"Vegas is just a shitty town for newcomers period and I'm sure most of this sub will agree, but I disagree with the notion that Vegas is one of the worst cities for finding a job.   Not to be negative, but everything in this town from getting a job, renting a house, to getting a new license, registering kids for school is a pain and a matter of who you know.  Talking to locals, I get it...  transients and starry-eyed dreamers seem to flock to the bright lights of the Strip in ever increasing numbers only to find crushed dreams when they arrived because they can't find a job they want.   I understand unemployment is higher than the national average, but at the same time I see an abundance of help wanted signs at almost every food service and retail establishment I go to, so saying finding a job is difficult in Vegas is B.S. because if you have the right education and skill set you'll be able to find a job just like I did 3 months ago."

You can pay for a shuttle, but they'll most likely be stopping at other places along the way to drop people off (depending on who else is on your shuttle) so sure you could save a few bucks by taking a shuttle, but it's easier and much faster just to grab a taxi. People always complain about the taxi line at LAS, but it moves super fast.    As far as Omnia, it depends, but your best bet for getting in through a promoter would probably be that Sunday night since it would be less busy than a Friday or Saturday night. The fact that you at least have an even ratio (one guy and one girl) helps though.    For Zumanity tickets I'm sure you could find discounted tickets, but worse case scenario you don't and you can just buy them when you're in Vegas. It's not like it will sell out.

Are there likely to be tickets available through tix4tonight or should I go ahead and spring for full price?    This is a holiday weekend, if you prefer being able to choose your seating, I would spring for the full price. We had comp tixs one night and it was under the edge  balcony and had limited view of what was going on above us."

They are generally pretty lax about checking room keys.    The smaller pool at GVR (I forget what it's called these days) is pretty nice.  It's definitely got some thumping music but it's not the Marquee/Wet Republic type of atmosphere.  It's very small, however, so if you're looking for any kind of people watching then your options will be very limited.    The main pool at M is pretty quiet and relaxed too.  It's big enough that you can relocate away from anyone who is rowdy or from kids or whatever.  Also, they have their own party section so most of the riffraff will be over there (don't judge, it's a lot of fun)."

On that note, stay away from major DJS at the clubs cause it attracts a ""less open"" crowd.

vegas,36rqwt,vswinehart,3,Thu May 21 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"i think it depends on what kind of accounting work you want to do, and what type of industry you want to work in.  obviously gaming is going to be primary and will likely pay more.  You said that you are interested in private, but Deloitte, PwC, EY all have strong practices here.

vegas,36rqwt,doesitmakenoise,3,Fri May 22 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I used to work in finance for a major casino group & properties. I didn't really enjoy corporate life so please understand that my comment is biased since it wasn't for me. That said - feel free to ask me further questions.  Your CPA will get you a higher salary if you go for a casino. Try to start as a manager, I doubt you could get a director position. I've seen people with CPAs be more in the senior accounting level (step under manager).  Casinos pay like shit - simple fact - BUT they have a lot of stability, lots of upward / sideways mobility, and if you have a family the benefits are great. You'll also learn a lot. I believe the pay for a senior accountant is around $50k, $70 or $80k for manager.  The best place you could absolutely go start is in a smaller group that supplements casinos. Things like Shufflemaster that do technology rather than actual casino will start you off above a casino would... probably significantly.  There are other industries out here like healthcare and recently 'tech' has grown. Tech will potentially be harder to find something and the pay won't likely be better than a casino but your lifestyle will be wayyyy better. For tech look up Vegas Tech and startups. The biggest group is Zappos. Zappos has some really new management style (holocracy) and ~20% of their employees just left. We also have a lot of legal group here. I know nothing but them though.  Casinos is the most obvious route and I may suggest it to at least get started out here. There will be the most potential jobs at them. The lifestyle is just rather ridiculous - very corporate. You will only do half the things you mentioned but it'll cover the full range of casino departments."

Plan B is to look for another small public firm that deals with small companies and individual clients but if all else fails, I'm gonna try for corporate.  One of the job descriptions I was looking at was for Zappos and I think I would rather work for a company like that than the casinos.

vegas,36rfkl,notmyrealnam3,2,Thu May 21 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"well keep in mind that any of the night clubs will be super packed and wild. The clubs with the big name djs (Hakkasan, Marquee, XS, Omnia) will play house - but most of these clubs will have a separate room that will play top 40/ hip hop. Other smaller clubs / lounges (my preference) like The Bank, TAO, LAVO, Hyde will play top 40 with a mix of dance and house. For you it will be perfect, but for your mom not so sure, I mean it will be really wild and to get a place to sit is pretty much impossible if you don't have a table - and they don't sell food after a certain hour.  I would suggest bottle service at LAVO or Hyde though - smaller more lounge type places that still have that nightclub feel and you'll have a table too for seats to relax (for your mom). So as you said, you can sit and talk, well more like yell in their ear lol, and then go to the dance floor and party, and MOST important you won't have to wait 30 minutes for a drink"

vegas,36rfkl,MatticusXII,2,Thu May 21 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"it is just like any bar. you can pay cash for that round that you're buying or you can open up a tab with the bartender, in which all drinks that you order will go on your tab and when you leave you will close out your tab with the bartender and he will charge your card at that time"
vegas,36rs6a,antitonal,2,Thu May 21 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"Why are you worried that it'll be ""painfully loud?"" Most band rooms are tile; the sound is fine and clean up is much easier.   Remember that the room will be filled with kids, chairs, and equipment (lockers, etc), so it won't have the same echo you might have noticed if you went into the space when it was empty."
vegas,36rs6a,exceptyourewrong,1 point,Thu May 21 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"The choir rooms in town are the tiled rooms and some orchestra.  Our buildings are carpeted for the band rooms, tile is the exception.  You're right it doesn't have the same echo but is still a huge echo as the ambient surfaces are still hard (lockers are still flat hard surfaces).  Additionally there is a safety issue of a slippery floor from water keys, dented shanks and bells from dropped instruments (greater than tile), never mind the more difficult listening environment for the players and teacher.  The louder ambient sound, the louder students are (whispering about the music vs talking about the music).    Also depending on the carpeting it can help with the wiring of additional sound support as the classroom PA is great for regular classrooms but not sufficient for music classes (not high enough sound quality at medium volume and distorts quickly at medium high and high).  But that is a whole other issue that I'm working on.  Sorry for typos."

vegas,36pcjg,Photojared,2,Thu May 21 02:37:13 2015 UTC,There is a lender I work with that is great. Always gets everything taken care of and on time. Shoot me a pm if you want her info.
vegas,36pcjg,Photojared,2,Thu May 21 03:29:24 2015 UTC,"As a real estate agent, what do you need to know?    Usually you want to speak directly to a lender.  Most lenders will be able to answer your questions."
vegas,36pcjg,Photojared,1 point,Thu May 21 03:44:34 2015 UTC,I don't want to rent anymore. And I understand (whether correctly or not) that buying is cheaper. I pretty much just want to know whether I could qualify and how to go about buying my first house.
vegas,36pcjg,mferg02,2,Thu May 21 04:11:34 2015 UTC,Ahh. A real estate agent should be able to answer those questions.  Buying is not necessarily 'cheaper'.  Down payments and mortgages can be higher.   Also looking into the Nevada Home is Possible program.

vegas,36oze7,Lickor13,2,Thu May 21 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"From my experience- it's awesome. The food is just absolutely delicious. Nice environment, definitely has an old Vegas feel. Prices aren't terrible, especially considering some of the other steakhouses on the strip."

vegas,36p5gz,mermaids_singing,3,Thu May 21 00:42:52 2015 UTC,The weekend of June 19th is EDC Weekend. Prices are going to be high from Thursday to Monday. It's also going be packed with drunk ass partiers.  http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/
vegas,36p5gz,cire1184,1 point,Thu May 21 04:42:57 2015 UTC,1) My first thought is: I'm too old for this shit  2) My second thought is: who needs gambling when I have all that prime people watching?  3) My third thought is: isn't that every summer weekend in Vegas?  Thanks for the warning!
vegas,36p5gz,cire1184,3,Thu May 21 04:50:15 2015 UTC,1 You might be too old for this shit  2 People watching is for after you lose it all  3 It will be your typical summer weekend in Vegas x3. Maybe not as crazy as the Mayweather Pacquiao fight but probably crazier then your typical 120 degree weekend in July. Probably a notch above Memorial Day Weekend or Labor Day Weekend.  4 I'll be there that weekend. :)  If you don't mind the crowd there will be some good people watching. Lot's of people wandering around in costumes that won't ask you for a tip for taking a picture with them. Girls in slutty clothes that won't be trying to take you to the champagne room. A lot of fluffy calf high thingies.
vegas,36p5gz,cire1184,1 point,Thu May 21 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"Those are super cute, weird furry calf things.  I now absolutely know that I'm too old for this shit because all I think when I see them is ""How the fuck are girls wearing that in 120 degree heat???""  I'm a girl so I;ve never fallen for that champagne room nonsense, but who doesn't like looking at pretty girls?  Ehh, Vegas is made for crowds and the hotel rooms are as spendy as ones downtown where I live during tourist season.  We may bite the bullet and go.  Could make for some great stories, right?"
vegas,36p5gz,devon223,2,Fri May 22 00:26:19 2015 UTC,Sure. You might even find some cheap edc tickets on Sunday and take in the spectacle
vegas,36p5gz,jinsanity811,1 point,Fri May 22 00:32:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, sweetie.  I am most definitely too old for that shit!  Have fun!"
vegas,36p5gz,chedderchez,3,Fri May 22 01:48:18 2015 UTC,Do not go that weekend unless you want to be surrounded by strung out ravers all day and pay way too much for rooms. EDC is one of the most expensive weekends of the year.
vegas,36p5gz,jrshaul,3,Thu May 21 04:50:35 2015 UTC,the d hotel and the downtown grand are awesome downtown spots. the linq is re-done and looks awesome
vegas,36p5gz,pandaposse,3,Thu May 21 10:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's very telling that, after all these responses, nobody has mentioned the new SLS. That place must be failing miserably. Not even Rock in Rio across the street could save them. They had a 40% off rooms promo valid for the days of Rock in Rio."
vegas,36ov5c,mferg02,5,Wed May 20 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"Here's a very helpful self-help guide for you. Since security deposit is a typical small claims action, you really don't need an attorney (unless you have an abnormally large security deposit).    Painting the whole house is pretty unreasonable. Write a demand letter before taking your landlord to court. Offer the cost of the holes, but refuse to paint the whole damn house unless you've ruined it. Be reasonable, be courteous. Use small claims if you get stiffed."
vegas,36ov5c,doggyfur,1 point,Wed May 20 23:46:40 2015 UTC,by demand letter you mean a letter basically stating what we agree to fix?
vegas,36ov5c,doggyfur,1 point,Thu May 21 00:14:47 2015 UTC,Kind of. Here's what I mean.
vegas,36ov5c,MsKim,2,Thu May 21 00:46:29 2015 UTC,Painting and new carpet is usually the responsibility of the owner if there has only been reasonable wear and tear.  I dont even think you are responsible for cleaning the carpets.
vegas,36ov5c,Sirtriplenipple,2,Thu May 21 00:06:10 2015 UTC,Cleaning the carpets is written into the lease at some places unfortunately.  Just had to do this too...
vegas,36ov5c,GPGrieco,2,Thu May 21 00:51:07 2015 UTC,You should not need to paint the whole house unless you damaged it. Light bulbs are usually the tenants responsibility. Blinds and toilet paper holders that are broke would also be your responsibility if it broke while you were there. Anything else they are asking for?
vegas,36ov5c,GPGrieco,1 point,Thu May 21 03:28:24 2015 UTC,the things that were broke is understandable...I just was contesting having to paint the whole house.
vegas,36ov5c,GPGrieco,1 point,Thu May 21 20:12:28 2015 UTC,Do you have any pictures of the place when you moved in? This would show the condition. If not you may want to do that in the future. Take tons of pictures of absolutely everything before you move in. Then if anything like this happens you can prove what it looked like before.
vegas,36ov5c,Photojared,1 point,Thu May 21 20:19:08 2015 UTC,we actually do have pictures of dirty walls when we moved in and even listed it on the lease agreement
vegas,36ov5c,Photojared,1 point,Thu May 21 20:28:37 2015 UTC,Then present that to them. You shouldn't need to paint anything if that is how you got it.

vegas,36oilt,Jassanova,3,Thu May 21 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"Promoters usually have a little more sway when it comes to where you are located, getting you in for ""hosted entry"", waiving cover if you tip enough, etc.  Some promoters have more power than others, so you ideally want to hook up with a senior host if possible.  Calvin Harris at Wet Republic is expensive but worth it if you guys have the budget.  A day bed is usually 2k min.    If it's not against the rules I can PM you some names of people who can hopefully help you out at Wet, and other clubs if needed."

In regards to just casino bars, you can apply online on the casino websites  mgmresortscareers.com has a bunch of cocktail waitress and bartending jobs.  The key is to know if the bar/club/lounge is owned or leased. If its leased you would have a good shot at going and asking to speak to a manager about any openings. If its owned by the casino they will most likely just direct you to their website.....however, meeting the manager in person could help get your application pushed through."

vegas,36iqti,semanticantics,2,Tue May 19 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"http://plentyofplaces.com/nevada-properties/  I was specifically thinking of Park Avenue Apartments downtown & google led me to this - I assume it's their property management company. Also shows listings for their nearby properties. Keep in mind, downtown is still up-and-coming so some areas remain seedy. Get renters insurance.  Edit to add that most of the areas surrounding the Strip, not just downtown/Fremont Street, have not been the safest. Since you're without a car, however, downtown could have the advantage because the Bonneville Transit Center for the local buses is close by and can take you to anywhere in the valley."

You can get some things at Walgreen or The Market but your options are limited and more expensive. You can take the bus but can expect any trip to the grocery store will take an hour and a half and you're limited to how much you can carry and won't melt!  Other than that, I recommend Downtown!

Expect things to take 5x as long using the bus than with a car. Also you have to think of the heat. Once it hit's the 100+ degree mark you don't want to be walking too far!  The $500-$650 range, although not impossible, won't won't get you much, especially close to the strip. Start getting a few mile away and you may have better luck, especially if you bump up your budget to $700-$800 per month.  As for the eviction, that may give you problems. The couple places I've rented here in Vegas did background and credit checks.  I'd recommend searching all your options and then start calling!

The going rate for super-stretch limos and above starts at about $80 an hour, not including gratuity and fuel fees.   Also, limos don't work like cabs. You unfortunately have to reserve them since they are considered a luxury vehicle.  I'd say cab it, if you had to choose, if you don't have to go very far, and then you can split the cost of the cab 4 ways.   I'm not sure what your itinerary is, but why not just walk to where you want to go and then cab it back when you're tired? Caesars is basically right in the middle of the Strip anyway, and depending on the night you're here, you can probably get to and from your destination faster."

If you get a good driver ask for a card or phone number and you can try to call them when you need a ride next time.

vegas,36efnh,d3wayne,1 point,Tue May 19 00:18:16 2015 UTC,I am still learning photography but I think there are 3 things contributing to the blur.  1) It is probably not 100% focused properly.  2) Vibration due to wind and slow shutter speed (next time I'll be sure to increase the speed to reduce camera motion blur)  3) I still don't know how to properly use my camera in such a way that I can get the kind of super crisp landscapes I think we are all used to seeing.

vegas,36gtnk,midgeporn,3,Wed May 20 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly curious what you pay. Not because I want to work for you, but more just I don't know how you compete/recruit people who live in Vegas to come work there.  There are so many negatives to driving to Primm; 90 miles round trip in wear on my car, gas expense, and finally just in time cost of driving for that long. Who are you finding that will take this job while living in Vegas? The pay would have to be pretty good..."
vegas,36gtnk,jrshaul,3,Wed May 20 05:43:20 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb, fuel is less than half the cost of a car (and that's assuming you're driving something ancient and reliable.) 90 round trip in a ~30mpg Civic is going to cost you ten in gas, so you're looking at twenty dollars per day in actual travel expense. So, assuming full time employment, $10.50 an hour is no more than $8 in town.   You wouldn't be posting here if you were offering more than $12 an hour, so I'm guessing the pay does not justify the commute. And that's before we figure in the hour and a half a day you lose to sitting on the freeway..."

When you see her, she spends as much time with you as you need. She always makes sure that you have gone over everything you need and never rushes you. She's an Internist but she does everything a General Practitioner would do. I honestly cannot praise her enough.  Here are the cons: the drive really is extremely far. It takes me a good 35-45 minutes to get there (I live about 10 minutes away from Town Square. Sometimes it can be hard to get an appointment.

vegas,36e0uj,wmass,2,Mon May 18 17:50:19 2015 UTC,This is good advice considering OP doesn't have a lot of time.  Grand Canyon is amazing but it's a long round trip for one day. The drive to Zion is really nice if you haven't seen much of the Southwest. There is lots of great scenery to see by car. There are some decent restaurants right by the park gate.
vegas,36e0uj,PBRBeer,1 point,Mon May 18 19:50:14 2015 UTC,Holy shit! I would have never known about Zion (although I have seen photos) if you hadn't mentioned it. I think we'll do that instead - much shorter drive! Thanks for the info.
vegas,36e0uj,karibear909,2,Mon May 18 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would second this, Zion you can get much more up close and personal with the landscape, the road through the park is absolutely amazing, the tunnel, the switch backs, it's absolutely beautiful, there are also some great short hikes to do there as well."
vegas,36e0uj,karibear909,2,Mon May 18 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"No problem, Zion is easy to make a day trip out of too. You can easily do a couple hikes as well, weeping rock is short and the temple of sinawava trail (Riverside walk) are a couple good ones that are pretty easy. But I would definitely choose Zion over the Grand Canyon in my opinion. If you're going on a Saturday though, try and get there early and you'll want to park outside the park and take the shuttle in and then get on the tram."

Yardbird at the Venetian is one of my favorites on the strip. Definitely worth a visit if you like good hand crafted cocktails and great southern food with an upscale twist. Highly recommend. For the most part though, the top restaurants on Yelp are a safe bet. If you're looking for cheaper places off the strip, there's plenty of ""hidden gems"". Carlito's, Off The Strip (yes that's the name of the restaurant), Due Forni, there's a lot of good places on Fremont East or in the arts district on Charleston Blvd.   The bigger name casinos are obviously the nicer ones; Wynn, Cosmo, Aria, Venetian/Palazzo, Mandalay Bay. If you are looking for cheaper tables games, you'll need to get off the main strip.   Clubs, can't really help you there. I try to stay away.   Theme parks, no. We have Wet 'n' Wild but it's pretty small and can be packed. NY NY has a roller coaster and the Stratosphere has some rides at the top. The Linq has the big observation wheel.   For pictures, head towards Summerlin (west side of town) and Red Rock. You can get some amazing views of the city from that side of town and it's super nice out that way. Red Rock is absolutely beautiful.   I hope this is a good starting point. If you have any more specific questions feel free to pm me. There really is a shit ton to do here and something for everyone.

vegas,366idr,JohnLeePettimore,1 point,Sat May 16 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"Man, I just built one very similar with the same idea also here in Vegas. Because the table tops were so damn expensive for the size I wanted (8'x30""), I ended up making the table top myself with 2x6's. Just glued, sanded, stained, sealed and it was done. (Easier said than done, I know, but saved me a bunch).  For the pipes, I went to Lowe's. I made a list of all the sizes and connections I needed and took it to them. I had to buy anything under 2 feet as is, but everything bigger than that they cut and thread for free. So I only needed two 10 foot pipes cut into about six pieces, then I cleaned them and spray painted them.  I am pretty happy with it and it definitely saved money. But it also certainly took way longer than it would have to just buy a table top. I'll post pictures once I get a chance."

I agree feel like all they did was highlight the strip and drinking. How about you show folks that there's more to Vegas than what they see on TV? Jeeze.

I was told that the beer was not able to be comped, and then the bartender listed off what was.  That's probably the experience you'll have if you ask for something a little less ordinary."

The first couple times I ate there I actually said I would never eat there again. My last experience was better, but being from L.A. it's hard to impress me with Mexican food. Fausto's is pretty good though, and the Henderson location isn't far from me. Good prices and good food."

The amazing about Fausto's besides the food is that they don't ever mess up my order ever. I have been going there (2 different locations) since 2006 and make substitutions to my order every single time and they have never messed up. This includes when they are super busy which the horizon and college location almost always is. They are also super fast at preparing the food."

Yes, they sell food out of their house and it is the best I've ever had. I used to think Tacos El Gordo couldn't get any better until a friend of mine took me to this house.  I highly recommend the Mulas and I'll leave it up to you on what meat to put on them. You have the normal asada and al pastor, but if you are a fan of Tripas this place is where it's at. Another good topping is the suadero, which I was not impressed by at Tacos el Gordo but this place is on point! Last time I was there about a month ago I grabbed one of their business cards and now he is doing taquizas at parties or gatherings.  I can't find it at the moment but will post it up here when I do. The exact address is 3901 Nixson drive and they only serve food on the weekends.  I recommend getting there about 8 ish, 11 ish they start running out of food. Everyone that I have taken there agrees this is the best slice of real Mexican food they've had.  It took me back to my days in Juarez eating at the food carts.  Let me know how it goes if you go.

They have a drive-thru window, but they honestly don't make their food fast enough to warrant one. I recommend just going in and ordering. The building is so brightly decorated that you won't even realize there is a door you can go into. It's sort of camouflaged.

Coming from L.A., this is the most authentic Mexican food that I have been able to find in the valley (sit down, not take out).   I used to like going to Chapala's on Trop/Pecos, however their quality seemed to slide (their weekend brunch is crap) and then there was the whole Health Dept Shutdown thing, which caused me to never want to return. Tacos and Beer is pretty good (especially with the Groupon deals),  Roberto's was ok...until I found a stainless steel nut at the bottom of my burrito (Russel/Bldr location) and nearly broke my tooth--That was the end of that.  Santa Rosa Taco Shop is decent (lake mead/Henderson) although the location is in a bit sketchy of an area...Don Tortaco on Horizon Ridge is also pretty good.

But seemed like would if they could  Man Bay did not work and no reason given.  The Quad was a horrible mistake start to finish, shouldn't have saved the $$. Did work and got me into a safeless, stained, horrid smelling ""upgraded"" suite that was just awful.  Will be back in June, never tried downtown, will try GN. but my room is free for 3 nights.  Extra story if you care: I still love Flamingo for value and location.  I was there recently and the check in line had to be easily 100 deep. I saw a ""manager"" looking person and asked him, as I looked at the line, if he thought they would have any upgrades, with the 20 clearly in my hand. He must have thought I looked nice or was bored and escorted me to the platinum/Gold/whatever check in lounge off to side.  It was glorious. I was taken care of, no line, upgraded, no $20 required, they refused it.  THEN I realized how did I not tip this manager guy of all people in vegas!  Took me about 20 minutes but I hunted him down and gave him the 20.  I thought that was really special.  Made my GF feel really nice.    So I'll stay at Flamingo or at least split my trips everytime I go back"
vegas,35z00m,rdrean,2,Thu May 14 18:56:44 2015 UTC,I've done this to skip check in lines too. Usually the valet can get you into the VIP check-in lounge so you don't have to hunt down a manager. But definitely tip the valet guy $20 for this service above any regular valet tipping.
vegas,35z00m,altimage,2,Thu May 14 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"cool...Im going to remember this.  We check in on Friday so I'm sure I will really enjoy avoiding a line.  Any decorum tips for valet?  Maybe walk up 20 in hand, ""Hey is it possible to get me into the VIP check in? I'm in a bit of a a hurry."" or some other tact?"
vegas,35z00m,rdrean,3,Fri May 15 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"Here's was the entirety of the transaction:  I did valet like normal. Walked in and saw a long line. Walked out to valet, with a $20 in my hand and found the guy who I valet'd with. Said ""There are a lot of people in the checkin line and i really don't want to wait. Can you help me out? I tip well"". I showed the $20. He said ""follow me"". He walked into the VIP checkin area. He went in first and talked to the lady there, then brought me in. We sat, she checked me in in about 5-10 minutes and we went to our room. We got our room from vegas.com and the checkin person said they don't normally process those type of reservations so it took her a bit of fumbling and asking someone else what to do since it had a couple of package extras, but she worked it out and we were up to our room with everything we needed in short order. I didn't tip the check in person. I believe that the valet often split their tips with the other hotel staff that helps them. So definitely don't under tip. $20 is usually appropriate for anything like that in Vegas."

vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,3,Thu May 14 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"I almost always book the lowest possible level avail.  So two queens, smallest room.  I am usually upgraded to higher floor, better side of hotel.    One time up to a ""suite"" but that was the quad and it was awful.   And the flamingo upgraded me to higher floor, pool view one time but kicker was it was when they were in process of renovating rooms so it was one of the first ones to be completed.  Real nice compared to my friends room in the other tower."

Depending on how many days you'll be there of course.  Fremont experience is worth seeing at least once. Cheaper stakes, a bit more laid back vibe. But be aware if you like to keep it classy and upscale, there is a bit of a walmart element there.  If you have females they always love the pool area at Golden Nugget.

Feel free to pre-game, since drinks are very expensive inside the club, but make sure you're good enough to get inside first.   And just don't be a dick inside the club.

vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,9,Fri May 15 13:07:39 2015 UTC,"room reservations agent here  The reason why the $20 dollar trick didn't work if you tried it is because the suites probably all sold out! This is a big reason why I always recommend just booking the suite in advance if you want to guarantee it. I have a lot of people come through ""celebrating their bachelor party"" and get super upset when we do not have a suite at check in assuming the $20 trick will work, then their whole bachelor party is ""ruined"" because they didn't originally book the suite they wanted. The $20 trick is never 100% guaranteed.  Tipping in general here in Vegas will always get you something ""better"" or ""extra."" Give the Valet attendant $20 and your car will be sitting in front of the hotel for you, tip the Bouncer $20 and you will move to the front of the line, and tip the cocktail waitress really good in the casino and you'll get non-stop drinks."

I'm already really happy with the rooms we got, so while an upgrade would be fabulous but I wouldn't be upset if it didn't happen.   Do you suggest asking for a complimentary upgrade or just slipping a 20$? Also, do you get annoyed when customers ask for an upgrade? I don't want to make someone mad and over step my boundaries."

I almost want to reply ""Do you want us to sing you Happy Birthday?"" haha.  Comp upgrades can happen, but I would recommend the $20 first as you'll have a better chance. At least, the agent should at least comp your resort fees, which is much greater than $20. It greatly depends on how lenient the resort is and what agent you get though.   I've upgraded people into suites just because they were genuinely nice."

They see the 20, they know the drill.  Like others have said there is no drama.  They will either hand it back and say sorry, no.  OR keep it  and upgrade you in some way.  The thing to remember is the upgrade might be ""technically"" an upgrade but you might not even have known the difference.   BUT again, like others have said, its 20 bucks to maybe get something.  You can't do that at the best western in Boise."
vegas,35z00m,fahque650,2,Fri May 15 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I've always wanted to ask about this!   Should we be specific about upgrade? Like I'm going to Flamingo soon, I have a 2xQueens GO luxury booked, is it too presumptuous to ask for a Metro or Forever Fab suite? The other rooms likely won't work (like GO Mini suite since it doesn't have 2 beds). Does our gambling status matter at all (I'm basically a 0, or Gold Member in TR which is basically nothing) Is there a good way to even ask? Does asking a certain way help?"
vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,3,Thu May 14 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"I would be specific about the room. I'm not too familiar with the suites at the Flamingo, so I'm not sure how much of an upgrade that specific room type is but it's doesn't hurt to ask! The best way to ask is just casually. Be nice. It sucks because front desk agents get the worst from people. People spit at them, shout in their face, throw things at them. It's a pretty stressful job at times and the turnover is high because sometimes some things don't meet people's expectations of what their rooms should be. I would hand over the tip casually and I would say something like, hey I really liked the X suite and I was wondering if you had any available.  Now I deal with casino/VIP bookings mainly, so with your players card the most you will get is maybe access to the VIP check-in at the main front desk and maybe a couple of other extras depending on the hotel. At the resort I work at, the front desk can't see how much you've played. Only the ""exclusive VIP"" check in can which is usually in its own separate room. Everything is usually pre-arranged for casino players with their casino hosts."

vegas,35z00m,thatcaveman,1 point,Fri May 15 17:08:46 2015 UTC,You can combine TR accounts and usually get a much favorable rate with two players cards.  When I look online at TR.com I'm usually quoted anywhere from 120-50 bucks a night at mid-level properties on the weekends. When I add my SO's TR number we usually have a comp offer from at least one property.
vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,2,Fri May 15 02:50:06 2015 UTC,in any situation would the person at the desk keep the $20 and give nothing ??!!! im hoping there's a code that desk people follow to return it if they can't upgrade but i don't have the greatest faith in people so i never know.
vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,4,Thu May 14 23:36:30 2015 UTC,http://www.thetwentydollartrick.com/  Just try it. The worst they can do is say no.
vegas,35z00m,fahque650,2,Thu May 14 18:26:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. The worst that happens is they take your $20 and you don't get an upgrade. I have never had that happen at any vegas hotel.

If I don't at very least get the room I booked, then a manager will be involved.  Last time I tried I was politely told that they didn't have any available, which totally makes sense according to the Room Reservation Agent (/u/thatcaveman) posting elsewhere here that it can happen, and the agent just handed me the $20 back. Now, if an agent busts their hump and searches and searches, tries to pull some magic behind the counter, etc I definitely would not try to take it back.

I'm saying if I hand it over, and they don't even so much as blink and don't even check availability, I'd politely mention I accidentally had a $20 in the wad of cards I handed over.  It's a rare scenario: I've tried the $20 trick probably 5 or 6 times, and either gotten an upgrade or had them hand me back the money. I've never encountered them doing NOTHING. Even if the upgrade is a garbage upgrade like a few floors higher or closer to the elevator or something, that's fine."

We are talking double-doors with a hallway and his/hers bathrooms. Just out of curiosity I went onto the Caesars website and the same room-type was going for $1500/night. A couple of shitty pics (this was in 2009.)  There is, however, one more aspect to the $20 trick that I have added that has increased my success with the method exponentially. I'm not going to post it on public forum (because then everyone would do it, and the value diminishes), but if you message me I'll let you in on the secret. Gotten upgrades at Caesars, Mandalay, MGM, Ballys, TI, Harrahs, Flamingo, Rio, Bellagio."
vegas,35z00m,SurlyQueue,3,Thu May 14 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"Never tried it as CP.  Has worked several times at Cosmo.  Only once (at Golden Nugget) has the person seemed surprised to find the $20.  The rest of the time, they either thank me and set it aside, or pocket it before anyone sees.  In any case, I've gotten good upgrades each time."
vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,2,Thu May 14 19:43:33 2015 UTC,This is going to be a dumb question... but what exactly do you say when you hand them the 20$ haha
vegas,35z00m,fahque650,5,Thu May 14 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  Fold it so that the ""20"" is facing out on both sides and sandwich between your id and your credit card.  Hand them the sandwich.  If they say something, respond however you like.  However, if they palm it and slide it in their pocket, act like it never happened.  Either way, as they are checking in, make small talk.  Complement the property, either previous experiences or things you've heard.  Tell them how excited you are to stay with them.  Maybe mention a restaurant or show you are looking forward to.  Complimenting the property is complimenting them.  They will feel proud and will want to do you right.  If you're celebrating or have any other positive reason why an upgrade would make your trip even better, slip that in too.  ""This is her first time in Vegas and we're really wanting to show it off."" Make them want to upgrade you.  Finally: make sure you ask for, or at least mention, an upgrade.  If there's a particular room you are interested in, ask if any are available.  Be prepared: even with the $20, you may have to pay for the upgrade, especially if it is a big jump from the room you booked.  However, I've paid $30/nt for a room that was $200/nt more when I booked it.  This is still a win in my book.  If they can't do anything, deal with it.  You're tipping for the effort, not the upgrade.  I know some people will ask for the tip back, but I think this is very classless."
vegas,35z00m,LinuxNoob,1 point,Thu May 14 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll be sure to mention its my bachelorette party and give it a try thank you for the tips!!   Last question, if they give you an upgrade that ISN'T free of charge or a big difference in the final price they'll most likely tell you right? I'm imagining a scenario where I get this awesome upgrade and see an extra $2,000.00 on my card lol"
vegas,35z00m,peeinmyblackeyes,3,Thu May 14 20:35:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother mentioning your bachelor party. I hate to be honest with you but I get this about 100 times a day with sweet talking/21st birthdays. It's a bit numb to everyone who works in the industry here in Vegas. Money talks unfortunately.
vegas,35z00m,lvcablines,2,Thu May 14 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"What if I gave an insane event reason?  ""We're celebrating my astronaut anniversary. It's been 1 year since I went interstellar."""
vegas,35z00m,DisasterBUSE,1 point,Thu May 14 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"They will absolutely have to tell you if they offer you an upgrade and the room costs more per night. If they don't say anything, then the upgrade is ""complimentary"". Depending on where you stay, and the type of upgrade, I'd recommend anywhere from $20 to $100. At a place like Caesars Palace, a $20 would be good, a $50 would be the best. But for a $50 I would be expecting a decent upgrade, more than a high floor or better view.  At a place like Comso, a $100 tip can usually get you some pretty nice upgrades, albeit at a discounted rate. Again it's all relative on what they have available, but I've got upgraded to a bungaglo (which would have been $1000 more a night) for only $300 more a night.   If you go the $50 route, I'd recommend looking at the suite types they have available on their website and find a specific type that you want, and ask if they have that one available. You can also compare what the going rate is online, and compare that to what they offer it to you for (if it's not complimentary) and decide if it's a good deal or not. Hope this helps."
vegas,35z00m,DisasterBUSE,-2,Thu May 14 22:49:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think it's classless for them to just pocket it especially if you hand them the sandwich and they tell you there are no upgrades available. What kind of service is that? Why should that be tipped?  From the start the interaction is a proposition. If I went up to check in as normal and the agent upgraded me without me asking or doing anything (no sandwich) then it's different; I'd hand them $20 for going above and beyond.  Let's not sugar coat the situation, when you hand over a $20 before any interaction has taken place, it's a bribe. It's not like when you go to a club and hand the bouncer a $20 to jump the line you're handing it to him for ""doing a superb job of keeping people out""."

vegas,35z00m,DisasterBUSE,1 point,Thu May 14 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Just curious: if you hand the bouncer a $20 and he doesn't jump you to the front of the line, do you ask for it back?"
vegas,35z00m,Badwolf2013,1 point,Fri May 15 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I haven't ever tried it at a club. I would bet there is less recourse from a bouncer at a club taking money than a front desk agent, should it go sideways. As in, the bouncer takes the money and that's that, you can't really complain to anyone. Also there are no cameras.  The managers at a casino would absolutely be nearby the check in agent, and cameras everywhere. If I ask for it back, I'm getting it back."
vegas,35z00m,kewidogg,1 point,Fri May 15 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"It's the difference between a tip and a purchase.  If you want to buy an upgrade, then give them the money after they have accommodated your request and quoted you a price.  If you tip before you know that they can absolutely give you what you want, then you have to accept that it's a risk and they may have nothing to offer.  You're paying for the effort.  Now, if they take the $20 and promptly hand you the key to the room you booked, then I guess you have reason to ask for it back.  But as long as they spend a few minutes trying to find something, that's all you're asking for."
vegas,35z00m,bennett-,0,Fri May 15 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I said elsewhere here that if they spend time looking then I wouldn't ask for it back.

vegas,35z00m,notmyrealnam3,3,Fri May 15 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"Do not listen to the advice below.  ALWAYS ask if the front desk person can check for a ""complimentary upgrade.""

Anyways, she was very nervous and skeptical but slipped the clerk $50.  She was upgraded from the Carson Tower to...  Can't remember but it was high up in tower with its own valet entrance.  Rush tower maybe?  cost her $8/night more after tip.    I wouldn't start with less than $50.  $100 MAX if it's very busy and upscale.  A nice room really makes the difference to recharge!"

I'm one of those fairly quiet but bubbly drunks, and generally I can hold myself together. I can still play pretty good basic strategy blackjack even drunk, and was playing there but never encountered this free bet variation.  Probably because I was so drunk, I could NOT for the life of me figure out when I could make the free bet. So, my strategy was to try to bet it every hand. The dealer explained it to me a couple times, and finally it became a big joke at the table and every hand, I'd sullenly look down at my hand, slowly look up at the dealer, the dealer would either nod or shake their head ""no"" if I could place it.

The El Cortez is where you will generally find the absolute lowest minimums.  The poker room at Binion's will have the cheapest SNGs and Tournaments.  Gold Nugget poker room spreads 2/4 limit.  If you don't like what you are seeing in the place you are at, walk 500 feet either next door or across the street (no automobile traffic to worry about) to the next casino, and see if it is any better.

vegas,35yo4t,camaro2ss,2,Thu May 14 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Craps is easy despite being complicated looking. The ""come-out"" roll, you want a 7 or 11. If those miss, that's okay. Just don't hit a 2/3/12. After the ""come-out"" roll, you want the number that the dice landed on. This number is not a 7 or 11 or a 2 or 3 or 12. Ironically, if you hit a 7 in this stage of the game, you lose. You hit the number the dice land on, you win. Note if a ""7 or 11 or a 2 or a 3 or 12"" is hit during Phase 1, the come-out roll is reset.   It's easy to understand once you see a game for about an hour or so. That shit above is probably mumbo-jumbo. For now, follow this advice:  1. NEVER BET ANYTHING EXCEPT PASS/DON'T PASS LINE. It is safe to back it up with odds (behind pass line, unlabeled, after the come out roll stage is completed). You'll see other gamblers bet on other shit, but honestly, the odds go downhill if you do. The simplest thing to do at a craps table has the least house edge. If this bores you, go play a complicated game like Poker.  For a $3 game, I recommend a bankroll of at least $60. This allows you twenty pass/don't pass bets - easily three to four hours of fun. You'd probably want to leave if you hit $100.  Now if you're looking to overcome that house edge, you'll need to practice. I'm going to say something that may sound like bullshit, but it might not be:  It may be possible to influence the dice given at the table, in such a way as to consistently beat the house edge.  If you practice before you go to the table on something like a pool table(preferred, only a craps table is better) or a felt board or something with two dice, and get it such that you hit 7s as rare as only 1/7 tries consistently (with 1000+ rolls), you may have already beat the house edge with ~90% confidence.   7s statistically come up on average 1/6 tries, so if you practice at home and make your craps pitches consistent, you may be able to turn a large profit with craps.  With my own trials, this is still debatable. I've broken even on about $2000 in/out with Craps over the course of seven months. The house edge is 1.4%, so it's not significant enough to declare ""hey, craps is beatable"". It's an interesting problem though, so if you're good at sports, maybe you can be consistent at this and beat it."
vegas,35yo4t,LazyDriver,3,Thu May 14 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"NEVER BET ANYTHING EXCEPT PASS/DON'T PASS LINE.    Disagree. I'd recommend betting on the 6 and 8 as well. Helps make the game much more exciting without giving up too much edge to the casino. House edge on the pass line is 1.41%. Edge on the 6 and 8 is 1.52%.   Other than place bets, I agree to stay away from all the sucker bets in the middle."
vegas,35yo4t,LazyDriver,1 point,Thu May 14 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah 6/8 are safe bets too. Bit more complicated so I didn't mention it, but yeah. I figured it'd be good beginner's advice - because if you think betting 6/8 with place bets is safe, then why wouldn't 4/10 or 5/9 be safe? Shittier odds is why, see http://wizardofodds.com/gambling/house-edge/ . Almost as bad as betting the field on a 2x table. (Of course, this is with truly random dice. If someone's hitting seven 10s in a roll, they're either ridiculously lucky or accidentally skillful or deliberately skillful. But that requires observation which is a more advanced and risky technique.)  I didn't mention it because there's the big 6 and big 8, which pay complete shit compared to the place 6 and place 8. Figure he'd probably want to play before we made his head explode lol."

NYNY base rooms are just tiny, gives you the real living in a closet NY feel I guess.  Monte Carlo is boring but does have a small wave pool.  Luxor was OK last time I stayed there, nothing to complain about. Inclinator is fun to ride once. The rooms in the pyramid are a little small because of the slope. Monorail to Mandalay Bay is convenient.  Mirage has the best theming in the casino/lobby area but rooms need a bit of love. Best location out of all the other hotels as it is in the middle of the strip."

I just did a quick search on google flights and from LA to Vegas, you can get a round trip flight for $122 leaving on May 29 and Flying back on June 1.  Hotels.com has monte carlo for $171 a night for the same dates.  Quick math puts you somewhere near $800 total for flight and hotel.    I would also check southwest vacation packages to see if there is a deal you like better. I have never stayed in the Monte Carlo but i've heard good things.

The better priced Sunday flights are all around 7am which seems a little rushed.. I don't want my Saturday cut short to make a flight so I decided to loosen up the purse strings a bit and shoot for a later flight.

vegas,35t9fv,fahque650,2,Wed May 13 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"They are essentially 2-star properties, when for a few bucks more you can upgrade to a 4-star.."
vegas,35t9fv,sob317,1 point,Wed May 13 18:50:07 2015 UTC,Any recommendations or other ones to avoid? Just looking for mid-range type places on the strip. Thanks.
vegas,35t9fv,fahque650,2,Wed May 13 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"My quick Trivago search came up with Strasosphere for $122/night and Excalibur for $172/night during the dates that OP is looking for.  For those price ranges, I would rather go for:  Linq (formerly Imperial Palace) at $130/night.  Harrah's at $156/night.  Ballys at $171/night.  Treasure Island at $182/night.  The properties, average room type, and location at those are going to be much better than the Castle or the Strat."

vegas,35t9fv,bigpoppa922,1 point,Thu May 14 13:14:40 2015 UTC,"Exaclibur is just so outdated and there are a ton of kids running around.   Stratosphere is out of the way.  You can take a bus everywhere you need, but like Fah said, you can get better for just a few more dollars  If you want to save a few bucks, I recommend the Flamingo.  It is right in the middle of the strip and the pool is pretty sweet."

vegas,35t9fv,bigpoppa922,1 point,Wed May 13 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"Rank of places I have stayed:   Mirage Planet Hollywood New York, New York Treasure Island Flamingo  Ballys Stratosphere Excalibur   It really depends on how long you are spending in your room.  The top 6 are pretty centrally located and you can walk pretty much anywhere.  There are trams that run to certain hotels on the west side of the strip, There is a monorail on the east side (for a cost), and the Duece bus stops at every casino on the strip and runs downtown.  (You should check out downtown for one night. Cheap drinks and always a band or a DJ at various locations)"
vegas,35t9fv,MsKim,2,Thu May 14 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"If you want the cheaper version...Megabus RT LA-Vegas, Hotels.com for the hotel (Orleans, for example, is usually really cheap and they have a free shuttle to the Strip), and get show tickets from the Tix4Tonite kiosk (half price tickets).  All of this for probably less than $400."
vegas,35t9fv,gitismatt,2,Wed May 13 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"you can definitely do better if you just spend a few extra minutes searching for prices yourself.  hell, coming from LA you could even drive - $50 for gas is a lot less than almost any airfare you'll find."
vegas,35t9fv,bigpoppa922,1 point,Wed May 13 17:44:00 2015 UTC,and you can park for free at the hotels
vegas,35t9fv,Stand17,1 point,Thu May 14 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"That's expensive.  Pretty much when I find a round trip flight for under $200, I strongly consider going to Vegas.  I leave Thursday and come back on the red eye Monday morning.  Way better to book directly with the hotel.  Do you gamble at all?  I get my rooms comped, and pay resort fee only (sometimes that gets waived too).  If I can't get a comp, I stay at a motel.  You may try ask player's desk if they can comp part of your stay before you checkout.  You're going to need a lot of action at strip properties.  Easier to get a comp downtown.  Hell, at some places you just need to bet $25 a hand at blackjack and a host will approach you.  A host will set you up with all the freebies."

vegas,35rr4n,Mattock79,2,Tue May 12 23:34:32 2015 UTC,I would try Red Spring Park just north of the actual Red Rock loop. It's trails are pretty mild in comparison and has some great views as well.
vegas,35rr4n,ni_eto,1 point,Tue May 12 23:50:22 2015 UTC,That's actually a really good idea I hadn't even considered. Thanks very much!
vegas,35rr4n,Photojared,2,Wed May 13 00:08:03 2015 UTC,La Madre Springs would be perfect
vegas,35rr4n,tedistkrieg,1 point,Wed May 13 01:39:07 2015 UTC,+1 for La Madre....however the trail continues after the spring to La madre cabin and cave but one doesn't need to go that far
vegas,35rr4n,MaybeHeartofGold,1 point,Wed May 13 03:21:11 2015 UTC,There's a dry creek trail that's not on the usual map. But it's near the back stretch.  It's about three miles and is perfectly flat. Only down side is there's no sun protection.  But it's also very wide for much ADD doggie goodness.
vegas,35rr4n,MsKim,1 point,Tue May 12 23:48:25 2015 UTC,I think Potato Knoll is pretty flat and easy. First Creek to the Grotto might require picking him up to get back on the trail from the grotto.

vegas,35s8p9,cah242,3,Wed May 13 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"Coming from California originally, I've noticed this too. My guess is that it's because Vegas/Henderson has a pretty high percentage of the population of the state of Nevada. That means you're more likely to run into vanity plates than if you're in a large city in another state"
vegas,35s8p9,drunksage,1 point,Wed May 13 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"this is exactly what I figured was the reason for them all as well...California is huge, so there are less vanity plates vs regular plates because people have used up a lot of the ones someone would want."
vegas,35s8p9,mferg02,3,Wed May 13 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"They are pretty cheap to get, but I didn't know that was even a thing here."

vegas,35s8p9,deademery,2,Wed May 13 02:58:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, was too hasty. EDIT: from your link, it's $42 to start, $20 renewal. Still cheaper than, say, California ($48/$38), but not dirt cheap.  https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/ipp2/initPers.do"

vegas,35s8p9,karibear909,3,Wed May 13 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"There was a state-by-state survey of vanity plates back in 2007. They said the national average was about 4% of eligible vehicles had vanity plates. #1 Virginia, #4 Nevada (13%).  Texas ranked last with under 1%. (the list)"

vegas,35s8p9,gitismatt,2,Wed May 13 11:42:33 2015 UTC,"i know people in VA and they said it's price.  I think there it is either the same price as a standard plate, or cheaper.  In other words, price isn't a deterrent to having people express themselves in seven characters"
vegas,35s8p9,duffmanhb,2,Wed May 13 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the alternative plates that throw me off. I just haven't been able to clue together what some of them are for. For instance, the one that has only 4-5 digits, and then a vertical 3-4 digits to the right of it, with an image of the strip in the background. I see it all the time, but have no clue with it's for."
vegas,35s8p9,gitismatt,3,Wed May 13 17:40:45 2015 UTC,if only there was a place where you could go to find out this kind of information
vegas,35s8p9,jurroot,2,Wed May 13 04:36:51 2015 UTC,My fil from ca also swears that there is an abnormal amount of vanity plates here.
vegas,35s8p9,Xkeeper,1 point,Wed May 13 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"I dunno about this. I've lived in Henderson the majority of my life (aside from 2 years in Washington) and even on trips/vacations, the amount of vanity plates I've seen here greatly exceeds the number I saw anywhere else. Just today I ran into at least 30 (and the De Lima hospital had a good 10-15 in the parking lot alone).  Everyone that visits/stays here also invariably comments on the sheer number of vanity plates as well."

vegas,35szfl,MatticusXII,1 point,Thu May 14 17:12:04 2015 UTC,Depending on what talent the venue has that night your total tax/grat will be either 34% or 41%. On top of whatever amount you end up spending  (in this case the floor is 2k). How many people in your group? Did you ask for a specific location?
vegas,35szfl,DisasterBUSE,0,Fri May 15 00:29:06 2015 UTC,"That's a question for the promoter. Usually it does not and you should tip separately but everything is dependent on the night.   From a pretty heavy drinker and someone who has done the whole vegas experience as both a tourist and a local, bottle service at that price is rarely worth it. If you are doing things right you are walking around and engaging women and not sitting at a table you will have more fun. Pre game before you go and dress the part, engage people and the party will follow you. Use that money to do one of the million other awesome things you can do in vegas and you will better enjoy your time.  If you have it to blow no worries, just don't expect it to you get you special treatment (especially if it's a group of all guys, you will most likely be sitting in a dead end area for that kinda price - depending on the day and club of course). Anyways good luck and enjoy your time !"
vegas,35szfl,TKGK,0,Wed May 13 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"ahh no i usually do get bottle service with my friends, but this is the first time i had to take care of the table duties.   its a marquee main table on memorial weekend saturday +1 free bottle. That should be a relatively good deal right?   i just feel like a noob having to ask my promoter about this haha.."
vegas,35szfl,chunk3ymonk3e,1 point,Wed May 13 07:30:33 2015 UTC,2000 minimum means you have to order at least 2000$ worth of alcohol and whatever they have and tip and tax is after so bill will usually be closer to 2200-2500$
vegas,35szfl,camaro2ss,0,Wed May 13 08:27:31 2015 UTC,"its a marquee main table on memorial weekend saturday +1 free bottle. That should be a relatively good deal right?   If that's the case, that's a really good deal. I'm guessing it's not one of the main tables on the floor, but one of the ones on the other side of the middle walkway, which is still a prime location. For $2k at Marquee on a holiday weekend I'd take that deal anytime."
vegas,35szfl,camaro2ss,0,Thu May 14 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"$2000 is the pre-tax minimum of just what you order - bottles, water, red bull, etc. Standard mixers are already included (OJ, cranberry, soda, etc).  The $2k min doesn't cover tax, gratuity, or tips to your server, busser, or promoter, so expect to pay about 30% on top of your 2k."
vegas,35r8ir,nickydoiron,5,Tue May 12 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt you will want to go to the Spa at Mandarin Oriental. It's the only Forbes 5 star rated spa in Las Vegas and the facility is very impressive, all two floors of it."

vegas,35r8ir,dj_advantage,1 point,Wed May 13 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"If you want the ultimate massage experience and there is no price limit, go for the deep tissue surrender for 80 mins at Qua spa in Caesars Palace. Or if you enjoy heat, the stone massage is blissful as well.    My advice with massages is to get as much time on the table as possible. This gives both you and the therapist enough time to have your body relax and enjoy the treatment. Each technique massage therapists uses can adapt to the stress areas of your body, the more time the therapist has to focus on relieving those stressed areas and help you relax."
