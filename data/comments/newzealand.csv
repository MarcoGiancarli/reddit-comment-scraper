And they're the ones buying all our milk solids (right?).  We got this. We'll absorb as much Chinese capital as possible into our housing stock until a cardboard box outside Real Groovy is worth more than a Italian hypercar, then - BOOM, we strike.   At 11.55pm on a Tuesday evening Prime Minister Colin Craig announces a nationwide freeze on the movement and trade of all capital, assets, goods and services. Trade of the dollar is suspended. All assets and businesses are immediately nationalised. Martian Law is declared and the bourgeois and intellectuals are pulled from their homes and sent to the camps. At lunchtime on Thursday the dollar resumes international trading and domestic commerce resumes with severe restriction. Physical currency is withdrawn and dollars may no longer be held or traded by citizens. All citizens are issued with biometric identification chips - implanted in forearm - that serve as a convenient and universal payment device from a weekly guaranteed supply of government credit.   The dollar plummets, but rebounds by evening on the news of the opening of both our first Nuclear power-plant and a series of armament factories. On Saturday evening at 7.25pm (ten minutes before the All Blacks square off against the All Robots) an impressive firework display segues into our first atmospheric nuclear weapon test. Reportedly, the efficiency of tritium tubing, no. 8 wire, and just a tiny pinch of coal dust produce a fearsome weapon that cowers Asia-Pacific, and indeed the entire world.  The flag is changed to a skull with crossed silver ferns under the jaw. The correct amount of TV channel (ONE) is restored. Mike Hosking is promoted to National Director of Patriotic Feeling and stalwartly broadcasts to the Great Nation for sixteen hours a day.  Everyone is happy and Godzone is once the again the bloody best little country in the bloody world."

Even if no ethnic Chinese from any country were allowed to immigrate here, this situation would still be happening.  Quite simply, if NZ real estate wasn't massively exploitable as an investment (by anyone, local or foreign), then nobody would worry about Chinese immigrants, because they wouldn't be willing to pay insane prices.  (Unlike non-resident investors who want to pay ridiculously high prices, because that moves larger amounts of their capital out of China).  Local investors are probably sweating over choosing the right time to sell their houses for maximum profit, because as soon as the Chinese government either halts capital movement out of China (which would be a neat trick), or their economy craps itself (much more likely), NZ house prices will drop as non-resident investors liquidate their assets to free up cash, and local investors start feeling the squeeze on their mortgages as the 'buyers-with-too-much-money' vanish."

I am against the heavy investment of foreign nationals but I think this one is even worse than labours data.

I don't know where I'll come up with $2500 for advanced rent, bond and letting fee AGAIN.   No doubt the property managers love this shit, since I'll have to pay a $500 letting fee just to have somewhere to live.  My partner and I had already decided to leave the country in the next 6 to 8 months, but now we'll have to move and pay a bunch of money again, and I'm stressed out by that, plus the fact that most property managers want you to sign a fixed term 12 month contract, which I just can't do if I want to leave.

There is absolutely no reason why the country's busiest stretch of road should be forced to go down to 30kph where the rest of motorway prior to and following the bridge is free flowing 80kph.  Either the truck is too heavy to reach the required speed and should be forced to go via SH16 where there are no such steep hills; or it is the laziness of the driver not being bothered to rev high enough to reach an appropriate speed. Neither are good enough arguments.

The first round is separating the wheat from the chaff, where you can vote to decide whether a flag is a serious or non-serious design. Maybe tinder-style with swipe left / right to decide.  Once all the serious designs have been distilled, you have another round of voting where you are given an upvote / downvote option.   The final voting round is for the top 20 flags which received the most votes in the previous round. This time you need to rate EVERY flag according to a scale (say, 1 to 10).

newzealand,3e07vo,MaxPowerNz,6,Mon Jul 20 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"There are some sounds in Maori that just aren't present in English. The rolled 'r' is one (phonetically closer to an English 'd'). Learning new phonemes as an adult can be a bit humiliating, and doing so while in a discussion with another person renders you temporarily unintelligible. I can understand people that want to avoid that.  If you can't understand the difficulty, try learning the Arabic 'q' sound, and use it any time you mention Qatar, or the Quran etc."
newzealand,3e07vo,PavementFuck,30,Tue Jul 21 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"I have two points to make regarding this:  Point A  I do try to say Maori words as correctly as possible, same way I try to say native words properly when I visit other countries. I think everyone should try to do the same, because frankly there are some ways that are just outright wrong. For example, imagine people saying Worcester like ""WOR-cester"", instead of ""Wuster"". It's just totally wrong to say ""WOR-cester"".  Exact same way you don't say Taupo like ""TAU-po"", it's ""TOE-paw"". ""TAU-po"" is just outright wrong and anyone still saying it that way needs to try harder.  All that said, there's a line to be drawn somewhere. I am just not going to put on some other accent just to ensure I say it 100% correctly. I'll try to say words according to the proper pronunciation, but modified by my own natural accent. That means I will say Taupo (TOE-paw) in my own accent, even if that means it comes out technically incorrect.   I do get the sense there's some expectation that people not fluent in Te Reo should still somehow say things ""properly"", even though it's extremely difficult to do so when you aren't a natural speaker of the language.   Non-speakers of Te Reo will have accents, and I think Maori who care about such things need to realise this. In other words, get the hell over it.  For a good example of a Maori word I refuse to pronounce correctly in normal conversation: ""Waikato"" said correctly has two stops (the K and the T) and the ""aw"" sound at the end of the word is clumsy and too hard to bleed into the next word.  So, I'm gonna keep saying Waikato as ""why-cuddo"", not ""why-cut-orrr"". Honestly if anyone has a problem with this, they can go jump in the lake. There's nothing wrong with having an accent. I don't hold it against Maori for speaking English with their own accent, so a little reciprocity would be nice.  Point B  Maori culture can be pretty intimidating regarding Te Reo and pronunciation. Sometimes it feels like you need to choose between getting ripped to pieces for saying stuff wrong, or getting laughed/sneered at for attempting to say it right.   So there's a certain element of not wanting to make a fool of oneself by saying it wrong, but also not wanting to make a fool of oneself by trying to say it right.   I think some people stick with the totally wrong pronunciations of Te Reo words thanks to insecurity (which is not necessarily misplaced). Blatantly saying things wrong is a bit of a shield in that respect. I think non-Maori would be a lot more open to saying things closer to the correct pronunciation if Te Reo speakers stopped acting like the language police and harshly judging people who get things wrong.  Now anecdotally, the last time I tried to speak Te Reo words correctly around some Maori people, I was later ripped into because I apparently said some tribal name incorrectly and it was taken as an insult. This was really intimidating. It made me not want to speak ANY Te Reo around ANY Maori. So I just don't, anymore. Fuck it.  In fact as a white person, Maori culture as a whole is actually really fucking intimidating, because of tikanga. It seems like there are a million potential faux pas, which may or may not be taken as deep insults.   It makes me not want to even engage at all, because I don't want to be judged or attacked for getting stuff wrong. There's this totally weird bipolarity across NZ cultures, because on one hand kiwi culture is laid back and there are no enshrined, formal protocols.   On the other hand there's Tikanga Maori, which is completely the opposite. As a whitey I am just not used to such adherence to formal protocol/etiquette, and sometimes it feels like Maori don't understand this when they treat my tikanga faux pas as insulting. It's just really hard to know everything about a culture you were not brought up in.  Hopefully nobody was insulted by any of that, but to be honest I don't really care much anymore either. I love Te Reo and think it should be taught compulsorily in primary schools, but at the same time if anyone is going to give me shit for saying stuff slightly wrong or screwing up some obscure tikanga, they can go jump in the lake. I've had repeated bad experiences with Maori when trying to be culturally sensitive, and these bad experiences have pushed me almost to the limit of my cultural sensitivity / ability to give a fuck."

It's just really hard to know everything about a culture you were not brought up in.    Anecdote for consideration - I remember waiting in line for a bus when what I presume to be a tourist family jumped the line and went straight to the driver. Everyone in that line felt personally slighted by this and we were in agreement with the driver as he ""forcefully"" tried to let them know they couldn't do that to their blank stares. I'm presuming these people had no idea what they had just done was a faux pas since they were not part of this culture but we still took offense at this even so and reacted with anger - The general NZ culture has ""Tikanga"", it's just that we were all raised in it and understand it. We frown on people spitting in the street, lines are sacrosanct, personal hygene is a must, keep the volume down, dont you dare tell us where our country is inferior compared to your own...these are all examples of informal protocol/etiquette that we don't codify but we feel must be obeyed. Because this ""tikanga"" is so obvious to us, the automatic presumption is that it must be deliberate when someone does the wrong thing and we react by becoming offended (either a deliberately chosen action or a deliberate choice to not learn our ways).   I hope that can give you a bit of insight about the responses you got to your Tikanga faux pas, though I will point out that people are people and although some of the negativity you recieved may be due to whanau being offended in the same way as I mentioned above - some of us are also intolerant asses and may have decided to just let rip on you for it as well, I'm not a mind reader :)"

French nasal vowels are much harder, German guttural consonants are almost impossible, English spelling can be indecipherable if you don't already know how a word is said. People manage all of these just fine. In contrast, Maori has a small set of phonemes that are mostly identical to phonemes extant in New Zealand English.

They say nearly every word wrong, but we still perfectly understand it, and we don't make a big deal over it.

newzealand,3e07vo,habetrot,6,Tue Jul 21 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"It takes effort to learn and to teach and to use the Maori pronunciation. IMO, it is useless for non-Maori to learn the pronunciations because we are outsiders to the culture, and our participation means nothing to it.    Maori is a real language, and an official language of our country.   I don't deny that Maori is a real language.   Just as we don't call Vienna 'Wien' because German does, neither should we change the pronunciation of Maori names in English spoken by non-Maori. In my opinion, encouraging non-Maori to use Maori pronunciations is putting it on a pedestal we don't put other languages on -- almost treating it like it's an inviolable dead ceremonial language or artificial register, not a living, changing, modern language suitable for everyday use."
newzealand,3e07vo,cape7,6,Tue Jul 21 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"It takes effort to learn and to teach and to use the Maori pronunciation.   It really takes very little effort to learn and teach Maori pronunciation though.   There are 5 vowel sounds:  a rhymes with car   e rhymes with meh  i rhymes with key  o rhymes with more  u rhymes with moo   If a macron is over a letter (like this > ā), you just hold that vowel sound a little longer. (So if the word Marvellous had a macron over the a, it would be pronounced Mahhvellous like John Campbell says it.)  Then there is Wh which is pronounced 'F' and Ng which is pronounced like the ng portion of 'singer'. 'R' is probably the trickiest but no one really minds if you pronounce it like a soft d sound.   Thats it pretty much. Its easy as can be, there are no other alternate pronunciations like wind/wind or the -ough bullshit we have in English. The whole language is made up of just those 5 vowel sounds and they are always the same, if you see a word you don't think you can pronounce, just remember the 5 vowel sounds and sound it out, i promise you its easier than it looks.   Honestly, you could teach basic Maori pronunciation to anyone in under 5 minutes. The challenge is that people can't be arsed, not that its at all difficult."

I speak Itailan and when I try to pronounce an Italian word when speaking English (e.g. when giving an etymology) I trip over my tongue.    The challenge is that people can't be arsed, not that its at all difficult.   It is much more difficult than you make it out to be.   I don't believe that the effects of non-Maori changing their pronunciation are even worth bothering; I doubt it would do anything at all."
newzealand,3e07vo,cape7,5,Tue Jul 21 06:55:31 2015 UTC,"The majority of those sounds are in English. I'll give you the 'r' and 'ng' sounds are awkward for English speakers, but all of the vowel sounds are present and easy, and they make up 80% of the Maori language. If people only made the effort to use the correct vowel sounds, that would be enough.   People using a language keeps it alive, and even even if just pronouncing place names properly is only a tokenistic gesture, at least its something. It goes a little way to validate the Maori culture and its place in New Zealand.  Its also just an attitude thing, why not just have a go? its not hard. I have a long Maori name, i tell people how to pronounce it correctly when i meet them. If someone has a genuine go but isn't pronouncing my name quite right, then thats all right, ka pai for effort. If i met you and you told me 'Nah, this is how you pronounce your name, its how we pronounce Maori in New Zealand' and proceeded to butcher it without even trying to use the right pronunciation, then you're an arsehole."

For instance, there isn't an English word for Tauranga, so why not pronounce it the way it's meant to be?  I don't refer to Christchurch as Otautahi, but I know how to say it.

Most kids just aren't learning any reasonable degree of the Maori language in primary school. It is a combination of many teachers having no idea how to speak it themselves (and not being willing to learn despite plenty of excellent and easy resources) and the national standards leaving little to no time for teaching that isn't maths or english. This also means people aren't being given a chance to become interested in the Maori language and culture at a younger age which probably has an effect. It is pretty awful

newzealand,3e07vo,ChopsNZ,5,Tue Jul 21 02:28:30 2015 UTC,And how much does the Maori Language Commission get each year to sit around and make up new words?   It is pretentious shit like this that stops languages from evolving. If you have to do everything perfectly then you are not getting an uptake of people engaged. It's also pretty fucking handy for keeping people out of systems they need to engage in. It is a form of elitism and pretty much every country in the world has regional dialects. Maori is no different. It varies a lot from region to region.  If you want it to be a living and viable language it needs to have flexibility.

Te Reo has been mainstream in schools since the 90's and as a result, pretty much everyone under 25 knows how and pronounces Maori words correctly. This mispronunciation is only really prevalent in older generations.  While Pakeha have been getting better and better at pronouncing Maori words generation by generation, Maori have become significantly worse at pronouncing english words, IMO. Don't get me started on the colloquial terms: ""Chur"" and ""Cuzzie"", I can handle... But for fuck's sake, my name isn't ""Bol"" or ""Dox"", it's Nick. If you have a question, ""ask"" me, don't ""ux"" me. On a side-note, why has every teenage maori kid started shouting ""sej fukn hayil"" (they can't even pronounce seig) or ""yofuk"" every other sentence?  If I'm being honest here, I find the typical lower-class-Maori accent absolutely disgusting.

Basically, this means that the govt. can't make laws which restrict corporations rights based on how much of their profit they send overseas.    A real world example of a similar case was how Australia was successfully sued for banning imports of New Zealand apples.    While yes, it would allow companies to bring frivolous lawsuits, they're going to lose those lawsuits, much like Phillip Morris lost it's first lawsuit against Australia when Australia bought in plain packaging laws and is expected to lose the remaining ones it's bought.    There is an argument that the very large companies will be able to strongarm the smaller countries who can't afford the legal defense, but while that's a good reason for those countries to oppose that section of the agreement it doesn't apply to us."

Once the western link tunnel is done and the northwestern is back online it should be ok for 5 mins.   If like to see more government investment in Tauranga and Hamilton and their connectivity, to attract larger business and take some heat off the growth of Auckland.   The farmers got screwed. Fonterra will still make bank because the global milk price they used to buy milk is good for their manufacturing. The economy is still too tied to primary industries.   Home lending rates are ok. Sensible people will use this time to pay down principle. WTF with exchange rates though.   Overall I feel like NZ is doing ok, but precariously on an edge.

newzealand,3e075j,knothead,8,Tue Jul 21 02:04:18 2015 UTC,I can agree there's always negatives to any government action and that the positives have to out weigh not just the obvious cost but also unintended consequences which can often be hard to judge.  That said my objection was to the way in which you phrased your comment which IMO shows a common libertarian belief that whenever the government does anything it's interfering causes more harm than good.  I was probably being picky but I really don't like that idea.
newzealand,3e075j,rifter5000,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"Libertarians like myself primarily object to the interference of government on moral rather than utilitarian grounds, but I think ultimately they're both aligned.  The government shouldn't force people to do things because it is an insult to human dignity to hold a gun to somebody's head, and they shouldn't force people to do things because ultimately people who are acting voluntarily rather than as a result of coercion are more productive."
newzealand,3e075j,knothead,7,Tue Jul 21 03:45:48 2015 UTC,"How do you expect to enforce property rights without putting a gun to somebody's head? Capitalism routinely forces people to follow other people's demands in order to meet their needs, which are not voluntary. Is coercion only bad or an insult to human dignity when it's the government?  I'm not trying to be hostile, I just don't think that unbridled capitalism represents the alternative to coercion that you're implying."
newzealand,3e075j,grittex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"I see your point - I don't think anarcho-capitalism would mean there is no violence in the world, just a different power dynamic. If I choose to defend my property by using weapons (horrible situation that I would hope humans could avoid for the most part) then I don't think that's the same as coercion. If someone is trying to harm/steal my property then they are the aggressor - I guess you could say I was ""coercing"" them to not steal my stuff, but if I didn't then they would be ""coercing"" me to hand it to them.  So getting rid of government does not end coercion, it just puts everyone on a level playing field, which I believe humans deserve."

So it's not coercion when you do it but it's coercion when I do it or I pay somebody else to do it.

I find that libertarians are the least moral people on this planet. Libertarians for example see nothing wrong with raising kids for their organs, or employment contracts that say the women must have sex with their supervisors on demand.    The government shouldn't force people to do things because it is an insult to human dignity to hold a gun to somebody's head, and they shouldn't force people to do things because ultimately people who are acting voluntarily rather than as a result of coercion are more productive.   No society anywhere in the world or at any time in the world has run without the rule of law which was enforced with a ""gun to the head"".  The fact that libertarians believe it's possible to run entire countries like this is what makes them amongst the most stupid people on this planet."

But I doubt the change from plastic to reusable would be as simple as producing the new bags and selling them for 300x the price. I don't actually know who provides retailers with the bags, but they will have deals selling in bulk to them. The ban will see that whole process change. Instead of regular bulk purchases the manufacturers are faced with an uncertain climate - are consumers still going to get these reusable bags from the retailers or are they going to shop around specifically for the bags? Are we going to have to find new buyers? Is there going to be increased competition with reusable bags? How frequently are the bags going to be replaced?   New situations require often massive process changes, and these are costly. This situation in particular would see an overhaul of the entire plastic bag manufacture industry, and I'm fairly certain they would rather avoid that."

Bags are priced at 15c, typically. It all sounds great, but it is a catestrophic policy.  60-80% of grocery shoppers buy thick reusable bags every time they shop. As the reusable bags contain 2-6 times the plastic of a disposable bag, there is a lot more plastic heading to landfill.  I totally agree with reusable bags, but actually mandating their use is difficult politically. You need to either ban the sale of disposable and short term reusable bags entirely, or you mandate a punitive price for purchasing reusable plastic bags. Half measures will result in more waste."

newzealand,3e3sw7,introvertdextrovert,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"Hola.   What's the weather like on summer/winter?   It's can be unpredictable.. e.g. it still rains in summer, but just not as much. In winter, if the weather's good (like today) then it's cold frosty nights, sunny days.. but can get a bit stormy at times.   What are some things I should know about Pay as you Earn system?   In most cases, your employer deducts the Pay as You Earn tax from your wages and pays it to the Inland Revenue Department for you.  It's 17.5% if you're earning between $14,001 and $48,000 a year.   Are you nice to foreign people?   In general yes - I've heard lots of positive comments from travelers about how nice Kiwis are in general - however there are some people who are not nice... a lot of it depends on how you behave too.  I find South Americans usually have a good time because all of the South American people I have met over here in NZ have been nice, friendly and very easy going.   Is new Zealand people shy or the opposite?   Some are, some aren't; it depends on where you go..  e.g. Kiwis can get a little rowdy in bars, but not as bad as the Aussies do.   Are hostels expensive?   They can be.     What are some good cities to start getting a job?   At certain times of the year there can be a lot of seasonal jobs available, e.g. right now is Kiwifruit season so there are quite a few jobs available picking and packing kiwifruit - but come August, that ends.  This website might be of some use to you: http://www.seasonalwork.co.nz/  I hope this is some help to you!!"
newzealand,3e3sw7,Muter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:43 2015 UTC,Public transport is probably better than pretending to use your bike to go to work.  They'll probably let you bring your pretend bike on board with you as-well.  Just be careful when you're riding it down the road in public places.  You might get a few strange looks as you pretend to ride it down queenstreet .. unless you wear some white face paint and black and white striped shirt and black pants.  If you do this people might give you money if you pretend well enough.

People can get together with similar aims and goals and choose what they want/need to learn while supporting each other in the growth of their education.  Sort of like open-source for education. Employers can give specifics, match it to a group and help that set of people interested in learning the set of skills actually needed in the current market.  No more making do with what you have, and spending valuable time inhouse shaping that one person into the ways and methods of how they do something, reversing months and years of what they learnt in class negating the study that person spent thousands of money on to get the job.  What do you think?"

newzealand,3e0gw7,dmanww,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:14 2015 UTC,Honest Question: What sort of individual economic situations lead to the OCR going up?  I ask as I wonder at the risk that some people might be tempted to overstretch in the current hyped housing market while interest rates are so low.
newzealand,3e0gw7,ThaFuck,4,Tue Jul 21 01:29:57 2015 UTC,Inflation is one of the big impacts on the OCR. Currently it is low and to prevent it falling out of the 1-3% range the RBNZ is lowering the OCR to encourage people to spend as they get low returns from money in the bank or can borrow money cheaply. If inflation was high the OCR would go up to discourage people from spending as they can get reasonable returns from money in the bank.

I wouldn't be too upset except for the following.   When miss15 started high school last year she had to have her own device. Miss 15 didn't want to use mums spare laptop, nor did she want the chrome book the school had worked out a very reasonable deal for.  Miss 15 wanted an iPad.  I was against this as spreadsheets, word processing etc are a pain on a tablet.  Miss 15 insists that as I'm old I have no idea what what I'm talking about. Mum took miss 15 to the mall to buy a chrome book and came home with a brand new iPad.  No big deal, carry on  Earlier this year it was my birthday and the wife was asking me what I wanted.  I had been eyeing up a cheap little tablet mainly to read books so a $150 android tablet would have done the job perfectly well.    On the day of my birthday, i open the package that's clearly a tablet and pull out an iPad!  ""This is a bit over the top"" I think to myself. Upon closer inspection it's pretty clear that its second hand, ""is this yours?"" I ask miss 15 and she replies in the affirmative, then when I asked what she would use for school she honest to fucking God says to me ""tablets are too hard to do excel and that stuff on so mum has bought me a laptop"". Mum not only has bought her a laptop, mum has got her a top of the line Apple Macbook worth about $3k. But I'm told not to worry because miss 15 had worked out a payment plan to mum where she would be paying x amount per week.  So yesterday it clicked in my head when I realised miss 15 made 3 payments totalling about $20 that I am typing this wall of fucking text on an iPad that cost me about three and a half thousand dollars."

We're not too badly off but her circle of friends consists of some girls from extremely wealthy families so peer pressure and all that.

But, part of financial management is regular reporting. If I didn't present my wife with an updated balance sheet and cashflow projection every week, she'd be jumping in and working it out for herself independently. Doing the planning work doesn't mean I get to not bother about proactively sharing the information.  Might I recommend the same general approach to you?  Edit: And, of course, any four-figure spending decisions are never made unilaterally by either of us. That would just be bad form."
newzealand,3dyio5,kochipoik,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying and fully agree. I'm kept up to date with the big picture, we don't have any debts at all so usually only need to look at the bank accounts and the wife puts together a little report every month of our investments etc.  This was buried in the details which to be honest I leave up to her for the most part."

I lack spawn of my own, but I've talked to my parents about raising them (In my opinion, they did it right). They told me that they had regular talks about how they were doing and what the rules/boundaries were for particular things.  This sounds like a breakdown in communication between yourself and your partner. It's hard, but comms is a skill, and it takes practise.  Stick in there bro."

Being treated like I am stupid doesn't work too good either.  From a neutral standpoint I would humbly suggest you take some serious time before you discuss (and please, don't confront). From the silver lining angle, you basically have a golden ticket to go buy a Harley or something."

Most patients in that situation get general anaesthetic, but he was an alcoholic and might not have come out from under at the other end, so all he got was a muscle relaxant and a mild sedative.  It wasn't a happy time for either one of us.  Probably worse for him, on balance."

newzealand,3e015d,term0r,12,Mon Jul 20 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Finally something I can agree with from the Labour party. I can wholeheartedly agree that smoking inside shouldn't be allowed, as any smoker with common courtesy would agree with, but banning it outside as well is just straight punishment with the only reason being that non smokers don't have to deal with the 2nd hand smoke. I try to be as courteous as I can, I understand that people just hate the smell with a passion, and if there is a backspace at the bar specifically made for smokers to go outside I will use it. Its like people who constantly complain about 2nd-hand are assuming that smokers are not trying to hide it, we really are!

As a non-smoker I also from time to time like to sit in the outdoor section of restaurants and cafes, and occasionally walk along the sidewalk where groups of smokers tend to congregate. Why should I suffer a closed chest and difficulty breathing caused by smokers in these areas? I think smoking should be banned everywhere, except in your own home."
newzealand,3e015d,gtphanta,5,Tue Jul 21 02:25:57 2015 UTC,Not sure why you are getting down voted - many of the premium outside areas are made effectively unavailable to people who want to avoid smoke - not just asthma but if I take my kids to a cafe we have to sit indoors.

newzealand,3e015d,SinfulSound,4,Tue Jul 21 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't smoked for years, but I still meet the most interesting people hanging out in the smokers areas."
newzealand,3e015d,NewMunster,4,Mon Jul 20 23:05:29 2015 UTC,Exactly! I have met amazing people in the smoking areas. Just saw my German friend off last week as the end of his WHV. Met him out having a smoke. He was the bouncer at the bar but still.
newzealand,3e015d,NewMunster,6,Tue Jul 21 04:11:06 2015 UTC,I bet u/ripssare is one of those people that obnoxiously cough when they are around smokers.
newzealand,3e015d,OctochaetusMultipora,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:59 2015 UTC,He's apparently pretty passionate about it.
newzealand,3e015d,spondooly,5,Tue Jul 21 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"Good. Banning smoking outdoors is redundant, as claiming it's for ""health reasons"" ignores all the other particulate matter floating around in the air."
newzealand,3e015d,Flan_diddly_anders,-11,Tue Jul 21 08:13:54 2015 UTC,Second hand smoke is particularly dangerous. There's no safe level of exposure and it has immediate adverse health effects.  http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/
newzealand,3e015d,boneywasawarrior_II,7,Tue Jul 21 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"So is breathing in smog, car exhausts etc."
newzealand,3e015d,sakebukkake,0,Tue Jul 21 02:04:26 2015 UTC,No safe level of exposure?  That sort of statement seems a bit ludicrous.
newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:36 2015 UTC,"Smoker for twenty years (clean for four) - hate to tell you this smokers, but your outside smoke is just as fucking disgusting as inside smoke."
newzealand,3e015d,ThaFuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:20 2015 UTC,huh
newzealand,3e015d,boneywasawarrior_II,8,Tue Jul 21 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"I know it is the minority opinion on here because ""dey took my rights"", but it annoys me that this argument is always framed as smokers losing their rights, as opposed to non-smokers having their rights reinforced. It is practically impossible to enjoy the outdoor areas of cafes/restaurants without having to endure cigarette smoke. There should not be the expectation that if you are out and want to enjoy the outdoor area with your meal/drink, you have to be willing to put up with second hand smoke."
newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,5,Tue Jul 21 12:10:16 2015 UTC,"A non-smoker doesn't have the right to have everyone act in accordance to their wishes, no-one does. The point of making people smoke outside is to protect harm to others to the point that it is fairly negligible. That upholds the right for non-smokers to be protected from the harmful health effects of smokers.   Anyway, judging by where I live there are plenty of places that have outdoor areas that don't allow smoking. If a cafe or restaurant want to ban it they can, if they don't it is probably because people value having a smoke with their coffee more than others value not having to put up with it."
newzealand,3e015d,rwmtinkywinky,-12,Mon Jul 20 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it should be banned in public altogether. I'm basically barred entry to any outside areas because other people have a disgusting addiction and no will power."
newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,15,Tue Jul 21 07:58:54 2015 UTC,Well aren't you just a precious little soul.
newzealand,3e015d,ThaFuck,-6,Tue Jul 21 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, one that would rather not get cancer."
newzealand,3e015d,rwmtinkywinky,12,Tue Jul 21 00:51:52 2015 UTC,Please. You have less chance of getting Cancer from a smoker exhaling a mouthful of smoke outside than from the sun that shines outside.  Get over yourself you precious hypochondriac twat.
newzealand,3e015d,ThaFuck,4,Tue Jul 21 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"If I may jump in here (and I will point out that I don't necessarily agree that smoking should be banned in public), your point may be true, but the difference is you make the choice to go out in the sun, very rarely do you make the choice to inhale second hand smoke, rather you have that choice thrust upon you by others."
newzealand,3e015d,rwmtinkywinky,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"I do on some degree agree that smoking in public can be a nuisance to people who don't agree with it and/or have health issues. People shouldn't have to walk down the road during the day and just accept the 2nd hand smoke, because it is bad, there's no denying that.  But on the other hand, if you're wanting to go outside at a cafe or a bar, or decide to head into town for a night out at courtnaey place and expecting a smoke-free time, get real. Everyone is just looking to have a good time, don't ruin it for other people."
newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"If your notion of having a good time is other people can't, then that's why you'll be labeled an asshole for your behavior."

newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:23 2015 UTC,"True. But I wonder how many other health-related things humans do to others in a second hand way publicly? Using cell phones? Smokey cars? Loud cars?   OP made it sound pretty much a given that he will suffer health issues due to a person smoking in a public place. In most cases, he wouldn't even inhale anything."
newzealand,3e015d,mypetcoelacanth,0,Tue Jul 21 20:55:19 2015 UTC,Using cellphones? You're not some nut job that believes they cause cancer right?
newzealand,3e015d,mypetcoelacanth,0,Tue Jul 21 02:58:04 2015 UTC,No. But there's a reason why they tell people to not use them at gas stations you fucking moron.
newzealand,3e015d,Guigoumonster,0,Tue Jul 21 09:26:53 2015 UTC,"You mean mythology? Zero ways a cellphone can trigger a gas explosion that wouldn't be triggered by numerous other means. Do you use your car remote at a gas station?  Idiots. Why are people so clueless about cellphones.  Edit: lol, down voted when facts disagree with your world view? :)"
newzealand,3e015d,mypetcoelacanth,-11,Tue Jul 21 09:31:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for agreeing.
newzealand,3e015d,gtphanta,8,Tue Jul 21 09:38:49 2015 UTC,"Right, so basically what I'm getting form your point of view is that you think your rights are more important than mine or anyone else who happens to be a smoker. We are adults who can make up our own mind on what we do, we are also fully aware of the risks associated with smoking, but we choose to anyway, why? Because we're adults and we can. You can take steps to avoiding 2nd-hand just as well as we can do our best to hide it, don't pretend the outside world is a dangerous or scary place that's barred off to you because you didn't get your way."
newzealand,3e015d,Avjunza,-6,Tue Jul 21 01:39:19 2015 UTC,Umm you don't have the right to inflict harm on someone else lol.
newzealand,3e015d,tmnvex,6,Tue Jul 21 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"And I don't believe I am. Most bars usually have a designated smoking spot anyway, I suppose you just lack the common sense to just, y'know, leave them alone."
newzealand,3e015d,Nzrainmaker,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:09:57 2015 UTC,You seem to think you do lol. The designated smoking spot is anywhere outside - that's my point.
newzealand,3e015d,SinfulSound,6,Tue Jul 21 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"I don't smoke anywhere else other than my property and outside bars if I happen to be at one. I'm trying to be a part of the solution, you're just a crybaby."
newzealand,3e015d,Nzrainmaker,-11,Tue Jul 21 01:14:30 2015 UTC,How about you keep your disgusting habit on your private property. Thanks.
newzealand,3e015d,SinfulSound,8,Tue Jul 21 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"The actual impact of the occasional amount of second hand smoke is much less likely to do you longterm damage, compared to say, stressing out about people smoking, outside, in the same general location as you."

The jelly was okay but it also used to be a little less watery and more solid.  Overall a piss poor effort. It was so watery it fell off the stick before I could eat the second half.  In comparison I had some bottom of the barrel mint chocolate trumpets from some unpopular brand. The ice cream was creamy and the chocolate... chocolaty.  The idea of kiwifruit ice cream sounds nice but Tip top and their owner, Fonterra, can fuck right off. You can't fool us.  Also ain't nobody want this fucking WHITE chocolate. The bean counters have figured out that cocoa is getting expensive so they're trying to create cocoa free products."

You can get a day pass for the gondola and you mountain bike, so it will take you up and you bike down.   I've been here, and it's pretty good. Nice views over shotover, and sometimes you see the jetboat zipping around: http://www.onsen.co.nz/. There's also a spa nearby that people seem to like.   I think there's horse treks out Glenorchy way.  You can skate at the ice rink sometimes.   What kind of stuff are you thinking?"

For a more relaxing time, there's a couple of mini-golf places (one indoor, one outdoor) on the way to the gondola.  I know you mentioned drinking already, but have you seen this place:  http://www.thewinery.co.nz/  I've never tried it, but I've been inside a few times. Looks like fun, and dangerous ($$)"
newzealand,3e0itx,Canerbry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"Walks, there's heaps of amazing free walks around the township, go to the DOC office and talk to them. The ones around the lakeshore are of course quite flat, up the hills not so much. Moke Lake and Mt Crighton are top walks close to town.  Hire a bike and ride all the way to the end of Kelvin Heights and back, that should take most of a day if you do it real leisurely.  If you hire a car, the drives to Glenorchy; Arrowtown & Gibbston; Bannockburn or across to Wanaka on the Crown Range are awesome. I'd go to Peregrine, Gibbston Valley, Chard Farm, stop and watch people jumping off the bungy bridge, and end up at Amsifield for wine and nibbles.  It's the ultimate tourist thing really but the Earnslaw is a great trip on a nice day, that lake is magnificent and this is the cheapest way to get out on it. The Gondola is pretty thrilling too, goes without saying but the views are incredible.  Relax and enjoy the surroundings! The scenery is incredible, especially by the lake.  If you want to spend money, the scenic flights are the very best thing you can do. Choppers are a magnitude more expensive but totally mind-blowing experience, total sensory overload. Cessna flights to Milford etc are great.  And, um, get a puffer jacket.  Source: Former Hotel Concierge"

Obviously somebody local was just getting a woodburner going and it was producing huge amounts of wood smoke, and the temporary condition of clouds overhead about to bring rain....a few minutes before the front blew in the wind...and all that smoke was being held down close to the ground.  That's normal in some places.  We have it pretty good here - where it's a shock when you don't breathe clean fresh air."

newzealand,3e0kjb,grantrobertsonmp,7,Tue Jul 21 01:09:32 2015 UTC,That's not even remotely how it works
newzealand,3e0kjb,krumms0r,20,Tue Jul 21 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm really cautious of this statement from Turia:   ""The fact that it's now become a depleted resource is not the fault of tangata whenua, it is the fact that most of our resources have been destroyed.  ""It's not unusual to accept that many of our bird species that were part of cultural take have been depleted hugely as well.""   I was pretty shocked reading the following, and it has made me question the historical record of kaitiakitanga. I don't know enough to really make a judgement, though.  From Tim Flannery's The Future Eaters (1994):   With the extinction of the moa, the Maori were forced to rely upon other, more difficult-to-obtain resources. The smaller birds bore the brunt of the hunting effort on land and many either become extinct or suffered dramatic range retractions. The huia...was nearing extinction by the time of European contact, surviving only in a tiny portion of its former range. Likewise, the takahe...had vanished from everywhere except for a few lonely valleys in Fiordland, while the meaty kakapo, formerly the most common of birds, had been exiled to the remote mountains and remained tolerably abundant only in Fiordland.  New Zealand's marine mammals had also suffered a dramatic decline due to over hunting. Prior to the arrival of the Maori at least three species of seals had bred throughout the length of the New Zealand archipelago and several others were regular visitors. The three tonne elephant seals were early victims of overexploitation and their breeding colonies vanished quickly. They were followed rapidly into local extinction by the half-tonne sea-lion... But the smallest species, the 200 kilogram New Zealand fur seal..., hung on - just. By 1600 AD all breeding colonies of fur seals on the North Island and northern South Island had been exterminated. By 1800 AD they had gone from everywhere north of Dunedin on the east cost and Fiordland on the west, only those in the most remote south-western corner of New Zealand surviving. There is no doubt that had things continued as they were, they would soon have been eliminated from this last icy refuge by Maori hunters.  Even fish populations were affected by overexploitation. Snapper...for example, was fished early on in the South Island, but then vanishes from the archaeological record, suggesting a local extinction. The average size of snapper declines throughout its distribution in New Zealand over time, suggesting that the fishery was being overexploited by the Maori. Interestingly, the average size of fish hooks also decreases, although whether in response to a decrease in fish size, or a shortage of moa bone... is not clear.  It might seem scarcely believable that the Maori could overexploit such a difficult-to-obtain resource as snapper, but archaeologists have estimated that the northern Northland Maori would have taken about 1200 tonnes of snapper per year. The modern commercial fishery, with its 100 vessels, lands only 1000 tonnes per year and this probably exceeds the maximum sustainable catch, as stocks have been declining since the 1980s. Even such humble resources as shellfish show signs of overexploitation, for as more desirable foods vanished people turned increasingly to less desirable food sources. Large limpets...all but vanish from the Coromandel Peninsula and many other mollusc species decline in size throughout New Zealand.   (I also posted this after Sonny Tau was caught with the kereru.)"

If you think that the Māori cultural practice of eating Kererū on certain occasions should be barred but also get upset at the idea that cats could be barred from New Zealand you should look at your biases.

newzealand,3e0kjb,threalseymourskinner,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"A few things I've heard on the radio and read in comments sections got me a bit peeved. A few of my thoughts:   Maggie Barry made a very poor statement regarding Maori and moa. While it is certain that hunting contributed to their extinction, deforestation and habitat loss was also central to the process. Accusing Maori of eating all the moa is also a dog whistle to those who somehow think that agitating against the (false, and not useful) 'green lens' (credit to James Belich for the term) that Maori are often viewed through today somehow undermines the Treaty or the concept of kaitiakitanga.  Other endangered species such as Takahe and Kiwi are not going to be eaten. Shouldn't even need saying, really, but the hand wringers are out there!  DOC provided the iwi with the kereru. I haven't seen any confirmation of how the kereru were harvested.  Polynesians could not have settled and survived in New Zealand without major environmental modification. They did not bring any domesticated animals except the polynesian dog and rat, both of which were food sources. Moa translates to chicken. They could not grow taro, the kumara they had only grew well up north, and the island abounded with easy protein.  Kaitiakitanga is a cultural response to the little ice age and the environmental and humanitarian disaster it constituted.    That said, kereru are central to the survival of our forests. They and kaka are central to the reproductive cycles of our berry-producing trees. You should see the amount of saplings under their favourite roosting trees growing out on Motuihe Island, they shit life! I'd like to know where DOC got the kereru and how. If they were harvested solely for feathers and food, I'm pretty torn. Seems like something that elders, conservationists and politicians need to discuss and clarify. If they were found dead or injured and then handed over, that's A-OK with me."
newzealand,3e0kjb,chullnz,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're being very generous to Maori with respect to your Moa comment, what do you think caused the habitat loss?"

""Auckland house prices have been identified as an issue of social concern for the New Zealand people.""  ""But allowing open access to speculation by foreign investors is likely to be exacerbating the issue.""  Highlighted the relevant points, and the reason Aucklanders in particular are getting rather panicky.  I'm a born and bred Aucklander, and it seems now myself and others like me are being told to like it or lump it, that we have no hope whatsoever of living in our hometown, and even some are going so far as to say that we shouldn't have any expectation to own a home in our hometown, and even that we are secondary to people who come from foreign countries.   In our own country we are being told that we are of far lower importance than a foreigner with no intention of living here at all. This is quite off p****** and remarkably unfair given the generations of tax others like me [and our families} have paid to the economy of NZ.  If our own Government is against us, what does that tell us?   It wouldn't really matter how many non-resident buyers there actually are. The fact that the situation even exists makes the above statement undeniably correct. All that's left is what you think about it as a kiwi.

The price is inflated by property owners using land as a store of wealth and passively earning income through capital gain. You shouldn't be able to earn money this way — you should have to make use of land to earn any money off it.  We need an 100% capital gains tax on land.

I really don't give a fuck who, it is the media and politicians who mention specific nationalities in the debate, not me, ever, you can look if you like.  People who can't see past the racism that the media is painting here are too naive for me to engage with.   This is about simple logic.  If all residential properties in New Zealand are owned and being rented by people in ""Esperantoland"" then New Zealanders are functionally paying taxes to Esperantoland without government interference.   If it is 30% Esperantolanders, 30% Martians, 30% a random Hippogriff and 10% New Zealanders who own all land in NZ, and the majority of commercial and residential property is owned by people who neither possess NZ citizenship nor reside there at any point in time, then 90% of New Zealand is functionally owned by and pays land tax to non-New Zealanders.   This mentions nothing of the simple fact, that if your goal in buying a house is to profit from someone else living in it, it means the rent you charge needs to be higher than the cost of maintainence."

newzealand,3dvmv3,NickRivieraPhD,13,Sun Jul 19 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"It really depends how well the media choose to understand and present the issue. The important thing is that Labour never extrapolated a number of foreign buyers. It just said 'here are the number of likely to be Chinese buyers, here are the number of Chinese residents. There is a discrepancy.' However Key is already saying (in this article) that the number Labour did give (39.5%) was given as non-resident buyers. Key has said he expects the 'vast bulk' of them to be residents.       Labour will always be able to celebrate a win from this if they have actually motivated the government to collect and release some actual data. But say the data shows 80% of sales to Chinese are to residents, and the other 20% were to foreigners. That would show a 'problem' as significant as anyone wants to make it, I would think most sensible people would think that was a significant number but more likely the simple fact that a large majority of Chinese buyers were in fact residents would result in Labour looking wrong (despite the fact that they wouldn't be).      I don't know, man, I am such a cynic about the opposition's ability to frame and win against Key, Crosby Textor and generally shitty political coverage that I think this will end up bad for Labour like it seems everything they've ever done has been since KiwiBuild."

newzealand,3dvmv3,itnz,12,Sun Jul 19 23:35:17 2015 UTC,My 2 cents.   The data is not going to be collected. It's simply not in the interest of the investors. They will block and moan to death if any attempts are made to fix the lopsided real estate market. Even now the data isnt being logged because someone wisely knew that regulations can be based on it.   And if buyer data collection begins then they are going to poison it so much that its useless.

It isn't sustainable, which is why we have so many laws and regulations. The kind of capitalism we do have is susceptible to political pressure. This can be good and bad."
newzealand,3dvmv3,lowercase_capitalist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the 'kind of capitalism' we have in practice, it simply isn't correct to attribute the failures of a system of private profits and public losses to capitalism. If anything, bailing out banks is a concession from capitalism. If a vegan eats beef and a cow dies as a consequence, you wouldn't attribute the cow's death to veganism just because many vegans cheat would you?"

newzealand,3dvmv3,OldWolf2,13,Mon Jul 20 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"This is true - and it's a scary fact.  If we can level off house prices, they will take 30 odd years for inflation to catch up with a decent house to income ratio.  If we do nothing, we get a bubble popping somewhere in the mid term - or we are priced out of our own country.  You're not going to please everyone here, that's for sure."
newzealand,3dvmv3,Avjunza,4,Mon Jul 20 00:46:00 2015 UTC,The voting bloc that owns houses (and puts their house value above all other issues) knows what will happen if Labour gets in. So they will already vote accordingly. They won't need to vote Labour in once just to see what happens.

Houses become more affordable. The government can afford to reduce other taxes. The economy grows because tax rates are lowered and because investors are now putting their money in businesses not land.  Everyone's happy.  Property speculators lose their main source of income.  They take the National party out to dinner.  The tax gets removed and we're back to square one."

newzealand,3dvmv3,ilektwix,3,Sun Jul 19 23:15:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe kiwis ought to stop selling to the highest bidder then.  And/Or create a yet another false market.    Whoever y'all find to blame, the matter stands -- Kiwi retirement and end-of-life costs are met with money rolling in offshore.    With market as it stands and outlook neither terribly bleak nor positive, Kiwis (or property sellers) have gained the most at this turn.    I just wish people would stop putting this money into acquiring German cars."
newzealand,3dvmv3,nickwhy,22,Mon Jul 20 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe kiwis ought to stop selling to the highest bidder then.   See, that's where this shit takes a turn from uncomfortable to actually racist. You can't look someone up and down and then decide you won't trade with them because of their ethnicity. Or at least you shouldn't, because that's a fucked up thing to do.  I feel like a lot of people are approaching this whole thing from the wrong angle. This isn't anybody's ""fault"". You can't blame an individual person for making a rational investment decision, wherever they're from. The problem is the lack of appropriate regulations, the result of which is that Auckland real estate is a far more attractive investment than just about anything else. This has been going on for years, and it's damaging whether it's NZ residents or foreign speculators doing the buying. The only reason that ""foreign"" is even an issue is scale: the number of players and the amount of money completely dwarfs our physical market, leading to wild and crazy upswings like we've seen in the past few years.  The only people to ""blame"" are the policymakers who've allowed this to happen."
newzealand,3dvmv3,sixincomefigure,7,Mon Jul 20 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"I agree: but the policy makers will not have anything to answer, because they have denied that there is a problem.    Yeah it's more than a little strange that a stately home in Beverly Hills is equal to a damp hole in Grey Lynn.    But lots of kiwis are benefiting amazingly, thanks to these buyers.  And these people will move all they can to keep the money flowing in.  Realtors are laughing all the way to the bank.    With our landmass and economic projections, this is clearly a policy issue.  There is no way such a damp box could be worth so much (if it were, most of our lives are actually worthless).  Don't let the media turn it into a race one.  (they try every day)  It's more about the landowners and policymakers trying to cash in without giving a toss about what this will do down the line.  And they will bring up the subject of non-white immigrants as a scapegoat.  Stupid people like to be told what is good and bad.  non-white people are visibly easy to target.    And to think that the guys in red (Labour people) will be more caring (or have easy clear solutions) is painfully naïve."

newzealand,3dvmv3,Potassium39,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"We've all voted them in. Labour didn't do anything to fix the issue during their last term either, and prices shot up then too."

At least Labour have been acknowledging there's a problem and they were campaigning on policies to address the issue, while National's platform was 'What problem?'. Nope - a lot of people who supported National in the last election did so because they were perfectly happy to see prices skyrocketing as long as they got a piece of the action, and that's the uncomfortable truth."

newzealand,3dvmv3,keyo_,5,Mon Jul 20 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"the first person who refuses to take the highest bid from an Asian would get painted a dirty racist all over the media   well, that's obviously racist.  Is it okay if said Asian presented a NZ passport?  I think that's still crummy thing to do too.    I guess my point was that it should not be seen as a race issue, at all.  It's a policy issue that has seen lapse in management.  But the thing to take note is NZ's desire for this type of cashflow."
newzealand,3dvmv3,Delphinium1,2,Mon Jul 20 05:13:24 2015 UTC,Is there much evidence elsewhere around the world that non-resident buyers are driving up prices (versus immigrants)? It's commonly cited as a major reason for the price boom in Vancouver but data there is just as patchy and immigration accounts for a huge portion of it given that the city is ~40% Chinese. Australia has some controls but prices in Sydney are still skyrocketing.   The reason for the price increase doesn't have to be non-resident buyers - it's been increasing since about 2002 and it could well be simply because people like to live in big cities. Auckland is a very popular destination for immigrants as well as NZer's moving there for work.
newzealand,3dvmv3,keyo_,8,Mon Jul 20 00:53:55 2015 UTC,"If the buyers are using their visa holding relatives to purchase property then that's pretty foreign to me, but won't show up as such.

Labour are absolutely right about the searchable register. We need to be able to query by what kind of visa/residence the owners had at the time of purchase.   A publicly searchable register? That brings up a lot of privacy concerns for me."
newzealand,3dvmv3,keyo_,5,Mon Jul 20 01:40:42 2015 UTC,You can already find owners names on LINZ. This would just be adding price and visa data as well.
newzealand,3dvmv3,Delphinium1,3,Mon Jul 20 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"visa data   And this is something I have an issue with being public knowledge. It's not necessary for everyone in the neighbourhood to know that someone is present on a work visa (""taking our jobs"" etc). I think an internal government register is fine but don't like the idea of opening it up to the public."
newzealand,3dvmv3,TouchMyselfAtNight,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"I guess you've got a point. The technology does exist, like stats NZ uses, to hide names, birth dates etc from from aggregate query results. It can be partially public.  I wouldn't want National, or any department to cherry pick the information they release though."
newzealand,3dvmv3,Lightspeedius,3,Mon Jul 20 03:15:03 2015 UTC,I could handle something like Stats NZ does but that would likely involve them doing the analytical work to aggregate the data first. They are pretty independent so there isn't really an issue there.
newzealand,3dvmv3,dmanww,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"Key said any non-resident buying from China was likely to be a much smaller figure than the 39.5% presented by Labour and that the decision to release the data would not work politically. He said the Government would soon have better data on the amount of non-resident buying and remained open to considering actions if necessary, although he personally believed the level of foreign buying was not a significant factor in Auckland.   Not basing any immediate decisions on poor data and waiting until we have a better handle on the true number before making any decisions.  That seems pretty reasonable to me."
newzealand,3dvmv3,MasterEk,28,Sun Jul 19 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Except the same issue (non-residents buying up property) was raised an issue in 2013 by Labour (who got accused of racism then as well, despite not singling out Chinese investors).

'We don't have the information' has been a line for years.  Now the pressure is building they are 'Bringing it in at the end of the year' - which is very minimal data collecting.  THe longer they drag their feet, the better it works for them politically.  Nats are political playing games here."
newzealand,3dvmv3,NewMunster,9,Sun Jul 19 23:44:49 2015 UTC,"The default position should be to protect NZ land from being sold out. There is no need to base this on statistics. Besides, everyone, including Key, knows the problem is Chinese wealth. It's so damn obvious.  It's the political equivalent of ignoring smoke because you can't see fire.  National are selling out NZ to make the economy look good, and fill their own pockets. This is not reasonable it's simply a transfer of wealth."

newzealand,3dvmv3,Avjunza,-3,Mon Jul 20 09:59:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Sherlock. Now, are said politicians (not limited to the National Party) selling their houses and buying additional ones?

You're right that New Zealanders also have an attitude that property can only go up and you gotta buy a rental.   And, oddly enough, when you get enough people with enough cash interested in something, the value of said something increases. If housing prices have increased substantially since 2008, and this is just a wild theory that obviously isn't the same as the fact based ""Blame the Chinese for everything"" argument put forwards by morons educated individuals, that perhaps a lot of people who were not sure their money was safe in finance companies and turned to property instead? I mean, when you have a dozen or so finance companies wiping billions of people's life savings within the space of a few weeks, that's going to make people think twice about letting others look after their money, isn't it? Why not invest it in something that you could make money off in the long term?    However you see the same thing in Vancouver, San Francisco, Sydney etc.   Funnily enough, Vancouver and San Francisco all have extremely large (much larger than Auckland's population) populations of resident Chinese.    I'm not digging deeper as you're wilfully ignorant though.   No, I'm just not a racist."

What's to stop Joe Immigrant, who holds residency, from buying property with Jack Livesinasia's money, holding a private contract between the two in another country?  Do you really think that we collect data on companies established in New Zealand, who own rental properties, and then post facto become owned by foreign interests? Of course we don't.   The supply equation is an interesting one, primarily because of the number of empty dwellings currently sitting in Auckland. By all accounts it seems that they outnumber the number of properties on the market by a factor of 2 or more!"

If someone complained to WINZ because they knew the guys are WINZ employees and wanted to get them into extra trouble, well, I hope that wouldn't fly.  If, on the other hand, they were suggesting they could use their jobs to cause trouble as well as being racist..."

I don't have the advantage of being in a bar with bouncers and other people, I'm completely alone most of the time. The police and DLA are uninterested and tell me I should just call the police and hope I don't get hurt before they show up, or serve them and risk my job, my liquor license and my bosses business. There's no middle ground, no way of telling for sure that someone has been drinking (I've refused service to a stroke victim by accident), no way of protecting myself without breaking the law and no way of knowing whether or not any of my shitbag customers are going to follow through with their threats to follow me home or wait outside for when I finish.

I didnt know it at the time because I was partying at Uni and not looking at the politics, but my analysis is AU Norml was started by that guy Graeme whatever who was right wing liberterian and hated left wing AUSA.  Therefore AU Norml was regarded by Bombers mates as an enemy of the left wing.   The freedom of University students to smoke weed on campus openly and debate issues of the day was a bit too liberterian for Bomber, so he decided to narc on the whole Common Room buzz, he informed the Police, the media, etc, and the University were keen to shut down a party buzz.  Funnily enough, all that political bollix and control style politics, combined with getting rid of a partying focus, ended up with AUSA losing all its funding and buildings, which sucks.  For those younger, back in the day(1990s)at Auckland University the Upper Common Room was available to smoke ganja in all day, Police werent allowed on Campus without Uni permission. Could smoke inside and outside on the balconies.  Hang your head in shame Bomber, I think destroying the Upper Common Room was like getting rid of the Student Pub because personally you dont like drinking. And now the students dont even know that stuff existed. Being able to smoke a joint inside the UCR after a class, with some other students, was awesome."

Is public transit as convenient as your own car - hell no.  I've lodged a few complaints for cancellations and (considerably) late service over the last 6 months, and I frankly wasn't impressed by AT's response to complaints.

newzealand,3dxbu7,mrwendel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:46 2015 UTC,Bus services are infrequent and regularly well off the timed service (if they come at all). In other words a complete shit show.   People need to start taking public transit and allow them to ramp up frequency until it starts to be less of a 'shitshow'.   Get fucked.
newzealand,3dxbu7,Hubris2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"I have taken Auckland's trains for 10 years, and the last six months have been terrible. Every single day a train is either delayed or cancelled. Every day. And I can trace it back to when they introduced the electric trains. I can allow some time to sort out issues but it's getting worse, not better, and AT's communication is absolutely awful (their Twitter feed appears to have given up notifying us of cancellations, and their texting service just plain doesn't work). There is no indication that it will improve anytime soon. And judging from Twitter and the transport blog, I'm not alone in experiencing poor service.   While I appreciate that people have to use the service in order for it to receive more funding, the fact is usage is up every year (I believe up 22% this year) and the government still pours money into motorways instead. I also think there's a real chicken and the egg scenario where people might try leaving the car at home and take the train, only to find it cancelled, or sitting outside Britomart for 15 mins, and go back to using their car.   Also, it's not up to customers to use a substandard service in the hopes of improving. The service has to be good enough to make them want to use it."
newzealand,3dxbu7,UnkaVal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:28:15 2015 UTC,"I have to admit - I take 2 buses to and from work every day, but I'm not a regular train rider - so I can't speak to the performance.  I have heard that there are a variety of technical 'bugs' in the electric trains that currently mean they are running slower than did the diesels."
newzealand,3dxbu7,Yurcoxafailin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:42:58 2015 UTC,"Which is of course why the rates are going up, so that they can build good transport infrastructure, but  yeah, Auckland doesn't want to think about that now does it?"
newzealand,3dxbu7,nerdlygames,11,Tue Jul 21 08:26:59 2015 UTC,So take the bus.
newzealand,3dxbu7,kiwisarentfruit,6,Mon Jul 20 09:16:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this this morning as I drove along the Pakuranga highway along with another 100,000 people who won't fit on the 10 or so buses we get. Unfortunately, unless Antman can mass produce his shrinking suit, we probably won't fit.    The infrastructure isn't there. I don't understand why people have this attitude against drivers who have no other option."
newzealand,3dxbu7,nerdlygames,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"If the infrastructure is there for drivers, it is definitely there for buses.  Not having enough buses on isn't an infrastructure issue, it is a scheduling issue."
newzealand,3dxbu7,Hubris2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:08 2015 UTC,"It is a money issue and an infrastructure issue, they don't have enough buses and we don't have enough bus lanes or a dedicated bus only lane like they do on the Shore. For there to be enough buses to accommodate South East Auckland, they would need to spend a shit load of coin. This would only drive the price up and make it even more expensive than driving. Sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario."
newzealand,3dxbu7,nerdlygames,4,Mon Jul 20 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"Likewise, people refusing to take the bus until there are hundreds of buses running largely empty to prove the capacity mean we never have the ridership in order to fund said buses.  I will accept complaints of ""the bus was so full it wouldn't stop""....but not ""from my car I see all these other cars so I'm justified in not even trying to take public transit""."
newzealand,3dxbu7,Hubris2,2,Mon Jul 20 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"I used to take the bus, but it is more expensive than driving and takes 90 minutes to get to town as opposed to 30 minutes in a car. THAT is the reason nobody takes the bus. Do you expect people to just take a massive hit to their already low pay by spending extra to take the bus, and also sit in traffic for 3 hours a day in the hope that some day more people might join them and also be out of pocket/time?"
newzealand,3dxbu7,nerdlygames,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"I think it'll take some actions that change behaviors in some quantity.  You are right....if you change and nobody else...it won't make much difference.  If we have 50 people on each bus rather than 45 cars on the road, our roads would flow much faster and we would all get there quickly.  Some activities like 'congestion charges' that force people to reconsider their behavior may change behaviors and bring improvements faster than people just deciding to 'spend more and take longer' solely out of a sense of responsibility."
newzealand,3dxbu7,Hubris2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"I do agree, but charging road users for the use of roads they have already paid for will not go down nicely. The bus companies won't lower their prices and slash their profits, so you'd be fucked either way. It would be nice if we had some sort of publicly owned bus companies around instead of Howick and Eastern buses in my area."
newzealand,3dxbu7,nerdlygames,3,Mon Jul 20 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'm annoyed by AT's move away from reasonably-priced monthly passes.  At present, I don't really worry about the 'price' of buses because I pay $140/month for as many rides as I choose within my zone.  That saves me money compared to paying for each trip...and also means I never consider whether to drive versus taking the bus because extra bus trips are 'free'.  The move to double the price of monthly passes is certainly a cash grab to force people into paying by the trip...which reintroduces the decision regarding expense that you mention."
newzealand,3dxbu7,Yurcoxafailin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm lucky that I carpool with my flatmate, so we're each saving on petrol and taking a car off the road. That's about as far as my budget will go. At the moment, the bus is for rich people."

newzealand,3dxbu7,Themcnuggetbandit,2,Mon Jul 20 09:30:52 2015 UTC,"This disincentivizes driving in general, so will stop people driving into town to get on the piss."
newzealand,3dxbu7,chrisbucks,6,Mon Jul 20 10:11:12 2015 UTC,"Except people still will because there is no public transport at all really on the weekends after 11pm, And when my 10 min taxi costs 40 bucks each way its still cheaper to drive and park"
newzealand,3dxbu7,Themcnuggetbandit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:05:11 2015 UTC,no public transport at all really on the weekends after 11pm   There are buses as late as 3.40am and the ferry to Devonport goes as late as 1am on Friday nights.
newzealand,3dxbu7,My_usrname_of_choice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:32 2015 UTC,If you have ever tried to catch those buses you would realise they fit no where near enough people and only run to the bus stations which are pretty far away from most resedintal areas.
newzealand,3dxbu7,Avjunza,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:53 2015 UTC,But driving at off peak times isn't an issue. It would cost more for a lot of people to get to town via other means

newzealand,3dxbu7,UnkaVal,2,Mon Jul 20 09:49:20 2015 UTC,Should really halve the number of parking buildings in the city and replace them with +30 floor high apartment/office blocks. The city is screaming for more people.
newzealand,3dxbu7,bittopia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:03 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea, and it's proven to work as well.  Levy a big congestion charge for anyone taking their car into the city, 50-75 dollars a day, then provide reasonably priced public transport infrastructure to cope with the number of people not driving.  London has upwards of 12 million people in it during a typical working day, and 3-4 Million of them come in by train.  Yup, roughly the population of NZ commute into and out of London every day.  Simply make it impossible for a large number of drivers to bring their cars in, toll all the motorways in, make money there, demand for buses goes up, make money there, maybe put in a good light rail network, make money there.  The amount of money made by TFL over here is just mind numbing, and that's not even a private company.  NZers show time and time again that they're not grown up enough to be allowed to drive cars, so stop them.  This is evident in the ""you take take my steering wheel from my cold, dead hands"" mentality, ably demonstrated by reading any Stuff comments section about petrol prices, public transport,  or god forbid, cycling."

Given the US$'s strength, prices are in-line with back home, at last.  ASOS is God's gift to those living in a country with limited retail options.    Ebay isn't bad, but many sellers are unwilling to deal with int'l shipping or charge exorbitant fees.  I prefer Amazon.    Smith and Caughey's has some decent stuff, but it ranges from moderately to grossly overpriced.    Much of the locally available stuff is of variable quality.  Stitching is shoddy, fabric is thin, lesser fabric/the cotton is rough, ""hardware"" (buttons, zippers) have a short lifespan - this has been an issue with stuff I've ordered from the iconic, picked up at the warehouse, and noticed at various other retailers.  I noticed this as well in Australia with brands/shops only in Oz.  It's almost as  if AUS/NZ is getting the second rate stuff (at first rate prices) that North American and Western European (lived in Britain) are rejecting or sending to absolute bottom retailers: ie a NZ$40 shirt that would get £5-10 (12-22) at Primark."

You can't remove just yourself from the contract -- you can only take actions that remove you all from the contract, and it's complicated to do so and will probably not work.  Your best course of action is to try a bit harder to get a new flatmate, and stay until they move in. Anything else you do will screw over your flatmates.  Here's the thing, though; even with a new flatmate, because you're on the contract you're still legally liable until the term ends -- the new person won't be. If the landlord takes your flatmates to tribunal or court for whatever reason, you'll have to be there as well, even if you're not physically living there."

Also use a change of bond form to move your portion of the bond to formally  the new flatmate. These forms are easy to find online (just google, I'm on the phone now so it's difficult to link to pdfs). Then the new flatmate can pay you your portion of the bond. It's not a huge process and I've done it many times. Good luck!"

Knowing who their landlord was, and having had them as a landlord myself, I can totally believe that, but it doesn't mean that what my friend did was right. He stopped paying rent on a fixed-term lease. There was a shitstorm of communications, and he kept promising to pay the rent, but he never did. After a while, he was taken to the tenancy tribunal, where he promised to pay the rent, and then didn't pay the rent. He told me this with a shit-eating grin.

I think you're overexaggerrating. Her actions will make no difference to the global trend. Perhaps in little old NZ things will slow down just a tad. But not by much. People will raise the question of her actions, but it's easily addressed by pointing out that (1) marijuana has numerous medicinal applications, and is relatively safe all things considered (No one has ever died from marijuana), and (2) she was doing what any mother would do to save her son (When a mother is told that her son has no chance, what do you expect her to do?? Stop trying??).  I think what you're going to find is that more people will support her than condemn her. And despite this situation, I think that global trends concerning medical marijuana legalization will have a greater influence on NZ legislation than one woman giving her son medical marijuana to help him when all else had failed."
newzealand,3dv8gn,lickmypopsicle,53,Mon Jul 20 12:15:57 2015 UTC,She administered an unspecified amount of a pharmaceutical product to her son at random while the doctors weren't looking and had no idea how that would interact with the complex drugs being administered by the medical professionals. This is scandalous. She could be culpable for his death. For an insight into the attitude of this person see here: https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/supportforalexsjourney/questions

newzealand,3dv8gn,Gareth321,28,Sun Jul 19 23:26:27 2015 UTC,Well you can bet she just set the cause back a fucking decade.  This is going to give medical marijuana in NZ an image that will be really difficult to shake off; even though popular opinion is that we should be looking at our drug laws again.  The unfortunate truth is that the people who will seize this as a failure and proof of the scary evil danger of marijuana are the ones who actually fucking turn up to vote.  I don't know what I'd do in her situation. She wanted her son to be comfortable and she wanted him to pull through. But it's just stupid not to listen to doctors. I have nothing but the utmost respect for medical professionals. It's absolutely fine to look for alternative treatment but to actively ignore and go against their plans is asking for complications.

If you just take a look at the trends around the world concerning medical marijuana (see U.S. for example with 23 states already legalized for medical use), one lady giving making a desperate attempt to save her sons life in NZ by administering him marijuana after doing her homework by looking at published studies is not even going to have an impact on peoples perceptions about the utility and validity of medical marijuana in the long run. The bottom line is that the world's perception of medical marijuana is evolving and becoming more informed the more research is done, and the war on drugs is just a big waste of tax payers dollars that could be better spent elsewhere.

newzealand,3dv8gn,computer_d,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:53 2015 UTC,"They sure are well documented and the shift in public perception in America is a very good sign.   But ideas don't always transition well to other countries. Look how fucking far behind we are in some areas (medicinal cannabis for one) and how far ahead of the curve we were for other social issues that took a long time to pick up pace elsewhere.   there is no longer any actual debate. It is now a political issue   So by definition there is still debate to be had. There are many arguments against marijuana that completely ignore/circumvent it's medicinal usefulness, mainly it's perceived status as a ""gateway drug"" and the social issues lumped in with it. I'm not defending this stance at all just pointing out the ingrained attitude we're struggling to fight.  Events like this can definitely set us back."
newzealand,3dv8gn,repelwithoutacause,8,Mon Jul 20 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The only reason we have a lack of transition are political parties. We're not going to have protests over making medical cannabis legalised. Recreational use has been mainstream for decades. NZ has the highest amount of smokers per capita in the world.  Any debate is a farce. Political parties holding the majority in governments stick by their policies and we're at a time where there are few radical/liberal governments in Western countries, it's all conservatives. National have adamantly refused to even look at drug reform in the face of over-whelming evidence suggesting reform is required. Even the Greens have dropped it from their policies. Not because further debate is needed but because their focus is now on other issues.  There is no longer any public input on the matter - I know that to be true for New Zealand."

Anecdotally, I have been told by a few accountants that they now have a lot of clients who bought into the property thing a few years ago, and are now not doing particularly well out of it, mostly because they came in based on feeling and not numbers.

newzealand,3dwki0,HeinigerNZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:36:41 2015 UTC,You have to pay capital gains on properties bought for the purposes of selling for a capital gain. IRD will be looking for that sort of behaviour.
newzealand,3dwki0,ThaFuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:23:29 2015 UTC,"Freakboy answers it a bit - maybe some people are looking to buy in before Oct 1st as they mistakenly believe that purchases before this date won't be subject to the CGT.  They would be wrong, as NZ already has a (loose) capital gains tax in place. If you buy a property with the intention of making a capital gain then you're liable for the tax. The onus to prove intent falls on the property owner, and so the IRD have been pulling sales records for a while now and hitting up people who have bought and sold a house within a short period of time (less than two years generally).  If investors are buying more property in Auck then another reason could be they are doing so while they still only require 20% deposit - this rises to 30% (for investment properties in Auck) from Oct 1st also."

Lots of people could try and dispute it, but, regardless, the basic idea of it is that information that exists has already been accounted for in price.  The implication is that right now there are people all over the show who are looking at the OCR, and looking at predictions for where the OCR will be, and making decisions based on that information. So, the dollar will already be priced to take into account the chances of OCR reductions. Any movements following the actual OCR change are ""corrections"", or counter measures to correct for people who bet that it wouldn't move, or that it would go up, etc."

If we imagine what the exchange rate would be if we knew that the OCR wasn't going to change and what it would be if we knew that it was going to drop, the actual exchange rate will be somewhere between these when we don't know. If the market thinks it will probably drop, it will be nearer the lower end, and vice versa. After the decision is announced, the exchange rate will almost instantaneously change to the upper or lower end of the spread, depending on the announcement.  Watch the constantly updated graph on the ANZ website after 9am on  announcement day. It always has a sudden change just after the announcement. Economics students I work with get a kick out of it."

newzealand,3dvtkm,keyo_,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hi Wild Asian  Yes it will, but there is more parts to the economy than the media report on and the politicians talk about, and the Reserve bank has obligations that it has to answer to."
newzealand,3dvtkm,scatteringlargesse,3,Sun Jul 19 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"Exports for one thing. The rationale is that a lower dollar will encourage more demand for our exports and so help out the farmers, like milk, but also others like meat and wool. The OCR is a mechanism of monetary policy to control inflationary pressures, and inflation was lower than expected (otherwise they would lower the OCR more if inflation was higher). Lowering the OCR also means banks will lower their interest rates, making mortgages easier for folks here. This encourages them to spend more as they'll have more disposable income, which in turn is assumed to increase consumption as it's another way to boost economic activity - since milk exports, a large part of our exports and contributor to our economy, has gone to shit. This puts upwards pressure on inflation, but since inflation is within target and is below what we'd need to worry about enough to increase the OCR, it's ok to do so. The OCR will be revised again the next time in response to this.   Also, the  RBNZ's obligation is to fiddle with the OCR in response to inflation, not our currency. The currency may be affected, but  inflation is of more significant concern to the economy as far as the RBNZ is concerned.   Moreover, if the housing market continues to grow via foreign investment, then the fall in NZD will eventually drive the demand for the dollar up again as foreign investors demand more NZD to buy more houses here.     Tl;dr: Yes, the housing market is a shit storm waiting to happen, and if it goes to shit, other things will also go to shit. But since it hasn't gone to shit yet, other things that can go to shit, the shit that could immediately make shit and shittier shit become even shittier shits (the shit that RBNZ shits itself over), needs to not go to shit, because if such shit does go to shit, then everything will really go to shit, make shit even shittier and become even shittier shits (arguably, much shittier than the housing shit) than the shit we are shitting ourselves over now. Ceteris paribus."

newzealand,3dvtkm,MasterEk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"If you look at the Chinese market, they are having both a deflating stock market and a deflating housing market. Chinese property was in a bubble few years ago, and i think many that did well on the property ladder are now looking for a chance to get out. Buying property in places like NZ which is still seen as reasonably cheap when compared to other major cities. There is also a small percentage that are wanting to convert/launder money and property is the best way to do it. I think once the Chinese stock market settles and their property prices reach more sustainable levels, we might see some NZ properties being sold up and the cash move back to China. Long term, Asia is where the money is going to be. Plus i suspect that if those that managed to time the Chinese bubble early, will most likely be smart enough to time Auckland's property bubble."

newzealand,3dw45j,HeinigerNZ,3,Mon Jul 20 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot about the ""supply issue"", but relatively little in-depth discussion of the Auckland district plans.   I'm pretty sceptical about just how many realistic opportunities for expansion there are.  Densification is the buzzword, but there's just so fucking little the council and the government can do about it. I'm not especially worried about height limits, but I'm really doubtful that they are a major limiting factor: smart developers will know kiwis won't buy in tower blocks.   Immigrants might and that's fine, although it feels like ghettoisation and segregation.   Dropping all limits on section sizes seems like a much better idea to me. Micro houses seem to be very on-trend at the moment. It's hardly a quick-fix though.  The urban boundary seems to be a bit arbitrary too (barring the giant fucking transport problems), and I accept that there are some excessive hoops to jump through for consents that you wouldn't even find in the QLDC. Auckland-specific solutions are clearly needed.  Maybe the best solution is just taking jobs the fuck out of Auckland though? ASAP. The Govt can find ways to incentivise that, and the market will come round to it too."

It's an inevitability that many (Read: All) world-class cities are facing and they haven't fallen over into a pile of shit.  The problem is that true blue Kiwis have grown up with the idea that a home must be on a 1/4 acre block and it must have 3 bedrooms. Immigrants from densely populated countries haven't. Apartment living has only caught on in the CBDs of both Auckland and Wellington yet nobody wants to rent or buy one, no matter how fucking handy they are.   Yes, taking the jobs out of Auckland and flooding the rest of the country with people that don't want to be there would be an idea but I don't think you understand how monumental of a task that is. It won't work. Not only will you have to convince a good portion of 1.5 million people to flee south but you'll have to convince the business community to do the same.

That's the government's job in addressing a crisis.   IN relation to medium-high density living the only thing the government can do in that regard is to ease the laws a little bit to allow developers to build up rather than swallowing up hectares of land in Manukau and building houses that nobody can afford. That seems like something that National will do in the coming months but you still have to deal with the issue of convincing Kiwi buyers to drop the 1/4 acre dream and to start being a little more practical. Won't be easy.    I have some anecdotal evidence that they don't actually really want to be in Auckland. Immigrants are probably a bit more OK with it.   I have no doubt that some people living in Auckland are over it but it is still a great city to live and work in. Immigrants that move here for the sake of finding work would set up quite nicely a bit further south but for now, Auckland is where the work is.   In theory the business community should be more cognisant of the effects of supply and demand than the general public. Though I might be underestimating the stupidity of the business community...   If a business could operate successfully in Hamilton, for example, it would but for a lot of SMEs it really is a matter of location. It's difficult to make a dent in the grand scheme of things when your head office is in a place that no customer or client knows about.   The large number of qualified people looking for jobs might be allowing them to dictate terms a little more than is ideal, and they're getting a poorer selection of quality employees than they realise.   It's particular true of new graduates that are straight out of Uni and are willing to move to Mars for a really good graduate position. For high profile companies based out of Auckland it's easy enough finding willing candidates but if this housing problem gets out of hand they may find it a bit tough down the road.  It's a doozy though."
newzealand,3dw45j,ElSalvo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:35 2015 UTC,"The important thing to remember is how a ‘densified’ city works. It is not just about building tall buildings all over the place; you need to have the infrastructure for denser housing. Principally, you need transport. In particular, if you really want things to work, you need rapid-transit public transport. And then you densify around the transport networks  Auckland has 3 kinds of rapid-transit public transport: trains, busways, and ferries. These are all independent of traffic, and allow for rapid, frequent, regular, and high-quality public transport. If you are in a location that is served by one of these, then this service is almost certainly faster and more reliable than driving a car in peak hour traffic. As a result, areas around train and busway stations are in high demand, and often have much higher density than neighbouring areas. Manurewa/Auckland isn’t a bad journey by train.  So that, right there, is one the Auckland and central governments need to encourage. They could be building busways on the Southern, Northwestern and Southwestern motorways, and the Ellerslie/Panmure or Mt Wellington highways, and they need to complete the Britomart tunnel. From there they could develop denser housing at the transport centres, as is already happening.  Until recently, a lot of ‘densification’ has just been in-fill housing. Without transport infrastructure, this is a recipe for disaster, and it is impossible prohibitively expensive to build high-quality public transport without a much clearer focus."

newzealand,3dw7d0,Dead_Rooster,4,Mon Jul 20 01:41:51 2015 UTC,Differs depending on the store. IIRC Farmers in New Lynn Auckland had changing rooms on the mens-clothing side and the womens-clothing side. Dunno if there were signs but you'd probably get weird looks if you switched sides.
newzealand,3dw7d0,computer_d,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:33 2015 UTC,I thought that was linking to Harold Life at first.
newzealand,3dw7d0,GiantCrazyOctopus,2,Mon Jul 20 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Departments stores used to all have fitting rooms buried deep within their gendered clothing sections, so they are by default gendered because people go to the closest one. Farmers still does this, usually due to the layout of the stores being set one way for so long.  If there's on block of them (eg Warehouse) it's usually gender neutral, but you will notice people still go to the ones nearest the relevant clothing section because Social Conventions.  I'd be surprised if trans women feel comfortable going to the ones men queue up at - and I fully expect arsehole Farmers staff will be singling out visibly trans trans women to use the ones with the line of men outside them when the women's ones are busy with ""oh but they're gender neutral""."

newzealand,3dw7d0,master5o1,6,Mon Jul 20 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"Oh shit. When I used to shop at Farmers (before Internet shopping, I guess) I always went to the ones by the mens' area. Queueues were always way shorter. I never knew they were gendered."

I was helping my wife with the curtain in one at a fancy shop a while ago and accidentally saw a woman in her undies through the gap in the curtain though and felt really guilty. Doors are much better than curtains, then everyone can do what they want without worrying about upsetting someone."
newzealand,3dw7d0,GiantCrazyOctopus,3,Mon Jul 20 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"Curtains are terrible! There was a store in Wellington (one of the cheap women's clothing stores) that had basically DIY'd their changing rooms out of tents or something. You did up the ""door"" with velcro. And none had their own mirror, you had to come out and wear it in front of everyone. I mean the store was cheap but yeesh"
newzealand,3dw7d0,SpongePuff,2,Mon Jul 20 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"Velcro is better than most of them! And they're like 3 metres high so it's impossible to get enough leverage to pull the curtain shut, you end up with a 3 inch gap where everyone can look in"

If all bathrooms were individual rooms with a toilet and sink and the doors opened into well lit and monitored corridors, yes, go ahead, that's fine. But with bathrooms as they are now I don't think it's a great plan.   I can't tell you the number of times bathrooms have been an escape from harrassment for me or a friend of mine, particularly in nightclubs and other public places. Having a readily accessible single sex space has been a godsend, although I imagine if all bathroom were single lockable rooms this would also suffice.    I wonder about the logistics of this- surely you wouldn't have urinals in a unisex bathroom? And you would have to equip all stalls with a sanitary disposal unit which is expensive.    Having said all that, I applaud the fact that they have raised the idea of unisex/all gender bathrooms instead of demanding that we keep single sex bathrooms but let basically everyone into either one. And I think we do need more unisex bathrooms (and disabled loos) particularly in new buildings but I would suggest that this plan would not work with the current bathroom configuration."

Thus they become ground zero for all influenza as they meet people from all over the world and exchange strains. These influenza strains cause panic, reinforcing the commercial interests of Bayer and co;  People buy lozenges that are clinically proven to do nothing People buy otc remedies that are clinically proven to do nothing People buy herbs and vitamins and shit Governments feel pressured into buying tamiflu, which is kept in a vault until it expires.

If no positive samples, then it's a matter of there being lots of cars that make someone go ""huh, wonder if something is going on"".

Also I wouldn't have expected much of a shift from a single policy and positioning statement after one week.

newzealand,3dvhkm,danduran,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for providing information. Nobody my age that i know has a landline. I wonder if this is generally true of my generation.

There's two outfits that survey landlines. One is Roy Morgan, which came middle of the pack in predicting the 2014 election, and the other is TV3/Reid Research, which came dead last."
newzealand,3dvhkm,MasterEk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"This confirms a general trend in relatively recent polling of small movements in polling, with National slightly down, Labour slightly up, and the Greens making significant gains. Last week’s Roy Morgan looks like an outlier on that trend.  This is the lowest result for National in a Colmar Brunton poll result since before the election, the highest result for Labour in any poll (CB again) since February 2014, and the highest result for the Greens in a poll since before the election.   For comparison, there is a marked similarity with polling results from 3 years ago, with the exceptions that NZF is well up on where it was, and ACT no longer rates at all. (The June/August Colmar Brunton polls showed National on 47/48, Labour on 33/32, Greens on 13/12, NZF on 2.2/2.5, ACT on 2.2/2.5)."
newzealand,3dvhkm,MasterEk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:34 2015 UTC,One New Colmar Brunton was the most accurate poll at the 2014 election.
newzealand,3dvhkm,Purgecakes,5,Mon Jul 20 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn’t put too much store on that. While Colmar Brunton was deemed the most accurate, the late polls in the last election were all unusually accurate. There was not much difference in poll results throughout September. I have my own opinions as to why the polling was unusually accurate, but they won’t mean much to anyone else.   Leading into the 2014 election, Colmar Brunton under-estimated National support, was bang-on with Labour, Conservatives  and NZF, and over-estimated the greens. For 2011, they under-estimated National, ACT, and NZF, but were pretty good for Labour and the Greens. 2008, they over-estimated National and the Greens, under-estimated ACT and NZF, and were about right with Labour.  If you go back further into the election cycle, the polling across the board was more variable. It’s impossible to verify whether these polls were accurate or not, because support varies considerably through the term, and there’s no proximate election to check them against. I like following them, and try to read something into them, but there is so much to happen.  The other polling agencies have a similar record. The only real trend in late polling is over-estimating Green support and under-estimating NZF.   In 2008, Roy Morgan was probably most accurate (but it missed the Greens considerably). In 2011 all the polls over-estimated National quite seriously, but were otherwise pretty uneven, missing one or more of the other parties by some margin.  All of that said, this makes the Roy Morgan look like an outlier."
newzealand,3dvhkm,MasterEk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"2011 had the weird aspect that everyone was so sure the Nats would win that it hurt turn out, even among Nat supporters. The polls were probably a victim of their own success.  Though, maybe the polls were just bad around that time."
newzealand,3dvhkm,slewratedotnet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that that is the story.   NZ polls traditionally have a conservative bias, as do polls internationally. 2011 was no exception to that. 2014 was the exception.   2014 was an extremely unusual campaign, and was marked by extreme uncertainty, especially on the left. I reckon there was a late swing at the end, which saw a lower turnout on the left, and/or a swing to National."
newzealand,3dwf06,camprice92,6,Mon Jul 20 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"Personal experience and that of my friends, is police are more likely to make you throw your weed in a drain or bin, tell you to stay at home if you want to smoke, and let you on your way. I've had a very smelly bag of weed in my jacket pocket when getting pulled up for no helmet on my bicycle, and despite him definitely smelling it(I smelt intensely of weed and had red eyes) he didn't even mention it.. or give me a ticket for that matter. They are pretty all good about it, most of the time."
newzealand,3dwf06,pppowernz,8,Mon Jul 20 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, the police are pretty good most of the time. The problem is that some of the time they aren't: if they don't like the look of you, or the colour of your skin, or if they are really intolerant of drugs, then they can choose to throw the book at you. That can ruin your life.  We need politicians to change the law, rather than leaving justice in the hands of the police."
newzealand,3dwf06,pppowernz,4,Mon Jul 20 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I agree,  but it's better than harsh police and laws that still aren't changing anyway."
newzealand,3dwf06,pppowernz,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:17 2015 UTC,"For sure - as I say in the feature the police should be commended for the policy, it's politicians that should be condemned for not entrenching it in law."
newzealand,3dwf06,pppowernz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the politicians in power aren't the ones who created the laws.. and they aren't changing then because of how much public support it remaining illegal. Sure, lots of younger people are for legalising, but far more of the less vocal but more abundant older generation want it kept illegal.. it's their fault really, they are the ones making it an issue that politicians don't want to attack."
newzealand,3dwf06,-halcyon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:38:04 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Over the next decade, as the older generation passes on and a younger one replaces it as the majority, there will definitely be a shift in public opinion.  I just think it's a pity that politician's are followers rather than leaders when it comes to these things."

newzealand,3dwf06,captaincrunchie,6,Mon Jul 20 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like to decriminalise marijuana, I would to see an expansion of mental health services first. I finished my mental health placement as a nursing student not so long ago, and I noticed quite a bit of our schizophrenic patients (like 95%) all smoked marijuana on a regular basis. There is a strong connection between schizophrenia and marijuana (excuse the Australian Government website, they do however cite the relevant research) so it's quite important that we have the infrastructure to support our drug users first before legalising a drug that's known to have a strong connection to schizophrenia."
newzealand,3dwf06,Butiprovedthem,4,Mon Jul 20 03:03:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. Treatment is the answer, not prison or a criminal conviction. In fact, when the Misuse of Drugs Act was passed in 1975 the select committee attached a rider saying that the law wouldn't work unless funding for mental health and addiction treatment was increased massively. It never was.  You should check out the Law Commission report's recommendations - it shows how we can transition from the criminal aproach to a treatment approach. We already have the infrastructure, we just need to grow it in tandem with decreasing the number of people prosecuted for cannabis."

newzealand,3dwf06,bittopia,6,Mon Jul 20 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It seems more likely that cannabis has the potential to exacerbate underlying schizophrenic tendencies than causing schizophrenia in otherwise healthy people. And even then, the research is patchy at best and needs to be strengthened.  But the link between cannabis and dependence/addiction is much more clear, and I think addiction treatment should be made more available."

Will I get schizo If I have 1 joint a week?  I highly doubt it.  People in my situation shouldn't be punished because others will over indulge.

newzealand,3dwf06,logantauranga,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"Did you even read what I wrote? Mental health services apply to everyone, including those suffering from anxiety from stress because of work and gasp those who have addiction/dependence problems which is relevant to those smoking MJ and consuming ETOH.  What are you trying to say exactly? People already get help for cirrhosis of the liver, it's called hospital and medications. Mental health problems which could be associated with MJ are much harder to treat and require a lot of resources, and one of our users in this subreddit already pointed out that our government doesn't actually put any funding towards mental health in a long time.   So before going on the ""420 blazeit/let's legalise it/fuck da police"" train, actually read what I wrote first. I'm all for legalising it, but only if mental health services are vastly expanded to meet future needs and potential cases related to the legalisation of MJ. Legalising MJ is a great excuse to put more money into mental health if you ask me."

Yes, I admit it is very difficult to visually tell the difference between a Kiwi with Chinese heritage speaking Mandarin versus someone living in mainland China.  Are we now having mobs attacking people at NZ home auctions who have an Asian appearance....or is this ""hating Chinese"" thing being slightly blown out of proportion?  I believe Kiwis are concerned about foreign investors, and Chinese are probably a significant portion thereof - but that doesn't mean anybody is hated."
newzealand,3dtlqg,Hubris2,3,Sun Jul 19 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's blown out of proportion because it allows the current ruling mob to continue to resist acknowledging that there is a crisis or doing anything about it."

newzealand,3dtlqg,ShittyProducer,4,Sun Jul 19 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't hate them. In fact I'd probably mistake a Chinese person for a Korean rather easily. But I work in central Auckland and Queen Street during any day is predominantly Asian. And increasingly so. What concerns me personally, is a never used to really notice it. I remember several tourists and Aus family members say it to me. But it never registered a couple years ago.  Now it does. And now I see the little things. However right or wrong I am. Things like how many struggle to adjust to NZ (or mainly western) social norms. Atrocious self-awareness and concept of personal space. Groups standing around blocking entire sidewalks. Spitting. And yes, being a house hunter in the past, what I've seen myself at auctions adds to a general feeling of... ""overrun""? I don't know the right word for it, and I'm sure whatever word I chose will sound bad.  All I know is I never used to notice Asians of any nationality any more than any other human. Now I do. And I know I'm not alone, considering it's a weekly conversation that I often don't start. Most definitely people I know I wouldn't dream of hearing racially focused comments is becoming more common place in Auckland. Hell, I was waiting for some friends at a bar before the AB's game and the group beside me were deep in conversation about exactly that. That's shit I've never seen in Auckland. And it sucks.  In that respect, I feel sorry for your Girlfriend and anyone who is legitimately here for a life. I've lived in other countries. I like others who chose to go through all the bullshit and paperwork to be able to call NZ home. That shit isn't easy.  But this thing, particularly in Auckland, needs to be nipped in the bud. Or things like this article will happen. The frustrating thing about that for me is the biggest solution to the whole racial edge of this mess is to simply start recording damn statistics to avoid the argument in the first place. If the non-resident ownership is proven to be as minor as the Govt ""knows"", people will need to accept another truth.  Instead the government is leaving it to the people to use their own eyes, ears, mouths and imagination, and see that precise official position as admission that they are indeed correct in their assumptions."

The government confirming the issue wouldn't even be a problem or bad reflection on them! there is either no problem or the issue is confirmed and dealt with -it's win win."

However any spider bite causes a hole in your skin and their fangs could have all sorts of bacteria on them, white tails spiders are happy to bite you and have largish fangs so I would say the chances are therefore increased.  I have seen the wounds from one of these bites and the guy saw the spider and felt the bite, and 4 months later he still had a nurse visiting him twice a week to change the dressings, the wound was horrific.  So I'll still be checking my underpants every morning before I put them on because I saw the size of his wound and I know the size of my...."

If you say, ""Do you need any help?"" and they say ""just looking"" then you lose an opportunity to tell them about deals or show off some of the products.  We got told to find something we like about their outfit and compliment it. This almost always gets a conversation going:  Me: ""I love your necklace!""  Them: ""Thank you, I got it from such and such""  Me: ""Oh I've always wanted to go in there and check out their stuff! Is it reasonably priced?""  Them: ""Blablabla""   Me: ""So are you looking for anything in particular today?""   Them: ""No thanks just having a look""   Me: ""Okay well just letting you know we have 50% off blabla over here, and this stuff here is new in today. Give me a shout out if you need help with anything"".  Because you've had that initial chat and they've warmed up to you, they're more likely to come see you if they do need help finding something.  Or if they're not just looking, they'll be more likely to say, ""I'm looking for a dress for a wedding"" and you can go from there and specify what they have in mind.   Another opener we were given was to talk to them about something going on in the city at the moment. ""Did you go see world of wearable arts / all blacks game / whatever?""  Another opener, when we were a new store, was ""Have you been to this store before? No? Just letting you know how our sizing works..."" (it was a plus size store).   TL;DR: Getting a conversation going makes them warm up to you and feel more comfortable asking you for help.

So ridiculous, I HATE when they lie - it usually makes me walk straight out (after getting back into my clothes)"
newzealand,3dsbvg,kochipoik,2,Sun Jul 19 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"No, not City Chic. Our customers were usually middle class, middle aged women. I would never lie with a compliment! If they didn't have nice shoes / bag / necklace / lipstick / outfit, I'd go with a different opener.   I get complimented on a particular red coat of mine every single time I wear it - whether by friends, coworkers, store assistants. I never feel like it's a fake compliment because the coat IS amazing. If they're complimenting holey sleeved cardigans they're doing it wrong."

newzealand,3dsbvg,tallulahblue,4,Sun Jul 19 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think a compliment is the best way. If someone says something like ""Did you go to the game?"" it feels so blatantly false and like something they've said to the last 50 people. And I end up more annoyed with them than if they'd said nothing."
newzealand,3dsbvg,americanpharoah,3,Sun Jul 19 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"I kind of see it like the weather - it's just to make conversation. Nobody actually enjoys talking about the weather, but what else are strangers going to talk about to warm up to each other? Sure, they might have said the All Blacks thing to everyone, but everyone is going to have a different answer.  You'll get one person say they are down for the weekend from Napier and catching up with friends, another person say they hate rugby being on because it's impossible to get a park...  there's more to go off than weather talk. I genuinely liked hearing what people were getting up to too. Some people just like to talk; I am one of those people. OP isn't, and that's fine.  I definitely notice when I get complimented by sales staff. I always think to myself, ""I wonder if they were trained to do that?"" but even being aware of it, I don't mind it and find myself chatting away about my coat or whatever. It's nice to be complimented and people often like to talk about where they got things."

newzealand,3dsbvg,keyo_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:12 2015 UTC,I admit I'm slightly more likely to buy if people pressure me like that... but I never want to go back to that shop.
newzealand,3dsbvg,tallulahblue,8,Sun Jul 19 03:34:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see how chatting about someone's necklace, asking if they were here for an event in town, or explaining how our sizing system works is ""pressure"".   It's not like I was holding things up and saying, ""you'd look great in this! Come with me now and try it on! Try these two while we're at it! And you need the cardigan too.""   We'd chat, they'd then either say they are looking for something in particular and I'd help them find it, or they'd say they just want to browse and I'd leave them to it and say I'm here if they need me. When they were in the changing room I'd pop back to ask if they needed me to grab another size or help them check the fit.   Just because you don't enjoy chatting, it doesn't mean nobody does. I found that most women enjoyed a bit of chat. I found it had the opposite effect of pressure - it took the pressure off and made them realise I was a normal, laid-back, friendly person who was going to be helpful if they needed it, not some pushy harpy.    I had customers say they really appreciated my help because I'd be honest with them and say things like, ""I'm going to be honest with you, that material is really clinging in the back.""   I love sales people like this - normal, chill, friendly, joke around a bit, and give honest opinions. I hate going into some clothing stores and feeling like I am not cool enough to be in there because the staff ignore you and chat to each other. It gives off a vibe (whether intended or not) that they assume you're not going to buy something or they think you aren't worth talking to."
newzealand,3dsbvg,mrmrevin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:28:18 2015 UTC,That's why the staff need to be taught to work out what kind of person they're talking to and give the person an opportunity to be left alone if that's what they want.

newzealand,3dsbvg,tallulahblue,2,Sun Jul 19 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"We do leave them alone if they say they are just browsing (see my examples above). But we are required to at least try talk to them when they come in, and to ask if they need sizing help once they are in the changing room. If they give one word answers to questions or seem generally uninterested in chatting it's not like we'd follow them around asking them about their day. If you get this... yeah I can see why that'd be annoying."
newzealand,3dsbvg,kochipoik,3,Sun Jul 19 04:44:03 2015 UTC,Oh don't even get me started on changing rooms. There's nothing more off-putting than those stores where the staff think it's ok to shout at me through a changing room door when I'm in my underwear.  How any manager considers that good customer service is beyond me.
newzealand,3dsbvg,kochipoik,4,Sun Jul 19 04:59:51 2015 UTC,Then you clearly don't like going to underwear stores.  I went to Bra's and Things in Melbourne and they were extremely helpful because she was checking up on me in the changing room.  But the topic is subjective.
newzealand,3dsbvg,kochipoik,2,Sun Jul 19 06:46:11 2015 UTC,"Managers think it is good customer service because a lot of customers think it's good customer service.   I hate when I'm standing there with the wrong size dress and I want to try a different size and I have to put all my clothes back on, head out into the shop, grab another size, and join the queue for the changing room again. SO much quicker if a sales assistant swings by and says ""How are you doing for sizing?"" and I say ""Could you grab me that dress in the next size up?"".   That's why they do it."

Woolworth owned us before that and we had lots of staff and we're quite friendly,  had time to do product knowledge sheets. With customers,  we'd say the standard hello as you walk in and that's that,  if you need help,  you'd generally give us a sign or a nod or something and I'll be right over. Under the new owners,  they are an equity firm,  so they wanted.... Well more equity. So they micromanaged us,  in terms of business,  it worked,  they payed off all of dicksmiths debt in one year and made the most out of all the retail chains including jb HiFi. In terms of everything else,  it was hell,  straight away we went down to 5 staff instead of ten,  HR department was dropped,  along with 2IC and 3IC. We had new impossible targets,  we had to have an item per docket imperative,  sales per hour,  warranties to sales percentage,  we were monitored like crazy, had to speak to a customers within 60 seconds of them entering the store. We learnt psychology to understand what the customer ""really""  wanted,  we called warranties ""protection plans"" because warranty has a social stigma attached to it.  Every month someone was on the brink of loosing their job.   I dont know about the clothing side if retail but electronics has gotten rediculous,  all they guys in suits want is money and don't care for knowledgeable staff, they only want sales. And that was the death of Dicksmith. We took pride in selling the customer what they needed, and had a good loyal customer base before these priks came in and butched dickies.   So... I dont know where I was going with that. At the end of the day,  it's not the salesmans fault,  it management wanting to siphon as much money off of the consumer as possible. And forcing the salesman to act that way."

I haven't encountered much of what you're talking about in NZ but just sounds like they're doing their job, and I know for a fact that them engaging with you and suggesting clothes to buy that suit you and go with your other items will definitely get people to buy more.   And in Asia the shop ppl sometimes follow you around the shop it's creepy and very off putting. But they do it because they want to be right next to you when you need something, and I hate it and will leave the shop very quickly. If only they just said hello and asked how my day was!"

But honestly, it sounds like you are a more antisocial type  and that any stranger enquirying how your day is would offend you (bluntly saying) . I suggest you ignore there question, and state what you are after. Being direct they will only give you the answers you want and a quicker sale. If you are just looking, say I am just looking, and will ask you if i need any help.

If I really was having a shitty day I wouldn't want to tell some stranger about it. If my day was grand I wouldn't necessarily want to share the reasons why with a stranger either.  Why is a quicker sale better? If you give me time to look around I'll probably buy more stuff and I'll probably come back because I feel comfortable in your shop.   The majority of buyers feel that this sale training makes them feel the seller is more genuine and caring about their interests.

I respond, ""Yeah, Sleepy, Dopey and Grumpy"". Usually gets a laugh.  I think you're experiencing staff on commission and very poorly trained. Hunger makes them silly."
newzealand,3dsbvg,rinmic,3,Sun Jul 19 02:14:00 2015 UTC,"Used to work retail for a few years while at uni, here to lay down the deal! The intensive talking stuff is a way to make customers feel more comfortable asking you questions and is meant to help the staff member gauge what they might like to buy in the store.   From what I can remember, a lot of the format of the questioning was designed from marketing and psychological studies about what people respond best to in a retail environment. It was always stressed that each interaction needed to feel genuine and unique, otherwise the chatting would feel hollow and forced. The problem is that not many people are good at having repetitive conversations with strangers and changing up the format.   It's really easy to tell which customers don't want to talk, but we had to do those beginning ""how's your day going"" chats to make sure all the customers felt comfortable asking staff for help. You'd be surprised how many people warm to it. In all the stores I worked in, we had regulars who would come in on an almost weekly basis to buy a tonne of stuff and chat for hours with the staff."
newzealand,3dsbvg,rinmic,3,Sun Jul 19 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. When I moved to NZ from the UK I encountered this same 'problem'.  Really, if you're like me and are awkward making small talk with sales assistants, whatever they say/ask just respond with ""Just looking at the moment."" and give them a smile. They won't bother you any further.  This response works pretty much whatever they ask."

newzealand,3dsbvg,cornbread_curfew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:36:05 2015 UTC,"Conversely, there are loads of people who are the exact opposite of you. They want help, but won't ask for it, so it is up to sales staff to provide sufficient warmth to make the customer comfortable enough to divulge their needs. I've been in a niche retail environment for nearly 30 years and you, I'm afraid, are in a significant minority."
newzealand,3dsbvg,couchmonster,2,Sun Jul 19 10:16:58 2015 UTC,"Two things:  First, have you considered that people like me appear to be in a minority because aggressive ""customer service"" puts us off?  I shop for clothes about once every six months. If it weren't for the overly aggressive staff I'd probably go clothes shopping every other week. That means you can multiply the number of people like me that you actually see in your shop by 13 to get the actual number of potential customers you're missing out on.  Second, I wonder whether you can mistake ""providing sufficient warmth"" for ""bullying someone into making a purchase"".  I've fallen into the trap of trying to explain what I'm looking for to ""friendly"" staff who jumped on me when I walked through the door. They've even managed to get me to make a purchase, perhaps buy more than I would have bought otherwise. They probably thought that they did a great job and that they helped me. I tried to be friendly back, so I probably looked satisfied. The reality is that I was just being polite. I left feeling bullied and pushed around the entire time. I hated the experience and vowed never to go back.  I don't doubt that there are people who need help out of their shell, but a lot of people like their shells. They like to do things in their own time, their own way, they have plenty of things they want to consider before making a purchase and they're not coming back if you bully them into making a purchase they later regret.  I apologise if this reply seems a little accusatory. I'm sure you're not one of the bad ones. It's just that I anticipated some of your explanations and I think that it they rest on some dodgy assumptions that I'm really keen to highlight."
newzealand,3dsbvg,ElectronicFlesh,0,Sun Jul 19 11:03:12 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I don't sell clothes. Secondly, you are letting the actions of others affect your functioning. I too, buy clothes and frequently have the same experience as you. No, I'm not going to tell some 19 girl what my plans are for the weekend nor am I going to shop at places like Glassons and Hallenstines that these sale staff frequent. My staff say words to the effect of ""Hello...how are you today?"" The response to that question tells you exactly how the remainder of the experience will go.    Ultimately, you're having your experience changed by external factors that are actually beyond your control. So you are right...don't shop there, or alternatively, do what the rest of us do and politely ignore them and go about your business."
newzealand,3dsbvg,Pete_Venkman,2,Sun Jul 19 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"If they're being rude in your opinion, get what you can out of the relationship - networking, deals, information that you'll later use for online purchases. You don't have to put up with rudeness.  If they're being genuine (like they don't upsell at you or manipulate you to buy at this store/a store owned by the same people) then treat them like a normal person."
newzealand,3dsbvg,SCombinator,-6,Sun Jul 19 00:26:39 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with their approach is that they don't give you a way out of the conversation without having to be rude myself.

newzealand,3dsbvg,Cutezacoatl,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:21 2015 UTC,"I work clothing retail, in small family owned store.  It's not about foreigners in my opinion.  In our store, it's the general decline of bricks & mortar stores in favour of internet shopping that has the boss sweating. We have always marketed ourselves as the friendly, honest and helpful local shop that is active in the community. It worked for the last 70 years, but we're beginning to see many of our premium brands (high quality footwear, outerwear, knitwear) being sold online by the manufacturer or other retailers at lower prices. I see quite a few people who ask me to write down their size and the style number of a garment on our business card, and it never comes to anything. I'm not saying all of them are going online and buying, but it must be happening some of the time.   So we (retail workers) are told to try and get you to buy when you're here. We engage with you to try and pass on extra information about our products, or to try and build a relationship that will mean you'll trust us to help you with co-ordinating outfits or helping with gift buying. Not everyone wants this help, so our policy is to greet you, check if you're happy to browse (at this point I am gauging your reaction to see if you want to be engaged with, if not I give you space, and get on with my tasks) and make you aware we are free to help you (or if we aren't, make sure you know that someone is there to help) if you need it.   Often I'm bored of re-folding and hanging hundreds of garments, and just want to chat. I don't get a commission, my sign advertises my point of difference to be 'friendship' and we have been part of the community for generations, so I was hired to be a cheerful, honest (no, not every piece of clothing you try on looks good on you, and it's cruel to not give constructive feedback when asked).   It works. We have a little community of regulars who know our staff and owners well, people trust us to source items for them or help them choose gifts, and we do our best to make up for our higher prices with a superior customer experience. We're staying afloat and doing okay, but working on this side of the counter has put me off trying to get everything at the lowest price online."
newzealand,3dsbvg,kkdd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're doing it right. Letting people be happy to browse allows people like me to feel comfortable in your shop.

If National got a fourth term, I could certainly see them bolstered enough to axe things like interest-free student loans, Working for Families, remove the government top-up to KiwiSaver, etc. They'd leave a generation in the lurch to pander to aging farmers.

They would far rather people saved their own money for their retirement rather than have to have the state totally funding it via the pension.

newzealand,3dt569,Swaga_Dagger,-6,Mon Jul 20 03:42:08 2015 UTC,Jobseeker and supported living assistance are different benefits.  If NZ doctors say your mum is fit to work but she chooses not to and is denied jobseekers that is fine in my books.  Edit: we discussed and it turns out you mother can't get med cert for injury/sickness. What you want if welfare for anyone that chooses it over work. I think that is both irresponsible and beyond NZ resources.   You mother didn't not qualify because her job was willing to wait. That fact does not prevent someone from getting jobseeker.

Instead, it wanted to tax people who had done well and made themselves wealthy through hard work, so that it could help the worst off and those on welfare, ignoring those in the middle.

What's weird is that I ended back at the very same company in a different department, have been promoted, but still am unable to transfer to a better paying department due to my past 6 years ago. Rule number one with employment is leave your dignity at the door and even if your employer outright lies to you, just agree."
newzealand,3dt6zt,Mojocrunch,3,Sun Jul 19 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"If the clause is in the employment agreement then yes it will generally be enforceable. Many employment contracts will have a clause regarding how much notice an employer requires for a resignation. If insufficient notice the employer can withhold unpaid wages if this is a penalty described in the employment agreement.   However I have never heard of a clause where the employee is liable  for more than unpaid wages. However it is possible that if such a clause is in the agreement that the employer could go to the Employment Relations Authority to get them to impose the penalty.  If your friend wants someone to read over the contract for them and explain what they could potentially be liable for she should contact her local Community Law Center and ask for an appointment, they can give some advice based on the actual contract in question."
newzealand,3dt6zt,gameking234,2,Sun Jul 19 05:58:09 2015 UTC,Many companies will put employees on garden leave after resignation anyway so notice doesn't always mean you're still there pretending to work.

newzealand,3dt6zt,KnG_Kong,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"There is case law around this.  I forget which one, but basically the employee left the job and didn't work out their notice period, the employer took them to court and successfully managed to get the equivalent wages of the notice period from the employee.  It works both ways however - if you have a 4 week notice period and the employer tells you to fuck off, you could, in theory, get 4 weeks' wages off them."

Not exactly common, but not uncommon either.  Its usually a payment equivalent to the wages she would have been paid. i.e you leave within 3 weeks instead of 4, then she'd have to pay 1 weeks worth of wages as penalty.  Whether a company enforces this is another story."
newzealand,3dt6zt,afunky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:04:53 2015 UTC,"Usually companies that pay you monthly will require a months notice. Most other companies require 2 weeks. The company I work for says 1 week notice in the contract, but upon giving one week you will be threatened with being fired and demand 2 weeks, and if you give two weeks straight away they will often demand a month. Completely illegal, however the only time i would recommend fighting it is if you have already signed a contract for another job."
newzealand,3dt6zt,Mojocrunch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"The law says ""reasonable notice"" - In highly skilled/hard to fill positions, it's pretty common to have one month notice requirement.   Payment to the employer seems a bit weird and is probably unenforceable based on my understanding of the law. That said, most employment disputes end up in mediation instead of court - so if it was a fair provision based on the specific job and circumstances it might hold up. I can certainly see this holding up for a contract engagement rather than direct employer/employee relationship."

With a time frame of six months to build a complex professional website, $150K is one person's wages and costs barely. It would take a lot more than one person, even if one person existed with multiple skills sets. Your average competent network engineer is not also a skilled graphic designer."

I'd feel pretty uncomfortable trying to squeeze a rework of rnz into that range.  Completely unrelated: their existing site is shit quick.

Probably to aid discoverability (something like npr.org). At the moment their website looks kind of like a 'poor-man's' herald or stuff. Heaps of focus currently on written articles.

Why spend so much money where 150k-500k is a drop in the bucket/reasonable, when there are other software that comes at a fraction of a price and comes with more features than the custom made website would? For example vBulletin or other forum software. Someone who is IT savvy but not a specialist could set it up, and mod it so it's less of a forum but a news/blog site. Some of the biggest websites in the woeld with huge amount of traffic have used it for many years. How much traffic could radionz possibly have? few thousand per day? And how much will it cost to maintain the custom software? Having a minor new feature added, would cost thousands."
newzealand,3dr70x,kkdd,3,Sat Jul 18 22:47:08 2015 UTC,"There a number of things to consider here:   Content editing - The people loading content probably aren't going to be technical.  They need a reasonably nice front end to load content which is where the paid CMS products focus their energy Workflows - A serious news site needs publishing workflows.  Ie. content is written then approved by an editor.  They may need to send the content back with comments etc.  If you're publishing many articles per day then this is a big deal Hosting and security - News sites are targeted by hacking/ddos attacks all the time (eg. when they write stories about ISIS).  Services like Akamai help, but you still need a lot of care to make things work right   There are many other considerations, but these are some of the big ones.  Having said that, it looks like RNZ have an existing CMS and hosting solution, and they just want new css etc.  Then 150k is fine. a small design agency could do something nice for that. https://www.gets.govt.nz/RNZ/ExternalTenderDetails.htm?id=13787253"

newzealand,3dssoc,Sataz,6,Sun Jul 19 02:49:41 2015 UTC,This is a great summary to read through and it breaks it down into different spending levels too.
newzealand,3dssoc,headbean,4,Sun Jul 19 02:58:17 2015 UTC,"I picked up the Kiwibank platinum card during a (now defunct) deal which involved no annual fee for the first year and 125 free airpoints after meeting a small spending requirement ($500 in three months I believe). I intend to cancel it before the first year is up and look for similar deals/bonuses from other banks.  I also have the Amex no fee airpoints card, and got something like 50 free airpoints for meeting a small spending requirement.  Unlike the US, there isn't a whole lot of competition in the NZ credit card market, so there aren't huge value propositions out there. Also since we're limited to Air NZ airpoints, which are a simple dollar towards airfare rather than an actual points scheme, there isn't so much the opportunity for gaming the system.  I definitely recommend jumping on a no annual fee for the first year + bonus airpoints deal if you can. I believe Amex has one at the moment for their platinum Airpoints card. The only downside is Amex not being accepted everywhere."
newzealand,3dssoc,choc_milk,4,Sun Jul 19 03:33:42 2015 UTC,ALWAYS ask if they'll waive the annual fee.  I've had ASB Platinum for a couple of years without any fee.  I've never had anyone not waive the fee when I've asked.
newzealand,3dssoc,TouchMyselfAtNight,2,Sun Jul 19 05:40:45 2015 UTC,You can do that?! Dammit
newzealand,3dssoc,NickRivieraPhD,3,Sun Jul 19 07:53:36 2015 UTC,Yea I did that when I was setting up my student account with Kiwibank. I had signed up for it and said I wanted to talk with someone before I formally sign for it. They called me and I said I wanted to change a few things. I told them the things I wanted or I dont want the pack they said they'd have to check if they could with their higher ups - a couple days later I got the letter confirming the opening of my tertiary pack and all the terms attached I wanted were in my favour
newzealand,3dssoc,KiwiKibbles,3,Sun Jul 19 09:35:00 2015 UTC,"Some cards give sign up bonuses (often around $AP200) which make it a better deal.  If you change cards every year or two you can continually pick up these bonuses.  Also if you travel, then getting a gold/platinum card can give you free travel insurance.  AMEX cards often give a better return, but then they are not as widely accepted as Visa/Mastercard.  But your initial analysis is right - you need to spend a lot to make the reward schemes worthwhile."

Looking at the points she had, though, helped her answer where her money went too.  Anyway, IMHO, look at fees, and, if you're planning running an overdraft, interest & all that jazz. Treat the points as a bonus once you've covered the bases."

Each of those cards give you 200 airpoints advance, and at the moment anz platinum has a promo where you spend $1000 in first 3 months you get 200 airpoints. Didn't see the free 125 points bonus with kiwibank that choc_milk mentioned, and the downside to kiwibank is when you want to contact them via phone, it's a hell of a wait unlike anz."

NZ is awesome but the places you'll find a job are more likely to be less awesome.  Auckland and Wellington are the main business areas - there's decent opportunities going at the moment but there's no the same beautiful scenery that you might expect.  If I were you I'd look in Queenstown.  It's starting to develop as a bit of a business hub and you've got access to some of the best parts of the country.   I'm planning on looking for an entry level management job.    Management job straight out of university might be a bit difficult.  What sort of industry were you looking for?  What skills do you have?   I'm wondering what the job market is like over there and I figured I'd ask!   Depends on the industry but generally pretty good.  Business outlook is generally pretty positive and most big firms are hiring these days.

Back when I was a kid, I had a friend (few years younger) who lived near our place (this being good old NZ, the fastest way between our places was a trip through the bush, across a small creek and across a collapsed number-eight-wire fence). We spent a fair bit of time together, playing video games and roaming around outside. Eventually his family moved elsewhere and we lost contact.  Fast forward a few years, and he's just transferred to the same high school and is in the same form class (multi-year class). Good times were had. I still remember what he wrote on my 7th form leaving card: ""good luck at uni and come out on top. On top of some girls, that is"".  Fast forward another few years and I run into him in what turned out to be my last year of uni study (having decided to finish off with a graduate diploma in computer science). We actually did two papers together that year. We talked, shared stories, that sort of thing.  Fast forward another couple of years and I get a call from my parents, who are still living in that same house in the bush avec petit stream. A young man they didn't recognise had knocked on their door and introduced himself as a friend of mine who used to live nearby, hoping to get back in touch. He'd been diagnosed with cancer and was visiting the neighbourhood to, I guess, get back in touch with the past. They gave him my phone number and email so he could get in touch, and he gave them his number in return. Sadly, we never did manage to catch up - I tried to call and sent a few text messages and emails to old addresses I had, but didn't get a response. I figured he was trying to deal with his situation and didn't follow through further - couldn't find his social media details.  I'm reminded of this story, because today is his birthday. Wherever you are, my friend, keep fighting the good fight."

It's neither.   It's an economic problem. It's unavoidable that there's going to be other races and cultures contained in the information surrounding the matter but it can be discussed without xenophobic or racist slurs. It just takes maturity and the ability to draw fine points in the argument.   This is a vital issue with massive ramifications that will echo through decades. It is absolutely the role of government to regulate foreign ownership and there must be some proper public discourse.   Otherwise we'll all pay, and so will our descendants."

newzealand,3drk75,HerbertMcSherbert,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:53:31 2015 UTC,"I think you're misdiagnosing the problem.  Land shouldn't be available as a speculative investment vehicle to anyone, whether they're a resident of the country or not. You should earn money from how you use land not from passively owning it.  An 100% capital gains tax on land would solve this problem and create a huge new revenue stream, allowing us to reduce other taxes without the negative side effects that most taxes have."

Otherwise no one could afford to sell land after buying it.   It's an interesting potential solution though, yeah. If your property can only go up in value at the inflation rate (or a set nominal inflation rate, e.g. 3%) that would free up capital into other more productive investments.   Trying to think it through...I guess you could still do long-term buy and hold rental investments so long as you get sufficient yield."
newzealand,3drk75,HerbertMcSherbert,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely real capital gains after inflation. Land taxes are generally considered one of the most efficient taxes because land is in fixed supply so you don't distort production.  There are obviously plenty of technical considerations but the general idea is that we need to start taxing capital gains on land."
newzealand,3drk75,courtenayplacedrinks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:08 2015 UTC,So...hmm...it would stop prices rising due to speculation and investment for capital gains...but would it stop it where the cause is anything else?
newzealand,3drk75,HerbertMcSherbert,3,Sun Jul 19 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"There is a fixed amount of land so ""supply"" does not affect land prices. Prices are solely affected by demand for land; as long as the economy and population grows land prices will increase.  That's not a bad thing; it just creates an incentive to use land productively. If no one can just make money by holding land then wealthy people will big sections will subdivide to provide more, denser housing which will make our cities more sustainable and bring rents down.  Those same wealthy people who can no longer make money from property investment will instead invest money in businesses and grow the economy."

Whether this deliberately invoked racism or casually looked the other way while it happened, it was still a cheap shot.  But nothing else Vance said stacked up. Cities around the world are identifying that foreign investors are driving up property values, and they are right. In the cities she named, where they register foreign buyers, they are driving up prices.   Labour have also talked extensively about the supply side. Suggesting they aren't is just plain wrong."

newzealand,3drk75,SCombinator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"It might have been that Labour looked at this and thought:   The Chinese community overwhelmingly votes conservative (Conservatives/ACT/National), and there is no changing that, so alienating the Chinese vote isn't a big worry. There are a number (Chinese and otherwise) on the left who will be up in arms about this, but they are the Green constituency anyway. Seriously: does anyone believe that Keith Ng doesn't vote for the Greens?   So there wasn't much to lose, aside from being on the side of good. So, in the interests of political expediency, they might have overlooked the racist impact of their strategy. They kicked a hornets' nest, hoping that lots of the centre will lap up their audible concern about foreign buyers. One question is whether:   Labour viewed the likely racist backlash as an unfortunate side-effect, or Labour saw it as a useful side-effect, contributing to their movement away from being seen as PC, appealing to racist voters, and increasing the news impact of the story.   Neither is good."

newzealand,3drk75,MasterEk,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that they have previously been involved in that debate. They could (and should) have continued to build on that, to press the current government for data and raise other issues. But instead they took this 'cheap' route and have done themselves (and the public) a great disservice by obscuring the real debate.  It should have been obvious that releasing half-baked data, which singles out Chinese people, was going to end up causing a race debate.   So now instead of an intelligent, meaningful discussion on the multitude of issues that are causing the housing crisis we have a single focus on foreign investment (or more accurately - Chinese investment)."
newzealand,3drk75,badcurry,2,Sat Jul 18 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"I don't support what they did--it was 'a cheap shot', as Vance called it, or dog-whistle politics. I understand the motives for it, but that doesn't excuse it.   There is a general consensus that foreign resident buyers--foreign investment--is helping to drive up prices in Auckland. The government has been denying that there is evidence for that, and refusing to gather that evidence. Labour gathered what evidence it could.  I've been disappointed with the calibre of debate generally. Labour conducted a cheap shot, because they know that racist attacks on Chinese would be a side-effect. (I haven't seen those racist attacks, but that doesn't mean they aren't happening.) But the critics of Labour's move have (equally knowingly, in some cases) dismissed the data on spurious grounds.  The data is not half-baked; the conclusions that can be drawn from it are, however, limited. All that was confirmed was that ethnically Chinese buyers are buying 4x as many houses in Auckland as they are a portion of the population. Along other factors (income data for Chinese NZers, for instance, shows that they have lower median incomes than the general population, comparisons with similar cities internationally, etc.), this data supported other evidence that foreign buyers are driving up property values."

As I recall, your nontherapeutic/infant cutting rate is around 1% in NZ. Respecting your children's right to make their own choices about their bodies (with the obvious exception for therapeutic need) is treating boys the same as girls—in a good way. I was basically trying to say that I think it's nice that you don't impose nontherapeutic genital modifications on children there. Sorry if I was too sarcastic for that to be unclear.  Because I have a few points about this issue that involve your region, here's a NZ pathologist describing the histology of the penis and foreskin:    Ken McGrath: Anatomy of the Penis: Penile and Foreskin Neurology. 16 min.    In Australia, Bensley & Boyle (2001) surveyed partners of men with intact and circumcised penises who were college students finding: ""Circumcised partners more often resorted to unsafe sexual practices; they were significantly more likely to engage in anal intercourse (p < .05), and significantly more reluctant to use condoms (p < .05)."" This NZ prostitute wrote that the only men she encountered who had asked if they might be able to pay more for sex without a condom (with a prostitute) had circumcised penises, which she considered a strong point against it being performed on children nontherapeutically (Johnson, 2012). This is the same in Zambia, where Abbott (2013) found that the majority of female sex workers told them that men with circumcised penises had used their circumcision status to try to talk them out of using a condom. This is more relevant than it would be if circumcision activists did not routinely promote infant penis cutting as if it were a public health measure.  Fortunately Oceanic doctors don't support nontherapeutic circumcision. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians Circumcision RACP Position Statement 2010 states:   The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis.  The foreskin requires no special care during infancy. It should be left alone. Attempts to forcibly retract it are painful, often injure the foreskin, and can lead to scarring and phimosis.   When considering routine infant circumcision, ethical concerns have focused on recognition of the functional role of the foreskin, the non-therapeutic nature of the operation, and the psychological distress felt by some adult males circumcised as infants. The possibility that routine circumcision contravenes human rights has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor for non-clinical reasons, and... without net clinical benefit for the child.   A 2012 online survey of Australian doctors found 74% believe newborn circumcision should not be offered to parents and 51% consider it ""tantamount to child abuse."""

Most cats in nz aren't chipped but it's always worth checking. If you are ok with feeding it in the meantime you should have enough time to rehome it before the end of the year if an owner doesn't come forward. A spade through the head is not a humane way of dealing with the situation and whoever suggested it needs their head checked. Walk in to your local vet clinic and discuss the situation with them. The nurses/reception staff should be able to point you in the right direction. :)

I eat bacon sometimes but not more than a couple times a month. Only recently got back into being able to eat eggs (because reasons), so don't eat those much either.

You're probably thinking that it doesn't sound very filling, but if you stick a bit of protein or oats into them then they'll fill you up and keep you full for hours.  Another favourite, although not as cheap as eggs/meat/bacon that you're tired of, is a sort of mini-platter. Here's one of my gotos. Now obviously you wouldn't be eating the bread on this plate, but add in some extra olives, a wedge of cucumber, an extra slice of cheese and a handful of baby spinach leaves and you have an awesome breakfast which will again keep you full for hours, and doesn't even need the meat if you're not into it. On top of all that, you can put a plate like that together in the time it takes you to brew your coffee. If it's not giving you enough calories, drizzle some extra virgin olive oil in top of the tomatoes and whatever leaves you're using and then put a bit of black pepper on them and that'll give you an extra 100 calories or so and probably keep you full till lunch."

Some mornings I skip breakfast and have a bulletproof style coffee instead.  It's nutritionally next-to-useless, but what it does do is satiates your hunger like nobody's business.  Often I'll hit 2 or 3pm before feeling hungry.  Now you shouldn't slam these down every morning because you can over-do things and send your cholesterol in the wrong direction, and as I said, they're nutritionally bereft of useful vitamins and minerals.  Whether a bulletproof style coffee is appropriate for a type-2 diabetic is a question for a professional though, hence the recommendation at the start of this post.  I also try to incorporate Avocado into my diet as a fat source.  And that presents some breakfast options.  You can bake an egg in an avocado, for example.  My results: cholesterol levels went from pre-diabetic to godlike, lost about 25kg.  Only changed my diet.  I've fallen slightly off the wagon recently because money's tight and carbs are cheap."

newzealand,3dpihg,round_7,3,Sat Jul 18 06:38:13 2015 UTC,"Paper bio-degrades a millennium faster than plastic.   Natural (aerobic) decomposition is good for paper, however the decomposition process that takes place in traditional landfills is anaerobic (namely done by bacteria) and this produces methane, a much worse type of greenhouse gas than CO2. In this case, you really shouldn't be concerned about the speed.  However, good modern landfills are designed in such a way that, contrary to popular belief, things should not decompose as this will prevent the release of greenhouse gases and other pollutions into soil, water or air. In this case, paper bags don't degrade much faster if at all than plastic.   Last I checked there weren't any renewable oil sources to make plastic.   Petroleum? In papermaking it accounts for 29% in terms of energy, second to only wood at 33% (sources in link below). Papermaking isn't just about cutting down some very expendable trees. There are also a lot of chemicals that gets released into the water and air during this process.  If you haven't heard about it already, I suggest you have a look at some life-cycle assessments (2 links there). It helps people avoid getting sucked into focusing too much on trendy terms like ""carbon footprint"" and instead takes into account of the resource used and waste produced directly or indirectly in all stages of a product's life. For example: paper is much more massive and heavier. Transporting (which is often overlooked when it comes to sustainability judgements for most people) it would be more costly both in the monetary sense and environmental sense.   I'd rather pay 10c or more for a plastic bag or get a paper bag for free. Literally the only reason some supermarkets (a.k.a. Pak N Save) charge for bags is environmental concerns, and it'd be good to see paper bags in more widespread usage.   In addition to environmental concerns around paper bags that would be an extremely shitty business decision. Paper bags cost a magnitude more to produce than plastic bags.  Look, I'm all for the eradication of plastic bags. But let's not make the mistake of being overzealous about getting away from plastic and ending up with something that will only take us further from our original objectives."

newzealand,3dpihg,EastenNinja,2,Sat Jul 18 07:20:30 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you on the fact that paper bags do not have the same re-usage potential that plastic does, especially when exposed to damp conditions.  However, paper's effect on the environment is only really at the manufacturing stage (through pulping and subsequent discharge of waste products), and if produced properly, efficiently and cleanly said effect is minimal. Once released into the environment, paper degrades fast.  At least in the North Island most pulping is done with geothermal energy as opposed to natural gas used elsewhere in the world where geothermal isn't available."

While I'm sure your brother is a perfect saint, it is pretty easy to imagine what it sounds like when she tells it:   We were all having a good time, a few drinks whatever. Fight ensued with bro and his ex, she left (against his wishes   becomes   He was drunk and abusive and wouldn't let me leave, so I had to run away when he was distracted for my own safety and the safety of our child.   Later in the story   Brother sat in car and stopped her from leaving in an attempt to find out where baby was. She called cops. Brother got served with some kind of protection order or something until this coming Monday.   I don't even need to really re-write this one - it is pretty bad on its own, but it becomes:   He stalked me then physically prevented me from leaving by blocking me in and I had to get the cops to get a protection order.   I'm not even convinced that her side of the story is that far fetched.  Tell your brother to:   Stop drinking. He can't afford to get caught up in another situation when he's been drinking and something happens with her. It is just not worth it - tell him to go sober for the next three months til this is sorted. Stay away from her. Don't call, don't go to the place she is staying. Don't sit in a car and block her from leaving. Get a lawyer and do what they say.   Edit: a few aspects of this story seem strange.

Hopfully he's finding a job (he left his a few weeks ago - They would of been fine for a few weeks until he found a new job - then they split up). He promised he'd get his act together on the following Wednesday. I guess I've been a slack sister in not calling to check up on him."

newzealand,3dq93b,MyPacman,2,Sat Jul 18 23:36:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying. I just want to say that brother was preventing her from leaving because she was drunk. Two bottles of wine. They were still together at that point. 3 hours later he went looking for her (he had a friend come over with a car) and found her at his best friends house. In a compromising position.   The baby was left home with me. She didn't take the child. Not until further that day wheb my brother didn't want to displace me because I really had nowhere else to go. She decided to leave (he didn't kick her out. We had organized temporary accommodation for me with either my nana or his friend should she decide to not leave  -  perhaps I should of put this in the original post.   I think its unfair the police will side with her. She drove drunk that night. She scratched his neck and was doing the whole girly hitting thing they sometimes do. I have pictures of the scratches that I know were not there the night before. How can they say she was in danger.   As for the blocking her from leaving. This happened yesterday (the actual event happens.... 2 weeks ago?). The baby was not present. All my brother wanted to know was where his child was. Which I think he has a right to know.

Will that stand if this goes to court? Surely actualy physical abuse is different from simply sitting in a car preventingher from leaving? I suppose that's something a lawyer can answer.  Thanks for all your posts. I really appreicate it."
newzealand,3dq93b,nightmarebrunette,3,Sun Jul 19 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"But I have pictures of the scratches she put on him. Will that stand if this goes to court?    Possibly - but they would have had more weight if he called the police and reported it when it happened. It is easy for her to claim that she was just protecting herself from him, and there is no proof either way.  The only official proof that exists so far, is your brother received a protection order from the police after physically restraining her from leaving.    I suppose that's something a lawyer can answer.   Winner winner."
newzealand,3dq93b,pevaryl,5,Sun Jul 19 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"He is already behind, because he didn't call the police when she took the baby the first time, she is using the law more effectively than he is.    It is my conjecture that: He will lose access to his kid if he doesn't fight for full custody and guardianship.  If he can't prove he is the main caregiver, he needs to prove he is fully involved.  He needs a lawyer, fast.  He also needs to learn the system, fast.  If he wants enough access to maintain and grow his relationship with his kid, he really does need daily (its a baby right?) contact, and he has to prove its in his kids best interests, he can't badmouth the mother (courts don't like that) unless it relates to the childs safety.  And for gods sake, his lawyer needs to make sure he doesn't agree to anything he doesn't like, the court can't impose custody agreements on you, you have to agree to them.  But you can't look stubborn for the sake of it, you have to have a valid safety concern.  tl;dr - learn the system, fast.  get a lawyer, fast."
newzealand,3dq93b,MyPacman,3,Sat Jul 18 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"Before a Family Court can act, your brother needs to show he's trying to figure things out with his ex on civil terms... There are good family mediation services available to facilitate this (around $800, but heavily subsidised if you're eligible for legal aid). He also needs to attend one of the Family Court 'working thru separation' workshops - family court requires this before they step in. Ultimately your brother needs to get his head around the idea the BEST people to make a decision for the child are him and his ex. Family court hands down a one off decision, but the parents have to live with that forever... And if it's unsatisfactory for either party you can bet in the long run their child will suffer. I know mediation sounds like a soft option, but you either come out with it with an interim parenting plan that both parents agree on, or the mediator writes to the court saying 'look we've done our best but we need you to intervene'. Family court is a pretty blunt instrument... Your brother needs to do everything he can to find the middle ground.   In the interim, he might suggest that a family member who knows the child might be able to visit or meet the mum and child somewhere neutral, make sure it's safe and well, take some toys/books and remind the child it's dad loves it and just needs a wee bit of time to sort things out with mum. That doesn't create confrontation between the parents and is in the best interests of the child. Plus it gives your brother some indication that his child is okay."
newzealand,3dq93b,pevaryl,4,Sat Jul 18 20:08:31 2015 UTC,OP do not advise a family member to contact the ex on his behalf THIS IS A BREACH OF THE PROTECTION ORDER and is a criminal offence  See a lawyer! You are not getting good advice here   Usually mediation is the best way to sort things - but the active protection order changes the context significantly and you need to tread very carefully.
newzealand,3dq93b,pevaryl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"Don't confuse a police safety order with a protection order. They are very different things - OP says the order ends on Monday meaning it isn't a protection order, but a temporary measure employed 'on the spot' by police to diffuse a situation. They last up to five days. I stand by my advice that another person (family member) might be able to start a constructive dialog with the brothers ex about the wellbeing of the child... Clearly neither OP's brother nor his ex are in a position to put everything else aside to work together in their child's best interests at the moment. The PSO doesn't prohibit someone saying 'hey, sounds like things aren't going great at the moment... Just wanted to check in and make sure (child) is doing okay?'"
newzealand,3dq93b,pevaryl,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:26 2015 UTC,"Oops, my mistake - I didn't see the five day limit. Although I still note that the same contact rules apply.

Although I think too many men lose their cases because they don't understand the weapons that are used against them, like restraining orders.  And they don't know how to combat that.  On the one hand, he has to mediate in good faith and do what's best for his kid.  But on the other hand, he has to see and understand the bullshit moves his ex is playing, and limit their effect."

newzealand,3dq93b,MyPacman,2,Sat Jul 18 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He needs a lawyer ASAP.   Will just point out - as the babies dad he is automatically a guardian; the police would not do anything if he called them the first time as she cannot kidnap her own baby; and that the court can (and very often does) impose custody arrangements on people. Thats why its best to try and get agreement - otherwise you end up with the courts deciding and both lose out. However any negotiations must be done through lawyers, because to contact her without her consent is an automatic breach of the protection order and can result in criminal charges."

newzealand,3dq93b,DaedeM,2,Sat Jul 18 23:31:09 2015 UTC,"In general, NZ courts will favour joint care. Your brother has to just take a long-term view and not fuck things up.  He needs a lawyer. This is really important. If he can't afford one, then he should talk to his parents. He will fuck things up majorly, for himself and everyone else, if he does not get a lawyer. (I wish my ex had got a lawyer.) Worst comes to worst, there's community law. They are good, ut over-worked.  He should look at counseling if that is possible.  He needs to be as civil as possible in the meantime."
newzealand,3dq93b,maybemeat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"Your brother needs to see a lawyer and make an application for a parenting order.  This is not intended to be legal advice, just an outline of the usual process.   Unfortunately for him, by trying to prevent her from leaving after their break up, he's committed what is technically domestic violence and hence the protection order. Protection orders automatically cover the child of the applicant so he cannot contact her or the child without her consent. If he breaches the order it is s criminal offence and will not look good for him. The protection order will be temporary for three months then will automatically become final. He needs to defend the protection order - the parenting and protection order proceedings will probably by consolidated and heard together. In his affidavit evidence he can depose to her domestic violence and explain his side of the story.   Once his application for a parenting order / defence of protection order is filed a directions conference will be scheduled which will be a short court appearance to set further directions to progress the matter to a hearing. A lawyer for the child may also be appointed before this happens.   He REALLY needs to see a lawyer. He may be eligible for legal aid which can cover the costs."

The witnesses caught the man in his neighbour's orchard wearing a balaclava with a wheelbarrow and a van and his neighbour's crop.   We heard the same story as was in this article ""So and so was on holiday and forgot to tell anyone about the court case - oops.

A lot of clients have trouble uploading a couple of gigs. The other option to that is posting harddrives which is pretty common practice but it still requires the ability to get clients remotely.  Working in advertising there are always also changes that need to be made and it's much easier if you're with the person otherwise communication becomes really stilted when working on a project. Also if you're working through a company doing freelance work they generally wont let you take the footage/material home with you or work from home unless you're well known.  The only situations where I think it would be possible would be if you were working on rural projects on location, only doing it part time for extra income or if you already had a user base of clientele. I'd like to be proven wrong on that though."

Auckland has a LOT of jobs available for every industry under the sun and you can't say the same thing for the other urban centers. People will go to where the jobs are and right now, they're in Auckland.

You can blame John Key for selling out to warner brothers or the chinese, but the fact remains kiwis are more than willing to bend over for them when it comes to selling their own homes.  I bet the people complaining about Auckland house prices and how the poor lose out, are the exact same ones who go to their real estate agent when they sell and urge them to get the best possible price.

Isn't it a straight case of discrimination, which could be taken to court (I don't know anything about the laws involved in this, so it's a genuine question)?  Also I don't think there is any hypocrisy here. If the seller was concerned with rising house prices, selling at a lower price would have 1) absolutely no effect on the market, and 2) a substantial personal sacrifice. There is no reason to sell at a lower price, as it doesn't help the problem you're concerned about. Banning foreign investment (might) have an effect on the market, which is the major difference."

Personally, I'm not concerned about fixing the problem, because I don't see it as a problem. To do something about foreign investment means that other countries can say no to New Zealand exports. They can refuse on the basis that it steals domestic jobs.   Don't you feel complaining about high prices and then perpetuating that high price when you sell your house is hypocrisy? When I sell my house I don't plan to do it by auction. I want to do it so that I get a good price, but not overly extravagant, and I'll rather pick a new homeowner rather than an investor or landlord. I don't feel these are substantial personal sacrifices.  Obviously, if everyone did this then there would be an affect on the market.

newzealand,3dowsc,Potassium39,4,Sat Jul 18 01:57:01 2015 UTC,New Zealand weather can be quite unpredictable and change very fast.   Very important.

newzealand,3dowsc,eXDee,6,Sat Jul 18 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Start with doc's website: http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/ And have a look at the map, select Tracks: http://maps.doc.govt.nz/mapviewer/index.html?viewer=dto  Theres also this site too: http://nzwalksinfo.co.nz/  I've done some pretty good ones around the Waikato, probably the closest to auckland would be the ones around Ngaruawahia. I can highly recommend many of the ones around the wider waikato area though if you can make it around there, though not sure if that's too far. Some favourites:  -Karioi at Raglan  -Te Tepui Track near Matamata  -Many of the trails around Pirongia  -A quick summit of Kakepuku  -The many trails of the kaimais, especially near karangahake gorge   In regards to alpine, in the North Island you'll only really see those conditions around the actual mountains - that is Tongariro, Ruapehu and Taranaki. Everything else is varying levels of bush on various lower altitude ranges and peaks. Never the less you should always be prepared for New Zealands rapidly changing conditions, and it sounds like you are which is good to hear."
newzealand,3dowsc,eXDee,2,Sat Jul 18 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"We have been looking at the DOCs website up and down, but its hard to really gauge how it is looking there right now. Thats why we prefer to ask around here as well.   Will go and check out nzwalks as well, cheers.  We'd love to try the Tongariro northern circuit, but it just seems to be a bit too much in winter. Thanks for the other options, we'll have a look!"
newzealand,3dowsc,twentygreen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah unless you have the appropriate gear and experience its unadvisable to do Tongariro in winter, especially without a guide.  What sort of timeframe are you looking at? At the moment everything just got soaked by a large front of rain so most trails are going to be quite muddy."
newzealand,3dowsc,weednz,3,Sat Jul 18 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"I just want to stress the word experienced there. Tongariro has screwed people who were doing the 8 hour crossing in the summer. Adding in the circuit (less people), the conditions (snow and ice), and the weather (changeable), makes this a place you do not want to be caught ow knowing exactly what you are doing."
newzealand,3dowsc,TEDcomms,2,Sun Jul 19 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"You need to be able to navigate the route in white out conditions with a map or GPS, full 4 season gear and ice axe and crampons to do the Tongariro Crossing in winter so its pretty serious.  I would look Auckland, Northland, Abel Tasman areas for multi day routes you wont have to use iceaxes on."
newzealand,3dowsc,zippeedeedooda,3,Sun Jul 19 01:30:05 2015 UTC,Cape Brett is a goodie. Tramp a day in. Stay there a day. Tramp a day out. Hike will take about 8 hours for a slow person. Jogging can do it in 4.

newzealand,3dowsc,murl,2,Sun Jul 19 02:16:24 2015 UTC,I haven't really explored the area that well but Thames is 1.5 hr from Auckland. There are plenty of walking tracks around. Crosbies hut and the pinnacles hut are two huts that I'm aware of and you can walk between them and there are various trails in the bush around there.
newzealand,3dowsc,ChopsNZ,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"Probably easier access out of Wellington. Have a look at the doc or wrc sites and see what takes your fancy. Could even ferry to picton and go from there....  Watch out though, weather is pretty wild at the moment. I wouldn't want to be out on the tops some of the days we have had recently.

The Tongariro is about your best bet as it is well marked and pretty popular but it will be fucking cold. It's shorter than you would like but it's winter. I would strongly advise going anywhere remote at this time of year. Avoid the Tararuas. If you are in Auckland or Wellington go for a walk around the Botanic Gardens instead.
newzealand,3dowsc,ae_bb_u_wn_sum_fuk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:05 2015 UTC,Absolutely second avoiding the Tararuas. It'll be hell up there for quite a while.

newzealand,3dowsc,noface,3,Sat Jul 18 08:44:11 2015 UTC,"Day trips into a hut maybe but I can't remember anything more than one night up there that isn't a ridge crossing. There's shit support for winter crossings along those ridges. I'll admit it can be fun pushing into the kind of winds you get up there. But it's not a place for tourists to go. It's really not a place for anyone who doesn't know exactly what their doing to go. Even the crossing between Powel and Jumbo is seriously dangerous with zero visibility and wind chill at negative 20. Put someone who doesn't know the right ridge to go down to the hut, or an inexperienced tramper up there and people will die. It's not like it hasn't happened before."

newzealand,3dq4cl,iainniai,3,Sat Jul 18 10:23:33 2015 UTC,"To put this into an actual framework:  In New Zealand, the process available by which the judiciary can check the executive (ie courts tell the government what to do) is called Judicial Review.  Judicial Review involves the High Court reviewing any decision made by a government agency, but is focused on the process of that decision rather than the substance. If the Court determines that the decision was not reached in the correct way, then it will (generally) make a declaration to that effect, and recommend that the decision be made again in line with its findings.   That said, JR is not binding, and there is also nothing to stop the decision-maker going through the more robust process and coming to the same conclusion. But that doesn't usually happen.  The grounds for a JR are, basically: illegality, taking into account irrelevant considerations, failing to take into account relevant considerations, and ""Wednesdbury unreasonableness"". The latter point is when a decision is so bizarre and unreasonable that no sensible person could have reached it (a pretty high standard, to be sure).  So, you find an exercise of discretion that you disagree with, and challenge it in Court. That kid who got kicked out of school for long hair? Judicially reviewed the Board of Trustees. The Quake Outcasts fighting for a bigger govt payout? Judicial review.  Would this work here? Probably. I don't know much about the mechanics of the policies in play here, but I'd imagine that in theory, a decision to set emissions targets at a certain level is JR-able. But then you would have to prove that the process was flawed, rather than the actual result (and just believe me, it is not Wednesdbury unreasonable.)  But, uh, you might want to start your PledgeMe campaign now. JR doesn't come cheap."

newzealand,3dmxuf,mexicanweasel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:30:45 2015 UTC,Thanks to your question I actually tested stuff.    I was under the impression kindle app book reader only allowed books in my amazon account. It appears I was mistaken. I just found I could open a book in .mobi format that I had in my dropbox account. It did take 2 goes to open it before it opened the book.  It could be why I thought it didn't work when I tried it before.  Currently I am using kybook to read ebooks (epub format) on my iphone. The Kindle app I have on the same phone connects to my amazon account and so only has access to books I have on that account.   Who knows what the kindle app + device reports back to amazon wrt books one reads.    The question at the start of my comment was to ask how you pick ebooks to read. DO you know the author and/title or are you just looking at books of a particular genre.  One of the links that /u/NIGHTFIRE777 pasted below used irc to download books. It is usually downloading a book at a time or sometimes a series of books. It means you have found a book you want to read by reading a review or someone recommended it and you just want to download it.  I've also seen some collections where someone put online the entire book collection or a collection of sci-fi books or crime novels or romance novels.  Some of these may include books you never wish to read and some books you would enjoy.
newzealand,3dmxuf,iamcoder83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:46:21 2015 UTC,For the most part I'll be looking for specific books because I'm fussy and would rather re-read an old favourite than risk starting something that sucks.

While I'm extremely close to getting silver tier with Air NZ now, one of my flights Auckland-Singapore is apparently ineligible to earn leaving me just short. On the flights, the class of booking shown on my documents and tickets are apparently the Air NZ classes (Air NZ codesharing), and not the operator's classes, which is fucking stupid. Singapore being the operator decided the L was the equivalent of their 'Q', and so no points.   The return Singapore to Christchurch was a 'T' on the ticket, so I had actually asked Air NZ prior to travelling if the T flight would earn as per their tables T's were ineligible prior to Jan (though L's were). This lookup table however is completely irrelevant due to Air NZ's codesharing. The 'T' flight back mapped to something eligible."

My favourite part of it is the lack of writing surrounding the genre - there's not a strong academic backbone to lowbrow (or it's bastard offspring 'street art'), so there is less of a perceived barrier between the general public and the art practitioner.

Converting to dairy is a tough decision and farmers have learned not really to rely on politicians to make these decisions for them. A lot of farmers who converted to dairy were producing other livestock and had had poor returns for a long time. Dairy had been trending up for a long time. Short term fluctuations dont really feature into it because prices fluctuating are the norm for farmers. The government doesn't provide subsidies for farming so these decisions really fall under the realm of farmers. As much as politicians like to think they are important, in this regard they have very little influence. Farmers are independent business man making decisions based on constantly changing projections. I bet he would find it a lot more difficult if it was his land and his money on the line. Not saying they made the right decision but it was an understandable decision given the projections and trends at the time."

They're not twiddling their thumbs - things like subsidising irrigation schemes or opening conservation land up to mining are doubling down on commodities, while spurning other sectors.  Similarly, our position in the TPPA ""negotiations"" (that we'll throw our non-farming sectors to the wolves on e.g. IP) is all redolant of a Muldoonesque effort to pretend that what worked in 1950 is what will work forever."

newzealand,3dohay,HardKase,4,Sat Jul 18 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"Just as a single example, here's an artistic representation of ""gender fluidity"". It's a concept I don't entirely understand, but I kind of see it like, to some people, gender is like an emotion, it can change multiple times in a single day. You can feel happy, sad, angry, you can feel masculine or feminine or somewhere in the middle. It's not a static state.  Attempting to account for these kinds of people on a form is difficult, like asking ""What's your emotion right now."", it's not a useful question because it could change five minutes after the form is done.  ""Gender diverse"", is incredibly vague. It groups together so many different kinds of people with different ideas about gender identity who may not even agree with each other.  That said, it's still better than not acknowledging them at all, as was the case before. Which is why I'm happy it's there.  I think overall, the concept of what ""gender"" is, is on the move, it's going to be in hot debate for decades, and all these forms can do is hold on and do the best they can until we have some idea of where it's going. Or until having a gender question isn't useful at all anymore."
newzealand,3dohay,Supertrinko,4,Sat Jul 18 01:05:11 2015 UTC,"I just think it depends on the purpose of the data. For example we may be interested in knowing how many people are born bioloogically one gender. But suddenly the statistics may show treands to a particular gender because of preference.  I like to think of it like your given name vs your preferred name. You have one unchanging thing, but you're not limited to that if you don't want it."
newzealand,3dohay,Dark_Souls,3,Sat Jul 18 02:12:28 2015 UTC,"We already know how many people were born as each sex from birth statistics. And it's not often that specific information would be more useful than gender, I don't think"
newzealand,3dohay,kochipoik,2,Sat Jul 18 08:18:45 2015 UTC,"I think these days we have that distinction by comparing ""gender"" and ""sex"" as different things. Sex comparing Male and Female based on your reproductive systems. You can ask the question:  What was your designated sex at birth:   Female Male Decline to answer   I specifically say ""designated"" because of children born with multiple sexes (absorbed a twin in development, or something like that), yet most of the time for whatever reason, only one gender goes on your birth certificate, so that would be designated. And of course ""at birth"" is to differentiate from people who change their sex completely with a new reproductive system.  And of course some may take offence to this question where they've tried so hard to disregard this sex at birth, so declining to answer is important.  Again though, where would this sort of thing be useful. What sort of research would use this data as opposed to what people identify as?  EDIT: Simpler, thinking about it. Just ask what's on the person's birth certificate."
newzealand,3dohay,Supertrinko,2,Sat Jul 18 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Simpler, thinking about it. Just ask what's on the person's birth certificate.   Yeah. I guess thats the wordier way of writing it into a questionaire. But thats all we're really asking when it comes to it."
newzealand,3dohay,Dark_Souls,4,Sat Jul 18 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. But if you think about how census statistics can influence political changes, then simply putting ""female"" isn't representing your situation properly, which could be a problem."
newzealand,3dohay,SpongePuff,2,Sat Jul 18 00:51:29 2015 UTC,"Some may, some may not. The idea is that gender is subjective."

newzealand,3dohay,Dark_Souls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhh, I'm not sure taking the Tumblr approach is for the best. I'm all for the idea that someone feels that they are the other gender trapped in the wrong body -- at the very least from being a tolerant human being and not wanting to make someone feel like shit needlessly -- but it does start to take the piss when you end up with this ""I'm a rothsexual catkin but I identify as a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt"" shit.   I'd much rather that we start breaking away from the idea of gender roles rather than trying to pander on forms that might be asking this stuff for legitimate scientific reasons. Having a Y chromosome doesn't meant that I should like rugby, listen to The Rock, and not cry during movies, but it does mean that I might be more susceptible to, you know, testicular cancer."
newzealand,3dohay,oconnomiyaki,3,Sat Jul 18 06:58:50 2015 UTC,"Since gender (not sex (in most cases anyway)) is socially constructed though, isn't it a valid part of breaking down gender roles creating newer, more diverse gender roles that you personally feel more identification with?"
newzealand,3dohay,xochie,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:18:20 2015 UTC,"Well we are talking about forms, right? While there is a distinction between sex and gender, for a lot of people they are used synonymously. And for all the hormone treatment and plastic surgery in the world, you're not going to change things like having a prostate.  I mean I get it, there's been cases of nurses still calling transgender people using the pronoun of their birth sex, and that's harrowing. But in some cases it's still important to know what your inner biology is. I know that's not very PC, but it's true.  I suppose maybe you could have two parts to a form, like when your asked if that's your preferred name. Have it as an optional set. So ""What is your sex?"" and then ""Is your gender the same?"""
newzealand,3dohay,oconnomiyaki,2,Sat Jul 18 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between gender and gender roles though. Saying there's no difference between genders is as bad as that ""I'm colorblind"" shit.  And I have to admit I very much disagree with the slippery slope argument"
newzealand,3dohay,kochipoik,-2,Sat Jul 18 08:21:42 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about ethnicity with the colorblind comment? Because I find that almost a little bit racist, for lack of a better term. The color of your skin has no bearing on your personality: your culture and upbringing do.   Likewise, I feel that there's still too much ""Your boy plays with dolls? What's wrong with him?"" going on.   As someone who looks very masculine but doesn't feel it, I've struggled with the concept of gender in the past. And I can't claim that my experience is the same as everyone's. But I know I came to the conclusion I just wasn't a ""dudebro"" manly man and that was okay. I actually thank video games a bit, especially MMOs, for allowing me to explore that in a safe environment.  That's not to say that there aren't legitimate cases of people being gender-trapped. There's that case of the kid who lost his penis as birth so they raised him as a girl and he always felt wrong. But there are also cases that show sometimes transgender cases stem from idolization: in the case of MTF, they want to become the object of their attraction.   It's all very murky and it gets obnoxious when people run around stating things like they are objective truths when this could well all be another social construct.   Whatever, I'm rambling now, but I stand by my point that saying gender is fluid and that ""I might feel like a man and a woman in the same day"" is misrepresenting other issues and introducing an element of role expectation. Indeed, masculine and feminine seem like binary terms. Ironically, I have a condition that predisposes me to binary thinking, to the point where even though I like both soccer and NFL, I find myself only able to like one at a time -- and that will bleed over into other areas, like ""Because I like X, I must also like Y and not do Z"" -- but I still see value in people finding more grey areas when it comes to your chromosomes and testosterone levels versus your personality."

I know people who are still discovering their own gender identity, because to them, it's such a complicated issue. You can't account for everything on a form.

I can only imagine the argument that would ensue if someone tried to call me cisgender...

Transgender is a term that's been around for decades and ""trans"" is common in lots of words like transport, transit and translate. Cis (and by extension cisgender) is just the opposite.  I think the reason why cis has become a term here is to avoid the baked in premise that there is the unspoken ""normal"" vs trans.  We could create the fictional but logical word of ""cisport"" so if transport means to move something cisport would mean to not move something. As you can see it's a strange word as it describes a lack of an event rather than an event but it still makes sense.  On some level I agree it's a strange thing to label, personally I dislike the term ""teetotaler"" because it's a label for NOT doing something. There aren't that many things that have a special word for nothing. Normally we have a word such as ""smoker"" and if you don't smoke we label that ""non-smoker"", just the same term with a negative prefix. But a term like teetotaler begs the question why aren't there labels for not doing other things? /tangent"

Trans mtf/ftm should be under the appropriate gender, not lumped in under a gender diverse category.   Also transgender is already an umbrella word, it seems silly to have a new term. Especially one that on the face of it seems to describe genderqueer people to the exclusion of other groups.  And it still doesn't cover intersex adequately at all."
newzealand,3dkfor,Calalamity,19,Fri Jul 17 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"It divorces male/female identifying trans people...   If you want to study the transgender population then you do have to separate them from the born-male, born-female population.    And it still doesn't cover intersex adequately at all.   Because they don't care about the specifics. They are gathering information on broader groups. Also bare in mind that all non born male/female groups combined make up less that 1% of the population. You can't subdivide things too finely and still get meaningful samples.  This is about gathering statistics with which to conduct research. It isn't about re-enforcing people's gender-identity."

newzealand,3dkfor,kochipoik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:50:29 2015 UTC,That is an awful way to do it. The gender someone identifies as is the gender they are. You are talking biological sex for the first part. And in that case why not a third option for intersexed people.

newzealand,3dkfor,Calalamity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:36:22 2015 UTC,It's two different concepts. So if you changed the word gender to sex in your first paragraph it would make more sense.

That should be done with a sex question, not by merging gender identity with sex.  Also my point wasn't to get rid trans mtf/ftm as an option, just listing it under the appropriate main heading. ie   Male 11   Male / Tāne 12   Transgender female to male / Tangata ira tāne Female 21   Female / Wahine 22   Transgender male to female / Whakawahine Gender diverse 30   Gender diverse not further defined / Ira tāngata kōwhiri kore 39    Gender diverse not elsewhere classified / Ira tāngata kōwhiri kore    This is about gathering statistics with which to conduct research.

newzealand,3dkbo9,BuffK,9,Fri Jul 17 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think the issue isn't foreign investors, but investors in general - and that's due to the deeper issue that current legislation makes housing in New Zealand safer and better than a lot of other investment options.  What we need, rather than an ethnic group to blame, is to make housing a less attractive investment option. That way, investors (whether they be foreign, or local baby boomers, or whatever) might put their money into other types of investment that would a) grow the economy more and b) stop contributing to the ridiculous house prices in Auckland.  Unfortunately, that won't sit well with people that already have a lot of money invested in housing. They'd rather blame the Chinese than themselves."
newzealand,3dkbo9,electric_banjo,20,Fri Jul 17 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"That's understandable, foreign ownership is a legitimate issue that needs discussion.

Keep in mind that was immediately after the release. The quote further down the article clarifies the point he was making:   “It really reduces down this complex economic problem. None of the actual issues around foreign ownership have been discussed by Labour and they’ve turned it into a race debate.”   While there are offshore Chinese buyers picking up houses in New Zealand, Ng says the actual numbers aren’t known and Labour’s data doesn’t help.   I don't think you can write off people's experience of racism as false accusations, there's a quote from Kristen Ng's article that I posted further up in the thread and I think it's a reasonable response:   He and his frighteningly large support base of Stuff and Herald commenters (if there were ever a time to say never read the comments, it is now) can deny this being about race, accuse offended Chinese commentators of being too PC, and even have the temerity to ask us to just “forget racism” in order to have a “mature public debate,” but when a party bases their foreign housing market analysis squarely upon whether a name sounds Chinese or not, well, that is just straight-up racial profiling.

If a person's surname is Xu they are probably Chinese. If you're saying this is unreasonable you're deluded. So what. Big fucking deal. They did this for Samoans, Indians, Europeans. Labour came up with a whole bunch of them.    housing market analysis squarely upon whether a name sounds Chinese   That's bullshit as well. Twyford mentioned the same thing is happening overseas. Labour have tapped every resource they could to argue for their policy, which should be the default position anyway.  A lot of people want to be victims since that gets them sympathy I suppose.

There are many arguments against racial profiling: It's inaccurate, there are more effective methods, it alienates a segment of the population, it can escalate racial tensions, and it's morally wrong. Even if it was 100% right this time, which Labour acknowledges it wasn't it's use should always be discouraged lest it start to be used more widely and inappropriately.   A lot of people want to be victims since that gets them sympathy I suppose. You can only cry wolf so many times before people call bullshit. The truth offends you so what. Cry me a river.   People don't want to be victims, they're sick of their treatment. The Human Rights Commission report in the article makes a pretty clear case for a trend of othering Chinese New Zealanders:   “When New Zealanders are asked to identify which group faces the most discrimination, Asians have been cited first year-after-year,”   That isn't crying wolf that's the truth, and it's a problem we should be trying to fix rather than one we tell people 'so what' over."
newzealand,3dkbo9,deadnagastorage,11,Fri Jul 17 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"Self identifying as a race or ethnic group is quite different from someone else identifying you that way for their own purpose, wouldn't you agree?   This study has nothing to do with Chinese as an ethnicity or culture, it's about Chinese as a word for ""somebody who lives in China"" and only uses a cultural identifier to infer possible nationality.  This is the logic of the study broken down for you:  The purpose of the study is to determine whether investors in China are participating in the New Zealand property market in a significant way.  Assumptions  1) People who live in China are largely ethnically and culturally Chinese 2) People with a culturally Chinese name are probably ethnically Chinese 3) People who do not have a culturally Chinese name (example: Steve Jones) are probably not residents of China.  Given those assumptions, we now look at a list of purchaser names. We see that 40% or whatever the number was of the purchasers have culturally Chinese names. Because of assumptions 2 and 3 we can assume that this set of people are largely ethnically Chinese.  This set of people is not interesting because it includes both ethnically Chinese New Zealanders and people living in China. We have no interest in the former group, they are not the target of this study, we only care about people living in China. So what we do is look at the percentage of New Zealand's population that identify as ethnically Chinese, which is 9% or whatever, and what their average income is. We get this from census data. We then ask, given the economic status of ethnically Chinese New Zealanders and their population size, could we reasonably expect them to be this highly represented in real estate purchases? The conclusion of that is no, it is unlikely that ethnically Chinese New Zealanders could account for so many purchases. Therefore, a large portion of the 40% of real estate purchases by people with culturally Chinese names must be people living in China.  I cannot see how this could be considered racist. The assumptions made (1,2 and 3) are so obviously true that to disagree with them is absurd. The study shows that ethnically Chinese New Zealanders are not causally responsible for the problems in the property market. How could you interpet it as putting blame on them? The only way people could interpret this as racist is if they fundamentally misunderstand the purpose and methodology of the study. It seems absurd to get upset about something that could only be construed as racist if you completely misunderstand it. If we start taking that possibility into account then it would be impossible to openly discuss anything that even tangentially relates to an ethnic group or really any group that have historically been the target of discrimination.   The other way to take offense is to make no distinction between Chinese as an ethnic or cultural group and Chinese as in someone who lives in the country called China. If you do that it is insane and makes any discussion of world news, politics, international trade, etc racist which is ridiculous."

For me to be dragged into this debate, to be considered part of causing the housing crisis because my last name sounds Chinese, is a huge problem for me.”    As for your final point:   So because some people are racist we can't talk about anything involving nationality,race etc. Got it.   No, but because some people are racist we need to put in the effort to avoid creating narratives that can reinforce that racism or inspire it in others."

For what it's worth I think the city itself is more beautiful than ever despite growing poverty issues. The trains are far more consistent than they used to be too, and the hop cards work well for the most part.  I think the city is growing in a really cool way despite the issues with housing prices, with the Arts festival now happening annually and the other festivals that happen, along with a growing music scene it seems like there's a lot more going on in terms of culture too. That's just my perspective though."

Yeah, people complain that it's expensive, and it is. But it's also much fresher and of a much higher quality than what you'd get in many of countries. The internet is finally unlimited, fast, and cheap. The UFB roll out has been a bit slow/patchy in places, but for those who can get it, it's great! Can't speak for everywhere, but from what I've seen our cities have been undergoing a bit of a renaissance. Lots of urban regeneration and investment in public art. There's also been some good investment in public transport and cycling lately (although as always, we could do with more). They've become much more lively, and are starting to take on characters of their own. There's been some good investment in critical infrastructure such as new roads, wind farms, etc. The technology sector's been doing pretty well. Lots of new high-tech jobs are being created. We're working on making our houses warmer (Mandatory double glazing on new builds, subsidies on insulation, mandatory insulation on rentals). This will really pay off in the years to come.   Having said that, we're not perfect by a long shot and we still have a lot of work to do. We still have our fair share of issues, and there's people out there who are struggling.  I live and hope that we can keep working towards making NZ a high-tech warm-house arty foodie paradise ;)."

Not sure what he means by making them fairer - they're no longer trials if the dismissal requires cause and I'm not sure what other changes he could have in mind.  Not quite sold on Little as a leader at the moment. It feels like the Greens are still the most vocal opposition party when it comes to worker's rights which is surprising. He's clearly trying to position Labour to take back some of the centre but he has to walk a fine line between doing that and gutting many of the party's principles."
newzealand,3dkvr4,Delphinium1,7,Fri Jul 17 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"I think the way to make them fairer is to provide that the employer has to warn that if the employee doesn't up his/her game to an expected standard then they could be dismissed under the provision.  So that way the employee at least gets the opportunity to prove that they should keep their job.  It would be a case of codifying what, anecdotal evidence suggest, is happening in the employment situation where termination under the trial period clause occurs."

It would just make it even harder to employ people. The 90 day trial has been great for my business as I have been able to employ UCOL students and see how they go. Had some terrible useless people that it has been great to easily get rid of and 3rd time around we got an excellent employee who fits in well, does a great job and is now in his 4th month of employment."

It was a bit of a punt getting her to manage a team without a track record, but it was a niche role and she was given the benefit of the doubt. She seemed to be fine while she got up to speed on her portfolio and team, but as soon as the handover was complete it became apparent she wasn't a good fit. She'd literally start crying in meetings if her work or approach was criticised and was extremely unprofessional in the way she'd talk about her management colleagues behind their back to her team.

I presume you're talking about being equal economically, but does your logic apply to art/beauty/music? If not, why not?    Again, contractarianism versus rights-based concepts is no small philosophical debate. A person's ""property"" in a job is their ability to predict their future circumstances and make economic decisions based on that certainty.   If you make that assumption, what do you assume the employers ""property"" is in the employment relationship?   It needs to be a majority, not many, not one example you encountered.   Where does this ""need"" to be a majority come from? If the majority outlawed guide dogs it would only be a minority affected. Libertarians stick up for the rights of minorities against the interests of majorities, especially in the case of the smallest minority - the individual. Don't ban steak from men because babies can't chew etc.    The law has to hit the optimum.   You're assuming an objective optimum and have a lot of faith in the efficacy of legislative force."

Unfortunately, this would include a lot of black Americans and brown NZers - but their social status / class, not so much their race, would often be the reason for the stop. (Obviously the two cultural markers are deeply entwined, too, but I'm just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.)

It likewise isn't racial profiling to stop speeders, if you were to find that those stopped were predominately of a given age or ethnicity.

Most had to carpool to work so the one with a car on their restricted license with passengers got pinged. There was a fair amount of peer pressure and expectation involved. You don't really want to say no to your cuz who needs a lift because everyone would think you were a stink cunt. It was a pretty tight community and pretty poor to boot."

Everyone was happy,  income was high,  new buildings popping up everywhere and then my mate,  that dam boy,  decided to convince me to split one of my districts to switch half of it to focus on heavy industry and the other half to pander to citizens and low density commercial,  I had it set up as a district that provided clean smart housing to the workers for the industry, gave free transport out to work and had parks and trees all around the industry to keep the everyone happy.  I kept telling him,  it won't work,  I don't need to change it, just no,  and then I went screw it,  let's try your way,  next thing you know,  the whole economy crashed,  it was chaos, he didn't realise splitting the districts into two made the industry all pack up and leave because all the workers they had were sent over to some retail shops instead. It was hell,  I had to quickly delete districts,  rebuild the old district,  apply all my original policies and get the economy running again,  I still haven't got it running smoothly like it was and now I have an abandoned industry area. Half of my income has gone.    I have a bitter taste in my mouth,  I nurtured that city,  and in one moment,  a stupid decision by someone who didn't understand MY economy and thought he knew better than me,  went and single handedly destroyed my economy.

That 3.53 trillion of printed money.  A barrel of oil is trading at around $50.00 USD. So they printed in value the equivalent of 706 million barrels of oil.  You must be able to print bread, wood and oil or otherwise it's like the financial system doesn't have any creditability.  You don't need to hear from a economist, we need to hear from a merchant banker."

newzealand,3djqkx,sarahexperience,8,Fri Jul 17 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Can mccready just go away already? I feel like anything he attaches his name to has no credibility. He's got convictions for filing false tax returns (while he was an accountant) and blackmail. After john banks got his verdict reversed, his biggest success to date is having Trevor mallard charged with fighting in a public place. His occupational overuse syndrome which has seen him on a benefit since 1995 sure as hell doesn't stop him spending hours researching and filing submissions."
newzealand,3djqkx,devonhex,12,Thu Jul 16 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"I think the system is working well enough - he had no standing in the matter which was pointed out to him by the Courts at the earliest proper opportunity.   Access to justice is an incredibly important principle and really lies at the very fundament of our democracy. It is absolutely vital that private citizens be able to initiate criminal proceedings so that it's not only the arm of the State which is able to do so. If anything, the fact that McCready does this (and usually fails, publicised by the news media) serves as a reminder to society that they can access the Courts on their own."
newzealand,3djqkx,Delphinium1,2,Thu Jul 16 21:59:20 2015 UTC,It depends - there is always a line that can be crossed in terms of litigation which is why we have a vexatious litigant clause in our legal system. McCready probably isn't breaching that - he generally only runs one case at a time but the option is there if the High Court feels it is necessary. I don't like McCready personally but you are right that his access to the legal system is important and should only be curtailed in extreme circumstances.
newzealand,3djqkx,devonhex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:33:24 2015 UTC,"This deals specifically with bringing civil proceedings to Court. And I think as well, the Law Commission recommended that private persons bringing criminal prosecutions be excluded from vexatious litigation laws."
newzealand,3djqkx,Delphinium1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:40:45 2015 UTC,Huh you might well be right there - I though vexatious litigation would cover all court proceedings but it does appear that it is just civil.
newzealand,3djqkx,devonhex,3,Fri Jul 17 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"Well, criminal law procedure has evolved mainly to place restraints on government power - as a protection against the tyranny of kings, if you like. So it would be a far more grave matter to remove a private individual's access to the Courts on criminal matters than it would for civil matters.  Entick v Carrington and all that has evolved from the principles underlying it is worth looking into, if you're interested."

If the politics of personality work in john key's favour then they sure as hell work against mccready."

I didn't say i hate him or that what he's pursuing is without merit. My point is that if a more credible person was representing these private prosecutions the public would be less likely to write them off as the ramblings of an idiot, which they currently do.

People attack his character (justly so, because of the nature of his criminal convictions) and the real issues get drowned out. I don't think you can dispute that and I'm not trying to say his private prosecutions are invalid, just that they would be taken more seriously by the public and the media if a more credible person was fronting them."

It's a messed-up organisation (ever has been since all the money got nicked), so it really does need sorted out, one way or another.  And it's certainly true that for many years to come, Kathy Grant will be remembered as the person who made 50% of Otago-Southland's healthcare workers redundant and shut down crucial health services in some of the secondary centres like Invercargill, Gore, Balclutha etc.    She will be very, very unpopular, especially with medical students at Otago who will have far fewer opportunities in Dunedin.  edit: this post is rife with conjecture, so be prepared for me to be wrong."

Information on the State Services Commission's website shows a maximum daily pay of $1062 in that band.   That's exactly what it is.
