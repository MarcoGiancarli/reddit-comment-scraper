EquestriaGirls,3e1zm4,EggheadDash,3,Tue Jul 21 09:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the character's hands' lack of palms is natural for the character, but I can say that the artist did a good job turning a Steven Universe character into an Equestria Girl and a pony."
EquestriaGirls,3e1zm4,FringePioneer,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:25 2015 UTC,"It is natural to her. This character has individual floating fingers that can change formation in order to use different functions. Here's an example of her using four of them to create a screen and using the remaining one as a stylus. Some other, more spoilery functions (if you view the gifs):  Helicopter blades  Arm cannon  Stasis field"
EquestriaGirls,3e1zm4,DryB0nes,3,Tue Jul 21 10:28:18 2015 UTC,Sounds like someone in this thread needs to start believing in steven.

EquestriaGirls,3e1zm4,DryB0nes,3,Tue Jul 21 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"I don't remember. So maybe. I'm mean, I feel everyone should feel the magic of friendship and believe in steven. As well know who the author of the journals is."
