You hear this shit so much. ""Hurr durr you sound like ghostface"". I imagine it's a slap in the face for Action Bronson, every time he hears this. Eventho Action Bronson has showed us who he is, what he does and what he's about, people still compare him to Ghostface, just because some people started saying that on the internet. And that because of his damn voice? What the fuck is he gonna do about that? Stop rapping because he sounds like somebody else??  I hear people saying it's also the way he raps, but tbh I don't see it. I have been listening to Ghostface eversince I was a little shit and I loved Bam Bams music eversince his early Outdoorsmen projects and their music feels soo different.  There are very few things that get me mad in this industry, and this comparison is one of them, because love what Bronson has been doing. I love his music, I fucking love the beats he raps on, he has a fucking ear for good beats, I love his self aware cheesy B movie style music videos and I love Fuck That's Delicious.  I have said this before, if he is so bad, how come he works with all these top notch producers? Why do Rappers like Joey Bada$$ love to work with him? Or why is Tyler such a huge fanboy of his?"

hiphopheads,3dyljd,bobbyjoechan,42,Mon Jul 20 17:53:31 2015 UTC,Is this as pathetic as it looks or...? Shooters? Come on man.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,TheMightyTreebeard,75,Mon Jul 20 16:41:28 2015 UTC,Dudes mentioning tweets and making a dude disappear in the same sentence.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,SylvesterLundgren,11,Mon Jul 20 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"If you didn't know it's 2015 already, now there should be no question."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,YcantweBfrients,13,Mon Jul 20 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"What gets me, is the guy is RTing news outlets linking to a youtube video where he essentially is making death threats.  Isnt that really fucking stupid?"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,SylvesterLundgren,42,Mon Jul 20 17:36:14 2015 UTC,nothin harder than a grown man in a room alone yelling at a camera about another guy deleting a handful of tweets
hiphopheads,3dyljd,jett_jackson,23,Mon Jul 20 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"This is so corny, and of course everyone is on their WE REALLY OUT HERE FAM lame shit."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,OmarBarksdale,158,Mon Jul 20 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"Ghost, this shit makes you look weak. Action always tip toes around these loaded questions about you and messed up once. literally in the sentence before he was throwing respect at you. You aint hard, your whining."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,donkeykidd,72,Mon Jul 20 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Uhhhhh, he just mentioned having people who can do ""disappearing acts"" in any state and hanging him/gutting him. You can't do that."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,DamnCroissants,27,Mon Jul 20 16:57:27 2015 UTC,I'm interested in Ghostface's Wyoming crew.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,cards_dot_dll,8,Mon Jul 20 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"Popcorn in hand, lawn chair out and ready"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,DrenchedDropes,26,Mon Jul 20 16:31:00 2015 UTC,GFK is talking that old school NY shit talk. Ghost you're an honorary Italian for real
hiphopheads,3dyljd,SauteedGoogootz,113,Mon Jul 20 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"this is gonna be the most important beef since nas/jay  edit: holy shit 2:08 ""big ass beard that one day i might set that shit on fire""  edit2: if this becomes the top post of all time i honestly wouldnt care. this is history"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,berlinwood100,18,Mon Jul 20 16:32:10 2015 UTC,"People gotta stop starting beefs across generations, it's not fair. How can Bronson respond to Ghost, an established legend, without sounding like a fuckboi? Ghost should pick on somebody his own size"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Jaktastik,48,Mon Jul 20 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"Lol, he's gotta play the long game. Don't say shit for now, release a couple of his own landmark albums, become a legend then come out with a dis track eight years from now, talking about how GFK shouldn't have doubted him. And it will be even funnier if GFK is out the game at that point."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,YcantweBfrients,192,Mon Jul 20 17:53:01 2015 UTC,If GFK ain't outta the game by 52 who could possibly diss him...
hiphopheads,3dyljd,lamstradamus,33,Mon Jul 20 18:34:44 2015 UTC,i don't think it would be inaccurate to say ghost took it too far with his first response but bronson did diss him first.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,berlinwood100,44,Mon Jul 20 17:18:08 2015 UTC,Except Bronson is no where near Ghostface/Jay/Nas's level
hiphopheads,3dyljd,snaxsnax,81,Mon Jul 20 16:35:35 2015 UTC,I think he was being sarcastic.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,MyloXy,41,Mon Jul 20 16:41:49 2015 UTC,Its like throwing a cat in a lions cage. Bronson doesnt have a chance
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Billcosbyspuddingpop,13,Mon Jul 20 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"Ghostface - Former drug dealer, linked to multiple murders by the FBI, grew up poor in New York  Action - Gourmet Chef, often high, comparable to a small car  This is gonna be interesting."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,xxxWeedSn1p3Rxxx,77,Mon Jul 20 16:57:59 2015 UTC,comparable to a small car
hiphopheads,3dyljd,flrfmp2yashit,45,Mon Jul 20 17:19:33 2015 UTC,and Ghostface is far more respected in the rap game then Bronson. Its a lose lose situation for action on this one
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Billcosbyspuddingpop,20,Mon Jul 20 17:01:01 2015 UTC,Riiiight but if Ghost is actually threatening murder over a fucking SBNation interview does he really deserve that respect?
hiphopheads,3dyljd,clave94,152,Mon Jul 20 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"If rap music has taught me anything, that's the only way to get results."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,xxxWeedSn1p3Rxxx,262,Mon Jul 20 17:15:27 2015 UTC,respect by fear.  Not scared personally but I don't have to worry about running up on Either of them.  Also I heard ghostface really does have some great hands.  He broke mase's jaw back in the day
hiphopheads,3dyljd,THE_SWAG_CHAMP,189,Mon Jul 20 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is everything I've wanted since Bronson got big. this is what set Ghostface off"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,snaxsnax,311,Mon Jul 20 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"I would love to have a serious but not-so serious beef between Ghost and Bronson ending in a peace-treaty collab. Could be album of the year imo. Have a few diss tracks from each side, run into each other at the club and have a little brawl, then make peace and do an episode of Fuck That's Delicious together. Please respond to this video Bronson."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,_adidias11_,53,Mon Jul 20 16:33:24 2015 UTC,Album of the year and it's not even a thought yet?  Yeah idk about that ghost likes to hold grudges.  He's kind of a salty NYC guy through and through.   Even method man has acknowledged that.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,THE_SWAG_CHAMP,16,Mon Jul 20 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Ghostface you doing Action a favor by this, giving him exposer"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,aacarbone,32,Mon Jul 20 16:23:39 2015 UTC,Exposer
hiphopheads,3dyljd,S_C_80,10,Mon Jul 20 16:44:03 2015 UTC,I ain't no english major
hiphopheads,3dyljd,aacarbone,8,Mon Jul 20 16:46:26 2015 UTC,Not an English minor either by the looks of it

hiphopheads,3dyljd,snaxsnax,25,Mon Jul 20 16:33:43 2015 UTC,lmao ghostface is so childish
hiphopheads,3dyljd,michaelceltic1888,18,Mon Jul 20 16:41:17 2015 UTC,Welcome to NY
hiphopheads,3dyljd,rantstanley,38,Mon Jul 20 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"YO SON, GET THE HEATER B. C'MON GOD  Edit: but forreal, Ghost is crazy for this one."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,CheatedOnOnce,17,Mon Jul 20 17:17:42 2015 UTC,Ghostface comin' for you next
hiphopheads,3dyljd,SoberDreams,57,Mon Jul 20 17:18:33 2015 UTC,I knew this would happen at some point. I knew action would eventually get tired of hearing how he sounds like ghost and say something smart in frustration.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,raiderrash,58,Mon Jul 20 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Smh this is embarassing. How much of an insecure, close minded piece of shit do you have to be to threaten to literally kill someone because they shrugged you off for 15 seconds to defend their own legitmacy.  Especially when that person has called you a legend countless times.  Ghostface has made some good records but I dont know how anyone can defend him on this. We got people petitioning against Kanye (not here on hhh obvs)  for ""being a dick"" and in the same breath praising Ghostface.  Dude is out here spamming internet forums like an angsty emotionally stunted 14 yr old kid. Fucking pathetic."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,fapfriend,40,Mon Jul 20 19:37:04 2015 UTC,What prompted this I wonder

hiphopheads,3dyljd,GrimBimsby,13,Mon Jul 20 16:31:05 2015 UTC,Bronson did an interview where he basically said Ghostface has fallen off
hiphopheads,3dyljd,snaxsnax,20,Mon Jul 20 16:34:22 2015 UTC,o shit ghost is back
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Koelcast,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Ghost never left
hiphopheads,3dyljd,HunterReddeh,20,Mon Jul 20 16:38:46 2015 UTC,Serious did no one listen to sour soul or his entire fucking discography?! Ghost face and raekwon never stopped bein bosses
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Kimjongdoom,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, no one listened to his entire fucking discography. No one"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,SoberDreams,14,Mon Jul 20 17:17:37 2015 UTC,You slept on Sour Soul???
hiphopheads,3dyljd,99639,18,Mon Jul 20 16:59:44 2015 UTC,i was talking about him posting on hhh
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Koelcast,66,Mon Jul 20 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"he's gonna start beef with you now, for saying this"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,bashfulcity,31,Mon Jul 20 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"For real though, how excited is Bronson that Ghostface dropped N-bombs on him? He's probably at home feeling all accepted and shit now."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,NowGoodbyeForever,16,Mon Jul 20 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"Bronson is probably at home thinking what the fuck he should do. Man that sucks, I hope Ghostface wont be a bitch about this, now that Bronsons apologized."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,UncleCarnage,8,Mon Jul 20 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"Damn man I want to see how this plays out, I got respect for them both but this really made things serious now. Hopefully no violence but hey a nice little diss track ain't bad for hip hop every now and then."

hiphopheads,3dyljd,856521,7,Mon Jul 20 17:10:22 2015 UTC,Did Ghost really just make a video threatening to kill Bronson lmao this is pathetic
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Tusaa,14,Mon Jul 20 16:53:07 2015 UTC,how to stay relevant 101
hiphopheads,3dyljd,tangyfish,5,Mon Jul 20 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"This man said ""I got shooters""  &  ""I know the tour schedule"""
hiphopheads,3dyljd,BurkyBig,5,Mon Jul 20 17:10:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like Ghost might have to go back to rapping with a mask on
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Lamar_Scrodum,5,Mon Jul 20 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"Let's be real though: you don't get this kind of reaction for saying something relatively mild like Bronson did unless the person hearing it catches some truth in the words and it scares the shit out of them.  Bronson called the dude a legend and established respect for what he's done. He just doesn't think his new stuff is up to par. Ghost throwing out a bunch of smack about his old material doesn't change that shit. I mean, I love me some Ghost. Growing up, Ghost was my favorite in Wu Tang. But the dude hasn't had bars like the old days in a while, even if I can dig his new shit. He's one of the members of Wu-Tang that's losing their ability to hang, and I gotta say, I enjoyed Mr. Wonderful a hell of a lot more than Sour Soul.  Maybe it's just the comparison to other Wu-Tang releases in recent memory that drag Ghost's recent stuff down. Pop in Raekwon's Fly International Luxurious Art and it's like he never left. Maybe the best rap album I've heard all year so far. Compared to that, saying Ghost doesn't rap like he used to seems pretty damn true.  Beyond that, is anyone really surprised that Bronson thinks he's better than Ghost? Of course he does. Every rapper gunning for the top has to believe in their soul, mind, and body that they're the best in the world and the greatest of all time. Lose that, and you lose a whole lot of fire. Right or wrong in your opinion, dude did what he had to do for his art and his brand.  I think Ghost probably still thinks he's the GOAT too, and that's cool. But if he thought there wasn't some truth to what Bronson was spitting, he wouldn't make a six minute video calling him out and spread it all around online himself. Ghost, man, you're one of the best there ever will be. But fronting this hard really just shows how deep in your head the young boys like Bronson coming up at you from behind to take you your spot are. Mad respect, but this is the kind of war you can't win. You smash him and it doesn't mean shit, he's just some up and comer and you're Ghostface motherfucking Killah, of course you made it happen. He smashes you, and kid just took out a legend. He's really got nothing to lose."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,BreadandSalt,65,Mon Jul 20 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"Ghostface has released 2 albums this year already... and one late last year so... yea.  action said he didnt even listen to sour soul, so how the fuck would he know what gfk needs?"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,asdfgtttt,53,Mon Jul 20 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"""Your fans, those are my fans first"" well fuck hes got me there"
hiphopheads,3dyljd,d0t1q,35,Mon Jul 20 17:40:45 2015 UTC,Fucking death threats and all. Damn.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,aagejaeger,9,Mon Jul 20 16:42:59 2015 UTC,Bronson needs to cook him a dinner and all will be good.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,basedgod94,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:25 2015 UTC,Ghost is the only nigga to have a soundtrack to a roasting session lmao
hiphopheads,3dyljd,MF_Doomed,5,Mon Jul 20 18:39:23 2015 UTC,That's really funny to hear the black guy threaten the white guy with a rope
hiphopheads,3dyljd,squfucs,5,Mon Jul 20 19:54:33 2015 UTC,how do you get so mad at someone over the natural sound of their voice?  this has to be one of the dumbest beefs possible
hiphopheads,3dyljd,hreterh,4,Mon Jul 20 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"He's mad because Bronson said ""He's not rapping like this no more"""
hiphopheads,3dyljd,Yasuragi,4,Mon Jul 20 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"Which if we're being honest, he's not. The only similarity I see between Ghostface and Bronson is their fucking voice. Other than that, it's completely different shit they rap about."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,gottaketchum,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:25 2015 UTC,Ghostface at any point in his career is better than Action. Twelve Reasons to Die II is better than Mr. Wonderful. Bronson is wrong to say he's rapping better than Ghost right now.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,fyirb,5,Mon Jul 20 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"""He's not rapping like this no more""   You'd have to be pretty stupid and dense not to see the shade in that sentence."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,ThatCoolBlackGuy,26,Mon Jul 20 19:37:36 2015 UTC,They've been on a track together before and it's not even hard to tell that they're different people.
hiphopheads,3dyljd,RolloTamaci,14,Mon Jul 20 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"He's mad because Bronson said he is not as good anymore, and I guess he took that to mean Bronson thinks he's usurped GFK's place in the rap game."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,YcantweBfrients,7,Mon Jul 20 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they (SN) compared him and Bronson made a quick crack ""He's not rapping like this anymore""  Nothing major, but those hosts made it seem like it was big. They got all riled up."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,bashfulcity,7,Mon Jul 20 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"AT LEAST ACTION BRONSON SHOWS UP TO HIS FUCKING SHOWS, COLUMBUS OH JULY 9TH WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?"
hiphopheads,3dzdsj,Ethanhekker,14,Mon Jul 20 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"SO THIS ISN'T JUST ANY FAN  i mean to Jay it is just some random fan but Rob is one of the most hated guys on hhh twitter. this literally started off a tweet someone made saying ""Which happens first, Rob gets laid or Jay drops his album""  and then Jay roasted Rob  and then Jay started giving him life advice, and then told everyone to follow him. and NOW he's sending him a song.  Rob is one of the most universally hated guys on hhh twitter and now he's literally getting major props from one of the most mysterious rappers in the game."
