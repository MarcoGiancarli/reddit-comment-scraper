accidentalswastika,34oijl,wardrich,3,Sun May 3 05:27:17 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika#Other_East_Asian_traditions  Reading this should explain to some degree why the Swastika can be found quite commonly in Japan without any Nazi connotation. Both versions (the left- and right-faced) have been around for over thousand years there, long long before some German megalomaniac turned the right-faced one into his own symbol. The left-faced one is also used on maps to mark Buddhist tempels, and can be found in all kinds of places. I lived in Japan for a long time and some cities even had it as a symbol on their manhole covers. There is no Nazi meaning behind these cases whatsoever, as it has much older history and tradition there.  EDIT: wording"
accidentalswastika,34oijl,tsbnovil,1 point,Mon May 25 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Section 11. Other East Asian traditions of article  Swastika:       The paired swastika symbols are included, at least since the Liao Dynasty (AD 907–1125), as part of the Chinese writing system (卍 and 卐) and are variant characters for 萬 or 万 (wàn in Mandarin, man in Korean, Cantonese and Japanese, vạn in Vietnamese) meaning ""all"" or ""eternity"" (lit. myriad). The swastika marks the beginning of many Buddhist scriptures. In East Asian countries, the left-facing character is often used as symbol for Buddhism and marks the site of a Buddhist temple on maps.  In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean the swastika is also a homonym of the number 10,000, and is commonly used to represent the whole of Creation, e.g. 'the myriad things' in the Dao De Jing. During the Chinese Tang Dynasty, Empress Wu Zetian (684-704) decreed that the swastika would also be used as an alternative symbol of the Sun.  When the Chinese writing system was introduced to Japan in the 8th century, the swastika was adopted into the Japanese language and culture, with the meaning remained unchanged but slight change on its pronunciation. It is commonly referred as the manji (lit. Man-character). Since the Middle Ages, it has been used as a mon by various Japanese families such as Tsugaru clan, Hachisuka clan or around 60 clans that belong to Tokugawa clan.  On Japanese maps, a swastika (left-facing and horizontal) is used to mark the location of a Buddhist temple. The right-facing manji is often referred to as the gyaku manji (逆卍 ?, lit. ""reverse manji"") or migi manji (右卍 ?, lit. ""right manji""), and can also be called kagi jūji (鉤十字 ?, literally ""hook cross"").

accidentalswastika,2tm6ip,the_unix,6,Sun Jan 25 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"Swastika:       The swastika (also known as the gammadion cross or cross cramponnée) is a symbol that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross, with its four legs bent at 90 degrees (as a Chinese character: 卐 or 卍).   It is considered to be a very sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.   It appears as a decorative element in various cultures since at least the Neolithic, and is mostly known as a symbol in Indian religions, denoting ""auspiciousness"", adopted as such in pre-WWI-Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany. Because of its use in Nazism, in many Western countries the swastika is stigmatized,  while it remains commonly used as a religious symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism.   The word swastika derives from the Sanskrit svastika ""lucky or auspicious object"". The older term gammadion cross derives mainly from its appearance, which is identical to four Greek gamma letters affixed to each other.

There's huge history attached to this symbol and I think people should be more sensitive to what this evokes. Especially in the Hanukkah wrapping paper section of course someone was going to speak up. I don't think enough people are empathetic. I never thought where I grew up (east and west coast Florida) would be so prejudice but there really are many openly antisemitic people. I remember in later years of elementary school through early high school I would constantly get filthy remarks that were just meant to be ""jokes"" I suppose but hearing it from a 10-15 year old kid is really disturbing. I remember asking myself why it's okay for my classmates to call me ""a money grubbing Jew"" but out of line to say nigger. I doubt the graphic designer purposefully put this symbol in the design, but the fact that we look at it and immediately think (swastika, the genocide of millions) should be recognized, and acting upon that isn't being ""politically correct,"" as a commentator put it, but being sensitive and empathetic.  Look at the Boy London logo, I mean what the fuck is that about.."

It's cheap-o wrapping paper for crying out loud. Probably designed in China by someone oblivious to any historical context. It's absurd to call for a product to be removed from a store because of a vaguely similar design. I'm all for cultural sensitivity when it's a blatant example and something that is obviously intentionally offensive, but this is neither here nor there. That's all. This subreddit is tasteless, no doubt, but if we called for the revocation of every item in the sub that would be s little silly, don't you think?

The left-facing variant is favoured in Bön and Gurung Dharma; it is called yungdrung in Bon and Gurung Yantra in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in Hinduism and Buddhism however, the left-facing is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.   In Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha.   In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess Kali.

accidentalswastika,2kf4y2,Mr_Wut8794,2,Tue Oct 28 03:40:38 2014 UTC,"Swastika:       The swastika (also known as the gammadion cross or cross cramponnée) is a symbol that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross, with its four legs bent at 90 degrees (as a Chinese character: 卐 or 卍).    It appears as a decorative element in various cultures since at least the Neolithic, and is mostly known as a symbol in Indian religions, denoting ""auspiciousness"", adopted as such in pre-WWI-Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany. Due to its use in Nazism, in many Western countries the swastika is stigmatized,  while it remains commonly used as a religious symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism.   The word swastika derives from the Sanskrit svastika ""lucky or auspicious object"". The older term gammadion cross derives from its appearance, which is identical to four Greek gamma letters affixed to each other.

accidentalswastika,2k5i4y,Mitchekers,12,Sat Oct 25 21:11:53 2014 UTC,I learned in high school that the swastika had a history with buddhism. I started drawing elaborate ones in doodles and even got one published in the school art magazine. Some teachers thought there was something wierd about me.
accidentalswastika,2k5i4y,wirednyte,2,Fri Oct 24 02:25:00 2014 UTC,The image captioned:   One of the supporters of the Learn to Love the Swastika movement   I'm still unsure whether that comment was intended to be ironic

The architect might have been a Nazi sympathizer.  Source: From Helsinki. Lots of similar buildings around here date around that time period."
