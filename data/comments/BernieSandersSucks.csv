This article makes fun of Bernie for being scared of nuclear bombs in the 70s, it was the fucking cold war, everyone was scared especially the capitalist"
BernieSandersSucks,3dkgbm,Hugepepino,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"The article speaks many truths. Everybody already knows socialism and communism have very little that separates the ideologies. But hardcore leftists always play the game, e.g. Fascism wasn't socialism even though they were the National Socialist Party. Besides, they weren't making fun of Bernie as much as they are appalled at his stupidity."
BernieSandersSucks,3dkgbm,neckbeards4bernie,3,Fri Jul 17 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly no Bernie Sanders supporter but you are seriously mixed up with these claims that fascism and socialism are nearly synonymous.   they were the National Socialist Party   That is an English-language term coined by the English-language press in the 1920s, a somewhat sloppy translation of Nationalsozialismus. Nationalsozialismus incorporates the German concept of Volksgemeinschaft, or a society led by all German peoples. Nationalsozialismus was both anti-socialist and anti-capitalist. It was also pro-business, pro-private property, and anti-collective bargaining, the exact opposite of socialist perspectives on these three issues. That's why when Jewish-owned businesses and property were seized, they were given to or sold to people and businesses and not held by the state, as would have occurred with socialism. Labor unions were broken up in Nazi Germany and union activists -- often socialists -- were imprisoned or executed.  Hitler regularly and repeatedly denounced socialism, communism, Marxism, and Bolshevism. He continuously preached that socialism and Judaism were intertwined and that anti-Semitic action was necessary to stomp out socialism."
BernieSandersSucks,3dkgbm,Hugepepino,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"Listen, lefties burp out the same schtick every time. The rest of us know the truth.

""It's so much more complex than that and so uniquely different."" Blah"
BernieSandersSucks,3dkgbm,Hugepepino,3,Fri Jul 17 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"No, socialism and communism are different. Would you really compare modern socialist Europe to ussr, Interchangeably. That's why we have two different words. That's right typical bullshit. Just as I could call conservatives fascist because it's more that direction but I'd be just as wrong. I ain't worried about Bernie being made fun of, I am worried about the argument. Once you mix up socialism and communism you lose credibility, that's just mudslinging. Obviously the guy ain't scared of labels, if they were the same thing he probably would be calling himself that"

Did you notice that clown Mayor of NYC de Blasio is a Sanders fanatic? Great endorsement if you ask me. The guy tried to shut down the Charter schools, which help the low income and minorities more than anyone else, and his approach to law enforcement has given way to a huge rise in crime. He used to say ""black lives matter"" but now he says that the murders don't matter because most of them are (black) criminals anyways!"

At around 24m30s Bernie flat-out lies and claims that women are making 78 cents on the dollar when compared to men for the same work. What makes these morons think he's an honest politician?

One difference between then and now is I can actually see Bernie making some real noise in the primaries and at least winning some states.
