ABCDesis,3e3ypm,thestinkypig,5,Tue Jul 21 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"""Texts come with contexts and interpretations and it’s possible to take what speaks to me and let go of the rest""   Is that a traditional Islamic interpretation?"
ABCDesis,3e3ypm,asdfioho,4,Tue Jul 21 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, kind of. There's the concept of ijtihad which means ""independent reasoning"", though traditionally many contend only a scholar is capable of doing so. Taqlid is a concept that one should rely on a learned person and the consensus of scholars. However, the Qu'ran and Prophetic tradition warns of blindly following authority & tradition, and even positive institutions can be ingrained with normative values that go against the canon of Islamic values (we see this during and after the Prophet's lifetime, where even new/""good"" Muslims have difficulty adjusting to the overturning of cultural norms e.g. attitudes women being a famous one)."
ABCDesis,3e3ypm,K_M_H_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting!  I meant to ask from genuine curiousity. On the one hand, I've heard Islam is one of the most text-driven out of all religions. On the other, the fact that Sufis had such a huge influence and were widely tolerated perplexes me with that other statement."
ABCDesis,3e3ypm,asdfioho,2,Wed Jul 22 01:31:35 2015 UTC,"That's because you're viewing it as a dichotomy: while of course local traditions, folk religion, and the like have melded with Sufism to create syncretic or superstitious practices that have no basis in traditional Islam or may contradict it, the root of Sufism is orthodox. I come from a Sufi household (Naqshbandiyaa), and for what's it worth, most of them I know engage in mysticism without straying from the text. They're not at odds with each other by nature. Take the famous Ghazali, rigorous defender and revitalizer of orthodox Islam, who engaged in practices we may now call Sufi. Jasser Auda, a fantastic modern scholar, who has written on legal philosophy and Islam, has also devoted study to extolling the virtues of Sufism."
ABCDesis,3e3ypm,K_M_H_,2,Wed Jul 22 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"the root of Sufism is orthodox   This is what I was wondering exactly, thanks for clearing it up. I know Sufis are a big part of Punjab's Islamic heritage, but that's recently been thrown out of the window in favor of the Wahabbi interpretation.   Just curious, what about Bulleh Shah? His practices were very divergent from what many would consider Islam (i.e., what you may find in /r/islam), but he's revered among Punjabi Sufis.   Also, thanks for the comprehensive answer. I'm pretty religious as a Sikh myself, and while I think some of the typical ""orthodox"" answers are completely missing the mark and I disagree with them vehemently, I'm also apprehensive of people fudging the religion to fit what modern liberals think."
ABCDesis,3e3ypm,asdfioho,9,Wed Jul 22 02:15:15 2015 UTC,Tell that to the folks on /r/Islam who had a debate on the ethics of stoning homosexuals.  I can't tell what's sadder - the parochial mindset some people have towards gays or the self-hate some gays have for themselves.

When I said raised Muslim I meant I had the usual solid fundamentals taught to me by my parents when I was young and now that I'm older I'm a bit more loose in my faith. However, at no point did my parents ever tell me that making others uncomfortable with your words was appropriate, and they added that to obsess over the tiniest of things was counterproductive of Islam as a way of life.  Whether it be arguments over Shias, homosexuals, interfaith dating, and other things, r/islam seems to become a very weird place. It is only God's role to judge his subjects, no one else's. I don't know why some people take issues that barely affect them so closely to heart, and then in the process they end up typing things that just make me, like I said, scratch my head. Let God do his work, and focus on being the best person you can meanwhile."

I understand the whole 'live and let live' but that has its limits in the Islamic context as the people have a societal obligation.  As for homosexuality, it is very clear what the Islamic opinion is on that, so posters can get slightly impatient with people who use Islam to justify acts it clearly forbids."

My background is Pakistani.   Currently, a student in my last year of undergraduate studies, inshaAllah.   My parents are also native Texans, so I was the whitewashed one amid my Desi friends. That gave way to a huge cultural disconnect. I didn't speak the language, and wasn't familiar with the culture and/or expectations to appreciate/understand the struggles of my friends. Like it was so weird to me that their parents were restrictive of them (on the basis of being girls) but gave their brothers carte blanche freedom. So I really felt like the odd one out all through high school. When I found this subreddit, it was such a eureka moment for my teenage self, haha. It's nice to read the experiences and thoughts of so many people with similar backgrounds.   Hobbies...  I love to read. Stacks and stacks of books. I'll pretty much read anything with the exception of most modern fiction. This takes up the majority of my time outside of school.   Photography. Getting my feet wet by playing around with a camera, it's been a rewarding experience to slow down and look at my surroundings a little more carefully.   Writing.

ABCDesis,3e2tow,The_Hermione_Granger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the warm welcome :)   Two recent favorites... Frankenstein by Mary Shelly, just because of the way the writing reflected so much of the author's life. The Creature was particularly touching, too. He sought connection and companionship, not so differently from humans. Yet because of his gruesome appearance, he was shunned. At the onset of his creation, he was innocent and loving, and through his bitter experiences, he hardened over.   A Farewell to Arms by Hemingway broke my heart. The entire writing style is a salute to the main character's pain as he describes his time as a solider in active war-time, a whirlwind romance that humanized him, and incredible loss. The story was told after the tragedy, and the hazy/dream-like style of writing kinda reflected the way the main character wistfully looked back at his experiences."

ABCDesis,3e2tow,K_M_H_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:47:33 2015 UTC,Sunsets and my youngest brother.
ABCDesis,3e2tow,pakistanimsmarvel,4,Wed Jul 22 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm a 20-year-old Pakistani chick living in the UK, studying Sociology and Politics at uni. It's nice to see other NRdesis on the internet. I adore Kamala, and 90% of the reason I'm here is because she's on the banner.   I feel kinda disconnected from my heritage, and I feel like I exist in this liminal space w/r/t what I identify as ethnically/nationally. I'm hoping that /r/ABCDesis can help me a little bit."
ABCDesis,3e2tow,K_M_H_,4,Tue Jul 21 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Heya! Liminal is such a great word. As is ephemeral. Cool diction aside, welcome to the sub!  Kamala's awesome! She's kinda like the Desi Peter Parker type I always wanted to see. Though, ngl, the latest arc saddened me (A Desi Muslim getting a romantic interest that's awesome but also from a similar heritage? Knew it was too good to be true). But it was powerful in its own right with regard to analogies of deeper betrayal and so forth. Hope they don't push a romance with Bruno, though. Hate the trope of all good guy/girl friendships must steer towards amour."
ABCDesis,3e2tow,pakistanimsmarvel,2,Tue Jul 21 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"Liminal is an awesome word, and I'm trying to use it more often.  Honestly, I kinda knew from the moment the solicits came out that it wouldn't end well, 'cause they really are setting up Bruno for love interest (which... meh. I'd prefer Robbie Reyes or Miles Morales myself.)"
ABCDesis,3e2tow,K_M_H_,3,Tue Jul 21 22:52:15 2015 UTC,"See, I worried about the romance angle from the beginning of the series, 'cause like, there are brown kids who go HS without dating, stick to their roots or faith or what have you, sometimes due to pressure, but sometimes voluntarily. Which I always found cool because hey, Desi or Muslim or what have you courtship rituals and modes of love are just as valid as 'Western' style dating. Doesn't make you weird or repressed or etc. So I was always rooting for Kamala not to be normalized/assimilated in that sense. Because there's more to a young person's life than the struggle for a bae, y'know? Gah, I'm rambling. But we'll see.  I love Miles so much! But Bendis never did him justice imo. What I loved about Ult Spidey was that, much of the time, it was a teen drama with superheroes thrown in. With Miles, it's a bombardment of major event after major event with no reprieve, and I would've loved to see more mundane aspects of his life, his interests, etc develop. Hopefully things will be more paced out following Secret Wars.  Are you a DC gal at all or nah?"
ABCDesis,3e2tow,ds_wannabe,2,Tue Jul 21 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"I kind of knew that she would be more Westernised than the average brown Muslim kid, because Marvel would not place so much on a more conservative Muslim desi superhero - I mean, the only ones are Dust from the X-Men, who was this weird Orientalist unintentional caricature of desi/Arab/Muslim women, and Excalibur, who's great, but who also ends up in a romance with the plucky white boy. I hope as the series goes on it can start to explore a diasporic Pakistani identity, not just a Muslim identity, that's a little less superficial than it is currently.  That might be too much for a lighthearted comic though, idk  I have literally no idea where to start with DC, because I'm not really into Batgirl, which seemed like the obvious starting point. I read ""Whatever Happened  to the Caped Crusader?"" though, and very much enjoyed it."
ABCDesis,3e2tow,shwey,2,Tue Jul 21 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"Dust was great, save for the weird Othering tropes you accurate described being projected onto her. I have the same contention with Faiza, but I do love her (cross-over where her and Nightrunner, the Muslim Batman of France, elope, tho). It would be cool if Miles own racialization (and his Puerto Rican heritage) was also explored in a meaningful sense.  One can only hope, I guess.  I really adore the old Batgirls, Stephanie Brown (working-class firecracker gal, teen mother, father was a villain), and Cassandra Cain (Asian, also raised to be a villain, initially mute). Their dynamic with each other and the rest of the Batfam was great. WHTTCC was one of my first comics haha (still have it in a cover), and I adore it. You could try reading Grant Morrison's run through graphic novels (Batman & The Black Glove, Batman & Son) which culminate in the epic Batman RIP (I skipped the former, and refreshed myself on wiki to read RIP). Batman & Robin where the first Robin-turned-Nightwing, the affable Dick Grayson is Batman, and Bruce's murderous grumpy son Damian Wayne is Robin, has to be one of my favourite arcs, inversing the traditional dynamic of the pair."

He's very well respected at his work. All this in spite of coming from a not so well to do family.  He told me he had to study in a temple because his house didn't have electricity.   The story of my paternal grandparents is also pretty amazing, I'll try to find a pic of theirs. My paternal grandfather actually belonged to a very rich zamindari type family in Kerala, but he ended up marrying a Tamilian when he was deployed. This was during WW II, so him marrying someone of another state and a caste was enough reason for my great grand parents to disown him and leaving him almost penniless.   They moved to Tamil Nadu, lived in a very poor neighborhood that produced a lot of criminals, but they raised my dad and his brother to be very respected members of the society.

ABCDesis,3dwvi0,Anandya,6,Mon Jul 20 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"This could have gone better but turned out to be yet another angst-y, confused piece of writing.   Who the hell is a non-Black South Asian? Or even more importantly, who'll be a Black South Asian unless he's mixed? Also, Haley might be passing but Jindal is not. Nobody will look at him and go, ""there goes a White man"", nor has he ever tried to hide his Indian origins.   Their politics might have racist agendas but why does their ethnic origin mean that every South Asian has to be sorry for those people's choices? There are Black politicians who vehemently deny racism or ask Black people to ""take responsibility"", whatever that means. That doesn't put any onus on other Black people to acknowledge their self-hatred or something.  People are individuals with complex incentives and feelings. Identities are great for identifying problems and solutions for groups of people but that doesn't mean every person is only his/her identity and nothing else. Maybe I should assign the author's feelings to her support of the caste system which denied individuality and sought to impose uniformity throughout the group."
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,akbar-great_chai-tea,5,Mon Jul 20 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, I think the author's arguing:   there's a long complicated history of Desis trying to pass as white, or supporting white supremacy through direct or indirect means Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley have succeeded in part because they use whiteness, and don't challenge white supremacy when Desis push back against Haley or Jindal's policies, we sometimes fail to claim them as one of ours but it's not OK to say ""well, they're not really Desi"" — Haley and Jindal's views are rooted in our community   For me, this is the key sentence:   ""We need to claim Nikki Haley, and Tanned Rested & Ready Bobby Jindal, whether or not they claim us. They are not only part of our community; they exemplify the parts of our communities that we would rather hide.""   Why is this argument relevant? I read this as a response to the #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite hashtag.  The author's basically arguing that pushing the problem away doesn't make it disappear, because ""Bobby Jindal is basically white"" is a no true Scotsman argument.  Instead, the author argues that Jindal and Haley are Desi, and some of the things they do have a long history, so we should talk about it."
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,akbar-great_chai-tea,3,Mon Jul 20 15:28:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand and agree with the sentiment that Haley and Jindal have done something that many Indians already do in other circumstances.  I didn't read #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite as ""he's not Indian"" but as spoof of his tendency to go to excruciating lengths to paint himself as an ""ordinary"" (read White) American, like how he is not a hyphenated American. The joke is, no matter what he thinks of himself, he will always be different from the majority population.  Plenty of immigrant groups, from the Irish to the Italians to the Jews, have co-opted White supremacy and fought to be considered White rather than fight White supremacy. They were all minorities and this was a path to social mobility for them. Even if I don't personally believe in it, I am not going to be pissed off at South Asians who do this simply because we are not White, we don't have the social capital of Whiteness and we are still fighting our own battles. Heck, feminism has done this throughout the last century and continues to do this even today, co-opting White supremacy to make their own positions stronger."
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,desidandconfused,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"when Desis push back against Haley or Jindal's policies, we sometimes fail to claim them as one of ours   When I push back against Haley or Jindal, I do so because I'm a right-wing conservative acutely aware of how they can make conservative policies look incredible (and I do mean not credible) to the political mainstream by wrapping them up in the social policy red-meat that they believe their constituencies (admittedly, in the South) will lap up.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/opinion/bobby-jindal-im-holding-firm-against-gay-marriage.html?_r=0  I'm pretty conservative: low taxes, minimal safety net, pro-gun, strong national defense, less regulatory bullshit, etc.  But the social side of things; would Piyush Jindal have been someone who supported that, or does Bobby Jindal support it because that's what his faith tells him to do?  (Not saying there isn't anti-gay sentiment among Hindus, or that his conversion wasn't sincere, I'm just saying, how much is he supposed to be ""mine"" because we have similar genetics when it comes to skin and hair color)"

I used to be sympathetic to Bhagat Singh Thind, and I guess I kind of still am because of the injustice he faced. But reading his court case honestly kind of disgusted me. One of the arguments his lawyers made was that he was a ""high caste Hindu"" (note this means Hindu as a racial classification as ordained by the British) who also accepted racial hierarchies just as much as the white man. In fact, the court case glorified anti-black racism specifically."
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,INDY_Punjabi,5,Mon Jul 20 11:21:33 2015 UTC,"And Thind wasn't alone. Many early South Asian immigrants/visitors would apparently describe themselves as high caste — and ""high caste Hindoo"" was also a term frequently used as in the American media as a kind of class signifier to separate the ""good"" ones from the ""bad"" ones. A few examples:   1887: Pundita Ramabai's The High Caste Hindu Woman 1906: ""Mr. Bonnarjoe Is born of a highest caste Hindoo family…"" 1908: ""High Caste Mohammedans and Mexicans Struggle to Explain Their Cases Through the Aid of Interpreters"" 1918: ""Dr. Bishen Singh Mittui, high caste Hindoo…"" 1919: ""Lady Thackeray, a high caste Hindoo woman…"""
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,INDY_Punjabi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"This probably stems from the British taking the caste system very seriously, offering perks to those that were higher caste over others, along with them theorizing that higher caste individuals were fairer skinned, which resonated well with their white supremacist world view at that time.   I think it makes sense in the context of the time period for someone like Thind, who is trying to gain citizenship in a foreign Western country, to use arguments that would appeal to Westerners and therefore bolster his case in their view."
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,INDY_Punjabi,6,Tue Jul 21 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"1) it can be argued that Governor Haley basically isn't even Punjabi or indian or Indian American. She married outside of thr community, changed her name, purports herself to be white, has little to do with the community beyond engaging in vote bank politics.   2) Dylan Roof is not Indian American. Guess what?  He's white. He has nothing to do with us. I don't even need to go into detail on this point on how we aren't culpable here.   3)  So what some early Indo Americans tried to trade up in regards to race. What else would you have done if you were an early immigrabt to an intensely racist country. Also, guess what?  Black people themselves do it to this day:  they emphasised the difference between field slaves and house slaves, blacks who are lighter skinned are more esteemed in rhe community than their dark skinned counterparts.   4) to be clear, what Dylan did was horrible. It effects us ALL as a community. But, are Indians/Desis in anyway responsible for what happened?  I shout this: F No!!!!!  5) you can downvote me all you want. You will still be wrong. But, I would encourage a convo.   Edit:  deleted my insentive use of the t word. It was disrespectful to /u/anirvan.

ABCDesis,3dwvi0,INDY_Punjabi,4,Mon Jul 20 15:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think your first point is the key question. And depending on how the question's framed, I know I can fall on either side of the issue:   Should every Muslim be personally held to account for a small number of right-wing Muslim assholes? Hell, no. But should Desis talk about domestic violence when we read about notorious abusers like Gurbaksh Chahal (even if he's not actively involved in our community)? Hell, yes.   The #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite hashtag was more of a #1 argument — Desis saying ""we don't like you, you're not one of us, and we're visibly pushing you out.""  The author of this piece is making more of a #2 argument — the things we don't like about Haley or Jindal are present in our community, and it's important that we talk about it.  That's not quite the same thing as collective responsibility or finger-pointing.  (Just like if Gurbaksh Chahal's in the news for beating up women, every Desi man doesn't need to write a letter of apology, but it can still be an opening for some conversations.)"
ABCDesis,3dwvi0,paxtanaa,4,Mon Jul 20 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Should every Muslim be personally held to account for a small number of right-wing Muslim assholes? Hell, no.    I agree. I coincidentally referenced thus same analogy on a different thread.     But should Desis talk about domestic violence when we read about notorious abusers like Gurbaksh Chahal (even if he's not actively involved in our community)? Hell, yes.    Domestic violence may be a more appropriate topic. It's more prevalent in this community. And, we have lackadaisical attitufes towards it. Not sure how it applies to the south carolina slaughter by extension.   The consistent theme of what I have been saying iver the past week is this: blacks have it rough. As americans, we all have to do a better job of uplifting our black brothers and sisters. Thats just one minor example (we have to do the same for gays, illegals, etc)    So, we agree on the most important things.   Where we specifically disagree is in the notion thay our ""desi-nedd"" is somehow related to all of this.   It's not.   Dylan roof is white, all of his supporters are white, the confederate flag people are white, the guy who sold him the gun is white.   There is no Brown, aside from Haley, in this equation.   Go into any mandir, gurudwara, masjid, Indian Christian church, indian american home...etc...and not a single one is contributing to the murders or oppression of African Americans.   I absolutely cant say the same about their white counterparts, the lefislature of the US, and various legislatures of its States."

African-American & Black Muslims who brought Islam to America and to this day continue to face the brunt of both anti-blackness and Islamophobia. Palestinian Muslims navigating apartheid, bearing occupation, and dealing with the IDF's bloodbaths every few years. Muslims from all over these regions and more who have become refugees.

ABCDesis,3dwjby,CisternaChyli,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"With that logic, Israel isn't a state either. The British people carved out out of an existing territory   I'm surprised people are being down voted for not supporting Israel. Where ya'll folks hiding? If you support Israel cause of India's military ties, know that there isn't anything Israel has that we can't buy from Russia or NATO. We're very fortunate to have good ties with both superpowers.

ABCDesis,3dwjby,x6tance,4,Tue Jul 21 03:12:04 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your logic as to why Israel isn't a state. Sure it may have been carved out, but it was recognized by the UN (hell the UN was the one who made the partition plan). Now, the UN has also recognized the Palestinian territories as a State, which only happened recently. Prior to 1967, that territory was being controlled by Egypt and Jordan.   Here is the big reason to support Israel; they aren't calling for the destruction of Muslims or other religions (like what the Islamic extremists want). Before someone tries to take this discussion over to Iran, Israel doesn't want to get rid of Iran (unlike what Iran's leaders have been saying for decades now vis a vis Israel), just their nuclear program. Israel isn't perfect, far from it, but I'd rather throw my lot in with them then the surrounding Arab countries for the most part. Israel is the only democratic country in the region as well."

I think it was very thorough and well done. The British had, for the longest time, assumed that since the colonies weren't up to the standards they saw as hallmarks of civilization (which was in reality Western-centric), that it was their duty as the ""enlightened conquerer"" to add it to the colonies. To do this, they also somewhat subverted the history of South Asia for their purposes. And of course, they sapped significant resources from their colonies while their own GDP grew far and beyond. This view permeates a lot of history books, which is why many still paint pre-British India as some chaotic anarchy (far from the case). But I think many academics are picking up on this innovative way of looking at the British Empire--perhaps their perception of themselves as ""enlightened"" added to the damage they caused.  I do think, though, that many reactionary ideologies found in South Asia rely on colonization as a tool to manipulate the history (similar to the tactics the British used) and that there's a lot of misinformation. For example, the whole argument that ""caste totally wasn't a thing the British just invented it,"" eh, tell that to Bhagat Ravidas, Bhaktic cults, or the Sikh Gurus. I know that in modern ""Sikh studies,"" a lot of anti-imperialist scholars are SO against Sikh reform movements because they popped up in the British period and were at times aided by the British or Western education that they ignore the priority of genuine concerns those reform movements had with how contemporary yet ""native"" Sikhi had strayed from the teachings of the original Khalsa and Sikh ideology (for example, idolatry and caste discrimination in Harimandir Sahib).   I also don't necessarily agree with all the conclusions he makes, but A) I think this is a great resource nonetheless B) I'm not in a mood to argue too much C) I think many on this sub think my recent comments make me out to be a loyal sepoy so I think I'll just leave it at that"
ABCDesis,3dv8u3,asdfioho,0,Mon Jul 20 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"pre-British India as some chaotic anarchy   Might be since in many parts of South India, women were topless, and people bathed casually naked. In addition, they probably saw eating with our hands as uncivilized amongst many other things that probably found strange.   ""caste totally wasn't a thing the British just invented it,""   It is ours. IDK why they are blaming the Brits. It has become random blaming. Although on must admit that many culturally conservative things came from them. The caste system today is nothing like how it was in the Vedas. Caste was merely a title of profession really. Untouchability became a cultural thing rather than religious. Many say that this rose when groups shunned people who were unclean from society as cleanliness used to be super important.   caste discrimination in Harimandir Sahib   Wait, Sikhs have castes?

ABCDesis,3dv8u3,Anandya,7,Mon Jul 20 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is a lot of Indians promote instead the opposite. A view of the past as a near mystical paradise.   There is something interesting you should know.   Part of the dialogue about rubbishing Indian achievements was simply eliminating Indian culture. So... the Arabs call the decimalised system as Hindu Numbers. We didn't get the credit for it. Variolation was first found in India. No credit for it, Jenner DOES take credit for vaccination but its predecessor was pretty damn smart too.   Hell? A lot of people who are into swords laud things like the Katana but forget that one of the best swords at draw cuts was not the Katana which is a very expensive sword and a near piece of art because it took highly inferior steel and painstakingly made it into a sword... By contrast Indians had to use better steel so didn't need to faff about with it being an art. This was designed to kill and kill in a specific way. They even designed the handle to teach the user if he used it the wrong way. If you didn't know to use a sword and you used a turkish or an arab one you may not do as much damage. The Indian one would do more. The handle FORCES the user to use the more damaging cut.   SO... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuU3jCfmNv4  Yeah there are videos of pigs simply being cut in half with a one handed sword (remember the Katana is a two handed sword and needs way more power to use and is just as ineffective against armour despite what TV shows us!) But then why aren't we discussing about magic indian swords? By all accounts Indian swords themselves that predate the firangi (foreign) period were all works of art. In fact it is a lost art. We don't know to make the steels used. The closest we have is twisting different types of steel and forging from that. It's literally a ""we don't know"" how this was made. But no one in India or abroad apart from some complete history nutters and people who are interested in South Asian history know about this.   And a big reason as to why this may be the case is that the knowledge was simply not regarded as valuable as it came from barbarians.   The caste system is poison though. I am glad it is falling and it should die out. You may not be aware that even Christians and Muslims have caste discrimination. I am afraid caste has become cultural. Then again, human nature isn't it. We will always find a way to discriminate against someone who doesn't meet the standard of ""cool"". Be it in a school or in society as a whole.   There is no way to pay for reparations. There is no physical way to return the wealth taken from India. It is gone. However some acceptance of that is necessary. It's a tragedy and ignoring the role of the UK in it allows people to forget how blind thought can lead to atrocities."

Punjabi gangs in Canada are also ""proud"" that white people are scared of them and don't call them names to their face anymore; too bad they do that by acting like uncivilized baboons and acting in a manner that brings shame to Punjabis across the world. Yes, be proud that we are making whites suffer with sexual grooming, gang violence, and violent religious conservatives. The best route of ""karmic"" payback is to do to the British what we criticize them doing to us.  I started at this sub as someone completely naive to my own space in America's racial structure (i.e., subservient to the white hierarchy, proud of being a model minority, ""blacks are just suffering cuz they don't work as hard as white people,"" and so on), but I admit I gained a ton of awareness and become an advocate of us speaking out, of us being openly proud of whatever identities we have and choosing to stand up to authority on that ground. Recently though, I've seen this pushed to such an extreme that it just manifests in blatant hatred for white people. A bizarre anti-orientalism (as /u/K_M_H_ put it) where ""Indian"" society was pure and all good until those pesky whites brought everything negative to it. It's a horribly reductive view, and as a Desi minority it's frankly really fucking scary and troublesome to watch."

Can't you see the growing radicalization of Islamic youth in Britain, the growing use of Sharia courts there, the oppressive treatment of women in their communities? Or are you in denial that all of this even exists?  If they exist, all I am saying is that it's karmic (in the sense tit for tat) that once the British invaded countries and made the locals suffer their Victorian (or whatever) culture against their wishes. And now they are being overrun by people of different countries and forced to endure their cultures and mores whether they like it or not. And it appears, most do not.  That's it.

""Sadly, enough generations have transpired to now observe the whole colonization as a wistful memory. I can only assume that the onslaught of immigrants into the UK is just a karmic payback, and watching them squirm and suffer under the new order that is slowly taking root can only be a mirror of what they did to the colonies.""  If I have to summarize what I thought...""Dang, too bad our youngsters are forgetting what dem damn Brits did to us. Well, it's all good, hehehe, these fuckers are getting what they deserve with all these terrible practices immigrants are bringing to them."" Karmic most often implies a sense of righteousness, often; didn't know you meant it in the other context.   I still think comparing the two incidents is problematic, lacks nuance, and falls right into the hands of what anti-immigrant lobbies would have people believe."
ABCDesis,3dv8u3,SabashChandraBose,6,Mon Jul 20 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"Why, of course, I am livid at what the ""dem Brits"" did to us. From cursorily glancing at your comment history, it appears you are of Sikh heritage. Have you forgotten the bloodshed that resulted during the Partition? Have you forgotten the reason for the Partition? (edit: Jallianwala Bagh Massacre?)  Why is the West, especially America and most of Europe, so sensitive to Israel? Because of the injustice its people suffered under the Nazis, right? And that is somehow a more easy pill to swallow than the genocide the ""dem Brits"" themselves committed in India? Or do you not know about the Bengal Famine of 1943?  Are you trying to condone the atrocities committed against some in your own family who might have suffered? Maybe you are roaming the vast badlands of your own Canadian-Indian roots and have come up with your own theories.  But facts remain.  I never said anything about halting immigration. Let those who can legally immigrate, do so. Let them assimilate the laws of the land and be in harmony with the natives. I am all for that. Britain purportedly came up with a remarkable judicial system that they seem to be quite content with. Let them apply their rules to people illegally entering their country. I have no qualms in that. Let them police their own borders and do what it takes to keep it safe.  But I will not deny the schadenfreude I feel when I see them worrying about what is happening to their cities which seem to be suddenly overrun with immigrants. It's not that they didn't have millions worrying about the same thing a century ago."
ABCDesis,3dv8u3,asdfioho,0,Mon Jul 20 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"Have you forgotten the bloodshed that resulted during the Partition? Have you forgotten the reason for the Partition?   Starting off, there's no doubt that colonial rule created this situation where right wing religious movements in Punjab developed and eventually culminated in the mess that was Partition. No doubt that the Partition itself had a lot of bloodshed that could have been prevented had the British extended the services they used to protect their own folk to the entire Punjab populace. But while the former is an explanation on a greater intellectual framework, it's very hard to actually parse away blame from the people themselves. The Muslim League wanted the Partition of India. The Akalis lobbied for the Partition of Punjab after conflict with Muslims in the West, and just like Muslim mobs murdered thousands in the West, armed Sikh bands were merciless in their ethnic cleansing of Muslims. Doubtless that the historical factors that led Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus to this result wouldn't have existed without colonial rule, but the violence cannot be completely absolved from the people themselves unless you consider them puppets with no agency.  BTW, the Indian nation-state (also a colonial product in some ways) hasn't been a saint in how it has broken promises to the Sikhs and murdered much more than Jallianwala Bagh. I'm no doubt in favor of the Indian nation-state than India the colony, but Indian nationalists end up using ""so what the British were worse"" as a complete clutch to avoid critical analysis of what goes on in their own country.   And that is somehow a more easy pill to swallow than the genocide the ""dem Brits"" themselves committed in India? Or do you not know about the Bengal Famine of 1943?   https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/3dpbdx/unspoken_story_of_indian_holocaust_uk_remains/ct81r2o?context=3  So...yes? I get that you feel the need to compare colonialism to Nazism in order to illicit an emotional response, but its ahistorical and absolute nonsense. Read some actual books on the subject outside of what the nationalists will have you think. Remember that the British too used this tactic of hyping up the Mughals to all be some bloody monsters in order to more easily justify their presence.    Are you trying to condone the atrocities committed against some in your own family who might have suffered? Maybe you are roaming the vast badlands of your own Canadian-Indian roots and have come up with your own theories.   Not really. I've seen though, as a minority within modern India, that (shocker) despite the country not being run by white people anymore, the colonial mindset hasn't fully left and the types of power structures have shifted to India's ruling class. But I leave that for another day.  Obviously I'm anti-colonialist. The historical record speaks for itself as to why. Read more into the historical record, though, and you'll find that wonderful thing known as nuance. Modern Indians in many ways define their identity solely from anti-colonialism (since the post-colonial period is the main one where the Indian state developed as a united identity) and tend to fudge the history a bit to support that, just like you've done with comparing the Bengal Famine to the holocaust.    But I will not deny the schadenfreude I feel when I see them worrying about what is happening to their cities which seem to be suddenly overrun with immigrants. It's not that they didn't have millions worrying about the same thing a century ago.   Thanks for being honest with what I was saying earlier and that you were denying. It's again this disgusting us vs them mentality that relies on painting all white people as solely related to colonizers. I wonder, what you would have said if I said I similarly derived pleasure from seeing certain Sikhs gunning down Hindus in buses in the Punjab just like how ""they"" Hindus had burned Sikhs alive in Delhi.   Your ""pleasure"" is probably also misplaced considering that if the average Briton galvanizes strongly enough against the immigrants, they can be pushed out. It took quite some time for the entire South Asian community to work for a common goal against the British, and that too wasn't really fully realized as the greatest anti-colonial ""revolutionary"" was in reality WWII."

However, Chiwetel Ejiofor (of 12 Years a Slave and Kinky Boots) is pretty great, and I would be more annoyed if the actor were white. Still though, v annoying.  There have been, unfortunately, plenty of similar situations. The first that comes to mind received a lot of media attention: In Aloha, Emma Stone, who is v white, was cast as a half-Hawaiian, half-Asian girl. In the Hunger Games books, main character Katniss Everdeen is described as having ""olive skin"" and ""dark hair"" and minor character Finnick Odair has ""tan skin"", which really would have been a fantastic opportunity for actors of color. But no. In the movie adaptation, both are played by white actors. The casting call for Katniss even specified ""Caucasian"". The Last Airbender, another adaptation, many of the Inuit and Asian characters are played by white actors.  It's called whitewashing, and it is rampant in Hollywood. Of course, this doesn't apply directly to your situation, but it does apply in that whitewashing leads to erasure of minorities. Black people are more visible than brown people. Casting a black person in a ""brown person role"" limits opportunities for brown actors and erases one of the few cases we even show up in stories.

Hindu philosophy, which emphasizes female divinity and respect for women, has historically been progressive when addressing issues of sex and gender, though many Hindus struggle to put that into practice. As a result, many middle-class Hindu families have embraced colonial-era standards about sex and refuse to bring it up in the public sphere. Meanwhile, most Christian schools - where many middle and upper-class Indians send their children - do not have sex education, and Islamic education centers still tend to enforce certain gender norms that make it difficult for women to get an open space. With that being said, Indian social justice activists of all religious traditions have pushed for greater discussions about sex and sexual violence in public discourse, an effort that has unfortunately received quite a bit of resistance from policymakers.   This is the thing that makes me so sad as a Hindu! Total destruction of Hindu ideals!"
ABCDesis,3du8wf,brucelee-royjenkins,8,Sun Jul 19 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"I mean...what are Hindu ideals? I'm obviously speaking from a place of ignorance here because while I consider myself Hindu, I haven't delved too deeply into Hindu thought.   As far as I know most Hindu practices have been steadily changed through centuries of invasions and the like - how are we to know what constituted the original practices, unless we delve into academics (that are subject to their own interpretations)?"
ABCDesis,3du8wf,asdfioho,4,Sun Jul 19 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"original practices are CLEARLY laid out in hindu scripture.  Things like puranas, uppanishads and vedas are the best bet.  For higher level understanding you can use Brahma Sutras.  When people always ask, okay, you're hindu, what's your bible or bible equivalent? Most people are unable to answer or they say things like Gita/Mahabharata or Ramayana.  While those serve a purpose, one can not compare them as a ""bible"" if they are considered epics.  The Jerusalem based religions don't understand what they are cause there is nothing comparable to an epic in their background.  The Gita should only be looked at as a small synopsis of the vedas and a good start to begin the journey of understanding of santana dharma.  You have to remember that ""Hinduism"" is an evolved term used by westerners to describe the people of the Indus value that were living a life of santana dharma rather than calling them a specific name.    Temples did not come until 3rd century AD.  If you notice concepts like idol worship don't exist in the 2 major epics.  If you date them to the proper time when they were recited and written on pottery and leaves, then you can date how certain traditions and ways of life came into the mix and blended culture with religion.  Things like mythological stories, rituals, bhajans and all are all recent before in the grand scheme of things and do not work as a way to describe a religion from more than 5,000 years ago"
ABCDesis,3du8wf,brucelee-royjenkins,4,Sun Jul 19 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"There is no CLEAR laying down of any practices. Puranas differ with each other on many ideas because they were written by different people during different times at different places. There are other books like Sutras which differ widely even when written in the same era at the same place.  There is no Hindu equivalent of The Bible because Hinduism is not a written, book-centred religion. There is no mandate that every religion has to follow that format. Also, Gita is not a synopsis of the Vedas nor are the Vedas a list of morality and thoughts. Vedas consist of mostly poems written about various ideas from Aryans destroying Dasyus to poets growing up poor.   Sanatan Dharma is an idea that many people like to preach about to make Hinduism look similar to Abrahamic religions. Fact is, Hindus didn't consider themselves a religiously organized people and references to Sanatan Dharma simply meant the Old Order. Given that Hinduism didn't grow out of a leader or cult, there is no separation of religious and social values in the old order. Today of course, it'll be impossible to lead lives like that given that our society has changed from the days of the Vedas."

The odd BM/BW depictions seem either lukewarm or riddled with clichés. Throw in the emasculation of Asian men, or making them into villains, with the exoticization/fetishization of Asian women, there are roots of rightful disappointment. I say Asian because both East & South Asians, to a degree, get similar treatment with regards to media portrayals a la fiction.  I don't believe in that race traitor nonsense, but for me, I'll admit I'm frustrated we don't see many films and shows featuring well-developed Desi romances.

It seems to be improving with actors and writers trying to break the mold and getting into more mainstream roles. Glenn from walking dead and Ajay Ghale from Far Cry 4 come to mind. However, they're still a fringe minority.  There seems to be a lot of disproportionate hatred towards Asian women for dating white men in male spaces. You only have to visit all the typical male spaces on reddit to see this.  They're constantly called race traitors, self loathing slurs, etc, which I think is uncalled for. My comment was just circlejerking around the idea. It probably fits better in r/abcdcirclejerk.  FWIW, I think I agree that attraction is not a biological imperative.

But I think the history of European & American Orientalism target & sexualize the Other (as woman) in ways that historically, brown men haven't been dealing with the same degree (we get other bullshit). Still, I definitely need to do more research on the matter and hit up some of those examples you highlighted. At the very least, I just never really saw (outside of Bollywood, which is paltry for numerous reasons) people like me on the big screen or small one, falling in love in complex & healthy manners, growing up, y'know? And representation is hella important.  But at the end of the day, fundamentally, I agree. I think we have to take charge of our own image-making and mythos, constructing healthy relations to our race, cultures, masculinity/femininity, and art. This means supporting and creating fiction that goes against the grain; narratives that dramatize our lives, and portray our humanity with full complexity."

I'm not talking about her thesis of assimilation (because I wholeheartedly agree), but her portions about our parents.  A lot of frustration is spoken of here in regards to parenting styles and the expectations they harbour on their children. My parents didn't give me much flexibility in deciding what that ""ultimate life plan"" should be, but I didn't really care. I wasn't predisposed mentally to make my parents proud and to give my future family the most comfortable living possible, I just went with it and barely rebelled against the notion. That opinion only grew stronger once I left home and realized how spartan my life was going to be for the next few years, with little in the way of money for luxuries (the money was there, but I felt more guilty than ever on the smallest of purchases), and no Mama to dole over you.  And so, here I am, studying computer science as a sophomore (a subject I had zero passion or experience for out of high-school) with the aim of maximizing whatever education I can get my hands on and cashing out in the end to ensure I don't ever have compromise on my kids. Because my own parents never compromised on me.  What are the rest of your's thoughts?

ABCDesis,3dsme1,IzmailPirzada,7,Sun Jul 19 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"I felt rather awkward reading that article as it completely did not apply to myself nor to the dozens to hundreds of desi families I have met in my country. Im a desi immigrant who arrived in this country when I was 5. Ive lived here most of my life. Ive had parents who were quite traditional and yet I never thought of myself as being abused. I appreciated that sort of parenting to be quite honest. Myself and my friends were that picture of the happy desi family in our cultural garb standing in front of the local temple/mosque etc that the author of said article derides.  The issue I have with this article is the use of 'we'. In this article it seems the author uses 'we' to mean all desi immigrants. I understand the author is talking about their own personal experiences and conflicts but she paints that as a systematic problem with the rearing methods of all desi families. I myself have never experienced those problems, nor have my friends; so reading this article is difficult as I dont relate to these feelings and sentiments of abuse at all.  What's frustrating about being a visible minority is when someone like the OP makes unqualified statements about 'immigrant homes' is that their views are automatically assumed to be representative of my views when its clearly not. I'm sick of the whole Asian dad/family stereotype and I hate the pity that it inspires in people. Yes I have an asian family but no, my success as a doctor is based on my own ambition and desire to focus on medical studies. No I do not regret anything in my childhood and I do not feel deprived at all. The only thing I remember feeling bad about in my childhood was the initial poverty that my family was in when we first immigrated. I guess thats my quick rant on my reaction to this piece. Im sad that the author has had such a rough upbringing and I hope she is in a better place now."

I too was blessed with parents who'd take a bullet for me, and who never raised a finger on me throughout childhood. I'm not Hindu but if I were I'd probably be bowing down to their feet at every opportunity.   But at the same time, I think we've got to realize folks like us are in the minority. The communities I grew up in were similar to me economically so I tended to extrapolate the lifestyles we lived to every single immigrant soul, when that really isn't true.   But are we large enough in number to warrant the author not using ""we""? I'm honestly not sure. All I understood was that she meant it as a rhetorical device. I've lived a relatively sheltered life and so haven't met any Desis whose lives growing up were rattled with abuse, but they're out there."
ABCDesis,3dsme1,IzmailPirzada,3,Sun Jul 19 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree that we are a minority. Maybe its confirmation bias or birds of a feather flocking together but I havent seen these emotional abuse issues within my community. I understand that it exists and Ive seen news reports/blog posts of terrible things like a girl who essentially got kidnapped for an arranged marriage but I dont feel thats the norm at all. Maybe someone with more interest/expertise in this topic will post some actual data on it. Until then Im unconvinced and I certainly object to the use of we. I dont want to be painted with a broad brush and victimised because of my background.  Edit: thinking about it even more; even if someone posted data Id still disagree with the use of we in this article. I used to work in Indigenous health. Indigenous populations have higher rates of child neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse than the average population. However, these rates were exceedingly correlated to SES. Indigenous peoples on the lower quartile of incomes are much more likely to be abused and/or abuse whilst Indigenous people that averaged the national average income were not any more likely to be abused than the standard population. However, if you ignore these nuances all you are left with is Indigenous people are primitive child rapists who need to be saved from their savagery. Its a narrative that is often played out in the media of my country and it has been used politically to control the lives of Indigenous people. Lack of nuance on Indigenous issues continues to facilitate the racism Indigenous people face in my country.   So even if it is true that Asian immigrants face more emotional abuse from parents I'd still appreciate if the author qualified that with nuanced statistics and analysis before calling for action against said problem."

I spent most of my childhood and young adulthood in poverty (we had issues with keeping up with bills etc but I was never hungry or anything). My two brothers (10 and 12 years my junior) grew up Id say middle to lower middle class. My parents dont have any major debts or anything but theyd always struggle with keeping up with rent or electricity etc. Now my brothers are approaching college and they qualify for all sorts of financial assistance. Most of my friends are like this. Some of them are more fortunate as their parents were doctors and were able to get back into that profession after passing various exams.
ABCDesis,3dsme1,bleedybutts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:02 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for answering; you fixed my predispositions.
ABCDesis,3dsme1,IzmailPirzada,0,Mon Jul 20 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"What stats are you referring to? You think people who come from this sort of upbringing are encouraged to discuss their abuses suffered by the hands of their parents and extended families? Number one rule of a desi household: never talk about what goes on in the house. Never talk about abuse. Never talk about your parents arguing. Never talk about sexual molestation. Never talk about anything that will make your family look less than perfect in the eyes of others. So I'm sorry, as much as I'd love to throw stats in your face, there just aren't any because we can never talk about these things or even admit that they take place. I WROTE THIS TO TRY AND CHANGE THAT!"
ABCDesis,3dsme1,bleedybutts,3,Sun Jul 19 18:41:32 2015 UTC,Number 1 rule in your household maybe. Thats my whole point. I feel bad for whatever things you have faced but you have no proof your household is the average desi household so as a desi who gets hit with the same broad brush I would appreciate it if you didnt claim it as such. Im not a victim and Id appreciate if you didnt make me into one.
ABCDesis,3dsme1,cyprusad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:06 2015 UTC,"I see what your quibble is with this article. You feel like you're being victimized when you consider yourself a self-reliant and level headed, individualistic person, fully in control of your life.   I want to suggest an alternate perspective for consideration. I think I can get across to you, because you seem to be amenable to nuanced arguments.   What this article is trying to do is start some sort of a conversation around un-acknowledged issues that a lot of people identify with, but haven't found the voice to address. It resonates in different degrees with quite a few people here and elsewhere, who know anything about South Asian immigrants, including of course, South Asian immigrants themselves.  Granted you're personally insulated from this particular experience, as you have made clear. That's fantastic. That said, I don't think this article is targeting you personally. As such, when the only objection you have against this piece is that the personal experiences you had and the ones of the people you know had were different from those written about, you are in a way hijacking the conversation from people who want to have that kind of discourse. You are also not adding anything to the conversation itself, besides trying to falsify the premise as a whole, in a way. If you peel back the immediate gut reaction you are having to this article, you'll notice that it is not victimizing Desi immigrants, but is in fact empowering them, to identify, as well overcome a lot of things that we don't think twice about, or have learnt not to handle, over time.  As far as looking good to white people, in terms of being devoid of stereotypes is concerned, I don't think that is priority numero uno for immigrants. Besides, there will always be people more than willing to stereotype communities on superficial characteristics. Playing to that kind of audience is wasted effort. As a headstrong, smart individual, I don't think dealing with ignorant people who stereotype immigrants is something your wit cannot handle. On the flip side, diluting and stymying a voice that addresses deep seated beliefs among people of our community is counter-productive in the long run.  That is not to say that disagreeing with the article is not an option. It is just that the grounds for disagreement, should, in my humble opinion, drive the conversation forward, in a way that everyone feels safe to acknowledge and talk about deeply held beliefs in a way that that is healthy and self-healing, for those that need it.  I hope I didn't vilify you or come across as bone-headed. I find it really cool when people coming from different places can communicate and come to mutual understanding.  Cheers! :)"
ABCDesis,3dsme1,Paragon23100,0,Mon Jul 20 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeahhhh....that's the problem with anecdotal evidence. Your experiences are your own, your perception of the world and community are shaped by your own notions and filters, some you (or anyone for that matter) is unable to realize effectively. That is why anecdotal evidence is not well regarded in statistics. Anyways I had hoped you would reply to my comment in the r/Pakistan thread, but I guess not."
ABCDesis,3dsme1,Paragon23100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:36 2015 UTC,"Can you please read the rest of the comments here and see how many people are saying that this resonates with them and that they have experienced these things? Here's another subreddit where almost everyone agrees that this is how they have lived as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/3du68q/the_secret_lives_of_immigrants/  Like I said in my article, we do not think of the greater good, and I'm super happy for you and your family, but many of us were not as fortunate and I stand by what I'm saying here because you are not my target audience. My target audience are the people who have spoken up to say that this is how they have felt their whole lives but have never been able to express it.   If you actually read my article, I also say that this is not true of every single immigrant, but that it happens very often behind closed doors and no one talks about it. I don't know why you're personally feeling so offended since this was never intended for people like you, and I make that perfectly clear in my article as well.  And you are making a huge assumption by thinking that I am speaking from anecdotal evidence that is solely based on my own life. No where in my article do I say that I have personally had to face these things. Just like you think everything in our community is hunky dory, I too have my own opinions and think there are systemic issues that we do not address."
ABCDesis,3dsme1,plantsarethebest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand--when did I say that I did not experience any of those things? However, it is very possible that I could experience those things, and still recognize the lack of value in anecdotal evidence. For all you know, my parents could be uneducated, poor, labor job working, refugees, and still not be (as a whole or interchangably) psychotic, oppressive, sexist bigots.  I saw your comment on Islamophobia, as well as some of your other comments, and pretty much understood the angle you had. I 100% understand that we have issues and that we must face them---but your near wholesale condemnation of the community, your inaccurate prediction for the future of Pakistani immigrants, as well as stereotypical assumptions about the community at large grounded in your experiences and world view (or, seemingly, not in your experiences, so more likely in your world view), that I do not see as reputable or accurate either, really highlights multiple fundamental flaws in your article."

ABCDesis,3dsme1,frackaracka,2,Sun Jul 19 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"I do not disagree that there is a problem out there somewhere. I disagree with me being included in this as a victim. If the article said tamil immigrants in NY or maybe pakistani immigrants in London then I'd have no problems with that as I know nothing about those groups. The article says 'desi immigrants'. Im a desi immigrant in Sydney. I havent had any of these problems. I literally know hundreds of people around my age group that live within very close proximity to me and we havent faced these problems. Most of us arent religious, have interracial relationships, study whatever we want at university and not many people care. That doesnt mean emotional, sexual, physical abuse doesnt exist but the low self esteem emotionally crippled people that this article suggests is the norm is very much not the norm here. This article identifies an issue but lacks any sort of nuance and depth to identify which specific groups they are referring to. All it does is reinforce negative stereotypes against all desis."

ABCDesis,3dsme1,IzmailPirzada,8,Mon Jul 20 02:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's cool that you are honest about the kind of awkwardness you feel when you read about these topics.   I think it really comes down to what you value in life. And it is usually different for everybody. So for instance, if you think that going with the flow and accepting the pre-defined conditions created for you by your parents is agreeable to you, and if you see life in terms of optimizing for financial comfort over time, you're going to find the idea of rebelling almost a touch absurd.  Our parents try to ensure our financial well-being and probably mean well and express themselves in the only way they know - but in doing so, they kind of skew our perception of the world just a little bit.  Life is not a zero-sum game and nobody really wins or loses. Genuine happiness usually has very little to with our economic standing. Life is best lived when you look forward to doing whatever it is that you do, every day. At times, we meet people who march to the beat of their own drums and don't see life as a destination where cashing out is the end-game and all your happiness is locked away in chasing that ambition. The kind of richness that such people bring to our lives can be quite something, but you have to open yourself up to experiencing it. If any of this appeals to you, then all of a sudden it becomes really difficult to reconcile what our parents expect of us, and what we actually want from our lives. Immigrant parents usually have no ways to cope with situations where the values of their children have diverged from what they are trying to instil in them.  We're all unique and we owe it to ourselves to discover who it is that we are, and sometimes we have to step out of the superficial boundaries that lock us in to do so. Perhaps that was sappy, so I will phrase it in a different way: given that we live in a land where we're free to do pretty much anything - wouldn't it be great if we could unlock our inner potential and boldly chase goals and optimize for experiences - and ultimately be happy everyday and make money in the process? :)  You seem like you have a great future ahead of you. I'll just leave you with this quote: “If the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else's.”  ― Joseph Campbell"
ABCDesis,3dsme1,circuitcityhobo,4,Sun Jul 19 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"It's actually great that you didn't have to experience things this way. Like I say, it's a form of emotional abuse and if you were spared it, that's actually pretty awesome. But not all desis have it that easy, and I wrote this to highlight their plight and what life is like for them. Those of us who came out of all this with our mental and emotional stability intact should try to help the ones who weren't so fortunate."
ABCDesis,3dsme1,ibby_be,6,Sun Jul 19 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I didn't realize you were the author herself!  And yeah, I agree. We all need to help each other out to blow off whatever steam might've been collected during our lives under our parent's roofs. We try to tell ourselves the past shouldn't dictate the future, but more often than not it does.  Hopefully, all this manifests itself in an era where we have a cultural shift and our future generations (or if you don't want kids, that's okay too!) can have stress-free and balanced teenage lives."

ABCDesis,3dsme1,WorkReddit3420,5,Sun Jul 19 03:04:10 2015 UTC,"For starters, this is a form of emotional abuse that we are taught is perfectly normal, and even necessary, to prevent our children from “becoming too Westernized”. Universal ideas of freedom and autonomy are great in theory, but honour and family pride end up taking precedence when time comes to take action. Tactics such as blackmailing, instilling fears of abandonment and isolation, and threatening to send the children back to the home country if they don’t comply with the parents’ wishes are often utilized to keep our youth in check. We raise emotionally crippled and dependent children, who don’t hold up very well as adults either. Plagued by fears of failure, of letting down one’s family, denying ourselves what we truly want in life, and suffering from overall low self-esteem, we are barred from even acknowledging that all this is common practice within our communities and cultures.

ABCDesis,3dsme1,newdawn15,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"I think one of the worst things about being Asian is our parents decide what you should do with your life with little regards as to changes in culture.   Let's take an example. I wanted to be in medical school. I had a hunger for medicine that you sometimes see. You know the sort who doesn't mind taking on extra ""surgeries"" to get his hand in. I am proud of my skills.   However? Medicine is a team game. I get along with everyone. Save one guy. Let's call him ""A"". Now A didn't want to be here. He was ""pushed"" into this field. Oh he's either not stupid or is capable of mugging the syllabus but A is basically no slouch in the education department. What he is however is frightfully blasé about the patients and people we work with. He's not interested in being here. He won't do any clinical work. He's more interested in doing the hours rather than the job.   Why? He probably had no interest in the job. His parents brought him up to be the worst of the ABCD/Non-Resident Indian malarkey. This half beast of bad thought.   He's racist. He's spoken out about my ""Nigerian"" (Actually Zimbabwean) friends. He spends money like water (that's none of my business really) but it galls him to help the people we actually see. His idea of a social time is just really macho skeeziness. Like? He's the exact stereotype of the worst traits associated with Indian men.   Think of it this way. I am not that attractive. I know that. I am likee 5 ft 11, 95 Kg and bald. It's a ""I do have to lose some weight"" so I am the last person to judge people by their attractiveness. He does. He's at least 20 Kg heavier, shorter and has demanded a dowry. I would never ask for one.   He's a product of an upbringing like the one mentioned here. A stereotype created to be as INDIAN as possible. So much so that even people here are more progressive and nicer than him because India itself seeks to distance itself from this ""Indian Man Stereotype"". Some poor lass is going to have to suffer through life due to him."

Or unless they openly come out and talk about how they're an Indian at heart and are solely in the West to make their money and get out (Bollywood's dream for ABCD's)  I wonder, how would they look at Jagmeet Singh? He's an extremely successful Canadian politician, but he's openly proud of being solely Canadian and has on multiple occasions called for investigations of India's human rights abuses. Many fellow Sikhs back in Punjab look at him as an exemplary Sikh/Punjabi, but to say he represents India the nation-state would be folly.

According to Reddit it should be okay to say you don't like a group, but come on... Hating on groups shouldn't be okay as soon as that group is defined by race. We are still relegating to color-blind thinking and ignoring realities (ie. ""I don't see color! We're all equal!"") if we say that coontown is just a hate sub.

The admins already banned /r/fatpeoplehate and announced their plans to ban the subreddit about raping women (albeit probably because Buzzfeed caught sight of that sub, kinda like when Anderson Cooper shined the light on /r/jailbait). In literally the sentence after, they said 'coontown' was good to stay.    I agree, there are so many more battles and hate groups to fight but I don't see why, especially in the US, anti-black racism is a wrong place to start.    Also, I see a ton in my news feed about what other minorities face. Let me know if you'd like in on some other new sources."
ABCDesis,3drgi7,sindibindi,0,Sun Jul 19 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"I am not mad - I just think your arguments for posting race specific posts makes no sense.   Anti-black racism is not a bad place to start - but if you are always talking only about anti-black racism, then it is like you are always 'starting' and never going forward from there cos it is only anti-black issues.   I identify with american-blacks as much as I identify with the chinese or the arabs."

Like you, most people here don't share my priorities, but unlike you, I think most people here get them. That's all okay.

ABCDesis,3drdur,iLoveSethMacfarlane,13,Sat Jul 18 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's crap culture. I'm an Indian, a Muslim, Male and when my parents left me and my siblings and went to India I was expected to take care of the rest of them (which I understand since I'm the oldest). My sister was in her late teens and there was no expectation for her to do any cooking but only to help me and the rest of us out, just like we always do. My friend on the other hand is from a similar background, but had a similar situation as yours where the sister was expected to take care of the rest, even though she was younger. His parents framed it as a religious thing, even though there is no basis for it in Islam.   The best I can advise is to talk to them about it - this isn't Pakistan and will cause problems for your siblings when they get married if they think everybody is like that. I know of a couple of divorces that have occurred because they thought of their wife as a maid vs a partner. Additionally it's pushing you away from your family and that isn't good any way you cut it. In my marriage my wife and I split the house work and also get our kids to chip in as they get older. Ain't nobody got time for crap culture. Everybody has to work together to get stuff done."

ABCDesis,3dpbdx,K_M_H_,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"No, clearly people give a shit. It's the nationalist politics that accompany and hinder the actual historical basis.  For the record, I am also very apprehensible of certain blacks who claim that this is part of a white genocide against blacks, or comparing the American state killing blacks to Hitler exterminating Jews. They are appeals made solely for emotional appeal and not factual basis.   To make it clear, I'm not disputing that A) this was Britain's fault or B) the loss of life was horrific. But I see that opportunities like these are seized by the right wing to overexaggerate the history to serve their own purposes."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,asdfioho,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"To make it clear, I completely agree with your statement later that ""The book argues that the colonial machinations of the British led to many lost lives, including Indian ones,"" I'm just very apprehensive on this subject because there seems to be a lot of pseudo-history going around (especially based on the last post in this sub on this topic, tons of un-cited blogs from people with political agendas), and the same credentials we'll put to task when questioning conservative readings of history don't pop up at this venue. For example, the history that many on /r/india would have you, that the British planned for a way to eliminate the pesky Indians from the very beginning just like Hitler and used this as an excuse to do so, is quite ridiculous. The argument that this was one example of drastic colonial effects on local economies (basically seen by how colonies' GDPs decreased every year and how the colonists' GDPs increased), and how the British's racial system that de-prioritized Indians in wartime ultimately culminated in the tragic loss of life, is much more balanced and one that I would be willing to agree to."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,asdfioho,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, we are in agreement then. The genocidal argument is not only ahistorical, but ignores the political economy of colonialism: it requires workers, who might be devalued and suppressed, but are necessary for the cogs to remain turning. Outright elimination defeats the purpose of that conquest."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,K_M_H_,-6,Sat Jul 18 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"So much misinformation, blind nationalism, and poor history goes on in those threads. Don't get me wrong, what happened in Bengal was terrible and Churchill was no doubt a racist, but these always seemed to be concerned more so with projecting Churchill as a reflection of Hitler than being historically accurate.   I'm heavily anti-colonialist, but I'm also very apprehensive of modern right wing nationalist movements that have sprouted in South Asia. One thing peculiar about almost all of them is that they twist legitimate anti-colonial sentiment to such a degree that they lose all historical credibility but manage to convince their devotees that all problems were because of the British. Very similar to the British tactic of painting pre-colonial India as under solely despotic, intolerant, and chaotic regimes in order to justify their presence as an ""enlightened colonizer.""

Whether they be Hindu or Muslim right-wing nationalists, I find them fascinating as they glorify their past empires and civilizations to mythic degrees (and certainly they had their splendour and achievements, but like any mass power, barbarity as well).

No, prior to the British, Hindu society was not all an orgy-loving free love hippie society. In fact, your suggestion that such a society is objectively better than, say, a somewhat conservative one, is also offensive to many legitimate Hindu thinkers. Of course Hindutva is a colonial product pretty much, which is why they spend most of their intellectual energy asserting their opposition to Christianity and Islam (which you too are doing in your own way) instead of referring to Hindu scripture.   -The Sikh scriptures are also ""prudish"" and ""conservative"" in that they advocate family life and are not overtly sexual in nature. So are the writings of Bhaktic cults  -Please see what some ancient Hindus had to say about Buddha   -I'm sure the caste system is another thing of your old culture you love  Your mindset is awfully naive, as seen in how you keep trying to push your agenda with these vague assertions and trying to victimize yourself instead of actual historical evidence."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,asdfioho,3,Mon Jul 20 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"You are possibly among the few non-historians or non-activists who actually understands this distinction. Hinduism as a religion could have been (and based on all evidence, definitely was) conservative prior to British involvement in the subcontinent and yet, Hindutva is a colonial product. Most lay people seem to believe that either Hinduism was always what Hindutva ideology portrays it to be or that Hinduism's conservative and fucked up ideas  and Hindutva were all the handiwork of the British.   To be fair, there is a lot of nuance required in this discussion because the British administration in India did explicitly favour the more orthodox groups of Hindus because of their inherent bias and political expediency but nevertheless, the disconnect between destructive ideologies like Hindutva and fucked-up Hindu traditions needs to be better understood."

To make it clear, I agree 100%, but I don't necessarily mean to ""bash"" Hinduism in any sense. There have been organic reform movements, like Bhakti (although I wonder if some Hindutva groups would label it as Islamicized) that people can learn from and there are genuine ways of going about deciphering out the genuine history of Hinduism outside of colonial projection of it, which admittedly damaged it a lot.  I think there's often this need for people to associate with the full-out liberal modern Western society and they make the same historical mistakes that people made when trying to associate with the prudish Victorian values."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,asdfioho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Means a lot to me.  Yeah, I never got the impression that you meant to 'bash' Hinduism. To me, Hindutva movement is mostly about a few idiots' insecurity that their religion doesn't match up to the religious values of their 'masters'. Do you know Morarji Desai, one-time PM of India and a believer in Hindutva ideology, once said that he wanted to cover up all the naked goddesses on the walls of old Hindu temples? Like seriously, how ashamed do you have to be of your own religion to say something like that about great pieces of art?   You are right that the modern ""Hinduism was super-liberal"" ho-hum is also a manifestation of that shame in acknowledging that complexity in one's own religion."
ABCDesis,3dpbdx,asdfioho,0,Mon Jul 20 13:38:04 2015 UTC,"is objectively better than, say, a somewhat conservative one, is also offensive to many legitimate Hindu thinkers.   I am claiming that it existed to an extent, so no need to be against it (to Hindutva organizations)  Not saying that it was an orgy-loving love hippie society nor a utopia in all respects. But it was better than people being like, ""COVER UP!"" They are indirectly supporting Islamic and Christian ideals just in a different brand, disguised as Hinduism!   (which you too are doing in your own way)   I don't mind what Muslims and Christians are up to, personally.   I'm sure the caste system is another thing of your old culture you love   It sure is. But it wasn't birth based, but rather profession based. You could have different people of different castes under the same roof! Historians believe that this corruption of the system was imminent during the Gupta Empire.   The Sikh scriptures are also ""prudish"" and ""conservative"" in that they advocate family life and are not overtly sexual in nature.   Not denying that. But again, I respect that. They are not like Bhakts who force stuff on others though.   Your mindset is awfully naive, as seen in how you keep trying to push your agenda with these vague assertions and trying to victimize yourself instead of actual historical evidence.

Kissing was there in actual historical evidence (I posted a link about that) as well as sex ed (kama sutra); they weren't all over making it taboo. Homosexuality too was tolerated.

ABCDesis,3dpbdx,jeffsaturday,0,Mon Jul 20 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"But it was better than people being like, ""COVER UP!""   If that's how you reduce modern Hindu practices, it's really too bad. BTW, where do you think the concept of forcing Hindu widows to wear white came from? The Brits only wear white for their weddings.   I don't mind what Muslims and Christians are up to, personally   Ah, but your comments insinuate otherwise. Take a Hindu doing something unfavorable to modern Western liberal values--> assert that they solely do it because of Christian/Islamic influence--> suggest that ""pure"" Hinduism wouldn't be morally apprehensible for this but it's the Christian/Islamic corruption.    Historians believe that this corruption of the system was imminent during the Gupta Empire.   Hm...so was the Manusmriti written during the Gupta Empire? Lot of fun stuff about caste in there.   Not denying that. But again, I respect that. They are not like Bhakts who force stuff on others though.   So you too take objection to the Bhaktis? Yet the Bhaktis were also extremely anti-caste and fought against regressive social practices done by many Hindus of the time...again, becomes hard to hold onto a narrative when the one rule of history is nuance, nuance, nuance.   Kissing was there in actual historical evidence (I posted a link about that) as well as sex ed (kama sutra); they weren't all over making it taboo. Homosexuality too was tolerated.    Check out what all the Smritis' laws are on homosexuality. Admittedly, there's not as much of an outright disgust of it as you may find in Victorian or Islamic discourses (even those are complex), but it's not this LGBT rights utopia as you may think.  Yes, the Kama Sutra is very sexual in nature. That you assume it is somehow the primary Hindu text to be revered is part of your narrative. You may downplay the Manusmritis' role because of its conservatism, but some uncle who is adamant on caste discrimination and not so keen on his kids sleeping around would similarly downplay the Kama Sutra and emphasize the Manusmritis.  Don't get me wrong, I'm being hyper-critical on purpose: to try to get you to think outside. I think Hinduism is unique in that there's a much broader religious narrative in general and more sources to pick from (as opposed to other ""religions of the book"" where there's one ""holy text"" or ""holy teacher), but I think one can practice Hinduism in the contemporary, live complementary to modern values, and simultaneously be intellectually honest about the history of their faith. I'm just not a fan of you're pushing a narrative.   Women were topless and people bathed naked in open areas (men and women, sometimes together).   Not all women were topless. In fact, this is something that had almost nothing to do with Hinduism and depended on your region.  Also, I'm not sure why I should necessarily be proud of all that? Obviously I'm not a fan of the ""COVER UP"" crowd like you mentioned, but although I respect their right to their religious practices, I'm not really a fun of hanging around naga sadhus proudly showing off that naked body that hasn't been bathed in a while for their ascetic beliefs. I'm sure many Hindu women are sick and tired of kulcha warriors enforcing dress codes, but I'm not so sure how that means they're all enthusiastic to strip down completely for the purpose of enforcing a ""liberal"" Hinduism."

Yet the Bhaktis were also extremely anti-caste and fought against regressive social practices done by many Hindus of the time...again, becomes hard to hold onto a narrative when the one rule of history is nuance, nuance, nuance.   They were. But they were progressive too for other issues unlike the idiots that run these Hindutva organizations today! They were also all inclusive to other religions just for the sake of community especially in the increasing rise of Indian patriotism. That was when the statement, ""Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava"" came into play. You don't see that in the Hindutva groups today. They are filled with hate, and bigotry.   but it's not this LGBT rights utopia as you may think.   Again, never said it was utopia. But people who are blindly cheat thumping bigots should reexamine their stance as it wasn't a CRIME as such. I don't know why people want it to be criminal though. And it is shunned upon in the Manu Smirti only mildly really. And some are opposed to the Smirtis since they oppose the Vedas in many ways.  And even though the Kama Sutra doesn't overly tell people to have sex, at least it educated people. Then why are some Hindus today against sex education? Doesn't make sense!   Don't get me wrong, I'm being hyper-critical on purpose: to try to get you to think outside. I think Hinduism is unique in that there's a much broader religious narrative in general and more sources to pick from (as opposed to other ""religions of the book"" where there's one ""holy text"" or ""holy teacher), but I think one can practice Hinduism in the contemporary, live complementary to modern values, and simultaneously be intellectually honest about the history of their faith. I'm just not a fan of you're pushing a narrative.   Absolutely. BUT, in addition to that, even Hindutva groups are wrong in the fact that they are forcing things upon people. And I am honest about my faith too. Everyone knows how there are some things in Hinduism that are prude. But the problem arises when people handpick these things and ignore the good things. I never claimed that Hinduism is some sort of utopia. Absolutely not!   Not all women were topless. In fact, this is something that had almost nothing to do with Hinduism and depended on your region.   Mostly in South India. And there is nothing of pride nor shame. I could care less. But it showed that stuff like that was seen as normal and neutral.   I'm sure many Hindu women are sick and tired of kulcha warriors enforcing dress codes, but I'm not so sure how that means they're all enthusiastic to strip down completely for the purpose of enforcing a ""liberal"" Hinduism.   I just want kulcha warriors to see nudity as something normal and not sexualize it as history has shown that it has not overly done that!"

Read Bhagat Singh Thind's case for why he deserved US citizenship. Or what Gandhi had to say about ""negroes."" White European racism was systematic and incorporated all peoples. Which is why many of us still have those mindsets today.   The police are straight up shooting everyone. It doesn't matter what your race is.    Sure, but it's very hard to deny that it's particularly among black Americans more than any other racial group.  Think of it like this; blacks didn't owe you anything either when they fought for the CRA that benefitted people of all colors. Heck, many black people today are very racist towards Desis or other minorities. That doesn't undermine that as minorities we should understand that just like we resent other groups having systematic privilege over us, we should think the same for groups that the system puts beneath us.  BTW-a lot of whites didn't participate in slavery either. The Irish also had it pretty bad."

No.   So, please point out to me, how we as a community, specifically, are part of the systematic oppression of African Americans?  We aren't. Do you know who is?  White people, the various local governments, the various States, and the Federal government.   So, to be clear:  I absolutely think that we need to, as responsible democratic citizens, support equal rights, support black people in their continuing struggle for equal rights, support the LGBT-Q community, etc.   But, is there some privity between a black man and myself because I'm brown?  No.   Do Indians have the same collective guilt for slavery and Jim Crowe specifically in regards to black people that white Americans should have?  No.   The only thing I really take issue with is this notion of ""racial allies"" and rampart guilt this sub wants to impart for the crime of being brown."

ABCDesis,3dn02x,INDY_Punjabi,4,Sat Jul 18 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, sheeet. Well, we are a model minority.

We have very low levels of crime in an amongst our communities as well (no specific stats), low divorce ratss, most Indian Americans come from dual parent households.       While Indians and other Desis have done well for ourselves in the American-Indian diaspora, the picture isn't so uniformly rosy. This article discusses both the good and the bad, as well as limits to the statistics that hamper a full image of what's going on. For example, we have a very large amount of undocumented migrants. Things are good for us, but they're not utopian, and I'd be interested in seeing data to supplement your claims.  But you're not wholly correct on the ""white people benevolentlt [sic] gave us that title"" bit, as there were historical currents that shaped this view. The immigration policies of the '60s targeted specialized workers, the cream of the crop, family reunification and etc. didn't formulate until the 1980s (the entry of working-class South Asians). Cold War politics, the Civil Rights movement, and pressure from other anti-racist movements/groups had much to do with America being seen as ""progressive"". The notion that there was no myth-making involved in the status of South/East Asians is also false, and there are a good deal of examples that demonstrate thus, such as the infamous Moynihan Report (which within its very text attacked Blacks and asked them to emulate Asians). Again, the book I'm referring to discusses thus. You can find an interview of its author here.   W...T...F. This isn't about black people. Did I miss the memo? Do I owe black people something because I am brown? Where can I make payment? <Many times, Desis themselves are complicit in this image-making (Dinesh D'souza being an infamous example, Jindal uses similar rhetoric). You named one guy. One guy who fits in the same spectrum of Jindal and Haley. Newsflash: we hate all 3 of them.   I didn't say you did nor am I asking you to feel guilty. But it is a patent lie that much of anti-Black sentiments are articulated in the 'positive' stereotyping of Desis. I can't speak for you, but when someone is racist to another and tries to use me & my people in their bigoted mythology, I feel a duty to tell them to fuck off. Those three individuals also don't occur in a vacuum, and their social capital & popularity amongst certain populations speaks volumes on America's race-relations. This sub, populated largely by progressive young Desis, is more an outlier than a substantive norm, but that's just my take. Here's an article that discusses D'souza in the context of his immigrant past.   We aren't antagonistic to black people. WHITE PEOPLE ARE. I didn't bomb black wall street, enslave blacks, throw them in jail....IT'S NOT INDIAN PEOPLE....ITS WHITE PEOPLE. Jesus, do you think black people sit around and cry over the store the Mike Brown gang looted? Do you think they care about Uganda? NO. Becauze black people, as a people, didnt habe shit to do with it.   A couple of closing remarks:  1) Yes, white people are the primary beneficiaries, enablers, and participants of racism in America. This does not in any way, however, exclude Desis from being participants in anti-Black bigotry. I am not even implying all, or most of us do, but to pretend that we're incapable of doing so is disingenuous. African-Americans & Desis have a proud history of supporting each other (Prashad wrote a book about this, here are some other sources: A, B). Shout out to /u/anirvan who has done quite a bit of work on this subject (I'd be interested in hearing his take on this discussion). But it's not all solidarity and peaches. According to one study, South-Asian Americans are the 3rd most racist group against Black Americans. Which leads me to my next point...  2) I said ""ideals antagonistic to Blacks"". Not group, people, demographic, but ""ideals"". What this means is the imagery of the successful immigrant South Asian (1) is often contrasted with that of the impoverished/undereducated/lazy/take-your-pick-of-bigoted-stereotype/incapable African-American. And this racist rhetoric is parroted by both certain sectors of White & Brown people.  In closing, I encourage you to read The Karma Of Brown Folk as well as the sources I've linked here. I don't think we're going to convince each other so I'm dropping the discussion gracefully, but I hope I've left something for you to consider. Take care yaar, peace, one love, etc.    (1) Quick footnote, said imagery often (particularly in the media) is illustrated in ways that do disservice to us, particularly the Geekification of South Asians in media, or we're shown as entrepreneurial unassimilated recent immigrants, the emasculation of SA men, exotification of women, etc."
ABCDesis,3dn02x,sindibindi,5,Sat Jul 18 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was an alt.    Anyways, Mr. Thind and Mr. Gandhi were week over half a century ago. I don't endorse their views, I actuary condemn those specific views of theirs, but do you really think that their views, by extension apply to the greater Desi community in America, today (emphasis).   Similarly, many whites condemn racist views held by their ancestors. The state in which this incident happened, Illinois, outlawed slavery and was a union stronghold.   To be clear, I don't believe we should advocate for black rights because of white ""collective guilt."" In fact, I think the concept is bullshit. What guilt do the grandchildren of abolitionists hold? Where's the collective guilt for the Irish? Oh right, it's not relevant socially because the Irish have pretty much blended into the modern white establishment, regardless of what was thought of them before. Obviously the history is a stain and that can't be changed, but what I am talking about is racial structures that permeate today and create a hierarchy of sorts, that decisively puts blacks at the bottom. Brown people, just like in their colonial heyday, are a kind of midway.    White people, the various local governments, the various States, and the Federal government   And the various local governments, states, and federal government also comprise of Desis as US citizens.   So, to be clear: I absolutely think that we need to, as responsible democratic citizens, support equal rights, support black people in their continuing struggle for equal rights, support the LGBT-Q community, etc.   Agreed   But, is there some privity between a black man and myself because I'm brown? No.   Not really, but you'd expect some kind of mutual understanding because of racism under a very similar if not the same structure.   The only thing I really take issue with is this notion of ""racial allies"" and rampart guilt this sub wants to impart for the crime of being brown.   I'm iffy on ""racial allies"" as well via the way you worded it. But I think it's absolutely ridiculous that you have a persecution complex from this sub. What did you expect, glorifications about our gr8 Vedic past and how much money our average uncle makes (not like we don't have those discussions)?

White people, the various local governments, the various States, and the Federal government   And the various local governments, states, and federal government also comprise of Desis as US citizens.   No, not really. Indian American participation at all levels of government is low. Additionally, it hasn't been a part of our diasporas culture to go out of our way to mess with minorities.   We never said: makes blacks slaves; if you cant do that, segregate them; if you can't do that, then throw them in jail. White people did/do all of the above.   The white establishment actively, to this day, disenfranchises blacks. Beyond a question.    I'm iffy on ""racial allies"" as well via the way you worded it. But I think it's absolutely ridiculous that you have a persecution complex from this sub.

I really think you need to understand that one can be extremely proud of their culture and also acknowledge social responsibilities or supposed faults with it at the same time.   Hmm, I think you are misconstruing what I say. Or, your redux of my argument is flawed.   1) I would never seek to impose ""our gr8 vedic past"" on anyone. For instance, that would be insensitive for me to do to you. That goes for Muslims as well. I agree, we shouls be critical of all facets of our life. For instance, if people want to have honest discussions about: dowery, child marriage, cast issues, gender inequality, etc, I say great!  Let's do it!  What miffs me is this sub and Indian Americans on this sub specifically. It consistenly applies the actions of ome weird indian dude to the populatuon of indian dudes in this country. And then it expects us to apologize for the actions of that one dude. So, pretty bizarre.   Let me use an analogy. And, before you read it, pleae understand I don't believe the accusatory narrative I am about to cite:  White people say all Muslim people need to proactively condemn the actions of Muslims who (to the left is what I dont believe) who do chattanooga shootings, charlie hebdo, you get the idea. Muslims rightly say, there is no lrivity between us and them. And, it's not fair to generalize the group for the actuons of a few.   All I am saying is Indian Americans need to have the same mindset.   You may then ask yourself, why does /u/indy_punjabi post here. Well, for starters, not all of my posts fight the circle jerk. Some are just replies to cool things.   But, more importantly: 1) there are younger people here. I dont want them being inculcated with this defeatist mindset; 2) there are ""foreigners"" here and I dont want them to think yhis subs socio politcal views are an accurate depiction of the greater community's sentiments-they arent; 3)I have never ever seen this outlook in real life.

""plenty of outrage with the police-Desi gramps incident""   Outrage ? Being outraged does nothing for anyone.

This is a democracy and protests etc. are only worth talking about if they do bring about some change. If changes dont happen, that only indicates that the majority of the population does not care a damn.   So what do you want people to do? If they're protesting and not yielding results, you can't force change, other than through violence. If you're advocating that, I suppose that tables the discussion.

Going to an international supermarket in a big city. There's no bar scene throughout the country except for in international neighborhoods in Islamabad. I'm a social drinker so at the end it's not really worth it. If you know rich western kids you can get their bootlegger and go to their parties, but even the cool rich kids, from my experience, are uptight and don't really party.

I've been quite a few times so the poverty, infrastructure doesn't really bother me as much, as sad as it is to say. But once I get there, it takes me a few days to adjust. It's crowded, it's noisy, there's no privacy, the shower situation is a hassle..I get conscious when I speak Hindi or Gujarati, so I'm generally pretty quiet. I miss home.   One week in, I'm getting used to life in India. I'm enjoying seeing my family, seeing where my parents grew up, shopping, etc. We usually travel so that helps too. But then again the homesickness kicks in. I miss my bed, I miss decent water pressure, I miss not getting sick. But after a few days back at home, I start to miss India. It's a weird cycle. I know that I'll miss it and everything that makes me uncomfortable is only something I have to deal with the in the short term, but that still doesn't change how I feel. It's odd."
ABCDesis,3dj6te,sampak,9,Thu Jul 16 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"What really blows my mind about it is that India feels like a whole new country every time I go. I think the people who live there see the change come on slowly so the scale of it never really registers with them, but when you only show up once every 2 to 4 years it's staggering.   It's like, wait, this road doesn't have potholes in it anymore? Your electricity is running all day and I haven't inexplicably smelled poop all day! Even the garbage digging semi-feral pigs are looking healthier!   And then you keep driving into some of the deeper villages and it's like you took a time machine to 1820 only everyone has mobile phones. It trips me the hell out."

ABCDesis,3dj6te,book-of-kells,6,Fri Jul 17 07:17:15 2015 UTC,"It's complicated. Right now I would say I strongly dislike it. All the visits so far have been to see family, and they are always highly stressful.  The visits aren't too long (usually around 3 weeks) and it's just a rush of trying to visit as many people as possible.  It's hard to keep track of everyone's names and you get treated like a child everywhere you go. There's nothing to do during downtime; the house where we usually stay belongs to my grandparents but no one lives there full time.  So there are always maintenance issues - like the lack of running hot water.  And for some reason my mom absolutely refuses to let us boil our own hot water for showering.  Speaking of the bathrooms, the floor is always wet. You want to have dry feet? Forget it.  There's also no TV and we're not allowed to go anywhere by ourselves. In my specific case, all my cousins are younger than me so there's no one to really hang out with.    The few things I did like: food is REALLY good and probably the thing I enjoy the most there.  We barely ever ate out so I avoided really bad food poisoning. Museums and stuff are really cheap and actually pretty cool, though very badly maintained.  The country itself is really beautiful but there wasn't too much opportunity for me to see much of it.  I haven't been back for about 5 years now and I honestly have no desire to go. I like my cousins but we have very little in common due to the age gap and the fact that I didn't grow up there. If I go back, it would be to go sightseeing, but there are so many other places that I haven't seen that I would rather go somewhere else."

I just finished chemotherapy for Hodgkin's Lymphoma last September.   I am fascinated by regional Indian cultures, and I truly like the people.. like I said though, no reason for me to go back.

I went to these fancy buffet lunches and dinner with a large spread for about $10-15.  Shopping is cheap and the quality of clothes are pretty good.

ABCDesis,3dj6te,By2Kaapi,17,Fri Jul 17 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely hate it.  Last time I went to Pakistan was in 2010. It had been quite a few years since I'd been there and it never occurred to me that me being an adult now meant that I'd have to act like a 'proper Pakistani woman'. For some reason I thought it would be a great idea to go there alone too, which was a horrible decision.  We all know about the food poisoning, load shedding, mosquitoes, flies, lizards, etc. so I won't get into that. What I want to talk about is my experience in Pakistan as a woman. My family is from a well known city, but it's not the most liberal one. Visiting Karachi/Islamabad etc. probably wouldn't be as horrible, but I wouldn't know about that because I never got to go there, or anywhere else for that matter. My family may also be crazier than most.  Anyways, The first day was mostly uneventful. Everyone were happy to see me and I slept through most of the day.  The next day, we were visiting my aunts and I was handed a shalwar kameez and asked to cover my hair with the dupatta. No big deal, I expected this. When we left the house I was asked to lower my gaze and mostly look down (WTF?). Why is this important? I'll get into that.  The next few days were absolutely horrible. My cousins went to school before I woke up and they came home shortly before dinner, so most of the days were spent getting roasted in the heat in front of the TV (and listening to my uncle's wife nagging). My aunt, who I was close with, lives literally 2 minutes away but I wasn't allowed to go there alone, I had to ask a male relative to walk me there, except they were all at school/work so I was stuck. One day, I got fed up and decided to just go there on my own. Those were the most uncomfortable 2 minutes of my life. Everyone outside were starring at me as if I had walked out there wearing a bikini.   One day my cousins and I decided to go out to eat, and on the way there we saw a couple on a motorbike. The woman did not have her head covered and the kameez she was wearing had a big round neck, making her back slightly visible gasp. Within minutes, there were two motorbikes right behind the couple, whistling and yelling shit at the woman.  When we got home, my cousin decided to tell his mom about it and we all got into a heated debate. Basically, every single person in the room, except me, thought that it was the woman's fault that she was getting harassed, because ""she could have just covered herself up"".   A few days later, we were coming home from somewhere on one of those rickshaw's that are open in the back. My female cousin and I decided to sit in the back (it was entirely her decision, by the way) and a few minutes later a guy on a motorbike was right behind us, winking and smiling at us. He continued to do this a few times and my cousin actually blamed me for it, BECAUSE I WASN'T LOOKING DOWN! Just imagine the trouble I got into when we got home. I was accused of encouraging the guy to keep winking at us (by not looking down) and even smiling back at him, which never happened.          The Pakistani cricket team came to a stadium close to where we live to train and I begged my uncle to take me there. Uncle didn't say much, but his wife kept telling me ""yahan ka mahaul aisa nahi hai"", ""women don't go to cricket games"", which is hilarious because if you actually watch a game of cricket, there's quite a few women there and the camera is constantly on them. (My dad said he would have taken me there if he had been there, so this may just be a case of my extended family being crazy).   I could go on forever, but this post is getting quite long. I understand that my family didn't mean any harm and were actually trying to protect me, but I'll never be able to get used to life in Pakistan. I haven't gone back since and I don't plan to go there in the near future."
ABCDesis,3dj6te,PurpleHaze7,4,Thu Jul 16 22:15:45 2015 UTC,I went in 2010 too and my entire fam including my sister went out and did the things you wanted to do. We live in KHI so it's definitely different. I visited villages and they are completely backwards.
ABCDesis,3dj6te,WeArePrettyAlright,9,Thu Jul 16 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"My experience in India is kind of like that too, just to a lesser extent. It kind of frustrates me. What's funny is that I usually get the opposite of the ""looking down"" thing. I usually look down when I walk, and my mom always tells me to look up, because it makes me look like I'm noticeably foreign, uncomfortable, and don't know my way around town.   The thing that actually annoys me the most is the period thing. My assumption was, pretty much anyone who has ever had a period has a trashcan in their bathroom. But in the motherland, not only is there not a trash can in the bathroom, you have to go to extreme lengths to even hide that you have a period. You take your sanitary items into the bathroom wrapped up in a newspaper, then, you come out of the bathroom with your bloody, disgusting whatever, wrap it up in the newspaper, and throw it in the hall trashcan where people may or may not already be sitting. Oh, and the icing on the cake is that you can't pray on your period, because you're dirty. I mean, I guess that might be expected, but I just hate that so much.  But yeah, a lot of the other stuff was the same for me as well. I basically got that once I started puberty, even though I wasn't really mentally mature enough to understand why I had all these restrictions all of a sudden.  Edit: Changed the first sentence, because I implied that all of India was like that, even though I can't actually speak for an entire country."
ABCDesis,3dj6te,selene623,3,Fri Jul 17 05:04:39 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I can't believe I forgot about the period thing! My experience was pretty much the same, except instead of newspapers you got a plastic bag. If you were lucky, the bag was darker in color but 9/10 times you got one of those clear, see-through ones. Of course, the trash-can was placed in the hall, too."

I love not being too much of an Other, like, brown people everywhere, sweet. Though I do stick out sometimes. Also, hearing the adhan calms me down, and religious landmarks are super interesting and also make me feel spiritually at ease. Plus the certain amount of lawlessness means you can get into fun, crazy shit. No one looks twice at you for wearing super comfy shalwars. The mountainous regions and certain villages are beyond gorgeous. You really do need to ground yourself and ignore the amenities and comforts of the West you might miss, though. It's what you make of it. Also, back-and-forths & banter in Urdu makes me burst with laughter infinitely moreso than English, something about the language lends itself to sardonicism and playfulness.

It was hot and dusty and smelly and the bathrooms didn't have toilet paper and there was no shower  and the mosquitoes always bit me instead of everybody around me and my cousins were in school 6 days a week and there was no internet and middle-of-the-day TV was all soap operas and I quickly ran out of books to read and half the time my mom's side of the family would just start speaking in Tamil instead of Telugu and I would just be lost and and we would visit all these distant relatives I didn't know and there would always be conflicts over me not being able to eat all the food and even though my Telugu accent was fine, I didn't know all the words and nobody understood any word I said in English until I repeated it 5 times.  Now? I appreciate it a lot more and enjoy it a lot more. I know it's partly because I've changed, I went to college and started actually caring about my language and culture. I grew up and decided conflicts over the small things were not worth my relationship with my parents and family (though now I just nod and agree and continue doing some things my way and people accept it because they've gotten used to me). My cousins still have work, but I'm old enough to hold interesting conversations with relatives of any age.  I'm much more comfortable speaking Telugu even at the beginning of a trip. I developed an Indian accent at some point for speaking in English with Indian people, and now they understand my English on the first try.  But it's not just me that's changed. The trips have changed, and India has changed. I go more often but for shorter periods of time (2-3 weeks roughly every 1.5-2 years instead of 4-6 weeks at a time every 4 years). We don't try to visit every relative on every trip, and instead take some time to go explore other parts of India, which helps with appreciating its beauty. There's internet. I have a Kindle. Everybody uses filtered water, so I'm not the odd one out drinking boiled or bottled water. Same goes for riding in a car or wearing jeans - it's so much more common so I don't feel like I stand out as foreign nearly as much. There's a lot more English words mixed in with everyday Telugu. There's fewer mosquitoes.   I certainly don't want India to become completely Westernized (and I don't think it ever actually will), but I've definitely taken advantage of that trend to become more comfortable with going to India and feeling like I fit in."

The first week I was getting used to everything. Second week I was counting the days to go back home lol. Once we started traveling, days went by faster and towards the end I was surprised it was already the end. I got a total of 4 colds the whole trip and of course 1 round of the diarrhea. My fam lives in Mumbai so I was there 85% of the time. The traffic was crazy. People LOVE to stare. I had to actually mean mug a guy back on the train because he had NO shame in staring at me. The mosquitoes had an absolute feast when I was there. Had 3 bites on my face the first night there. But overall food was AMAZING and so cheap even at the good restaurant. Kid you not I shopped everyday, it's never enough over there. Overall it was a good trip achieved all my goals over there lol After this trip I'm good for another 10 years lol"

I guess I prefer to stay in places that are medieval. In Pakistan, time slows down by a factor of a thousand, every need of yours is attended to, and I can spend as I want without worrying about bleeding money.  There's a warmth that accompanies being with family, all of whom speak the same language and eat the same food and all dress the same."

I mean, I don't think I would live there long-term, but it's a nice vacation. I get to see my extended family, eat good food, and I actually have free time to do whatever I want. Generally, in India, I'm able to eat whatever I want, and I end up losing weight, which I enjoy. Although, that's usually due to food poisoning, so that's not so great lol.  I also tend to stay indoors and hangout with my younger cousins, so I don't have to deal with all the dust and heat. I get dragged there every once in a while, because as a girl, I'm apparently supposed to love shopping. No one makes that mistake twice, though, as I'm not fun to shop with, and my body just can't tolerate all the heat and humidity.  By the time it gets to the end of our trip (usually week 3), I end up getting pretty weary of it, and I'm ready to go home. I get tired of the whole bathroom situation, having to  obey people solely based on their age, sexism as a whole, all the traffic, etc. There are lots of great things, but by the end of the trip, the bad things just kind of get to you."

I'm assuming that you're in your early 20s, and I know at that time you see some peers being financially independent but really you're still young and its not the worst to accept help from family to get to get your independent life started.   Lastly, it sounds like you don't want a 100% cut from your parents. Honestly, since they are desi they will view you as being their responsibility until you get married.

ABCDesis,3der37,ComeAtMeBrosephine,3,Wed Jul 15 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"If you are interested, you can start making your yogurt using 'desi yogurt' or even some of the other yogurts (with live culture) as your starters. You can also bring the culture with you from India. The only things you cannot import are vegetables/fruits.   I think we rely on big companies (and small companies) to provide such foods because of the convenience. It is the same reason we buy a lot of food, from wheat flour to sweets from stores.

ABCDesis,3de9ec,musila,3,Wed Jul 15 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"I understand your sentiment. I think that early immigration to Britain, with the awareness of their colonial power in South Asia made for a more assertive, rebellious-minded community. I mean it's hard not to feel that way to a certain degree when you're aware of the foreign presence in your home country. Not in a particularly negative way, but to embrace the difference and make their meshing of various cultural influences out and open seems to be something South Asians in the UK have come to stand by. There's quite a bit of research on assimilation laws in Europe and how they've had a significant push-back from immigrant communities. It's not surprising that xenophobia has also continued to rise as Europe continues to navigate questions of diversity.  In the U.S. the narrative has largely been ""we are a nation of immigrants"" so it seems that moving to some sort of 'model' isn't surprising. To show how people of many different backgrounds can come together in a certain way, reflecting a certain value system that meets liberal democratic ideals. Yet power is defiantly at work here because those ideals infused in to the 'model' minority is designed to look a certain way and seem non-threatening and cooperative. It reflects a very 'western' conception of how to live. In Britain, growing up South Asian...one could presume there is a long heritage of asserting one's identity in a way which American desis have yet to fashion. The chances that there will be any coherence in this formation of identity and assertion seems unlikely though.  I had some trouble articulating what I was trying to get at, but I hope that my initial thoughts make some sense."
ABCDesis,3de9ec,musila,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, the the whole ""people of many different backgrounds can come together in a certain way, reflecting a certain value system that meets liberal democratic ideals"" bit is touted often in liberal circles and is used to create the model minority idea but in reality it doesn't work like that.   In reality, the model minority ideal serves two functions. On one hand, it can be used to berate Black and Hispanic minorities (""Why can't you be more like these Asians?""). On the other hand it keeps the 'model minority' group complacent by letting them think that they're seen as equals by the dominant group. And so we have Bobby Jindal and Nimrata Haley.   The thing about model minorities is that they're tolerated because they're not seen as a threat to the existing status quo. The model minority groups, on the other hand, work twice as hard for half the reward. Just think of the fact that Asians are overrepresented in mid-level management positions but under-represented at the high level positions. That's because Asians (both East Asian and South Asian) are seen as people who don't rock the boat - and because they're too timid to rock the boat, they're seen as good worker bees but bad management material.  Don't think that desis have ""arrived"", just because there are a few Indian CEOs and we have a high educational attainment rate. To a lot of people in powerful positions in this country desis are still weird, dark, nerdy and beyond all else, foreign. Remember Joe Biden's Indian accent gaffe?"

ABCDesis,3dd9f8,CisternaChyli,6,Wed Jul 15 16:10:26 2015 UTC,Wow good job! Care to give us more details?
ABCDesis,3dd9f8,immilaw,9,Wed Jul 15 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can fill you guys in :).   Basically about 2-2.5 hours after takeoff from DXB, during the meal service, there was an announcement over the PA calling for a medical professional. I was still eating and had my food tray on my table, so I figured someone else would take the call. About 10-15 mins later, the call comes over the PA again. So I press my flight attendant assist button and nobody comes over. A girl seated a few rows ahead of me gets up and goes back behind me a few rows and starts attending to the situation. I couldn't see what was going on but I flagged down a Flight Attendant and told her that I'm a doctor as well, but the only ID that I have on me is my Diploma. I'm not practicing in India now cause I'm applying for Residency back home in the US. She also further told me that my assistance wasn't required at this time. Anyways, the other doctor girl comes back and I ask her what's going on. Turns out its a male patient with Cerebral Palsy (CP), who has a hx of chronic bronchial asthma, and he was in respiratory distress. I asked her if she had started oxygen at 4L/min and if the pt had gotten a rescue inhaler. She said she did both and she was gonna watch the pt. It turns out that the situation was much more serious. She goes back there a second time, I told her, look I have a stethoscope, can I help? She said yeah come with me. When I got there, the pt was really in distress and he had been affected by CP pretty severely (Scoliosis, contractures of limbs). This was a 20 y/o Male that looked like he was 10 years of age. It was pretty interesting, to say the least.   So I get to the patient, break out the steth, and let the first doctor (she's a dermatologist now but she's worked as an ER physician for a year) take a listen. You don't really need to listen to know that the pt is in distress, but at least the patient was getting air. Problem was that he was turning blue and it was getting worse. The most alarming thing was that his Oxygen Saturation was dropping, and fast :0. It was pretty low at one point, so low that most people shouldn't be living with that sort of O2 level. I listened after her and the lungs did not sound good at all. Thank god the air entry was bilaterally equal though.   The other issue was that even though he was getting oxygen, he wasn't getting any better. I later found out that a week earlier, he had a hx of aspiration pneumonia. His aspiration was making the asthma worse, and in turn, his breathing. Eventually, another doctor came down from Biz class and looked him over. She suggested we position him differently in the seat. It really didn't help. Eventually, a physiotherapist, who was travelling with the UAE National Special Olympics team, came over. We took the pt over to the bulkhead area, which has more room and laid him down. We got him positioned differently, started the oxygen up again, and the Physio massaged/gently hit the pt's chest so that his lungs would start moving again. Thankfully it worked, it took a couple of hours, but it worked. The pt ended up using 7 oxygen bottles in total and somehow made it to the States in one piece. It was the craziest situation I'd ever been involved in..."

This is a pretty big personal milestone because I had injured my lower back about 4 months ago. I had to take a a couple months off, do a lot of PT before I could start lifting heavy again.   I decided to make full use of this opportunity and started cutting. So the progress I've made while on a cut feels pretty good. I'm going to stick to these lifts for the next 5-6 months, focus on cutting and get to under 12% BF by the end of this year. Then try to maintain and/or slow bulk, try to get to the 1000 lb club (Squat + DL + bench adding up to a 1000 lb) and eventually compete (powerlifting) next summer."

ABCDesis,3dd9f8,analystdude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:10:43 2015 UTC,"How did you get started lifting?   I used to be pretty fit in high school - playing soccer, some boxing training, etc. But once I got to Engineering, I ate a lot of junk food, spent a lot of my time in labs, ended up drinking a lot and I got fat. Like really fat. At my heaviest, I was ~185 lbs at 5'7"" and had a legit pot belly. About 4 years ago, I decided to clean up my act and get fit. For the longest time I was just going to the gym and fucking around, doing bicep curls, tricep extensions, lat pull downs and a lot of cardio. I lost weight, but I wasn't looking good, that's when a friend recommended a strength training program called Stronglifts 5x5. I tried it, loved the progress I was making and stuck with it for 2 years (took a lot of breaks in between). Then moved to a more intermediate program called Madcow 5x5.   I've found that I can't squat below parallel, not even if without the bar. I have nearly zero flexibility in my ankle. I can't pop a squat at all. Makes me sad.   I've never had problems hitting parallel. I think having done a ton of body weight squats and playing soccer in my youth really helped.  However, Alan Thrall (one of my favorite fitness YouTubers) has tips on how to squat when you have mobility/flexibility issues. Here's the video. I highly recommend that you try it.  I wasn't stretching before workouts but my PT recommended that I do it. So look up squat stretch. Elliott Hulse of StrengthCamp has a good video on it.  I also do a lot of hamstring stretches, glute stretches and hip flexor stretches - having these muscles stretched and relaxed, help me hit parallel and not round my back.  Feel free to hit me up if you need more help, bro. Lifting heavy weights has done so much to my life.  I'm more positive, more confident, I look much better and exercise just feels good."

Maybe you should talk to your doc and get a referral to a PT and/or a trainer?  Whatever you do - remember this: no one became a marathoner or a world champion weightlifter overnight. Take baby steps. There's a this story of Milo of Croton that really resonates with me.   For basic strength, I've found Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5 to be the most commonly recommended programs. Start with just the bar, if that's difficult, start with your body weight and some 5-10lb dumbbells. Work your way up from there.  Good luck, man.

It's a very basic beginner strength program that has only 5 different lifts, done 3 times a week.  The basic premise is that you'll do squats, deadlifts, bench, row and overhead press. Just these 5 lifts will work your entire body over the course of a week and by adding 5 lb every subsequent workout you'll get stronger over time. If you're consistent in your diet and exercise, you will see results, brother.  I understand that you're feeling down. In my opinion, exercise is a very good way to start feeling better.

To answer the grown-up version of your question: I started looking and interviewing for new jobs while I was still employed. It was pretty tough, and in my case I made things harder for myself because I was trying to switch fields. In my case the better decision was to go back to school, but depending on your field it might not be so bad to just quit and figure out your next step."

ABCDesis,3d9vj1,K_M_H_,4,Tue Jul 14 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"Great insight, imo. I remember reading this a while ago, and I didn't have an answer for how we'd get some seriously interesting Indian American literature into print, or to the mainstream. And then I realized that it's already happened with Latino Americans -- ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"" never compromised its identity, and was so strong as a result.  The difference here between Latinos and Indian Americans here seems like market share: Latinos have been a huge market since Celia back in the 90s; they have Univision and commercials in Spanish and Dora, all directed towards their demographic. The reason that the publishers took a risk on ""Oscar,"" imo, is because they figured that Latinos would buy the story, whether or not the white people would.  What I'm saying is that if we show a little more purchasing power, buying stories that WE care about... I think we'll get the less ""white-washed"" books that are so prevalent now. That's my hope, anyways.  On another note: has anyone read any good ABCD fiction recently? The last thing I tried was 'Gifted', by Nikita Lalwani, and I couldn't get through it at all."

But you're definitely right, we need to support the art that speaks to us. I read an academic article once (I think it was 'Theorizing Complex Diasporas') that actually suggested, in the case of the UK at least, most of the commercially and critically successful South Asian literature was supported by a white audience, and there was a relationship of patronage at play in the production of said Desi art. So, it's key to represent ourselves and support such representations."

I moonlight as a writer, and recently have been pushing a short story out every week on my new wordpress blog. While I don't reduce myself to the mangoes and monsoon tropes, it's quite difficult not to refer to it.  In the end, it's not sinful to use these sensory elements in one's writing. Why, even Rushdie's Midnight's Children had passages on pickling mangoes by his beloved Padma (if that wasn't overt wooing of Padma Lakshmi, I must be reading it wrong).  Monsoons, the petrichor, the flavor burst of spicy buttermilk, the lilt of jasmine on a woman's hair, the cries of the street vendor, all these are endemic to urban India...which is where almost all the English writers tend to stem from.  To insist on a disconnect from these is quite difficult. In the end whatever sells amongst today's attention-deficit crowd is big. People will write a million versions of Fifty shades of grey if it's guaranteed to sell.  And if more people want to read Shantaram-esque stories, more will write about slums and saris, of congested railway stations and pickpockets, of roadside Romeos smoothening their coiffs with plastic bombs and girls in salwars clutching books and giggling behind bangled arms.  EDIT: If anyone cares to read, here they are"
ABCDesis,3d9vj1,TaazaPlaza,5,Tue Jul 14 21:36:58 2015 UTC,"I remember we've spoken on this occasionally.  I somehow disagree with what you say. The things you listed are found yes, but it's just an aspect of the surroundings. And what's more, in a modern world they form a very small part of life. Constant construction, MNC jobs, cars/bikes, movies and stuff are equally, if not way more a part of urban Indian life yet they are not exotic, so they're not what foreigners want to read about.  I mean, it depends on which class of society you write about but with most Indian English writers coming from very privileged backgrounds relatively, it's odd that there aren't more books about globalized, modern urban India.  IMO most Indian writers perpetuate these tropes themselves to force an 'Indianness' to their writing, and these things are instantly Indian - So it's an easy way to add non existent authenticity. If you observe the tropes you find in stories and the tropes you'll find in people's conversations/oral stories they're totally different - Because the written word still clings to the stale kitschy cliches while in real life people talk about stuff they actually think about.  I think that since there's not too much of a tradition of writing non exotic stuff, writers feel obligated to make their stories exotic and 'Indian' somehow while forgetting that anything set in India and involving Indian people is Indian writing by definition and doesn't need any show of authenticity."
ABCDesis,3d9vj1,SabashChandraBose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Look, if John sits down in front of his iPad and digs into his bowl of Quaker oats as he watches Fox TV, it's considered neutral fiction.  But if Satish sits down at his dining table, ignores the maid's sweeping and grumbles at the insistent traffic noise, but his face lights up when he finds that his mother had cut slices of mango and applied black salt on it, it's considered a trope?  What's the thrust here? I'd say character development and plot. If these exist, any story will be a great read. If it doesn't, you will find reasons to excoriate it, Indian or not. For example, the Twilight series and any written word of Chetan Bhagat."
ABCDesis,3d9vj1,akbar-great_chai-tea,4,Wed Jul 15 05:16:04 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a real example that'll help you understand TaazaPlaza's point.   When your scene is written for a Western audience, Satish will stop and think about the maid, how much she gets paid, whether her children get to eat full meals and whether he should pay her more.   In real life, maids are the default in India and nobody stops to think about them anymore than Americans stop to think about how much their cook gets paid every time they go out to eat. In fact, unless there's an NPR article on minimum wage or an outrage-factory-churned clickbaity listicle on 'social justice', most Americans don't think about restaurant workers's wages in their daily lives.   That's the difference! You can write about the exact themes and the way you write will make a difference in whether you are exoticising or merely portraying a slice of life from another culture."
ABCDesis,3d9vj1,TaazaPlaza,3,Thu Jul 16 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"I mean it depends how you do it. If it's mentioned in passing or if there's undue focus on 'doing Indian things'. Like many stories make their focus on how quaint 'simple Indian life' is and how the modern city life is so stressful and whatnot. It gets really grating to read after a while.  Maybe I'm just ranting a bit here but I'd like to see more descriptions of non stereotypical Indian lifestyles. I do not identify with most of these tropes you'll find and it's surreal that books from 'Indian' writers represent a culture totally different from yours with no room to accommodate you.  Narcopolis is a great example of an Indian book that has its own voice and I love Thayil's quote in the article :  ""I try to avoid any mention of mangoes, of spices and monsoons. The problem with those books about India […] I find it very difficult to recognize the country I know.""  And :   ""Those books” Thayil refers to are South Asian diaspora novels about the Indian subcontinent. Mangoes, spices, and monsoons. I’ll add saris, bangles, oppressive husbands/fathers, arranged marriages, grains of rice, jasmine, virgins, and a tacky, overproduced Bollywood dance of rejection and obsession with Western culture. The frustration Thayil expresses has been echoed by other South Asian writers and readers who don’t identify with the stories and struggles presented in many of the South Asian novels published in the West from 2000 forward — the era ushered forth by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Interpreter of Maladies and all the copycats that followed. They see nothing of the real India, or the real Pakistan, or the real Bangladesh, or the real diaspora communities reflected in these novels, which are designed for a primarily white reading public. What they do see are stereotypes — a colonialist “jewel in the crown” version of the subcontinent that includes tall servants named Raj and palm fronds, mosquito nets and teatime and exiles longing to return to their super romantic homeland. In much contemporary literature, South Asians are exotic little creatures fluttering about in glass jars for the bemusement of monocle-clutching Western observers."""

Rohinton Mistry does this quite well, though he applies it to urban and modern India.   Anyway, you answered it yourself.   I mean it depends how you do it.   Appreciating writing is subjective just like any art. What moves you won't move me. Chetan Bhagat will be a scourge AFAIK but I am wrong in the eyes of many millions.   So, just write how you know. Someone will read it."
ABCDesis,3d9vj1,TaazaPlaza,3,Wed Jul 15 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"I don't worry about people not reading more realistic stuff. On the contrary I think most people here would love to. We could argue on how that the 'exotic' style is pretty out of touch most of the time but I digress.  OK, I think we're missing the point here. It's not about us writing and people reading it. The article talks about how the general reading public outside India and publishers push for certain types of novels, the type that follow easy to digest tropes and are 'exotic' so as to be 'distinctly Indian'.  For example I remember an article posted here a few months ago about how publishers put these exotic, stereotypical images on book covers - Women in saris/burkas, silhouettes of temples, mosques, the Taj Mahal, etc to ensure they sell and mark them as 'Indian'.   Another example is in this article they talk about how a well written book offering some pretty striking insights into one of the biggest conflict zones in the world was passed over for years from publication. Why? Because it was different from the set in stone image publishers had of South Asia.  And also awards - For example the idea that White Tiger won the Man Booker because of how it depicted the same usual Indian tropes of poverty and stuff yet in a new, 'gritty' style. While other Indian books showing things beyond all that have not won.  Another thing you could argue is translation. As stated, most 'vernacular' books are pretty realist and deal with themes and ideas not 'exotic' or digestible enough for white audiences.  I like how she ends the piece - Why do we have to keep having to prove the 'Indian-ness' in our work? Why do we have to go out of our way to explain these Indian quirks or dilute them so that white audiences understand? If an Irish author can write a novel with Dublin slang that no one outside the island is going to understand, why is it anathema for Indian novels to have healthy doses of (actual contemporary) Indian English or Hindi/Bengali/Tamil/etc words without having to write lines and lines to explain their meaning?  There's something similar that went on with LatAm writing - Everyone expected LatAm writers to write in a flowery, image heavy magical realist style and publishers rejected writers who did not conform to such a style calling them 'not Latin American enough'. Google the McOndo movement, it's interesting.  (Also, for some reason you've been downvoted)"

In freshman World History I, we did a section on comparative religions and looked at Hinduism and Islam in South Asia and how they shaped South Asian politics through the years. We also studied the migration of Buddhism from South Asia to East Asia. We also touched upon religions with fewer adherents in South Asia, such as Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and Baha'i. We also learned about the Sepoy Rebellion and the contribution of the Indian Sepoys in WWI.   In World History II (sophomore year) we did a huuuuge unit on imperialism and its evils around the world and a large part of it was about how Britain basically ruined India under the guise of ""civilizing it.""

Part of the day included a costume competition. I had brought my favorite pink gaghra choli, but was too anxious/nervous about wearing it, so the prize went to this blonde girl whose father bought her a qi pao from some flea market.  In high school we touched on it in AP World History where my teacher informed us that for the purposes of getting a 5 (top score) on the exam, we had to say that Hinduism was a polytheistic religion. It offended me then because it set up the whole ""polytheism < monotheism"" structure that was upheld in that area, but looking back I don't see why polythesism has to be such a bad thing, unless you're an evangelist."

ABCDesis,3d7i22,iheartlucifer,3,Wed Jul 15 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"Man this is a topic worth its own PhD dissertation...I personally am an advocate of Punjabiyat, an ideal that arose in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's Empire of consolidated Punjabi identity outside of religion. The reality of how Punjabis currently view their ethnic identity is quite different, well, at least in the West. Punjabi Hindus overwhelmingly identify as ""Indian"" and plug into North Indian high caste social circles more and speak Hindi, Punjabi Muslims as ""Pakistani"" who speak Urdu and plug into those circles. Punjabi Sikhs are generally more into the whole ""Punjabi identity"" thing in the West, which is obvious when you see the religious identities of the majority of Bhangra singers. Obviously, when you see the culture as practiced by, say, rural Punjabis in Pakistan and rural Punjabis in India, it's extremely similar and there's a common cultural thread despite religious differences. Which is why I personally identify my ethnicity as ""Punjabi"" and religion as ""Sikh"": I'm also very much ideologically against how Punjabi and Sikh are conflated, as Sikhs can be of any religion. However, the practical reality is that Punjabi Sikhs, Punjabi Hindus, and Punjabi Muslims have their own unique cultural practices in the West formed by politics."
ABCDesis,3d7i22,asdfioho,2,Wed Jul 15 02:52:31 2015 UTC,I guess it is different in the West.The more recent arrivals from in the US from Punjab tend to be pretty close knit to include both Sikhs and Hindus.Pretty much the same IMO.Hindus going to Gurudwaras etc etc.Punjabi would def be a ethnicity as opposed to Sikhs being a ethnicity though some Sikhs would like to be labeled as a different ethnicity.There is a divide here i guess.Apparently when Sikhs have been attacked post 9-11 there wasnt much of a response from the larger Indian community as there would be to a Hindu getting assaulted so i understand why some in the Sikh community want to distance themselves a bit.

None of his relatives had married or were married to other Desis, most chose Chicano or white partners, so aside from occasionally enjoying the food (prepared by elderly aunts), he had no connection.

Choosing to remain naked could have made the Ezhavas ineligible for becoming true respectable Catholics.   Nairs were a matrilineal warrior caste who often had ostensibly more money and social capital than Namboodiri Brahmins. There were often clashes because of this imbalance in class and caste hierarchies. Nair women, who handled their own money and property, being ""forced"" to stay topless for the Namboodiri males is not a very historically plausible situation."

See http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/article100440.ece  Quotes from that article :   Ezhava women secured the right to cover their breasts in 1865. Nair women stopped exposing their breasts in front of Brahmins even later.   Apparently even Brahmin women couldn't wear upper clothing in certain situations :   “Namboodiri ladies could not wear upper body cloth while at home. Though they were allowed to cover their breasts while venturing out, they had to remove it in the temple, in front of the idol. In the case of Nair women, they could not cover their breasts in front of Brahmins,’’ Joy writes in his book."

There are historical accounts of labourers who had migrated to Sri Lanka to work in colonial tea plantations returning with enough money to lead European lifestyles. Converted Nadars, too, started wearing upper clothes and saw it as a sign of social progress.   I didn't deny the existence of toplessness but its association with body shame and indignity had some fucked up origins, much like India's anti-homosexuality law."

In tropical, warm climate countries, it's hard to imagine women (or men) wearing upper body clothing (in the past) unless it was a societal requirement. The ""shaming"" part probably was a more recent (relatively) phenomenon."
ABCDesis,3d80w6,cyprusad,3,Wed Jul 15 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Women in other parts of India which were similarly hot and humid wore similar clothing.   In Bengal, where my family comes from, rural women from my grandmother's generation considered covering their breasts in the same vein as covering their head. It was more of a parochial form of paying respect than anything else. They never covered up in front of their kids, servants and anyone who was not a patriarch. The whole idea of wearing a blouse with the saree was invented by Rabindranath Tagore's aunt, adopting European ideas in the late 19th century to make sarees more fashionable and not just a farmer's wife's daily garb. Persian-inspired stitched dresses most likely held that position prior to this."

In speaking, Hindi never adds -a to any of the male names you mention.  Boys with these names in the heartland almost never have the trailing -a.  My understanding was that the -a in Shiva is added in transliterating the name to English to signify a full v sound at the end, as opposed to a half v sound that you get with the English word shiv (knife). The feminine form of these names, for instance Draupadi's name Krishna, is usually transliterated as Krishnā."
ABCDesis,3d6hib,JeffMurdock_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"Hindi is closer to Punjabi, but this has been my consistent observation, dunno why. For example, names with the suffix -inder are very common in Punjab (Devinder, Ravinder, Satinder, Jatinder), but among both my Telugu and Hindi friends they add an -a and are pronounced as such. Hence why Jeetinder and Dharmindar became Dharmendra and Jeetendra in Bollywood. I admit it could just be that my friends are misinformed and mispronounce it, because your explanation is what I had heard before and makes more sense."
ABCDesis,3d6hib,asdfioho,3,Tue Jul 14 12:09:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, that.  This is because of subtleties in pronunciation, and hence transliteration to English.  While Hindi combines the soft d and the r at the end of -indra, Punjabi does not, which is why the suffix is transliterated as -inder from how it is spoken in Punjabi.  And this is only with the suffix -indra/-inder.  The god's name is still Indra, even in Punjabi.  This is separate from the other Gods, of course."

In the 'Theaetetus' Socrates likens himself to a midwife of intellectualism - though he is himself barren, he helps others deliver. Search for 'Plato' and 'women' and you'll find hundreds of articles and books written on this subject.

Psychedelic drugs open up your mind to so much self-discovery, if done with the right kind of people in the right setting. At 20, if you have so much of your life together - you really don't seem like an addictive personality. So really, you don't feel bad about any of this because there is nothing to feel bad about!  I totally understand how it feels to hide your true self from your parents. There is so much to our unique personalities that we are unable to express because of the narrow band of things that our parents expect us to be concerned with at all times.  What I ended up doing was seeing my parents very rarely, making ""legitimate"" school/work related excuses. I really wasn't in the mood to have my self-development and exploration stymied to match my parent's frequency and slow growth rate. I love them and all, but I needed to be my real self and be comfortable with it, sans judgement. I'd say, take your personal growth in your hands and don't expect everyone to be onboard with it. Just stay true to yourself and follow your heart - wherever it takes you! Be smart though; but from the sounds of it - you seem to be requisitely cautious. You're in college - smoking pot is not the biggest deal in the world.  About building back their trust, it's okay to have some incidents of such nature - desi parents usually deal poorly with rebellion of any kind - so this toxic communication on their part is to be expected along the way, as you grow and try different things that don't sit well with your parent's sensibilities. Put it behind you and act like it doesn't matter as long as you keep the rest of your life together, and over time your parents will forget about it. Don't worry about your reputation with them - it's a fluid thing, and you can never be too pristine or truly in the dirt with it - it changes over time and people have short memories. Go on and chase your next achievement/goal. This is really unimportant in the larger scheme of things.  Good luck with everything! :)"

My response might have come off as heavy-handed, straight up dismissal of your parents - I guess I was making a broader point.  If you make rational choices that sit well with you, deep down in your gut - then be prepared to take on the occasional fight to defend your choices, no matter how controversial they seem in your social circle. It is totally healthy emotionally and you will grow.

ABCDesis,3d4p49,feetintheair12,0,Wed Jul 15 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"There's some pretty solid advice in here. At the end of the day, it's their home and their rules. You don't have to like em, you don't have to (and shouldn't) feel guilty, but you do have to respect the rules. Keep that shit out of their home.  Not to go off on too great a tangent, but there seems to be a theme here (and elsewhere in this sub) of hiding a part of yourself in front of your parents. This has been a big part of my life for a long time, and I find it rewarding to slowly whittle that down to practically nothing. Someday, I won't have a chance to know my parents as people. When they die (or if I die), the conversation just kind of ends. Do I want it to end with them never knowing that I smoked weed? Or that I dropped acid? I mean, it's a part of who I am, right? And I want my parents to know who their son is. In fact, I almost owe them that.  It's tricky, to be sure. I'm not advocating for beating them relentlessly over the head with truth bombs. That'll shock them and stunt the conversation. But maybe -- if you're up for it -- you could use this incident as a launching point for a better understanding between you and your mom about your different attitudes about grass. The truth is that she probably doesn't care as much as she appears to; she was young once, too.  Anyway, I wouldn't sweat it too much. The world is changing, and pot is everywhere. Do look into a vaporizer, though. Or edibles. The particulate matter settling on your lungs is bad news. I wish I'd known about vapes when I was a stoner."

I think parents in our community have a tendency to encourage that in the kids though -- obviously, lying isn't always a good thing, but in my experience, parents are just as guilty of not wanting to know everything that their kids are up to. Plausible deniability is far easier to defend and makes confrontation less likely."

I'm a regular stoner but I don't really want my parents to know. If they do I don't talk about it. But I hide my weed. I don't smoke of they're coming over. I have stuff to mask the smell.   And yes if it's illegal be carefull! I never have enough ok me to get anything but a misdemeanor and I live in a weed friendly city. I don't smoke outside the city limits or in neighboring counties because they'll fuck you. Last thing someone your age needs is a drug charge fucking up your perfect GPA scholarship etc.   Also: weed is an expensive habit. It's actually probably cheaper for me to smoke tobacco or drink than smoke but... eyyyyy I'm the regular stoner telling you not to do drugs.
ABCDesis,3d58dl,Nylese,16,Mon Jul 13 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Not to deride from the article, but the anti-South Asian attitudes among Arabs is also really startling. From Kuwait to the UAE to Saudi, our condition there speaks volumes to what the Arabs think of their 'brothers & sisters in Islam'  I also think the theology and conceptualization of race among many generations of Arab/Desi Muslims widely differs from Black (esp. African-American) Muslims with regards to the model minority mythos, respectability politics, etc.   There are of course, and have been, activists in the former groups but critical race theory and militancy is much more prevalent in the latter. Given how much white supremacy disabuses us all, this is something to learn from. I find it very telling how Arab/Desi Muslim youth look up to Malcolm X for example, but seldom wish to actually emulate the great man.   The fixation upon venture capitalism, donations, and philanthropy coupled with ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" rhetoric among the more middle/upper class sectors of Arab & Desi Muslims also create a distance from traditions of reform, revolution, and dissent among Black Muslims, markedly different from the shame of causing a scene in the former communities.   I'm generalizing as there are exceptions to all this, but no matter your colour, the situation for Muslims in America is dire, and a practical, loving unity (not one that is artificial) amongst us needs to be cultivated. Not only for its own sake, but to tackle the issues that affect us all."
ABCDesis,3d58dl,K_M_H_,11,Mon Jul 13 17:47:19 2015 UTC,"This was an absolutely terrible article.  The article could have been so much better if the author had just stuck to very particular issues instead of trying to grab everything in the air and try to link it to racism.   For one, the death of the Somali teenager was fairly known in the Muslim community, the difference here was that the perpetrator was an ex-Muslim Somali himself. One of the things minority groups have to be honest about is that when its oppression by the majority white population, that motivates us to mobilize far more effectively than when the problem comes from within our own communities.  ISNA's response was trying to play it politically safe, but they were also responding to the large number of Muslim businesses that were attacked during the riots. Arab, East, and South Asian owned businesses were targeted by rioters and many of these business owners were Muslims. Though ISNA's statement was inaccurate, it was far from driven by any sort of racist undertones. Also, not sure why ISNA is being equated to Arab and Asian Muslims, when a large portion of ISNA's members are African-American and Americans of different ethnic and racial makeup.  I read the Princeton study that the author referred to and personally found several holes. For one, there is no active policy of segregating African-American Muslims from mosques. The problem lies in the cultural correlation of Islam in America and in the Muslim world. Islam is heavily influenced by our cultural background, just as many other religious groups are. Though the basic practices are the same, there are many traditions in the Muslim world that are specific regional practices. When immigrant groups move to the US, they bring with them these cultural practices that are so strongly ingrained in their own belief of Islam to the point that African-American Muslims and many convert Muslims find them to be strange and obviously not participating in these practices leads to their cultural isolation and religious isolation. This is apparent in large metropolitan areas where mosques largely cater to a specific cultural identity. You'll find Turkish mosques, Indo-Pakistani mosques, Arab mosques.  The culture of using skin whitening creams are now proof that we're racist against black people? It just means that we're racist among ourselves before we're racist against black people and lets be honest, this sort of ""racism"" also exists among most colored groups in America, including African-Americans.  The author makes a false equivalency between the Middle Eastern slave trade and modern-day racism. While its true that slave trade existed in the Middle East, and there was a large market of slave trade, it was driven by conflict, more so than race. Areas of conflict produced slaves, and that allowed the trading of slaves in much of the Middle East, its why there were so many Slavic slaves throughout the Middle East and actual white slaves (mostly of Eastern European descent) during this same time period.     Referring to black Muslims as abed, or “slave,” is commonplace among some Muslim communities, and many South Asian– and Arab-American families discourage if not outright forbid their children to marry them.   I wish the author had spent more time addressing these issues rather than the ones she chose. These are far more dire and pronounced than any of the examples she used."
ABCDesis,3d58dl,tinkthank,5,Mon Jul 13 20:21:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for writing this up.
ABCDesis,3d58dl,Shopno,5,Tue Jul 14 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"This is a very good breakdown. Regarding the Abed thing, I don't think I've ever heard anyone in the Muslim community call a black Muslim Abed, though I'm sure it does happen in more insular and homogenous communities.  For more diverse communities though, I don't think I've seen any racial segregation or superiority. My Pakistani friend's brother married a Somali woman and one of the board members of the mosque my parents go to married a Jamaican convert and he's Lebanese (side note: the food at their house is amazing).  I see the race problem more being driven my cultural bigotry and isolationism than the religion."
ABCDesis,3d58dl,GWmyc2,7,Mon Jul 13 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"I've heard the Abed thing from Arab teens, but that was back in my early high school years. People are ignorant, and sometimes get over it. I haven't heard too much of that outright racism in a long time and whenever I do hear it, it seems to always be directed towards non-Muslims not that its better, if anything its just as bad.   There's a lot of subtle racism though, and even though people are opening up to inter-racial marriages in the Muslim community, its still met with a lot of resistance.  The cool thing though is that a lot of Mosques offer matrimonial services and quite often, they don't even look at racial and ethnic background as a category, but while the institutions within the Muslim community are taking a more progressive stance, there's a lot of individual resistances and still an adherence to some very old school racism that needs to go."

ABCDesis,3d36ji,PurpleHaze7,5,Mon Jul 13 13:31:22 2015 UTC,"Lots of reasons. Pakistani people tend to be more conservative and that usually equals being more protective of their women. They usually dress quite conservatively.  Of all my Pakistani friends, just a handful married outside their ethnicity, and none of them married a non-Pakistani except for the one who married a white guy. NONE of the Memons married a non-Memon. I swear, Memons are their own tribe.   Compare that with Bangladeshis who tend to be more liberal, perhaps slightly more open minded, largely non-practicing when it comes to Islam but they retain a cultural affinity for Ramadan and holidays, and don't have nearly as many strings attached to their children.   Lastly, I feel like Pakistani women (and only women, not men) grow up in an environment where they never really expect to have the freedom to experiment with who they date or marry. Goes back to that protected environment. The end result is sort of an imbalance in Pakistani-American society with how liberal and free their men tend to be vs the women.  Lastly, they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder but Pakistani men objectively meet our society's standards of beauty. Can't ignore that.   So what's your assessment of my assessment?"
ABCDesis,3d36ji,TeslaModelE,3,Mon Jul 13 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"Pakistani women dress more conservatively than bangladeshi women? It's a genuine question by the way, there aren't many bengalis where I live :-)   I agree that Pakistanis are very protective of their women, but in my family, only the women have married non-Pakistanis (white guys and afghans mainly. Some distant relatives have married turks and blacks). Actually now that I think about it, there's one male relative who has married a dutch woman, but that's it.   Definitely not saying that this is the norm among Pakistanis though, my dad wasn't happy when I told him about a (desi) non-Pakistani guy I was dating. When my mom's sister married a white guy my grandparents were shunned in the pakistani community for years. It's more accepted now, though.    Compare that with Bangladeshis who tend to be more liberal, perhaps slightly more open minded, largely non-practicing when it comes to Islam but they retain a cultural affinity for Ramadan and holidays, and don't have nearly as many strings attached to their children.

We have the luxury to do that because we're not dependent on our parents financially, so there was no threat of being ""cut-off"" if we didn't listen to them and their wishes. Things did get pretty rocky for us for a few years, but our families finally came around when it was obvious to them that we were not going to break-up just to make them happy. They had to accept it or they couldn't be a part of our lives. They eventually accepted it.  Our families are not crazy religious. His parents are Hindu and do the regular stuff, nothing hard core.

There were Indian influences in her song (and that is fucking awesome, by the way) so in her video she had a bit of Indian flavor to it. I see nothing wrong with that.   I for one loved the fact that she did it. Hell, most Indians I know don't know shit about our culture, but I'm not gonna get mad at a girl for wearing a chandlo as a fashion statement. The same way I'm not gonna get mad at one of my white friends for wearing an Indian outfit simply because ""it looks cool.""  Of course you're allowed to be offended. I just think people take things way too seriously these days and really need to lighten up. If you want to be offended, be offended by shit like the Big Bang Theory's portrayal of Raj.  Normally, that doesn't bother me. I mean stereotypes are there for a reason and being someone that went to a school with a ton of Indian Engineers, his character has traits similar to what I saw in real life, but they take that to a whole different level.  The only stereotype Raj hasn't fulfilled is owning a hotel/gas station and driving a cab.   THAT is something to be offended about, not that Selena Gomez used Indian influences in her song, video, and dress. That's something we should be happy about and celebrating.

I wouldn't say his parents having money is breaking a stereotype, most Indians I know that came from India (myself included) weren't living in the slums.  But look at how his parents are dressed every time they show them, like they're always at a wedding or acting in a serial or something.  Look at how Raj is the weakest character of the group.  Look at how when he does get a girl...it's the weird awkward one.  He's the butt of more jokes than anyone else on the show.  I know all the characters on that show are weak, but that somehow, Raj trumps them all, and is also Indian, for a show that is catered to the CBS crowd (old white people)...I don't think it's a coincidence.  Normally this stuff doesn't bug me at all (like I'm not bothered by Apu at all), but this just gets to me for some reason.  Major props to Parks and Rec for having Aziz be more representative of what an Indian guy in his mid to late 20's is actually like, in America.  We aren't all weird.

The economic landscape has changed a lot since 2008 and life can be very hard for those who major in ""soft"" majors.  I see my own friends struggling a lot with massive student loans and shitty jobs/benefits.  If you are Canadian, I am assuming there is less risk involved since Canada has free or cheap college and universal health care.  This is what I usually suggest:  Can you double major in fashion and a more stable career field?  My friend is a software engineer turned baker and she is super happy with her life.  She in fact worked as an engineer for 3 years and saved up a lot of cash to start her own bakery.  This will require serious academic effort though.  I honestly recommend that all Desi kids try to become financially independent as soon as possible.  That way your parents are not calling the shots in your life.  Especially as a woman, you don't want to be pushed into a marriage because you don't happen to be independent.

My parents weren't happy with my choices, but in a sense, they equate financial stability with happiness.    You also have to remember that you have a life to live independent of your parents. And if you aren't happy studying biology for 40 hours of a week (before you take into account studying medicine), then you really can't say you want to do that. I made a compromise with my parents, which I why ended up where I am. I'm not happy, but a lot happier than I would have been.    So this is my advice to you--go into wearable technology.

ABCDesis,3cvvu7,confusedpresomething,3,Sun Jul 12 06:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at a point in my life where I have to choose a career for myself and have had many many fights and arguments with my parents about what I should study. From what I've experienced, I think our parents' career mindset is still stuck in the homeland.   I know this is extremely obvious but I was kind of shocked when I realized this and all their nagging suddenly made sense.   In the homeland, the only way to make it was to major in either engineering or medicine because those were the fields that provided stability and income. They brought that mindset with them here and haven't changed it. Hence all the nagging and shaming.   I actually fell for my parents' pressure my first year in college (speaking as a post-second year undergraduate student) and decided to major in engineering. I realized that engineering wasn't something I could see myself doing for the next 20 years so I switched majors to pre-medicine on my own (parents didn't want me to become a doctor - I know this is strange).   But then I realized the sacrifice that being a doctor would entail after many more fights with my parents so I decided to do something else entirely.  What I got out of all this fighting was a more realistic view of life and a better understanding of what would make me happy.  Speaking as a guy, and knowing that you're a girl and life is bit more complicated for you, all I suggest is to imagine yourself at 45 looking back at your life. Would you be happy following your parents' advice or would you resent them and be unhappy?   You only get to live your 20s once."
ABCDesis,3cvvu7,recycledpaper,4,Mon Jul 13 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what to make of your last paragraph there....getting married in your late 20s/early 30s is by no means the worst thing in the world (neither is getting married in school). Also those of us in that age bracket are not always old nor wrinkly. Also, probably don't plan your career around marriage.   So if you don't need your parents financial support then there's not much I can tell you besides ""just go do it"". Are you worried about your parents' disapproval? Because as I've said time and time again, people will give you crap for anything and everything so why not do it your way?   Also, to play devil's advocate here, maybe your family adores your uncle but possibly it's for different reasons than you think. They may fawn over him because he's the baby of the family and they sort of accept that he is just the sort to not go to school. Maybe they will eventually come around and be supportive of you at some point.   Just apply to schools broadly and don't let it pop out that you're applying specifically fashion stuff.   And this is my personal opinion and I'm sure some might disagree but I think if you're going the ""art"" route, it is not a terrible plan to pair it with something with very marketable skills (I had a friend who went to Parsons and could not find a job after graduation. Spent awhile travelling and now is studying accounting. Another friend majored in art and art history. Got a job with a museum.) I'm not telling you to back off from your dream but unlike your parents' suggestion of medicine/engineering, these choices are a little bit more difficult in terms of job security right out of school.   So what is the point of going to school if your parents won't let you work? Med school and engineering is expensive. And why do you think you can't/shouldn't work?"

So for people like them money is a far bigger barrier to education than their caste. Do you really believe that a rich or middle class lower caste kid would be denied entry to a good private school? The only language private schools in India speak is money.   Western society (specifically American) was able to escape the fuedal class structure    Hah, there was an institutionalized untouchability like system until the 60s and they only recently removed a symbol of slavery from a state capitol.

ABCDesis,3cv70s,coldcoldnovemberrain,3,Sun Jul 12 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"I have been taught that Hinduism as a religion encourages education and started out as a (pseudo)science (in the sense that it wanted to find out of what the universe was made up). I also thought that the whole point is to educate yourself on the universe and spirituality and decide for yourself what is true. Iirc, as Gandhi once said: ""Hinduism is the search for truth through non-violence"".   I'm not against religion, and it's great that it builds a community if people want to partake in that. However, my issue is that missionaries are in a position of power. They are often wealthy, educated and western. The poor are obviously not in a position of power. Imo, missionaries abuse and misuse their position of power for their own agenda, by basically indoctrinating the poor. They take advantage of the lack of agency & power that the poor have.   Even if missionary organizations bring education to poor people, it is unfair to me that these people have to give up their religion in order to receive education. That is unethical. Yes, there is absolute gain in the sense that poor people receive education/food/shelter. But look at what they have to give up, look at what they are 'guilted' into believing. That's not FAIR, it's a political agenda of missionaries and I personally think it's a very big deal.   To me, it's like missionaries are able to take away someone's religious freedom in return for education because they are more powerful/wealthy/educated than the poor. I can't overlook that and think missionaries are a-okay for at least educating the poor.  I'm not judging any poor people or tribal people for trying to access education.

The history of Christianity has been about conversion. You may argue that history has been written by the winner. But guess what  - we are conversing in English at the moment.   My argument about this issue has always been that rather than debating the activities of the foreign missionaries, why has the local community and governmental institutions not stepped up to provide the same resources which the missionaries are providing. There are some organizations like Akshar Patra and ISKON, but they are no match for heavily funded Christian Missionary organizations. Why has the Hindu religion not reformed to accept the the tribals or lower caste people as equals? Why are the SC/ST people always ridiculed and oppressed in modern India on topic of affirmative action programs specifically in India? Read any article of ""reservations in India"" and you will read some vapid comments from online users.   In several cases organizations like Bajrang Dal has always had a violent reaction to the missionary activities. If Bajrang Dal claims to represent the Hindus why have they not done more in fields of education and health services for the tribals or Orissa? They rather just go around burning churches and attacking schools. And the elite urban Indians tacitly support this, all the while enrolling their kids in Missionary run schools and colleges all over India, and consuming English media.   The debate should be about what is being done to uplift the downtrodden and neglected communities. I rather have people alive and educated (by that I mean literate in English), and healthy (access to missionary hospitals) than be dead if they have to refuse Christianity. Of course if they have choice, it is much better that they retains their heritage."

A lot of their high standards are a result of strong foundations from the colonial period. The actual missionary schools are not of great quality and are the ones people are always talking about.  Second, English - as another poster stated - does not help you much when you're in a village. I studied in one of the better schools in Chennai, a 'Hindu school', and everyone spoke pretty good English. OTOH people from St. John's, a school owned by a prayer group (or whatever they're called) spoke much worse English than us on an average. I'm still very unclear on why you linked English media or English education to missionaries.  Honestly, it all boils down to money, as another poster said. Caste still matters a lot yes, but in education I would say money overrides everything. I'm not from a high caste yet went a good school. Same goes for many others. Government schools take in everyone. The ones who can afford better, get it.

By saying that the country is filled with spiritual darkness, they are simply saying there are very few who believe in Christ.  This could be used to describe any other country where Christianity was not widespread.

If Hindu or non-Christian desis are so concerned why are they not mobilizing their own RSS or atheist organizations to bring aid to the helpless in India and other developing world.   When you are destitute and poor, who gives a fuck if you have accept Christ to get food, shelter and basic respect to live in the society. I know if I didn't have resources or connections,  I would gladly accept Christ if it meant an English education (colleges like St.St. Xaviers which are prevalent in South Asia) and access to a decent modern allopathic (non-Ayurvedic/Homeopathic/Natural stuff) hospital (mostly sponsored by catholic charities)"

Billions are budgeted for the uplift of these communities at the national and state level, and there is a sprawling bureaucracy that's supposed to do it.  Missionaries fracture communities and turn them against each other to spread the faith. Families are cleaved in two as heavy spending pours in from the west and relatives disown other relatives as heretics who have not seen the light. Militancy in NE India is largely attributable to this money tearing villages apart and instilling a new nationalism among converts.  Unemployed charlatans from the west travel to India for some poverty porn, change the religion of members of oppressed communities and call it a day. The government then has to deal with the resulting riots, houses being burned down, people being chased from their villages."

My dad was/is best friends with my mom's brother. So they'd see each other around but they never talked. My dad moves to the U.S. My mom happens to be visiting with her parents so they go pay my dad a visit. At this time my mom is 26 and obviously unmarried. She didn't want to go back to India and face all that marriage pressure again. So her parents let her stay in the U.S. to study. I still can't believe they let her do that! She decides to stay in the city my dad was living in. Of course they start spending more and more time together. He'd pick her up from the train station during the cold winters. She'd cook him Indian food he so desperately missed. They fall in love and decide they want to get married. Because of visa and financial issues, they couldn't go back to India to get married so they had a court marriage. Then they had a reception in India the year after. Never got to do the whole Hindu wedding thing.   I love their story because it makes me believe in fate. They'd known each other for 26 years but it took was a new country for those sparks to fly. It's also cool because a lot of my aunts, uncles, and cousins have memories of my dad before he became family. My mom still likes to mention how she always thought my dad was cute and how he'd never pay attention to her back when they were growing up in India. :)"

ABCDesis,3cu55o,analystdude,6,Sun Jul 12 06:39:05 2015 UTC,"My parents were living in England at the time, but they were both born in Nairobi, Kenya.   My mom was working in a sari shop and working in a factory doing inspection on modem boards. My dad was finishing his mechanics degree at Chelsea College. They were probably around the age of 23-26 at this time? They didn't know each other yet. My dad ended up getting a job offer in America after he graduated and moved to California. He would visit his parents back in Kenya every so often, and upon one visit he met my mom's oldest sister. My dad was looking to get married (first marriage failed but I don't know much about this since it's a taboo topic). She showed a picture of my mom to my dad and he flew to England to meet her. As my mom tells the story, ""he knocked on the door, proposed, and met my parents.""  Turns out both sides of my families had known of each other being from the same sect and the same small town in Kenya. So my moms parents obviously liked him because they knew what sect he was from and all that. And apparently they got married in court the next day, and since my dad still lived in America, he had to wait for my mom to get her VISA and becoming a dual citizen in England and America. She had to wait about a year for the VISA though, but in the mean time she stayed in England and worked while my dad wrote her letters almost every day. They'd call on the weekends. My mom ended up coming to California in April 1985. She was unemployed for a while but eventually got a job because of her inspection experience from England. She always says her experience moving here was terrifying--she didn't know anyone except my dad. Eventually she made Indian friends and all that, but she really made a big sacrifice. She still works doing parts inspection in factories, and my dads still a mechanic.   I don't have an exact idea of what my parents were like when they were younger, but it's always nice to see old photos of them because they look so fresh and jubilant. I know my dad had once taken my mom to space mountain at Disneyland (something they'd never do today). Now since they're a lot older, they're a lot different lol.   Awesome question!"

When my siblings were young and I hadn't arrived in the picture my parents would do all sorts of random travelling to all sorts of places. They once wound up in Greenland even.  Once I was born everything slowed down a bit bar the usual annual summer trip here and there. Now that I'm out of the house for college and everyone else is settled, though, they're gradually getting more spontaneous like they once were. I guess responsibility wears down some people."

ABCDesis,3cu55o,JenniferHewitt,4,Sat Jul 11 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"Yup. It was a pretty rushed affair because my dad's relatives were leaving for America soon. The wedding date was planned to be a week after both parties said yes. There was no time for my parents to meet. I do believe they saw pictures of each other, although my mother doesn't quite remember much apart from hating the fact that she had to move to America.   They are both fiercely loyal/obedient to their parents though. It's probably the biggest thing they have in common. My dad said he didn't need to see my mom because his parents chose her for him and they were always right in his mind. My mom felt the same way. My grandmother consoled my mom about moving away from India because she said she would get to see the world. She agreed and strangely enough, it's held true. She's traveled all over the world because of my dad's work. It's funny how things work like that sometimes."
ABCDesis,3cu55o,book-of-kells,5,Sun Jul 12 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"I always joke we were the only Indians who immigrated to the USA to go back to India.  My father was an unwilling USA-goer - he only went to study there because his father pressured him to. He would've much rather stayed in India. At the end of his stay there, when he was looking for a job, he had a terrible accident. After that, his parents were suddenly unwilling to let him go anywhere outside of Madras. Still, he married mother (officially arranged, but they still have love-letters from the time that they were betrothed) and then I was born and his company sent him to the USA. Mother was most unwilling since she was afraid and did not want to leave Madras. They stayed for a couple of years, but my father had too much honour to apply for a job while there like his friends urged him too. He said his company had sent him with the understanding that he would go back.   But when father came back he realised that the kind of career he wanted was unavailable at the time in India. He was sent to Northern Europe for an assignment and was encouraged to apply for a job there, and got it. This job was a permanent contract, so we all moved there, though it was actually still against mother's will, she also believed that it was her good wifely duty to comply. Dad was also the type of person who didn't want to do the 'mainstream' thing so it was totally his type of action to apply for a job in Europe instead of the USA."

They were introduced to each other at a wedding as one of my mom's cousins thought they would be a good match. My mom says it was love at first sight and after 2 months they got engaged.   My mom lived in the south of the Netherlands with her parents, and my dad lived with his cousins in Amsterdam. My mom would take the train and they would spend a day together in Amsterdam or my dad would take the train and spend the day with my mom and her siblings & parents.   After 9 months (total) they got married. My mom wore an orange sari instead of the traditional red, she still wears this for certain pujas. They found an apartment in Amsterdam and were able to move in right after marriage. Their first trip was to Paris when they just got married.   My uncles say my dad was the only one not drinking/partying when they all lived together in the 70s, so he was a bit more serious than his peers when he was younger. My mom was very smart and independent when she was younger (she still is), she's the 3rd child out of 10 and was a nurse so she knows how to handle things.  They have been happily married for 38 years now :)"

ABCDesis,3cu55o,asdfioho,6,Sat Jul 11 13:15:51 2015 UTC,"OP here, might as well chime in.  January 1985:  Mom was 20, studying at McGill in Montreal. Dad was born in Montreal in 1954 but only because grandfather was stationed there.  They had retained the house in that city and my dad was off for winter from his medical postdoc specialization in the UK, so he just decided to go to Montreal. Got tired of sitting around and so he decided to do some basic TA work at McGill (his undergrad alma mater). Ended up supervising my mother for one of her basic biology courses. Mother thought he was an absolute moron at first, but nevertheless accepted his invitation to take her to dinner eventually. Courtship followed for a few months, and they fell in love, before my dad had to get back to the UK. My dad's Montreal friends describe the courtship period as the worst of their lives because they never saw my father for more than 5 minutes at a time.  My dad was supposed to graduate and get his FRCS in October of that year, but he had finished his coursework by August. So one night, sitting in his dorm room in September, he wrote to his dean asking to skip convocation and flew to Montreal. Asked a friend to open up his metallurgy shop so he could melt some gold he had on him into a ring, and he then went to a jeweller to add the diamond.  He proposed on September 25th. My mom said yes almost immediately. But in order to make sure he hadn't crossed any boundaries, he first asked his own parents if it was okay, before flying to Pakistan to ask my maternal grandparents for my mom's hand. This part is tricky because he had already proposed, but my grandparents thought he was simply doing the first step of asking for her hand, when in fact it was in reverse.  My grandfather was impressed with him but nonetheless grilled him for almost two hours (he says now it was because of the age difference between the two). My grandmother eventually defused the situation when she asked my dad what his mother's last name was, and what clan she belonged to. It turns out both my grandmothers were Dars, and so she was elated immediately and gave her blessings.  My mom had to take some time off from school but eventually they got married in November 1985 in Pakistan. In the summer of 1986 they moved to England."

So my Nanaji placed an ad in the newspaper in India. My Papaji (dad's father) responded to the ad. I found letters between my grandparents in my cousin's basement. Had a fun time reading them. They were overly formal and just stating how excited each of them were to meet each other. My mom went to India a few times to visit my dad and his family.

ABCDesis,3csjcc,coconutmango,3,Sat Jul 11 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"Whaaaa? Is that a real statistic? If so, that's absurd. A lot of first generation Hindus I know in America do stray from their parents beliefs though, so I can see how/why they are undereducated about their religious roots."
ABCDesis,3csjcc,coconutmango,0,Sat Jul 11 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"It's not. I'm probably exaggerating it. But I wouldn't be surprised if it is true. Since Hinduism has become just mindless chanting of mantras in Temple without talking about the true meaning of them. And some gurujis and babas manipulate the gullible by being like, ""Give me 100 rupees and you will be blessed! If you don't, you're fucked!""  Many people even forget the fact that Hinduism is pro LGBT. HINDUS are not. Why? Because of the reason above. And even some of the Gurujis and Babas do know that Hinduism is pro-LGBT, they can care less since in the short run they can make some quick cash by doing so-called, ""yoga healings."" Hmm... what religion does this seem the most familiar to? It starts with a C. And this influence came ultimately from the Victorian era rule of India with their brainwashing and teaching of this in British textbooks in schools. What is sad is that modern day Britain has mostly moved on, haven't they? And their bad influence of hate and bigotry has lived on! This also extends to things such as sex, which was considered a natural process of humans. What about weed? For fucks sake, it is one of the 5 sacred plants in Hinduism as a gift from the gods. It came from a story of Shiva accidentally coming across it and getting high. For fucks sake, Shiva became a big pothead afterwards! The concept of sin and shame came from the British as well. I am not sure about the Taboo of alcohol, but there is evidence to show that it was quite existant in ancient society with good prevalence. Sex education is evident as well from temples such as khajuraho and the kama sutra. Hinduism teaches that if you fuck up, you are not fucked entirely. You still have a chance. And regarding weed and alcohol, they say that one should understand his/her limits. Hmm... Sounds familiar to what liberals today say, right?  Here is an article about skin color obsession.  Read...   In Christianity, the color white symbolizes Christ, purity, spirituality and good while black symbolizes Satan, the diabolical, carnality and evil.   (Bastide) However, Hinduism carries no such connotations for the colors black and white.   Guess who brought that? Hmm...  Let's talk about women's rights in ancient India. Women were highly respected during the vedic period. In the Lakshmi Tantra it says, ""A man of piety free from sin, consistently adhering to the precepts of the sacred Scriptures, performs those deeds that are not condemned by women and that please them.""  ""A yogi should never abuse a woman, either in deed, speech or thought. Wherever I (Lakshmi) am, the realities are, wherever I am the gods too are.""  Hmm... meanwhile in christianity and islam, a woman's duty is only to please a man they say.  What else? Oh yeah, Sati.   Sati is an example of how Popular Indian History (spread through pseudo-secular school textbooks) has twisted everything to not hurt Muslim identity by not blaming Muslim invaders of crimes against women.  Sati was a symptom of the root-cause of blatant objectification of women.  Women were treated no different from inflatable sex dolls and were taken in prisoners of wars or sex slaves for soldiers. (Just like today!?)  To reduce the probability of this happening, many communities started marrying off their pre-pubescent daughters now known as child-marriage. If the woman got widowed, she was seen as public property.  Like many of the answers here have already pointed out, it was preferable for them and their associated families to kill them with their 'honour' intact.   Atheism? Look up the Carvaka school of thought. It is an atheist school of thought that exist during the ancient times and nobody was against it. Meanwhile, you should see what is done to atheists in other religions.  Any other questions? Look, I don't hate Muslims and Christians. I dislike pseudo-seculars, and people who have assumptions and misunderstanding of things. I don't care if 1st generation ABCDs are Hindu or are not or anyone is. I am trying to save the legacy and greatness of the ancestors. I just want people to give due respect to ancestors in India who were ahead of the time. And these so-called, ""secular, progressive, etc"" expressions can describe the Santana Dharma (Hinduism). I just want people to ACKNOWLEDGE that. That is all.  The funny thing is that we are seeing a phenomenon where the west is unknowingly following ancient Hindu traditions and coining them as ""progressive"" while false-Hindus are taking ancient western ideals and coining it as theirs."
ABCDesis,3csjcc,coldcoldnovemberrain,2,Sat Jul 11 01:28:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, I enjoyed reading it.   I was going to mention too how Hindus are shady against LBGT meanwhile Gurus are welcoming of them. I sometimes think the religion is so mixed with cultural and societal view points (maybe I'm just assuming this from personal life).    And some gurujis and babas manipulate the gullible by being like, ""Give me 100 rupees and you will be blessed! If you don't, you're fucked!""   This reminded me of how some of my Aunts had a Hindu priest come over to their house and he did a bunch of mantras and astrology readings on their children's future (he had to get their time and date of birth). He asked for money, which apparently he is going to take to India to some Baba's holy site or something. I'm not exactly sure on the details. If he's actually going to take it to where he says he is, I don't know. Just something that popped into my head when you mentioned that."

I honestly dont think its all that bad anymore, what Nikki Haley (and Bobby Jindal) have transformed into en route to the way of their respective governorships.  Dont get me wrong - I would have GREATLY preferred that Nikki and Bobby retain much much more of their ethnic heritage. I would have loved to see these two politicians at the frontlines of the movement to elevate the perception of South Asians in this country...but that's not gonna happen. Thats not who they are. They dont want to be trailblazers for an ethnic movement. And honestly, they shouldnt be if they dont want to be.  Why force them into being something they were clearly never meant to be?  So I disagree with the author here.  Let Nikki be who she wants to be. At the very least, we should be appreciative of her and Bobby for being trailblazers for our kind."

ABCDesis,3crp0j,house7890,13,Fri Jul 10 05:59:33 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you count, I'm either 3rd or 4th generation in North America (great-grandpa made the journey over 100 yrs. ago).  So in many ways I was born already assimilated into Canada.  At times when I was growing up I barely even noticed that we weren't white.  My family felt pretty similar to those of all the white kids because my parents had spent their entire lives here.  We were always doing normal ""Canadian"" stuff way more than we did ""Punjabi"" stuff.  Of course as I got older, I had experiences that shattered the illusion that I could ever just be ""another white guy,"" no matter how long my family had been in the country.  Anyways, as someone who never really had a choice about being an assimilated Canadian, I've always seen the decision between ""being assimilated"" or ""embracing your Indianness"" as a false choice.  If you so choose, you can do both (or just one, or neither) to the degree that it personally satisfies you, and that's all that matters.  I concede it's definitely not always that simple when family is involved and sometimes tough decisions do have to be made about your values.  But on a more superficial level, you can friggin' be whoever you want to be.  No one is a ""bad indian"" for not liking spicy food (okay, maybe that one's debatable haha), and at the same time you're not an unassimilated American just because you do Hindu stuff or watch Bollywood.    I believe you can be fully integrated with American, Canadian, British etc. culture and still take full ownership of your ""Indianness"", your ethnic heritage, your religion, or whatever you wanna call it.  Take ownership of both. Embrace both to the extreme, or not at all, if you want.  Mix and match and choose whatever aspects identify with you.  Just like, um, be yourself I guess."

Assuming 1st gen means naturalized, the earliest 1st gen Indian Americans would have come here during the 60s (or perhaps even late 50s). Assuming they bore children right away, then those 2nd gen Indian-Americans would bear their 3rd gen children in the 80s/90s.  So over the enxt few years the first 4th gen kids would be born. Interesting :-)  [sorry about this being slightly off-topic]"

The fact that you grew up around non-desis, consume western media/entertainment and indirectly Western philosophies will certainly shape you into someone who will not be exactly the same as someone from South Asia.

ABCDesis,3crp0j,kwoosh,3,Fri Jul 10 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"My identity is a bit complicated as I'm a 4th generation Indian born in South Africa but raised in the Uk, my family were indentured labourers in South Africa, but currently my family and I live in the UK. My sister and I discuss our cultural heritage and identity quite often, as I think that being this removed from our original heritage has created quite a dichotomy in the way in which we view ourselves.   When we're in South Africa visiting our family, we are surrounded by mainly Indians, probably a result of the Apartheid because they grew up being identified solely on their racial and cultural identity, being termed as ""Indian"" by the SA government. This idea has been reinforced as many of the South African Indians we've come into contact with identify themselves as being Indian first, South African second. They immerse themselves as much as possible in what they deem to be traditional Indian culture: Bollywood, religion, frequent trips to India, wearing bindis or saris everyday.  For me and my sister, it is quite a strange phenomenon, as we have kind of taken a step back from this culture. The thing that I find weird, is that many of these people are also third or fourth generations, yet identify so strongly as Indian, whereas my experience in the UK has been  vastly different.  I live in an area of the UK where when I was growing up I was the only ethnic person in my year, and was always called upon to highlight the ''ethnic diversity'' of my school. When I first arrived, of course I was picked on for being ''paki' or a terrorist, whatever, but that got old soon. I think that amongst my friends, my race is hardly noted, and i've assimilated myself well enough to the point that it's not an issue for me. I have had problems when trying to date, as some men seem to have a fetish for dating non-whites, and in some ways I've become insecure about this. I would say in terms of my cultural values, I have an inside identity and an outside identity. By that I mean, when Im inside my home, I allow my to indulge on the things that in SA would be considered Indian - pray at the lamp, watch Bollywood etc. and outside the home, I tend to indulge in typical British behaviour.   Sometimes, it can be confusing when I'm in SA because I dont think my family considers my sister and I to be Indian, as we have been painted with the European brush, and often we are given exemptions from things because they know that's not how we do it in the UK.  Incidentally, I think it's worth noting that I don't consider myself Indian. I went to India when I was a child and said to a local I was Indian, and he set me straight by saying I am not indian, as I was not born in India. So now I call myself South Asian, and am trying to spread this message to the 'Indians' in South Africa."

ABCDesis,3crp0j,IAteQuarters,2,Sun Jul 12 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"We're the largest amount of Indians outside of India. During the Apartheid we were considered Indian, Coloureds are a completely distinct racial group, of mixed and Malay descent. In the hierarchy of the Apartheid, Indians were placed second to the whites with Coloureds and Blacks underneath; this meant that we got much more privileges than other race groups, and tended to be better educated and have more money. Because of this 'favouritism', in the post-Apartheid SA there is a lot of resentment towards Indians, by blacks as they feel that we were already privileged and don't need to be included in the affirmative action acts currently in use. By the same token, whites are often resentful of Indians for the exact same reason, so Indians have become quite insular in terms of racial mixing, and it's propelled the sentiment to the homeland.   It's quite an interesting situation, and there have been a lot of studies on South African Indians, if you're interested in these or even some non-fiction writing I can point you in the right direction :)"

Yes I speak Hindi with my family but that's the extent of my cultural ties.  You grew up in America. Your friends are American. You are an American. Just because your color isn't black or white doesn't mean you can align yourself with American values much like you don't have to align yourself with Indian values because you are brown.   You're not a bad Indian. If you don't enjoy the culture, or have any interest in it, so be it.

My grandparents did not consider eggs vegetarian. Heck my grandpa will not eat mushrooms, insists that they are meat and we are not Jain. (My Jain friends who had their parents living with them were puzzled when I mentioned it.) Ritual contamination is definitely a thing. Pure vegetarian and pure vegetarian food made by upper caste people is a niche in restaurants in India.    And eggs... definitely take getting used to. Cook it too much in an egg curry and you lose the taste. Cook it too little and you risk bacteria.  Plus food contamination as in cleanliness is an issue.  I don't eat raw fruit or cold milk or buttermilk or water from the tap or ice cream when I'm in India.

The contribution for the meal came from the village community itself and sounded a virtual bugle of defiance against the Chief Minister, who for personal reasons had been resisting serving of eggs in a State where about 52 per cent of the children are malnourished.  The distribution of eggs also proved a great crowd-puller as a large number of enthusiastic children made a beeline for their school on hearing that they would be served eggs during the day. In the meal they were also served khichri (a dish made of cooked rice and lentils) along with bananas for the pure vegetarians. But in a cheerful and charged atmosphere, most of the children opted for the egg."

First of all these mid-day meal schemes are run on a tight-budget and they have to provide a nutritious and healthy meal within that budget. The article writer is demanding the kids should be given options, but conveniently forgets in-order to give options to the kids they have to up their budget too. So it's a far better alternative to have a fixed meal that has all the nutritional values and acceptable by everybody. Many people in that state are vegetarian owing to religious reasons and those kids will be missing out on protein based food if egg is made mandatory, cause their parents will simply forbid them from eating it. Options are good but only if you can afford it. As long as kids are provided proper alternative source of protein, their should be no complaints.

It is so painstakingly frustrating to explain to these people how eggs are non-fertilized and non-living. Not wanting to eat animal products (veganism) is one thing, not wanting to eat an unfertilized because you conflate it with an egg with a fetus in it is just plain stupidity. I swear one of my friends said ""yeah, well, who knows, science could be wrong and there could be a living animal inside the egg."" Our version of creationism..."
ABCDesis,3cpuc6,asdfioho,7,Thu Jul 9 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"For many Hindus, not eating eggs isn't just an ahimsa/nonviolence issue, but also a purity issue. Traditionally in Hinduism/in Ayurveda, foods are classified as sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic (foods in the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance respectively). Eggs are traditionally considered to be tamasic or impure.   Many Hindu rituals have a large focus on purity. Many strict Hindus would not eat eggs even if they are unfertilized because it's considered to be the bird version of a menstrual waste product, although cow's milk is considered as pure or sattvic. There are some Hindus that also don't eat onions or garlic and consider them tamasic because they're considered to be aphrodisiacs that would cause the mind to be more restless, creating difficulties in meditation.  Having said that, this doesn't apply to everybody necessarily. Typically, the groups that would follow the strict diet of lacto-vegetarian, no onions and garlic would be Jains (who have even more dietary restrictions), certain monastic Buddhist groups, strict Brahmins, strict Vaishnava Hindus (who would belong to any caste), certain strict North Indian Hindus of the business Vaishya caste, and apparently, Bengali widows (and a few more groups I might have forgotten)."

I was actually talking about vegetarian Sikhs, most of whom cite that killing animals is not humane, and thus neither is eating eggs. This is particularly rampant among Sikhs that go to Dera babas in Punjab, as most of the Deras prescribe vegetarianism and especially anti-eggs.  It seems that the anti-egg attitude is a cultural relic from the Hindu background of many Sikhs before they converted and they just kind of pseudo-rationalized it."

ABCDesis,3cpuc6,book-of-kells,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"Well, even among some who eat meat, there's an attitude similar to that of alcohol consumption--its well known that it's technically against Sikhi, but it's done anyways because people don't follow all the religious tenants. However, these people would expect someone who calls themselves religious or has taken Amrit (baptism) to be vegetarian, if that makes sense (although the official code of conduct for baptized Sikhs permits meat). Historically, Sikhs seemed to eat meat with no problem, but in the modern community it's a strong belief among many. However, all Sikhs historically and in the present can definitely agree that meat slaughtered the Muslim way (halal) or any religiously slaughtered meat like Kosher is expressly and explicitly forbidden.   I actually have a [Mohyal] Punjabi Brahmin friend and when we went to their house we all ate a TON of chicken and fish. Not sure about how it is for Saraswat Brahmins (the other major Punjabi Brahmin population), but most Mohyal Brahmins have more of a culture akin to landowning Punjabis than priestly classes in other parts of India."

I didn't know that there was such a thing as unfertilized eggs and that in the US, all eggs are unfertilized because the roosters and hens are kept separate.  This might be another reason, but I'm not too sure. While the US is strict on keeping roosters and hens apart so that the eggs are unfertilized, India might not be as strict as the US in that regards. I remember reading somewhere that India is not as strict when it comes to keeping roosters and hens apart, so when the hens are laying eggs, there's no way to make sure if it's an unfertilized egg or a fertilized egg, so they still might be worried they're eating a fertilized egg, even in the US.

Summary to discuss (taken from another poster):  On the anniversary of the 7/7 terrorist attacks, this author claims that Islam in the UK is far less accepting and moderate than in other Western countries, such as the U.S.  What's more, she believes that British Islam is getting progressively more extreme and less tolerant of non-Muslim values."

It's important to rant now and then, but there is a much deeper, more nuanced, compassionate, and sophisticated discussion that needs to be had about this issue.  As tl;dr as I can do this: Yes, don't obey your parents blindly.  But for goodness' sake have some compassion for the fact that they're victims, too.  And that they grew up in a totally different world than you did where even expressing rebellion wasn't a practical option.  The amount of repression and suppression of feelings that many of our parents had to do would bring you to tears, if you could spend even one moment in their hearts.  They've just become extremely good at ignoring even their own feelings, causing them to behave the way they do and blindly repeat the problem.  Does it excuse them?  No.  Does it mean your feelings need to be ignored?  Not at all, you do deserve and need compassion.  But so do they.  Hatred, anger, and lashing out at them--when you understand this issue more deeply--is precisely the opposite of what's needed to end this cycle.

I should say, none of the Indian staff complained, the art director said the painting will be moved eventually with renovations, it just happened to be the best space available for the painting that would offer max visibility (seriously though... So ugly) and soon after that they made these cool little posters for everyone in the IT department (Americans and Indians) that said their name, their photo and several facts about them.  It really got everyone talking and joking and I thought it was an awesome idea."

In both cases the secretary is making an assumption that you (or your cubemate) would be more comfortable with another Indian guy. Seems pretty benign.  OTOH, I'm not sure why they stuck all the other Indian programmers on one floor. I know there's a clash between the American born programmers and the Indian programmers (I hear lots of people complain about HB-1 visas). It may all be just benign in intent, but it does reinforce the stereotype of Indians being clannish. YMMV."

If you perceived it as such and wanted to see it changed, then you ought to have talked to the staffer in private. Obviously, it could be for other reasons- all people working on that floor may have been working on the same project, may be part of a group that is all Indian, etc.  I think the big issue here is about intention. Racism and segregation isn't about intentionality. IMO, it's not really for anyone else to decide whether something is racist or discriminatory besides you. (The person who receives the effect) While it's definitely commendable of you to ask for our opinions, people's understandings and experiences of racism vary widely, and thus our opinions might not be relevant to your understanding of the issue."
ABCDesis,3coa8y,eyeearsaar,2,Thu Jul 9 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"I (Bombay lad) currently work in upstate NY in a tech company with perhaps a culture much different from GE. I haven't yet come across such segregation, we have individual cubicles and I am a good 10 cubes away from the nearest Indian, everyone is seated according to their teams. We do have few Indian interns as well but even they are seated near their teams and not beside each other, funnily enough all of them prefer to hangout with each other whenever they are not working.   So I would say its not just the person's culture but the company's culture that plays a part in how these things work out. It would be interesting to see if someone can confirm or deny if Silicon Valley , which is considered to have a relatively no-nonsense and open culture, also has such divisions."

You cannot blame a severely mentally ill person for public masturbation any more than you can blame a 6 month old for not being toilet trained. There are people who cannot understand impulse control or social norms, and as long as we, as a society, are leaving them out on the street and not providing care, public masturbation will happen.  Telling them to ""get a sense of decency"" or tossing people in jail achieves little. One of the legal travesties we have is that people like this end up on the sex offenders database, and are then faced with vanishingly few options to ever leave that life, and of course they find themselves in the same position repeating the same behavior. (If you ever look up the database, you'll find that it's mainly homeless and mentally ill people.) If they get picked up by the police in India, they get beaten and mistreated, and then thrown back out on the street, where they repeat their actions.

ABCDesis,3cj32z,analystdude,13,Wed Jul 8 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"So when one or two people do it, the whole country is accountable for it?"
ABCDesis,3cj32z,wiigamer136,-13,Wed Jul 8 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"If one or two people are comfortable enough to masturbate in public without fearing repercussion, especially when there are literally no laws penalizing such behavior, that is indicative of a wider problem."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,9,Wed Jul 8 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"So this is the thing. I've seen tons of public masturbation in both the US and South Asia. None in the ""socialist"" part of Europe.  It's not because the US and South Asia lack laws and enforcement. It's that a large amount of the public masturbation is done by mentally ill, intellectually disabled, people who struggle with substances, or homeless people. We have less of a social safety net, so these groups people are likely to be living outside, or even if they have a home, have little care and guidance.  In countries where there's a lot less homelessness and near-guaranteed care for mental illness and disability and addiction, there's a lot less public masturbation as well."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,serenissima_regina,8,Wed Jul 8 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"There are incidents of public masturbation here in the good ole US as well. Hell, I remember watching Jay Leno make fun of a judge that was caught masturbating in the middle of court.  A few incidents do not necessarily define a whole country."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,kinsho,-8,Wed Jul 8 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"I suppose until more of these cases are reported, we will have to agree to disagree on the frequency of these incidents."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,3,Wed Jul 8 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Do you know what else we don't have a specific law for? Child molestation. Right now it's prosecuted under a law for unnatural acts or something like that. Doesn't mean that anyone in India condones child molestation. Most of the law we have right now has evolved from the British law before Independence. Things have been added, removed or modified as the need arises. I don't think there is a pandemic of public masturbation going on. So no one is spending their time to write a law to address it specifically."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,trctn4238934,3,Wed Jul 8 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"no laws penalizing such behavior   There are, but do you really think the police do their job in India?"
ABCDesis,3cj32z,wiigamer136,-12,Wed Jul 8 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"According to the article there is no specific law against public masturbation. If you know of it, please correct me because I ran a quick google search and didn't find anything.  And no, I don't think the police do their job in India, nor do they have the sensitivity training to handle such cases. That is part of the problem."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,5,Wed Jul 8 14:40:49 2015 UTC,Not specific. But there are laws pertaining to appropriate public behavior which probably shadows masturbation.
ABCDesis,3cj32z,wiigamer136,-6,Wed Jul 8 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"A law that ""probably shadows"" a specific indecent act does not do enough to condemn such behavior."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,4,Wed Jul 8 15:52:43 2015 UTC,I'm sure that it does enough but what do you expect from the police and their (lack of) enforcement? I think that is the problem!
ABCDesis,3cj32z,wiigamer136,-12,Wed Jul 8 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"It's not just the police, it's a wider societal issue.  This chain started with your assertion that it's only a problem of ""one or two people"". That claim in and of itself shows just how deep-seated the public impression is. Police aren't going to enforce a law when the culture doesn't recognize the problem."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,9,Wed Jul 8 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"I really, really, really doubt that public masturbation is considered acceptable in India. This is the country that busts couples for PDA."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,serenissima_regina,-5,Wed Jul 8 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah it sure is. Nobody condones  it, but nobody says anything against it either! People just stand there and do nothing. This applies to all things. Not just public masturbation.  What grinds my gears is when people claim that it is not considered an issue in so called ""culture."" the problem is the lack of speaking out."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,wiigamer136,2,Wed Jul 8 16:22:28 2015 UTC,I think guns here are the bigger problem. Its pleasure vs pain people. We had another one in Chicago on the 4th.

ABCDesis,3cj32z,hahaheehaha,11,Wed Jul 8 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how that makes a difference. Are men less aware of other people masturbating in public? Truth be told, I'm pretty sure guys can spot other guys masturbating a lot easier then other women would.   Unless this was a joke or sarcasm then this is the biggest WHOOSH ever seen on this sub."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,Anandya,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:43:42 2015 UTC,More like the problem doesn't seem to be guys masturbating to other guys.
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,-4,Thu Jul 9 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"You would think, but in general I think men are blind to sexual harassment unless and until they see it affect someone they know directly.  One time I was flashed on a subway and when I told my guy friends, they just laughed, like it was a joke. Never mind that it was actually a criminal offense! I can see how a guy masturbating in public wouldn't register as much as it would to a man as it would for a woman."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,serenissima_regina,9,Wed Jul 8 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"As you may know, I am a woman, and I don't think I've ever seen masturbation done to harass women, so I think it's worth acknowledging that while you might have a certain experience, and you should definitely share your experience, it doesn't necessarily fall along gender lines and shouldn't be generalized.  What I've seen are mentally ill or homeless people taking care of their needs. When it comes to disabled people, you do need to have different expectations for impulse control. There are people who fundamentally cannot understand what proper sexuality or privacy is. If you ever work in a shelter or food bank, a few people will pop a boner etc. etc., but it's usually because of their intellectual limitations.  We were talking about this just now, but masturbation as sexual harassment is uncommon because a lot of sexual harassment is about power, and being mid-wank is not a position of power."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,oh-just-another-guy,3,Wed Jul 8 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"and being mid-wank is not a position of power.   :-) Sorry, not to deviate from the topic, but I found that funny!"
ABCDesis,3cj32z,hahaheehaha,6,Wed Jul 8 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying now. Yes, sexual harassment is directed at women a lot more, I agree with that. I assumed you were strictly talking about public masturbation."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,Misspells_Stuff,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:43 2015 UTC,Finding new and creative ways to make me feel ashamed once again!   But in a country of 1.3 billion of which 1/3 are basically in poverty just about everything is to be expected.

ABCDesis,3cj32z,oh-just-another-guy,5,Wed Jul 8 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"Feeling ashamed because of someone else's actions is not the country's problem, that's yours   Probably meant he/she feels ashamed at the standard of journalism."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,-7,Wed Jul 8 13:24:09 2015 UTC,Interesting. What do you suggest should have been done to improve the standard of reporting?
ABCDesis,3cj32z,oh-just-another-guy,9,Wed Jul 8 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"For starters, use a title that's not grossly exaggerated and over-generalized."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,-6,Wed Jul 8 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"For starters, journalists aren't responsible for the headline. That's entirely on the editor/website.  Secondly, what indication is there that the title is sensationalist? Clearly this is behavior that is not punishable by law, and the fact that even just a few perpetrators (if this really is a problem of a minority bad actors) feel openly comfortable about their behavior indicates that this is an issue.  The one quibble I have with the headline is the assertion that there are ""no real solutions"". There are, but it is up to Indian society to implement them, something that seems like a cultural difficulty at this point -  starting with the fact that so many people don't even seem to think this is a real issue. It takes recognizing a problem to effect change."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,oh-just-another-guy,3,Wed Jul 8 15:26:51 2015 UTC,"Well I meant the whole package (writer + editor).  To extrapolate one incident to a country-wide problem is clearly exaggeration.  India has laws against public nudity and obscenity. In fact, you could be arrested for kissing in public or even holding hands with someone of the opposite gender. So it's not that there's nothing unlawful about someone masturbating in public."
ABCDesis,3cj32z,frackaracka,-6,Wed Jul 8 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"To extrapolate one incident to a country-wide problem is clearly exaggeration.   I think you will find many, many women who have multiple accounts of this ""one incident"".   India has laws against public nudity and obscenity. In fact, you could be arrested for kissing in public or even holding hands with someone of the opposite gender. So it's not that there's nothing unlawful about someone masturbating in public.   Okay. So then that begs the question of why this is a problem that isn't being punished by law?  In other words, is it more likely that someone can be arrested for holding hands in public than masturbating? And if so, how is this not indicative of a larger problem, as per the article headline (which appears to be your main contention at this point)?"
ABCDesis,3cj32z,oh-just-another-guy,2,Wed Jul 8 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"I guess very few cases get reported. Lack of evidence. It all adds up.  Perhaps if we had more CCTVs across the coutry, a few of these idiots would get arrested and then maybe anyone else trying this would rethink."

ABCDesis,3cg5av,the_brown_stockton,-8,Wed Jul 8 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"No there are not. The vast majority of people on this sub are either non-Muslim or non-practicing Muslims. Their cultural/political leanings are likely already in lockstep with liberals on such issues as gay marriage. An article titled ""An open letter to American Muslims on same sex Marriage"" is directly talking to people who are opposed to it or who are apprehensive about it based on their religious beliefs. Posting this article to r/ABCDesis is basically giving a khuthba to the jamat (my way of saying preaching to the choir)."
ABCDesis,3cg5av,TeslaModelE,5,Wed Jul 8 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"In a survey conducted seven months ago (when we had around 1600 users), we found that Islam was the second largest religious representation on here (discounting atheism and agnosticism). Issues pertaining to Muslims, certainly when they represent a significant chunk of the subcontinent and the users here are valid. To say this only belongs in /r/Islam is to discredit the importance of Islam in South Asia.   No need to get your lungi in a bunch."
ABCDesis,3cg5av,GWmyc2,-7,Wed Jul 8 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing, you cannot discount atheism and agnosticism.  Identifying as Muslim and being a Muslim are two very different things. You yourself admitted that you don't feel comfortable identifying as Muslim because you are so far removed from the doctrine.   Like I said, anyone on the sub likely already agrees with the authors words regarding gay marriage. Just preaching to the choir.  Lastly, Reza Aslan might not even be a Muslim. He actually rejects one of the core beliefs regarding the life of prophet Jesus."
ABCDesis,3cg5av,TeslaModelE,4,Wed Jul 8 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"Like I said, anyone on the sub likely already agrees with the authors words regarding gay marriage. Just preaching to the choir.    Yes, that may be true but can't you say that about a lot of posts on here? Most of us know misogyny is bad and that racism is terrible. I've still found value in articles posted about those topics because I'm learning something new. Plus it provides me with new points to back up my stance when I'm talking to people with dissenting views. A majority of this sub may agree with the article, but you forget that they may have older relatives that don't. Maybe someone on here is struggling to come to terms with their sexuality and practicing Islam. I posted this here in the hopes that it creates a dialogue not just on this sub but within our communities in real life.   Aside from all that, I also thought the article had an interesting point on being a minority:    But here’s the thing. When you are an underrepresented minority—whether Muslim, African American, female, etc.—democracy is an all or nothing business. You fight for everyone’s rights (and the operative word here is “fight”), or you get none for yourself. Democracy isn’t a buffet. You can’t pick and choose which civil liberties apply to which people. Either we are all equal, or the whole thing is just a sham."
ABCDesis,3cg5av,GWmyc2,7,Thu Jul 9 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't be holding me up as the typical Muslim user on here - I don't fit that and it's an insult to practicing Muslims and their faith.  And who gives a damn if it's preaching to the choir? One of our users on here thought it was pertinent and not one mod found it to be off-topic. If it bothers you so much, report it and move on."
ABCDesis,3cg5av,the_brown_stockton,5,Wed Jul 8 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"In the survey conducted, Islam was the second biggest religion in this sub, so stop talking out of your ass. Regardless of what you think, this article is relevant here because of the amount of American Muslims who frequent here."

There are posts about how helicopter parenting can cause mental health issues, and while it doesn't have to do with this subreddit or Desis specifically, many Desi people are brought up in that environment so it can be useful to see what this subreddit thinks about those types of articles.

My mom was around so her initial reaction was that I had done badly in school and that that was the reason I was upset. Cue the marks interrogation. I then went on to blubber about Wally, and while she didn't say anything, she was definitely giving me desi-mom stink eye with an expression along the lines of ""were you dating some dude named Wally"".  I did eventually explain the situation to her properly, and she was cool with it. She's known that my sister and I have loved cartoons/comics since we were kids and every so often she'll point out something when we're out to show us she knows what we like, which is sweet. The other day I heard her telling my dad about how Assassin's Creed was my favourite game."

ABCDesis,3cel4x,pee_boy,6,Tue Jul 7 08:32:05 2015 UTC,"What an odd article.  ""On one hand are liberal Hindus, who seek a fair, open democracy and the right to free living and decision-making for all, including but not limited to Hindus. On the other, those who stand fiercely by the concrete morals spelled out by advocates of conservative, traditional Hinduism that they believe are truly Hindu.""  Uh...just like liberals and conservatives in any group?   BAPS, despite its “logical” understanding of Hinduism, advocates abstinence from alcohol and non-vegetarian food. While I don’t drink myself, I don’t see why religion should dictate personal choices. Would lifestyle decisions change if we decide to convert tomorrow?   uh...yes? I mean, that's kind of the point of converting to another religion...religion is by many definitions a philosophy that should dictate some if not many of your personal choices. If you believe in ahimsa, a religious principle in Hinduism, yes, you should probably choose to not eat animals. Maybe it's different with Hinduism, but I have absolutely no clue what she is saying here, unless she considers Hinduism an ethnic religion."
ABCDesis,3cel4x,asdfioho,4,Tue Jul 7 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Articles like these make me want to visit Nepal and see how they practice Hinduism. Supposedly Hinduism there was less touched by the practices of the conquerors over the centuries and is closer to how it was practiced in ancient India.   There's another article linked in the sub that shows the erotic sculptures on Hindu temples. Sexuality was considered spiritual back then, and I get the sense that the origins of Hinduism was strongly matriarchal. And the existence of the ""hijra"" community, while maligned now, shows that at least Hindu society recognized the ""third"" gender that we're only just beginning to embrace in the States.  I think we're just beginning to discover how much cultural and religious damage was wrought in the aftermath of those invasions."
ABCDesis,3cel4x,frackaracka,8,Tue Jul 7 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Well problem arises when you try to put Hinduism in to boxes, I mean there was not concept of religion till it came in contact with other religions, it was just how people used to live.  And how they practiced it differed according to caste as well, Till late 1800s lower caste women were not allowed to cover their breasts in Kerala, they had to protest this and gain the right to wear upper body cloths, There were a lot a demeaning and dehumanizing rituals as part of the religion, and reforms happened through out time. So what we consider now is an amalgamation of all these, same is true for most religions. Some reforms were progressive and some were regressive.  So If you visit Nepal to find untouched Hinduism you would be disappointed"
ABCDesis,3cel4x,frackaracka,0,Tue Jul 7 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying that Nepal's version of Hinduism would be completely untouched, just that it would be interesting to see the differences in practices.

That was really interesting to me because I'd never heard of such a practice before in modern India."

Have a story to share?"" to see some of the conversation here on undocumented community members. The Chicago South Asian Deferred Action Coalition won a 2015 Changemaker award at the South Asian Summit for their work doing DACA outreach in the community. If you haven't already, you may want to reach out to them. (I believe SAAPRI leads up that coalition.)"
ABCDesis,3ce4k9,anirvan,3,Tue Jul 7 15:25:18 2015 UTC,"I know a few undocumented Indians (mostly people elder to me), and from what I've noticed, I think there is somewhat of a stigma because that's not really something you're supposed to talk about, although stuff does sometimes end up spreading through gossip. From what I've noticed, while many people do talk about issues they might be having with their visas and whatnot, but many undocumented Indians would be reluctant to talk about their legal status outside of family. I don't think they've been treated that differently from the Indian community though, aside from maybe matters like marriage.  One undocumented woman I know is my cousin's maid, who is an elderly Indian lady. I don't remember the exact story of what happened, but it was something along the lines of some visa issues her sons when they brought her over to the US, and it somehow ended up in the lady being left behind here somehow. My cousin and her husband are pretty well off, so the maid sleeps in her own room in the house. She mostly helps out with cooking and cleaning and stuff like that. My cousin also brings her along sometimes to random family events such as weddings. A lot of us just refer to her as Baa (grandmother/somewhat old word for mother in Gujarati) and my aunts just call her Maa-ji, so she's treated respectfully by our family and our Desi community.  My cousin's cousin's family is also undocumented. My cousin's cousin's dad brought over his family to the US, and he came here on some student visa, and he ended up overstaying. His kids were brought up in the US, and the older kid is my age, college age. I don't know what exactly they did, but the older kid ended up going to a university in New Zealand, and I think that side of the family also ended up moving to New Zealand too.   Lot of details are missing, mostly because I don't think the parents want the younger kids to know too much about what's going on."

Now, latinos have hit a critical mass in terms of voting population and this allows dreamers to take risks that minorities like desis could never take.   Additionally, the consequences of your family being deported to Mexico (or any central American country) is a lot less severe than being deported to S.Asia. From Central America, there is a chance that you can find a way to cross the US Border. From S.Asia - no such luck. If your family gets deported, that is it."

ABCDesis,3cbqal,survivein,17,Mon Jul 6 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"I cheer for athletes coming from developing countries in general (though sometimes it depends on the sport, e.g. much more support in place for cricket in India vs. other sports). I respect their perseverance despite the lack of support system and infrastructure, and know how difficult it is to be able to train at a high level there.   For example, ""India's fastest swimmer is juggling tehsildar duties, faces a money crunch and still trains twice a day"" : http://www.firstpost.com/sports/indias-fastest-swimmer-juggling-tehsildar-duties-faces-money-crunch-still-trains-twice-day-2325812.html  Saina Nehwal, who won a bronze medal for India at the 2012 Olympics (and has consistently been ranked top 5 in the world over the last year), hadn't received the cash prize from this even two years later: https://twitter.com/NSaina/status/492318017817042944  On a side note, some years back, I took note of Tintu Lukka, who was running some fast 800m times for her age (when she was ~20). She was extremely talented, but as I watched her races/followed her racing, I saw that while she was able to somewhat get away with her racing strategy at smaller races like the Asian games, she struggled to compete at the international level (World championships and Olympics). I know it's also very difficult to train as a runner in India because of lack of places to run as well as the fact that it's still seen as ""strange"" in most places (and the 800 m is more of an aerobic race, meaning you need to be getting in a lot of miles to succeed at a high level).  Later on, I was talking to a (non desi) friend of mine who was going to be attending some of the track and field events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. I had mentioned Tintu Lukka to this friend before, as I was very intrigued by someone so talented (and also frustrated by her racing strategy, etc.). When I realized that my friend would be in the stands for the 800m preliminary races, on the spur of the moment, I decided to make a sign supporting Lukka that my friend would be able to hold in the stands (my friend was a good sport about this all and liked the idea).  The day of the 800 m semi-finals at the 2012 Olympics came, and true to his word, my friend stood in the stands holding the sign and cheering on Lukka. From what he says, he was pretty much the only one there (outside of coaching staff and possibly family) supporting her and received some rather surprised yet appreciative looks from them.   Anyway, I try to take note of athletes like this and make it a point to mention them/support them because I like seeing people get the chance to pursue what they're passionate about. It would be cool to see people have the chance to pursue non-cricket, athletic opportunities (among other opportunities) in South Asia and hopefully down the road that becomes more possible."

ABCDesis,3c9gks,confusedpresomething,9,Mon Jul 6 14:37:47 2015 UTC,We all know what we're getting into when it comes to pursuing careers of any stripe. That doesn't justify systemic and entrenched discrimination.
ABCDesis,3c9gks,frackaracka,-4,Mon Jul 6 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the fashion industry is different. Its concerned with beauty which isn't about how competent you are (like other careers), its mainly about what you are born with, which you cannot change. Discrimination was there from the very beginning in the fashion industry as it is completely Eurocentric. Its embedded into the industry's roots.   I'm not saying its justified but it is what the institution was built upon from the ground up. If the author truly wants equal rights in the career she's in, then she should just move to India where the color of her skin would be accepted beyond simply being exotic.   I don't see what she's trying to accomplish by complaining about discrimination by being in an industry that was Eurocentric from the very beginning. I mean, what is she really expecting?"
ABCDesis,3c9gks,confusedpresomething,7,Mon Jul 6 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"I used to think that too, until I saw how models actually do their job. There is some skill involved, believe it or not.  Your entire argument is that we should accept the status quo because ""it is what it is"". By that logic, what were our parents even thinking, coming to this country as immigrants if the entire workforce was built on the idea of Anglosaxon superiority? Why even strive to break the glass or bamboo ceiling if you know that the coveted positions only go to white men? You should have known what you were getting into."
ABCDesis,3c9gks,frackaracka,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I see what your saying but this is an industry based on beauty, not competence, despite the minor skills involved.   Our parents strived to break the glass because they had education which led to competence. The industries they were trying to break into required competence which is something that can be developed and honed. Medicine and engineering were fields that required excellent technical skills which the previous generation was able to develop through good education and hard work.    Beauty on the other hand is very different. Its based on its beholder who is currently being influence by a eurocentric mass media. Beauty is also based on how you look and that's something you cannot change. Therefore, you're subject to the institution that you work for and if that very institution is based on Eurocentrism, then you're basically out of luck.   Until something changes the Eurocentrism thats pervading this entire fashion/beauty industry, there will never be the type of equality the author is looking for.   Also, you mentioned how there was the idea of Anglosaxon superiority in the entire workforce when our parents came here. I think that type of discrimination is a more overt form of the discrimination that the author is experiencing in the article. The discrimination our parents faced was blunt and ignorant directed towards all POC just because we were different. When people soon began realizing the competence our parents' generation had, it started falling apart because we were equals in the workforce - we were equal technically with our skill sets.  The discrimination the author is facing is much more deeper, and its based on something we cannot change. So much so that even we desis are guilty of it. All the face-whitening creams that notable B-wood stars have endorsed as well as the fact that fair-skinned B-wood stars are the ones that thrive are all indicators of this.   Is the author really trying to look for equality in a western fashion industry when we desis also follow this eurocentric theme? Look around, its everywhere. Its not something that can be simply broken into like the technical fields of our parents. Its a completely different beast."
ABCDesis,3c9gks,confusedpresomething,7,Mon Jul 6 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"The point is, we shouldn't accept Eurocentrism as the default in these industries, nor should it be the most celebrated.  Did you read the article? This is what the author experienced.   A makeup artist once said to me (while doing my makeup) “wow, you’re super beautiful for a brown woman. I love doing make up on your skin. I haven’t gotten a chance to work with brown skin yet.” Of course, the dreadful “beautiful for a <insert race here> girl” that every WOC has heard in their lifetime. And to top it all off, I felt like a school project.   This is overt discrimination. Telling people they are beautiful despite their race is racist. It is not right to expect people to just put up with racism in their industries.   Is the author really trying to look for equality in a western fashion industry when we desis also follow this eurocentric theme?   Good question, but one that is better directed towards an article discussing the Desi fashion circuit.  Last point:   When people soon began realizing the competence our parents' generation had, it started falling apart because we were equals in the workforce - we were equal technically with our skill sets.   I would argue that this still doesn't happen. That's why I mentioned the ""bamboo ceiling"" - Asian workers don't get promoted to executive level positions despite working as hard or even harder than their white counterparts and being overrepresented at the ""worker bee"" level. Just because they knew what they were getting into doesn't mean that they should accept being unfairly compensated for the amount of work they contribute.  P.S. Not trying to be condescending or snarky, I think that this is a good dialogue. But it really does not compute to me that we should accept overt discrimination in any industry. That is literally condoning civil rights violations. I kind of don't know where else to go from there if you disagree with that."

ABCDesis,3c9gks,Dealwithis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:20:54 2015 UTC,"The point is, we shouldn't accept Eurocentrism as the default in these industries, nor should it be the most celebrated.    I agree with you. Its not something we should accept. But our accepting or not accepting doesn't change the fact that this is what the fashion industry is based on.   And I'm not saying that we should stop fighting and just give up because this is the standard now. An Indian American recently won the Ms. America pageant and I admire that. All I'm saying is that since the author knew this was the case going in, her entire article comes off as ""water is wet"" whining. She speaks of no effort on her part of fighting this discrimination.    I would argue that this still doesn't happen. That's why I mentioned the ""bamboo ceiling"" - Asian workers don't get promoted to executive level positions despite working as hard or even harder than their white counterparts and being overrepresented at the ""worker bee"" level.    I mean Satya Nadella is at the top of Microsoft and Indira Nooyi is at PepsiCo - both American companies. I think its a combination of being able to play politics as well as work hard, as well as being in the right place at the right time.   To sum up, I wasn't at all saying that we should, in any way, accept any form of discrimination in a field or the norms that field has. We should always fight it and strive to change it. But the reality is that eurocentrism exists and that's what the fashion industry is based on.   My problem is with the author acting as if she never knew this and it suddenly hit her in the face because of which her article sounds whiny. She also puts forth no solution to change this neither does she write about any instance where she stopped to speak up against the discrimination. To me it just seemed like she did the very thing you're accusing me of condoning, accept it.  P.S - I didn't think you were condescending or snarky. I wasn't trying to be rude either. This was a good dialogue that forced me to check my arguments"
ABCDesis,3c9gks,confusedpresomething,-10,Mon Jul 6 21:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I think OP is having a mild delusion here. She is in an industry that primarily objectifies women and uses their sex appeal to move products. I have yet to see a model recruited for addressing world hunger or halting the spread of Ebola.  Given that she has involuntarily agreed to let someone ""use her body"", I don't see why she has to complain about the type of gig that is using her. If some filafel chain wants a belly dancing model to hawk their wares, surely, Katie Holmes won't cut it. Does that mean Middle Eastern corporations are racist? Anti-caucasianist? No. It's the market, stupid.   You get paid, as a model, to sell shit so that people can buy that shit, and that's how you get paid."

It's because I'm a foreigner in their country and I agree with that assessment. If they kept assuming I was from India after I made it clear from where I was visiting, that would bother me a little.    It does bother the fuck out of me when people in America assume I couldn't possibly be from America. Usually when I set people straight when I'm visiting another country, they accept it. Americans, especially white Americans, start playing 20 questions, because they want to put you in a box  even if your speech is definitely an American accent. They do this because they're racist. Yes, I said it.   This is something first gens tend not to understand and do not feel, since they did immigrate, so labeling them as a foreigner is accurate.   When we get greater representation in the media it will be a fact for people living overseas. When people in America accept that it's not just black and white people living here, we'll see it. The Chinese have had immigrants in significant numbers since the 1800s, and they are still portrayed and conceived as perpetual foreigners.

If I go by your girlfriend's school of thought, I'd have to label myself as Bangladeshi-Canadian-American. I've inculcated all of those cultures and they make me who I am. Being identified solely as an American though doesn't mean I have to give up being Bengali. It means that my identity, my loyalty, my fidelity is to the country that allows me to express all parts of my heritage.   My passport doesn't say Bangladeshi-Canadian-American. It says American. That is my national identity and my ethnicity is irrelevant to that. I have never felt ashamed of my heritage and have always been eager to help people understand what it's like to be Bengali. I've exposed countless people to that region's art, literature, music, food and history.   Those ""other"" Americans have never once considered me to be anything else but an American because they understand that once you're here, your ethnic make up adds to the fabric of this country and you can still hold onto that while identifying as an American.   It's only Desis that get their lungis in a bunch and start assuming I'm ashamed of my culture, or think I'm a race traitor because I put my national identity (one that gladly embraces my ethnic identity) before anything else."

ABCDesis,3c97fc,arjun10,6,Mon Jul 6 01:57:21 2015 UTC,I've been trying to follow this closely. Thanks for bringing it up - it's alarming how far this reaches into every facet of society and the lack of jurisprudence. It's a bit concerning when a case like this goes on for this long but I guess that's what happens when everyone's incentives are aligned to hide the truth.   I'd argue that both governments are to blame in this case since it's spanned for so long - seems like the most logical thing is to transfer this over to the central government and CBI or to a different state to investigate. I'm skeptical that will happen.  This whole case does bring up an interesting debate around the commercialization of education and the pressures that students face as they aim for limited opportunities and inexcusably join this system of cheating.  I have been struggling with trying to find objective information around this - a lot of the articles I've read have been quite biased in one way or the other.

ABCDesis,3c7b0a,anirvan,15,Sun Jul 5 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"This is more of a cultural thing and it varies from family to family.  Growing up in Saudi Arabia (I'm Canadian of Pakistani origin, parents are corporate mercenaries), if a gathering had more than 3 families in total (hosts included) then the other living room would be utilized for the other gender. If it was 3 families or less (3 aunties, 3 uncles) then we'd all sit in the same room, with the females in one nook and the uncles in another nook. Men would ask women polite small-talk questions about their parent's health, travel plans, children, etc. and no one would raise an eye. Same vice-versa.  Meanwhile Indian Muslim and Bengali parties regardless of size would never be segregated, and even if they were, there was always conversation flowing from both ends to one another.   Its just an example of how some interpret their faith and how some don't, that's all."
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,IzmailPirzada,3,Sun Jul 5 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is cultural, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't help support gender segrative behaviour."
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,TheSlothBreeder,6,Mon Jul 6 04:29:09 2015 UTC,Agreed. This strikes me as more cultural than anything. The initial description sounded like many Punjabi Sikh gatherings I've been to.
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,BONER_Q_EINSTEIN,8,Sun Jul 5 18:49:12 2015 UTC,I really don't think this is Muslim specific but more a South Asian thing in general.   My family is Hindu on one side and Christian on the other and I've witnessed this segregation happen with both. If it's a very small gathering it's much less likely to happen but similarly if it's a huge party it's also less likely to happen (or at least is not as obvious) - it seems to be those medium-ish gatherings mainly.   My non-desi husband has always found this rather strange.
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,teapot_doc,5,Sun Jul 5 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the article but, from the comments I got it was about gendered segregation. I know it's VERY prevalent in the Hindu Indian community. All Indian parties I go to (regardless of size) are ALWAYS segregated. No matter the age, aunties and uncles don't talk, male and female teens NEVER talk (you don't want your parents glare), even little boys and girls under 10 yrs don't talk with each other. It's kinda sad."
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,IndianAmericanteen,4,Sun Jul 5 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think it depends. As a South Indian Hindu, I don't remember experiencing much gender segregation at Indian parties.

ABCDesis,3c7b0a,Suqraat,12,Mon Jul 6 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience (also South Indian Hindu family) if the gathering was small (like 2-3 families) then there was no segregation. If it was a larger party, it tended to split naturally along aunty/uncle lines, with the aunties helping the host aunty prepare the dinner, and the uncles sitting in the living room talking about their jobs.   Anyone 20 and under was always sent down to to the basement with a plate of bajjis/samosas and told to ""watch the Lion King or something"" until we were called up for dinner, or someone was forced to put on an impromptu carnatic/hindustani/bharathnatyam concert or until dinner was ready. Anyone 20 and under was assumed to be a ""child"" and therefore be sexless.   EDIT: That was my description of the parties of my childhood. The current desi parties I go to with my desi peers is pretty much the same as every other party. We eat pizza, play poker, and get crunk, regardless of gender."

ABCDesis,3c7b0a,asdfioho,7,Mon Jul 6 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with Islam. Among Punjabis, most of the parties are segregated and it's a relic from rural parties as well. And I'm talking all about Sikhs, despite segregation not being part of our religion technically. It is mutual and out of choice, though. The men and women generally talk about different topics, and the men usually drink and eat meat for snacks while the women do not (although dinner is eaten together). In Punjabi culture, although drinking plays a large part, you never drink in front of a woman: which is why when Punjab has been in drug problems, women often are at the front lines fighting. Anyways, even the kids are segregated. Boys wrestle/watch horror films/play video games, girls do their own thing. It's whatever I guess. Generally the only time women and men would get together would be weddings, which is why weddings were seen as good times for guys to talk to girls (see: Punjabi song ""Das Ja"")  That said, not all Punjabi gatherings are like that. My Bhangra team all hangs out together. At times i appreciate that more, but we never make crude jokes or are able to do ""bro"" activities, so honestly I think a bit of both is necessary to satisfy me socially."
ABCDesis,3c7b0a,GotZah,7,Sun Jul 5 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I had to attribute a source to this phenomenon, I'd argue this is more of a cultural thing (especially as you enter Asia). The way she wrote that opening scene, it felt just like every other desi party, and those people have roots in Hinduism, not Islam. Old cultural practices that push for a power imbalance and required ""respect"" for the husband still prevail today.  Look at how desis, in general, are raised: we're pushed to hang out with our gender, especially during our younger years, for fear that we may get a little too close with someone of the opposite sex. Not to say that parties now segregate themselves because there's a fear of inappropriate interactions, but we've been conditioned to seek out the company of our own gender from a young age.  tl;dr: when I go to a party, I just wanna hang with my boys."

ABCDesis,3c7b0a,GWmyc2,8,Sun Jul 5 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Some in the community believe that Islam dictates gender segregation: funerals are segregated, women are discouraged from attending burials, the mosque is divided in rooms of men and women.   Followed by:    Another friend sneered at my decision to boycott. “You think you’re going to change our people by refusing to attend? They’re just going to backbite against you. Your principled stance is lost on them. Most of them are happy in their gendered world.”   I'm not a religious expert but isn't backbiting one of the gravest sins in Islam? It's sad that people would use the shield of religion to continue a sexist and segregationist practice and at the same time commit a cardinal sin because someone isn't willing to indulge this practice.  Anyway, the author hit this right on the head and I think most people from Muslim families on the sub have seen this in various iterations - mosques, funerals, weddings, even dinner parties are split along gender lines."

If they're rigid and enforced, that's extreme, but I think fundamentally many aunties and uncles relate to folks of a similar gender than otherwise. All the uncles I know are into IT or civil engineering and enjoy discussing their jobs, whereas the aunties seem to be more community engaged. Of course there are some realms of overlap, like films, politics, sports, etc, and I think there should be no taboo between some mixing but if it's what people prefer and doesn't come from a place of OMG COOTIES HARAM but rather comfort/volition, I don't see the big deal. And men and women are different imo. Islam embraces this. There only some things my brothers get and others where my sister's observances are more highly valued. Sometimes you want to be in such spaces to enable certain discussions and the privacy it entails. As long as it isn't imposed or comes from sexist places, I don't mind voluntary gendered segregation in some aspects of life."

ABCDesis,3c26vp,ComeAtMeBrosephine,26,Sat Jul 4 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"So I have two points to make on this article. One is big, one is little.   The little point I have to make is...I get it. I get the whole #selfiewithdaughter thing. I get what it's trying to accomplish. I don't know if it's as effective as it could be (I mean, if female infanticide is most common in lower-income, more rural places, what are the chances that a twitter campaign would make a difference?) but I see that it's trying to make daughters ""cool"" and ""valued"". Because the least you can do for a thing you value is NOT MURDER IT.   My big point is...this shows just how weird and cult-y the Modi supporters really can be. Now I'm not saying all Modi supporters are this way, but there definitely has been a trend to the unquestioning support of Modi. When Modi wore that suit with his own name in the pinstripes and people made fun of it (cause c'mon, it was funny) people got butthurt and attacked in the worst way the people making the jokes. In my own experience, when I posted an article contrasting Modi's non-existent relationship with his wife with Arvind Kejarwal's seemingly close relationship with his? I was horribly insulted by people who I thought were my friends.   What kind of a world is it, if you can't criticize/ridicule your own government? Pick on your own PM? This hero worship is all very 1984-esque (where it's Modi instead of The Party, and instead of nondescript wars, it's the threat of ""westernization""...the parallels are creepy) and deeply worrying to me to see from a country were democracy has always been the modus operandi, if with difficulty."

This is nothing new in the subcontinent. Nehru was worshipped, so was his daughter for a while. In Pakistan our politicians misdeeds are wiped in the name of loyal support. In Bangladesh, both Khaleda and Hasina begum have fervent, hotheaded fan-bases regardless of their actual governance.

(Don't get me started on this, it's Independence Day, I'm from two countries that won their Independence by kicking the British out)  2) Has he considered that maybe to the extent it's true it's because of how the larger society here treats Indian Americans? A mediocre white person gets more respect than  an-average-for-an-Indian-immigrant or ABCD here.   If you are actually average and Indian here you are in deep shit.   It's all mercenary. The immigration policy IS mercenary: you're basically not getting in this country unless you're a highly skilled worker or you have family here.  If you're an unskilled worker and have no family, you'll be waiting decades if you do it legally.  I can know more about my country than some white ignorant asshole, but LOL everyone thinks a dumbfuck couldn't pass a citizenship test   is more a citizen than I am because s/he's white. This holds regardless of my level of assimilation, upto, including and going past the Jindals/Haleys of the world. Further, there's a very specific history of Americans throttling immigration of people from the subcontinent, so if the community in America is maybe one or two generations deep, that would affect this:   but are loath to give back very much more than their labour. They favour community cliques and cultural ghettos, and regard ‘American culture’—which they caricature as a mixture of excessive liberty and too much choice—with grave suspicion. They are ‘drop in’ immigrants—like those drop-in cricket pitches so popular these days: situated on American soil, but not an organic part of it. And that is by Indian-American choice, not the result of anyone’s exclusion.   On average, Indian immigrants are far more integrated with their friend groups than the white people he claims they refuse to integrate with.   Cogratulations to Tunku, British/Indian/expat whatever. He has managed to piss me off more than Jindal/Haley ever did and he can fuck all the way off with his stupid shallow analysis."
ABCDesis,3c2c5o,RotiRoll,3,Sat Jul 4 18:07:28 2015 UTC,"I have a response and it follows as thus -   It's not just Indian-Americans who are an infuriating and thin-skinned bunch. All of us of the diaspora are. See? Of all the Indians in the world, American ones are the most understandable because we see your portrayal of them in pretty much everything. It is because of our runaway success we are so irritated at how we are portrayed. Either as limp wristed panty waists or nerds or geeks. We often are denied any achievements outside the academic because no one thinks us capable of ""sports"".   Let's take an example of what you expect us to give back that Bobby and Nikki have done. Listen to an Atheist. I have no love for Hinduism but it is who I am. What I came from. My moral code (like it or not) was influenced more by Dharma and my understanding off Hindu literature despite not believing in it. I for instance believe that we should understand how our actions affect others and how well meaning actions may have far reaching negative consequences if we do not realise what effect our actions really have.  That to many conservatives is a mercenary outlook. Then fine. It's what made me become a doctor and it's what made me refuse a salary to help out the poor around me. Mercenary is sometimes good no?   And what do you define as giving back? I think that means ""Why Won't You Vote Conservative"". It's simple. Indians are well educated. They know that a vote for people like Nikki and Bobby is like voting for an Uncle Tom. We don't see why our representation must be something palatable to White Conservatives. We know your system doesn't work and that you don't see the bulk of us as palatable. The Christian Right's in bed with Republicans and they make the predominantly Muslim and Hindu Indians very uncomfortable. Particularly laughable when you hold up Jindal and Nikki as examples of ""choice"". Or that the American Republicans have anything to do with liberty. Slapping a screaming eagle, waggling a flag and shooting a gun at some cans is not liberty, not when they are gutting healthcare, education, freedom of privacy and the access of healthcare for women.   Also? If Cricket isn't Native to America then neither is Baseball or American Football. Everyone's got to play Basketball or Lacrosse! Just pointing out that those ""Indians"" you bemoan are as ""native"" to America as those White People. The only difference is sufficient time. And I bet those ""Indians"" have done more integration than those white people.   Jindal's being pilloried because he pretends to be white. Hence my joke. Bobby Jindal is so White that he can only dance to House of Pain's Jump Around. He's rejected where he's come from and that is not something most of us are willing to do. I have a foot in two cultures and so I am something more than British and more than Indian. I can be the best of both. Straddling the line makes me see both sides for the good and the bad and do the best out of them. Jindal's simply rejected a history longer than Christianity that comes from being Indian to get more votes.   Lastly? Jindal's not just a ""economic conservative"" but a social one. And that offends a group of people who don't have the same social codes. Jindal is free to follow any religion he chooses. It's just that he's a dick about it and wishes to enshrine that religion into law."

ABCDesis,3bwigd,GWmyc2,3,Thu Jul 2 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"Great read. It always saddens me when I go to India and talk world history, that my cousins are so ignorant  about it all.   When I was  a kid I was having identity issues about being Indian. When I was growing up Indians were seen as weak and cowardly.   So in history we're learning about Gallopoli (which is so important to the Australian physce) and I remember seeing  the stats for Indian soldiers and thinking wtf, they had the most numbers. So slowly I started to read more and more and go backwards from history and trace my roots.   We have an amazing military history, I remember watching one BBC documentary on Indian soldiers in WW2 and the historian mentioned if it wasn't for the Indian soilders we wouldn't have one the Pacific war.  Which makes sense we pushed them out of Burma (japan's biggest military defeat) which allowed the allies to push up from PNG."
ABCDesis,3bwa7p,_eternalsunshine,15,Thu Jul 2 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"I have.  It has been a very painful process for me.  Pretty much, got disowned for being with a white guy and left.  trigger warning: abuse  Dad started verbally/mentally abusing me everyday when he found out.  I would be sitting in the living room and his screaming would begin - I was apparently a 'hooker' and 'slut' and I should kill myself for dishonoring the family.  He told me everyday to jump off a bridge - that all he'd have to deal with are the funeral costs.  He has always had an anger problem and I began experiencing paranoia/fear/anxiety from staying near him.  I was very scared for my safety and towards the end he started to punch/kick me when he realized that I wouldn't listen.  Mom's response?  'He's disciplining you because he doesn't know what else to do! Why don't you listen? You are causing all these problems!'  My family did not hold him accountable for his behaviour.  They stole my IDs to prevent me from 'leaving' and other personal belongings.  People who I thought I could count on, such as my mom, used her health as a means to guilt-trip me.    'How can you leave me?' she pleaded.  'How can you do this to me?  You are making me sick!'  It was me who was 'provoking' him by being so sinful.  If I'm being completely honest, I feel anger towards her now for not defending me against my father and blaming me for his abuse.  I'm told always that I failed as a daughter but I think a parent who sits by and let the abuse happen is an enabler.  I still miss my family but feel a lot more mentally healthy now.  I have had to leave everything in my old life behind.  Thankfully I have been able to contact my siblings who I love to death.  I guess what I feel now is as if I'm an outsider to the community.  As if I was shunned and it makes me feel less...Indian if that makes sense?  I feel as if I don't belong anymore and trying to understand why some Desi communities don't recognize abuse and sweep it under the rug?"

There have always been Tamil classes that are secular, meaning that the teachers were Muslims, Christians, or Hindus. Some even were atheist with names like Stalin - oh dear!   Anyways, Tamil language has been around since PRIOR to 200 BC. It's actually been around since 500 BC in written form.   One thing that I'm confused about is this: Was there a proto-Tamil-Kannada-Telegu-Tulu-Malayalam ever spoken, and if so, when?   What were they speaking in Kannada in 200 BC? proto Tamil-Kannada?"
ABCDesis,3bvzln,ChitownNomzy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"I believe there is a proto-Dravidian language (proto-languages are always reconstructed).   Also Tamil nationalism tends to be atheistic in nature IIRC, unlike general Indian nationalism."

ABCDesis,3bvzln,TaazaPlaza,0,Fri Jul 3 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"great point.   I understand the proto-Dravidian language, and its appropriation is very confusing and basically random.   Did you know that there was no Malayalam prior to around the 15th century or so? That language emerged from Tamil over a 5 century time frame. To this day, those two languages are quite similar.   So I never understood why we call that proto language as Tamil, as opposed to ""Pre-Malayalam"" or ""Proto-Tamil-Malayalam""."

Cannot talk about the political or financial incentive to learn Tamil, but I think you don't need a political or financial incentive to want to learn a language. Plenty of folks learn and sometimes major in Latin.   As for the cultural incentive to learn Tamil. It's one of the oldest languages in existence. There's records of Old Tamil (or Sangam Tamil) literature dating back to 200 BC, and the language that's in Sangam literature is still pretty similar to modern Tamil. So I'd say there's plenty of cultural incentive in wanting to learn a language that's been around for over 2200 years."

ABCDesis,3bt1oy,flamegrl13,14,Wed Jul 1 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"The original politics involved Hindus and Muslims in Bengal, but the majority of the violence (over 1,000,000 dead) occurred in Punjab. Sikhs and Muslims were actually the main players there (Hindus were somewhat secondary), so the answer to your question is going to be quite long. I've done a good bit of reading on the topic, and my great grandfather on my paternal side was also a Sikh from Lyallpur/Faisalabad that successfully migrated with his family to modern day Indian Punjab (although some of my extended family there were killed).  I'll give my perspective based on what I've read. It's a huge topic, so I'll distill it to some basic points. The demographics of Punjab were generally split as they are today--the eastern side was mostly Hindu and Sikh, and the West was pretty Muslim dominated. However, there were pretty significant populations of Muslims in the East, primarily in the Sirhind area and Malerkotla (which actually didn't suffer any partition violence and is still the only area where Punjabi Muslims have a significant population in the East today), and also some parts of Gurdaspur. There was also a very decent sprinkling of Hindus and Sikhs throughout Western Punjab. Predominantly, Hindus were urban and owned businesses, and Sikhs were rural landowners who had large land tracts often plowed by Muslim farmworkers. Some Sikhs got to that position in Ranjit Singh's time, others like my great grandfather had moved from their homes in Eastern Punjab to develop canals and land under the British in the West. Many Sikhs, including my great grandpop, had also served in the British military and were well trained in arms.   Theres the politics of the Partition of the subcontinent, and I'm not really going to get into that. All the three major religions in Punjab in general had been moving towards religious-nationalist parties (Akalis for Sikhs, Arya Samajist parties for Hindus, and Muslim League for Muslims). The Sikhs were originally given an option to stay with Pakistan. However, several incidents, such as a ban on jhatka meat (Sikhs don't eat Islamically-slaughtered halal), and general alienation from the Muslim majority who were galvanizing against Sikhs and Hindus (doesn't help that there were class disparities), made the Akali Sikh leadership uneasy with Pakistan despite promises from Jinnah, and despite promises from Muslim leaders like Sikandar Hayat Khan who wanted a secular Punjab. Some Sikhs wanted an independent Khalistan, but it was pretty much ridiculed by everyone because Sikhs made a tiny part of the population. In general, the British were anxious to meet Sikh demands because they were fiercely armed and well trained. It was decided to split the Punjab into East and West. At about this time, Muslim mobs in Rawalpindi slaughtered the rich Hindu and Sikh minority, setting off violence in the West. When Sikhs in the East got wind of this development, they set off with their arms (which had been ready because they had been somewhat anticipating such an event) and started en masse killing Muslims in the East. There was a general Sikh fear of the Muslims' raw numbers, and there was fear among Muslims of the Sikhs' arms and training, and both manifested themselves pretty strongly. What pushed the violence to the brim was the fact that Punjab was a pretty martial region--two of the British's favorite ""martial races"" were the Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims.   Hindus were pretty much a third party, escaping alongside Sikhs, killed by Muslims, but not really participating in the violence. This is because of the violence started in Western Punjab cities but engulfed the countryside by the end. The film/book Tamas states that proto-Hindu nationalists incited violence in some cities, I've just got to read more about it.   It's very sad on all accounts. The only reason our family survived was because great grandpa had an extra machine gun from WWII and deterred any would-be attackers. I know that in Sikh tradition, there is a culture of shaheedi, dying for a cause, and fighting for the oppressed and righteousness. Although you will find many Sikhs today who still harbor anti-Muslim sentiments because of the history, in general those who participated in Partition violence are not remembered in that vein at all and it is seen as a black day for Sikhs, in both what happened to us and what we did to innocents, and not glorified in any way."
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,asdfioho,5,Thu Jul 2 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"Don't want to get into castes, but I have a question.  Why were there so many Arora (Khatri) Sikhs from West Punjab?  My family was untouched by partition (except for my mums grand uncle who had land in West Punjab). All the villages around mine are Sikh (no Hindus either, which is unusual for Doaba). We know a family in my city who are Muslims who came from a pind next to mine.  Wish it didn't happen though. If only Punjabis could get along."

ABCDesis,3bt1oy,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps, but I'm from Southern Punjab in Pakistan. Pre-partition the demographics of my district was: 130K Muslim Jatt; 100K Shaikh Muslims (Khatri converts); 70K Baluch; 3000 Sikh; ~600 Hindus. Both the Sikh and Hindus were Khatri Aroras. However, it is believed they are self-designated, as most native people of NW India were never assigned castes -- Hindu, Buddhist, or otherwise. The Aroras in West Punjab were mainly money-lenders; as Muslims generally did not seek banking professions due to the prohibition on usury. This was true of the Hindus of my district. The Sikhs of my district settled during Ranjit Singh's rule and were in the lucrative business of rope-making from hemp.    Generally speaking, almost all Punjabi Muslims who own land are either Jatt, or 12th century Khatri (Rajput, Gujar...etc) converts. The majority of West Punjab are Dalit, uncasted, or foreign converts.   Pre-Islam, most of what is now Pakistan fell into: uncasted Hindus (clanned Sindhis), casted Khatris (ruling class of Indus Valley/Taxilla/Peshawar/Kabul), or out of the fold of Vedic culture altogether (Jatts). The Jatts were pastoral nomads who moved north out of their native Sindh following the Arab invasion and were the first to farm Punjab; hence the ""farmer"" association. They assimilated languages and religions of the areas they settled by the 13th century. Those that adapted Hinduism were considered Dalit in the 8th century, Shudra/Vaysha in the 11th, and protested heavily for Kashtirya and Zamindari status in the 17th century. They were aggressively opposed by the Rajputs, and thus, a large amount of Jatts gravitated towards Sikhism -- as it offered social status that the Brahmanic tradition wasn't willing to offer.   So, it is plausible that most Sikhs from Western Punjab are self-designated Khatris because that is what they believed they were -- and indeed fought for -- in social standing prior to Sikhism. And with the ascendancy of Ranjit Singh, society all but accepted it.  Just my 2 cents."
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,khanabadoshi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time for writing such an excellent post. One follow up question: in what ways do you see/feel the repercussions of the Partition on your family besides the anti-Muslim sentiment? Do you see it when you visit India? Also, what reading recommendations do you have that discuss the Partition?"
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,alwaysLearning1984,2,Fri Jul 3 23:16:06 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, not really. I mean, our village was formerly Muslim, so it has a Muslim name, but that's pretty much it. The former mosque was used as a Gurdwara for some time but we built our own Gurdwara after we got more resources. The mosque still stands, even if it's vacant.  There are still Muslims in Malerkotla and there are immigrant Muslims working in Punjab, but they're not treated worse or anything, people just don't really care. My dads social village dynamics were unique though. Most villages are composed of relatives, but since this was one of Partition refugees, nobody was related. This made the village not very friendly like typical rural settings and more disjointed. Women had to cover their head when going out, you wouldn't go out after dark, you couldn't even do a Jaago before a wedding and everything was very low key. My mom came from a native village, and the environment was very different in that regard. My moms village also was not very generous to the refugees when they came, so people from my dads village had to go in the night to steal crucial supplies that they needed for living. This set off a competition between the two villages in a sense for better facilities and such. The biggest legacy, though, is that however you look at it, Punjab is split East and West between India and Pakistan.   As for books, I can give some of my specific recommendations in a bit (on mobile now), but I remember learning a lot just by going to my local library and reading proper books there on Partition. There is a ton of misinformation going around because people don't do their basic reading. For example, many Sikhs I know think that Gandhi is the one that split Punjab, something that's absolute BS."
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,asdfioho,2,Sat Jul 4 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I recently saw Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram, and it really got me interested in the Partition and its legacy on modern India. It is very interesting to trace the history and here first hand testimony. Case in point: polling my family on NaMo, and you can find clear divide from generation to generation. Anyways, my own family wasn't affect at all by the Partition, but I have some friends who are from Punjab and Bengal, and their views on lots of things are very different from mine/my family's."
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,alwaysLearning1984,5,Sun Jul 5 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"I watched a documentary about it. While there were no formal agreements, it seems like Sikh and Hindus were generally treated the same by muslims, thus they never attacked each other. One Sikh village was surrounded by Muslims and told they had to give up a virgin daughter. To save their dignity or whatever the village leader, or whoever he was, beheaded all unmarried girls. Bear in mind this is the guys son that is telling this story and breaks down when he gets to the part about his own father cutting off his sisters head. Horrible stories about Muslims surrounding other Sikh villages and taking women away to be raped or simply slaughtering whole villages.   Sikh villages were in no way lilly white. One of the guys they interviewed said they went around just killing muslims. Didn't matter if they were fighting or not. While they didn't have specific stories like the one I mentioned above, they had plenty of stories about both Sikh and Hindus raping and killing. Sikh parties would go village to village and gather men up to go out and literally just kill Muslims.   I'm sure others will chime in and mention specific horrors their families suffered, but I would like to remind people that both sides committed genocidal acts. No one side was better than the other."
ABCDesis,3bt1oy,hahaheehaha,11,Thu Jul 2 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen the documentary in question. Very sad. Punjabi women were the ultimate losers in Partition (Khamosh Pani is a great film on the subject). To preserve their ""dignity,"" from the other side women were told to commit suicide. If they didn't and weren't killed after being raped, they would convert to the other religion and marry someone of that faith who took them in. Those women would be questioned and alienated for their whole life. By adherents of their old faith, they would be seen as traitors and dirty for having sex with someone of the new faith. For their new co-religionists, their conversion would be seen as questionable and their sincerity doubted. Terrible situation.   BTW. Quick disclaimer, while its definitely a reality that many Sikh women were forced to commit suicide to save themselves, it's not a view perpetuated by Sikhism, which advocates women also receive arm training, keep a sword (kirpan), and defend themselves.  EDIT: oh, I just remembered another ordeal many women had to face in Punjab. Men's caste is generally not questioned because they have their caste name, but women take their husbands' caste name. My dad's paternal grandmother was very beautiful and attracted a lot of jealousy. Her only family members were brothers who were killed in Pakistan, so she technically had nobody to advocate that she was Jatt. Rumors spread that she was secretly from the goldsmith caste (forgot what it's called), and everyone in the village seriously made her life hell (doesn't help that villages formed by Partition refugees aren't related by family like others and thus are not very close-knit). It's a society where caste shouldn't exist in the first place, but Partition gave the social reality of caste another venue to ruin people's lives."

ABCDesis,3bt1oy,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"In the Urban areas it was Hindu vs. Muslim. In the Rural areas (the majority) it was Sikh vs. Muslim. Violence occurred mainly in towns with ~50/50 splits, the majority located around the border region. A lot of violence occurred pre-partition in anticipation of partition -- the logic of both sides being, ""if we kill more of them than they kill of us, we will be the majority"". Having a slight majority, by as little as 50 people was enough to be designated in one country or another. So the stakes were real.  Much of the violence was precipitated by the British Crown expediting partition by 6 months. If I remember correctly, the entire affair -- from announcement of independence/partition until partition itself -- was in the span of 4-5 months. This do not give either side time to prepare at all; it wasn't even revealed what the border would be until the last weeks. Perhaps the worst decision was delaying the fate of Lahore. The decision of which country Lahore would cede to was announced a few days before partition. Clearly, everyone in/near/around Lahore was waiting to know what to do. Nerves on extreme edge, all-consuming fear, rage and anger, and utter confusion and unpreparedness were obvious outcomes of this decision. The people of one of the largest cities in South Asia didn't know if they had to move East/West or stay until a week before the border.  Most deadliest places of attack were at train stations. As trains would stop on their way to the borders, they would be attacked and lit on fire or boarded and killed by sword. Very few people on either side don't have a relative that was not affected/traumatized/killed in one of these attacks. Both my uncle and aunt survived a train that was set alight coming from Gurdaspur. They were 19 and 17 y/o; neither of them matured mentally or spoke ever again until their deaths 60 years later. My aunt just smiled and would wash the same clothes over and over again everyday. My uncle would sit on a stool, leaning against the wall with 4 packs of cigarettes in his left hand, smoking 3 puffs of a cigarette, putting it out, and then move on to the next cigarette. Like clockwork, from the moment he woke until the moment slept, every day.   Interestingly, in Sindh there was little to no violence, despite many Hindu districts being awarded to Pakistan. Very few people in Sindh, Gujurat, or Rajasthan migrated, despite religion."

ABCDesis,3btdgo,Happy-feets,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"The irony is that if Bobby Jindal had displayed the same purported extremism or trenchant commitment to his faith as a Hindu rather than as Christian, he would likely have been embraced warmly by the very communities that now label him a turncoat. If Jindal had insisted on the primacy of Vedic Civilization instead of creationism, or if he had disagreed with the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage in the name of Hinduism rather than Christianity, the vitriol against him would have been significantly more tempered.   This is where I strongly disagree. The root of the backlash isn't because of his policies. Most people don't care about his policies, he has a very slim chance of winning anyway.  It's because he's representing a minority community (whether he likes it or not) and has chosen to cut all ties with it.     It could be Bobby Jindal, or it could be an ordinary person - I would have the same reaction to the person forgetting their roots. The reason this has gotten such exposure is because Jindal is in a national spotlight.  I don't understand what it means to not identify with a culture. If you don't agree with your religion, that's one thing. But when it comes to things like changing your name, that has nothing to do with personal identification and begins to transcend the bounds of being whitewashed.   In my opinion, the two things that truly constitute cultural identity are name and language. Food and clothing are material/superficial and people have different preferences and tastes. Religion is complex concept in itself and has so much room for interpretation and judgement.   But when you change your name (not saying Jindal did, just in general) or forget your mothertongue, that's when you lose your identity. That's when you lose what makes you unique from others. You can't say you ""identify"" with another language - you either don't put in an position of importance or you are ashamed of it. When it comes to name, to me, changing it purely means you aren't connected with your culture. I don't see a single valid reason to change it.  If you make the argument that it's because it hard for others to pronounce, that's their problem, not yours. If you make the argument that it's to assimilate, that's invalid as well. That's not what assimilation is. Plus, the US is a country founded by immigrants for immigrants, so I don't even see what you're assimilating into."
ABCDesis,3btdgo,_QED,5,Thu Jul 2 08:23:00 2015 UTC,"Food and clothing are material/superficial and people have different preferences and tastes.    You have the strangest view of what makes identity. Food is an integral part to culture that is not a ""superficial"" choice. Understanding food is understanding the evolution of an entire culture. Most of travel channel's business (and food tv in general) revolves around this idea.    If you make the argument that it's because it hard for others to pronounce, that's their problem, not yours.    No it's not if you're a minority in the country in question. My dad had to lead to a lot of unnecessary bullshit due to his name ranging from ""trivial"" things like mail problems to issues at work. I mean look at the recent studies where people send out the same resume and simply change the name from Joe to Jose. Your name radically changes the world you have to deal with and it's exclusively your problem. No one else gives a shit about how their racial biases affect you. (Note: I'm not advocating anyone should change their name, just noting there's an opportunity cost to accept)  Changing his name or not knowing Punjabi does not make Jindal less of an Indian. Even his own removal from his heritage does not make him not Indian. It's his adamant belief that being different is wrong, that he is ""tan"" instead of brown, that ALL Indians (at least in America) should all give up whatever ties we have to our culture and do exactly as he did that is the problem."

Delivery pizzas drown their products in cheese because they think fat/salt can overshadow the fact that they are using shitty ingredients and have shitty technique. I think the best way to make pizza is to make it yourself- If you know how to make a good crust, the rest is easy because the only trick lies in using high quality ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, good olive oil, etc.) If you can't/won't make your own pizza, your next best bet is to find a pizzeria that is certified in making Naples-style pizza."

ABCDesis,3bqnui,GWmyc2,2,Wed Jul 1 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was here during the riots. Fled work early to make sure I didn't get caught up in any of it.  I think it was mostly idiots making the trouble (lot of the protests were peaceful!), but the police sort of had to give up because what could they possibly do? Respond to a protest about police violence with more police violence? So they sat around and watched the city burn until the national guard showed up, at which point the violent protestors knew the game was up.  Baltimore is an interesting patchwork. Some neighborhoods are quite safe and even family friendly, while others are quite the opposite, but what's strange is that sometimes there's less than a block space between them. Baltimore proper is surprisingly small. Even in the safe areas, though, I wouldn't go wandering around late at night. There doesn't seem to be a lot to do after 10 pm anyway except make trouble.  In general, I think police in this city do an okay job in the white/rich parts of town, but clearly they're not doing such a good job everywhere else (as evidenced by the protests).  I've only been here for 2-3 years, though, and I sort of live in the ""student bubble"" so my experience probably doesn't speak much about what Baltimore is really like."

I've heard the biggest losers in that regard were actually Asian business owners who neither got police protection, nor leniency from looters as their shops weren't ""black-owned businesses"". However, I don't know the exact stats on property damage during the riots.  I don't doubt your couchsurfer's story. Americans can be as racist as they can be tolerant.  The US highway system really should be considered one of the Wonders of the World, especially the scenic routes like Highway 5 on the west coast. I highly recommend it!"

ABCDesis,3bprvp,LotusEyes92,2,Wed Jul 1 04:15:58 2015 UTC,Sigh...always an afterthought. JK! I agree with u/ShereOnFire. It's definitely not like America where most people seem to be quite rich. It's definitely not the case where every other person I know is a doctor. I don't know anyone who is a doctor (of my parents' generation). There is a lot of variation mostly depending on how many generations people have lived here for and the age at which people immigrated.The ones who moved here when they were young and single tend to be quite well off. South Asian immigration to NZ started a lot later than immigration to the USA so the struggles are typical to that of first gen immigrants in the US. My parents were well qualified in India but that wasn't accepted here so they had to find other jobs that are borderline blue/white collar. That seems to be a fairly typical story among people we know. I live in a place where there are a lot of Indians. And it's not a poor place exactly but it's nowhere close to being posh. A lot of people of my generation seem to be doing really well and a huge number of them are doctors/engineers/analysts etc and so I can see the following generation in the future being in the same place that South Asians in the US are in now. We're just a step back.

ABCDesis,3bprvp,feetintheair12,10,Fri Jul 3 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"Yooo Indian Aussie here.  Indians here are middle class, it varies from upper to middle middle and to lower middle class.   So I'll break it down further. Majority of South Asians came here in the mid 80s to mid 90s. Many of these South Asians were  part of the first wave of brownies to enter the country. Now their skills varied from skilled like my dad to unskilled like some family friends we know.   My parents like many desis and other ethnic groups settled in the west of Sydney. Sometimes  the west is known as the ghetto as especially the south west. But it's a lot more complicated than that, it's not like America.   So economically were a mix, you'll meet desis who are quite well of and their parents buy them cars and all that stuff. Then you'll meet desis who are legitimately struggling. The job market here is so competitive and especially for medical trained professionals, you have to study and pass exams again. It's considered harder then most other countries.   For example my dad is a vet but he couldn't practice here because he had to restudy and pass three exams. Unfortunately for him I was born. But he got a nice government job which is a mix of blue and white collar.   However in the last 10 years we had the second generation of South Asians migrating in particularly Indians.  These Indians are actually doing better then my parents generation  who migrated here, but they have their own issues.   Keep in mind the desi community is here is much smaller then compared to you guys from the northern conteints ."

And with unusual I mean awesome. Their attitudes were amazingly laid-back - which is all the more striking since I believe we're a tightly wound people in general. And I found them very friendly as well, and they seemed very happy and content in Australia.   The thing is, because of somewhat similar colonial histories I expected Indian Aussies to resemble Indian Americans, but they couldn't be more different."

ABCDesis,3bpb4h,HeadlineGlimmer,8,Wed Jul 1 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"I believe the term's used to describe those who lived in 2+ countries or constantly moved around from place to place their whole lives, which is why third culture kids don't necessarily have a place they call/consider home. With ABCDs I feel like it's more of a cultural clash."
ABCDesis,3bpb4h,RotiRoll,5,Wed Jul 1 06:31:21 2015 UTC,"The crux of being a TCK(third culture kid) is that you spend a significant part of your formative years (before 18) in a culture outside of your parents so you form your identity in multiple cultures.  ABCDs are children of  South Asian immigrants born and/or raised here.  Now both ABCDs and TCKs are cross cultural kids or (CCK)[http://tckid.com/crossculturalkid.html], so a lot of same dilemmas people on this sub face, TCKs face on steroids.   We're children of immigrants and we're children of ethnic minorities in the United States and Canada, so many of us are CCKs in at least two ways.   ABCDs can be TCKs though: My uncle was born to his parents who had already immigrated and he stayed with my grandparents in India until he was ten, then he and his mother and brother moved back to states. My aunt and uncle immigrated from India to the UK and then to the US. As a result their oldest kid spent the first few years of his life with my grandparents, came to the UK when he was five and then immigrated with the family when they went to the US. His younger brother was born in the UK. They usually call people like that 1.x-ers but YMMV.   For example I have a friend who is ABCD married to a white american. They are now living in Germany for a couple of years. If they have a child in Germany, and then move again to another country or back to the states when the kid can remember, that child will be a TCK.   I think there's also class connotations with TCKs because not all immigrants have highly educated parents with relative ease of movement between nations."

ABCDesis,3bl3ra,KaliYugaz,2,Tue Jun 30 08:33:25 2015 UTC,"I'm more interested in why we must have an ""identity"" at all. Is it really a universal human need, or is it just a result of how Western culture and intellectual frameworks have taught us to relate to the world?  For instance, in Indian and East Asian philosophies, the central insight is often that we aren't independent agents at all, and that is just an illusion."
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,serenissima_regina,2,Tue Jun 30 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"I feel personally that identity exists on different levels such as a personal identity or a cultural identity. Different populations not only differ in their respective identify but also in how much emphasis they put on each type. So people like us find it challenging, I guess, in not only figuring out our identity but also how much emphasis to put on each type."
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,KaliYugaz,3,Tue Jun 30 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"the central insight is often that we aren't independent agents at all, and that is just an illusion   But the flip side is that a system like that is also very opposed to self-determination. Your job, lifestyle, and spouse are all picked out for you. It's a major offense if you do anything against the wishes of elders or outside of social norms.  ""It's an illusion,"" sounds great ... until it becomes:  ""It's all an illusion, so why get hung up on your girlfriend, come marry virgin bride from good family.""  ""It's all an illusion, so why worry about your profession? Do pre-med and become a doctor.""  ""It's all an illusion, so why shame us by being gay? Get it together and marry a nice girl."""
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,RotiRoll,2,Tue Jun 30 19:23:32 2015 UTC,"But the flip side is that a system like that is also very opposed to self-determination.   Exactly, and I'm saying that the only reason it occurs to you to have such a thought in the first place is because you're sitting on thousands of years of Western intellectual tradition.   The idea of self-determination as something that is valuable in its own right comes out of Existentialism, which is rooted in the ethics and ideals of Enlightenment liberalism, a movement that basically kicked the supernatural stuff out of an intellectual framework set up by Protestantism and its focus on individual responsibility for ones salvation, which of course only makes sense within the framework of Christian doctrine, which emphasizes free will as a solution to some of its central theological problems.  I'm not entirely sure it would even occur to someone in Ancient India or China, who was acculturated into a completely different intellectual milleu, to want self-determination or ""identity"" or ""authenticity"" at all, or believe that such things even make rational sense."
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,fameistheproduct,10,Tue Jun 30 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"You sound like a classic TCK.  You're from several places at once, it's ok. I pick and choose a place based on my audience and how deep of a conversation I want to get into.  It's not something people who immigrate as adults or people who never immigrate even understand and it's not something I lay on people in casual conversation.   You will have the most in common with people who immigrated as kids and remember it or people who have immigrated twice. One of my mother's cousins' and one of my cousins have a similar biography.  Another possibility are classic army brats.    I have only a basic grasp of my mother tongue, I've pretty much lost my American accent, I hate Indian serials with passion, I can't wear skimpy clothes without feeling hussy-like, I feel like an American when I'm in India, and feel like an Indian when I'm in the US. I pretty much I don't have an identity or relate to any culture when in fact I should be part of two.   This is what happens to me during summer vacations I took as a child. It's normal.

ABCDesis,3bl3ra,TaazaPlaza,4,Tue Jun 30 09:29:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, I hope I'm not late, OP! Thought I was the only one.  I was born in India (TN) and when I was like two, my family moved to the US (OH). I spent the next 6 or so years there and then we promptly moved to Chennai and I've lived here ever since. (I'm 22) And I heartily agree - Fuck CBSE. <Sadly I didn't get naturalized :'(>  I can speak both Indian and American English 'natively' and am not comfortable in any Indian language. I had a lot of issues with this growing up in India, I had to overcompensate to blend in when it came to certain things. It didn't help that my parents had a sort of culture shock coming back to a heavily globalized India and the whole Anglophone Chennai middle class. I had to find my own space which took years.  It felt weird because everything everyone I knew watched, listened was so full of masala. Bollywood, Kollywood and their music industries. I wanted something more individualistic and something that spoke to me.  I found it through anime, internet humor, books and rock music. These things started giving me loads of confidence from around the time I was in 7th and they helped me through some really tough times and identity crises. More importantly, I began meeting more people like me, who, in their cases had lived their whole lives in India, rejected the things I did and identified with what I did. That was an amazing thing.  I wasn't fully comfortable till the time I began college. (Identified as more 'American' when I was much younger, because I didn't understand how things worked here yet - Jesus, that feels like another life itself.)  Thankfully as I've said, the internet and liberalization here has brought about and strengthened a new and budding (mostly Anglophone middle class) individualistic culture where these things are not as relevant. I've found my space in this culture and pretty much associate with people of this kind, whom I've met via school, music or mutual friends. I had a phase where I read heavily on Indian history, culture, language, etc and read translated Indian literature and lots of Indian English longform journalism on cultural and social matters which contributed significantly to gaining a strong understanding of the land I lived in, the land of my ancestors and where I stood vis a vis the general society. Gave me a strong perspective on identity which helped quell many nagging questions.  I didn't have the entire 'American experience' and can't relate to ABCDs, and my 'Indian experience' feels defective as well. Sometimes I wonder why I participate in this sub, because I don't have a proper 'diaspora' experience and don't identify as being a part of it.  I've not been to the US or even the West in general for almost 15 years, Christ, I don't know how I'd react. Though as time passes it seems more necessary that I migrate, I'm getting really tired of dealing with the low standards of life here and the societal, political mindfucks, work culture, etc etc."

ABCDesis,3bl3ra,TaazaPlaza,2,Tue Jun 30 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I can speak it with a thick accent because growing up friends at school and in the neighborhood spoke English most of the time. Also it's not my mother tongue. And no, it didn't change much except making traveling easier, the differences aren't just language choice but the pop culture/values the society holds. I don't feel Indian languages have 'social space' for much individualism. Movies, music, etc are produced for masses and don't have too much variation and you're expected to be so and so. Ex - A true Punjabi does this, a true Tamilian doesn't do this, a true Malayali likes this, etc etc."
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,big_curry,3,Tue Jun 30 17:37:10 2015 UTC,hmm I was wondering if learning the language enabled you to better understand what's going on around you and what the people around you are thinking.

You're at a perfect age to start asking yourself these questions and going out and seeking answers to them. I think as first generation South Asians most people face identity issues in some way. I think it is important to understand what you want to learn and find like minded people that might feel the same way. I think you would be surprised in what you can learn by visiting various South Asian networking events or even visiting college campuses where they have South Asian groups. As my history teacher once told me, you may never find the answers and will always go up and down, but it is important to keep questioning yourself."

ABCDesis,3bl3ra,book-of-kells,3,Tue Jun 30 04:21:34 2015 UTC,"On another track the experience of Indian immigrants, whether 1st or 2nd gen, is overwhelmingly (sub)urban. I, on the other hand, was raised near the countryside in Europe. Horses and wildflowers on a breeze. I didn't grow up with that many people around me, especially not people who looked like me. I feel most comfortable when I have plenty of space around me and I like being surrounded by farm animals and woodland creatures. I've had some Indian guys from India treat me like an unsophisticated hick because of that (they were more upper class though and had lived in places such as New York - I got the whole ""the countryside is soooo boring I don't know  how you can stand it there"" and ""oh my god you've never been to New York???"" treatment. Also, negative BharatMatrimony/Shaadi.com experiences, how can you tell?).   My point is that there is always some way in which we are 'different' from the mainstream. In my country the majority of desis are Surinamese whose great-great-grandparents migrated in the 19th century from Bihar, meanwhile I was born in India. The vast majority of the vocal Indian diaspora consists of North Americans and has English as a first language, I am from Europe and English is only my second language. And there many ways that other people are different, e.g. they are from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka instead of India.   Embrace whatever makes you unique, you will have different experiences and an interesting story to tell."
ABCDesis,3bl3ra,pomegranita,3,Tue Jun 30 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, you've come to the right place. First of all, identity issues can plague anyone and they are usually more intense when you're younger. So if you're feeling hopelessly confused, rest assured that in time it will all work itself out :)  But more specifically, based on my own identity issues, I feel that these issues can be stronger for  those of us that don't have a static group of people around us that can reinforce our image of ourselves. That is, if you move around a lot, and especially through your formative years, you don't have anyone around you that confirms your identity. Based on fundamental differences, for a prolonged period in your life, you have viewed yourself as different, and at best, your peers have confirmed that you are different. This is confusing because you're the last person to see yourself from the outside, and may not agree with everyone's characterization of you as different. And when you delve deeper and begin to question this, you find that you are, in fact, fundamentally different due to your experiences in two different cultures. That makes things even more confusing.  I personally feel that your level of confusion is greater than the average ABCD. The fact that there exists an ""average"" ABCD, reinforces the idea of being an ABCD. I am generalizing and people will disagree with me and I admit that ABCD is a vast spectrum, but I hope you understand what I mean. If you wanted, you could define the ""typical"" ABCD based on some metric and poll a large group of South Asian Americans, and you would find that the largest number of people fall close to the metric you defined (if your metric is good enough). You would still fall outside that metric.  The good thing is that judging by the rise in the number of this type of posts here on /r/abcdesis, there seems to be an emerging awareness among people like you (and me). That is, I find that you feel ""different"" in very similar ways to how I (and many others on this sub) feel different, and we feel additionally that we are also different from the average ABCD. (I hope no one takes ""different"" to mean bad here). But this is a new phenomena, and I think each of us that falls in this category will at first find each other to be very different too. What would be interesting would be to see the establishment of these new deviant sub-identities, and I think it is very possible through the increase in awareness through places like this sub.  In all, even though it's kind of a confusing time for you right now, it's actually a kind of fun journey. You'll learn a lot about yourself. Try to embrace both of your seemingly contradictory identities and don't let the ideals of one identity keep you from embracing the other. Be American. Be Indian. Be something in between. Eventually, you will find your own identity and won't have a problem with being any of these!"

But like /u/VictorShakapopulis said, I have found that people think it's really interesting when you have a ~complex~ background, and I have just learned to take pride in it. Nowadays I know a few other people who have similar stories (I have two Iranian friends who were born and raised in Armenia and only speak Armenian but feel Iranian/Persian for example).  When I know it's not likely I will speak to someone again, I will just go with whatever they think I am (so if they think I'm Indian, I'll just say yes instead of doing the entire backstory) and when I know someone is confused or interested and has the time, I will explain.    I think you should just focus on the stuff you like, regardless of your cultural identity and connect with people over that. I also believe in the cliché that the older you get/the more confidence you get, the more you will know who you are :)"

I have noticed a lot of people in the Netherlands being quite clueless about Surinamese people/the Indo-Surinamese community (the idea that roti is creole is incredibly prevalent, people know about slavery but nothing about other migration streams and indentured laborers) due to the Dutch school system failing with regard to this. Most Dutch people also think I'm Indonesian so they are kinda surprised when I explain this backstory.  Anyway, the point is that I have encountered in my life that people think of my background as ""complex"" and I have had to explain to 75% of Dutch people why I look Indonesian or Indian when I am in fact from Suriname. Even if my identity would be considered mainstream, that doesn't make my background and being Indian/desi, Caribbean and European at the same time less complex."

Back when I was interning at a company, maybe five years ago, I was sitting down with a coworker discussing something. She said ""you know, I'm really glad about how nice and friendly you are to work with, I was worried at first.""  Naturally... I asked ""why were you worried?""  ""Oh... About a year ago, we had another Indian man intern in our department and he was a nightmare. He was rude and didn't want to take orders from women working here. When I first saw you, I was worried you were going to be the same way. Glad you're not though!""    I was an intern - so getting indignant wasn't an option, but I was dumb struck. If that other dude and I were both white, it would've been written off as it should've. That the other dude was just a shitty person. Instead, he became an ambassador for brownness at this workplace."
ABCDesis,3bia7k,kinsho,20,Mon Jun 29 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"Excellent article. Ironically, it kind of pissed me off at the end where it concluded that rage is a white privilege.  /u/BONER_Q_EINSTEIN gave a perfect example of what I myself have only recently discovered (yeah, call me slow if you want)...unlike white people, each one of us represents our race in the eyes of folks not like us. It's an unfair burden. A mess-up on our part doesn't just effect us...it effects the perception of our whole kind.  One of my former co-workers went out with an Sri-Lankan guy that she later found out was a huge pervert. She ended the relationship pretty quickly, but the whole experience left her embittered against South Asian men in general. I told her that her belief was fucking stupid, and she agreed....but she still couldn't shake her bias.  Years ago, I was helping out a Gujarati priest clean up the mandir after a wedding. When I escorted him out to his car, I saw him hold the door open for a whole group of white people leaving the hotel. He admitted to me he didn't do that entirely out of the kindness in his heart - he did that in part to leave them with a better impression of desi folk in general. My young ass thought he was out of his mind at the time, that we would be judged fairly by everybody else as individuals and not necessarily by the actions of other members of our race.  Nope."

ABCDesis,3biq1o,ShereOnFire,14,Wed Jul 1 23:14:23 2015 UTC,I think the film maker is right - Indians audiences don't want to see movies about poor people.   I found this Time magazine article that covered Slumdog Millionaire's opening weekend in India. Quite a few people didn't really care much about the movie because it reflected reality too much for their liking. A lot of people in India go to watch movies just to escape into a better world for a little while.
ABCDesis,3biq1o,kinsho,6,Mon Jun 29 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it was more that the movie was overhyped outside India or considered some 'representative film' and that just because it was about India people here should react. Most people I know saw it, went meh and proceeded to watch a Bollywood or Kollywood film. I don't think the movie in particular shows any 'depressing realities' either, I've seen plenty of darker Indian movies. Seems like a very odd claim to me to be honest.  The article you linked kinda says the same thing. It was a totally new thing for western audiences so that made it distinct and sorta gave it an identity. Whereas it's just another movie here, and even worse, just a big bunch of cliches."

ABCDesis,3biq1o,TaazaPlaza,18,Tue Jun 30 02:34:51 2015 UTC,"Which was the last movie you saw about depressing realities in the US ? Movies are entertainment, and most people go to movies to be immersed in a different world - not just in India, but everywhere.   'Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home' has 300 ratings on rotten tomatoes (even after it won all kinds of awards) and 'The proposal' has 800,000 ratings (it still has a much lower score than the former).

ABCDesis,3biq1o,asdfioho,6,Wed Jul 1 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"People like that though. Someone interviewed Yash Chopra about why he only showed rich people in his films, and his response was that movies serve as a sort of escape for people. Something along the lines of ""if life is already hard, why emphasize that in film?"" It's a film philosophy, that you go to the movies like you go to the circus. Cinema has been expanding, but it stays the same.   Regarding ethnicity, what you see is what the culture reflects. Early Bollywood saw things through the life of rich high caste Punjabi Hindus (usually those who moved from Pakistan to Mumbai/Delhi) because that's the demographic that formed early Bollywood. I think Bollywood's much more diverse now (which is also why the films show relatively less rich people), but look at the budding Punjabi movie industry. Everything is through the lens of well-off landowning Jatt Sikhs, often with NRI aspirations and tie-ins.   Now, in India, there are ""art"" movies outside of Bollywood, which are generally realistic and on actual social topics. Most of these movies are not popular among the actual bulk of India's population and thus generally pander to elites."
ABCDesis,3biq1o,book-of-kells,5,Mon Jun 29 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"I actually feel that in terms of heroines that it's less diverse now.

Just some examples. They are very diverse in looks as well as background. Now compare to modern heroines: Shraddha Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Alia Bhatt, and a whole bunch of actresses who are basically half-white. The only ones who are a bit different are Kangana and Vidya Balan.   There seems to have been more crossover from South to North. To my knowledge actors such as Gemini Ganesan ('Miss Mary') and Saroja Devi have acted in Hindi films as well as South Indian films."
ABCDesis,3biq1o,asdfioho,3,Mon Jun 29 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"The half-white is an interesting point. I was thinking about the 50s, dominated by Kapoors, Khannas, Dutts, Chopras, Oberoi's, and so on. Even the superstar was Rajendra Kumar, from Sialkot Punjab originally. Then there was a period of the ""Khan's,"" and the 2000s which diversified a lot. I honestly stopped watching Bollywood movies full-stop after 2010, so I'm not too caught up with how it is now."
ABCDesis,3biq1o,book-of-kells,7,Mon Jun 29 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"I blog about Indian cinema from the '40s to '60s and I collect Indian film memorabilia and magazines from that same period. I have also read several filmi biographies.  In the '40s and '50s, the major male stars were Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, and Dilip Kumar. I believe Dilip Kumar is an Awadhi-speaking Pathan Muslim. The Kapoors always claimed that they were Pathans but they actually seemed to have just been Punjabi Khatris. Other big actors from that time: Ashok Kumar and Kishore Kumar (Bengali, brothers), Bharat Bhushan, Pradeep Kumar, Sunil Dutt (Mohyal Brahmin Punjabi), Balraj Sahni, Rehman. Rajendra Kumar was coming up, he was more a star of the Sixties. I believe that Shammi Kapoor got his big break with 'Tumsa Nahin Dekha' (1957). And who could forget Guru Dutt? Probably the only Bollywood actor of the 20th century of South Indian origin - Guru Dutt was Konkani Saraswat Brahmin, if I'm not mistaken, and he spoke fluent Kannada as well.  For the Sixties we have the above stars plus Shashi Kapoor, Dharmendra, occasional Bengali crossovers such as Biswajeet and Uttam Kumar, and at the very end of the Sixties we have Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar.  I believe for the longest time, the heroines of Bollywood were actually more diverse than the heroes. In the '80s we addtionally got Rekha, Sridevi and Meenakshi Sheshadri from the South. I believe Shabana Azmi and Tabu are Hyderabadi Muslims (they are related)."
ABCDesis,3biq1o,asdfioho,3,Mon Jun 29 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"That's super interesting! Thanks for the input. Regarding Dilip Kumar, I was under the impression he was actually a Hindko-speaking Peshawari Muslim (Raj Kapoor's family is also originally from Peshawar), and that he changed his name to fit the industry bill better. Maybe that too was a coverup of sorts? I've also heard about the Kapoors being Pathan, and although they look awfully like ethnic Pashtuns/Pathans, Kapoor is a Khatri name.   Dharmendra is pretty interesting. He was from a rural Punjabi background, and pretty much the first to break Bollywood. He was massively popular in rural Punjab--even today, he's a legend as he is someone many rural Punjabis relate to. His name is technically pronounced in Punjabi ""Dharmindar"" with a hard Dh, but he Hindi-ized it for the Bollywood.   Anyways, cool discussion! I'm pretty interested in all this because of the historical tie-in (how Punjabi Hindu refugees settled into India), and also because I love a lot of these old movies (Mera Naam Joker for the win). I know as a general consensus Bollywood movies are getting much better compared to the cliched romances of the old, but the new movies just don't appeal to me at all. Probably because they're for the new generation of actual Indians, which I'm not a part of."

I used to watch Hindi movies as a child, but I find it painful to watch them now. I would say that upper-cast Hindu heroes are the least of their problems. I find that they dialogues are bad, acting is bad (people are casted as heroes / heroines just because they are lighter skinned), the cast is predictable (the lighter skinned actors are the protagonist, the darker skinned actors are the idiots/comic relief, the help or the bad guys), the plots are riddled with holes and very cookie cutter.   I've tried watching a few movies on Netflix and the only one I liked was 'Madras Cafe', all the others was so painful. I watch a lot of foreign movies, and would like to see a more movies from Bollywood with more depth in them."

ABCDesis,3biq1o,JeffMurdock_,2,Tue Jun 30 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"Gangs of Wasseypur is sort of the complete antithesis of the point that /u/rac3r5 is making.  The ""protagonist"" of the duology is a dark-skinned Muslim character played by a dark-skinned Muslim actor.  The antagonist is a fair-skinned higher caste Hindu.  The dialogues are stellar, although a lot of the linguistic humour is lost in translation.  The acting is hit-and-miss, but most of the central cast (especially Manoj Bajpai, Richa Chadda and Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is pretty spot-on.  The plot is again not water-tight, but much better than your usual masala fare.  Those movies join Dev.D, Kaminey and Haider in a very short list of contemporary Hindi movies I would watch in a heartbeat."

I was so into it and was so excited because after season 2, I can start watching The Flash and when I'm caught up with The Flash and Arrow I'll be all set to watch Legends of Tomorrow when it airs.    But I lost my patience (at least temporarily) with the show. They had already whitewashed an Asian character and made Amanda Waller skinny, then they whitewashed another Asian character who was pivotal in the comics, and I'm pretty sure Ra's Al Ghul is gonna be another white guy. I'm trying to tell myself that it evens out since they added an original black character John Diggle and they made The Flash's future wife black too but I feel heartbroken lol. Now no one, especially kids, watching these shows will know about these cool comic book characters.    To top it all off, I tried looking for discussions about the whitewashing in Arrow to cheer myself up and found the Arrow subreddit downvoting someone else who was upset about it, and someone even said ""You can be racist against white people too"" IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT CASTING ASIAN CHARACTERS AS WHITE lol.

And I think I still think it for the most part, they aren't sold as ""skin colour"" they're just sold as a colour.   However, if a child has an expectation that a plaster/bandaid is meant to match their skin colour then it could be seen as ""I don't match it, I don't have the right skin colour"" and maybe making a broader range of plasters/bandaids eliminates this and makes it less of a potential 'thing'.   There has been research into colours of dolls and how many children see the white ones as the good ones, so there is some underlying psychology to skin colour perception in children. It might not be just a PC gone mad type reaction...?!  Also, I'd quite like other colours (to my own skin tone) to wear :)"

But just as a duty to my principles, which recognize compassion as a vital part of life, I'll just quote Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh who said something which forever changed the way I view other people:   When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over.

Think of it as your last chance to 'make peace' before the end, after which there will never be a chance to get closure again.

ABCDesis,3bcp7h,arjun10,9,Sat Jun 27 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"Climate change means crop failures in India, mega-floods in Pakistan, catastrophic sea level rise in Bangladesh, glacial lake outburst floods in the Himalayas, extreme heat in Sri Lanka. This is different from the kind of localized pollution you're talking about.  This isn't rhetoric. According to the World Resources Institute, just 7 Western countries are responsible for 58% of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850-2007: the US, Russia, Germany, UK, France, Canada, and Ukraine.  And of that, the United State is single-handedly responsible for 28.8% of cumulative global GHG emissions. That means if Karachi sinks into the ocean by 2060, the U.S. may be 28.8% responsible.  This is absolutely not an excuse for South Asian nations to engage in dirty growth. But they didn't create the problem. The industrialized west did."

ABCDesis,3bbt8m,anirvan,10,Sun Jun 28 05:44:24 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming, sorry.  I'm not sure about their friends as I've never spoken with them about homosexuality. But in general I think my parents are more uptight and reserved than their friends. They were both raised in very rigid environments. Imagine if Downton Abbey took place in Pakistan.  I'll tell you a story that happened last week to give you a better idea of my mom's point of view. My mom and sister had just come home from somewhere so I came downstairs to say hi. My sister asked me if I knew that a distant relative of ours was gay.  ""No,"" I said, ""did he come out?""  My sister said, ""yeah he came out to his parents.""  Trying NOT to rock the boat since my mom was in the room, all I said was, ""that's nice.""  My mom looked at me pretty angrily but didn't say anything. I asked her what was with the look.  Mom: Why do you look so happy?  Me: All I said was that it's nice that he came out.  Mom: You didn't just say it's nice. You started dancing bhangra when you heard. Why do you always defend wrong things?  (By ""wrong"" things, she means the fact that I've openly discussed my misgivings with organized religion, my advocacy of marijuana decriminalization, and now, of course, my support of homosexuality.  As a quick aside, and I've mentioned this on this subreddit before, there's a guy in my community, a few years older than me, who everyone in my generation has suspected of being gay since we were teenagers. Let's just call him Adam. Adam has all the mannerisms and patterns of speech of your stereotypical gay dude. Last year he had an arranged marriage with a girl from Pakistan. The wedding was super awkward, they had no chemistry, and they got divorced a few months later. To make things worse, the girl told everyone that Adam was unable to, uh, perform his marital duties.)  Back to the convo with my mom.  Me: It's not wrong. Look, I'm sorry I wasn't raised in Pakistan under Zia ul-Haq. I was raised in America and it's not a big deal here.   Mom: So you think it's a good thing?  Me: Yes, I think it's a good thing that he's being open with his family. Or would you prefer that he hides it and gets pressured into marriage to cover it up like Adam did? That's so much better.  Sister: Oooohhhhh he got you there.  My mom figured there was nothing more she could say and just kind of quietly said, ""why do you defend wrong things."" And that was that.  Interestingly, we had almost the same conversation today when she told me the son from some super pious family in our town got engaged to a white girl. She was acting like it was the worst thing in the world.   It pisses me off that she's so closed-minded, especially because I've always been super open-minded despite my environment. I guess it just sucks cause I know my own happiness and sense of fulfillment will always be secondary to her expectations."

I'm gay and my parents know and don't like it, so we all just kind of pretend that it doesn't exist and I'm devoid of any sexuality. Anytime anything sexuality-related is on TV (even for example Viagra/Cialis commercials), they awkwardly change the channel trying to be subtle about it but it's so obvious. I hate the whole awkwardness of it all.   We usually eat dinner somewhere between 6-7 and watch the news at the same time. Yesterday I delayed dinner until 6:45ish by saying I wasn't hungry yet (I was) after which I knew it wouldn't be covered in the nightly news programs. Today we ended up eating dinner at 6:30, so it was again in the headlines and we all quietly pretended it didn't exist until my dad changed the channel. I gobbled up my food and left under the guise of having to rinse my mouth out. Yesterday when I was helping my dad with work, I made sure the radio was off before he got into the car because he usually listens to NPR and I knew it'd be constantly spoken about.  Sigh. I'm sick of this bullshit. I can't wait to go back to school in August so I don't have to tiptoe around this. I'm never getting married anyway so it's almost irrelevant to me (not saying it's not important for everyone else). I wish my parents were at least more ambivalent towards it, instead of obviously repulsed (but trying to seem uncaring). My best friend from childhood is obviously gay and they like him and he's welcome to our house but his gayness is ignored too.  So many of the other replies are like ""oh my parents were like, why not extend rights to others too"" and I'm like, heh, I wish my parents could be half as accepting."

I just wish they were more accepting and open-minded and less judgmental of it.  I am very close to my family (parents and extended) and I don't want to lose them. Therefore I just live with being [back] in the closet when it comes to them. I'm open with all my close friends at home and at school; none of them give a damn. But, I can't just do like the whole ""it gets better"" thing and leave and go move to a city and be gay; unlike white people (sorry for the blanket statement), I can't leave my family (they're too important for me), and it's really a one-or-the-other scenario.

While queerness can be a little confusing to them (they've privately asked me questions like ""so which one is the husband?""), they know several gay and lesbian community members, and I've seen them stand up for LGBTQ inclusion in community spaces since at least 1999.  They wouldn't think of themselves as flag-waving straight allies — they're just normal well-meaning people. As I get older, I hope I'm able to do the same, to risk my standing in my community to speak up for the rights of others, even if I don't fully understand someone else's situation.  To me, seeing my parents really speaks to the importance of coming out visibly in the heart of the community. And also how useful the rhetoric of marriage is. My parents wouldn't want to shut out LGBTQ community members from an institution that means so much to them; as my dad says, ""Is is better to marry, or to sleep around?

You can be the most neurotypical person ever, and still have serious issues, because abuse doesn't make people healthy.  You need to make sure your therapist is aware of your living situation. Nothing - CBT, meditiation, medication, prayer - works in a high-pressure, recriminatory, toxic environment like you describe.

ABCDesis,3bc23a,bug-bear,2,Sat Jun 27 23:11:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep listening to your therapist about your parents. Finding the right medication is a process, and it takes time. I tried 4 different medications until I found the right one for me.   I'm not sure what advice /r/anxiety and /r/depression gave you, so forgive me if I am repeating things that they have said (it usually is the same advice because that's what generally works - but you have to fine-tune it to work right for you.) For example, for depression, I found that walks outside - in the sunlight helped me. Anxiety, working out helped me. The key to something like working out is finding the type of exercise that you will enjoy and that helps you mentally. For me, running doesn't work (it does for some people though). I liked weight lifting. Now I like dancing/hula hooping - I like things that I need to focus on.   Do your parents not like the medication bit because they feel that you 'don't really have anxiety/stop making things up'? My father was this way. He didn't really understand what GAD was. My therapist printed off a packet that explained what it was medically to give to him, so he could try and understand what was going on. Maybe see if your therapist or psychiatrist can help explain it from a medical standpoint. It's possible your parents will be more accepting if it's coming from a 'professional'."

That's as polite as I can get in terms of framing your post.   However, as an atheist and a secularist it was extremely alarming to see the pendulum of opinion swing so far the other way that sharia law was seen as justified.   Shariah law is a part of Islam. It encompasses a lot of things, from ritualistic cleansing, inheritance, prayer rites, etc. It also dictates issues like when, to whom, and how much obligatory charity should be given. There are different interpretations of Shariah and different approaches to Shariah. Some are obligatory issues and are non-negotiable as far as theology is concerned, while others are pretty lax and are not obligatory. Banning Shariah law is basically banning Islam.  Secondly, there is no way that .3% of the population of the United States that are Muslim are going to find any way to enforce Shariah law on 99.8% of non-Muslim Americans. If you think this is probable, then you'd be stupid.  Bobby Jindal is using fear mongering tactics, to garner hatred towards an extremely tiny minority to score political points at the behest of Muslim Americans.     I'm sorry. But don't the governments in the Middle East practice sharia law? Where its OK for the state to officially practice bigotry against women, gays, atheists/agnostics, apostates/blasphemers,people of other religions, among many others.   No, the only country that recognizes Shariah law in the Middle East as the official law of the land is Saudi Arabia and Iran. Their interpretation of Shariah are entirely different from each other and are mired in cultural as well as regional traditions.   Other governments might accommodate Shariah law in terms of personal issues. India also accommodates Shariah law into its system, while not explicitly being a nation run by Shariah.   I strongly suggest you read up on issues regarding Shariah, learn a few things about the Middle East and its complex nature and then read up on the Muslim community here in America.

Let's see if we can break this down a bit. shall we? NO ONE has said that Shariah law in the USA was justified (which, btw, happens to be a pretty kick-ass track).  What was said by /u/x6tance was that a person should actually understand what Shariah means rather than blindly agreeing with talking heads about how it's going to be adopted any second here (hint: it's not).  What I said in response to a user dismissing Shariah is that our legal system, though primarily Anglican, has evolved from multiple sources, and a Supreme Court Chief Justice has recognized that other systems, including Islamic law, has shaped our country's laws and values. To dismiss that is to dismiss the history of our own form of government and legislation.  You seem to have a narrow understanding of what Shariah is, because it also grants women the right to own property and the ability to divorce (way before any of those rights were granted to women by Anglican law), which, again, justifies /u/x6tance's point that people should actually learn about the subject matter before having knee-jerk reactions.  Again, NO ONE IS ADVOCATING FOR THE ADOPTION OF SHARIAH HERE. Go read a book."

ABCDesis,3bbwzj,asoons,8,Sun Jun 28 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Like a broken clock which shows the correct time twice a day, a lot of things will have one or two good things, while all else is wrong.   Sharia maybe have some positive aspects about it, but these are laws written in the Arabian deserts around 650AD, and unlike other laws, have basically stayed unchanged for 1400 yrs.  So while shariah laws may allow women to own property, and women to divorce, it is also the shariah that allows men to marry 4 women while women can have only one husband, and treat women significantly inferior to men in almost every aspect of life.   The most unpleasant aspect of shariah laws is that they are still the rule of land in the vast majority of Muslim countries and their populations have to put up with these laws, because these countries are essentially dictatorships.  Most other laws written 1000s of years back have become obsolete, while muslims still praise the shariah laws.   Finally: the law-makers panel inside the supreme court designed were by an architect and does not imply that those figures have shaped our country's laws, but rather that they did make laws that have affected a large number of people. So just because mohammed has been included does not imply that the Islamic law has shaped any part of our country's form of government of legislation."

The only thing that was said about it was ""go learn a bit more about it rather than listening to political hacks yell and scream at each other.""  The values held by Islamic law, Christian law, or even German law are fundamentally different than what we have in this country and it would be the fall of this great Republic if the Constitution and the Code of Federal Regulations, along with local statutes were replaced with any foreign form of legalese.  So when I see something like:   it was extremely alarming to see the pendulum of opinion swing so far the other way that sharia law was seen as justified   I'm going to call it out because it is fundamentally disingenuous to say learning about another system of law, one that's been derived from a culture that has influenced and shaped western societies, is the same as justifying it. Studying history and anthropology isn't the same as condoning the learnings."

Not to mention that some of the mocking has crossed boundaries that involve his children and some have gone so far as to attack them. A #billclintonissoblack tag would offend many people and would have been met with more criticism.......but, now that I think about it, a #billclintonissoblack trend would be hilarious.  Anyways, despite these caveats, it really does seem like people are grasping at straws to defend Bobby Jindal. The fact that many Indians want to lighten their skin does not reveal any sort of cognitive dissonance in my opinion. It's irrelevant because Jindal seems to desire nothing more than to shed his heritage and assimilate with white America, not just change the color of his skin and become a non hyphenated American. His objections to a hyphenated American identity is not just a passive, fleeting reflection of a society that doesn't take race into consideration, it's more of a deliberate attempt to impose the idea that White American is the only American. This non hyphenated American bullshit he talks anout is just an attempt to hide the racism that he has internalized. It's pathetic, and it reveals an inscencirity that people hate to see in politicians, probably because it's so typical of the profession.   I believe that his attempts to leverage his heritage and personal beliefs to gain votes seem, at least to me, completely transparent and unconvincing. I mean, the man is extremely well educated and earned a BS in biology, and yet he professes to believe in creationism. Even in the case that he believes his own shit, it doesn't make it any easier to like him and understand his stance, regadless of his true beliefs.   Skin whitening creams may reveal a deep insecurity within the Desi community but Jindal takes such racial complexes to a much more dangerous level."

ABCDesis,3bbgs9,GodModeONE,2,Sat Jun 27 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"If you do it with proper technique, backbends, wheel pose and bow pose are great for back strength.  Back and side leg lifts and side planks are also helpful.  In general you want to be super, super careful with back exercises, since overexertion and injury can have dire consequences. You're dealing with the spine and the muscles that allow you to be upright.   So ease into the exercises, and be very, very, very, very careful with form. My advice would be to start with doing 1/2 the weight and/or reps you think you can do, and start increasing 10% a week once you're confident with form.  EDIT: I forgot to mention bridge. Once you have developed some strength, you can do bridge with only the tips of the toes on the ground (aka on half pointe), for an extra range of motion and stability challenge."

Also, it's not rigid like many people think. It's encompassing of different cultures and localities provided it doesn't go against the main sources of the Islamic Law.   People hear of its most severe punishment systems and think it's heretic without even considering the conditions required for many of them.  So, anyways, in a more idealistic world, Sharia of India will differ from that of Turkey. They got different cultures and it'll affect that. Sharia hasn't been in place for a really long time regardless of what you hear on the TV and stuff. ISIS and all that cal is definitely not Sharia. For those who think so, I suggest you read up about Sharia from the actual sources instead of being spoon fed information from biased sources. We're all educated enough to think critically, yeah?

ABCDesis,3b7aa0,Nylese,9,Fri Jun 26 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"Some highlights from the ruling   The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered.   mic drop"

ABCDesis,3b541g,GWmyc2,58,Fri Jun 26 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I have to disagree with you.  When someone like Bobby Jindal tells the world that he's tired of hyphenated Americans, it's offensive to me.  He got elected precisely BECAUSE he has completely embraced whiteness and expects other members of our community to do the same. Leaving their deplorable politics aside, people like Bobby Jindal & Nikki Haley identify as white not only when it is politically convenient for them, but then they also have the gall to expect other desis to get on board. Fuck. That.   I've said it on this sub before and publicly as well - you are free to embrace or reject whatever part of your heritage you deem fit. But I have a visceral reaction to anyone who expects me to erase my Desi-ness to make white folks more comfortable, and Bobby Jindal/Nikki Haley are part of that. It's especially egregious precisely because of their origins, make no mistake.  So, yes, shame on Bobby and shame on Nikki for their baldfaced willingness to hang my community out to dry for their own selfish political ambitions. It is absolutely a race issue, and I will not apologize for calling them 'whitewashed' or a disgrace to the South Asian community. My Desi-ness is not something I can just take on or off when it suits me, and they of all people should know that.   Bringing up South Asian Christians in this context is a non-sequitur. Bringing up nicknames in this context is a non-sequitur. Bringing up their ACTIONS is what's relevant to this conversation. People like Nikki and Bobby imply that I have to shed my Desi identity in order to be successful in this country, when it's obviously not fucking true. It is a constant struggle within the rest of American society not to reject my roots or be ashamed of who I am. Where the fuck do two desis get off implying that I should be ashamed of who I am?"
ABCDesis,3b541g,feetintheair12,21,Fri Jun 26 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I had a discussion on the IRC about this earlier, and while I agree with you that people have a fundamental right to identify as they please, and I do identify as Bangladeshi-American, it's a bit more complex than that.  To be fair, I don't think that Jindal necessarily means what you imply he does. He said what he did in the context of asking why some some identify first in name with their ethnic subcommunity, and secondarily with their nationality.  What makes this even more complicated, is that, to some extent this is not only a matter of personal choice, but also a matter of external labeling. I am aware that I identify as Bangladeshi-American not only because of my inclinations, but also because all non-white people have a ""dashed identity"" imposed on them, simply because we look different. White people are allowed to be ""generic Americans,"" but there's a lot of resistance to non-white people calling themselves that. An Italian-American IS allowed to ""take their ethnicity on and off at will,"" but not an Indian-American.  A lot of the imposition of dashed-label is racism from (mainly) white people, who view non-white people as foreigners. At the same time, a big chunk the labeling comes from my own community - to the uncles and aunties, I am called ""Bangalee"" as opposed to ""American,"" even though I was born here, studied here, and my entire family (including extended family) is here. There's a lot of talk like ""we do X, as opposed to Americans who do Y."" Even more mind-bogglingly, they view my European citizen student-visa fiance as my ""American boyfriend."" Within my own community, we're perpetuating the same racist message - my skin and ethnicity make me un-American, despite being born here and completely immersed here, whereas (the very non-American) Mr. Sunshinestarved is ""American"" because he's a white, blue-eyed dude.  So while I don't advocate most of what escapes Bobby's mouth, I do think it's worth investigating how other people's expectations affect how we describe our identity. It's important to decide if you identify as Desi-American because that is your identity, or if it's a reaction to being considered foreign by xenophobic, or something you were forced into by your parents. It's important to take a moment to acknowledge that dashed identities do imply an ""otherness.""   More importantly, we should examine whether we are imposing labels on other people because they happen to have a similar color to us. I'm very adamant about this because while I'm the sister that does ""cultural"" things, my brother identifies more with ""coder"" and ""American dude,"" and I constantly have to defend him from being called various types of ""race traitor."" (FWIW my brother is extremely politically progressive.) I feel like suggesting Bobby Jindal needs to be ""more Indian"" is as fair as him expecting us to be less Indian. No one owes you anything because they are the same ethnicity. Freedom of choice implies he's allowed to choose his own path and identity, just as you are.  And finally if indeed you feel like Bobby and Nikki are setting the wrong example, support progressive desi candidates, and become involved in the political process yourself. Personally, I think we have a difficult time mobilizing a pro-desi progressive political movement because we progressives are very critical about how someone isn't quite desi enough. For example, there's a lot of criticism about how Preet Bharara has prosecuted desis, or how someone like Kshama Sawant ""doesn't represent traditional values.""  EDIT: I need sleep. I can't words."
ABCDesis,3b541g,serenissima_regina,3,Fri Jun 26 04:03:03 2015 UTC,Thanks. I would love to be no hyphenated one day.
ABCDesis,3b541g,steamywords,7,Sat Jun 27 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent points. I do agree that Desi-shaming is a very real phenomenon, and it happens far too often in our own communities. We are constantly policing other desis for their level of identification within the culture, and I agree that external racism has something to do with it.   However, my identification as Desi also has to do with resistance to a system that implies that there is only one way to ""be American."" People like Bobby Jindal & Nikki Haley represent the full extent of that mindset, and it is especially egregious coming from them because they should know better. No matter how many times I've tried to run away from it, I cannot shake off what I was raised with - the food, the clothes, the close extended family, the language my family speaks, etc. It is all too dear to me.   And yes, there is more than one way to identify as Desi and to express Desi identities, especially since the subcontinent itself is such a vast and varied place. I too have been called ""whitewashed"" more times than I can count, and it hurts. There is more than one way to celebrate Desiness and fit into our communities that doesn't necessarily involve joining the college Bhangra team, doing Bharatanatyam or speaking a certain language (all of which are valid expressions of Desi identity.)  But when a person with power and a political platform explicitly rejects their Desi identity and then expresses an expectation for others to reject the idea of being a hyphenated American, that too is a form of identity policing. It fits into a dominant, white supremacist narrative that shames me for my brownness and simultaneously puts me in a racial box from which I can't escape.   FWIW, I think Preet Bharara or Kshama Sawant would be fantastic candidates for office (especially as someone who is quite far to the left!) Also, who says Kshama doesn't represent traditional values? She is directly from India and India was a socialist republic upon its formation. I haven't personally heard criticism of Preet prosecuting Desis, either. If anything, he's been commended for his work on rooting out corruption in the state of New York. I also hope Kamala Harris takes the California Senate seat she is vying for."

See I feel the same way. My brother doesn't. I feel like both of us needed to be treated equally in our community, but we're not.   then expresses an expectation for others to reject the idea of being a hyphenated American, that too is a form of identity policing.   Yes, of course it is. I'm just not sure a correct response is to police his identity back.  Apart from Jindal's dickwaddery, what I personally struggle with, as someone who does buy into the idea of being hyphenated, is whether with my label I'm actually perpetuating racist ideas imposed upon me. Am I encouraging people to view me as an ""other?"" By calling myself a dashed identity, am I buying into a way of thinking where a white man walking is ""a person walking by"" but me walking is ""an Indian woman walking by?""  I have very different reasoning than Jindal, but sometimes I wonder whether fewer self-references to our ethnicity, and more to our personhood and Americanness, might disrupt racist and xenophobic ways of thinking."
ABCDesis,3b541g,serenissima_regina,4,Fri Jun 26 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course it is. I'm just not sure a correct response is to police his identity back.   I think it's a perfectly fair response. Especially since he explicitly trafficks in whiteness and engages in reactionary racial politics for his own gain. You have to take the criticism in context: this is a guy running for president, which makes him very high profile and one of the few Indian-Americans in the public eye. I don't want his notion of identity to be the only acceptable notion / the only way that makes us palatable to the rest of America. He demonstrates and performs whiteness as a form of aspiration, which puts unrealistic expectations on other desis to aspire to whiteness (which is already wrapped in really toxic notions of the model minority ideology, white supremacy, etc.)   I have very different reasoning than Jindal, but sometimes I wonder whether fewer self-references to our ethnicity, and more to our personhood and Americanness, might disrupt racist and xenophobic ways of thinking.   The racial history of America has demonstrated otherwise. We live in a country that does not (and probably will never) view us as ""just"" Americans. Colorblind ideology doesn't eliminate racism - talking about racism openly will eliminate racism."

I feel like returning in kind is a race to the bottom, and no one wins.   We live in a country that does not (and probably will never) view us as ""just"" Americans. Colorblind ideology doesn't eliminate racism - talking about racism openly will eliminate racism.   Yes, we're not viewed as ""just"" Americans now. However it's an open question about how we will be viewed in 100 years. Some previously ""foreign"" groups are now viewed as ""just"" Americans, and some are not.  Unfortunately, history indicates that talking about racism doesn't eliminate racism. To a large extent, talking about racism only engages the non-racists, it's basically preaching to the choir.  Changing conditions for minorities involves engaging the ambivalent and racist people and turning them into allies. That's the only way that there's enough of a plurality for lasting social and legal change. Historically this is how slavery ended, and how the civil rights and women's rights movements made great progress.  It's very hard to do this is we insist on using divisive language and congregate in our own little subcommunities. I am very very concerned that this trend is contributing to reversing progress on civil rights and women's rights. The whole ""tumblrista"" trend (of which this Jindal-baiting is part) creates more reactionaries than it attracts allies."

Civil rights activists fought hard against the status quo to pass laws that a good chunk of Americans were ambivalent about and used disruptive but important tactics to ensure that their message was heard. Yes, Dr. King had a dream, but let's not forget how harrowing their resistance actually was.    It's very hard to do this is we insist on using divisive language and congregate in our own little subcommunities. I am very very concerned that this trend is contributing to reversing progress on civil rights and women's rights.    What type of divisive language is being used? It's the right-wing section of the Republican Party and their allies who are being divisive. How is insisting that hyphenated identities be discarded and that everyone just assimilate into ""American-ness"" not divisive? I am not suggesting that we congregate in our own little sub-communities. You can have the best of both identities. There are multiple ways to express American & Desi identities, but the prominence of people like Bobby Jindal counteracts that idea."
ABCDesis,3b541g,feetintheair12,4,Fri Jun 26 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"Except that's not true. Civil rights activists fought hard against the status quo to pass laws that a good chunk of Americans were ambivalent about and used disruptive but important tactics to ensure that their message was heard.    I'm not suggesting that civil rights activists chilled out.  But you can fight hard in productive ways, and in unproductive ways.  In general, the movements (such as that centered around MLK) that were effective emphasized common identities with people in power, to generate enough support from allies to create change. Whereas movements like Black Power (which is IMHO fair), were so divisive that they were (and are) widely reviled.  Basically it's totally ""fair"" to fight back, to trade insult for insult. The Black Power movement is, from a logical viewpoint, fair - you're totally justified in violently fighting a system that has systemically hurt you. But any plan that involves hostility will not generate allies, it will just invite backlash since no one wants to join a movement where they're the enemy.  I'm not suggesting that Bobby Jindal is right. His speech was awful. But at the same time I think it's totally fair to question what places ethnic identity and nationalism should have. We're a minority in a democracy, insularity does have real consequences. If our progressive movement is better at generating backlash rather than creating alliances, we're basically alienating voters and lawmakers, and that has consequences for all minorities. It's not fair, but I'd rather bear an unfair burden and create more allies for oppressed minorities.   the prominence of people like Bobby Jindal counteracts that idea.   The prominence of people like Bobby Jindal suggests that desi progressives are doing a very poor job. Successful leadership involves pragmatism, rather than idealism, and an ability to work with incremental change. To make things better, you sometimes have to do ""unfair"" things."
ABCDesis,3b541g,serenissima_regina,4,Fri Jun 26 07:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that the Twitter/Tumblr crowd skews fairly privileged - generally college-educated, often in the liberal arts. We're not the people for whom progressive changes - non-discrimination, equal wages, immigration rights - are an immediate priority.  When we do something that's emotionally satisfying to us, such as an ad-hominem attack on Bobby Jindal, we have to keep in mind that we're not the people who feel the backlash. The main criticism I hear of the progressive movement from disadvantaged people is that it's often about the feelings and ideologies and careers of the upper-middle-class, rather than about the reality on the ground for less privileged people.  So by all means, we should fight, but there is a value in being aware of the long-term consequences of cheapening the debate, and stooping to the level of the basest debater."

ABCDesis,3b541g,PeterBrewmaker,2,Fri Jun 26 06:19:26 2015 UTC,I find that discussions are cheapened or strengthened largely on the basis of how substantive the starting point is.

ABCDesis,3b541g,naseusDNA,6,Fri Jun 26 03:52:00 2015 UTC,The twitter campaign feels like online bullying to me and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But then again I think Jindal himself indulged in some bullying against minorities. So I guess he is getting a taste of his own medicine.
ABCDesis,3b541g,geardownlandings,6,Fri Jun 26 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"Dude..this is fantastically well put! I would like someone to address these contradictions in his persona/campaign: of becoming ""Indian"" when it is convenient. For political gain."

How have they hung your community out to dry?  They are elected to represent and govern all the citizens of their states.   He got elected precisely BECAUSE he has completely embraced whiteness   Further goes against your point.  If he was elected by abandoning his ethnicity, not embracing it, then even from the perspective of liberal identity politics, he doesn't owe you anything."

I used to be one to call out Haley and Jondal but now I just wish we found something more productive to talk about
ABCDesis,3b541g,newdawn15,2,Fri Jun 26 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this thread will yield more nuanced discussions rather than a continuation of the usual ""lol uncle bobby"" nonsense we've had in the sub lately."
ABCDesis,3b541g,asoons,10,Fri Jun 26 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"There's some pretty good discussion in the comments - which surprised me for thread about Bobby Jindal!  I wanted to add some context to this discussion, specifically around his comments about hyphenated Americans. I don't think that criticism of him is centered around him being the 'wrong' kind of desi. There is no 'right' way to be a desi. Indeed, we all struggle with this to some extent, as /u/GWmyc2 pointed out.  His remarks about hyphenated Americans are from a speech he made earlier this year (transcript here)  In it, he indulges in some pretty cool Islamophobia, and suggests that maybe discrimination against Muslims wouldn't be such a problem if only they would assimilate, like he did.   It's pretty clear that he denies the validity of the hyphenated American experience not just for himself, but for for everyone else. We can defend him for choosing his own path, but he is not going to extend the same courtesy to any of us."
ABCDesis,3b541g,serenissima_regina,2,Fri Jun 26 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much sums it up. Bobby Jindal, totally a Desi, totally an asshole."
ABCDesis,3b541g,x6tance,16,Mon Jun 29 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"I feel that the dislike for him is not just a matter of his having changed his name or his religion. A majority of the current generation of Desis are pretty liberal, and he has adopted the politics generally associated with white evangelicals and the extreme religious right in America, that too the worst and most hateful aspects of it. Many of us have personally known and felt the scorn and bigoted attitudes of that segment of conservatives, from bitter experience.   You brought up that quote of his about identifying only as American and not an ""hyphenated American,"" but do you recall the context in which he made this statement? It was part of a whole speech in London dedicated to fear mongering about Muslims in America and in the West - the same one in which he claimed that Muslims had established and imposed Sharia law upon ""no-go zones"" in parts of the West. He presented himself as the ideal example of someone who had assimilated into American society, who had become a true ""American"", to draw a contrast to those Muslims he chastised as being resistant to or having failed at assimilation and as holding on to different values and customs. He went so far as to claim that immigrants who don't assimilate are essentially seeking to ""colonize Western countries."" His quote about rejecting ""hyphenated Americans"" was not made in the spirit of celebrating diversity and inclusion, of having various cultures and religions recognized as equal parts of the American social fabric. Instead, he sought to marginalize and raise irrational fears about Muslims and other immigrants who want to retain religious and cultural values which differ from those white conservatives associate with American identity. It's one thing for him to define his American experience in terms of his radical assimilation, and another entirely when he demands it of others and demonizes those who don't."
ABCDesis,3b541g,hahaheehaha,3,Fri Jun 26 03:25:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the dislike for him from a lot of people go beyond the superficial perception of his name and religion. Even in this thread we have quotes like:   I didn't change my name, I didn't convert religions, I speak to my family with my mother tongue, and I didn't forget my roots.   People really did start a campaign because he doesn't fit the mold of what a Desi should be, and it's being perpetuated by other Desis. That's where I have a problem."
ABCDesis,3b541g,_QED,3,Fri Jun 26 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I struggled a lot with my own conversion because so many people define ""desi"" as ""Hindu"" or ""Muslim"" (even though I'm from a really secular family, and most of what I knew about Islam was not from my immediate family). I went through years where I would have described myself as agreeing with Christianity more than Islam, but I felt I owed it to ""my people"" to identify as Muslim. I do think that once I realized I can defend the rather beleaguered American Muslim minority and still be Christian, the decision got easier.  Also the other thing is that there's been Christians in India for a really long time. Parts of India have been Christian longer than a lot of Europe. So it might be worth thinking about European Christians as having followed desis rather than the other way around."
ABCDesis,3b541g,hahaheehaha,2,Fri Jun 26 05:11:10 2015 UTC,"You converted to Christianity from Islam? Fascinating! Never heard of a Desi like that, just a couple Iranians!"
ABCDesis,3b541g,_QED,4,Fri Jun 26 06:32:13 2015 UTC,What I really love is how much people pretend to be tolerant until religion comes into play. One of the central tenants of Hinduism is that all religions are basically the same and whether you call him God/Jesus/Allah/Yahweh/whatever God is still God. Desi people are more tolerant of an atheist than they are of a person converting to another religion.
ABCDesis,3b541g,hahaheehaha,0,Fri Jun 26 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"He quoted me, and my point wasn't that you have to be a certain religion to be considered Indian. But when Jindal pretty much erased all parts of is cultural identity, along with his religion, you can blatantly see that he's distancing himself with his roots. Religion was not the focus."
ABCDesis,3b541g,_QED,4,Fri Jun 26 11:23:23 2015 UTC,"My point still stands. Desi people in general do not tolerate a change of religion. If you want to take that as a jab at you, that is your prerogative."
ABCDesis,3b541g,hahaheehaha,-3,Fri Jun 26 14:18:18 2015 UTC,Yeah your point stands if you generalize 1.5 billion people

You believe what you believe, I don't give a shit. A man who chooses to believe what he wants to believe is his business, how the hell do you know if he is or isn't genuine in those beliefs? You can call him a race traitor, you can say he panders to the white folks, you can see he isn't brown enough for you, but the truth is all you've done is generalize about the man because of your feelings. You want to argue his politics, that is something different. The truth is everyone is upset about his choices he made and are attacking him for it. You have your opinions about it and didn't exactly derail the conversation, so while I disagree about your attitude of being offended by Bobby Jindal's life choices I didn't downvote you."
ABCDesis,3b541g,FaFaRog,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"I could care less about his choices and how brown he is. The reason I feel so strongly on this is because when Indians like Jindal are in a status of national prominence, what do they do? They forget their entire culture. Now, it's not their responsibility to be figureheads for an entire race, but people like him perpetuate the belief that you have to be ashamed of your culture once you come to the US or that you have to be white to be successful. Look at Nikki Haley, she did the exact same thing.  If he distanced himself from his culture, that's one thing. But when he distances himself from his culture and takes on another one, that evokes a strong suspicion of pandering and people like me are doing nothing but calling him out on it."
ABCDesis,3b541g,_QED,0,Fri Jun 26 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"People really did start a campaign because he doesn't fit the mold of what a Desi should be, and it's being perpetuated by other Desis. That's where I have a problem.   Great.  Now you have to make the argument for why we should all have a problem with it, rather than just you.     Because I do the calculation in my mind, and I see 40 pieces of iron on the ""Jindal is an asshole who gets what he deserves"" scale and maybe a piece of copper on the ""Maybe we should be a little fairer to him on Twitter"" side.  So tell us why this is a broader community issue, rather than attempting to police us."
ABCDesis,3b541g,PeterBrewmaker,-1,Fri Jun 26 06:55:15 2015 UTC,"Ok you quoted me. Since name, religion, and language don't constitute being a Desi, what does? What does it mean to be Indian? Is it simply skin color?  Are name, religion, and language not components of a culture?"
ABCDesis,3b541g,allhailkodos,2,Fri Jun 26 11:20:39 2015 UTC,Indian as an identity is a fairly new concept. There is no simple answer to your question.

Baton Rouge did not have a lot of desis when he was growing up and was not as tolerant/progressive as it has been in the last ten years (doesn't excuse his behavior but sort of makes it logical) . If he had continued to push for growth and progress in Louisiana, I would still vote for him even though his whole pandering to the white good ol boy network makes me roll my eyes. However, he has destroyed this state singlehandedly and he deserves a really embarrassing election run.   I cannot wait to watch a Perry/Jindal/Trump debate!  Edit: I think my perspective may be different because of the issues that are important to different people. For most Louisianians, we are more concerned about how to fix health csre and education as well as job stability in the oil/gas sector. Immigration, while a very important topic, is lower on the list for most of us."

ABCDesis,3b541g,oinkyy,5,Sat Jun 27 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that people should be judged on their politics and not on their racial authenticity and Twitter is a particularly bad medium for getting at that nuance (at least in the micro level).  At the same time, I wonder to what extent such an attitude is a denial of race rather than an appreciation of how thoroughly imbued we all are in it, including Jindal.  The idea that we live in a society where a blank slate, race-neutral political criteria can be developed may simply be fubar.  So, given the context, of course Jindal is going to be judged by other Desis, and of course some of them are going to mix up authenticity arguments and political ones.  This has deeper roots.  A major social issue for American capitalist society is how to bring Latino folk, LGB people, some women, middle class Black people, Asian Americans, inoffensive and depoliticized trans folk like Caitlyn Jenner etc. into the fold of the middle class and the elite. In the past, this was done through the expansion of Whiteness (to the Irish, to Jewish people, to Italians, to Greeks, etc.) But this transparently won't work now and, voila, we have Democratic Party style affirmative action loving elite multiculturalism. That is what hyphenation is about and that is the context in which to understand how Jindal positions himself.  That is what the Twitter people you're talking about are engaging in (mixing up identity and political self / attitudes).  In that context, making the dated argument (it's very 90s) that America should be a melting pot and not a salad bowl as Jindal is doing draws on assimilitationist and, I would say, racist legacies and dogwhistles. At the same time, it takes a very legitimate issue (the fake, non radical multiculturalism of the Democratic Party / social establishment) and subjects it to the most troglodytic critiques. It is, quite simply, the worst that anyone in any position of power who falls in the categories above could do on race these days, short of going full D'Souza.  Edit: TL;DR - Yeah it's fucked up, but he started it."

ABCDesis,3b541g,oinkyy,2,Fri Jun 26 12:08:31 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about this myself. I wanted to write something about it too, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that you brought up the issue yourself.  This is honestly a really confusing issue for me, there are plenty of well-reasoned and respectful arguments coming from a variety of viewpoints in the comments.  And I definitely agree with a lot of what you're saying, he's saying and doing a lot of untasteful things (and the way he's disclaimed his origins is disconcerting) — but that doesn't change the fact that our reactions to him are also problematic.  I feel bad that he probably had to go through a ton of bullying and feeling isolated as a kid (it's safe to say that his decision to convert and rename himself was based on social pressures and racism, rather than being a completely independent action on his part).   I think it's within his rights to attempt to become 'more white',  and it's shortsighted of us to criticize him for that (especially because he probably went through a lot of what many of us have, even if he reacted differently to it).  But at the same time it's extremely disappointing that he's taking a lot of actions and positions that hurt minorities and people like himself; you would like to think he would be able to draw on his own experiences and better relate in these situations. There, the claims of disclaiming his heritage do have more validity, I think."

If I can be a little specific about one of this social policies - anti-gay marriage. The reason people immigrate from countries like india is because they want to escape the social prejudice and persecution.

I call my mother ""Mom"" or much less often when switching to Kannada, Amma.  I'm more likely to say something like ""Mom [Kannada]"". I ended up calling my grandmothers Amma and Ajji and my grandfathers Ajja and Tata mainly because my mother would always call her mother Amma when referring to her, and her father Ajja when talking about them to me.  So I followed her lead.  My mom's a first generation immigrant who calls her dad, Daddy and she called her mother, Mummy.   OTOH, my cousins all model calling my aunt Ajji for their children.

My main issue with folks like Bobby is that they make it seem like you have to give everything up about your Desi identity to be accepted in America.   I'm not quite sure how to articulate it, especially since I have days where I feel insecure or uncomfortable. But that's normal and ok and part of being human. However, coming to terms with your identity is a process of trial and error, and it doesn't happen overnight. You'll figure out what works for you and what doesn't."

All these desis getting tribal rage over a bullshit opinion that could never influence policy, but no one wants to talk about how fucked up his legislative actions and views are.   Not having heard the full context of his statement, I can only speculate, but I can possibly see his point. Ethnicity and Nationality are two different things.

She is a politician, she identifies herself as white and as a minority when it suits her need. She had initially said that the attack in Charleston was a non-racial incident.

So many other countries will make you jump through a million hoops if you want to invest in the motherland or simply deny that option entirely.  I have invested in India and will probably continue to do so in the future.  The returns are far better than anything I can get in the US.

The returns are far better than anything I can get in the US.   It comes with considerable risk, though. A good portion of our portfolio is Indian rupee-based assets and, despite the 8-9% returns, rapid inflation erodes much of it. It's not so bad if you plan on keeping the account in rupees only and investing in Indian-based companies, but if you look at the USD-INR exchange rate trend you'll see that it's not such a fantastic return when you want to spend any of that overseas or buy dollar-denominated assets on the market.   India's govt is also somewhat schizophrenic, to put it mildly. I can never guess if the government is going to put land controls, currency limitations, or kick out an MNC at any given moment. The tendency to smile and nod to your face, tell you what you want to hear, and then do the complete opposite isn't just a social trait... it's also pervasive in business practices. And it's damn risky.   Endemic corruption is another obvious risk factor. The balance sheets turned in to various agencies may or may not be legit. Organizations pay huge bribes all the time for officials to overlook awful business practices and outright fraudulent activities. Then there's the fact that redressal is a lengthy (also usually corrupt) process.   I'm not sure how you've been ""investing in India,"" but I know I do it with considerable caution. I've already thought of liquidating quite a few holdings now that the RBI has raised the overseas direct investment limit."

I own a plot of land now in a commercial neighborhood and I am getting a whole bunch of very attractive offers to sell."
ABCDesis,3ax54x,immilaw,3,Fri Jun 26 21:22:18 2015 UTC,Anyone who invested in real estate in early 2000s probably made 5-10 times their initial investment by now. It probably won't continue like that forever but any bribes you pay will be just a tiny drop in the long term returns you will get. Enough advertisement.

ABCDesis,3ax54x,trctn4238934,2,Wed Jun 24 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Real estate in India is a dicey proposition. I know many who have become nouveau riche practically overnight from their generational family land holdings... but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy real estate without considerable connections.   For one, the paperwork and survey details may have become mysteriously lost in some government office. Or, a conflict of ownership arises. What you think is acquiring a clean and clear land title suddenly becomes problematic because some relative's aunt died and while she was willing to sell her 10% share, the person inheriting the land no longer wants to sell. It's common for land to belong to 10 different people in the form of a makeshift corporation.  Then there's the need for a heavy percent to be in black money (or, under-the-table cash). Unless you have large stores of cash sitting under your mattress, it's damn hard to enter a land deal.   Then... there's squatting. Foreign buyers especially have the problem of acquiring land, only to visit the property years later and find houses or businesses built on their property. Suddenly these people are saying the land is theirs, and they bought off the police to side with them. You can take them to court, but it's such a lengthy battle that people find themselves paying their squatters a significant sum just to go away.   Oh, local governments also have the nasty habit of usurping the land under the guise of ""public need."" You then get stuck with pennies on the dollar during the sale. This is partly because the reported land value is always significantly less than its reported value. This is great from the perspective of paying taxes... but can bite a person in the ass if the government likes your holdings.   I'd never recommend an American-born Indian with no connections to their country to go over and pick up a piece of land. Or even a condo."

It's this market of which I'm most distrusting. For one, politicians and India's elite use these holdings to park their black money. India's finally taking action against tax evaders. While this is a good thing, cracking down on such under-the-table transactions has significant consequences on luxury real estate purchases: demand is driven down considerably. There just aren't as many buyers because they're taking a ""wait and see"" approach as it relates to coming regulations.  Second, the luxury real estate market is becoming over-saturated. It, along with commercial real estate buildings, have enormous shells that are quickly resembling ghost towns/abandoned projects. I know countless people who have put a stay on their construction or who are having a hard time renting out their new buildings.   Anyway, I recognize that I can't be too critical of Indian real estate because it'd be hypocritical.

ABCDesis,3avhcs,Tal-IGN,4,Tue Jun 23 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"For the record, this is a bit sensationalized as a lot of Canadian media likes to do with Sikh extremism. Most of the media coverage on this issue makes it seem like all these Canadian Sikhs are putting these pictures up of these terrorists, laughingly knowing at he did and proud of the slaughter of innocents. The reality is that the Sikhs who remember him [again a minority] are not malicious but misinformed.   IMO, the bombers were Sikh and should all be punished as such, but the general narrative the community has taken is that this was an attack that the Indian government staged to malign the Khalistan movement. Books like Soft Target are used to support this theory. AGAIN, I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS THEORY. But it's there. So Sikhs aren't celebrating a mass murderer. They just deny that Parmar did it. How could there be this much cognitive dissonance, one may ask? when you have a culture back in Punjab that had tons of police officers and soldiers shoot civilians and call them terrorists after the fact, when police officers would hire local criminals to infiltrate Khalistani organizations and such, people brought that mistrust of government to assume that anything of this sort was of the wrong intention. Even I grew up thinking that there was no way Sikhs could have done that, as it didn't align with any interpretation of any Sikh religious or even Sikh political belief. Ultimately, after a lot of reading and such, I think the facts do show that Parmar and co are guilty. I try to, on an individual level, raise awareness among the community that this is not someone we should remember in a positive light The reason he is memorialized is that he's seen as someone who fought against a corrupt police force and died at their hands.   These kind of articles never create any meaningful dialogue. They paint all Sikhs to be blood-thirsty demons laughing in glee at the torment of those who suffered on Air India 182. I will stand up against this, but I will also stand up against the fact that those who cruelly massacred Sikh civilians and stomped over their human rights in the 1980s-1990s in India, instruments of state terrorism like Kanwar Pal Gill and CM, are revered in India as heroes. Tell me, who stands up against them? Who stands up for the murder of human rights activists that uncovered thousands of murders at the hand of the state? There needs to be a two-sided dialogue instead of this muddling of facts on both sides, Sikh and non-Sikh.  EDIT: And for the record, I am NOT a Khalistani. My family lives in Punjab, India, and I support the state staying a part of the country. Nonetheless, I should add that supporting the idea of Khalistan (which in my idea is bone-headed and shows ignorance) is no more supportive of these terrorists and murderers than being a proud Indian means you're supportive of the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms in Delhi."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 23 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well, Sikhi is the Sikh philosophy and I don't think it had anything to do with Khalistan in the first place. Divorcing Sikh history, or Sikh culture, is different. For one, those who honor militants or martyrs are not always Khalistani; I personally abhor the idea of Khalistan, but to me I still admire those who fought against what I see as a corrupt system. The people who are celebrated are celebrated in the vein of fighting an oppressive government; most of them are not even remembered for being Khalistani, and like I said, those who support Parmar don't support Parmar the killer but Parmar the freedom fighter who was framed by the Indian govt (which I feel is a false narrative).    They hijacked the narrative entirely. And, where there is evidence for khalidtani terrorism, such as in this story, they deny all responsibility and blame it on RAW.   Yeah, this is one thing that I really feel was just way too much even for the militancy movement. That's why people deny it. It doesn't help that Indian media outlets would blame every single Khalistani on ISI in return as well.    I want to let you know that us non Sikhs, particularly those of us Hindus from Punjab, don't find you all to be ""hateful/blood thirsty demons.""   Of course not. But there is a sort of hypocrisy I've noticed when Sikhs speak up politically. For example, I don't know if you know about Khalsa Aid, but it's a Sikh organization that goes to disaster sites and gives aid, purely on donations. It's an expansion of the Sikh concept of seva. Great, right? The founder Ravi Singh is an extremely humble man, and helps people of all religions and ethnicities. Yet, Khalsa Aid also does aid for Sikh families afflicted by the police or govt in 1984, and Ravi Singh on Bluestar's anniversary made a social media post about how bad it was for Sikhs. There were instant responses from many of his supporters on how bad it was that he was supporting terrorism and Khalistan, and how he was a traitor to India, and so on. It's the same hypocrisy that Sikhs felt crushed by in the 80s."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"I meant more along the lines of the Khalsa after its creation by Guru Gobind Singh Ji at Anandpur Saab. Like, for some of the Khalsa Panth and maybe the Ameitdaris, Sikhi and a Sikh homeland such as khalistan go hand in hand. Something that comes to mind is the partial phrase of ""raj karega khalsa."" Which to me means, khalsa reign. So, that's what I meant by it may be difficult to divorce sikhi from the concept of a nation.   Ah okay, got what you mean. In my opinion, even the concept of Khalsa must be divorced from Khalistan. (warning, my own theological musings approaching). The concept of Khalsa-Sikhs as a unique Panth/qaum, and the idea of ""Raj Karega Khalsa,"" has been around for a long time. Many Khalsa traditionally saw it as an actual rule of the Khalsa. However, I think the idea of Khalistan is more related to 20th century ideologues on nationality and the effect of right-wing movements reaching their peak. The idea of a modern Khalistan nation-state is a lot different than the idea of a Khalsa rule as was traditionally concerned. I also feel that even the idea of Khalsa rule as many Khalsa espoused was different from Guru Gobind Singh. Guru Gobind Singh certainly kept his own sovereignty over Anandpur Sahib, a land that was his own. However, in all his battles, he never claimed a single iota of land conquered. All was given back. He was even willing to cooperate with the Mughals/Hill Rajas at select times. I think his idea of self-sovereignty and a metaphysical Khalsa raj are useful today, but not in the sense of Khalistan/an independent Sikh state.    is it ethical to support Parmar the freedom fighter while not acknowledging parmar the murderer?    Again, I don't agree with those who support him. But if you see someone as a freedom fighter who was framed by the Indian government, there's not an ethical problem I would think so much as a gap in logic.    And, what can we say about a diaspora (maybe to broad of a group for me to cite) which fails to at the very least consider that he murdered hundred of people   I think it speaks a lot about the diaspora. I was actually watching one of the trial processions from the whole Air India, and at one point someone mentioned the connection of distrust of Canadian law enforcement to distrust of law enforcement back home. I didn't really understand why people denied it, until I made that connection. Back at home in Punjab, you had several cases of Sikhs being alienated by the government using them as scapegoats. I remember watching an interview of Bluestar where a Sewadar at Harimandir Sahib was jailed and his legs broken for his ""terrorism."" My own grandfather was jailed for 4 years on no charge. For god's sake, some media outlets tried to pin the blame of the Bhopal gas disaster on Sikh militants. KP Gill's strategies included torturing people until they ""admitted"" to terrorism (think Animal Farm/Stalin), and hiring common criminals to infiltrate militant organizations and see the underpinnings. When you have this culture, and you then have this incident that pretty much the overwhelming bulk of the Sikh community was very against, then you can see why Parmar was seen as innocent. My family actually knew him; he was a very kind, humble, and gentlemen figure, albeit brave which is why people revered him originally. Looking at the evidence, though, it seems that Bluestar struck a cord with him that just made him erratic and willing to harm that many people.    Take it one step further, how accurate is the Khalistani narrative overall if they drop the ball on this one guy? Maybe their methodology is further flawed?   Of course it's contrived to an extent. I'm equally wary of sites like NEVERFORGET1984.COM or SIKHLIONZ.COM alongside KP Gill's autobiography, because both serve as propaganda. That said, there is a consistency in the stories you hear, a consistency that is supported by the voice of human rights activists, the narratives of police who come out with their heinous crimes years later, the facts established by basic witness testimony.   How accurate is India's narrative on the whole issue? When they need to kill people like Jaswant Singh Khalra who provide facts about human rights abuses? When Bluestar was originally supposedly something done in haste over three weeks, yet later evidence comes up that they were planning it for years and had even asked the British for help? When anthropologists trying to understand teh militants' side are attacked by groups of thugs?   If so, it's really probably out of jealousy   Don't really know about this, so I won't really address it. Maybe it's the case, I don't really know.   Regarding India, I do think things are much better and getting so. Again, my family lives in India and they're content with it, and I think although I'm not an Indian myself I'm fine with its integrity as a nation-state. I'm generally not a fan of PM Manmohan Singh at all, but I think the point is well-made as a whole--TBH, I think most Punjabi Sikh issues today are not a result of unequal treatment from the center as I would diagnose in the 80s-90s, but rather the warped politics of the Sikh Badals ruling Punjab today."

He's forbidden to go drinking after 10 PM!   One of his quotes, I believe in an interview or from a book called ""War at the Top of the World"", KPS Gill states: ""It takes a Jatt to defeat another Jatt,"" which is why he was selected to his position.   My take on AI 182: This is the only harm that Sikhs have probably ever done on humanity. It just shows that even Sikhs are humans just like me."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,trctn4238934,0,Tue Jun 23 23:56:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't read much about what happened during that period in Punjab. But from what little I came across it's not very different from other insurgencies that happened or are still happening in India. And this applies to both sides. Things get nasty whenever the government involves a large number of police or the army in counter terrorism operations. Insurgents target anyone they don't like. Government forces prefer to make people disappear or 'encounter' them rather than try them in courts. This applies whether the insurgency is in Punjab, Kashmir, North East or the Naxalite infested central India. There are police officers who are celebrated as 'encounter specialists'(Encounter is the Indian term for shootouts). There is wide spread public support for encountering people involved in terrorism or other heinous crimes. So the police do it and then get rewarded for it with public recognition and medals. This encourages some assholes to look for people to 'encounter'. Police encounters have gone down a lot in recent times as most of the insurgencies in mainland India died but they continue to happen now and then.  I think people's support for encounters arises from their lack of trust in the efficiency and capability of the judicial process. They see terrorists languishing in Jails for decades after being sentenced to death for heinous terrorist acts and the next time some army operation kills a bunch of 'terrorists' they think - 'Good, instant justice'. I think so too to a certain extent. If there is a genuine gun battle(meaning there are casualties on both sides), I don't care if the dead terrorists were killed during or after the gun battle.  P.S I don't think the article paints all Sikhs as blood-thirsty demons. It just shows that there are assholes on both sides of the Khalistani Movement. Most non Sikhs in India view Sikhs in a positive light and recognize their service in Indian military. You are right when you said that KP Gill is considered a hero, but he is seen as a Sikh hero. And he is not recognized for just what he did in Punjab. He went on to advice and train the police forces of other states on how to quash insurgencies in their states. That is how I came first came across his name. He was listed as an adviser for my state's police forces on matters related to Naxalites.  TLDR: That is how insurgencies are dealt with in India and the sub-continent to a larger extent. We haven't yet learned the art of fine grained control and application of justice in insurgent infested areas."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,2,Wed Jun 24 00:15:50 2015 UTC,"Caveat: I'm very apprehensive of the way India handled the situations in Kashmir and NE as well. But anyways, I can see your point to an extent. An example I'd give is a high-profile militant is caught and put on trial. Nobody wants to give witness because his associates make them fear at the gun. What should they do? I can understand there's some necessity for extrajudicial killings when dealing with militants.  However, that's not what KP Gill did in Punjab, nor why Sikhs are upset. Let me narrate the whole story of the human rights activist I mentioned. Jaswant Singh Khalra was working alongside Amnesty International and was investigating police records. He found a lot of cremated bodies; illegally and discretely done so, under police command. His research would find that over 20,000 Sikh civilians were killed under the guise of terrorism; that is, police officers would round people up, shoot them, label them as terrorists, and accrue the rewards associated with that. Khalra presented his findings, and the next day, he was kidnapped by the police and later found dead in a ditch. How do you justify this? The story of this man? Big news splashed recently when Ajit Sandhu, another big police officer, committed suicide. He was according to KP Gill ""harassed"" by human rights organizations and by the mothers of the innocent children he had killed. These initiatives created more militants out of people tired of police corruption.    I don't think the article paints all Sikhs as blood-thirsty demons. It just shows that there are assholes on both sides of the Khalistani Movement. Most non Sikhs in India view Sikhs in a positive light and recognize their service in Indian military   Again, this is the double-edged sword often found in minority relations within India. The British also were quite fond of Sikhs in the military, but apprehensive of Akali politics when it infringed on their rule. Almost any Sikh who wants to raise awareness about Bluestar, or supports the militants cause (note that does not mean Khalistan/supporting killing of innocents) is painted as such, as ""extremists"" or ""separatists.""    You are right when you said that KP Gill is considered a hero, but he is seen as a Sikh hero. And he is not recognized for just what he did in Punjab. He went on to advice and train the police forces of other states on how to quash insurgencies in their states. That is how I came first came across his name   Question--if KP Gill decided that all means were necessary to quash Khalistan and keep the integrity of India, including killing civilians and breaking a LOT of laws (i.e., hiring petty criminals to infiltrate organizations), what is the difference between him and Parmar who also thought that all means were necessary to create Khalistan? It becomes a matter of which political ideology you believe in more-so than any type of higher moral ground."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,trctn4238934,2,Wed Jun 24 01:24:22 2015 UTC,Almost any Sikh who wants to raise awareness about Bluestar ... is branded a terrorist.   There is a distinction between people trying to raise awareness of human rights abuses committed by the Police and people who are sympathetic to the separatist cause. The former may not find many listeners but they are never branded as terrorists or extremists. Maybe they were in the Indira Gandhi era but not anymore. She had a penchant to crush anyone who goes against her.   what is the difference between him and Parmar?   I agree that there isn't a moral high ground here but the difference I think is that KP Gill answers to our elected government. People like Parmar answer to no one except themselves. The reason why KP Gill is considered a hero has nothing to do with his morality. He is a hero because he quashed what most Indians see as a harmful movement. I think you can say the same for a lot of national heroes created in times of conflict. If George Washington killed a few suspected British Spies without trial he would still be a hero in the USA. Indira Gandhi is responsible for the darkest time in our history since Independence(emergency) and a lot of other bad things. But to many Indians she is still a hero because she crushed Pakistan in the 1971 war and died because she went against people trying to divide the country. We have a shit ton of government schemes named after her today(mostly because congress want's to use her image. But they cannot do that if the people don't have a sympathetic view of her).
ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,0,Wed Jun 24 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"The former may not find many listeners but they are never branded as terrorists or extremists   a live example for you would be Ravi Singh leading Khalsa Aid. He discussed human rights abuses during Bluestar as well as how his humanitarian organization aids those suffering from 1984 and his social media was flooded with responses calling him a Khalistani sympathizer. Generally, there's been empathy with victims of 1984 Delhi  pogroms (mainly because of anti-Congress fervor and a need to counter the Modi-Gujrat issue) but Bluestar and Punjab itself is still a hot topic.    people who are sympathetic to the separatist cause   On this note, there's a distinction between being a Khalistani and sympathizing with militants. Given a precarious situation where the state killed even civilians, I'm not surprised people took up arms against the state--outside of killing innocents/civilians, to do so is considered acceptable in Sikh philosophy as well.   KP Gill answers to our elected government. People like Parmar answer to no one except themselves   Except KP Gill and CM Beant Singh were given a blank check to counter the movement by presidential rule, and Beant Singh's election left out a significant portion of the Akali electorate. The same issue arose in Kashmir with Congressi ballot stuffing followed by Indira's imposition of presidential rule. There's a reason why a good portion of people felt their voice was heard via arms more than the ballot, and the answer isn't Pakistani agencies.   The reason why KP Gill is considered a hero has nothing to do with his morality. He is a hero because he quashed what most Indians see as a harmful movement. I think you can say the same for a lot of national heroes created in times of conflict. If George Washington killed a few suspected British Spies without trial he would still be a hero in the USA.   And that's why many Sikhs still feel alienated by many Indians who didn't live under KP Gill and didn't experience his ""heroism"" face to face. Just like the woman in the article is alienated by Parmar. If it was a case of Gill killing a few civilians without trial, he wouldn't be remembered in modern Sikh conscience as ""the butcher of Punjab."" He was responsible for the illegal and indiscreet killing of over 25,000 civilians across Punjab. If he still had control, he would also have killed the human rights activists and media that exposed the polices crimes, as seen when he called the makers of a Punjabi mocie on 1984 ""terrorists who should be treated as such"". Whether he's responsible for the end of the movement is debatable as well; most people just got tired of the militants, who had started infighting and whose lack of a longterm goal was showing. A lot of these civilian deaths simply created more militants-see the film Maachis or Punjab 1984. The death of CM Beant Singh led to a large relief in human rights abuses, and simultaneously the movement declined.    But to many Indians she is still a hero because she crushed Pakistan in the 1971 war and died because she went against people trying to divide the country   People should also be aware of the extent she buffered Bhindranwale and spurred Kashmiri Islamists and directly created these problems.   And that, is why it seems there will always be a bridge between ""most Indians"" and the Sikh community, even if Khalistan is dead as a door nail. When Hindu nationalist ideologies are accepted today but Sikh nationalist ideologues warranted the killing of thousands of Sikh civilians, there's a serious lack of dialogue that I think will just permeate forever."

ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,0,Thu Jun 25 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Just like how Khalistani ideologues support the idea that Sikhs are the natural people of Punjab and therefore have a mandate to rule, Hindutva organizations believe Hindu civilization is the pure form of India and the ""foreign"" elements must be pruned out. That the former is separatist versus the second maintains the ""unity"" of the country simply depends on your own personal politics; at Partition, Sikhs specifically had lobbied the British to join India as Nehru had made promises (in the form of the Anandpur Resolution) which were ultimately ignored by the center. India has never been a historic nation, and it's ultimate culmination as such was the result of various groups like these joining India on conditions later fragrantly broken. There's also a hypocrisy when dealing with minority nationalist groups versus Hindu ones. Case in point--Shiv Sena had stated that ""Sikhs are no match for us, we have 100 Hindus for each Sikh in this country."" Bhindranwale responded by saying ""each Sikh can easily take 100 Hindus in combat."" Only the second was spun off as terrorist rhetoric.   Personally, I think it's wise for all India to remain integrated without any such nationalist dialogues."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,trctn4238934,3,Thu Jun 25 04:52:03 2015 UTC,"Case in point--Shiv Sena ....     Shiv Sena isn't looked in a favorable light in any state other than Maharashtra. Most educated middle class Indians including Hindus think that they are a bunch of bullies and goons whose ticket to power is bashing on non-Maharashtrians in Mumbai. Bhindranwale did more than just saying ""each Sikh can easily take 100 Hindus"" or demanding autonomy for Punjab. As far as I know Shiv Sena never brandished guns openly and never had a bunch followers who fortified themselves with machine guns in open defiance of the government.  If I remember correctly Akali Dal was engaged in protests in Punjab at the same time in support of their demands and their leadership wasn't targeted by the Govt.  If you want another example of Non Hindus who made provocative remarks look up this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbaruddin_Owaisi. He said some pretty nasty things about Hindus and all he got in return was a hate speech case and some jail time. People call him all sorts of names but he was never branded a terrorist by the govt. or the press. There is much more animosity between Hindus and Muslims than there is between Hindus and Sikhs and even this guy isn't killed off or branded a terrorist. Is there a difference in popular reaction between provocative remarks from Hindus and Non-Hindus? Sure there is because Hindus form the majority in India. Are Non-Hindus branded as terrorists and separatists because they made provocative remarks or hold unpopular opinions. No I don't agree with that. There are plenty of Muslims who made provocative remarks over the years and even engaged in some street level thuggery like Shiv Sena, but they aren't encountered or branded as terrorists by the govt.  I think the tipping point is when followers of a movement start taking up arms. As long as someone doesn't do that the govt. usually keeps to itself. If tomorrow VHP starts arming it's followers with guns then it would be banned in no time and branded as a terrorist or militant organization.  For the record I think Operation Blue Star was a bad move on Indira Gandhi's part and I think the Indian political leadership learned some valuable lessons from it. I don't think there will be another Operation Blue star in India anytime soon."
ABCDesis,3avhcs,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:32:07 2015 UTC,"I think your point on weapons is well-made; no country would permit someone like Bhindranwale. My greater point is how at an institutional level, minorities were treated as more of outsiders to India than the majority. Another example goes that Benaras at the time had a nomination as a Hindu holy city, yet when Sikh leadership tried to push the same for Amritsar, the media and government focused on the plight of Hindus in the city, who went to the streets with banners saying ""we shall drink and smoke with gusto."" In all honesty, I would agree with them; but there should have been equal treatment as for the Hindu cities.  The Akali leadership was peaceful, but they actually were labelled as anti-nationals very early on from the press by the Indian government (especially for their role protesting against the Emergency). The same applies to Kashmiri activists under Sheikh Abdullah. This is actually why Bhindranwale got all those cool machine guns in the first place--Indira permitted them and Congress members actually bolstered Bhindranwale as a way to counter the Akalis. Of course, Bhindranwale would later turn against this plan.  I think a bellicose group should be treated as such. That the Akalis, a group campaigning for more regional autonomy of Punjab within India, are compared to the likes of Shiv Sena who actively threatened Sikhs at the time says a good amount. Regarding the link you've posted, I think India has changed a good amount since the 80s and 90s, although the attitudes I've described still exist on right-leaving forums like /r/India. Again, there's a reason I support Punjab staying within India. I think there's been a lot of positive change, and the modern problems Sikhs face have to do with the regional Akali leadership and nothing to do with centralist bias."

My paternal grandparents ate mostly vegetarian food and were very strong in youth, but it was pretty unhealthy as it was lathered in butter and all and took its toll when they were older. My parents now have made good nutrition and exercise a center-point of our lives, and they've avoided pretty much all the ailments their parents have (they don't even have the typical aunty/uncle protruding bellies). Ironically, everyone tells them that they, my sister and I all are ""blessed with really good genes"" for our bodies, which may be true with regards to our height and broad shoulders, but is no way true for our overall health.   My point of this is not to be snobby, but emphasize that people use opportunities like this as an excuse when it's not the end of the world."

On top of that was saambar or some vegetable based curry and/or lentils with meat being eaten mostly on special occasions. Sugar was also a bit pricey so they didn't eat sweets much and even took their tea a quite bitter he said.   I think a lot of what we think of as the ""traditional"" Indian diet is mostly from the richest upper classes and didn't trickle down to the masses until a generation or so ago. Tossing some rice into a rice cooker is quick and easy, but by avoiding the temptation I've been managing to keep to a pretty decent macronutrient profile even while cooking mostly Indian food.

As for Indian food, stay away from ghee and use oil sparingly and it's very nutritious. Dals are a great source of both protein and iron. And of course vegetables are great for vitamins and fiber, things that are lacking in the standard American diet.   People are always hung up on protein, but unless you're malnourished you're very unlikely to actually get insufficient protein. The vast majority of Americans don't get enough fiber though.

ABCDesis,3atija,Throwthisawaysjs,3,Tue Jun 23 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure what type of deficiency you believe is a result of veg diets. But every major health org in the world finds veg diets to be appropriate for nearly everyone.   Dietetics organizations copypasta: All the major dietetics and health organizations in the world agree that vegan and vegetarian diets are just as healthy as omnivorous diets. Here are links to what some of them have to say on the subject: American Dietetic Association It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. Dietitians of Canada A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. The British National Health Service With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs. The British Nutrition Foundation A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. The Dietitians Association of Australia Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet. The United States Department of Agriculture Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. The National Health and Medical Research Council Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended. The Mayo Clinic A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them. The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada Vegetarian diets (see context) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.  There are veg athletes so you can certainly gain muscle on a veg diets. Since I'm not an athlete myself I would recommend checking out http://www.richroll.com/ he's a vegan fitness expert, not me."

I'm going to follow up on his coattails here with my own critiques...      She writes:   [Rachel] Dolezal, as a white woman, has been able to don some of the physical markers of blackness and “pass.” But for many black Americans and people of color marked by race, there is no ability to “pass” for white. Whether or not she ever does, Rachel Dolezal can return to the refuge of whiteness, should she choose.   This absolutely makes no fucking sense. Did she not pay attention to the way Dolezal became the biggest joke of the country over the last week? There is no safe refuge for her anymore. More importantly, did Eesha not see the black community abandon Rachel en masse when they found out she was a white woman in disguise the whole time?  Does this author even read anything outside of her own crap?   This is why Haley’s failure to acknowledge the racism at play in the Charleston shooting is important.    She just did. She was likely waiting for absolute confirmation that the killer was driven solely by race before making a huge political move in taking down the Confederate flag. Folks, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the killer never actually confessed that he was motivated by race. That fact was uncovered after cops investigated his background, his past activities, and the words he spoke during the shooting.  Hell, even in the article that Eesha linked to support her claim that the killer confessed to racism being the motive, the article never states that Dylann (the killer) confessed to racism as the primary motive here. In fact, the article ends with the following lines...   The full list of reasons that Roof entered a South Carolina church and, according to his confession, shot and killed nine people, might never be known.

ABCDesis,3atyxf,Brownhops,10,Tue Jun 23 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's pretty much a bullshit claim that Jatts use to make themselves feel special. While there is almost certainly the possibility of admixture from foreign populations from central Asia and the Middle East (as Punjab was a frontier at the tip of South Asia and did have a lot of ethnic mixing), I don't know if there's anything conclusive saying Jatts/Punjabis are all foreign. I know there is some research that suggests Punjabis have a proportionally higher incident of markers from outside, and some vague googling around made this come up, but even if there are some foreign markers, a significant portion of Jatt ancestry is native to South Asia.  There is a lot of this pseudo-history among fellow Jatts and it's honestly a bit cringey. One of the justifications for the Scythian theory that I've read on the wonderful ""Jatland wiki,"" is that Scythians used to traditionally adorn themselves with tattoos, and that Punjabi Jatts happen to have some cultural presence of tattoos (for example, Patt te morni, a tattoo of a peacock on a thigh to represent masculinity). Therefore, Jatts are Scythian descendants. There's also theories that Jatts are originally from Sindh, and there's a ton of theories that Jatts were originally Rajputs (apparently my ancestors with the same last name were Rajputs from Amber, Rajhasthan, that ruled Delhi).  As you can guess, these are all very contradictory to one another and not based in fact so much as vague conjecture trying to make bloodlines more ""special.""   The most ironic thing is that you'll hear a lot of this noise from Jatt Sikhs, yet most Sikh historical sources actually talk about the Jatts being technically ""low-caste"" and only being elevated by the Sikh institutions of the Khalsa (which are intended to be casteless). Personally, I'm proud of my rural ancestry: I'm proud of my ancestors that were a part of their native Punjab homeland for a long time, fought on it, and lived off of it. All these attempts to make us royal or foreign ultimately detract from that, at least for me."

The senator who gave the longest filibuster in history against integration later said that he found Christ's humility and realized racial injustice is wrong, also ""conveniently"" at the time when it became societally incorrect to be racist (at least publicly). Obama's more vocal of his support for gay marriage now than he was before. Again, while we can always use some analysis of the person's actual motives for the benefit of history, in this case it comes off as an opportunity to make us feel morally superior despite her ultimately taking the action that most of us desired.   EDIT: To put it more succinctly: in the other post where it was asked Desis demand Nikki take down the flag, what was our purpose? To produce this result.

ABCDesis,3aqy5v,touaregwanderlust,6,Tue Jun 23 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"I know this struggle for real. I have a high comprehension of Hindi and my spoken is okay (wasn't raised speaking Hindi, just picked it up as a child). I never learned to read or write in Hindi. I did SASLI in Madison, WI over 3 yrs ago, which was excellent. In three weeks (with a lot of hard work to sprint ahead) I moved from beginners to intermediate. In the full 8 weeks I went from no written experience to testing in and acing intermediate level courses and working through reading and writing quickly. As a graduate student I applied for CLS to use in Madison but I did not receive it. I was able to secure funding from endowment at my university, but even so...it felt weird that undergrads were getting the CLS but not a graduate student who focuses on South Asia. You would think they would want to offer the scholarship to students who are most likely to continue their use/application of the language in the long term-- i.e. someone who has a graduate track project. Who knows what their rational was though (shrug). A word of caution, I am not sure if this entirely true but I heard the CLS tends to favor recipients who are not 'heritage speakers.' It was something I heard along the way as I was applying, and perhaps that's what stood in my way.  The hardest part about doing either language is staying on top of it and the classroom setting does help. Three years after my language training I decided to refresh my skills as a doctoral student, so I did independent study/mentored language program b/c I wasn't really a 'fit' for any particular class level. The mentored approach really made a big difference b/c then the instructor focused on what I needed first and I did speaking practice with her and other students in the mentored program. Being a student helps immensely. Since that is not your case, you may want to look in the community (as parent's friends if they know perhaps someone who is a retired teacher from India or such?). OP do you have any family or friends who read/write/speak Hindi or Tamil fluently? A family friend of mine does medical translation work for immigrants at some of the area hospitals, and he's offered to help practice my Hindi.   I want to learn to read and write Gujarati for my research (I already speak it), but it seems to be equally difficult to find a teacher. I know that SASLI has a program for it, but if I end up in India doing my fieldwork I may just hire a tutor over there to get my writing up to speed (this is going to be as confusing as learning Spanish and Italian when I start writing).   I think the thing that took the longest to do is learn the characters. However once you do, everything moves faster-- especially if you already comprehend Hindi. I am not sure of your background and experience but if you have the ear for Hindi already then writing will come much more easily. You'll notice the differences in the sounds. One fortunate thing about Hindi is that it is written EXACTLY as it's said. If you speak it properly, you can read and write it perfectly."

My spoken Hindi is middling at best, but I can understand Hindi pretty well.  My Tamil, on the other hand, is atrocious. I know words, but putting sentences together/conjugating verbs/grammar in Tamil is extremely difficult for me, especially since the written & spoken versions of Tamil are so different from each other. Plus, my family uses all sorts of slang/variations on the language, which makes it even harder to learn. -_-  My entire family speaks both Tamil & Hindi, but they all work full-time/wouldn't be very good teachers. Tamil is so different from any language I've learned (i.e., it's not an Indo-European language), so the barriers to learning are high.

ABCDesis,3apxl2,theoneleggedrooster,9,Mon Jun 22 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"Writer here (trying to get the next book published)  It's not easy to be published. It's almost impossible. It's not that your book's idea or its contents are bad. It's that: who wants to read your book? You may have the orchidaceous prose of Rushdie and the explosive lilt of Roy, but you are still going to be sailing a tiny nobody-boat in a literary ocean if no one wants to read you.  So? What do you do?  Well, you follow the formula. You do the writing. Let the publishing house figure out the publishing part. After your final manuscript is done, an editor will pick through it (assuming you made it that far after countless rejections) to see what can be done to make it amenable to the target audience. The target audience is the distilled result of countless in-house marketing meetings where publishers, book store owners, and other folks get together with giant powerpoint slides with pie charts and graphs and hash out where the next big thing is.   Is it teenage vampire fiction? Is it nonfiction? Is it biographies? They figure it out, and give directions to the editors who then work your book to that mold. Meanwhile, marketing then does studies to see what books have sold (or not) and why, and then comes up with the optimal cover design for that market.  Long story short (one of my problems!) is that book cover designs undergo a Darwinian evolution of sorts. The ones that sell get replicated. The ones that don't are discarded. Eventually you reach a boring equilibrium in all genres until someone decides to break it out with something new, and then the story repeats itself."
ABCDesis,3apxl2,SabashChandraBose,15,Mon Jun 22 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'll offer up my crockpot theory:   The cover of these books are meant to appeal to the two demographics that would most likely buy these books - South Asian women and middle-aged Caucasian housewives. The latter group is especially important...you have to craft the covers carefully so as to reflect some of the preconceived notions they may have about South-Asian and Middle Eastern women. You see, part of the appeal of the book is its exotic setting, so you want to appeal to base stereotypes to quickly convey to your average white woman that the book takes place in a land unlike theirs.   But, at the same time, you don't want to completely alienate that Caucasian demographic, so you have to be remove any elements from the cover that may suggest that the book may be a little inaccessible to those that do not fully understand the culture. That's why you don't ever want to show a South-Asian woman's whole face on the cover. Maybe just a silhouette draped in a sari or a corner of the face would be enough to grab the attention of South-Asian women without risking losing potential Caucasian women readers.   Also keep in mind that you have to frame this exoticism in a way that can be easily consumed by somebody unfamiliar with that culture. Similar to what Panda Express does with Chinese food. So of course, the finer details of a particular culture may have to be diluted or even excised for the sake of simplicity. An unfair stereotype or two may have to be portrayed here just to present the illusion that the book doesn't deviate too far from whatever conceptions and misunderstandings the average white woman may have about South Asian culture. Like the misconception that South Asian and Middle Eastern women are oppressed, sexually and socially.   The end result is a book cover that's pretty similar to the covers of other books taking place in a Middle-Eastern or South-Asian setting.  sighs"

That's true. It's also true that you won't see any woman's whole face on a cover of a fiction book unless it's a romance novel. People want to project themselves onto the person, so you see a lot of headless faceless women with boobs. With non-white protagonists, the covers deemphasize skin. Even better, from the publisher's perspective is if you can get the design elements that say ""exotic"" without the person on it.  brb taking a picture of a  hennaed mango stuck in a jeweled sandal and sticking on top of a sari"

What also contributed to the violence in Punjab was right-wing religious groups that arose among Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims in the early 20th century (as a response to Christian missionaries/each other) that increased tension. For example, Arya Samajis in Western Punjab (Muslim-majority) stopped greeting one another with ""Salam Alaykum"" as was customary but chose distinct Hindu greetings (historically never used in that part of Punjab) as a means of asserting their identity. Nonetheless, I'm sure nobody could have anticipated the violence that occurred, and while obviously all sides are colored by their own biases, it's comforting to know that all parties at least indulge some level of responsibility. There's also a class factor not usually mentioned, as Western Punjab had a lot of poor Muslims but a lot of rich Hindu bankers and rich Sikh landowners.   Among Sikhs, violence is often memorialized in ballads known as dhadi vaars. The violence is usually in the context of warriors fighting usually with a martyrdom slant, such as Sikhs fighting the Mughals, the Afghans, or even more recently the Indian government. Many Sikhs used weapons (my great grandpa, the WWII one, included) and were killed in 1947 but no ballads are sung for the time period, as there is an admission of sorts that those were not noble deaths or a noble fight for a greater cause."

Short Answer: Overpaid number cruncher  Long Answer: Data Scientist/Data Analyst - I work for one of the tech giants, I specifically work on analytics for video games. Understanding player behavior in games that (ideally) help us make the game better but is typically used to sell items to them. e.g. if we find that a lot of players are dying due to a boss in certain level, we'll then work with the game designers to tweak the boss's difficultly or give players hints on how to beat the boss (or sell in-game items that'll make it easier).  The holy grail is to let machine learning do that job.  Do you enjoy it?  Day to day can get grindy and/or boring. Most of the time I'm just pulling some data to answer the curiosity of someone in leadership wearing a suit (figuratively, no one wears suits) but when I do get to work with game designers, see their passion to make the game genuinely better, I love it.

More opportunities are opening up everywhere as companies are investing in their big data infrastructure.  I'm not sure how hard it is to get an entry level job right now, but I think you should start applying for jobs, giving interviews, if anything to just see what skills you need to pick up.  There are also a lot of big data consulting firms that are training young grads to be data scientists, that could be another route."

ABCDesis,3an0ig,interstealer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"I studied Electrical Engineering. No masters. I was pretty lucky in my first job out of college.    I'm starting to get pretty intimidated by the sheer knowledge and skillset of people in the data science field...   Don't be. Data science is one of those areas that's currently filled with buzzwords. Hadoop, HIVE, Redshift, R, Python, Random Forest, are ALL buzzwords.   Yeah, having experience dealing with big data helps, but in the end your day to day is going to end up being 60-70% SQL, 20% excel and 10% actual predictive modelling. A lot of what we do is extremely exploratory.  A lot of the learning happens on the job, in big companies there are communities of data scientists and ML scientists that you can learn from.  As for what to do in grad school, I saw that you mentioned Kaggle - that's a really good resource. A lot of the problem sets I've seen on Kaggle are real problems companies are trying to solve. It gives you an idea on what the companies need. So pick up those skills.  Like I said before, you should just start applying for jobs and start giving interviews. If you don't make it, ask them for feedback - most good companies will tell you where you need to learn more."

ABCDesis,3an0ig,n3cr0ph4g1st,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:36:55 2015 UTC,Hey is a career in Data Science a bit too mathy or codey? Although im in compsci I hate coding but I like analyzing code and also like math and AI theory. This might be a bad question but how often do you have to code. Is jt just making connections from one set of data to another?
ABCDesis,3an0ig,Hot4_TeaCha,3,Wed Jun 24 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I had no comp sci background and I managed to pick up the coding pretty easily. My background was in public policy and econometrics in grad school and poli-sci/history in undergrad if that puts it in perspective.  If you can do basic queries in SQL and learn your way around a stats package like SPSS or R you'll be fine. Of course, back then it was much easier to learn these things on the job since data analysis/data viz hadn't yet become the sexy new job that everyone was going to school for. You could realistically tell people you were self-taught in an interview without getting a sideways look.   I also care a lot more about the analysis and interpretation aspects of the job, so I trade heavily on my communication and presentation skills. Knowing how to talk about and present findings in an accessible, easy-to-understand way helps a ton so I've taken a seminars on data visualization and read a lot of work by guys like Edward Tufte. I am also teaching myself some Python because from what I've seen it can be really good for developing interactive visualizations of data. I really can't stress enough how valuable it is to employers to have someone who can do the math AND talk about it with non-math people without making their eyes glaze over. I've basically been told multiple times that I'm highly resistant to downsizing because they can't hire for such a rare union of skill sets.  Of course, I'm moving into more senior project management roles now so I hope to have underlings to do the heavy lifting for me. But it is always important to have a keen understanding of exactly what the team you are managing have to do and what the tools they are working with a realistically capable of if you want to be a decent project manager."
ABCDesis,3an0ig,n3cr0ph4g1st,2,Mon Jun 22 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"How old are you? I switched focus after realizing I did not want to be a lab monkey, taught myself how to code and I have one year left of my MS in cs with an emphasis in big data and cloud computing. I definitely want to work as a data scientist for several years and eventually make my way into management. Any thoughts or advice?"
ABCDesis,3an0ig,Hot4_TeaCha,3,Mon Jun 22 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"I'm 30. To be perfectly honest, my slipping into it was a complete accident. I learned basic econometrics (which involves learning about stats packages) in graduate school and working at a tiny non-profit to pay for school (I was about 24 at the time). I was the only one with stats experience that they could hire, so I ended up with a lot of data and quant experience just because they couldn't afford to hire an actual quant person.   From there I got a job doing quantitative analysis for a consulting firm and now I do metrics analysis for a cyber security outfit.   It's a poorly understood and rapidly changing field, so any advice is going to have to be pretty generic. The biggest thing I can advise is that data analysis in the real world is a lot messier than what you learn in school. Data sets are poorly put together and not at all standardized. Document your process and methodology for everything (and don't tell people where and how you did it, because if they fire you you want them to miss you) and make sure any numbers you show to clients or even your boss can be replicated years later if you have to.   That and you will constantly be pressured to use numbers to stretch the truth. Especially if you're in a heavy sales or business directed company, the temptation to relent can be huge but it always bites you in the ass in the end. Don't ever let your name end up on a piece of crap. A reputation for integrity and trustworthiness goes a lot further than the approval of some pushy douchecanoe from marketing."
ABCDesis,3an0ig,analystdude,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"The generic advice you gave was pretty awesome man thanks for that. I am in school for another year, any tips on things I can do to make myself stand out? I am going to try Kaggle competitions but besides that is there anything else I can do? I also want to beef up my stats knowledge I don't know if you have experience or know of any good resources for that.   Also going forward, do you see yourself going into management, or are you enjoying the role you're currently in? I am trying to figure out what my end goal is and I think an MBA like 5 years down the line could help. Do you think it would?   I think documentation is going to be something I need to work on a lot haha, and the general advice you gave was great. Thanks again!"
ABCDesis,3an0ig,banana_tango,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much else there is. Learning Python will likely help a lot in addition to SQL and the like. It may also be good to have some communications or artistic background. Data Viz is a sexy field right now so if you can show up to an interview with a portfolio of elegant data visualization  or tasteful, presentation quality charts in your back pocket in case anyone asks, it would likely impress.   And of course, presentation skills are always valued.   I am actively trying to move into more of a project management role. I've liked the data field but as it gets more technically specialized I am, frankly, not that great at it anymore relative to new people out there. What I am still good at is knowing how to run a study and how to use data to inform decision-making, so I think that's where I can do the most good nowadays.   An MBA will probably help if you want to move into more of a management role. I would actively seek employment with a company that will help pay for it while you're young. The big consulting firms will do so and some of them, like Booz Allen, have pretty robust data analytics teams. Basically not having some kind of Masters degree will start to be a major roadblock to advancement after a point, so it's kind of necessary for anyone who wants a reliable way to claw their way into affluence. Also, going to grad school before 25 or 26 is just way more fun. I probably partied more in my 2 year masters program than all 4 years of college. And I could only manage a full courseload and a part time job because I was young enough to not need my beauty rest as badly as I do now."
ABCDesis,3an0ig,analystdude,5,Wed Jun 24 18:07:58 2015 UTC,"Hey! It does involve coding. A lot of what we do requires being able to manipulate terabytes of data so you need a good understanding of SQL and databases.  As for the analytics itself we use stat packages like R and Python. I myself prefer R, but a lot of other data scientists prefer Python, I think that's up to personal preferences, esp because now we've got R server that makes writing production ready code in R pretty straightforward.  As for knowledge of math - you don't need to be as proficient as a mathematician, but you do need to have a very good understanding of statistics and a little bit of calculus (in some cases).  Now data scientists come from a variety of backgrounds - physics, mech engg., math, comp sci, EE (me). The skills and the tools needed are pretty easy to pick up. Let me know if you need more pointers. I'll be more than glad to help."

ABCDesis,3an0ig,GWmyc2,2,Mon Jun 22 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"That depends on your background. If you have a stat/math background, I'd recommend starting with some R tutorials. If you have access to a library, one of the best books I've found is called Introductory Statistics with R by Peter Dalgaard.  If you have a programming background, I'd recommend starting with some statistics 101 and some R Programming to learn it with.  Then again I'm sure there are a lot of better resources compared to when I started off. Check out some courses in Coursera too. I think prof Andrew Ng of Stanford (the guy who designed the YouTube based neural net) has an intro to ML course there. A lot of my friends have very good things to say about out it.  Good luck :)"

It mainly comes down to empowering people to do amazing things and being a shield for anything negative.  I always have an itch to try something new but I do love my job!"

Decent hours 45ish. Sometimes only 40. Sometimes 50ish. Part of me feels constrained with the fact that I'm doing this. Could easily see myself living in rural India and teaching. Or doing any number of things. I just don't feel anyone's professional life can/should be tied to one thing for the next 30+ years.

I had initially planned to do my MBA or JD after undergrad, but I never thought I would be teaching at the college level and doing my own research. I've been in grad school for six years going on seven (including my M.A. in Political Science). Frankly, it's been a long road so far and it is starting to wear on me. I'm also stubborn enough to see things through, but my fucks to give are dwindling. I do it for the intellectual curiosity, work on things that will help others, and working with students. I immensely enjoy learning and helping others think critically, but a doctorate in my field has plenty of sacrifices and pitfalls to demand for the possibility (not promise) of success (i.e. getting tenure). The hardest part of the PhD is finishing the dissertation, being original in thought, and of course getting grants."

CMA isn't on that level although it's a rigorous exam in its own right. It's also more suited for cost accounting related jobs the way it was explained to me.

If you just want a companion animal, and not a show dog or working dog, why do you need a 'special' dog? Isn't that in itself a 'hipster' thing of you to do?   Moving an animal is stressful - they will have a long flight in cramped quarters and a quarantine period. Animals express their stress by getting health problems. Not worth it (for them health wise or you money wise) for an animal you have no prior bond with.   Anyways, as I said, that's my opinion. Whatever you choose to do I hope that you end up with an animal who gives you a lifetime of good memories no matter what or where the dog comes from. :)"

ABCDesis,3ajmhe,fununclebob,2,Sun Jun 21 12:28:03 2015 UTC,"The Indian Pariah Dog is a specific aboriginal landrace native to the subcontinent.   The Indian Native Dog (INDog) is an ancient autochthonous landrace of dog [...] The terms 'Indian Pariah Dog' and 'INDog' are often erroneously used to refer to all free-ranging dogs. In actual fact, most free-ranging dogs in India do not match the 'pariah type' and may not be pure indigenous dogs but mix-breeds. [...] India's Pariah Dog, the dominant village breed in plains areas, is thought to be a descendant of an early Chinese immigrant [...] Urban Indian street dogs are of Indian Pariah Dog ancestry, but usually admixed with other breeds."
ABCDesis,3ajmhe,crazygama,8,Mon Jun 22 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"You aren't a hipster by adopting a shelter pup. All dogs love the same, and you're giving one a home who otherwise wouldn't have one. You don't seem to care about genetic predispositions considering your interest in what are essentially Indian mutts, so be open to adoption. You can even be choosy about breeds and age if you want, there are rescues around the country catering to specific breeds."
ABCDesis,3ajmhe,By2Kaapi,6,Sun Jun 21 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"I've worked with rescue shelters for over three years. There are so many pets that get taken in and adopted regularly. I wonder what makes you think it's hipster. These are all not ""defective"" pets. Most are rescued from the same breeders who sell new puppies. Many more come from families who can no longer support a pet. Adopting from a shelter/rescue is certainly not a hipster thing to do. In case of pet transportation, it would come in cargo. It is known to be quite stressful for dogs. You don't have to announce to the world everytime that your pet is a rescue if such behavior by other pet owners makes you think they are hipsters :)"
ABCDesis,3ajmhe,ShereOnFire,3,Mon Jun 22 11:12:09 2015 UTC,"Just letting you know, mutts aren't always healthier. If you have two dogs with bad genetic, the product won't necessarily be better.   I agree with Scarlet_Pig, it would be much better to adopt from a shelter in your own country. That way you save a life and you ease the global problem of overflowing dog pounds.    All dogs are interesting at the end of the day, I think you should check out r/dogs and other pet related subs before you try importing one from the sub continent."
ABCDesis,3ajmhe,ziian,3,Sun Jun 21 09:46:32 2015 UTC,"If I understand it correctly, they you are talking about the stray dogs or the ones that we refer to as Desi breed? I grew up with a few of those as pets. In my personal experience, they were actually pretty health and low maintenance health wise. But apart from all the ethical, legal, logistic issues about getting them overseas, you also have to consider that most of the dogs that are available for adoption, aren't bred by some caring owners, but have been living on the streets and being shooed away and hit by people around them. So, basically they might be physically fit but can have lot of behavioral problems.   Either way, you would need to really sure before you actually get them. I do know of some people who got such dogs from India and the agency they used is called Friendicos, which is a Delhi based NGO working towards animal welfare.   Good luck getting a furry buddy from here or there!"
ABCDesis,3ajmhe,in_the_airoplane,3,Mon Jun 22 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"I have four of these mutts running around our farm house. They're definitely some of the most resilient dogs I've encountered--they're lean, low maintenance, very bright, eager to please, and all-around great dogs. I do attribute several of these factors to the care takers doing such a great job of raising them (we took on two as puppies), but they're wonderful animals.  One is an inherited stray with distemper. I keep expecting to get a call saying she's passed away because she's a bag of bones with the classic chewing bite tic indicative of neural issues... but nope. I'm convinced now that she'll outlive everyone.   I'm not sure of what it'd take to ship a dog to the US, but I remember I met someone in Nepal who befriended a stray and took it with back to the US. I was shocked at how easy it seemed. That said, Indian dogs are well-suited to Indian conditions. I'd never have a husky in Chennai any more than I'd have an Indian dog live in Vermont. So, I'd think long and hard about whether your living conditions (and lifestyle) are conducive to having a dog before jumping in."

If you want specific solutions, I personally like using serums designed to fight hyperpigmentation for dark spots and such.

I do use concealer as well, but you may or may not want to pursue that option depending on your comfort level with makeup.   /r/SkincareAddiction may be able to help you - and yes, many desis are genetically predisposed to raccoon eyes, sadly.

ABCDesis,3ab1jr,WorkReddit3420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Well I'm glad you don't use soap, haha. To start with, you want to determine your skin type. Dry, normal, oily or combination? Are you looking to prevent aging? Also, since you have facial hair, maintaining your skin after shaving or trimming your beard is important.   Also, don't discount the importance of UV protection, even computers give off light that can damage your skin. Also, UV rays can penetrate through your beard. Sun protection is also important on cloudy days.   In terms of solving dark eye eyes, I find that serums containing vitamin C extract or with AHA work best. Try to find products specific to the eye, since skin around the eyes is especially sensitive. Again, if you choose to use a serum, use sunscreen since they can often make your skin more light-sensitive.   tl;dr Wash your face with an appropriate cleanser, use an eye serum and WEAR SUNSCREEN.

He wrote a few columns about how Indians were never going to be granted commission status and that no one should voluntarily join. After a few warnings he was eventually thrown in jail, and then strapped onto a bus for Sialkot where he was forced to fight for the 15th Punjab Regiment.  He spent time in Burma and was eventually taken as a prisoner. However, for some reason, whether it was logistical or intentional, when the Japanese fell in 1945 he wasn't properly processed for release and he found himself stuck in East Asia with no method to get back.  He meddled around further East and got to the Philippines and then Malaysia where he had serve to as an indentured labourer just to make enough money to get back to what had already become Pakistan.  He eventually returned to Attock in 1950. My grandad was 13 and didn't even recognize his father, he went inside the house and told his mother that a fakeer was out by the gate."

ABCDesis,3a54gi,asdfioho,3,Wed Jun 17 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"Lyall is the name of another Briton officer, and we replaced the name with Faisalabad to represent a Saudi king. Don't really see your point."
ABCDesis,3a54gi,IzmailPirzada,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:30 2015 UTC,"I meant to say that at least to me, Campbellpur seems really obvious that it was a British officer's name to the point it's almost comical whereas Lyallpur sounded like more of a genuine Punjabi word, even though it too was a British officer's name. Maybe it's just for me considering my grandparents were from there and had proper Punjabi pronunciation of it.   I'm aware of Faisalabad being named after the Saudi King, but I am extremely confused as to why. Are other monarchs of Muslim nation-states also commemorated in Pakistan?"
ABCDesis,3a54gi,asdfioho,3,Thu Jun 18 05:32:18 2015 UTC,"I get you now, and yeah Lyallpur does sound like a legitimate Punjabi lafs. But even Campbellpur becomes Cammullpoor and it sounds just as native to me.  Faisalabad is just an example of when Zulfikhar Bhutto was PM. He leaned heavily towards Islamic unity, and so he had a hard-on for other contemporary Muslim leaders, often inviting them for conferences. Another example is the country's main cricket staidum being named after Ghaddafi."

ABCDesis,3a54gi,book-of-kells,4,Wed Jun 17 10:58:18 2015 UTC,"My grandfather was in the Army during WWII.  I feel like it's a story that people don't want to hear, particularly among Bengalis, with their Netaji worship. Basically ""helping the British = bad"" and almost traitorous, whereas opposing the British during WWII to extent to collaborating with Nazis is supposedly good.  EDIT: Fine my grandfather sucks, you have me."
ABCDesis,3a54gi,serenissima_regina,8,Thu Jun 18 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"First of all Netaji is not only popular among Bengalis. Yes his popularity among the Bengali populous was because he was a son of the soil to them. But Netaji's popularity among the Indian population is quite far reaching. I have seen his anniversary celebrated with vigor in Tamil Nadu, from where a big portion of his soldiers in the INA came. He was the biggest alternative to the section of society who were disillusioned with Mahatma Gandhi's approach to the freedom struggle.  One more reason why fighting for the British was considered a great evil was the way they behaved after WWI, they made the promise of Home Rule when the war was over. Indian population actively supported the British during WWI, many Indians signed up for the British Army voluntarily, but after the war was over the British went back on their word and within a year managed to commit the Jallianwalabagh Massacre.  I know the concept of good and bad is defined differently in the west compared to that in India or any other country that was colonized. In the west the Nazis were the bad guys who wanted to destroy the world and the allied forces were the good guys hell bent on saving the world, even though Britain and France were two of the biggest colonial masters in the world. In the colonized countries for most of its people their colonial masters were the evil and they have every right to feel that way.   Imo from pov of the colonies the WWII was basically a fight between Godzilla and Mothra. Didn't matter who was good or bad, anybody in the action zone was gonna get crushed."
ABCDesis,3a54gi,Desi_Wolverine,3,Fri Jun 19 09:15:43 2015 UTC,Small anecdote: my dad had a colleague from Andhra Pradesh who was named Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Rao by his dad who had served in the INA.  Apparently a lot of people from his generation had variants of that name in his village.
ABCDesis,3a54gi,book-of-kells,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"Netaji was quite an awful person in any case. Did you read about what happened in the Andamans? None of the other freedom fighters have such a record to their name. Anyway, in my family we quite despise Netaji."
ABCDesis,3a54gi,Desi_Wolverine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yes Netaji was an awful person for taking a stand against the colonial masters instead of sucking up to them. There were no good and evil in the world war. Everyone fought for their own selfish reason, Netaji fought to get the British out of India and for the right to self govern, he just didn't care which path he took. Netaji is a polarizing character, loved by many despised by some, especially the communist party of India, who called him Tojo's dog, for aligning with Japan. Btw this the same Communist Party that supported the Chinese Invasion of India and even acted as informants. Everybody has blood on their hands, no point in sugar-coating it."

Try seeing millions of your fellow Bengalis die due to famine caused by wilful negligence on the part of your imperial overlords and continue to support the British.  The Nazis were monsters but the British weren't angels either.  And it was the latter's war-crimes that directly affected Bengalis.

I am genuinely sorry that you are having hard time connecting with mom and want to do right by her. It's hard for some parents to accept that some girls don't like to doll up. Maybe your mom is overly proud of you and want you to be a typical girl and expect you to do girl things which you don't prefer. That is totally understandable. Maybe your mom is in complete denial of something.   Perhaps, you could see if you can have a family conversation with sister and dad in presence and come to an understanding.   Since you mentioned that your parents are fairly liberal compared to other family. I am sure there's a possibility to talk it out.   Or if that isn't a solution that you think may work, try to doll up and appease her a bit? Maybe this may ease her worries. It's a compromise and maybe not be too stubborn about it?

You're trying to be straightforward with her and it's strange how she closes off the possibility of frank communication so quickly.   Sadly, your situation reminded me more of, more broadly, of how limited for some the 'expressions' of femininity are. For some reason as a Indian girl, this has especially been noticeable in simple comments about hair, dressing, social demeanor, and I've even heard comments on body language from both fathers and mothers pleading, ""Girls don't behave like that... Girls don't wear things like that... Girls should take an interest in ..."".

Ummm, nope, I'm not, but thanks for that anyway dad. I've since grown my hair longer, and my mom says I finally look like her daughter. Jeez, thanks.  Anyway--I really don't have a solution to this. Desi parents are obsessed with their self image, reputation amongst the community, and just want you to marry into a nice desi family.

You're her daughter. She was essentially saying ""unless you wear these earrings, you will not be acceptable to me as my daughter"". That's a pretty huge blow in terms of being loved.

I love to travel, eat and drink coffee/milk tea   What's your favorite coffee shop in Seattle and why is it Espresso Vivace?"
ABCDesis,3a1mnz,chai_and_milktea,3,Tue Jun 16 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"Gasp, another Seattleite! Perhaps we have crossed paths without even knowing it! I hope you have good memories of your ex (I'm a good person, I swear)?  hahaha I like your taste in coffee! YES, Vivace is one of my favorites - although I'm usually a drinker of plain, iced lattes, their Cafe Nico is my obsession.  Also a huge fan of Slate."
ABCDesis,3a1mnz,analystdude,3,Tue Jun 16 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"OMG! Cafe Nico is most definitely my all time favorite coffee. There was a time when my wife and I went there every Sunday just to have Cafe Nico.  If you haven't been there already, I also really love Bauhaus in Cap Hill. I just dig their ambiance.  As for my ex, we continued to be very good friends until we both started dating others. No grudges, whatsoever.  If you live around SLU area and hang out at bars/cafes in Cap Hill, I'm pretty sure we might've run into each other at least once. My ex was also very active in NAAP Seattle and we used to go to a lot of NAAP meetups, if you were involved in NAAP we most definitely have run into each other!"
ABCDesis,3a1mnz,chai_and_milktea,3,Tue Jun 16 21:54:08 2015 UTC,"YES! Iced AND hot Cafe Nicos give me life. I tried Bauhaus on Cap Hill once in December, I love the ambiance there as well. Storyville (the one on the 2nd floor in Pike Place Market) and Ada's also have a thumbs up from me :)  Interesting! I actually only moved to Seattle a couple of years ago (from the bay area <-- original, I know) so I haven't been as involved in the community as much as I'd like, other than work. How's the NAAP up here?"
ABCDesis,3a1mnz,analystdude,2,Tue Jun 16 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to Ada's. Storyville is a thumbs up from me as well. Your tastes seem very similar to mine, so I'll most def check out Ada's.  Admittedly, I haven't gone to any of the NAAAP events in over 3 years, but I see updates from my Facebook friends who're still active. From my experience, I'd say there's always at least one event per month organized by NAAAP. Meetups, volunteering events, etc.  I've lost a lot of my friends to the bay area, so this (Bay Area --> Seattle) is a welcome change coz I'm not part of the  California transplant hater club. I work in the tech industry (gaming specifically) so there's a lot of movement between bay area and Seattle and I see that as the norm."

I can't believe this, but I think I'll be buying my first 6th-gen system soon now that FFVII is getting remade.  None of these modern RPGs I've played since FFX and Radiant Historia came close to impacting me as much as FFVII. Even after 18 years, its entire story (from its atmosphere to its cast of characters) stands out as one of the best to have ever graced a video game. It's a shame that FF fans had to suffer through a miserable spate of Final Fantasies before Square finally decided to gift them with a remake of this masterpiece.  This game and the new Zelda for the Wii U....lord have mercy on me should both of these games come out at the same time.

I find it slightly absurd since I don't know the rules and the finer nuances like I know in soccer, for example.   Oh man! We are very similar, you and I. I used to watch and play soccer in middle school and high school. I still follow tennis (but only the grand slams). But once I started following football (~5 years ago) it quickly became my favorite sport. It also helps that we currently have the best team (Seahawks, FTW) but when I started watching football, our team was in a transitional phase and sucked donkey balls, but hey your team is your team.  Anyway, on to the point - just start watching games with your friends. If you don't understand something, ask them. I've had a lot of my friends from India start watching football with me and they all ended up loving the game. I guess knowing just the basics help. Here's NFL.com's beginner's guide.  Since you're in St. Louis, it's going to be extra fun. Rams are always fucking shit up in NFC West. They're an exciting team. Last season they did this against Seahawks.

My question for you is: How do you take an idea and turn it into the script for an entire episode? Do you have a writing team, or do you do most of the writing yourself?  Thanks!"
ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,6,Mon Jun 15 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"It's just me. And it's hard. Writing is the part of the process that I really love, and I practiced and studied it quite thoroughly for a while before coming up with the script. It's a formulaic process, so I threw away a lot of ideas before settling on something I liked."

If it's okay, I'll ask a part two to my question then: Once you're done with the script, do you have a group of people you show it to/bounce it off to see what gets laughs?

ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,6,Mon Jun 15 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question! I actually only bounced the script off a non-Desi writer friend.

What sort of reactions did you get from your parents, friends (both Desi and non-Desi) and the aunties? What are some of the projects you're working on now and what can we look forward to from you?   As an aside, cheese to a party is ALWAYS welcome."
ABCDesis,39y2gl,analystdude,6,Mon Jun 15 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for having me!    I haven't entirely shifted away from my traditional background. I still engineer for money. And oddly enough, it was while at a typical cubical engineering job that I started to learn screenwriting.  When I first introduced the idea to make a webseries to my parents, I asked ""How would you feel about me moving home and filming a webseries at the house?"" Protip: Always introduce things with ""me moving home,"" they won't hear past that. We're all at a place where we're just happy to be around each other and see each other happy, so they were excited for me at first, although worried at times, as most parents are. The aunties LOVED it! Once they saw it on YouTube they were just excited to be involved.  Now, I'm trying to do more writing, and getting in the network/writer mix."

ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,5,Mon Jun 15 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for having me! I set out wanting to make a sitcom, and thought it would be really fun to have a family that looked like my own. I think I really learned a lot about 'being American,' from watching sitcoms as a kid, and thought it would be fun to flip the script a little. So I just tried to tell a personal story in a traditional, family style sitcom format."
ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,4,Mon Jun 15 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"So I just tried to tell a personal story in a traditional, family style sitcom format.   And that's exactly the vibe I got from the series. It's basically presenting the everyday lives of South Asian Americans through humor. I'm pretty sure every single one of us here can relate to at least one incident from your web series.  I'm not familiar with JusReign or PlanetParle, but I've seen SuperWoman's work. Hers is usually just over the top desi humor - which is also something I enjoy.   The one where her parents were grilling a boy she brought home was really hilarious, but your series seems a bit more 'realistic' if you know what I mean. These are things I can actually see happening in desi households."
ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,6,Mon Jun 15 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"I love SuperWoman too. It's so interesting all the different styles of entertainment you can see on the web. I'm old school and went the sitcom route, but her format fascinates me. I'm excited to see where the web is going to take us in terms of entertainment."
ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,4,Mon Jun 15 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Do you hope to have other youtube personalities, not limited to just the ones mentioned, to make appearances in your sitcom-style approach? Perhaps to allow you to then tap into a already established audience?"
ABCDesis,39y2gl,CisternaChyli,3,Mon Jun 15 19:39:56 2015 UTC,I would love to going forward. I would have loved to if I had the resources at the time.

For one thing it was mainly restructuring, so the majority of those 250 employees got positions elsewhere within Disney. For another, a contract for a large project went to a 3rd party consulting company which predominantly had H-1B staff in their team. And lastly, training the new people did not refer to training them in programming skills but rather training them about the business rules (standard practice in any employee transitioning situation).  So, while I am sure there's some level of abuse in the H-1B system, I don't think it's a black and white situation here."

It's not that bad in the real world. These two sets of people don't often intersect or if they did, they stay polite to each other.  As far as I know senators Chuck Grassley and Jeff Sessions have always been opposed to skilled worker immigration reforms/improvements. Nothing new there too. They are just grinding their old axes.  To be fair there is some h1B fraud going on especially in the US based IT consultancy shops. Most of it is to avoid deportation when you are unemployed for an extended period of time."

ABCDesis,39u8tg,book-of-kells,9,Mon Jun 15 00:32:27 2015 UTC,Desis still face extreme discrimation and racism in America on account of having brown skin. Islamophobic crimes are on the rise and Hindus and sikhs are attacked too because they are mistaken for muslim. And the UK/Europe is even worse.

ABCDesis,39u8tg,sindibindi,2,Mon Jun 15 12:20:57 2015 UTC,Obviously the black community has it worse because they've been here longer. Every minority struggles in their own way
ABCDesis,39u8tg,kinsho,2,Mon Jun 15 10:19:57 2015 UTC,"The one picture you've posted isn't very illustrative of cultural appropriation, but generally speaking yeah."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,sindibindi,-7,Sun Jun 14 21:26:11 2015 UTC,Cultural appropriation by definition occurs between marginalized society and a dominant society.   Indians are not marginalized.
ABCDesis,39u8tg,kinsho,12,Sun Jun 14 23:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we are marginalized.  The persistence of negative stereotypes, the racial bias that hurt us in various industries where we don't have much of a presence, the fact that a huge number of people in this country still consider us inferior in some way (given the backlash that followed after Nina Davaluri won Miss America).....we still got quite a ways to go in this country."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,book-of-kells,-7,Mon Jun 15 00:16:09 2015 UTC,By your standards every ethnic group could consider itself marginalized.   The backlash after Nina Davaluri was not that she was inferior - it was that she was not considered 'American'.  The only way Indians are considered 'inferior' is that they have a brown skin. Not much else.
ABCDesis,39u8tg,kinsho,4,Mon Jun 15 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"Read between the lines of what you just wrote - why is Nina not good enough to be an American? Perhaps is it because of her skin color and her faithfulness to her roots?  And your first point is just silly. Even by my standards, some ethnic groups stay away from being marginalized, like the Irish, Italians, Germans, etc."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,book-of-kells,3,Mon Jun 15 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"Is there systematic institutional discrimination against Indians, though? I would say that is what makes a group marginalized.   Like in my country, black people and Muslims are institutionally discriminated against. Meaning rejected for job applications based on their names, or being told in primary school that they shouldn't bother with the university track, it's above their abilities (even though their score on the final test tells them they are suited for gymnasium). They are also subject to anti-immigrant rhetoric by politicians (mostly Muslims).  Indians, however, are not marginalized in my country - though we are very few. Everybody assumes that Indians are very intelligent. Everyone goes on about the 'ancient culture' and spirituality and the amazing food and whatnot. We don't face the kind of discrimination that other groups do. We also don't face anti-immigrant sentiments as almost everybody assumes Indians to be highly educated white collar workers such as accountants or engineers."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,kinsho,2,Mon Jun 15 06:07:01 2015 UTC,"Indians do face some discrimination here in America, albeit to a much lesser extent compared to blacks and Latinos. But just because other groups are far more marginalized does not negate the fact that we remain marginalized to an extent.    For one thing, if you look at the experiences of desis trying to break into liberal Hollywood or any other entertainment medium, you'll hear tales of continued discrimination over and over again. Quite a few had to anglicize their names to try to work around the issue. Look at Kal Penn or Aarti Mann."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,book-of-kells,2,Mon Jun 15 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"I think Indians in US are marginalized more because people are ignorant and think that all brown people are terrorists. South Asians in the UK don't seem to Anglicize their names to make it in the media world, look at Meera Syal or Sanjeev Bhaskar, to name just two.   Right-wing groups in Europe are more insidious, favouring Indians and East Asians as 'good immigrants' and labelling Muslim immigrants from Turkey and North Africa, and from portions of Africa as 'bad immigrants'. Although a striking difference between USA is that Eastern European immigrants are discriminated against a lot in Western Europe as well. I don't know if I can label them as 'marginalized' though because I don't know if they are systematically denied opportunities like other groups."
ABCDesis,39u8tg,sindibindi,2,Mon Jun 15 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"I think people here are generally cognizant that India =/= the Middle East, so not all brown folks are terrorists.  Desis do get the 'good little minority' label here too, but that label's been taking a little beating lately, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it was for the right reasons. It's largely as a result of our own bad actions. A sizable number of Desis (not just men) harbor attitudes that are just downright backwards when it comes to things like a woman's role in society and caste. Too many brown men are fucking perverts.   But perhaps worst of all.....perhaps worst of all....desis in general are sheltered and deliberately forced down certain ways of thinking that tends to shrink their range of thought and rob them of any creative/adventurous inkling. For every brown artist or inventor, you'll have a dozen average doctors/engineers. To me, it's anything but shocking that we dominate the spelling bee, a competition testing only rote memorization and not much else. As a result, a stereotype that persistently hounds us time and time again are that desis, while intelligent, are lacking in terms of skills that fall outside STEM fields. You don't see Jewish people get hit with this shit, but you will see desis get hit by this.  And yes, I know there are Indians in film, TV, journalism, writing, art, music, design, etc. I know that shit already. This subreddit regularly goes out its way to highlight Indians doing interesting things. But the vast majority of us are either mundane analysts or working with little fanfare in STEM fields. We need to expand outward more.  EDIT: Whoa...sorry for the rant. That was kind of unexpected."

Then I heard a podcast interview with Matt Mullenweg (founder of wordpress), where he mentioned offhand that he uses it religiously when traveling, so i gave it another look.  been doing it 5-7 times a week for the last month. down 5lbs (212lbs to 207) in that time with no dietary changes (yet). Though I do tend to find that any exercise tends to suppress my appetite somewhat, so there's that. and with it taking only 7 minutes, i do it right when i wake up in the morning and then shower.

ABCDesis,39r2ov,Jirni,2,Sun Jun 14 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"I like my current workout routine and diet, but I'm pretty sure that I won't be able to keep it up at all during my 3-week vacation in India. I need some advice, folks."
ABCDesis,39r2ov,higeo,3,Sun Jun 14 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"I should preface that I'm answering this in the way I am because it's hard for me to decided if you can't keep it up because of the routine itself or because of motivation. On the off chance that it's the routine, my answer makes a world more sense. If it's motivation... I tend to get mine from reminding myself in a mental mantra of all the things my good health affords me to be able to do. Music also. As cheese filled as it may sound, find that one thing that you would drive off a cliff for, and either picture it mentally, or go so far as to carry a snap of it with you. Whenever something sneaks up on you like an auntie with a ghee laden dish telling you that you're so very skinny, eat! Or you think today walking around in the areas you are is good enough (and sometimes, it really SHOULD be, don't beat yourself up if you're not rocking out the Krishh workout of jumping tree tops and springing over mountain cliffs today), take that image out and really focus on it for however long it needs to get you going. Cliche it may be, but: If it's important, you'll find a way. If it's not... you'll find an excuse. You got this, home, India, it doesn't matter, you totally got this!  Okay, granted, I have no idea what your routine consists of, but no matter what it is, when it comes to travelling, the same thing that should apply to what you pack, applies to your workouts; K.I.S.S. So I'm going to give you some really quick ways to ""Keep it simple"" in the comfort of your room.  Cardio and strength can be done any place at any time. Lets say for the sake of argument that you are hesitant to take a morning jog, that's fine and easy to replace. Remember, cardio is only about getting your heart rate up to a certain degree and then keeping it there for however long you need it to be. Since you're travelling and probably pressed for time, aim for a H(igh) (I)ntensity (I)nterval (T)raining routine of 15-20 minutes (though please feel free to go above and beyond if you find the time!)   Things to string together would be: jumping jacks, bodyweight squats, high knees, mountain climbers, planks, side (full extension) or front (knee raise) kicks, burpees, speed bag punches (at the air, not quite as exciting as it sounds... sorry), etc etc The list is very nearly endless. Just think about all that ""crap"" the gym teachers used to make us do in school for ""warm ups"" and then crack it up to the nth degree! Jumping jacks are easy! So now make them not easy. Do them for 20 seconds without stopping. Then stop. Then INSTANTLY start doing 20 seconds worth of burpees. Then stop. And so on.   Realistically, you can take any of those things I listed, put them into a set of four and do as I said for 10 full sets. If you're not out of breath and your heart rate up, you know that you need to add more.    Now, for strength, you don't have to worry there either. While it's not the weight room by any stretch, it's still going to help tone and build. Sets and reps are up to you and your needs, everyone is different which is why I hesitate to give you the numbers I would do for myself!  For chest: Incline push ups, normal pushups, dips, push to side planks.  For abs: Sit ups/crunches, reverse crunches, modified bicycles, planks.  For arms: Find something semi heavy (enough for you and your goals) and use it to do a reverse curl as you would if you had a weight plate. Cobra tri extensions, farmer's walk.  For legs: Burpee, floor glute-ham raise, mountain climbers, squats, lunges, flutter kicks  For back: Australian Pull ups (this assumes you don't have a bar up high, if you do, normal pull ups and chin ups are ""better""), supermans  For shoulders: If you want to get real crazy, handstand push ups against a wall are great for making you feel like you're a naughty little kid marking up the wall with your feet! Life is short, get amusement where you can, I always say.  I know people are going to be shoving fatty things in your mouth, and diets go boom very easy, but if it's something that's important to you, you can be firm about it while being polite. Try to keep mental tabs on what you are eating and if you have a limit, don't feel bad for sticking to that. It's your body and you have to live with it, not them. If it's not a matter of people force feeding you and just a problem with options out and about, take along some snacks (almost typed in snakes, feel free to pack snakes too, it's a crowd pleaser), that fit whatever diet or plan you follow. A lot of fruits and nuts are easy to take along for whatever and can help combat your hunger enough that you don't make a choice you regret later when passing by that amazing smelling road side stand.   I hope I've been in some way helpful. If not, my very sincere apologies x_X"
ABCDesis,39r2ov,Jirni,2,Sun Jun 14 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"To answer your preface, it actually has to do with both the routine itself as well as the motivation. I knew that my greatest weakness in my workout routine was my lack of adaptability. I just couldn't find the right way to admit that.  That being said, your advice gave me enough motivation to take your suggestions to heart and incorporate them into my plans for my workout routine during my vacation in India. Trying to be polite but firm when it comes to food is going to be difficult, but it's something that I'll have to do.  Thank you, I think this really will help me."

Check out a blog called Peanut Butter and Protein. It has a lot of recipes if just straight shake isn't your thing.   If you're trying to use it as a gainer, try adding in various things. I'm obsessed with Nuts N More as well as things like pitted dates? Good for additional calories (and fat) if that's something you are looking for.  My personal favourite shake combo (as a gainer, not for someone looking to slim down) is 1 banana, almond butter, pitted dates, spinach, vanilla protein, coconut water, cinnamon  and a good helping of ice.

ABCDesis,39o8od,VSindhicate,4,Sun Jun 14 07:31:50 2015 UTC,"Like other people said in this thread, there's two sides to this. I'm going to give my personal experience as a Sikh who knows many such Sikh camps and attended some, and I think these translate pretty well to Hindus and Muslims as well. IMO, there's nothing inherently wrong in camps to teach kids about the faith; for Sikh camps, while there were general multipurpose camps, there were also camps structured around workshops, some being Sikh conferences over a couple days in the summer to discuss a specific pre-determined topic, others being workshops on Sikh musicology, and training in Sikh warfare (gatka). I attended one on musicology, and since we were pretty strictly limited to our daily meditation, fun time for us kids, and music practice, there was absolutely no political ideology being espoused. The reason camps were so fun was that you get a concentrated way to learn something about your faith and you get to hang out with friends with a similar background and lifestyle to your own, and learn a lot that way.   I really want to attend the gatka camps, but never got a chance to. I found out that after all the physical training, they do a workshop on Sikh history and how warfare's played a role therein. I expected them to do a general overview of Sikh history and warfare until the present, which would probably also include the Sikh militancy against the Indian govt. However, I've heard from friends the whole workshop solely talks about 1984 and uses that as a seg-way for what's pretty much Khalistani indoctrination (and this happens in some of the general purpose camps, many of which are apolitical and just for fun, but some of which are specifically constructed for this purpose). I don't use that strong word lightly, as someone who is all to wary of how many Indian and Hindutva nationalist blocs label any form of Sikh activism as Khalistani campaigning funded by the Pakistani ISI. I mean, 1984 is something that a lot of people experienced and doesn't necessarily need an expert so much as perhaps discussion-based learning. However, it was only one guy giving a fiery speech about how we need to honor the shaheeds properly, how the Indian government is responsible for making Sikhs weak and not willing for Khalistan today, how all the negative things attributed to some militants was propaganda, etc.. It was quite literally propaganda. I know a kid whose grandfather served in the military at the time of 1984, got a quite nice pension for his service and was able to use it to live abroad, and wasn't really negatively affected by anything that happened to Sikhs back then because he was a rich professional Sikh in the elite, residing in Delhi. Ironically, preachers along the lines of Bhindranwale used to criticize people exactly like him for being complicit in the treatment of their Sikh brethren. He once told me that he could have mutinied against India in his unit but chose not to and chose to stay united to them. Anyways, so this kid goes to camp knowing absolutely nothing about 1984. Comes back, starts periodically posting pics of the shaheeds (martyrs) on facebook with captions talking about how we need to honor them, Khalistan Zindabad, all this other shit. He also started posting a lot of shit about Jatt pride (ironic cuz he's not even Jatt) which makes sense given how tied in it is to Khalistan in general nowadays. I have a conversation with him about 1984, and he tells me ""yeah, India is a shithole, that's why my grandparents ran the fuck out of it cuz they were getting persecuted."" He's been taken along the propaganda ride so hard that he has started fabricating his own identity and his own family history. It's absolutely terrible. in honesty I'm no fan of India (or Khalistan for that matter) and I generally support the militants' cause. However, I think you should form your debates on open debate, logical discourse, reading rigorous books on the matter, not just listen to what some counselor rattled off in a camp while all the kids were busy admiring him.   I think these experiences translate to what the article is saying, it's not being anti-Hindu or even anti-Hindu-camps, just being wary of what certain camps do with the opportunity to have a group of kids not really in the mood to question authority or critically think for a week. Unless you feel my analysis was ""anti-Sikh,"" in which case I don't know what to say."
ABCDesis,39o8od,Hot4_TeaCha,5,Mon Jun 15 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"I attended one of the HSS Shakha camps as a kid. My parents are fairly liberal, but didn't know much about it other than it was a Hindu/Indian cultural thing, and I was always interested in culture and religion, so they sent me. I was really young at the time so I don't remember much, but what I do remember is:  1) the experience for me, as a kid, was mostly just summer camp with other Indians, which was fun and cool. I was one of the youngest kids there (I was 9 and most everyone else was in their teens), so I became like a cute little brother to a lot of people.   2) The classes/workshops had a seriously nationalist tone - I still remember being taught a very one-sided story about the violent atrocities committed by Muslim invaders in India... and since I obviously didn't learn much Indian history in US public schools, a lot of those ideas were not corrected until I got to college and really started looking at the issues.   3) The setup was definitely ""militarily influenced,"" in the sense that every morning began with standing at attention, marching a bit, and other disciplined patriotic mumbo-jumbo. At the time I thought of it like a stricter version of Boy Scouts.  I was also very involved in HSC (Hindu Students Council - not HSS) in college, and even served as president of our college's chapter. I will agree that it has become, at least at the local level, a pretty independent organization. We mostly did what we wanted to do within our college group. There was really only one event during the entire time I was at college when we interacted with the larger HSC organization, through a retreat with a few nearby colleges. The retreat, however, did leave me and a number of other people with a bad taste about the larger organization, since it was a lot more focused on political Hindu identity/Hindutva bullshit than on the spiritual practice of Hinduism. After that, I probably would have pushed to formally detach our college group from the HSC (and change the name to HSA or something generic like that), but I was graduating within a few months, so I left it up to the following generations.  EDIT: As a more direct response to the article, I like it overall, but I am not sure why the author thinks Prashad's decision to look at Hindu camps was somehow a failure of research. A scholar cannot research and write about EVERYTHING, and Prashad's books The Karma of Brown Folk and Uncle Swami are deeply concerned with discussing the effects of globalization and diaspora on Hindu nationalism. In that context, it makes sense to look at Hindu youth camps. While Sikh/Muslim camps would have made for an interesting comparison, that is really a separate project beyond the scope of what Prashad discussed in his books."

Indians in the U.S. all have highly variable levels of education, experience, and identification with their cultural and religious backgrounds. They're also not necessarily soaked in the culture through mass media and pop-culture. That's what makes that hand-wave halfway functional when we apply it to White men (but it's a fair facile argument in that context too TBH) but it's simply not an analogous situation in India and especially not among the diaspora, so the narrative simply doesn't work."
ABCDesis,39o8od,wiigamer136,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by your response, although I strongly suspect that you haven't actually read Prashad's work, and are merely spouting off against what you imagine to be his agenda. If you have read it, I would request you to help me understand how a discussion of Muslim and Sikh campus would, in any way, ""contradict his narrative."" He never enters a discussion of Hinduism vs. Sikhism vs. Islam; be is taking about the link between Indian diaspora and Hindu extremism. In fact, I would suspect that he would have similar criticisms of other religious camps since he is pretty anti-religion in general (I disagree with him there, but that's a separate issue). Either way, you seem to have assumed that Prashad is somehow attempting to attack Hinduism and defend Islam, when there is really no indication in his work of this ""agenda."""
ABCDesis,39o8od,VSindhicate,4,Sun Jun 14 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"I've read mass publication articles he has written, though not anything of his that's peer reviewed.   And I don't think he's trying to defend Islam, but he does certainly have an ax to grind against Hinduism, and part of that narrative involves casting any Hindu association or group as being either secretly fascist themselves or useful idiots for Hindu fascism.   There need be no X vs Y vs Z, but he will certainly trot out every incidence of communal violence led by Hindu mobs with no context whatsoever to soften it while similar incidences from other groups will be simply glossed over. It contradicts his narrative because he wants us to believe that India has a Hindutva problem that leads to this violence rather than a broader law-and-order or religion/state interaction problem."
ABCDesis,39o8od,alwaysLearning1984,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"part of that narrative involves casting any Hindu association or group as being either secretly fascist themselves or useful idiots for Hindu fascism.   I think that's taking it a bit far. As I remarked earlier, he is pretty anti-religion, but I don't think it's fair to suggest that he targets any and every Hindu organization. He has specifically targeted VHP, VHPA, HSS, and HSC, and has given reasonably good arguments for why those organizations are problematic. Although as I mentioned in my original comment, HSC is dispersed through so many college campuses that the local chapters often have little or no connection to the ideology or various political agendas that the parent organization may have."
ABCDesis,39o8od,ShereOnFire,2,Mon Jun 15 00:32:47 2015 UTC,Any group that's large enough is going to have some contact with some element of the VHP or the Sangh Parivar. That's simply a fact of being a big tent and interacting with people from many parts of an ideological spectrum. Suggesting that the mere fact of association makes one problematic is really silly. Nobody would ever engage in any associative group if that was the standard.
ABCDesis,39o8od,deepicasso,-4,Sun Jun 14 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight! On a related note, have you watched ""India's Daughter""? It's an excellent documentary about womanhood in India, and it touches on VHP Durga Vahini military-style camps for women in India. I think you might enjoy it.     The retreat, however, did leave me and a number of other people with a bad taste about the larger organization, since it was a lot more focused on political Hindu identity/Hindutva bullshit than on the spiritual practice of Hinduism.     But groups like the HSS and the VHP are Hindutva groups. My main beef with groups like them (no pun intended) is that they are exploiting the sentiments of a diaspora wishing to connect with their home culture/country for their own political gain. They know full well if they explicitly talked about Hindutva out of the gate, then Indian-Americans / second-generation folks would immediately reject them. We are too cosmopolitan and educated to tack ourselves onto an intolerant, right-wing ideology. It's their willingness to espouse Hindutva ideology under the guise of ""teaching kids about their heritage"" that really grinds my gears."
ABCDesis,39o8od,deepicasso,7,Sat Jun 13 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"But groups like the HSS and the VHP are Hindutva groups.    Well, I know this now - but what I was trying to say was that, in college, neither myself or any of the other members of our college HSC had any idea that the bigger HSC organization had any connection with VHP at all. That retreat was where we started to get an idea, and it really put a lot of us off.  That documentary looks like it's worth watching (although I might not ""enjoy"" it as much as feel really sick watching it). I totally agree with your point about extremist groups exploiting the fact that Indian parents feel distanced from their culture. I'm also really surprised that you're being downvoted since you made your point fairly without any inappropriate or hateful remarks, which makes me worry that this thread is being brigaded."

ABCDesis,39kcm6,Hot4_TeaCha,23,Fri Jun 12 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"My first ever job as a teenager was at Dunkin' Donuts (a popular coffee & donut chain in the eastern U.S.).  One of my coworkers was a man in his 40s from Egypt, and didn't speak much English.  This man was amazing.  In the morning rush, when there would be people lined up all the way to the doors, he would call out for orders at least 5-6 people back while working on his current orders.  And he'd remember every single one with near perfect recall.  I was in awe of this man.  One day I asked about his background.  In his broken English he explained that he'd had his own engineering firm in Egypt and was actually doing well, but even with the money he felt his kids would have a better life in the U.S.  His lack of English was a problem, so he was working at the Dunkin' Donuts--sometimes sleeping in the back room between a night shift and the next morning's shift--while he was trying to work on his English and get on his feet here.  Now, maybe some of those details were fibs or maybe not, but regardless this was a very intelligent, hardworking, and ambitious man who was trying to do right by his family.  I had so much respect for him.  But as I looked across the counter at the people ordering from him, sometimes in a rude and condescending manner, I could tell that they heard his broken English and immediately judged him as no one worth respecting.  Pissed me the hell off, and I really had to hold back sometimes.    But let's be honest: no one judges people for poor English skills more harshly than Desis judge each other for it.  Americans may look down on you, but I've watched plenty of Desis who consider themselves more ""sophisticated"" treat Desis with poor English skills with derision and sometimes even contempt.  It's even worse than how those customers behaved toward my Egyptian coworker at Dunkin' Donuts IMO."

There's evidence that very high consumption of animal products is linked to cardiovascular disease. What the evidence doesn't show is if eliminating animal products yields a benefit. The initial study did not show a correlation between animal protein intake and cancer, but somehow the author of the book assumes there is one.  The other thing to be careful the study is that all the participants were of one particular ethnic subgroup, and they 1980s rural China is drastically different in lifestyle to here.  I would refer you to the papers from Nurses' Health Study and the Framingham Heart Study for a better study design, more representative sample, and clearer conclusions.  Basically you should eat whatever makes you comfortable, but I'm very troubled by people like Campbell spreading misinformation. The way I see it, eliminating animal products because of ethical concerns or personal taste or food sensitivity is legitimate in itself - twisting science data to support a personal choice is not warranted."

If you mess with plants at night, not only do you run the risk of grabbing thorns or mistakenly grabbing something poisonous, but you also might end up disturbing bird nests or spiderwebs, or worse, disturbing something dangerous like a snake or diseased small animal (especially problematic in India). Making a mistake like this is easy in the dark, but if you caution some macho foolhardy person, they may disregard your warning. However, if told to avoid disturbing plants out of consideration (something that also aligns with traditional Hindu thought), they may be more inclined to listen.

In illustrated books about Sikh history, most of the Sikhs in battle or being martyred are depicted with a light skin tone that's either typical for most Punjabis, or if anything lighter. However, the Mughals and Pathans carrying out the tortures are ALWAYS painted with what may be perceived as uglier faces and relatively much darker.

The second interview is a wild success that ends in (I'm not making this up) high fives and an on the spot offer.

ABCDesis,39hn3z,flamegrl13,3,Thu Jun 11 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought blue skin is a euphemism for dark-skinned people of Aryan ethnicity. Dark-skinned people of Dravidian origin were referred to as black-skinned Asuras, Rakshasas and the like."
ABCDesis,39hn3z,flamegrl13,3,Thu Jun 11 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"There aren't many blue-skin characters in Indian mythology and the ones there are mostly of Vishnu's avatars. Most of these mythological art is subject to the artist's creative freedom. Karna, Krishna both are of Aryan ethnicity if you believe the Aryan invasion theory, both are said to be dark skinned. And don't think all Asuaras are portrayed as South Indian, don't know how many people know this but the most famous Asura of all time Ravana was in fact a North Indian, born in brought up in modern day Uttar Pradesh. He settled in Lanka after dethroning the ruler of Lanka Kuber. And not all Asuras are bad, look at Bhakt Prahalada, he is one of the most endearing and noble characters in Indian mythology was born a Asura. Indian mythology is very interesting and meaningful should it be read objectively."
ABCDesis,39hn3z,flamegrl13,0,Fri Jun 12 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"That's fair, the blue skin part.   You don't have to believe in Aryan invasion theory. I don't because I follow historical developments closely. Aryans were an ethnic group and identified themselves distinctly from Dravidians, who were overwhelmingly darker-skinned, based on Vedic references.   Ravana's story is very fascinating to me because he was a half-blood or bi-ethnic. His father was an Aryan-origin rishi and a respected figure but he fell in love with an Asura woman and they lived together for some time. He didn't marry her, however, because she was Asura (possibly referring to her Dravidian origin) and after some time, she left him to return to her home. Ravana grew up in an Aryan home, learned according to Aryan brahmin traditions but grew up to be a warrior. He then led claim to Lanka's throne as an Asura-origin warrior in a Lanka ruled by Yaksha-origin Kuber. Yaksha, Asura, Rakshasa were all different kinds of people who were categorized as Dasyu in early Vedic texts but developed distinct identities in later Aryan texts. Kuber went on to become an Aryan demi-god from an evil Yaksha chief in Vedic-era texts.  One of Bhakt Prahlada's redeeming qualities was that he believed in Aryan gods and traditions as opposed to those of Asuras. Naturally, he was supposed to be noble primarily based on that 'virtue' as well as his other truly good deeds.  Indian mythology is fascinating to me too, from both a historical as well as literary viewpoint, but objective reading would mean looking at legends more critically than simply believing in their literal word or accepting the modern right-wing or Marxist interpretation."
ABCDesis,39hn3z,JenniferHewitt,3,Fri Jun 12 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"Aryans were an ethnic group and identified themselves distinctly from Dravidians, who were overwhelmingly darker-skinned, based on Vedic references.   Source?  The most recent theories posit two waves of migration happening at the same time following climactic changes in the Indian subcontinent. The first is the movement of a few bands of Central Asian steppe herders from desertifying Central Asia into the new fresh pasture in Pakistani river basins, and the second is the movement of the original Indus Valley people out of those same drying-up basins and spreading into the greener areas in the rest of the subcontinent, from North to South. There's no evidence of conflict between the two.  However, the people who settled further north, being in closer proximity to the steppe people, borrowed more language and culture from the steppe people over time than the people who settled further south. So now there's a cultural gap despite them all being from more or less the same genetic stock."
ABCDesis,39hn3z,BaratheonFire,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"Romilla Thapar's recent work, that acknowledges changes in the  Aryan migration theory while explaining how Aryans were still a distinct ethnic group who identified themselves differently from other groups who didn't speak proto Indo-European languages.  The migration  theory has mostly been disbanded. There has been no major ethnic migration to alter the demographics of the subcontinent majorly in the last 25,000 years. Small groups of people have moved in, sometimes mixed with other groups and sometimes have remained staunchly endogamous, and affected cultures already existing in the subcontinent.   The two major theories now are regarding whether the proto Indo-European language spread because of Aryans continuously pushing into the Punjab Doab from the Northwest, thus coming in increasing contact and conflict with existing residents speaking in other tongues,  or,  whether ethnic groups have resided in the same areas in a geographical continuum stretching from Eastern Persia to Central India and it's not the people, only the Indo-Aryan language, which traveled through these people to become the major tongue in northern parts of the subcontinent.  Modern theories often consider the Mittani, Indo-Aryan language speaking people who conquered and became the ruling class in parts of Central Asia, to be originating from South Asia rather than bifurcating from Eastern Persia while the other group travelled south-east to cross the Hindu Kush and enter India. In fact, Romilla Thapar strongly opposes the theory that the subcontinent was geographically isolated enough to be discovered by Indo-Aryan people so late. She proposes that that the Hindu Kush was not a natural barrier to people's movement and has been ascribed that quality only by Victorian historians because it demarcated spheres of influence of the British and Russians. Many empires, like the Kushans, ruled over areas both north and south of Hindu Kush.  There is very little archeological evidence of pretty much anything in the subcontinent, primarily due to the tropical climate and partly due to layers of rebuilding over older ruins by subsequent generations. But literary evidence strongly suggests repeated clashes occurring at a time when Indo-Aryan language was noticeably different from Proto-Indo-Aryan, suggesting that the conflicts took place in the subcontinent and not in Eastern Persia or Afghanistan. The physical description of Dasyus in Aryan texts is unclear and can denote conflicts with rival Aryan groups but in later texts, the physical description of people now identified as Dravidians is very clear.  Genetically, there is a distinct difference in the occurrence of haplotypes in northern and southern Indian Y-chromosomes but those differences are from about 25,000 years ago, meaning that north Indian haplotypes have been present in the subcontinent all through the Neolithic and Bronze ages. Mitochondrial DNA, however, doesn't show any difference indicating that 25,000 years ago, people from Central Asia probably entered the subcontinent by means of war rather than as entire population (hence the proof of Central Asian genes only in males).  Sorry for the thesis but it's a fascinating topic to me!"
ABCDesis,39hn3z,TeslaModelE,4,Thu Jun 11 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"25,000 years ago   We're talking about something, the spread of Indo-European languages into India, that happened roughly 5,000 years ago. 25,000 years ago is before agriculture was invented. I think you might be mixing up two different time periods.  Also, skirmishes between herders and farmers happen all the time, often concurrently with trade and cultural exchange, so literary evidence of conflict isn't evidence of large-scale wars between ""Aryans"" and ""Dravidians"".   The migration theory has mostly been disbanded.   Well, ok, what I meant by ""migration"" is pretty close to what you're talking about. People simply shifted in their ranges over long periods of time."
ABCDesis,39hn3z,BaratheonFire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:59:02 2015 UTC,"I think you misread the 25,000 years part. My point was that there has been no major population migration into the subcontinent since 25,000 years ago during the Mesolithic period. There have been plenty of migrations but they are all small relative to the overall subcontinental population. Hence, there's no major genetic changes that happen in the subcontinental population except at that time point.   This would mean that either Indo-Aryans were living in India and simply kept pushing south-eastward or they stayed where they were (northwestern subcontinent) and only the language traveled.  The battles described in the early texts like Rigveda were definitely more than skirmishes between herders and farmers. In the later texts (not so much in the early texts), the physical differences do stand out, pointing to genetic differences rather than tribal.  As I mentioned earlier, we don't actually know whether people moved from one place to another, or its only the language that traveled and people fought each other from their own home bases."

ABCDesis,39jhua,GWmyc2,2,Fri Jun 12 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Cause ideally, I believe in a united India where there is no Bangladesh or Pakistan. The land ruled by the Brits should have been given over to our people and it should have just been all India with states carved out by ethnicity/languages kinda like now. Because of people like Jinnah (He wasn't solely the one responsible, obviously, but he did fuel the idea of a Muslim majority nation and all), there was mass chaos largely in North India with borders being drawn overnight and people that called a place like UP home had to settle out in a foreign culture out in Sindh in places like Karachi or Hyderabad. Which caused a disturbance to the natives over there when they saw an influx of people by the hundred thousands literally pouring in a year. All I see are mass disturbances of cultures, tbh. That's not natural, imo. Another common example is how many Sikhs and Hindus lived in Lahore or Muslims lived in Chandigarh and they were forced to move to the other side cause of the violence.   Also, Pakistan is an ""Islamic Republic"", although Jinnah preached that Muslims would become a minority had they stayed in India and they should form their majority nation that would welcome anyone who wishes to join, it did not turn out anything like that. Pakistan became a nation that grew very intolerant of anyone else other than (Sunni) Muslims. It's almost as if they were on a power trip. I know the idea that Jinnah didn't live long enough gets thrown around, but, this happened plenty when he was moving his home from Bombay to Karachi (or was it Lahore?).  Many people see him as a pious/righteous man, and he was anything but that. Jinnah followed the Shia Ismaili sect (leniently....very) and the same followers are being persecuted in Pakistan. I think it's a bit ironic. At the end of the day, he was a politician and a flip flopper at that. Originally, he supported a united India but disagreed and fought heavily against that idea later on. Some say because he wanted an own nation to rule. He was also heavily whitewashed by the British. Even British officials noted that he didn't seem very Indian in his manners and was very cold to approach.   Now, before anyone tells me India wasn't any better with its leaders, I agree. Seriously, laanat x lakh on all of them.   /rant  tl;dr- Jinnah divided my people along with some other goons. For example, Sindh used to have an approximate 75/25 Muslim-Hindu harmonious split. Now, it's like 85/12....at best with many of the Hindus ousted into the more rural areas and not the bustling cities like once was."

ABCDesis,39jhua,pspguy123,3,Fri Jun 12 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"I actually feel the same way as you do about partition and all that followed, except that I don't necessarily think poorly of Jinnah. I do think that he chose to be on the wrong side of the ideological divide that resulted in partition, but I don't feel that this decision was cut and dry for him. As you mentioned, he was also a supporter of a united India at first. So while the change in his thinking had tragic consequences,  I don't see evidence that this change in his thinking was due to a moral or judgmental lapse. I don't have any reason to believe that he wasn't chasing the power that would come from making Pakistan, but at the same time, I don't feel that he was chasing power from the get-go, considering that he had to be convinced to return from the UK to fight for an eventual Pakistan.  I think Jinnah wanted to make an exemplary South Indian nation. He was clearly a very talented and extremely ambitious man, and he simply used the momentum behind the cause of Muslim rights to fuel the creation of a new nation based on his ideals. This was by no means a noble course of action but I think his determination and ambition are admirable. If he lived long enough to shake the premise of an Islamic Republic that predicates the creation of Pakistan and actually managed to instill the idea of a Pakistan where Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, etc. are fairly represented, we might have had a very different Pakistan today. With that said, I don't think that it's surprising that a country based on the idea of ""Muslim dominance"" became entirely consumed by that paltry idea, and I do think that one could blame Jinnah for not having the insight of seeing this in advance."
ABCDesis,39jhua,pakiinbetweener,2,Fri Jun 12 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think poorly of his ideological ""flip-flopping""; the Nehruvian-Gandhis were very good at disguising their actual intentions from the rhetoric they provided individual regions and minorities. I think Jinnah had good foresight to recognize their bluff, albeit I don't agree with partitioning countries on religious lines in any case. I do think he lacked some foresight to predict what would happen to this country based on his successors in the years following."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,premeddit,17,Thu Jun 11 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"I actually fully agree with you. People have to realize that culture is technically solely the reality of the environment you grew up in-you can grow up in a ""whitewashed"" culture and its perfectly natural-brown people aren't inherently connected to Desi cultures. Having pride for your heritage is a much different thing. We're all on different spectrums on this, too, of being ""whitewashed"" and ""prod Desi"". My only issue personally is when people who distance themselves from the culture see themselves as superior or more civilized to those who choose to connect with it.  ...aaaaand that ties into my personal problem with Jindal-Haley identity politics. As a Sikh, I think Nikki Haley has every right to convert to a Sikh for whatever the fuck reason she wants; even if solely for political reasons, its absolutely her choice. What I get annoyed at is how they use this to tie into how they relate to Desi Americans. Bobby Jindal's made his anti-hyphenated-American speech more times than I care to remember (the basic gist is that we should all stop being African-Americans, Italian-Americans, etc and just be American), and while that belief is fine on its own, he specifically relates his position as a Desi to that. Nikki Haley when near her Sikh constituents talks about ""how this community means so much to me,"" yet in front of her Christian right implicitly links her conversion to Christianity and adaptation of a white name to being more assimilated than those of us who choose not to."

ABCDesis,39hz9j,sindibindi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is in the title. OP says ABCDs then says Indian culture. If he wants to talk about Indians in America, could have just said Indian-American.  Basically, the correct way to say this respectfully is that OP should have stated his issue with ABCDs bad mouthing for being Americanized, should have stated how any particular ABCD can have gripes with their culture, and then stated how he didn't like how people had issues with Bobby Jindal, an Indian (or Indian-American, or American...I have no idea at this point, lol!) who believes in a Christian sect.   I do want him to be specific because this is arguably the most diverse region (in comparison with its size) in the world. You can't expect someone to be lenient and expect them to get away by saying ""you know what I mean."" I find it insulting, personally. It's like you don't acknowledge my background and I'm just lumped up with others cause you're too lazy to learn about another. I have the same issue when people say ""Africans"". Okay....what part of Africa? Lol! When someone tells me that they're American, I still make a note to differentiate because someone from New England like me has different views and even American culture from someone in Louisiana.  In regards to the actual post, whatever OP said completely misses me, for example. It's very Brahmin Hindu centric. I don't do puja, garba, or believe in Christianity, yet I have a very brown (and oily!) skin. Or care for Bobby Jindal. You can go a step further and say I'm apathetic about the deep South. And I identify myself as an Asian Indian, a breed between NRI and an ABCD. =)   And on a side note, partially unrelated- It's really annoying to me when people talk about India and only recall Punjabi/Gujju/North Indian culture and seemingly forget every other front of the country."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,x6tance,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:43:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you partially. But you have to remember that OP is both an ABCD and an American-Indian, and as a reader, you would be expected to have the ability to distinguish & conclude that OP is an indian and if he was pakistani, he would have talked about Pakistani culture.   Additionally, one cannot always think about every segment of the society when one makes a comment.   To illustrate: You an American will be unable to make any statement about Americans that holds true for every type of American.  ""As an American, I love the USA"" would be wrong,  ""Americans love hamburgers"" would be wrong, and even ""Americans speak english would be wrong"" because they all have exceptions.   So yes maybe OP could have clarified a bit more, but I think we should be able to expect some common sense from fellow readers."

To me, pride in your culture is being happy with yourself and comfortable in your own skin. Culture is arguably a large part of your identity. I'm not just talking garbas, but it's the way you were raised, your way of thinking, your way of life. Why deny that? It just seems too exhausting."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,sampak,0,Sat Jun 13 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"Why deny that?

ABCDesis,39hz9j,sampak,4,Thu Jun 11 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"culture does not equal religion   Well you're defining culture as something minus religion and social norms, which is not usually how people think of it. Even the other parts of culture are usually intertwined with the social norms and the religion. I really don't know how much of desi culture is left if you exclude Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism, and the ""traditional family structure"" (arranged marriage, extended family, etc.).   I think you can disagree with certain aspects of a culture and yet still take pride in the good.   I mean I'm kind of arguing for the sake of arguing, but we've had this discussion before. We're placing extra burdens on brown people if they have to be aware and active in and explicitly proud of their culture, but white people have no such burden.

Look at the style of the house you are living in for example. Its most likely Western. That's part of their culture. We take part in it without even thinking about it. They have no such 'burden' because they don't have to have it. They are not the minorities in a Western country. They don't have to keep anything alive. Its assumed that we will be the ones who are adjusting (rightly so, immigrants have to assimilate)."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,LotusEyes92,14,Fri Jun 12 01:07:41 2015 UTC,This forum is mostly populated by ABCDs and 1st gen immigrants with an interest in their Desi roots/origins. So I am not sure this is the best forum for someone who wants to completely ignore their Desi-ness.

I think he absolutely deserves all the criticism he gets on this sub. Its very difficult to respect a person who is ashamed of who they are.   Criticising your culture and country isn't wrong.

ABCDesis,39hz9j,LotusEyes92,2,Fri Jun 12 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"I am speaking for myself here. What if your parents taught you your culture in a fearful and pressuring way? What if it was something they never let you enjoy, but forcefully shoved down your throat without explaining or letting you enjoy it? What if culture was just a way for you to be forced to do things you didn't quite understand the reasons to? And were never explained? And when you asked, you were yelled at? What if any slightest deviation from your culture felt like a death-threat to your crazy mother?  This is how my culture was introduced to me. And that's why as a young immigrant here, I grew to hate it. It was never my culture, it was the bullshit way my parents pushed it on me.

I'm not an ambassador for Indian-Americans or somehow representative of anyone but myself.   Just to make it clear, I'm not saying he converted for votes.    Well actually, you did. Let me quote:   Or are trying to get votes by denying who you are. This is a man that has despicable beliefs.   I don't see how your statement can get any clearer than that; you stated he rejected his identity (including religion) for votes. I'd just like to know if there's a single piece of solid evidence you can procure to show that Jindal threw his people under the bus for political gain. A slightly lighter shaded portrait is questionable ""evidence"" at best."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,LotusEyes92,9,Thu Jun 11 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"you stated he rejected his identity (including religion) for votes.    He has made many comments about topic of foreigners coming to US and not shedding their foreign identity. This is all when talking to a white majority audience. This why it comes across as pandering to an audience. No one is expecting him to be a representative of Desi people just as Obama not a representative of the black people. Obama never denied the fact that he is a minority.   Maybe someone else will link the actual quotes, but that is my perception of Jindal."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,FaceofHoe,7,Thu Jun 11 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"I meant the portrait which is an example of him trying to be something he is not. And the despicable beliefs was about his stand on things like homosexuality. Not his Christianity. Sorry if it came across that way. He is denying his skin colour to try and make himself more like white people so that he can get votes. And yes OFCOURSE that's wrong. And yes I do think not having a pride in your roots is bad. Again, pride doesn't mean you have to agree with everything in your culture or take part in all aspects of it. But don't try to be something you are not. Don't try to change your fucking skin colour to fit in.   And ""slightly lighter shaded portrait""? You might wanna go take a better look at said portrait. And how is it questionable evidence?"

ABCDesis,39hz9j,translocated-hillman,6,Fri Jun 12 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Sure. But most of the Telugu film industry is no longer rooted in Andhra culture by any means beyond the language. K. Viswanath produced some of the most authentically Telugu movies of all time. Most of today's flopbusters are just item songs connected by a loose plot and some poorly choreographed fight scenes. There are still some pretty good films produced, but there's a much larger number of obscene and tasteless films than before. I'm not even nostalgic; I wasn't even born when most of these great films were made. But you can clearly see the difference when watching them."

But if you puff up your chest and walk around saying you are tall... people will consider you weird, not because you are short, but because you seem be unhinged from reality. This is also the time when people recognize that you have self esteem issues.   Bobby Jindal is no different. He can call himself an American all he wants, but he will always be an Indian-American. He will be an Indian-American whether he goes to the church or not, whether he is a governor or not, and whether he likes indian culture or not, because at the end of the day, your race is a constant.

What is ""Indian culture""? India, and South Asia in general, is not one homogenous area. As previous threads on this subreddit have showed, there are many people here who don't identify with ""India"" as one big entity and thus would prefer not to use ""Indian-American"" to describe themselves because, well, ""Indian"" isn't an ethnicity.   Regarding the topic of Jindal, I think people are assuming that because he converted (disregard all the people who have converted for their own reasons, such as genuinely believing in a religion), etc., he's ""ashamed of his identity."" But what's not to say that his Christian identity (and he seems quite devout) is what he truly believes in/sees himself as (and why should he be forced to loudly state some identity people feel he should say, when he himself perhaps has stronger ties and identifies more by his Christian background, etc.)? There are other areas I may disagree with him on but I don't think I would jump to conclusions and call him a ""race traitor"" (which is generally a word I dislike because well, who are other people to say that they think someone is/is not ""cultural"" enough)."

Just because everyone speaks English in NYC does not mean they have a single culture. Culture is what a bunch of people do.  NYers overwhelming walk, that could be a part of their culture, they have busy lives, they take mass transportation... and on and on. That does not preclude smaller groups from having some additional cultural attributes. Investment Banker's culture may include 130hr work weeks and strip clubs; and the manhattan desi culture may include some hindu temple or a theater..

Like I said, ""Indian"" is not an ethnicity, and the whole umbrella of ""Indian"" is generally not considered a race either. For example, a Sindhi from Kashmir may identify more in this regard to someone from Tehran; someone whose family is from Aizawl may feel themselves very different from someone who grew up in Mumbai. To call all of this one umbrella term and feel that everyone should identify with this over-arching term seems like a rather narrow-minded view."

If the group was all white - it would be called American even if it included italian-americans, irish-americans.... etc.   Similarly anyone linked to India, be it an assamese or a keralite, will still be termed indian. While we do have multiple racial influences (dravidian, mongloid, indo-aryan... and god knows what else)  The chinese have been in the US since 1840 and still are not called American - they are Chinese American.

Their ethnic identity is something entirely different.  Americans in India are categorized as American because that's what they are, regardless of what their racial make up is. If I, as an American, go to India, I expect to be viewed as an American and will raise a shitstorm otherwise.  I think you're conflating national identity with ethnic and racial identity. They are two very distinct things."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,energyturtle_ak,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"Regardless, the point here is that ethnic or racial identities cannot be changed by individuals. The Irish and Italians became White at a certain point in American history but an Irish or Italian immigrant in 1850s' America, whether s/he liked it personally or not, was not considered White.   Today, Italians or Irish don't look different except that they simply happen to be categorized as White. Your social category has very little to do with what you choose to call yourself."

Sure, your example might work (though on another note, when you say ""run-of-the-mill average American"", that sounds like you're assuming they're all white), but again, that may not be the case for everyone (and we don't need to put ""enforcements"" on whatever that is)."

ABCDesis,39hz9j,kinsho,2,Fri Jun 12 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"Something i read on another article (discussing this exact subject --> http://gawker.com/no-indian-friends-1700471892?rev=1431528445902 ) which needs to be shared here:  You have certainly hit the nail on the head when you mentioned that Indians are always the uncool minority in the US of A. But here is the rub: Indians who embrace their uncoolness and carry on regardless usually end up finding success and happiness. Their stories frequently have happy endings, or at the very least don’t have miserable endings. You will find those Indians everywhere, from the bloke pumping gas for you in Edison (NJ and its weirdness, amirite?) to the talented neurosurgeon who stands as an antidote to idjits like Dr. Oz.  The other kind of Indian.... oh well. The self-flagellation that they subject themselves to - it is honestly hard to comprehend. The deep desire to hide their skin colour and melt into the crowd, the conscious rejection of their own culture, their history, their language, even - all of this must and absolutely does leave deep scars. Indians make very internally conflicted immigrants. They don’t really buy into the American dream, or believe the idea of American exceptionalism - because unlike many other immigrants, their home is still, in many cases, the “mainland”. And then again, Indians are a very heteregenous group, a fact that is usually lost on white people.  Anyway, where was I going with this - oh yes... I have seen quite a few coconuts and bananas in my time. Not that anyone was asking, but my unsolicited two cents is simply this - do not turn your back on your people and your culture. Because that will leave you an orphan.    Anyway, I wish Bobby a successful political career, and for his sake, I hope he is truly accepted as one of 'their own'.   Me, personally...i'd just rather not be a pretentious dweeb. Each to their own though."

Being proud of our culture and heritage is really the only way to resist, and perhaps survive, in a country that really hates anyone who isn't white. Got it? Look at all the threads about ABCDs who hate dating within their community. Or the ones who recount anxiety about their Indian identity. Or the ones who tell stories about being made fun of for bringing Indian food to school. Or how about the moms who get harassed for wearing a salwar kameez outside the house? Reading this article makes me cringe: http://gawker.com/no-indian-friends-1700471892?rev=1431528445902 . Look being Indian in the US isn't fun, and we get sh*t precisely for being Indian. Being (excessively) proud of our heritage is one way we get through living in the US. Maybe you're a special snowflake, and you can get by without this stuff. But a lot of us can't.

ABCDesis,39hz9j,trctn4238934,2,Fri Jun 12 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"What is wrong with not having pride in your roots?   Nothing. On the contrary, I personally think ethnic pride is pretty silly. Especially when people celebrate the success of Indian-Americans (Satya Nadella, Sunita Williams, to name a few) by gloating about how smart Indians are. I find it very circlejerk-ey. Like ""oooh, see brown people are rad""!  That being said, I also understand people wanting to share their heritage and taking pride in it. So to each their own.  I think the problem this sub tends to have towards people like Bobby Jindal and Mindy Kaling is that people are equating their shunning of their roots to their being ashamed of their identity. It's not equivalent, but in real life it happens quite often. I've seen a lot of ABCDs act that way.  There's nothing wrong with not wanting to associate with Indian culture, there's also nothing wrong with wanting to hold on to your heritage, but doing both of these for the wrong reasons - shame and ethnic pride (along the lines of white pride, if you know what I mean) is made fun of."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,pomegranita,7,Fri Jun 12 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I'm not sure what you have against ethnic pride. People are tribalistic by nature, so pride in ethnicity isn't some sort of aberrant feeling.   Besides that, a lot of white people I've known do exhibit pride in their ethnic group. I know Italians that are proud of fellow Italians that go on to achieve big things. Same with Jewish people, British folk, German people, Danish folk, Irish people, etc.  Hell, my old college roommate is like a 3rd or 4th generation Norwegian-American, and he was very proud of Magnus Carlsen."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,oneearth,2,Fri Jun 12 02:06:28 2015 UTC,"I think people misuse the word pride, or maybe I just have a different definition. I think its weird to be proud of being Indian because it's not a choice for me. It's not something that I produced or accomplished. It's like saying I'm proud to be a man. It makes no sense to me when people say that they're proud of other Indians. We were all born this way, we can't help it."
ABCDesis,39hz9j,Happy-feets,5,Fri Jun 12 02:08:36 2015 UTC,It's similar to sports fans. Why do people celebrate their team's win when they obviously didn't have anything to do with it. If you ask me that's just how humans are. If you can be proud of who you are then you can also be proud of your group and what it has achieved. You just need a strong attachment to your group. If there are a 1000 different genders then I suspect we will start seeing people who are proud to be men too. It's just that there are too many men to make people feel special because of being a man. That's just my pet theory.
ABCDesis,39hz9j,Fuadius,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but I thought that ethnic pride is a well researched topic and it's just that people can't make sense of the world unless they categorize it (e.g. in ethnicities) and that people also have a (strong) desire to ""belong"", so ethnic pride is the result of that.   It's also reactive in the sense that for example white colonialists have put the black race down in times of slavery and black pride has risen out of that (even on plantations etc. with maroons, but I've only read this in fiction), but it doesn't have to be."

ABCDesis,39grqr,1abcd2throwaway3,5,Thu Jun 11 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeesh your life is a roller coaster  Gay, atheist, and depressed. I don't think your parents are equipped to deal with any of this. They didn't grow up in a place where it was accepted, and I know my parents would have problems with dealing with this too. I mean my parents don't have to, but they'd be in shock if they had to. But yeah financially I think your parents are being pretty irresponsible. My parents constantly tell me about the sacrifices they make to pay for my education but that's because it's true (and they do pay for all of my college expenses, although scholarships reduced the amount considerably). $25,000 on temple decorations is a lot, and if it's causing them to not be able to pay for your education they have a bad sense of prioritization."
ABCDesis,39grqr,BaratheonFire,4,Thu Jun 11 20:45:30 2015 UTC,If my parents spent 25 grand on temple decorations (of all charitable donations to make!) then I'd be furious. Maybe the temple should fund their retirement (maybe that was mean...)
ABCDesis,39grqr,recycledpaper,3,Thu Jun 11 23:53:24 2015 UTC,That's kinda mean but seriously 25k is an absurd number if you're not a millionaire. I don't know what's going through these people's heads money wise. Idk if OP didn't give us the full picture or if they're just fiscally retarded.

As long as you make sure you have your own credit account and can get loans, cutting them out financially should be a breeze. Cutting them out of your life is also easier when you live so far away and have a good enough social circle.

You're a little late on the rebellious teen phase, but better late than never. You've still got decades and decades to build a real, human-to-human relationship with your parents. That process can't start, though, until you start acting like your own person. They'll be shocked, but they'll get over it. And if they don't? Well honestly, what have you lost then?

ABCDesis,39c4ey,immilaw,11,Thu Jun 11 11:38:33 2015 UTC,"I used to hate (still do) big weddings.  When I was planning my wedding, I butted heads with my parents big time over the size of the guest list and the fact that I only knew about 10% of the guests.  But I eventually figured out that weddings in desi communities are a pretty important tool for networking .  Desis prefer to do business with people they have a personal relationship with.  If you have any entrepreneurial aspirations, hosting large social (networking) events is pretty much required.  For example, my uncle is a very successful business owner who gets a lot of contracts from the desi community. His annual Diwali pooja/dinner has over 500 invitees.  He rents out massive wedding venues for the event and he always tells me that business shoots up the month or 2 following the Diwali party.  It also helps your parents in social settings.  Inviting their friends and neighbors can help establish a better relationship between them, which is beneficial as they get older. It's a good idea for desi parents to have a support system, especially if you live far away from them. I am in India now and I have attended a bunch of weddings and dinners at relatives and neighbors' homes. I don't enjoy it one bit, but I do it so my parents will continue to be close with their circle of friends and hopefully enjoy their support as they age in India, far away from me and my sister."
ABCDesis,39c4ey,applesandcherry,6,Thu Jun 11 02:35:49 2015 UTC,Yeah this would be the only reason if I ever had a big wedding -- so my parents can reconnect with old friends when they're older and my brother and I are away living our own lives. Indian (though not only Indian and not all parents) parents tend to make their entire lives about their children so when it's time for us to start our own lives it's reassuring that they have others to still be social with.

I do kind off want my parents and sisters and other close family and friends there, but just as small as possible and not a 3 day event.  My sisters are already saying I will have the best/most extravagant wedding because our family has had a lot of practice planning them (I am one of the youngest) and one of my best friends was jokingly saying that I'm not allowed to wear a simple dress at my wedding (which I want) because that's not desi etc.  I have one distant cousin who had the smallest, most beautiful ceremony instead of a huge wedding, but it was with her boyfriend of 8 years and they lived together. I am getting more and more adamant In wanting to do it that way and if I am really clear about it and explain how I feel to my parents, I think they will agree.

Vegas had always appealed to me so that's what my husband and I did - we eloped. He couldn't stand the idea of a big wedding either.   It pissed off a few people and caused a bit of drama but there will be some drama either way. It was totally worth it though - I only got a few months of crap from people afterwards (mainly my mother) rather than the 1 year+ leading up to it like most of my friends who went the traditional wedding route suffered... some of them were on the verge of breakdowns (including my brother & SIL who married a few months before us...

We still had a lavish Italian 6 course meal and open bar at the MGM, but no one felt like it was a bore.  Or a week long commitment.

I mean... it's just a contract. Just like in sport, it's just a ceremony where people get together to watch people sign a contract to say that they'll live with eachother and put up with eachother's shit for as long as they can. It doesn't do anything else.   But if my views change [and, to be honest, they probably will. If I found the right person, I'd probably [and stupidly] go head-over-heels for them and say ""ZOMG. LETS GET MARRIED!!1!!1!""], I'd only want a small wedding with people that I [and my future bride] would want to be there. My extended family's attitude towards it kind of bugs me. My cousin in Sweden married a guy, and repeatedly said that she didn't want any fuss. She just wanted to have a small ceremony and then call it a day. However, the entire family turned against her and essentially forced her to throw a reception with family from across the globe.   I spoke to my uncle [another cousin's father] while I was in Sweden, and he said that ""it's not about her, you have to do these things to please your parents.""  I'd probably be more willing to have a big wedding if Indian weddings weren't so long, drawn out, and full of politics. But if I do get married, I'd just want a very small wedding. Plus, I hate being the centre of attention / celebration, so I'd probably just look very pissed off on my wedding day. I wouldn't want too many people to see that."

When my husband and I first met we talked about 2, maybe 3 (wanted a boy/girl, if the first two didn't fulfill that, try for a third but that's the most.) Now we've been married for 2 years and... maybe we don't want kids. I think we're both in the 'maaaybe 1 kid. Maybe.' I'm so glad that both our minds seem to be changing together.  I'm terrified of being pregnant. Just the idea of it, of body changes I can't control...and then giving birth. That's the main thing that's stopping me. My husband just doesn't care either way. He'd be fine with 1 or 2, or none. (I'm allowed 5 'creatures' - whether it's kids or animals or a combination haha. Currently have 3 animals).  I haven't mentioned this to my parents yet. Husband have 4-5 years before we hit the age where we said we'd start trying, who knows what we'll think then. I think if we decide no kids, I just won't mention it to my parents. If they bring it up I'll be like 'it'll happen when/if it happens' and just stay quiet until I'm 'too old'."

She mentioned that she would really miss being pregnant which was kind of comforting to hear. She said she would miss the baby's kicks and he/she moving around.

It's a travesty if anyone has to make choices against their will, whether it's having children or not having children, or being forced into marriage.  But at the same time, having children doesn't make women less ""badass."" Lots of accomplished women were mothers, and now that society is much better about working mothers, we can look forward to even more of them.  As for myself - a few years ago, I was very against having children. Now, while I'm not craving children or anything, I'm open to it. It seems like an adventure, like my research, or moving to a new place, or getting a new pet, is an adventure. Assuming that my body cooperates, we'll probably try for a child once we're married.  It's important to keep in mind that there's some truth to ""beta, you'll change your mind,"" in the sense that this is something that some (not all) people change their minds on, as they move from their early twenties to late twenties/early thirties. It's a pretty big shift in lifestyle from college, to being settled mid-career. There's no reason to feel like you need to have a Final Decision on Children at 23."

I don't think the act of having a child makes a woman's accomplishments less deserving of praise in any way - I think the point I was trying to get across is that women in our culture ARE often expected to sacrifice their hopes, dreams and aspirations for the sake of family/children, or at least arrange their whole lives around that without question."

ABCDesis,39bm3t,HeroHiraLal,2,Thu Jun 11 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"When I started dating my now wife one of the corner stones of our fledgling relationship  was that we both wanted to be CF. But life is not a certainty - so there 's that off chance that we may change our decision.  Thankfully my family is supportive in their own way - ""we want you to have kids, but its a private matter between you and your wife"".   Life is already hard and neither of us super human abilities which need to be passed on. Being CF is a very private decision and we are not very vocal about it but at this point people who ""know"" us, have a fair bit of idea that having kids is not on the table.   CF or not CF - This decision is not a single sided decision - You probably don't want a relationship with someone who is not on the same page. Sex and how the significant other values money (not just rich/poor) being the other two.   who are pressured to sacrifice their lives, interests and a significant chunk of their careers in order to >fulfill the ""obligation"" of having children and getting married.   I am not completely comfortable with this tone - This undermines countless women and men who actually want/have kids and still have very successful professional and personal lives.    Also its not about obligation; its about how you are conditioned - and its not necessary bad to follow the societal convention of having kids. It is what it is, not necessarily evil or bad."
ABCDesis,39bm3t,HeroHiraLal,3,Wed Jun 10 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input! I definitely agree with you that there are people who want to and actively choose to have children, but I am speaking from my own personal experiences in that particular instance.   Also, you can't deny that South Asian cultures put disproportionate pressure on women to bear children and harbor most of the responsibility of caregiving in general (in terms of caring for both the elderly and the young.) More generally, Desi women are often expected to sacrifice themselves and their happiness at the expense of their families.   I do, in fact, know many Desi women who have privately (and not-so privately) confided to me that they had never expected or wanted children but that their families had pressured them in ways both subtle and obvious to decide otherwise. This isn't about knocking successful people who have children, but to acknowledge the pressure that women in our cultures especially face to conform to gender roles, especially on this issue.   Having children isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's a decision that needs to be made freely and fairly. That's often not the case in our cultural background."
ABCDesis,39bm3t,teapot_doc,0,Wed Jun 10 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, women are expected to conform to gender roles.    know many Desi women who have privately (and not-so privately) confided to me that they had never expected or wanted children but that their families had pressured them in ways both subtle and obvious to decide otherwise.    But there's more to it - sure, there's an expectation - but there's free will too - If you don't want to have kids, nobody can force you (legally) to have kids.  These women actively made a decision to have kids to please their family because for them their family and relationship with their husband was more important than having or not having kids. It all boils down to how strong your (""individual"") convictions are. Free will comes at a cost and these women were not willing to pay it.    but it's a decision that needs to be made freely and fairly.    As I mentioned in my post earlier - This is one of the decision which cannot be made in isolation, there's another party involved.   Putting an exclusively south Asian context to this would also be unfair - I think it is the greater issue of gender roles - some women actively pursue them, some don't. There will always be societal pressures in doing anything which against the accepted mentality.  Expecting CF (like many other things eg LGBT) to gain complete mainstream acceptance would be foolishness. It will be always something for which you have to fight against the grain. One of the ways to deal with it, is to be low key about it and find a partner who is on the same page."

But unless you consciously decide to have a kid, being childless is the default. So I guess I did plan it in a sense. Either way, here I am. 39, no kids.  There are plenty of times that I'm thrilled about it. Like when I wake up on Saturday morning at 10 am and shuffle from my bed to the kitchen to the TV and back for like 2 hours before doing anything significant? I'm so frickin glad that I didn't have to wipe shit from an ass instead. All my income is mine, and I fly all over the country on a whim. If there's a band in town that I want to see, I just go the club, have a couple of beers, and head home whenever I want. It's bliss.  But then I think about the blood in my veins and how it is the rarest thing in the universe. No one else has this exact DNA, and that's because I am the product of millions of years of living things procreating. Trillions of my would-be cousins died along the way, but my fragile little branch of the life tree survived. I dunno; I feel like I have a duty to the universe to at least pass this on. I know it's fashionable these days to say there are too many people, but that's absurd to me. We are one pandemic away from a massive cull of the population, and it just doesn't seem like our puny little minds are qualified to rationalize away the idea of life creating new life.  The other, more selfish urge is that I like me. I'm pretty smart, was a decent (albeit undersized) athlete, chicks used to dig me when I was younger, I'm endlessly empathetic, I'm pretty good at relating to people, and I'm even modest outside of this sentence. But I will die in the next 50-75 years, and with me so will all of these traits that I've grown to love. If I had a kid, I could maybe pass some of them on. I think a lot of people my age feel this way. I didn't have this perspective on time 15-20 years ago.  So anyway, I don't have kids and probably won't. I would be a sperm donor if they'd let me. And if I met the right girl, I might consider giving up those Saturday mornings.  (I have a wonderful gf, but I don't know if the two of us together are parent material)"

It was exactly as it sounded: a highway truck stop. Imagine one of those construction sites with a ton of sand heaped in the front. Now imagine someone crudely spread the sand and erected a thatch roof atop a few bamboo poles. That was MV.  Outside of the shop (also known as a dosa kadai) was a large iron pan resting atop a crudely fashioned hollow brick stand. Inside the stand burnt firewood. A shirtless, lungied, ""master"" stood in front of this hearth, pouring one of two things: omelet or dosa batter. He also would have an array of what appear like glistening eggs. These are ""barrotas"" (the Tamilized version of parathas, and not really anything like the North Indian thing).   One would walk into this sandy spot, find a flies-infested table-chair, and snap fingers. A cleaner kid (mostly) would hurry up, sweep off flecks of food down to the ground (where normally a sleeping mongrel will wake up and walk around doing clean up duty) and place a bucket of sambar (far stretch) and/or a bucket of kozhambu (a spicy sauce with meat in it).   You order one of three things: dosa, omelet, or a holy combination of both, mutta dosa (egg dosa). You could also order a ""half ayl"" or a ""full ayl"" which translates to eggs over easy or eggs over hard. No idea wtf ayl means.  Then you wait, and watch your meal get prepared by the master. When the food arrives, it's steaming hot and sizzling. You pour out bucket-sambar or bucket-kozhambu all over your order and dig in before the flies set in.  The meal is done in no time, and you are left with a strange thirst. Now you head out and to the nearby hole-in-the-wall store where you can find cigarettes, paan parag, and, most importantly, panir soda. Against all odds, this has no paneer in it. It's merely rose-flavored soda with a marble for a cap. You place your thumb on top of the marble, pop it down, and enjoy this refresher on a scorching hot day.  Rinse. Wash. Repeat for dinner."

I've seen it sold at Pazhamuthir shops across Chennai, in addition to the small stalls that have a Bovonto/Kalimark banner.  If you are really adventurous, you should try Kalimark.

The operative word being ""become"". which means he wanted to run for office, campaigned, and snagged the votes to become the governor.  I don't think there is a latent bias against Indian-Americans in the democratic party. It's just that Indians in America, in general, don't see politics as a viable occupation. It's fraught with perils, and there is no job security. If Indian parents have drilled one thing into their kids' heads, it's to find a secure job first.  You probably also don't see too many Chinese government officials for the same reason. And they make up the majority of the Asian minorities."

ABCDesis,39b7or,energyturtle_ak,4,Wed Jun 10 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"Well I do agree with you on the part about Indian Americans and Republicans. Considering that Democrats haven't exactly done much for standing up viable (electable) Indian-American candidates. Even ideologically speaking, 1st generation Indian immigrants tend to mirror a lot of traditional conservative values (Social and Fiscal). So they're a natural fit in many ways.  There have been many articles that have tried to analyze possible reason why Indians tend to favor democrats over republicans. The main reason being that christian right has too much influence on the GOP and that tends to turn off a lot of Indian-American voters.  But you're right that despite being 1% of the population, Republicans still manage to have 2 governors in office that are of Indian origin. More than any other Asian ethnic group.   Also, I'm a registered republican and tend to lean right. My problem isn't with the fact that Jindal got elected. My problem is that he's pandering to everything and anyone willing to listen to stay relevant. (i.e See Muslim only areas in London quote)."

ABCDesis,39b7or,GWmyc2,7,Wed Jun 10 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"The things with the Republican party that keep me (a fiscal conservative and social libertarian) voting Democrat are as follows:   I don't agree that insane military spending is a wise fiscal choice Creating a quasi-Christian hegemony in America under the cover of social conservatism is bad new bears for members of other religions, such as myself, and doesn't honor the Constitution of this country   Basically everything else both parties do is not significantly different from each other.  I don't expect politicians to be decent or respectful but I know that Democrats will at least on paper respect my rights as a non-white non-Christian, while Republicans work actively to erode those rights.  I have a lot of unpopular opinions about socially liberal stalwart topics but I don't actively oppose gay marriage or similar movements because it's not my business to get in the way of others' rights.  And I see the Democrats supporting that, although they also support more liberal positions than I would, so I vote for them.  I'd rather have too many rights that I'd never exercise than constrain my existence to punish someone else.  TL;DR ABCDs are conservative but not white, so they don't vote Republican because they're not sheeple"

ABCDesis,39awm5,slucious,8,Wed Jun 10 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"Parents can care without micromanaging. My parents are super liberal (not talking about politics) and trusted me with my own decisions. They talked to me about the pros and cons of everything and always explained why they had certain rules, like I had to be with a guy friend after 9pm and after 11 I had to be at someone's house, not wandering around (in Mumbai). I was given freedom and I never hid one thing from them. They know I drink and date and have sex and don't care, because I'm responsible. They always treated me appropriately for my age.  It doesn't have to be either 'move out by 18 and pay for college yourself if you don't want to live by my rules' or 'do as I tell you and be grateful for the money'. I mean, they chose to have a kid. They know college is expensive. It's unfair to put that ultimatum on your own kid. Another perspective is if you give your kid that ultimatum, you make the kid feel bad for choosing to move out (and many parents can be immature and be angry if they choose to do so). It's also unfair to have unreasonable rules, especially in a society where everyone is different except for your family. You can't expect your kid to be torn apart between two worlds while you refuse to adapt. Don't date? Only go out with approved friends? What the hell? That shit stops being legit once you turn 18 - 16 for me, really. Isn't it better to explain to your kid the dangers and benefits of everything and then trust them, rather than all this sneaking around?"

The situation I am talking about - which was the situation I was in - is where the parent has strict rules on curfews, who you can go to the movies with, etc etc. I had a strict curfew, I was not allowed to go out with guys (what they don't know won't hurt them ;) ). But I had to follow their rules.  What I saw with my white friends was that their parents did not kick them out, but they were required to pay for their own tuition and pay rent if they came back home after. A cheaper rent, sure, but it was still something. I don't know what it's like for desi guys, but for the girls (me and my friends) we didn't have anything like this.  With abuse, the situation is harder. I think we can all easily say what we would do if we were in that situation, but when it actually happens it's difficult, and reaching out for support/advice/help is definitely a good thing!"
ABCDesis,39awm5,bug-bear,9,Wed Jun 10 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. I just feel like when it comes to desi households - the line between being strict and emotional abuse is a rather thin one. A lot of threads that I've seen tend to straddle that line where it's easy for one to be confused for the other."
ABCDesis,39awm5,BaratheonFire,3,Wed Jun 10 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yes I was just thinking that - it really is a thin, confused line. I remember crying abuse at my mother about stupid shit when I was a teenager (it definitely wasn't abuse). My parents may have had strict rules, but I was never guilted into anything."
ABCDesis,39awm5,bug-bear,0,Wed Jun 10 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"But then the Indian kids can ask their parents no to pay for their education right and be independent. But no they want to have the cake and eat it also. Not many white people boot out their kids, but from my conversations with my colleagues apparently it is strongly indicated they should. You don't have to throw out your kids, you can make then feel unwanted so that they move out."
ABCDesis,39awm5,BaratheonFire,10,Wed Jun 10 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a model for a healthy society - make your kids feel unwanted, so that they move out. Like the parenting version of a constructive dismissal in the workplace. Forgive me if I am a little skeptical of that being the norm for white people - cause... it's not.  Take a look at the average thread that comes up on here regarding parenting around that age. Plenty of people want to be independent and move out - but the parents guilt and pressure them into staying and accepting the housing, money, etc... If it was as easy as you say, you don't think it would happen more often? (Bad) desi parenting thrives on and is centred around CONTROL. Controlling the funding around education is part of that."

ABCDesis,39726o,flamegrl13,21,Tue Jun 9 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm from Georgia, but I've lived in the mid-west and now I am in New England. Honestly, Atlanta is fantastic. It's too big a city to really deal with the level of hillbilly-fuckery that the rest of the U.S. presumes about us. My visits to IL never made me feel that they had such a specific conception of the South, but I can see it's possible. However New England has been the most ignorant about it's 'reading' of the contemporary Southern US.  Atlanta is such a diverse city, it is very unlikely you will feel the direct sorts of racism people paint it the South to have. Yes, you can go out to the outskirts/farm land/Appalachian region and probably run into some play banjo/marry your sister-cousin people, but unless you're super interested in becoming a peanut farmer in no-where GA...you'll probably not encounter too much of that. There is something that is both hospitable and yet direct about the South that is absent in New England, the mid-west was a bit closer to the South [but I know how diverse the mid-west is too from living there].  For example, where I live in Western MA there is this presumption that they really just aren't racist here, they're too aware of issues of 'social justice' and their role in the civil war means that racism never was 'fostered' here. Any person who watches the news can see through that bullshit. But the dominant narrative is North isn't racist, that is a character trait of the South. However, what I have noticed here is a latent but rampant cultural appropriation that is often mistaken as cultural sharing. It's a very quiet, but ever-present 'othering' that happens to play out. Of course, it's always easy to say you're not racist, but if you live in a place where people of other races can hardly afford to live...you may have a issue on hand. I live in a rural part of the region, this is farm land that is surrounded by some of the best private liberal arts schools in the country. Guess what? I have yet to see a non-white family hosting a farm stand at the fucking farmers market that was grown on a large, historically family-owned farm. I do however see plenty of hispanic workers on the fields and in the back of the restaurants where I can get watered down ethnic cuisine. Sure, no one's racist here...because we all know that diversity in historical land ownership was oh-so prevalent here (sarcasm). Racism and socio-economic disparities are visible all over the U.S., you just have to look at their history to see how they may end up expressing those issues today. Then you'll see racism in places you had never even noticed.  The point I am trying to make is that yes, in the South you might encounter racism. However, in the South they are more likely to tell you to your face that they don't like your kind. In the North, you will be objectified and exoticized indirectly, and in other ways that may end up feeling a 100x more offensive than some douche canoe saying crude words like 'towel head.' That kind of stupid name-calling can makes it easier to spot the ignorance. However, for a portion of the US that claims it's enlightened like MA, this place is racist as fuck. It takes even more work to tell when you're being fawned over because you're just 'different.'   Also yes, the south is closer to the typical value system in South Asian culture, but that is because it's conservative. That's the link. How conservatism manifests again is context dependent, but that's what the culture is. Yes, that means that conservative culture can have positive attributes like an emphasis on hospitality, preservation of cultural practices, and a rich religious tradition. The pitfall of being conservative for both S. Asians, South and many other places is that sometimes we don't know when to say, ""this tradition is outdated and oppressive,"" because then 'our roots' are supposedly at risk, and that always makes un-critical conservatives get all butt-hurt ."

ABCDesis,39726o,x6tance,3,Tue Jun 9 21:31:15 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thank you for your kind comment. Yes I agree that living in a city would help alleviate some of the isolation and latent discrimination I've felt here, it's easier for those vibes to be stronger when you hardly see people of color around you on a regular basis.   edit: I did want to mention though that I have a different set of problems with commonly exhibited traits of Northern culture in general. Referring to social demeanor, conceptions of privacy, and often a sense of 'ignoring' or being 'cold' to people around you. Southern hospitality does mean a lot to me. I think there is something very human about saying 'please', 'thank you', 'pardon me', 'excuse me', the simple act of moving out of the way to let someone pass, or smiling at someone kindly as they walk by you...which are completely amiss here (I hope that Boston is a bit less so). I guess some could say we're too 'nice' down South, but since when did being nice become a shitty thing? Some of the stereotypes however about the driving in the North are becoming less true. It seems that Georgia traffic (like any large city traffic-- especially if it wasn't built for this type of population influx) has become equally horrible. So, perhaps we will have our own version of Massholes in the South at some point, as soon as we can come up with a similarly catchy name for them. ;)"

I finally understood that reference once I started to watch that show in college and thought it was hilarious reference. But yeah no other major tragic stories. I dated a white girl pretty seriously in high school and her family was super nice to me. I also had a nice variety of ethnic and American friends. Few jokes here and there that got repetitive and boring but it was meh whatever. All that changed when I got to Ga Tech for college. Then somehow I exclusively started hanging out with brown people except occasionally going out with some of my American classmates.   So overall experience not bad.

(""I like you, you're nothing like the rest of them."") I haven't had many issues in larger cities; if I ever go on a road trip people will stare, but so far nothing explicit. And honestly it was worse when I was younger, I remember not getting invited to a birthday party that every other girl in the class was invited to because her parents were extremely conservative and at the time (post 9/11) it almost seemed reasonable to everyone. I don't think that would fly these days though."
ABCDesis,39726o,sindibindi,4,Tue Jun 9 23:21:45 2015 UTC,"At present, for Indians, Northern US and Southern US dont make as much of a difference as rural and urban locations.   You could go into rural illinois and drive through community after community with just white inhabitants and same with places like Alabama. But due to the 70s wave of indian doctors, even most rural communities know indians, and the racism is far lower than what blacks would experience.   Our culture(say respecting elders etc.) does not play much of a role in the racism debate  - it is often linked to a superiority complex, and few americans seem to have that with respect to Indians (for now)"
ABCDesis,39726o,zingbat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:03:42 2015 UTC,it is often linked to a superiority complex   I'm trying to understand this line from your comment. Can you clarify? Is it that Americans feel that Indians act superior or do Americans think that they're superior over Indians?  thanks
ABCDesis,39726o,Fuadius,2,Wed Jun 10 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Generally with regard to the racism seen in the US, whites think that they are much better than the blacks. The actual reasoning may or may not be true, but there is this underlying belief that blacks are not as good in numerous attributes. (education/ambition/intelligence... and on and on).   Since very few Indians immigrated to the US between 1930 and late 1960s, few americans ever bumped into one. Then suddenly during and after the vietnam war, you have this huge influx of indian doctors settling in rural communities.  In other words, the first indian a rural american probably met was a doctor. These doctors gave indians a very good reputation because in the US, doctors are assumed to be very smart and rich and very worthy of respect. So even now, in the US, indians are generally considered very educated and smart. (First doctors and then the software engineers led to this epiphany here).    You can contrast this with the UK where indians have been around for ages and most migration was family based. Indians there are like the Chinese in the US... they are there everywhere, but they dont get much respect."
ABCDesis,39726o,SabashChandraBose,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:16:39 2015 UTC,thanks for the clarification. That makes sense. I have seen increasingly positive stereotypes of Indians in the TVs/Movies in the past decade or so.
ABCDesis,39726o,Shopno,7,Wed Jun 10 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"""Most older white Southerners have negative assumptions about us, saying that we're terrorists, Satanists, etc.""  Well I gotta tell you. I'm from Long Island and the negative assumptions are here too."
ABCDesis,39726o,recycledpaper,3,Wed Jun 10 04:32:01 2015 UTC,"Nashville checking in. There are quite a handful of uncles and aunties around here (esp in the Franklin area), but definitely not as much as many other cities.   In the end, it depends on who you ask and how you compose yourself. Many of my native American (yeah, why not?) friends complain that desis tend to dress similar (they noticed the bushy mustache, the backpack atop the formal attire), the tendency to clump with other Indians, the heavy accent, etc.  But as with anything, your personality shows irrespective of your outer form. Some are friendlier, others are ""mean"" (until they discovered that it was a forced attempt at being noticed by being aggressive), etc.  I have never been the type to seek out like-skinned/languaged friends, and thus have friends who share my interests in boozing and my other passions. Nashville has a pretty eclectic crowd if you know where to look, and I have geographical clusters of friends that I hang out with (east side, midtown, west side, etc) and rarely have felt left out.  There is always the occasional asshole who goes, ""How do you get by TSA with that brown skin and beard?"" or ""Why are you at the pool? You don't need no tan"" and I'm always ready to spar with words at such people. But that comes part of the deal.  It also does help that I don't fit the stereotype in many ways."
ABCDesis,39726o,zingbat,4,Tue Jun 9 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"I am from NYC and moved to Louisiana for my masters. On the first day in dorm, I got paired up with a freshmen for some reason. His mother asked me if I go to church. I said no I don't. She asked why not. I said because I am not a christian. She said oh, we are gonna have to change that. Moved out of there and got placed into apartment style dorm. There were a few other experience I had while I was there. For instance, one lady asked me why Talibans are called that, what exactly are they banning.   That being said, I met plenty of people that goes against the notion that south is ignorant. In fact, I met one of my best friends there.   After graduating, I moved to a very liberal city (more like a town) in Texas for my PhD and I absolutely love it."
ABCDesis,39726o,bug-bear,4,Wed Jun 10 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"South Louisiana and I guess while I don't have ""in your face"" racism (no terrorist comments) there's more ignorant, yet offensive, comments. Like the nurse who recommended a book about an Indian orphan boy or an ex boyfriend's mother who didn't realize Indians can be Christians too (""well I had never thought about it but it does make sense now that you explain it""). And they think you know their Indian doctor.   Most people are overly nice and try to hide their disdain for Bobby Jindal lest they appear racist. I had a patient once ask me if I as related to him before saying ""I just wanted to make sure because I really hate that man"""
ABCDesis,39726o,bug-bear,4,Wed Jun 10 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Most older white Southerners have negative assumptions about us, saying that we're terrorists, Satanists, etc.   Not really and you painting with a pretty broad brush.  My job takes me all across the country and I've seen more of that in the North-East than anywhere else.  The problem is that the demographics you mentioned are low information people. They can't tell the difference between an Arab or an Indian. Most will think that India is in the middle-east.  But my experience is that conservative southerners can be quite hospitable once they get to know you. In fact, some of the nicest people I've met have been Southerners.  You'll always find a small group that is just down right hopeless despite spending time educating them on your ethnicity. I tend to not worry about them.   Also, desis have been in the deep south for decades. A large chunk of small to mid-size motels are owned by Gujus from Memphis all the way down to northern parts of Florida.  They've been there for years and have thrived."
ABCDesis,39726o,bug-bear,6,Wed Jun 10 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think I had mentioned this in another post. I live in the South (NC) and my husband is from the rural South.   Bigger cities in the South are mostly fine. Got bullied some right around 9/11, most people are open minded though (and educated). Rural south is a lot more closed-minded to anyone with any sort of dark skin. Southerners are super super polite - to your face. Behind your back, all sorts of shit will be said."

ABCDesis,3963vi,bigjince,10,Tue Jun 9 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"Your job is not your career. Most folks in our generation will have at least 4-5 jobs in their lifetime, if not more. Every single job is an opportunity to challenge yourself, build new skills, and grow your network. See it as a rung on the ladder towards self-exploration. Even if you have a shitty job right now, find a way to frame it as an opportunity, take what you can and move the fuck on. I highly suggest reading The Obstacle is the Way.  /u/kinsho mentioned that you should only work jobs you're passionate about - I don't agree with the ""only"" part, but I do agree with the underlying sentiment that you take jobs that you could find enjoyable even in the slightest. Even passionate jobs will have it's fair share of bullshit to wade through. Find yourself a job that you find interesting or somewhat enjoy. Know that it will most likely not be the last stop on your career journey - merely a stepping stone to something better later down the line. You'll learn what you like and don't like and you'll develop the skills to take you to the next job. The process will continue on and on.   Diversify your skill sets - learn personal finance, the basics of investing, develop your emotional EQ, learn how to communicate effectively and empathetically, develop your own personal interests and hobbies - all of these combined will give you a solid foundation for developing your personal life and professional career."
ABCDesis,3963vi,kinsho,5,Tue Jun 9 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I left out a bit of nuance in my terse comment. You're right, even the jobs you find great out there probably come with a fair amount of bullshit.  The key is though that you're passionate enough about the work you do to the point where you generally look forward to going to work each morning. On top of that, you should feel fulfilled doing the work you do.   Yes, you are right that eventually these feelings of passion will begin to dissipate. In that case, it may be time to look elsewhere - either upward or laterally. But all I wanted to get across is that at the very least, do not trap yourself into a job that you eventually end up hating. I've done that several times already. That shit takes a toll on you."
ABCDesis,3963vi,bigjince,2,Tue Jun 9 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"great elaboration.   Yeah if you end up at a job you not just dislike, but grow to hate - then that is a very very good indicator that you need to leave asap. It definitely will take a toll on you - not just in a professional sense, but the resentment will overflow into your daily life and relationships."
ABCDesis,3963vi,kinsho,4,Thu Jun 11 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"Tip: Only work jobs that you can be passionate about, even if only for a brief time. If you continue working a job you hate more and more with each passing day, then it won't be long before you'll start losing pieces of your soul here and there."

ABCDesis,3963vi,ohashish,6,Tue Jun 9 22:54:33 2015 UTC,So I'm a police officer and if you have any questions to ask fee free to ask.
ABCDesis,3963vi,hahaheehaha,4,Tue Jun 9 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"Whoa! Cool! I actually thought about being a cop for a bit, but back in CA only places like LAPD were hiring and even then they had a huge applicant list. Everywhere outside of that was mostly backlogged with applicants for the next 2 years. How long did it take you to finally become a cop?"
ABCDesis,3963vi,ohashish,3,Tue Jun 9 19:52:52 2015 UTC,I went to a Navy School for engineering(typical Indian) did a few years in the Navy and went straight to the police force. I tend to specialize in the tech section of our department but I've went on patrols too.  The length of time it takes to become a cop depends on where youu live. My area tends to be upper class and safe and because of that our policies in hiring and training police officers is strict.
ABCDesis,3963vi,hahaheehaha,2,Tue Jun 9 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"I really am envious of you. For us, the upper class areas had even longer backlogged list of applicants and you were really only going to get in from nepotism or a connection within the dept. I know a lot of people back home dropped out of trying to become a cop once they saw how long and extremely difficult it was to even just have a chance."
ABCDesis,3963vi,ohashish,2,Tue Jun 9 20:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the previous police chief went to the same Military school so that helped.  My dad was in the Singapore Armed Forces and has a decent amount of contacts in the U.S. that helped me out."
ABCDesis,3963vi,ComeAtMeBrosephine,6,Tue Jun 9 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"Tip to fresh college grads, or up and coming grads, people who want to study something after undergrad but don't know what to do (especially in social sciences and humanities): Grad school is not a shelter to run to when the shit-storm that is reality starts to confront your horizons. It is not a place to run to because you just want to know more about something with no reason/focus as to why. Grad school is hella expensive, it's time consuming, it's not well-paid (depending on your field-- but usually it's not), and it's rarely a cake walk. The most common conditions in which it is worth pursuing are: 1) if your job trajectory either calls for an advanced degree (and your employer is suggesting you should go back/you have enough real world experience to get into a good program; sometimes they will help you pay for it too) or you have taken some time to go into the work force (even if it's a year or so), gotten kicked around in the job market/worked shitty jobs and in the mean time you've had an honest discussion with someone in the field you hope to pursue or you've had hands-on experience as an intern or such in the field you want to go in to. You need to hear the GOOD and BAD aspects of what you're about to do. You'll be less likely to be disillusioned, and you'll be more strategic about WHAT you plan to focus on in grad school.   I can't count how many times I've had students come to my office and say ""Oh yeah I want to go to grad school! I think if I don't go to law school I will do my PhD."" While I think it's natural to consider your options, my initial questions as a doctoral student, undergraduate advisor, and instructor will be to ask: 1) What does that mean to you? To go to [insert name of degree/program], what does that degree do for you? 2) What do you imagine yourself working on with that degree? How does that particular degree offer some value added to your goals?   Every semester I have only 1-2 students that are able to give me a thoughtful response (not perfect but thoughtful; perfection isn't the aim here, it's critical thinking). It's very easy to spot students who use grad school as shelter. A Masters program may offer you the depth you want with out the pain of a PhD. However, don't let the Masters lure you in unless you need to be pursuing a PhD. Hell, part of my motivation was just to escape from reality, and as someone who has come this far I can say that if I didn't have at least 90% of my motivation be rooted in true intellectual curiosity or a career in teaching/research I would consider the past 6 years of my life a complete waste.   Also, my fellow ABCDesis...if you do want to pursue something that is in the social sciences/humanities/arts and feel forced to go towards the sciences...you know you're not alone. However, if you want to come to the other side...be strategic. I study Political Science, and while math isn't my strongest/most favorite subject...I focused my math training to statistics specifically b/c that is a key research method in my field. You can't RUN from the things you may not be the best at, you have to face them but know which monster you're willing to face and focus. It will make it much easier than to just run scared from it all. Now that I've studied stats and practiced it in my work, I am moving towards more interpretive and textual analysis. However I know when I go on the job market, I will have a resume/career experience with multiple methods of research, which allows me to apply to working in research jobs in DC (where data analysis/statistical modeling is king) but to also push back on the type of methods that are being used to be more innovative.  Anyways, I hope that helps anyone and if I have said something anyone disagrees with please remember this is limited to my experience in the social sciences and working at a large state institution with undergrads from a range of fields. I know that in many other fields this type of long tenure of study isn't as common, but I do know that they would agree it's not to be taken too lightly either way."

ABCDesis,393q61,touaregwanderlust,3,Tue Jun 9 01:14:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/oh-just-another-guy here. Back home I was expected to say thanks to whoever invited us, and thanks for the meal etc. I've always thanked auto rickshaw drivers/bus conductors and no one has said anything beyond ""you're welcome"". Yeah, my desi peers and friends will prob say ""wtf, you don't have to thank me"". These are my experiences in cities across 4 states in south India. I was a kid when I lived in the north but seeing as my parents are the ""please-thank you-sorry"" people to a fault, I'm guessing they did the same there too.  This article is written with a heavy north Indian bias and I fucking hate it that us south Indians get lumped in with that."
ABCDesis,393q61,i_am_not_sam,3,Tue Jun 9 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"This article is written with a heavy north Indian bias   That's very likely true. I am from Kerala, where I've never observed this anti-thank-you attitude."

These three things my dad brought up much later in my life, and said that as Indians we don't say these enough, and he remarked, ""In the US, they are very quick to express their inner feelings. I wish we were like that.""  I couldn't do it. It felt fake. I still cannot. Though the thanks part is now quite easy, the other two are still rare currencies I deal with. On the other hand, I have a few friends (all women) who use I'm sorry at times that I wouldn't. If I had a bad day, they'd say, ""I'm sorry."" I know what they mean (empathy), and don't question the point of it, but it feels very unreal when they use that word like that.  I love you tho fuggedaboudid! Bollywood has ruined that word for me. I never use it."

ABCDesis,393q61,b_digital,7,Wed Jun 10 01:55:47 2015 UTC,"I like that people say thank you in the U.S. because it is courteous. Maybe you don't need to say it to your uncle, but you can say it to rickshaw drivers, your watchman, shopkeeper, or such strangers you interact with daily. People you otherwise barely register. It makes me happy when someone smiles at me or thanks me or holds the door open for me - I know I don't mean much to them but the fact that they thought of me is nice. People in India tend to treat people of lower socio-economic classes than them kind of like shit - waiters, drivers, you name it. People expect everyone to bend over backwards in service especially. So I think saying thank you to people makes a difference. You don't have to make it empty - you can actually mean it. In the U.S. it's more of a habit, but it doesn't mean it's devoid of genuinity.   As for this person's uncle, I have no idea why he reacted with such disgust. My parents have people over all the time and both sides thank each other. They hug and laugh and stand at the door for a long time when guests start to leave, still chatting. They still thank each other - it's not a formality. Also how is a thank you unacceptable in the same culture that asks youngsters to touch the feet of their elders as they leave? Kind of ridiculous. Perhaps this author said ""thank you for inviting me"" in a lighter way than was appropriate for the occasion, even then I'd expect the uncle to laugh and say ""don't be silly"" rather than look disgusted, unless he's a stick in the mud."

But seriously, from interactions with my own family and their friends in India the usual response to my saying thank you is ""no need to say thank you"" or some type of mi-casa-es-su-casa response.   The implication is that what I consider formality they'd consider too formal; analogous to the canned responses that you'd use with strangers.   I'd agree that the author suggesting that his saying thank you to his uncle may have elicited something like disgust sounds over the top but in general there is truth to Americans using 'thank you' as a formalism to the point where if you actually wanted to show sincere gratitude to someone you'd have to say thank you and then some."

A story I'm now reminiscing on:  I was in a place one summer that's known for having very hot and humid (the humidity being the kicker here) summers. I would try to make sure to hydrate before running, but there was one especially bad day in the first 1-2 weeks I was there and I didn't drink enough water before. Anyway, around 7 miles into a 9 mile run, I felt my body just start to shut down and I had the hardest time moving my legs forward - my body wasn't cooling down because the sweat wasn't evaporating (humidity). I don't think I've ever felt that powerless feeling where the only thing I was trying to do was shuffle one leg in front of the other, and it seemed like an incredibly hard task even though I'd done it thousands of times of before.   While that was pretty rough, a few weeks later I ran ~14 miles over hills in similar very hot/humid conditions and while it wasn't great (I don't think it can ever be great when it's that hot/humid and the heat index is 100+), it was manageable.  tl,dr: It's hot (and maybe it's humid too!), but the heat just means you're alive!!!"

I can say yes if you're going to be out in the sun for more then five hours and if it's 30 plus degrees (Celsius) .   I'm not sure what's it like in say America but I know in Australia and the south pacific we have no ozone layer meaning our sun rays come at you with a vengeance of a mad max film. It depends on what you're doing ,how long you're out in the sun and what you're wearing."
ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,4,Mon Jun 8 09:16:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's quite correct to say that there's no ozone layer? It's just thinner than elsewhere, I think.

ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,3,Mon Jun 8 09:53:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the information.  Growing up in Pakistan, I never saw anyone put sun screen on but here in the UK, there are government funded skin cancer prevention campaigns running during summer that promote sun screen.  I always thought it was something that didn't apply to brown / dark people."
ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,2,Mon Jun 8 09:19:35 2015 UTC,"No worries, in school I grew up to a no hat no play rule (which I hated). Since primary school you're taught to put on sunscreen and wear a hat if you're going to be out in the sun, I think skin cancer is in our top three killer cancer list.   I guess skin cancer isn't as well researched there plus desis in general like staying out of the sun so they wouldn't see it as a big deal. I had no idea the UK had problems with skin cancer? I'm told that it gets up to the mid-high 20s and maybe a thirty on a really hot day and that's rarity.   It does we get dark in the sun as anyone else does and we get moles. That however takes twice as long, for instance my gf is white and her background is British whereas I'm Indian so in the summer when we're at the beach she may have to put on sunscreen twice everywhere on her body and that's 50 plus protection. Whereas I would put it on once and only once on my shoulders plus nose and I would be fine. However I'd like to advise you if you're going to the beach or somewhere warmer put on sunscreen as your body isn't adjusted to the hot sun and you will burn.  But generally I would advise put on sunscreen for long and extended use in the sun and if you're half naked. If you're going to a music festival you may tan but you'll be fine as long your clothes are on."
ABCDesis,3909x0,book-of-kells,3,Mon Jun 8 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"OK, I know I'm not the only desi 'allergic' to the sun...but are there any others here?

I'm really careful hence."
ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,2,Mon Jun 8 09:37:55 2015 UTC,"That's a sun burn. You burn more easily then others, I have a mate who is Korean and also believes he is allergic from the sun when it's actually a sun burn."
ABCDesis,3909x0,book-of-kells,2,Mon Jun 8 09:42:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, I had no idea that was a sun burn. I have gotten actual sunburns on my face (light ones, though). But the burn on my arm is not peeling? It is very itchy though. It is a bit red."
ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,2,Mon Jun 8 09:44:38 2015 UTC,You should put sunscreen and ointments on your arms. But yeah it's a sunburn some people call it sun rashes but those are more like from being in the sun as opposed to being in the sun in summer.
ABCDesis,3909x0,ShereOnFire,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:51:17 2015 UTC,Wow. So they got sun burnt in Austria? I wouldn't expect that.
ABCDesis,3909x0,pomegranita,4,Mon Jun 8 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"Yes! (Or maybe, it depends)  There are UVA rays (= A for aging) and UVB rays (= B for burning) and light skintones will burn easily while the pigment in deeper skintones do a better job protecting our skin from burning. The UVA rays do not cause burning, but wrinkles and pigmentation, hence the ""aging"", and people of color are affected by this even though it is not immediately visible. If maintaining young skin is a priority for you, sunscreen is crucial. (Most dermatologists say sunscreen is the only anti-aging skincare product.)  However, both UVA and UVB rays can harm our skin and can lead to skin cancer. I don't know the numbers, but it is less of an issue among people of color than among white people. However, when skin cancer occurs with people of color, it is a lot more dangerous/hard to treat than with white people.   So protecting your skin from the sun is important, just from a health point of view. UVA & UVB rays are even there when it's not sunny (I think partly because of our messed up ozon layer), so dermatologists also recommend applying sunscreen when it's rainy.   If you rarely go into the sun and live in the UK, you could consider only applying it from april to september when the sun is the strongest. /r/SkincareAddiction & /r/AsianBeauty have more info and product recs. There is also a sub specifically for the UK: /r/SkincareAddictionUK."
ABCDesis,3909x0,oinkyy,3,Tue Jun 9 11:29:38 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Do you get ruddy/pink when you're in the sun? Then you're getting burned, which is halfway to getting cancer. Put on sunscreen and prevent a possible serious health issue down the line."
ABCDesis,3909x0,Nylese,3,Mon Jun 8 09:20:17 2015 UTC,"If you go on /r/skincareaddiction you'll see the main reason they obsess over sunscreen there is to prevent the onset of wrinkles. For instance, this person was a truck driver. The left side of their face is from sun damage. Convincing enough?"
ABCDesis,3909x0,book-of-kells,2,Mon Jun 8 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"I am your neighbour across the small pond (not the big one :-)). Our weather is very similar to yours but we get more sun. I would still heavily recommend wearing sunscreen. The sun is quite harsh this far up north. I have been sunburnt a few times (am light brown). I wear factor 30+ regularly from April onwards.  A few things: just because you can't see the sun through the clouds doesn't mean the rays are not still strong. Two, you can't see the damage done now, but you will in a few decades.  I feel like there is so little awareness of sun protection among desis. When I was little and spent my holidays in India we never used to wear any  because the general wisdom was that brown-skinned people are immune to sun damage. We know now that's not true but my parents still refuse to wear sunscreen. I personally attribute my melasma (?) on my temples and forehead to the lack of sunscreen and hats in those days."
ABCDesis,3909x0,oneearth,2,Mon Jun 8 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"If you get one, which I recommend you do if you are out long, don't low ball; what you don't want is a rash or an allergic skin reaction. That's not a problem for most people, just FYI."
ABCDesis,3909x0,RotiRoll,2,Mon Jun 8 09:22:06 2015 UTC,"If you care about how your skin ages, YES.    You get residual UV radiation just by sitting by windows and commuting in cars. This is how I'm tanned even though I rarely go out in the sun and I've never been sunburned.   Also, even if you've never been burnt, it's not impossible for you to be sunburned if you go to a place with strong sun like Cancun or Florida or Australia and stay outside. My brother and father and cousin found this out the hard way.   Hats and light long sleeved shirts and pants are your friends.   ETA: Don't mess around with sunglasses either. I wear my sunglasses all the time now when I'm outside and it's bright since my dad had cataract surgery."

My worst burn was in Australia on a road trip where neither the car window nor my clothing nor my sunscreen were able to protect my skin adequately. Ever since then, I wear sunscreen whenever I'll be outside my home.   I also get moles easily and I hate how they look so there's an aesthetic consideration too."

ABCDesis,38zljp,confusedpresomething,5,Mon Jun 8 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"This is Australia. Indian doctors (well foreign doctors in general); despite having done their postgraduate training here, are still regarded poorly. Having an indian sounding name often means your CV is not taken seriously despite having trained in Australia.

ABCDesis,38zljp,bleedybutts,3,Mon Jun 8 05:46:15 2015 UTC,That sucks. I don't know if its racism or just the experiences Australian hospitals have had with foreign doctors. I hope its the latter.   Have you had any racist experiences in Australia growing up?
ABCDesis,38zljp,confusedpresomething,6,Mon Jun 8 05:49:21 2015 UTC,"Its a bit of both. There was that controversy recently about a Dr Death (Dr Patel) who caused a bunch of unnecessary deaths but obviously there is also the racial element as they were just looking at names rather than qualifications. Australia has a lot of issues with racism. Ive worked closely with Indigenous peoples on Indigenous health issues and frankly they have it so much worse that the odd racism I face doesnt faze me. If you stick to metropolitan cities then racism is not that big of a deal (no worse than what you would expect anywhere in the US). In rural towns though racism is quite strong. I originally wanted to work rural but having seen some of the inbred hicks there and how much distaste and disdain I had for my patients there I realised I needed to move back to the city or else I was going to get jaded with work. In the end though, having lived and worked in medicine in both the US and Australia, I would pick Australia hands down as the place to live the rest of my life. I consider myself Australian. Its sad though, these rural places are very disadvantaged with little access to healthcare. Various rural hospital recruiters come by and try and recruit us to their centres. They always target me given my past experience and they chuck a whole heap of financial and tax advantages onto their offers. I always knock them back given my experience with the people in rural towns. Such a bad taste in my mouth."

ABCDesis,38zljp,x6tance,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"Ive lived in Brisbane a lot and various rural NSW towns. Im currently based in Melbourne. I immigrated to aus as a boy. Did my medical training here. Did a US medical residency and then decided the US sucked so I went back to Australia. The reason I chose Australia is that it is more laid back than the US. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne feel very much like NYC but we dont have all the stress associated with living in america. We have a more egalitarian society and the weather here is absolutely brilliant. Also you can go for long drives through remote areas and see some beautiful sights that very few human eyes see. Everythings just simpler and easier. Health and education are taken care of. Its easy to invest and make money. Brilliant environemnt to raise kids in the future. Also doctors here work reasonable hours for good pay. The medical profession here recognises there is a life outside the hospital and we dont have to deal with bullshit private insurance companies if we dont want to. Its brilliant. Though, however, Im thinking of moving to NZL as its more in line with my lifestyle (skiing). i love australia so much mate; I actually get a bit tearful thinking about it ... which is kind of uncommon here given our lack of nationalism (unless you're a bogan).  I reckon its more common to see desis pursuing law because its easier to get into a law degree program (huge numbers of places and no extra exams to sit to get in). However the proportion of degree holders actually working in law as a lawyer is very slim."

And yeah. Law is quite saturated here as well, unfortunately. It became quite terrible after the recession.   I've been reading up alot on Australia lately (mostly Sydney, however), and I never realized how well taken care its citizens are. It almost makes me envious, lol! What gets me the most is that there's no emphasis on building credit, insurance companies, and how retail gets paid like a white collar job would here, lol! Seriously! It's bizarre. And you guys have some beautiful Unis in Melbourne and Sydney.   Here in America, we're always fed that we're the ""best"" Western country as a whole, but, when I read what it's like in Australia, I couldn't believe such a country exists. And it's weird to say that because I'm sure most people in a Western country don't think much about what life is like in another (unless you're romanticizing France/UK or something).   I'd argue on the weather, however, lol! Not sure what Brisbane is like, but compared to Melbourne or Sydney, I highly doubt it beats Southern California, especially San Diego. :p But according to my Dad, Perth has the best weather he's ever experienced in his whole life. And Cape Town is 2nd best. I wouldn't be surprised. All very similar climates.   I guess we do have quite the opportunities and what not, but, my views are more aligned with the Australian way of thinking. From my understanding, it's better to be poor (and maybe) middle class in Australia, but, it's better to be upper middle and rich in America. It's hard to compare America to Australia for me because I live in one of the better, more (most?) affluent state, so issues like health, life longevity, public education, etc aren't an issue compared to rest of the country. We almost live in a bubble here.  Anyways, I apologize for the rambling. I could see myself shifting to (Western) Sydney, but, it's hard to see myself elsewhere other than America. And even then, some parts of America. We'll see! :)"

ABCDesis,38yxmj,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"(These are just my opinions and my understanding of Gurbani)  Gurbani mentions fighting for righteousness until death in at least one shabad. There are numerous references to warriors throughout Gurbani. They are generally neutral references but at least, Gurbani acknowledges the existence of warriors who are disciples (Sikhs) of Waheguru. And if you go beyond the Guru Granth and look at Sikh history, you will see many examples.   At the same time, I concede that the wars over the past 15 years have been largely useless and causing a lot of death that could have been avoided and corruption which stole from the American middle class. And I agree that the dastaar has an important meaning.   I have yet to get anything near a convincing answer from anyone other than ""omggggg we'll be accepted, army is largest employer blah blah blah"".   I think that the US military still represents a noble idea. There is a lot to criticize about it, and Sikhs should be on the front lines of that criticism [1]. But there is also a lot to appreciate. When I said People today are just too disconnected from the realities of war., I meant it in the sense that the world is a messy place with no clear cut solution and the sacrifice of many good people (not only Americans). There are people in this country and in the military who are trying to improve the world for everyone. At least some people around the world absolutely rely on the US in terms of aid, non-sexy infrastructural support that you rarely hear about, and medication. Not many people or countries care or have the luxury to care about the shit going on in the rest of the world. And even fewer people are ready to roll up their sleeves and do the work.   It is disingenuous to reduce the conflicts today to ""killing Iraqi civilians"" and shows that you are either not aware of the complex nature of the world or are using sound bites to forward some narrow narrative.

ABCDesis,38yxmj,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:10:01 2015 UTC,"'picking up the sword' by the American state has not been in the name of any good.    You know that this is not an objective assessment. I might agree with you to some extent, but there is no clear cut ""good"" or ""bad"" in this situation. Because of that reason, I am not going to start blaming the soldiers.    The populations that rely on US aid do not rely primarily on the military.    The military is far more involved than you give it credit. And in general, the defense sector is responsible for the direction of the country's civil infrastructure and technology outlook for the subsequent decades (for better or for worse). And this has global ramifications in many other ways. Anyway, this is a much larger discussion.    most violent institution that human beings have run in this century.   You mean in the past 15 years? Sure, it's probably the most violent institution a group of human beings have run.   Iraq war is messy, I agree. The war will end one day. And we might find ourselves in a different war in the future, which might be just even from your standards. That's the reason why I don't want to conflate the issue of the Iraq war with Sikhs or anyone serving in the military if they wanted to. I am much more interested in long term rights than a war that will most likely end or take a drastically different form in the next few years.   Maybe I see this as a way of protecting Sikh interests.   I agree with you the voice is not strong enough. I wish there were more Sikhs in the US so that we could tackle more things at the same time. You will notice the Sikh panth in Canada is a lot more active when it comes to civil rights. Most of my cousins up north, including the AKJ type, have this trait.   This is one of the main reasons I continuously talk about developing and using the Sikh framework and bringing it to the mainstream in the US. The Sikh Coalition is not a spiritual organization. There is only so much you can do with lawsuits. American Sikh granthis, who can resurface the activist principles outlined in Gurbani are sorely needed to guide this panth."

Therefore, I do believe we should be as accommodating as possible for every group.   It doesn't even really interfere with the operations because Indian commandos have sikh soldiers who adhere to their headgear and perform just fine. ""Hijabis"" in the military are extremely rare considering women (of minorities) in general are rare in the military. And again, it doesn't affect anything. No modern day country has women in the front lines anyways.   Fun fact: As a women, you cannot join the Navy SEALS. :p  Burkhas aren't religious in nature. Also, hijab doesn't mean the headscarf.

And while Sikhs and Muslims have a common interest in being able to practice our faiths freely in this country, not all issues that Sikhs face are because of Islamophobia so I don't see the need to subsume one under the other."

We should use Gurbanic principles to show why xenophobia is bad. We have the same blueprint here that inspired 5 random people from across India to pledge and become the Panj Pyare. We have a diverse Sikh panth in America that should work in sharing Gurbani and explaining how bizarre xenophobia is in the Sikh framework. We should completely scrap the insulting ""we are not Muslims"" campaign the Sikhs launched after 9/11. By not using Gurbani in our approach, we are doing a disservice to ourselves, Muslims and any other marginalized minorities."

ABCDesis,38wua0,tinkthank,5,Sun Jun 7 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Some causes of allergies are idiopathic (in other words, we don't know why they happen), but genetic pre-disposition is also thought to play a role) as is your bodies inability to adapt to new conditions and environments. So you're not entirely wrong in saying that environment and exposure to different elements and the built immunity in India certainly plays a role in ""less prominent"" allergic reactions.  Also, allergies do exist in India as well, its just that the general public are ignorant to what to call them or think of them. Indians may not be allergic to certain things in India but are entirely allergic to them in the US or other countries.  For example, my dad thought he never had any sorts of allergies until he came to America where he found out he's allergic to pollen and some other stuff. Same thing with my uncle who found out he has allergic reactions to certain things that he never knew about while growing up in India.  As per the OPs view that allergies don't exist. I took some courses with medical students from India and allergies do exist in India, including allergic reactions to food. These are hallmarks of basic immunology that is taught in medical schools there as well, so this notion that it doesn't exist in India is entirely untrue."

Also, because there are so many people with serious infectious disease, people tend to not worry about diagnosing things like allergies/sensitivities. For example, a lot of lactose-intolerant people are identified as such here, but not in South Asia.  2) Hygiene hypothesis, which others have expounded, so I won't bother.  It's important to realize it's both, something my family is finding out the hard way. It turns out that we have family histories of ""Western"" diseases like autoimmune disease and mental illness, but it was all ignored and covered up. The joint pain was ""oh, bethaaaa,"" the fatigue was interpreted as genteel languor, and the mental illness a family secret in dark room."

ABCDesis,38wua0,nosupport,2,Sun Jun 7 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Medical care itself isn't that bad as is the reach of medical care towards poor in India.   Which is why I said ""average level."" And I mentioned it's both underdiagnosis and different sanitary conditions here.  Severe allergies are fairly rare in the US. They simply get a lot of publicity and we have awareness and public health measures in place for these people, unlike India. In the rest of the world, it's viewed as the patient's job to avoid allergens, not something covered by public policy.  Also, as I've found in my work with Indian child health, it's important to realize there are lots of mysterious illnesses and death in South Asia. There simply isn't the resources to figure out difficult cases. To some extent, we appear to have a lot of allergies because we diagnose a lot of allergies.  I have mild pollen and plant allergies. I know that it took a while (until my 20s) for them to be diagnosed here, because my desi parents didn't realize what was going on. They thought I was sickly and my itching myself was a ""bad habit."" I only figured out what was going on in the pre-college medical exam."
ABCDesis,38wua0,thebeautifulstruggle,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Same here. I only found out after college because my parents took me to an allergist. Before I was always just a wall shaking sneezer who constantly got colds (it made me very unpopular).   Screening counts for a lot too. I've worn glasses since I was six because a school exam caught me. My father didn't realize he needed glasses until his mid 30s because his eyes worked together to have 20/20. Consequently all of my childhood photos are blurry.   My cousin is off milk because her baby's pediatrician randomly tested her stool at a routine checkup and found microscopic bleeds. The baby wasn't in any distress at all. When she went back on, she noticed mild symptoms which I think many people would just ignore. So she doesn't drink milk anymore."
ABCDesis,38wua0,recycledpaper,2,Sun Jun 7 19:45:44 2015 UTC,It has to do with keeping kids in a sterile environment without exposure to allergens early in life. It's called the hygiene hypothesis.
ABCDesis,38wua0,x6tance,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"In medicine, the hygiene hypothesis is a hypothesis that states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents, symbiotic microorganisms (e.g. gut flora or probiotics), and parasites increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system. Hygiene hypothesis  Add in antibiotic abuse, diets of highly artificial and overly manufactured food products, and sedentary urban lifestyles and you have a lot factors that many recent migrants don't really have. I'm starting to see an uptick in allergies and various conditions in some folks born in the West and those of us born overseas and raised here.  Edit: words for clarity"
ABCDesis,38wua0,x6tance,2,Sun Jun 7 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"The running theory that I heard is that American urban kids' immune systems aren't exposed to as many ""threats"" (germs) because we've gotten better at sanitation. Their immune system basically goes into overdrive and starts attacking ""non threats"" (like peanuts) instead. This is why you don't see many allergies in kids who live in rural areas.   Strangely, I've seen more food allergies in young Indian children now than I did growing up. One of the kids here is allergic to nuts, dairy and eggs while many others are allergic to nuts only.   Side story: growing up my mother told me I was allergic to pet dander so I could never get a dog or cat. Turns out she lied because she just didn't want a pet."
ABCDesis,38wua0,flamegrl13,-1,Sun Jun 7 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"That is one weird theory.

Secondly, if someone is judging an entire culture by the poor fashion decisions of a few, then they're probably not a good person.

In any case, if we're comparing terrible fashion trends, westerners have no leg to stand on based on things like wearing socks with sandals, really high waisted pants, dresses or skirts over jeans, wearing multiple shirts with popped collars, saggy/droopy pants that show your underwear, leggings as pants, crocs, toms, rompers, I think you get the idea."

They struggle against popular representations as either threatening terrorists or geeky, effeminate computer geniuses. To combat such stereotypes, some use sports as a means of performing a distinctly American masculinity. Desi Hoop Dreams focuses on South Asian-only basketball leagues common in most major U.S. and Canadian cities, to show that basketball, for these South Asian American players is not simply a whimsical hobby, but a means to navigate and express their identities in 21st century America.  The participation of young men in basketball is one platform among many for performing South Asian American identity. South Asian-only leagues and tournaments become spaces in which to negotiate the relationships between masculinity, race, and nation. When faced with stereotypes that portray them as effeminate, players perform sporting feats on the court to represent themselves as athletic. And though they draw on black cultural styles, they carefully set themselves off from African American players, who are deemed “too aggressive.” Accordingly, the same categories of their own marginalization—masculinity, race, class, and sexuality—are those through which South Asian American men exclude women, queer masculinities, and working-class masculinities, along with other racialized masculinities, in their effort to lay claim to cultural citizenship.  One of the first works on masculinity formation and sport participation in South Asian American communities, Desi Hoop Dreams focuses on an American popular sport to analyze the dilemma of belonging within South Asian America in particular and in the U.S. in general."

ABCDesis,38sv2c,serenissima_regina,2,Sun Jun 7 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"I actually don't buy clothing generically named ""tribal"" at all. There was a good post on FFA a few months back by someone who gave guidelines on how to wear tribal (in the US, mostly Native American tribe-inspired) clothing without being appropriative, and the tl;dr of that post was that if you're buying it from a major national retailer, the garment is probably NOT based on research of a particular tribe and its art/a homage to anything."
ABCDesis,38sv2c,oinkyy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't either, partly because of the appropriation angle, partly because I very rarely wear prints.  But at the same time, I think it's worth re-appropriating the prints back, and preserving their history as much as possible. The interesting thing about ""tribal"" prints is that they're inspired by a much wider range of cultures than Native American - there's African, Central Asian, indigenous Australian, and Southeast Asian motifs in there too - and their identities get erased into ""vaguely Native American tribally stuff."""

Thrifting is so hard when you have a pretty set aesthetic in your wardrobe because so much of it is left to chance, but this website allows you to search for the items that you want!

I would like to move out at some point but my father is disabled. He has Parkinson's syndrome and my mom can't drive a car because she never learned so I will be taking care of them in someway for the rest of my life.  When I get married and move out, I would like to keep them close. I don't want to live under the same roof and I can't imagine a desi Muslim girl from my generation agreeing to that either."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,recycledpaper,18,Fri Jun 5 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"As a Desi Muslim girl of this generation, I would be appalled and refuse to marry you if you told me you were going to abandon your father with Parkinson's. If you have the ability to take care of him yourself, I fully expect you to do so, and I expect myself to help. If his condition cannot be taken care of at home, I expect you to put him in the best cat possible (nurse living at home with him or a nursing home) with regular, at least weekly, visits from the both of us.  That being said, what if your parents are just old, with nothing as severe as Parkinson's? I would still want to live with your parents as long as they weren't meddlesome in our lives. We are adults, and should be treated as such. If this is impossible, I would still want to live as close to them as possible.  Desi Muslim girls are not a monolith, do not treat us as such."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,TeslaModelE,17,Sat Jun 6 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment in principle. Personally, I know that we will have one or both sets of parents living with us, if they become ill.  At the same time, it's important to understand why people find caregiving difficult, especially of in-laws with whom they don't have a strong bond. I wouldn't immediately rush to accuse them of ""abandonment.""  Caregiving is difficult - it's difficult, dirty, heavy, smelly, and expensive. People forget that there's colostomy bags, and bedpans, that disabled people have to be physically carried. People with mental problem can get violent and destructive or themselves and others. Chronic pain and disability rarely improves a person's personality, and it's very easy for a housebound person to become ""meddlesome.""  Medical bills near the end of life skyrocket in cost, and unfortunately they compete with paying for children's health and education. Unfortunately, there is a wrenching choice about elderly parents' care and quality of life for the rest of the family.  Caregiving, especially the physical care and emotional care, overwhelmingly falls on wives. Some women do find this challenge something they are suited for, but some do not. It takes an incredible amount of resilience to care for suffering people."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,book-of-kells,11,Sat Jun 6 04:33:15 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head. Regular visits can help ensure your family members get quality head care and eventually being overwhelmed by the situation can be too much for any caregiver.   I think most people would want their parents to be as independent as possible. I think this is why my parents chose not to bring their parents to the States. They would have to rely on us to live normally.
ABCDesis,38qe0a,TeslaModelE,7,Sat Jun 6 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"I made his condition sound a lot worse than it is but he's always had this habit of being dependent on my mom or someone. He's one of those brown dads. We came to America 1988 and I don't think you learned how to use a microwave until 1999.  His days are spent watching cricket, sa re ga ma pa, and Desi soap operas. I'm open to living with them, of course, but I've never lived alone and for once would like the freedom and privacy that comes with it.   I will take care of them no matter what :)"

He was also incredibly weak and bedridden and his daughter-in-law had to face the majority of the burden while her own husband was disabled (w/ Parkinson's no less)."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,trctn4238934,5,Sat Jun 6 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can relate to this a bit.

ABCDesis,38qe0a,ComeAtMeBrosephine,12,Sat Jun 6 01:27:58 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate.     They also have no social life and like to micromanage my life.   This is probably a major factor.  My parents never had any illusions about me continuing to live with them, and a lot of this probably has to do with the fact that there is a large Desi community in my hometown, and my parents have a pretty good social life and a large circle of friends. Their social interactions do not, and have never, been about me.  While it might be a colossal task, it might be worth it to try to get your parents in some local clubs or social groups, and help them make friends and join social circles so that you are not their only means of social interaction."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,Nylese,3,Sat Jun 6 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"Try to get your parents in some local clubs or social groups   I tried, am still trying, and will keep trying. I continually try to persuade them to go to Swadhyay meetings, go to weddings they are invited to, dinners, etc. But they just don't.   Their lack of a social life has really affected me psychologically, and now I feel guilty everytime I go out or try to make friends. Hell, during my first year in college, I was at a party and couldn't even finish my drink because of how bad I felt. I ended up leaving the party only after 10 minutes."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,srs507,11,Sat Jun 6 23:42:20 2015 UTC,You don't have to stay in the same house. Your parents probably just want to stay close to you. They probably won't take it badly if you stay 15 or 30 minutes away from them.

But I intend on doing so after paying off their mortgage so I can use that as leverage.   Plus, ironically enough, my father has lived independently from his parents since he was 27. He moved out when he was 27 while still living in India. But he loves to hold all these double standards with me."

I'm doing finance/accounting/econ, working, and then moving to NY for grad school. I'm just done."
ABCDesis,38qe0a,Buzzin2015,6,Sat Jun 6 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"That is a difficult situation OP however I agree that an honest dialogue when you are financially and mentally ready will help. Internally panicking will only let it fester and eat away at you, so brain storm some plans that could account for their primary needs and yours. You can then plan your future goals around that. Close friends are a great resource, people who you can trust to give you advice that will respect your parents as well as your wishes. Remember, they may not be completely happy with your decision, but you're not a martyr. You're their son not a retirement fund, you take care of them because you love them not b/c it's an obligation. Living 15 mins away from them isn't the end of the world if they are still able to care for themselves. No time will ever seem like the right time to bring it up, but it will save you both a lot of grief and resentment in the long run.   Just another thought, it seems that one common reason Desi parents are talked about in the sub is due to a decision/choice/goal/rule/behavior that was placed upon the offspring but they were never consulted regarding what our own feelings are on the issue. It's just presumed. That lack of agency that comes in the encased in a knotted ball of 'culture' and 'tradition' is deeply painful for anyone to navigate, be it male or female. Honestly, I think that the burden that falls on the shoulders of male-progeny to carry their parents is as presumptuous and hurtful as when it is presumed that their daughters will consent to an arranged/semi-arranged marriage. Personally I think that this is the other face patriarchal culture that is equally difficult on males. I don't know if your specific context is along these lines, but as someone who has watched her own brother lovingly take care of our parents I know that in many ways he also had no choice. OP, would your parents expect the same if they only had daughters instead of sons? What would be their plan then?   Sadly, part of why I continued to push myself through school and go on to grad school for which I had to move away, is to not fall in to the same cycle. However, I noticed my brother didn't get that opportunity to step way or rebel the way I did. He was the oldest and it was indirectly his 'duty.' He would never want my parents to leave, but there are plenty of times he wishes he had control over more things in his life. I can actively sense in our conversations how disempowered it makes him feel at times. There has been progress in some ways, they have learned to express their problems and make adjustments, but I know that it is a constant cycle of learning to accommodate one another. I wish you luck OP, know that it's easier to be honest earlier and manage some hurt feelings with time, than to make promises you will come to resent them for."

Up until now, I had been really passionate about studying medicine but I recently realized the degree of stress this would entail considering my family's financial condition and how the onus is on me to help them. I'm now in the process of picking another career and my heart leads me to fields where I can do well and go to graduate school in a different city just so I can get away from them.   I completely empathize with your older brother, speaking as the youngest child in the family. The oldest is my sister who my parents don't intend to rely on at all even though she is a pharmacist and plan to marry off soon. I'm their lifeline and longterm investment.   I once even asked my dad, after learning about 401k and retirement savings, if he had one. He literally told me that I'm his retirement savings.   I just hope I have the strength to deal with his sadness once he finds out what my plans really are. I really love my parents but I aspire to travel, study in a different city, study abroad (perhaps), date, go clubbing, drink, etc. I just want to be free.

While his points are largely made based on anecdotal evidence with some studies worked in, the insight he provides is more about an attitude than about being statistically ""correct."" He's basically asking, what if finding a partner in life is not this big deal that should require years of dating, multiple partners, and everything in its right place? We don't make friends that way, we love our families even though we literally didn't have any choice in the matter, and we often make so many great decisions in our life without thinking that much about them. There are exceptions, of course, and he's not saying that everyone should just get an arranged marriage, but maybe things are just getting too extreme in the opposite direction. I think the problem is that our generation finds itself squarely in a position where we want to make all our decisions, and though we take pride in it (as we should), we sometimes don't have the balls to actually make some of these decisions. This leads us to try and maximize/optimize our pool based on largely irrelevant factors (ie: we don't actually KNOW what kind of characteristics in a girl/guy are good for us) rather than learning to appreciate the opportunities we actually get and make the best of them."

ABCDesis,38nys3,_blend_,8,Fri Jun 5 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"Well, the majority of Indian origin stand-up comics in the US/Canada thrive on the basis of their ability to accurately (and sometimes inaccurately) portray the Indian accent. So for some reason, it is considered funny.   Another example. Kunal Nayyar (not an ABCD, born in London, raised in New Delhi until he finished high school) has a thicker accent when he portrays Raj than when he's on TV shows. In fact, if Raj loses his accent, he'd probably not have much value in that sitcom (from a comedy standpoint)."

ABCDesis,38nys3,CantankerousCaveBear,7,Fri Jun 5 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"This is my pet bugbear.  I came to the US when I was 21, having baked my English accent by then. I was conscious and actively tried to speak ""American"", but then I figured that my brain was switching back and forth between some words, especially, can't. Even today I pronounce it the British way, because the American pronunciation of cant can mean something ""insincere talk, esp concerning religion or morals; pious platitudes"".  After many years, I figured, ""Fuck it! I'm going to speak what comes naturally to me,"" and reverted to my British-Indian accent, while trying my best to neutralize the heavy emphasis on many syllables.  Of course, I quickly learnt that ""wine"" and ""vine"" were pronounced different (just as ""wedgie"" and ""veggie""). The more I resolved these little issues, the more I learnt that the single biggest problem is with the ""rr"" syllable. I cannot, I just cannot, pronounce words like, say, ""car"", the way Americans do without emphasizing it so much that I sound like an Arab guy trying to act chill.  During my MS days, I had a bunch of Chinese labmates, and their English was, relatively, worse than mine. But I remember paying attention to their words, deducing important ones in their sentence, and then extrapolating and inferring what they were trying to say. I quickly learnt to do this with everyone, even with people who speak with a thick Southern accent. I don't sometimes understand every word, but I get the gist.  And this is something that boggles my mind with many of my American friends. I once was talking to my friend about Korea. I pronounced it as ko-rea (sorry if this doesn't make sense). And with a straight face asked me, ""Where is Ko-rea?"" I repeated, ""Well, you know, North and South Korea."" And she shook her head. I was confused. I had never been asked to repeat Korea. Her husband is S. African, and he speaks with a thicker African accent. He repeated it, and she said, ""Oh! Koh-rhea,"" and I sat there flabbergasted.  it's times like these that I wish I could scrub my accent clean, but then again, it's not my fault I speak 4 languages! My theory is that many Indian languages employ lingual gymnastics (ever tried to pronounce banana in Tamil) that gives the speaker a possession of a superset of sounds than the native English speaker, and sadly, this gives the much maligned ""Indian accent""!"
ABCDesis,38nys3,x6tance,3,Fri Jun 5 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the v vs w still bites me hard at times. It's difficult if you've spoken a lot of English in India before you moved here, because you are so used to it.

I was only up for maybe 10 seconds, and haven't quite been able to do it since, but I'm getting there.  I'll also share why I was able to finally do it, because it's an example of how yoga connects body, mind, and (if you believe) spirit:  I'd made progress to about halfway up the pose, but was stuck there for months.  About two weeks ago, my teacher was walking around giving instruction and he said something that for some reason hit me like a thunderbolt:  ""The important thing is to put your heart above your head.""  All in one moment, a bunch of things connected: I'd lived the past ten years or so with my head above my heart.  By that I mean I was living according to what my head was telling me to do, and often ignoring my heart.  Now, this served me well at that time: I set aside a lot of things that pleased my heart in the past, got serious, started my business, did well, established myself financially, etc.    But now my life is entering a new phase, one that needs my heart to lead and my head to follow, and so that old way of being wasn't working anymore.  Yet I clung to it.  And so that manifested in getting stuck with the headstand because I wasn't willing to put my heart above my head.  This all came to me in just one flash, because immediately I said to myself: ""It's OK, let your heart go above your head...""  And while that day I didn't go all the way up, I finally made it past the point I'd been stuck on all this time.  I broke through.  A few times after that I'd keep saying to myself: ""It's OK.  Trust.  Let your heart go above your head...""  Each time I made some micro-progress (which I've learned is sometimes where the major progress actually lies).  And then finally on Tuesday, I went all the way up.  Like I said, I haven't been able to repeat it yet; but I know that I'll be able to do it consistently soon.  It's also reassured me that the things I'm doing in other areas of my life, where I am beginning to put my heart above my head, will likewise turn out to be far less scary--and far more rewarding--than I thought."

Pretty good stuff. I see a fair number of desis in there every time I go there.  To answer your question though, personal experience and anecdotal evidence tells me non-desi folk wouldn't really come to these places in droves. You can have ethnic fast-food restaurants like Panda Express because America has always had a strange liking to Chinese food. Probably in part because Chinese people really Americanized their cuisine so that the hole-in-the-wall restaurants they opened can stay in business. It's hard to Americanize Indian cuisine when the heart and soul of Indian cooking lies in the spices that a lot of white folk seem to have trouble tolerating."

ABCDesis,38iwbj,strong_scalp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:48:44 2015 UTC,its not fast food though.
ABCDesis,38iwbj,Yieldway17,2,Thu Jun 4 22:29:00 2015 UTC,There's actually one or two desi fast food places in the Charlotte area. I think they do slowly start to pop up in places with a high concentration of recent immigrants. The quality's only so-so I've heard.
ABCDesis,38iwbj,flamegrl13,2,Thu Jun 4 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, even if any chain opened up, it would be north Indian food. Even non-desis I know who like Indian food rarely go for south Indian, unless they're vegetarian.  I mean there is also good non-veg south Indian food but it's rare even in Little India type neighborhoods.   But more than that I think the demand is really small.  The average American is not that interested in Indian food. Speaking anecdotally, there are a few reasons that I've heard.     I don't like spicy food: anyone who's eaten at an Indian restaurant knows the food can't be called spicy at all (in general). Mexican (or Tex-Mex) food is popular because it features things that Americans are familiar with: meat and cheese. ""Spices"" mainly consist of peppers and can be taken out if the customer doesn't want them, so it ends up not being that spicy at all. Chinese food in America is nothing like Chinese food in China - it's been heavily modified for American tastes. And a lot of Chinese dishes are not spicy either.   Even if it tastes good, I don't like the smell: even people who don't know what ""curry"" smells like sometimes say this. I guess there is some merit to this - you don't want to work in an office environment where you're constantly smelling food, even if it does smell good.  But going to an Indian restaurant doesn't leave you smelling like food.  There are also people who say it smells too strong - if it becomes more popular they may get used to it, but I think it'll always be there. Like people who can't eat seafood because of the smell.  I only eat American food:  There is a larger contingent than you might think of people who really don't eat anything outside of steak, hamburgers, or pasta.     I have been seeing Chipotle-style Middle Eastern places popping up (ex. Olive Mediterranean Grill).  I think once these become more popular, people may be more interested in Indian fast food.  Middle Eastern food, while still being different, introduces people to a wider range of spices and types of dishes (rice, grilled meat, chickpeas, eggplant, etc.)."
ABCDesis,38iwbj,HeroHiraLal,3,Fri Jun 5 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, the average American seems to be divided into two camps - those who cannot handle spicy food at all, and those who can eat incredibly spicy food (more than I can handle) without breaking a sweat. There doesn't really seem to be a middle ground.  Off-topic: I'm very unhappy that Olive Mediterranean Grill discontinued their couscous and decided to serve freekeh instead."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,canadiandesiinusa,25,Thu Jun 4 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I think he's drawing some really broad conclusions based on race: ""non-white = social and friendly,"" ""white = uptight and racist.""  It doesn't even begin to touch on many subtleties, such as that a lot of these interactions are about class, not race. In my experience people do reach out across racial boundaries, but usually within their social class.  Or that there's a lot of racism within ethnic communities, whether it's desi-on-black racism, or casteism or religious hatred or skin color."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,serenissima_regina,4,Thu Jun 4 19:17:42 2015 UTC,Agreed. This article is just fiction.

ABCDesis,38jsfw,serenissima_regina,2,Fri Jun 5 02:48:48 2015 UTC,That's the exact opposite of the experiences people have told me. Just goes to show how it's all bullshit
ABCDesis,38jsfw,asdfioho,5,Fri Jun 5 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"As a neighborhood becomes more desi, it becomes littered with more garbage, lawns are increasingly left unkempt, cars are parked on lawns, loud bhangra music is blaring, pungent odors linger, etc. Eventually, in places like Brampton, even the signs on shops and such nearby start being put up in Punjabi only. Folks who haven't lived it will think I'm dead wrong  ....  All of us Indo-Canadians growing up in ethnic enclaves in Mississauga and Brampton dreamed of eventually living in Toronto downtown, where it is actually multicultural and diverse.    I think you're wrong and I've lived in these areas. I like my neighbourhood, I like my neighbours and I haven't encountered most of the problems you mention. Granted the traffic sucks and there is litter in spring when the snow melts... but the lawns are fine, the odour is fine, the cars are on driveways, the signs have English and I don't hear much bhangra outside of weddings.   And I like it here. I would not want to move to downtown TO. So your experience is far from representing ""all of us"" if you're talking about Indo-Canadians.   This author's portrayal of these neighborhoods is laughably stupid. How do those desi people behave towards non-desis in the desi enclaves? Even worse, how do the desis behave toward other desis from other regions of the subcontinent?   I haven't had many issues with that either. There was an incident when some kids decided to chase my dad on his way home from work and yell racist things... but it's been mostly okay. Yeah, all of my immediate neighbours are ""brown."" But we're not a homogenous group. Different religions, different regions, different languages. Not everyone is desi. We get along okay. My group of friends in high school was like that too.   I do think original article has a lot of issues and certainly Brampton does as well. But it's also frustrating to see people put down this city like it's an objectively bad place to live. If your experience was bad, that's valid. But it's far from universal."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,fullagain,3,Fri Jun 5 06:47:47 2015 UTC,"I live in Mississauga and have lived in Brampton. Are there issues? Yeah, there are. It's not like OP describes though, at all. Even on the all-desi street I lived on in Brampton - everyone had nice well-kempt lawns and didn't park their cars all over the place.   I don't deny that's there are areas where what OP says is the case - but that's probably in the lower income areas of Brampton (think Steeles from Hurontario to Bramalea) where it's less a function of ethnicity and more of class and income."

ABCDesis,38jsfw,Lola1479,3,Thu Jun 4 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"Dunno about Indian-Canadians, but US Census data places Indian-Americans as the highest earning ethnic group.   1 Indian American: $86,135  20 Sri Lankan American: $65,606  47 Pakistani American: $61,279  112 Burmese American: $47,259  116 Nepalese American: $46,351  117 Bangladeshi American: $46,157   In contrast, the median household income for the total population is $51,914, with white Americans having a median annual household income of $54,857.  I think it's important to note that though people of South Asian ancestry are seen as this ""model minority"" with incredible earnings potential, that number is skewed heavily by Indian, Sri Lankan and Pakistani Americans. There are large Desi populations in the US who do not fit this ""high earner"" stereotype.  Not all Desis are created equal.  Source."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,GWmyc2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:55:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I really don't have enough Canadian data to compare this too.

Sometimes this sub leaves me the sense that some subscribers don't think much of Sikhs or Punjabi people."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,Lola1479,2,Fri Jun 5 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Punjabi here - I've never felt that way in my lurking, what makes you feel like that?  Also, I wouldn't read too much into housing prices in the GTA. They're massively overinflated, in my opinion. I know quite a few desis who put 5% down and are just barely managing the mortgage payments. I shudder to think what'll happen when interest rates rise."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,BONER_Q_EINSTEIN,2,Fri Jun 5 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe its just me. I just seem to see a lot of descriptions of Punjabi immigrants as poor and uneducated. They may come here uneducated and poor but they work damn hard. And they may gravitate towards their community as a safety net but their kids integrate just fine. That is how immigration works! Yea the housing prices are not indicative of much but we are not living in slums.  And calling Sikhs ""Khalastanis"" to try to incite negative feelings just disgusts me."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,Lola1479,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed with your first paragraph. I'll add though that it seems as though the Punjabi community in Canada faces a number of unique issues that other desi communities don't in the same way. I think there's a kernel of truth to what gets says sometimes, but perhaps not to the extent that it gets played up.  I wouldn't sweat the one guy calling us 'Khalistanis' - that's probably the first time I've ever seen the term used on the sub TBH. Stupid as it may be. I've lived in Canada all my life and I've heard Khalistani talk a handful of times in my entire life. Characterizing all Punjabi Sikhs as such is some dumb shit."

No, not a huge amount of Canadian Desis are poor compared to the general population.  Most uneducated and blue collar Desis here have managed to create a decent living for themselves after years of hard work.  I've seen the difference in average education level and employment-type between Americans and Canadians parroted a lot here, but its really important to note that low education, blue collar work does not equal being poor.  For example, most Indo-Canadian cab drivers and truckers have carved out a middle class lifestyle for their families."
ABCDesis,38jsfw,GWmyc2,2,Fri Jun 5 00:16:07 2015 UTC,"Mentioned this in another thread. Worth repeating here.   Why do ethnic enclaves exist in the first place? Most neighborhoods in Toronto started out as white and quickly morphed into ethnic enclaves. It's because (Anglo) whites all moved out when minorities reach a critical mass. If not for white flight, we'd see a more equitable distribution of minorities spread out across all neighborhoods.  For a minority to truly integrate requires social acceptance on behalf of the majority. This extends beyond superficial pleasantries and ""lawn and weather"" small talk. It involves white people living in your neighborhoods (and staying put even if colored faces pop up), extending friendships, inviting you into their own homes and their parties, and to be willing to date you (a survey revealed 7/10 of white women have a racial preference in dating, of which 95% excluded Indian men).  Perhaps Desis realized that no matter how hard they try they'll never receive true social acceptance, and retreated into the comfort of enclaves with their own communities as a result?"
ABCDesis,38jsfw,DreamCatcher24,4,Fri Jun 5 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"Enclaves form because it's where recent immigrants can seek out familiar culture and language and religion and food. It's somewhere where you can worship with other people, have your children learn your mother tongue, your elderly parents have other people to socialize with, your takeout dinner to taste authentic. Something that has nothing to do with racism from white people.   Perhaps Desis realized that no matter how hard they try they'll never receive true social acceptance, and retreated into the comfort of enclaves with their own communities as a result?   I don't know where you live, but there's plenty of social acceptance of desis along certain class lines. Not to defend being classist, but I just don't see that desis or Asians are particularly shunned in society more than white people. A lot of what you're talking about applies to black people, but not Asians. Yes, you have somewhat of a point about dating, but that's about the extent."

Apply and transfer to a community college like Langara, work hard enough and get A's, and then apply to engineering school. If you already got accepted into university but in a different faculty, you can also take the necessary subjects you need to transfer into engineering (though you'll need to work even harder).

Seriously, in addition to the usual foreseeable problems, you'll have other problems that you haven't thought of. If you apply for a job, a lot of documents like Social Security, employment docs etc. will need an address to be posted. You will not be able to shower regularly enough to appear clean-cut enough for interviews. Even at a minimum wage job, appearing clean and hygienic is important. Buying every meal, as opposed to heating up frozen meals, is going to be far more expensive.  Instead, get a friend to take you in for a few days and look for a minimum wage job that will be enough to pay your rent and food.  Since you will be new to living on your own, I suggest only concentrating on working full 40 hours on the minimum wage job and getting used to your new living situation.  Your grades in programming are good. After a few months, apply to your local community college for a programmer's certificate program. Computer Science might need math and a college degree but programming doesn't. A 2-year associates degree goes a long way in programming.  Don't get stuck in minimum wage job. It's great for time being but as soon as you get a foothold in community college, look for better jobs. If you stick to programming, that's good. Even otherwise, keep looking for office jobs etc. Even if it hurts your ego, try asking as many people for help as you possibly can. That's easier said than done but it's really, really important that you do this when starting out. Like I mentioned, go for a programmer's degree. I don't know if you like it but you are obviously pretty good at it. It gives the best return on investment and you will earn enough initially to change your path later on if you want. And don't be homeless. It's far more hassle than it's worth.   Good luck! You are taking a bold step. Don't let your family's traditional programming get you down."

A lot of social workers who go to India to work in slums are surprised by the lack of teen pregnancies before being reminded that while condoms and IUDs have been popularised by the government for quite some time, cheap and easy access to abortion in government hospitals helps prevent a lot of unwanted pregnancies from contributing to an already bad economic situation."
ABCDesis,38ft71,akbar-great_chai-tea,2,Thu Jun 4 00:05:33 2015 UTC,In India the average age of first delivery is a teenage pregnancy. The problem is that this is considered normal and that they are unofficially married so its more socially acceptable.

So they are socially married.   It isn't the safety net, it's the fact that it is extremely unhealthy for the girls and their kids. Even if there was a safety net in the west for underage girls having kids WHICH there is (Since the government has programs to help out) the education and social pressure is to have children later."
ABCDesis,38ft71,Anandya,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"India doesn't have mandatory marriage registration. Religious ceremonies are legally valid marriages.   Underage marriages are technically illegal but there is no punishment for breaking the law. Courts do prosecute the parents sometimes if there is a hint that the marriage is a forced one but otherwise, there is no legal punitive measure for underage marriages.   Everything you say about teenage pregnancies is true and I am not disputing that. But the marriages are perfectly legal. India considers marriage a social and religious contract as opposed to a legal contract with the state like in the US."

I grew up in VERY racist areas with very clear racial / socio-economic segregation.  One of my family members was in academia and was denied tenure due to specifically racism from one of my best friend's father who was also in the university in a separate department.  Many of the students were so angry that they went to the Provost and President about my family being thrown out of the university.  To date, the racism I've felt and experienced from many of my classmates parents and families, I can't describe to you whenever I would go to their homes.  When growing up, there were clear areas I was told by our close white friends that I shouldn't go.  If I went into those towns with a white girlfriend it was VERY well known that they would pull me over, take the girl out of my car and tie me on the back of a truck and drag me through a field and lock me in jail for a week before I get my first phone call or let go. To ""teach me a lesson"" that I shouldn't take one of their ""white"" girls  Fast Track later, I went a portion of my schooling in a very redneck area of the south.

Imagine if you saw a picture of a wedding gown you liked and sent it to your non-desi friend saying ""Can't wait to see you wear one of these at your wedding"" - pretty sure they would get kind of pissed off unless they were actually planning their wedding at that time. But people think this kind of attitude is somehow acceptable for desi weddings? Even my own family is somewhat guilty of this. One of my uncles brought up my future wedding a few years ago before my own parents did, saying he just wanted me to get married so then my cousins could get married and he could attend everyone's weddings. My (at the time, ~14 yo) cousin wanted me to get married so she could eat chocolate cake, and then followed up by saying she would bring the chocolate cake herself if I committed the oversight of having some other cake. It's really irritating when other people treat an event that will affect you for the rest of your life as something for their own entertainment.

Edit: I also don't think this is specific to desi weddings. This is across all cultures. To summarize what I'm trying to say - a wedding is about the couple, their marriage, their families.

ABCDesis,38e86k,serenissima_regina,5,Thu Jun 4 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"When is a language dead? One could argue that since there are no native speakers being born Latin is pretty much 'dead'. Source: I'm a classicist, pretty much all classicists I know think that Latin definitely can't be classified as alive, most consider it 'dead'.   And I'd argue that adapting/absorbing influences from other languages is one of the things that classifies a language as 'alive', and that has not been the case for a very, very long time with Sanskrit and Latin."

ABCDesis,38e86k,teethandteeth,5,Wed Jun 3 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"I see. My Latin teacher insisted that we understand Latin as ""unused"" rather than ""dead"", probably because of the bad connotation of the word ""dead"" and its conflation with language extinction.   After all, we know everything about how Latin is spoken and written, many people around the world do speak it, and it is even used in liturgy and official Vatican documents. The only thing is that nobody speaks it as an L1 anymore. If we're going to use metaphors from human life, it strikes me as sort of like being retired, rather than dead.  Furthermore, neither Latin nor Sanskrit ever actually lost its last native speaker, which is the official definition of language death. Both languages developed over time into different dialects that became different languages. I believe linguists call this ""linguistic pseudodeath""."

E.g: Civil Rights movement created south Asian America.   If you say that the civil rights movement created the South Asian America, then you could just as well credit the movement with creating Italian America (and every other '-america' except for the Brits, Germans & the Irish).   The 1965 act had no backing from the black population at that time, and while the issue may have gotten a push when framed within the  civil rights context, the law itself seems to have passed due to numerous reasons which were much more compelling than civil rights/equality.    I am also unsure why linking indians with blacks is so important. African Americans go through so much, and have struggled (and are struggling so much) to get their rights, while indians are probably second only to jews in terms of economically & politically powerful minorities in the US."

There are some larger firms (Technip USA is a known one) where there is a known [notorious] desi mafia where they only help each other based upon schools, religions, castes, language groups, villages/districts they are from etc. etc. etc.    With that said, some places there are a notorious screening for ""indian"" sounding names because they assume you need sponsorship.  The REAL reason though is honestly getting your resume to have the right keywords to bypass the HR computer systems screening process.  If there is one open job position, I guarantee you over 1200 job applicants to it.  They utilize silly algorithms to filters through the resumes to look for specific keywords.  THEN a HR person maybe has 30-50 resumes and spends 8 seconds glancing to see if they want to pursue or not.

Yes, companies do that, not because of racism, but because many people are lazy and rude. Employers hold the cards, so they can afford to be jerks. I deplore this practice and discourage it whenever I can.  Frankly, there's not a lot of anti-desi racism in engineering. (Though some exceptions exist of course.) If anything, it's positive racial stereotype in the field. (Though there are negative consequences down the line of course, but that's another story.)  Cold-applying to companies rarely results in any reply. They are indeed probably throwing your application in the trash, in favor of applicants they personally know. What you need to be doing is networking heavily, and applying to companies through referrals. You'll find that that will result in a MUCH higher response rate.

In addition to just generic prejudice however, you also have to take in the fact that many employers will look at your name and assume that you'll need visa sponsorship even if you are an American citizen. If you don't have visa issues, make sure that you mention that you are eligible for ITAR security clearance, indicating your citizenship status. Since plenty of Mechanical Engineering jobs require that clearance, it won't look out of place at all and makes things easier for you.  Also, the name on your resume does matter. If your name is a Muslim or Muslim-sounding name, make sure to change it. I know multiple people in our research group who had to change their names before getting calls for interviews. If you have a typical-sounding Hindu-origin name, you might be in safer territory but it still might be advisable to change it.  You don't necessarily have to fall into a victim mindset but it's important to remember that racial prejudice does exist and there's very little you can do about other people's prejudice. And unlike what many other people will tell you, you will have to work with and under many racist people all your life. You will not have the luxury to only work in racially tolerant havens."

The relatively (by Western standards) conservative US society (especially towards sex) causes teenagers to swing to the other end when they are finally allowed to go amok in colleges. It is not known how many rapes really happen on campus, but they are definitely under reported. And then there are many examples of victim shaming, of the perpetrator allowed to continue staying on campus etc.   Then, of course, was The Silent War that put crazy statistics on the rapes in the US military.  All this coupled with the fact that women are still not treated as equals in the workforce, and are pretty much biased against in many states before and after pregnancy.   My argument against moving to India would strictly be environmental. While the whole planet is on a downward slope, unless one is moving to rural India, chances are one's children will suffer terribly with the air pollution in any big city."

Every country - even the Scandinavian countries that are painted as feminist utopia - have violence against women (and men for good measure), but it's the severity of things that matter, no?   Else we're being a wee bit intellectually dishonest here. If you've lived in any major city in India and subsequently lived in a major city in the US, you'd see the differences yourself. But yes, plural of anecdotes is not data so I'm going to present you with some facts.  Admittedly, I haven't actually lived in India in over 6 years and had lived there on and off before that, but I spent most of my formative years in India, did high school and college in India, so I think I'm allowed to speak (I say this because for some reason us desis have this weird thing about an outsider not being allowed to express their opinion, apparently having lived outside of India for 6 years makes me an outsider too)  There are a ton of problems in India when it comes to women and I'm gonna talk about a few here.   Street Harassment: The level of street harassment in India is unbelievable.  (Anecdotal evidence warning). When I was in high school, I was walking outside a temple with my then girlfriend. A random guy, clearly groped her butt. I got pretty pissed off and was about to call him out when my ex said ""not worth the trouble, these things happen everyday"". Here's an educated, smart, 17 year old girl saying sexual harassment (let's call it what it is , no cute terms like eve teasing anymore) is so common that she doesn't think it's important to call it out. WSJ had a nice article on this (again a lot of anecdotes), but it shows how prevalent the problem is. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find comparative statistics on street harassment. I found this, but it's not strictly apples to apples based on how street harassment is defined. Female Foeticide/Female Infanticide Here's an article in The Hindu that talks about this problem. As for comparative statistics Wikipedia has a nice sortable table. If you sort by CIA Estimates and WBD (World Bank Database) estimates you'd see that India is the 5th worst or 7th worst respectively. Thare are only 4 (or 6) countries with a worse gender ratio. Do you think this is purely coincidental? That female babies are just magically disappearing? No, it's because they're either selectively aborted or killed at birth. Number of women in the workforce: We can look at big cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai and think ""well India is very egalitarian, there are a lot of women engineers, doctors, scientists, etc."", but we'll be falling prey to confirmation bias. Here's World Bank Data on the percentage of women over the age of 15 who make up the workforce. India is the 17th from the bottom with almost half the number of Germany and less than half of the US and the UK. Again, we can claim that it's because in India teenagers don't work and in the West, teenagers do, but I'm pretty sure 15-18 doesn't make up 29% (the difference between India and the US). Unsafe for women? A poll by Thomson Reuters Foundation concluded that India is the 4th most dangerous country to be a woman based on female infanticide and sex slavery.   Again, I have no particular problem with your comment. But every time I see a discussion come up on how safe/unsafe India is for women, I always see a few comments that say ""Oh, but there are problems in the USA too"". Yes there are problems everywhere, but why do we even have to compare?   In this particular case, it makes sense to compare because the author herself is comparing two countries. But then, comparing reported rapes and saying ""USA has it worse"" is a platitude that serves no purpose, because the comparison can never be apples to apples. In Indian villages, a lot of women are still not allowed to go outside the house without a male accompanying them. Do you think they'd go and report marital rape to the cops? Don't you think that's again being intellectually dishonest?  So I decided to use objective measures of gender equality that no one can disagree i.e. sex ratio at birth, ratio of women in the workplace and added something about street harassment for good measure because that's something I witnessed first hand and was appalled at.  TL;DR So yes, to your point USA has gender equality problems too (as does every country, really), but India has bigger problems, even objectively speaking."

It was written by an Indian born-and-raised woman who has no shortage of love for her homeland, but is trying to point out the issues that prevent her from raising her own daughter under similar circumstances.  That's why comparing rape reports from different countries does no good; it minimizes and deflects the very real dangers that Indian women face. By insisting that all countries have their problems (and they do, in no way am I trying to suggest that the U.S. is free from criticism), the voice of Indian women get drowned out in trying to tackle the problems that they live every day.  I'm not trying to criticize you, but I just want to point this out so it doesn't get missed: your comment about India's pollution started another chain that is completely unrelated to the subject of violence against women in a post about violence against women. That's just a small example of how the issue gets minimized and deflected. I know that wasn't your intention, but I wanted to point that out while it's in action so you could see how it happens."

What about all those protests? Did the Nirbhaya case change India? I wish it had. But I know it hasn't.   The author is concerned about the safety of her female child precisely because of the violence towards women. Violence towards women manifests in many ways, rape being the main avenue (acid attacks, family/dowry/marital violence being other means).   I'd have to disagree with you if you discount rape, and you'll have to agree with me that, if rape is an factor for her choice to abandon India, then she should do an apples-to-apples comparison with whatever country she decides to live in."

Rape stats are very difficult to compare in different countries. For one thing, there is more underreporting in India than in the U.S. Marital rape is also not criminalized in India, so that's a whole class of rape that isn't accounted for that would be in U.S. statistics. Indian culture also penalizes women more heavily than American culture; the skewed birth rates reflect that. This is just surface-level differences off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more issues underlying the stats.  And if you want anecdotal evidence, you should just ask any Indian born-and-raised woman currently in the U.S. which country she feels safer in, because her testimony would be the most relevant. I'm sure we have a few on this sub who would be able to chime in on the subject."

For all you know, your biases could be preventing you from viewing my assertions objectively.  I have already listed many reasons why reported rape would be skewed in India vs. the U.S. Sex is still a huge taboo to discuss in Indian culture.

All of that influences women's safety and rights.  And again - this ""debate"" about which country is safer is once again dismissing the issue that India has a cultural problem regarding rape.

And if the welfare of her girl is the point (which I think it is), she has other issues to worry about (such as the paucity of maternity leave, etc).

Frankly, I would rather worry about maternity leave than have to worry about whether my daughter (or I) would be raped if she/I left a little later from work than normal.

America is also seen as a land of immigrants compared to some other places like France. Not saying France doesn't have immigrants. I'm well aware of the North Africans pouring in, I'm saying that countries like Canada and America really emphasize immigration from all over the world."

Oh yeah, I love my AC too!""   She could have migrated to anywhere else - including Taiwan, Mongolia, Russia, etc.   I knew a lot of Indians who all claimed, while they were on H1B that they were not keen on settling in the USA. They all looked very pious and sincere in their assertions that they were not looking to live here. I have no idea why they lied like that."
ABCDesis,38dikb,deepaksmom,2,Thu Jun 4 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"I think her daughter was just the last reason she needed to justify not going back to India. There are better reasons to not go back to India than being a woman.   Just a few off the top of my head. Her daughter is far more likely to die in a road accident in India than be raped or have acid thrown at her or be killed for dowry. Her being in a privileged position means that her daughter won't be trafficked or sold off for financial reasons and she certainly wasn't killed in the womb(I am picking these because these are the factors that resulted in India being labelled as the 4th most dangerous country for women as someone above me pointed out). Whether her daughter chooses to work or not is far more dependent on them than anything else. But whatever, it makes for a popular opinion piece in HuffingtonPost I guess."

No one comes to USA for the western culture that is seriously a lie. We come fro the opportunities and money.You don't know the rupee-dollar conversion ratio. What I earn in India in one year, I earn in 1 month in USA. To tell the truth We first generation immigrants have it good in USA. We don't have any culture problems because we know we are Indians and are connected to our culture , ie can talk Indian languages. Racism is non existent in real life except for the certain ""micro aggressions"". Dating is not a problem as we tend to date amongst ourselves. Everything is okay we are in our nice cubby hole with a few Indian friends who I suspect we will have for our entire life.

After that we work in high technology including MS, Google and pretty much half the valley. Much of the economy is built on Indian and Chinese researchers and engineers. So you're not really doing us a favour.   I love the US and what it has achieved in its history, I love the cities, the interstates, the national and state parks and the government. But I cannot feel any sense of ownership or belonging here. I'm just floating along as a tourist who's eating, drinking, traveling and saving for a few years.

We got to know each other the weekend after a campus Navaratri party. She is beautiful, intelligent, witty, and also very sweet. She is talented in many areas and so level-headed and reasonable that I can trust her with anything. A few months after we met, I was fairly certain I wanted to spend my life with her and she felt the same way.  Wedding plans came together surprisingly quickly -- almost unthinkable how fast. We already had plans to go to India and members of my family living abroad were already slated to be in India at the same time. The moment my fiancée and I expressed interest in getting married this summer, both families worked together to get the whole shebang planned out. Now here we are in the middle of it!  The worst thing about all this is that by tradition, my fiancée and I are kept apart till marriage. It's been a week and I really miss her. At least I get to see her tomorrow! I plan to laugh in her face during shubho drishti (the ""first"" meeting after the wedding where she is supposed to lower two large Paan leaves to let me see her eyes).  Anyway, I should get some sleep before everything gets started. It's midnight now; ceremonies start at 4 AM and do not let up until the following day.  Married life, here I come!

I literally winced as I stuffed the roti into my mouth and quickly followed with a spoonful of spicy, amazing chole. It was disgusting and I was so upset afterwards.   Okay. I'm not a regular poster in this sub so I'm fairly unaware if this is a parody post or something, but how the fuck are some of you guys so self-conscious about this shit. It's not like eating food with your hands is a completely foreign idea to white people, so why not just show them how it's done?

Buddy, if you're the only Indian in the office, you're already the token Indian whether you like or not. This isn't one of those situation where you can fake-it-till-you-make-it.

ABCDesis,38abbz,Good_Job_Dave_Man,2,Thu Jun 4 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for the honesty. I appreciate your willingness to tell me like it is.  Of course, I was being fairly flippant / exaggerating slightly (""My body was ready for some sweet, sexy chole?""), but the idea of being caught between multiple ideals, being tokenized for your identity (even with something as trivial as food habits), is something a lot of Indian-Americans can relate to, imho. (Let me know if you think I'm wrong.)  Also, being a token is never a fun position to be in. It can be fairly reductive, and in the context of the workplace, it can implicitly allow people to place certain stereotypes upon you that aren't necessarily fair or right. Should that be my problem? Of course not! But, tokenization (even with something as trivial as how I eat) becomes my problem when it starts to affect my career."
ABCDesis,38abbz,jhschmidt007,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"Could you or anyone really explain what you mean by tokenization. Unless you're fairly white passing, wouldn't you already have at least some stereotypes placed upon you by de facto of your skin colour? I can't see how eating your food properly would change (reasonable) people's interpretation of you.      I mean IMO, the fact that you're so uncomfortable with eating how you naturally would shows that you're not really ""one of them""."

You're saying that if you ate with your hands it would change you from what I'm assuming you think is ""one of them""  to a stereotypical token Indian.   And since the identity of being ""one of them"" depends on the location and environment of the group, it makes me wonder, what's the difference between a token and not a token in your workplace? Like say, if you eat with your hands and do other ""Indian"" stuff, you're a token Indian. But if you eat like your co-workers and act exactly like your co-workers, you're a _____?   (American?)"
ABCDesis,38abbz,i_am_not_sam,2,Thu Jun 4 07:57:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. I think what I'm trying to get at is exactly what you're articulating -- it's cool to be the ""unique Indian"" who ""embraces her heritage"" until it crosses the line into ""not able to assimilate"" and ""not like us."" The whole point of my post is that the act of negotiating personal identity is not a clear-cut, black-and-white thing (no pun intended).   When it comes to questions of expressing my cultural identity, I often get advice like ""Be who you really are!"" But the person dispensing that advice often doesn't realize that there are consequences for those actions. Like it or not, eating Indian food with my hands at work is going to be perceived differently than if I eat pizza/a burger with my hands. It sucks, but it's true.  Make sense?

ABCDesis,38abbz,Fanboy0550,3,Wed Jun 3 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're born in America or immigrated here early, I don't think you need to worry about assimilation.

Like it or not, eating Indian food with my hands at work is going to be perceived differently than if I eat pizza/a burger with my hands.   Okay this will sound very blunt but if you're not white, you'll always be perceived differently no matter what (positively or negatively) in some way or another, by a fair amount of white folks. It is what it is. Pandering to every perceived opportunity to not differentiate yourself from the norm is a fruitless exercise because at the end of the day, no matter you do, you'll never perceived by others they way we all wish we were. You'll always be seen as Indian/Pakistani/whatever-American not just American, unfortunately (or fortunately for some), so there's no real point of fighting against your Desi-ness.  I mean you could fight the stereotypes as much as you want, but it's not really up to you, if someone wants to apply stereotypes upon you they'll do so regardless of your actions.

Obviously, things are changing, but there's more nuance to this discussion than I can appropriately convey in a Reddit post.   Remember, people that embrace negative stereotypes are naturally assholes and often stubborn.  Not necessarily. Often, people have implicit biases that they don't necessarily recognize as being negative, but that lead to negative stereotyping. (I call this ""I'm-not-racist-but"" syndrome.)

At work, I've had to face a lot of double standards with regards to the way that I present my ideas & approach other coworkers. My organization has a ""startup"" feel, with bullish/strong personalities and passionate people. It's why I wanted to work there to begin with. However, I've been reprimanded when I adopt some of those same behaviors and called ""abrasive,"" ""hard to work with,"" etc, even though other staff members (mainly white males) do the exact same thing. I think it may have to do with the stereotype / expectation of Asian women being quiet, meek, submissive, ""worker bees"" (which I am not & have never been, no matter how hard I try.) I think the media has done a really good job of advancing Indians in the U.S. (Mindy Kaling, Aziz Ansari, MIA, Miss America. etc) and expanding the narrative about us."

If you've ever seen Argo (came out in 2012), the film was about how the FBI used a fake movie to rescue U.S. diplomats from Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis. In order to tell the story, the director (Ben Affleck) had to take some creative licenses and change certain facts about how the events played out. That created controversy with:    Canadians, who felt the film gave most of the credit for the rescue to the CIA instead of recognizing the huge role the Canadian embassy played in rescuing the diplomats; and  British and New Zealanders, as the embassies were shown in the film as having turned the diplomats away when in real life they played a crucial role in assisting them alongside the Canadians; and Hispanics, who felt that the role of Mendez should have gone to an actor with Mexican heritage, not Affleck.   And that's just politics. Now throw in religion, lol."

ABCDesis,389x45,dope_boi,-4,Tue Jun 2 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"Why don't you cite examples or counterexamples?  You will find it difficult to refute that Hollywood possess all the talent it needs with regards to direction, CGI supervision, screenplay, etc.  All that remains is for someone to assemble the right combination.  For example, I'd let Tarsem Singh take a shot at this. While his The Fall was gorgeous and an intricate story, his The Immortals was quite crap, but he does posses the skill set to execute a neutral movie with vivid graphics.  I do realize that Hollywood is not inclusive, but there are myriad indie directors (Miranda July, for eg) who fill that void if one went looking for it.  In the end, a movie with heavy CGI cannot be executed by indie/art house production just because of the sheer budget size. I, personally, do not subscribe to Hollywood ""blockbusters"", but do indulge in a well-made visual-heavy movie (like T2 or Adventures of Tintin) every now and then."
ABCDesis,389x45,book-of-kells,8,Tue Jun 2 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"I did give you an example in another comment. There are a lot of factors that go into making a movie, especially one with a huge budget, and the long and short of it is that an Indian epic wouldn't be treated with blockbuster potential at this time by industry executives.  I'm not trying to be a Negative Nancy, I do see where you're coming from and I'd salivate at seeing an Indian epic on the silver screen. Tarsem Singh would probably be a great choice as an Indian-American director. But Hollywood is not yet ready for it.  EDIT: Also, Hollywood lacks talent in one crucial area: Desi actors with global name-brand leverage. (No, Bollywood actors will not cut it.) That's IF Hollywood even thinks to cast Indian actors instead of hiring white actors to play Indian gods. And I shouldn't have to go into why that would be problematic, lol."
ABCDesis,389x45,cracklescousin1234,-5,Tue Jun 2 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Why exactly would that be problematic? So you are saying it would be fine for me to be cast as a Hindu God just because I am Indian even though my family has been Christian as long as any family in the US? Or are only Hindus allowed to play Hindu gods? It's a movie. It's fiction. Krishna and Shiva are freaking blue. They aren't Indians, they are gods. The race of the actors who plays them doesn't matter.   Also, unlike  east Asians, Indians are ethnically Caucasian so getting a non Indian to play a Hindu God really isn't a problem at all. With some makeup it would be pretty freaking easy to get an Italian or Greek American to look Indian. Hell when I went to southern Europe most people though I was European.   Attitudes like yours are pointless and in the end do more harm than good. You base your approval of the movie on some arbitrary metrics you probably can't even describe properly so in the end you will never be happy. You really have no right to be so mindlessly protective."
ABCDesis,389x45,book-of-kells,4,Wed Jun 3 04:16:05 2015 UTC,Indians are not 'ethnically Caucasian'. There's no such thing as Caucasian unless you mean exactly 'people from the Caucasus mountains'. It is an American invention.

ABCDesis,389x45,frackaracka,2,Sat Jun 6 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, the problem is that Indian actors have had to whiten up. Naveen Andrews got lucky. Kunnal Nayar became famous for playing a stereotype. But think how Kal Penn and Ben Kingsley anglicized their names to work in an industry where we are background workers or hilarious stereotypes.  It's kind of why people like Dev Patel are doing a good job. We are seeing more and more Indian actors doing positive things in western media and I think a Hindu epic should have people who look the part.  Put it this way. One of the most important villains in nerd pop culture is Khan. First played by a Mexican, then by a British guy.  Only? He was supposed to be from India and was India's ""homo superior"" created to fight a terrible global war. A relic of a more savage age. The ultimate Indian....  Oh look a white British guy.... I mean maybe no one realised what that means when they cast him. It's daft that even when characters are made to represent us we don't get to play them!"
ABCDesis,389x45,frackaracka,2,Wed Jun 3 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"I actually don't disagree with that particular casting choice.

We can have brown villains when they are also accompanied by brown heroes."
ABCDesis,389x45,dope_boi,2,Sat Jun 6 02:54:27 2015 UTC,We CAN be villains. And Khan was never a bad villain. He was extremely complex as one.   And he was a more understandable terrorist.

But what I'm saying is that you have to balance that out with protagonists, and in order to avoid the racism inherent in casting a brown guy as a terrorist, you have to balance that character out with a brown guy in a positive role.

My guess is a combination of exorbitant rates and sufficient production time needed to turn out one tentpole film as opposed to several mass-produced Bollywood films in the same time span.  That trailer looked awesome, actually. Way better than what I was expecting!"
ABCDesis,389x45,frackaracka,3,Tue Jun 2 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"Unless you stick to the traditional narrative, all the religious nuts will go nuts.  well 60s had a lot of mythology based movies at least in south Indian movie industries.   Bollywood has always been about blockbusters and finding the common entertainment denominator (I find watching bollywood movies dreadful), and its always a risk spending lot of money on a film which might piss off lot of religious people (since figuring out what might offend people in India is pretty much a roulette game)  There are been few indie movies based on indian myth form outside india as well check out ""Sita sings the blues"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172203/"
ABCDesis,389x45,-drbadass-,2,Tue Jun 2 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"I liked Sita Sings the Blues! It had one singing Sita too many, but it recast the myth in a way that I hadn't thought about before."
ABCDesis,389x45,uninquisitor,3,Tue Jun 2 23:30:43 2015 UTC,But Myths have always been told from different perspective since a long time. Just that everyone knows only the popular version ..  there are versions of ramayana where sita is ravan's daughter
ABCDesis,389x45,costaccounting,2,Wed Jun 3 09:26:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't mean to sound dismissive of it. I was familiar with the story as it was taught to me as a kid, so watching that short film made me think about Sita's treatment by Ram for the first time, which was a perspective that I hadn't given much thought to before.  That's so interesting about Sita being Ravan's daughter in a different version, I didn't know that! That also dramatically changes the popular version, lol."
ABCDesis,389x45,costaccounting,2,Wed Jun 3 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"yea It is really interesting.  my uncle writes mythology based fictions, so when he does research for books we always interesting conversations about different perspectives."
ABCDesis,389elt,deepaksmom,4,Tue Jun 2 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"The thing about banking is, that its the sell-side. So you are non-stop putting together pitch books to get deals. That's why so many after 2 years leave for the buy side for better hours and more pay. Another issue is that they don't hire a lot of analyst that's why bankers are paid so well. A group might have 1-3 analyst if they hired more the work can be distributed, hours lowered, but pay will be down as well.    I know a few banks have a mandatory 2-week off, not sure how well its enforced. Bankers aren't allowed to work on weekends as well unless working on a live deal. Again there are policies on the books to promote a work life balance, but are they enforced?   But banking does give you some of the best skill sets out there if you plan on staying in the corporate world. The exit opportunities are pretty damn good. From P.E, PP3, Hedge Fund, Corp Dev/Strat, IR, VC etc..  I did an internship with a bank, realize there is a lot of different ways to make money. Sometimes I ask myself should I go back and work those hours again so I have better exit opportunities. My current job has a great work-life balance but the exit opportunities for bigger and better opportunities aren't just there."
ABCDesis,389elt,Throwthisawaysjs,2,Tue Jun 2 20:12:13 2015 UTC,Granted I am in markets and not proper investment banking but the policies are the same for all of us at my bank. Mandatory two weeker. You cannot get away without taking it or compliance flips out (and makes you take it anyway).

ABCDesis,389elt,destinys_parent,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you'll have to go to a Top 10 MBA program and go from there. It's the most plausible way, especially when it involves a career change.   You'll need a 700+ GMAT score, good GPA in your undergrad, and minimum like 4 years of working experience. Engineers look pretty nice, from what I recall. And go do something special/unique with whatever free time you got. You should have a good shot with the above stated."
ABCDesis,389elt,x6tance,0,Wed Jun 3 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need top 10. Anything in top 15 will do. Fuqa, Darden, Ross, Kelley, Vandy, Nova, Emory. All do well into placing people into IB after MBA. If hes shooting for AM, IM, or PE then anything short of , HBS, GSB and Wharton will be a long shot.   GMAT is going be a crucial part of your application. But 700+ isn't a guarantee people with 600s have gotten in. Check out Beatthegmat.com   I'm looking into MBA and shooting for top 15. M7 is going soooo difficult. But I;m not interested in IB as much as I'm interested in Corp Dev."

I would love to get my MBA from a Top 20, myself, but, have no aspirations for those high finance jobs.

ABCDesis,389elt,x6tance,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:19:05 2015 UTC,HF is pretty tough. But Stern does very well with IB placement. There is also Equity Research as well. I've been looking into that and you can transition to the buy side from ER.  Just so lazy to start studying for GMAT
ABCDesis,389elt,Throwthisawaysjs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, heard about that Equity Research thing into higher finance as well. You could skip the GMAT and go for the CFA and go that route, but, I'm not feeling that. Lol, I like being in the middle of IT and Accounting.   Stern's part time MBA really appeals to me, but, I don't know if it'll happen."
ABCDesis,389elt,x6tance,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:08:36 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about just that couple days back. How they work these people to death for like, what? $140k first year? With the hours put in, it's definitely not worth it and all these other costs that you can't put a number on such as costs. I mean, working 80-100 hours, how is one supposed to be a regular at the gym and get in shape? What about proper family time? Sleep? Down the line, the money might make up for it, but, not as a first year, imo. It's sad when people commit suicide cause they are so engrossed in this work that they haven't had the time to realize that they can pull out of this line of work without expelling their life. It's not end of the world if they don't show up tomorrow and labor laws are always there to protect them. (Unless something was written in their contract?)  The other thing is, I highly doubt that they can't pay the same with a couple more hiring. It's more like, they don't mind maximizing profits and if a human life goes, it's only a temporary loss cause many more are poised to line up and do this prestigious line of work.   Working for Goldman Sachs sounds nice, but, I'm really weary of these big banks."

ABCDesis,388y5n,Shinobhi,3,Wed Jun 3 04:27:46 2015 UTC,"That was exactly my experience traveling in Turkey as an Indian. Everyone was curious (in a good way) whether I was from Pakistan and whether I am Muslim. But even when I told them that I was from India (and the Turkish word is 'Hindistan', not Hindustan) and that I was not Muslim, people were still happy to know more about me and very nice.  My experience with food was much better though. I stuck to ordinary restaurants and small places and I had the best kebabs of my life there. And not just kebabs either. Small places in Cappadociya had these amazing lentil soups, cheese-filled flatbreads and beef-eggplant casseroles that were amazing!  It's a beautiful place and I loved the people there.

Also it's not at all surprising that many people there speak good German, every other person has relatives there and also there are cultural-historical reasons for it.   I'm Indian and the Turks were fascinated by that, LOL. Also my father claimed that they mistook me for Turkish because a lot of people defaulted to Turkish when speaking to me, but I don't think I believe that. I don't think I look Turkish at all."

ABCDesis,388y5n,pee_boy,3,Tue Jun 2 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's just that Germany used to be much more important geopolitically in Europe compared to the Anglo-Saxon world.

It's possible also that the staff you encountered worked at least temporarily in Germany."
ABCDesis,388y5n,pee_boy,2,Tue Jun 2 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Reason why there are so many Turkish people who speak German is because of immigration wave, which happened in 60's when West Germany's economy was booming and there was an acute Labor shortage, the Turkish arrived in Germany as guest workers (also from other countries but i think the largest group was from Turkey) Most of them settled, and now turks see Germany as how Gujjus see US :P"

I'm trying to finish Entourage before I watch the movie. Netflix and cartoons means you've seen Bojack Horseman, right? I don't know what to make of it - it makes me laugh one second and the next it's super heavy and heart-wrenching.  Oh, I get you. Most everything I study or read or watch inevitably gets analyzed or dissected because there's always more to understand and know more. Except, my long paragraphs occur more in the form of word vomit and my hands waving around excitedly. I've started doing football film analysis to at least let some of my thoughts out.  What really bothers me about colonialism is that my family was part of the ""model minority"" in India which has in turn carried itself over to the United States. And, my parents and I tend to butt heads a lot of the times over these things lol."

Unfortunately it takes a few episodes to really hit its stride, and most people I've recommended it to just don't seem to have the patience to stick it out until it does.  Season 2 comes out next month though!"

ABCDesis,3883l3,Projotce,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"What do you mean Britishize? We may be thinking of similar things. I was thinking more along the lines of Indian Brahmins initially welcoming the British raj to displace the power of the Mughals (my family is Brahmin), certain Indians making it through the English schooling system but being limited economically and structurally (my great-grandfather knew English and had the local English administrator would visit their house) and the cultivation of a Hindu nationalist identity (my grandma was a fan of the BJP long before Modi got elected). I wish I'd known a lot of the stuff I know now when my grandparents were still around. I feel like my grandma and I would've had some awesome talks about politics.  Try it! It's not super-libertarian like South Park. Idk how to describe it. What's ATLA?"

It was a show on Nickelodeon when I was a kid, but I didn't watch until the sequel series, Legend of Korra, came out a few years ago. Great show. :D  I know what you mean, I think. That's what I mean by the Britishisation of Indians. I dunno if I'd call it model minority on the grounds that Indians in India definitely were not a minority, lol, and that the model minority has to do with a group achieving socioeconomic success, which results in them being used to say they don't face racism or even that racism probably isn't real. Maybe ""model natives"" or something?  The BJP thing ... maybe their supporters tend to be Brahmins, because I know my family likes the BJP. It would make sense since Brahmins (and Kshatriyas?) generally were at the top of society at the times that the Hindu nationalists tend to look at as the good old days."

I've watched the series with friends since, but it's been a couple years and we binged. I agree though. Great show.  ""Model minority"" might not be the best naming, but Brahmins who had attained a certain education were used as tools by the British raj and also weaponized against lower castes and Muslims. This reproduced itself through the establishment of the British education system in India. My reading of the Desi model minority status, and ABCDs in particular, is one in which we've achieved socioeconomic success, but the key is that we experience racism in-between ""Whiteness"" and ""Blackness"". So we can say racism isn't real because we've achieved socioeconomic success while supporting anti-Black policy and practice...only to experience Islamophobia and psychological violence due to Whiteness. I love that we're trying to tease out this shit while I'm trying to get my mom to read The Karma of Brown folk lol.  Supporters of the BJP tend to be Brahmins and members of the urban middle class too - really good book on this.  Back to Entourage lol"

ABCDesis,3866kl,asdfioho,6,Tue Jun 2 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"[www.reddit.com/user/Shinobhi] I think there's this tension between being a model minority and a dump bag for ""negative brown stereotypes"" (Indian plus any other ethnicity that reads as brown to white americans especially) which makes life difficult. So a lot of Indians keep bumping up against being ""not white"" especially when you're young. You're not seen at all unless you're a model of a model minority, and even that's not a guarantee.  Plus there is a lot of racial bullying that parents and school authorities will not acknowledge, that kids don't even acknowledge to themselves because it's painful."

Not to mention, their relative fairness and European-esqe features make them look white, and of course, in desi culture, white=best. Growing up my parents would always say Iranians/Afghanis were very beautiful because of their ""white"" features. Not joking here, and looking back I find it absolutely sickening.

ABCDesis,3866kl,VictorShakapopulis,2,Tue Jun 2 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Maybe their culture is more macho and doesn't allow any room for shame. Maybe their communities are more insular and so the kids never feel out of place. Or maybe they really are out there in as great a proportion as desis. Cuz I'll be honest, I haven't observed what you're observing. Most Indians that I know are very much in touch with and not ashamed of their culture.

Yes, other races have negative stereotypes of us and tend to treat us poorly. I wonder when I don't get a job - is it because I wasn't qualified or because of my background? I know there's things that happen in the workplace that a white person would never be questioned about, or be given a pass on. I know desis are looked down upon and fare worse in the dating market, etc etc etc.   Forget all that.  I don't like being desi because of how we treat EACH OTHER.   Our family dynamics fucking suck. Our parents pressure and push us, all in the name of family reputation. Many of us live sheltered and limited lives, in the name of ""oh what will this Auntie think!"" All that matters is a career and marriage.   The way our families expect our lives to go is absolutely fatalistic.   You go...  Born -> School -> Job -> Marriage -> Have Kids -> Die  That's all you're worth in desi culture. God forbid, you try and reject that. The family pressure becomes crushing and will put you back into line. I have a cousin whose a physician - worked her butt off to get there, and in her mid 30s, none of it matters. It's all about suitable marriagability.   Reputation is another sticking point. Everything is about how someone else perceives us, and we stretch and contort our lives to fit an ideal so some asshole we see twice a year will be moderately impressed. How have we not moved past this?  How about misogyny? We treat women like cattle. To be locked up at home, until a suitor comes by and wishes to take her away. Some people complain that too many desi women are dating white guys. I don't blame those desi women one goddamned bit. Look at your own families and home lives, if I was a desi woman - I would be running far fucking away from it.   Moving outside of family dynamics? I work with many desis and it's honestly awful. We go out of our way to try and cut down and get ahead of each other. Friend circles with desis go similarly, lots of back biting and gossip.   That's why I don't like being desi. We are SO shitty to each other."

But this factor plus the tension between being part of a model minority and a projection screen for ""negative brown stereotypes"" makes many desis acutely miserable.

But for those who were, how is it any different than the single-minded way Caucasians push their kids to be athletic and value attractiveness? Every sporting event I've been to, it is always the white parents screaming at the top of their lungs, yelling obscenities at the referees or kids on the opposing team.   It's fucking pathetic. For example, I was at my little cousin's soccer game down in Jersey last weekend, and were appalled at how obnoxious parents were on the sidelines. Bunch of boorish morons. So while I agree we can be very cruel to one another, so are other ethnicities. It is human nature.  One thing I do agree is that many Desi kids are sheltered and not well rounded as individuals. However, I've also met a lot of Jewish kids who fit that mold as well."

I suppose they know they'll get backlash if they say stuff like this in real life so its safer to say it online? But whatever the case is I think its such a shame. It doesn't help that South Asians in general put White people or anyone who is light skinned on a pedestal and automatically view them as superior. I'm not saying everyone thinks this consciously but I think the attitude is there. There's just a lot of self-hate in South Asian culture, among Indians in India and abroad. Its almost like its in our DNA and its makes me really angry. I am ashamed to say still have some residue of this attitude somewhere even though I've consciously tried to get rid of it over the years. I hope that people who feel this way are still young and grow to accept themselves and take pride in their roots. But it becomes a bit pathetic when people who are adults do this kinda thing and I honestly lose respect for them"
ABCDesis,3866kl,LotusEyes92,2,Tue Jun 2 04:41:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's a residue of colonialism.

We cling to cultural pride because it was what we had as resistance against the British agenda to ""civilize the coolies"" or whatever else. For a few hundred years the Desi elite were constantly made to compare ourselves to them directly, and while some Victorian values were assimilated, the treatment of Desis as weird, exotic, and backward still left us with a sense of inferiority because we were thought to not be able to govern ourselves or achieve what the overlords viewed as success. So it's kind of like we want to show them we can achieve the same status and success as them without compromising our cultural values. This still means we end up making the West a goal to achieve, however, and so both whiteness and white acceptance of South Asian cultures is still an end goal. It's quite a rebellious response.   That's how I see it anyway. :P  Edited because I kept saying ""Indian"" as if it doesn't apply to other Desis. Sorry guys, I'm new here and have mostly known Indians for most of my life, heheh."

ABCDesis,3866kl,IndianAmericanteen,10,Wed Jun 3 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"Using a throwaway since I've done this...a lot. It's not that I'm ashamed to be Indian, it just lets me escape the stigmas associated with being an Indian man. I usually go for being Fijian or some obscure country where there is not an outright media portrayal of that place. Indians in general get a really shitty rep in the media and people tend to project those stereotypes on to you so it's not like you start with a clean slate, you have to put in work to erase their pre-existing biases. ""But, /u/lurkm0arplz, you shouldn't even be friends/lovers with people like that LOLZ"" you say? I can't really fault these people for holding these biases because, let's face it, there's a metric ton of Indian people who fit these stereotypes perfectly. Although, I guess it's changing with the 2nd and 3rd generation coming of age in the US. Here are the stereotypes I feel I'm avoiding by claiming I'm not Indian:   Being cheap - I have many friends in the service industry who claim Indian people and Black people are the worst people to serve because they make you run around and in the end stiff you on the tip. If you read any of the AMAs on reddit for anyone in the service industry or even one of the stripper AMAs, you'll see this confirmed once again. To combat this, I just overtip. I generally tip 25%. Shitty service? Guess what buddy, you get 20% for the sins of my people. Being disrespectful of women - The rape scene in India is not helping me any here. Once again I refer the stripper AMAs on reddit and Indian men by far are high on their list of customers they hate. I once went to a strip club in Vegas and it was a thing where the strippers came and did a little mini dance and you tipped em and they moved on. OFC the Indian men there don't tip. So now the strippers are avoiding me and I have to build mountains of dollar bills on the table to get them over. Also, 1 idiot stuck his finger in the girls butt in the midst of her dance. I mean, they're stippers, but they're still people not objects. wtf? Smelly - The concept of using deodorant is foreign to many people who've migrated state side. Even if you do use deodorant and shower daily, it  doesn't help that our food smells tend to stick to our clothes. I shower twice during summer and bathe in body spray, but none of that shit is going to help when I visit home and mom's cooking. But, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make cause the food is delicious!  Small penis syndrome - Enough said. IDK how this is true, but whether legit or not, this is automatically assumed   These are just the ones I could think of off the top of my head. Claiming to be non-Indian gets me out of people judging me for the above when none of it applies to me. It also doesn't help that Indian actors tend to take roles that feed these stereotypes outside of Aziz Ansari and maybe Kumail Nanjiani. Maybe if I lived in a place where there were a lot of Indians, I wouldn't have to do this, but I live in a city full of white people. And this is what I do to make it easier on myself to meet people. Ofc, once they're friends or more, I have to come clean and do the awkward explanation."

I have a friend who has been to strip clubs multiple times in San Francisco and Minneapolis (where he lives). He loved his experience in SF so much better because the Latina strippers were so much friendlier and nicer to him. The mostly White strippers in Minneapolis were sometimes outright rude compared to the Latina strippers in SF. He then tipped accordingly.   My personal experience traveling with Air France, which I do often because of their convenient routes and fares from my city in the US to India, has been so bad that now I make it a point to only request water or other stuff from flight attendants who are not White. Air France always has Francophone African or Ethiopian or Sri Lankan women flight attendants who are just so much nicer to deal with than the disgusted faces of White French flight attendants.

Clearly lol I know its difficult  especially when you grow up mostly around white people but by accepting these stereotypes (I know a lot are rooted in truth) and trying to distance yourself from them you are just excusing and taking part in their racism rather than standing up for yourself.  This kinda thing isn't black and white and I don't mean to be harsh (I empathise to a large extent) but you can't hide the fact that you are Indian forever. And when you tell people you are infact Indian you are actually opening yourself up to a far harsher judgement than if you were just smelly or a bad tipper. Not respecting who you are isn't the kind of thing most people look too kindly on. At least that's what I've observed. You would probably make life a whole lot easier for yourself if you worked on accepting who you are.  Sorry for sounding condescending but I had to say it.

Only if they show that they are above the average in both quantitative and qualitative metrics might they have a case.   This fight seems one that needs to be made on the basis of averages, i.e. groups not individuals. Are admittance rates representative is the bigger question, not one guy. Getting into college is so incredibly competitive that nobody should feel entitled to a spot. Every single person who goes on a college tour gets told that they might have the right background but many do as well and they should not feel like a failure if they don't get into particular places."

I myself had a 2300 and will be graduating with 13 APs (yes, with all 5's) under my belt, it doesn't he is fucking entitled to anything, especially given that he got into stellar schools regardless. One of my friends didn't get into UPenn despite being stellar in finance and was really dejected, but got into Duke, UChicago, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton. Some of my friends got really shafted (I have a friend with the same number of APs as me, a 2400, higher GPA, and he didn't get into any Ivies or similar tier schools per say), but I have no clue why this dude is complaining given that at least he got somewhere. I feel I got kind of shafted myself for some schools, but I try to take a look at the big picture; there are highs at some points in my academic career, and there will inevitably be lows, statistically speaking, where the luck just doesn't push right in my direction. The key is to making sure the overall journey turns out strong.  I sometimes feel as if adults emphasize the SAT a lot more than we even care, at least in my school. People look at me like I'm some prodigy for my SAT score, and while I certainly do perceive that I'm intelligent (albeit definitely not a prodigy) it's because of my independent thoughts and work in actual complex subjects. Some of the AP exams are honestly pretty trivial if you've put the work in during class throughout the year, and the SAT is not actually that hard per say, considering the math is basic and the essay is extremely superficial (compare this to math and writing in the classroom where it is pretty challenging), I think the biggest thing that trips people up is careless errors."

What this article doesn't say is that our high school was pretty fucking easy--straight A's don't really mean a whole lot, even with Honors/AP classes--and from what I hear this kid was pretty fucking terrible at debate.

ABCDesis,384oxf,GWmyc2,10,Mon Jun 1 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"Just because UPenn has a high proportion of Asians (19% - impressive, admittedly) doesn't mean that they're not turning away boatloads of Asians with identical stats (hobbies/backgrounds included). But of course, there's no way to be certain as of this moment.   Hopefully, the demerit for being Asian isn't as bad at UPenn as it is at certain medical schools (1/9th as likely), but my point is that it very well could be, and I think it's a question that begs investigation. If Michael was white, would he have gotten in? If UPenn Admissions were identical to med schools, he'd be 50% more likely.  That's bullshit."
ABCDesis,384oxf,Nolat,6,Mon Jun 1 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"I'd like to echo what GWmyc2 is saying regarding backgrounds. I've participated in high school policy debate and gone on to college policy debate. Asians in speech and debate activities in high school greatly outnumber their Asian counterparts in college. This suggests that Asians participate in speech and debate in high school to win, admittedly, but for college application purposes. The turnover for things such as taking music lessons as a kid is pretty large as well. Perhaps he was denied for an applicant who interviewed better, or maybe a more well-rounded individual, or maybe someone with more diverse interests as GWmyc2 suggested. It's a little frustrating to me how he can complain about not getting into any Ivies except for Penn and can attend Williams College.  Now to the article you posted. Let's look at the raw AAMC data. Of the racial groups getting into to medical school (http://i.gyazo.com/3afa0ad681b8f059b28e1c94536ad0d5.png [it's not a faulty link, it's a screenshot software]) Asians accepted (~18%) rank second to whites (~52%). Accepted blacks and Latino/as (~12%) pale in comparison to that. Keep in mind that Blacks and Latino/as comprise a larger proportion of the overall US population than Asians. Asians are outperforming whites AND other minority groups in getting accepted to medical school. No ""reverse-racism"" to see here, move on. It's also worth noting that the proportion of applicants also reflects similar numbers, which means, yes, medical schools will be more selective of selecting Asians due to the sheer amount of Asians that apply respective of their proportion to the total population. Can someone confirm my logic is right on this? Even if it's not, I think it's worth noting that white people still comprise the largest applying, accepting and matriculating population.  tl;dr - the proportion of accepted Asians to the rest of the accepted populations to medical school is much greater than the proportion of Asians vis-a-vis other minorities in the US writ-large.  Are you, as a Desi (?), going to uncritically buy a white guy's shoddy explanation of how you're getting shafted by black people? A white guy who no doubt stands to benefit from causing discord between minority groups while white people still remain on top?"

A person who's numbers are above average but also performs well in other areas - hard work in the face of difficult circumstances, exceptional communication skills, diverse employment and extracurricular experience certainly fits the bill. Diverse applicants pull up their communities as a whole. They (we) also add perspectives and experiences that other students wouldn't have encountered otherwise.

Lost her scholarship because commuting plus doing shit for her family plus working got in the way of school. Took out a shit ton of loans. Did poorly in school. Turned down a good paying job that would take her out of state (dumb move). Still lives at home and has a sort of similar existence as you. She works at her parents hotel now despite have two degrees and suffers a lot from depression.   Do not be this girl. I would do anything to help my friend out but she needs to at least make some sort of effort to break herself out of her rut. I have offered for her to move in with me (rent free), my dad has offered her a job, I've tried to hook her up with friends to get her a job but no dice.  You have a job and the potential for another. Who cares that it's weed trimming? Extra money is extra money. Put it towards getting out. Get that teaching certificate or hell, just moving out. You can probably work at another auto dealer anywhere while you sort things out.   What did you get your degree in? What did you want to do before (although nothing wrong with your job not being your passion, which I think my friend does not understand)?   You're 22, you don't have to have it together and you can mess up. You can pay your parents back for school later so don't let them guilt trip you while you find your footing."

ABCDesis,383oyz,marshajjj,2,Mon Jun 1 20:45:50 2015 UTC,I agree. This is good for a college course touching on Asian studies but def not for K-12. It would be a bit arrogant to believe it deserves a place over other stuff they can't even fit in at the moment.

ABCDesis,383kpi,iLoveSethMacfarlane,9,Mon Jun 1 16:35:29 2015 UTC,Have you tried talking to him (and to your mom) about it and explaining how embarrassing/awkward it is for you that he keeps doing that? Ask them how they'd feel if you did the same to them - call their co-workers daily and ask if they are there.
ABCDesis,383kpi,oh-just-another-guy,5,Mon Jun 1 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"I am going to tell my dad when he gets home. It's not daily, I am actually not sure how often he has done it."

ABCDesis,383kpi,x6tance,8,Mon Jun 1 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/bug-bear.   Tell him that it's not normal in America for this to happen and that it's not Lahore/Karachi/Islamabad/whatever and that it's not seen as a good thing for your future endeavors and employers. Inform him that sometimes, plans change imminently and that you can't always provide pinpoint location. Reassure him that you are fine and not doing anything dangerous or going anywhere that is unsafe/unfamiliar.   However, by staying quiet and not talking to him about this, he won't understand how you feel and at the same time, he feels like he's doing well by making sure you're alright. Also keeps his anxiety controlled.  I know it seems crazy and possessive, but, your Dad is just concerned about you and is a bit frightened after that one event. Desi parents tend to think the most absolute negative when something doesn't go quite according to plan when it involves their children.   If he's extremely controlling and this is just one example, the same reason may persist, but there could also be more to it. That's a different issue, though!  Good luck! =)"

Your dad is crazy, but most people's dads here are crazy, and he's still a human being and a father that probably wants the best for you. He just doesn't know what the best for you is; that's something you're gonna have to teach him. You can do it. :)"

ABCDesis,383kpi,Tipoe,7,Mon Jun 1 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"Well, don't know what to tell you then. There are options if you want to move out, as it seems. Just have to suck it up and perhaps do a job you don't love for a while.   Edit: as someone who's been in sorta your position, I get your trepidation, OP. You want to have the freedom to do what you want, but you also don't want to make any waves about it. Unfortunately, and I'm sorry that it's this way for a lot of desi kids, you can't have it both ways. You can:  a) keep lying and deal with your dad interfering with your life.  B) do something about it and take your freedom.   You can't have it without doing something about it though."
ABCDesis,383kpi,MachinShin2006,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with this, but I would say that if you're careful you CAN optimize the situation to have the MOST freedom to do what you want, and make the LEAST waves. From your situation OP, if you want to move out, look into things you can do after your Bachelor's that will give you the opportunity to move out. Any kind of grad school or professional school will give you that opportunity. These options can be expensive, so be careful. If you like research, consider getting a PhD in your field of interest. You will get paid to do research and it will buy you time to get used to living on your own. PM me if you want to learn more about this set of possibilities. PhD and research isn't for everyone (or even most people), so be careful.  Also, as /u/oinkyy mentioned below, you can earn enough on a biochem degree straight out of undergrad to support yourself. I would not recommend an MS in this field unless you get it paid for, but you could get some kind of lab tech job with just a Bahcelor's... anyway, point is, you have options. But yea, you will need to something about your situation or it's not going to change. Doesn't mean you have to be rash, you probably have better options than you think. Career-wise, PA is probably a great option, focus on that."
ABCDesis,383kpi,squarerootof-1,2,Wed Jun 3 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"FYI, as a biochem grad (who has many biochem grad friends), you can get an excellent job and be able to support yourself with your biochemistry degree. You can go the academic lab tech route (which may pay less, but trust me- as a graduate student who lives in DC and makes less than 30K a year, it's definitely possible to sustain yourself), or you can get a job as a researcher in industry, which, for fresh out of college, could pay up to 50 K. I know it's not a stellar income, but you want to go to PA school anyway- why not get a job for a couple of years and move out so you can have some peace of mind and center yourself before embarking on a new academic endeavor?"

Why are you studying a subject which will get you nowhere? Since you're far into your bachelors, abandoning it seems like a bad idea. Perhaps look at switching fields for masters or build some links/network and try and get a job in a related field. I see from your post that you didn't enjoy xyz and switched, you're not going to enjoy anything 100%, every field has pros and cons. It might take 2-3 years but that's the only way you'll get independence.  In the mean time, do what you need to make your life easier.

Also, while I agree with everyone else that the only way to end this is to become independent, I know it's not always possible or easy. For now, just see how much you can compromise and work on becoming independent on the side. You didn't do anything wrong and you shouldn't feel bad about lying. Your parents should feel bad about making you feel guilty for being normal. Just toe the line for a while longer, things will work out (I hope!)."

And a part of that is living your own life where you aren't under such tight control of your parents. (Which might sounds scary, i'm sure).  Also, the other commenters are right, you shouldn't be moving forward towards a career that you already KNOW won't let you get you a life outside of your parents.   Also, you're wrong in that you need to get back your parents' trust. They need to get backs yours. When he calls your work, and asks THEM where you are.. that is affecting your credibility at work, and actually impacting your long-term future. They need to grow the fuck up, you're 21.  You need to start asserting your independence from them, i.e., be more American and less Desi :)   1) I'm not saying this will be easy, it'll be fucking hard as hell, but in the long run, it's better for you and them.   2) If I sound upset or angry, it's cause I am (and, imo, so should you)."

Maybe it is because I see both sides to the situation, or maybe it is because i have seen someone get caught up in the lies and eventually caused them to spin out of control.   I want you to put yourself in your parents shoes. Yes they are crazy and over react to every situation. But until you have kids of your own, you would never understand how much you want to protect them. Bad choice to lie to your parents.    A) because of what happened in your situation/ getting caught and losing trust.  B) things could go wrong (aka you can get abducted / missing / raped) and they would not know what to do (I have seen it happen to one of my friends and though the girl was okay, she went missing for over 24 hours and the parents were going crazy). C) There is always a reputation to maintain when it comes to desi families.    Now what do you do because it happened already and you are stuck in a conundrum. Well apologize to your dad, saying it was a stupid mistake to lie. Say you promise you wont lie again because you know it will worry them. If you have siblings, let them in on what you are going to do (aka. seeing a boy etc), if you trust they wont tell it to your parents. But atleast that way, they can cover for you. If not, find a close friend that you confide in and tell your parents that you are going to see her/him. Tell him that you love him for checking up on you at work and that you understand he does it out of love. But because he does that, your coworkers have started joking if he would call them everyday you have to work.   Your parents may not have the same ideals and cultural background as you, but showing that you are mature in your decisions help ease their worries. Sometimes, talking it out is a lot easier than you think it is. It worked for me when i grew up (Yes i know im a guy and most desi parents are more lenient on guys than girls, but that did not stop my mom.)"
ABCDesis,383kpi,BONER_Q_EINSTEIN,3,Mon Jun 1 21:11:26 2015 UTC,I agree with part of what you're saying but I agree a bit more with /u/BONNER_Q_EINSTEIN because this advice is geared toward children and that's what I felt like reading it. I know it's never right to lie to your parents but I sometimes have to with mine to go be allowed to go anywhere. If I didn't lie about going to work I would have just lied and said I went to school...
ABCDesis,383kpi,ThisIsMyProfile,-1,Mon Jun 1 22:07:07 2015 UTC,"NO gosh i did not intend for that. I'm speaking partly in your parents perspective, partly as an older sibling of sorts. Having said that, yes you are still a child as much as you don't like to be called that. Your parents see you as their little girl still till the day you would get married or have a career. Either way, yes i get it you have to lie about certain things. But you need backup to cover your story. My gf had her siblings to lie to her parents when we used to go on dates. Her parents knew she was close to her siblings and they usually knew what each other were up to. When i first started hanging out with friends / dating, i lied about who i was hanging out with. But my parents knew my friends and they have checked up on me by calling them (obviously they knew where i was and covered for me)."

ABCDesis,3850n0,darthrevan,4,Tue Jun 2 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"First off, my heart just goes out to you.  All that pressure, all the conflicting priorities.  You love your parents, don't want to hurt them, want to do the right thing and take care of the family if your father no longer can...but you also don't want give up on yourself and your own happiness either.  I haven't been in your situation, so I don't feel qualified to give you specific advice.  Hopefully someone else here can.  But I did want to address this:   Even though my sister just became a pharmacist and has a job lined up, my parents refuse to take her money (old school thought) if she wanted to help out and she would be getting married shortly anyways so her helping us is out of question.   This makes absolutely no sense to me.  My wife (Indian) sends money to help support her family all the time and me & my family (also Indian) have never ever had a problem with it.  I know other Desi families where it's also totally fine.  As for your parents refusing to accept her money, that's just totally stupid and impractical.  If they're in a jam, they need the money, and your sister is able and willing to provide it, then it's ridiculous to refuse it and insist the burden be upon you for no other reason than that you happened to be born male (ladies who think men face no issues because of their gender, take note).   Now how you get your parents to see this, I have no idea.  Maybe talk to your sister, and together the two of you can get your parents to see reason and maybe be more flexible about all of this?  Whatever happens, I'm glad you reached out.  Just don't get to a point where you think you'll never be able to be happy, that's definitely not true.  Your life may not go the exact route you wanted, but there are many ways to be happy in life.  Take it one day at a time, and make the best choices available to you each moment.  Eventually you can find a path that, if not ideal, at least won't be so bad as you're worried it'll be."

They could accept your money once you become a physician. If their situation was that bad, mom could get a job. ""what will happen to us when your father is fired?

I'd be so much debt, wouldn't be able to match into whatever specialty I wanted to go into due to the stress, and would just become suicidal. Mom's too lazy. She doesn't want to learn how to drive or work and she is perfectly healthy. All she does is cook and read on her ipad and taunt me for no reason. Sigh.

If you want to change your major to accounting/finance, but you're still interested in medicine, have you considered taking some of the pre-med courses while having that major? It's not necessary to be a science major to get into med school as long as you have all the proper science coursework done. So you could still be an accounting/finance major, but still take your biology, chemistry, and physics classes.   Many people I know in college are deciding to take the nontraditional route by majoring in something else and taking a few years off in between undergraduate and medical school to work. You would be able to make some money with an accounting or finance job in that time to support your parents and yourself, and it can help you figure out whether you still want to go towards medicine or if you might enjoy accounting/finance. Granted, you will still need to maintain a good GPA, so you would have to decide for yourself whether something like that could be feasible."

ABCDesis,38569s,Tal-IGN,8,Wed Jun 3 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"I had no idea it was weird for Desis to like peanut butter or red velvet cupcakes o_O. It's not really anything weird among the Desi people I know.  I also know a lot of Desi people that are interested in anime/Miyazaki films, but they're mostly Desi guys. I actually don't know that many Desi girls that are interested in stuff like anime."

ABCDesis,38569s,plume-of-cat,2,Tue Jun 2 01:14:42 2015 UTC,Aww :)    btw have you been reading any of the light novels or Naruto Gaiden? They're spoiling us.
ABCDesis,38569s,Nylese,2,Tue Jun 2 02:18:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't had time with the light novels, I glanced and didn't realize it was just straight chapters.  I keep meaning to download the straight text and read it on an airplane.  I got distracted by some other books to be honest.  Naruto Gaiden after last week FINALLY got interesting... I was gonna let it go if it didn't go anywhere...It's a bit much at the moment, but I'll see where it goes.  I Just don't understand how so many secret jutsus and people and live in hiding for so long...  I really need a replacement anime/manga.  One Piece bores me... I've been a disgusted fan with Bleach for so long...have you dibble dabbled in anything new lately? I prefer staying in shonen manga with deep character development."

ABCDesis,38569s,frackaracka,4,Tue Jun 2 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"Ehh I mean, there are a lot of Desi foods I don't like and I don't feel weird about that. My specific Desi subgroup doesn't really have those two foods. I've only had (vegetable) biryani once or twice in a restaurant, and I'm vegetarian so I've never had haleem. There are also many other dishes I would prefer to my own subgroup's dishes. I don't think liking PB or red velvet over Desi foods is much of an issue."

Non Desis will say something like 'wow that's different for a Pakistani girl' and find it interesting but a lot of Desi people will find my interests 'weird' or say I'm ""like a white girl"" and that makes me feel like I can't be Desi and have different interests without being judged for it by other Desis"

ABCDesis,380lpb,Anandya,5,Mon Jun 1 03:20:57 2015 UTC,But I think I get her when she says that. Because your want one extreme to balance out the other because you need to show the other side.
ABCDesis,380lpb,rofosho,3,Mon Jun 1 15:44:31 2015 UTC,But isn't that just harmful in the long run? Its like to be accepted you have to be just like them. And if you insist on holding onto anything related to your heritage you become a source of comedy. There is no inbetween. Most people fall somewhere inbetween and are trying to balance both cultures. I would like to see that more.
ABCDesis,380lpb,LotusEyes92,2,Mon Jun 1 22:38:54 2015 UTC,But you need to have a counter balance. You need to show that an character who is played by an Indian actor is just a character. Just John doe. The first thing a person sees when watching that about isn't a skin color and preconceived notions. Just like how gay actors don't always have to play gay people on tv.
ABCDesis,380lpb,rofosho,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:47:07 2015 UTC,Yes you need to show other extreme too. But what I mean is you can't only have extremes. Show the people who take part in both cultures too.
ABCDesis,380lpb,LotusEyes92,2,Tue Jun 2 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"Right, but we don't. Community had abed and you saw how he had to deal with typical Indian parents.

While I don't respect that cheapening of journalism, I don't begrudge people the freedom to read/watch/listen to whatever crap they want. The only time I take umbrage is when they belittle serious matters like the treatment of minorities by American media. Buzzfeed's audience isn't serious about anything, and anything that graces their pages becomes, by definition not a serious matter. So, I'd prefer that they stick to 30 lifehacks or the latest Bruce Jenner news because, yknow, being Indian is actually my life."

There have been a lot of Urdu-speaking Muslims from Bihar and UP arriving to Mumbai, and they haven't been treated as greatly from the Hindus. However, they don't really harbor any such feelings for Marathi-speaking Muslims because they view the Marathi-speakers as being one of them.  Granted, I don't know if this is because many Biharis and UP-ites are poor, so the Marathi Hindus may also be hostile toward Bihari and UP-ite Hindus but I'm not exactly sure.   But I think there is a feeling that Hindus would be more comfortable with Muslims that speak local languages like Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam, etc than maybe Urdu, although this is my own personal experience."

I think many Indians have the idea that Urdu is a Muslim language, and many Indian-Americans in the West may also think like that because of stuff like Bollywood that portray Muslims as speaking Mughal-era Urdu and spend their free time reciting Urdu poetry or qawwalis or something.   I guess because of that, it probably seems unusual to them to see non-Urdu speaking Muslims.

Most Indian Muslims I know speak Urdu or a colloquial language unique to Muslims. And if they don't - well, it's their business. I think some people would be surprised at that, but would they go as far as not call them ""real Muslims""? That's a new one, sorry.   Why do you think people from Bangladesh are not Desi? Is it that how you see the people of Bengal in general? Or is this how you see any non-Hindi/Urdu speaking people from the subcontinent?   As a born and raised Indian, I thought it applied to just us, and didn't want to lump Pakistanis/Bangladeshis/Lankans under 1 banner so I didn't refer to them as that. I was then told by a Bangladeshi that he called himself desi too, so it's been all good since then."
ABCDesis,380f9h,TaazaPlaza,2,Mon Jun 1 15:51:56 2015 UTC,I always thought desi meant South Asian. I didn't even know it had a different meaning.
ABCDesis,380f9h,TaazaPlaza,3,Mon Jun 1 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"As an Indian who was born in India and grew up there, I think I know what you mean.    A lot of North Indians don't know that non-Hindi speaking areas in India have significant Muslim populations. A lot of my friends from Delhi have the misconception that all Bengali-speaking Muslims are Bangladeshi immigrants (mostly illegal) and don't like to hire them for jobs, domestic service etc. I had to point to statistics to show them that the Indian state of West Bengal actually has a significant Muslim population, well above India's national average, and a majority of Muslims traveling to Delhi for work are in fact Indian citizens by birth. People in South Asia don't see South Asian as an ethnicity. They see themselves either in smaller linguistic ethnic groups like Punjabi, Bengali etc. or in terms of nationality like Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi etc. So when they use the term Desi (which means ""from the country"") outside India, most Indians refer to their nationalist identity and not a socio-cultural identity that is forged outside India (much like Asian is not an ethnic group but in the US, Asian refers to anybody from East and South-East Asia).   Within India, 'desi' means something similar to 'country' when used as an adjective. Hence, 'desi' people refers to country bumpkins, 'desi daaru' refers to country liquor or moonshine etc. Most Indians just don't get the context of a South Asian diaspora adopting a term in a foreign land to describe themselves as a group. They are using the term differently from the way you probably do."
ABCDesis,380f9h,akbar-great_chai-tea,3,Mon Jun 1 21:13:10 2015 UTC,I always thought desi meant South Asian. I didn't even know it had a different meaning.
ABCDesis,380f9h,TaazaPlaza,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"It came to mean South Asian a lot later when the diaspora adopted the name. In most Sanskrit-derived languages, ""desh"" refers to 'land'. People referred to places as the 'land of so-and-so people'. Hence, regions in eastern India where people spoke Bengali have been called Bangladesh for a long time in Bengali literature. North-Central India was called Maddhya Desh because it used to be the geographical centre of most northern Indian empires from the time of Ashoka.   When the idea of nationalism started taking roots in India in the 19th century, the entirety of British-controlled India started being referred to as 'desh'. With time and after partition, 'desh' came to mean country or nation-state.  'Des' is the way people who were not elite and educated used to pronounce 'desh'. Therefore, 'desi' came to mean people who were not elite and later, came to mean country bumpkins who travelled to cities looking for jobs. The British equivalent to this is something that is not ""posh"".  The word 'desi' generally has a connotation of rural society and often used negatively but sometimes can be associated with positive stereotypes of villagers, like ""desi ghee"" refers to pure ghee free of additives and chemicals.   When Indians from India arrived in countries with majority White populations, they often referred to themselves as 'desi' because they perceived themselves to be the underclass and it was a sort self-deprecating joke that the elite gentleman in India has now become a 'desi' in a foreign land. A lot of new immigrant Indians still believe in this and use this self-deprecating tone.  With time, the diaspora has adopted the word 'Desi' as an ethnic or cultural indicator but for a lot of new immigrant, this is still a self-deprecating way of referring to themselves.  Thus ends my thesis on desiness!"
ABCDesis,380f9h,akbar-great_chai-tea,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:04:51 2015 UTC,Des is the tadbhava form of desh. Not necessarily how poor people pronounce it.

You are right about the burdern thing; sometimes it's easy to get a little too comfortable. My parents are just more jaded because not many of the people they help out remain in touch when they got on their feet. We've had lots of issues with people so my parents no longer help people out.   Mini rant: my cousin (dad's brother's son) wanted to come to the US for grad school in computer science. My mother was already concerned that we'd have to house this cousin so she was kicking up a fuss ever since the idea came up. My dad used to teach at a local no name university (read: low low standards) so he sent my cousin's application along to some folks he knew. Didn't hear back for awhile. Dad meets with dean, turns out my cousin had a terrible transcript and even this university wouldn't accept him. My mother is not so secretly happy about this.  Edit: do you think all of this tension between family members is because our culture tells us that we need to be super generous at all times? Because we are told that we should place our family's needs/desires ahead of our own? I say this because my mother never sees the need for staying at a hotel if we are visiting family/friends and would probably force herself to host family members then complain about it for ages (okay that last part may just be my mother)."
ABCDesis,37ypas,recycledpaper,7,Sun May 31 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"I've had the exact opposite experience as the other commenters, it seems. Over the past 50 years, my Dad (and later on, my Mom too) have helped countless families get settled here. They've sponsored citizenship, helped people read the fine print on the paper work, hosted newly arrived families, and even helped financially if it was feasible. This wasn't limited only to our relatives, either. From my perspective, we had a fairly constant revolving door of long-term visitors in our home. I always thought it was cool.  One such houseguest was my cousin's prospective husband. He had begun medical school in India but found himself unable to transfer any of his credits to US schools. So, he stayed with us and got a job pumping gas at a local station. The idea was to save up a bit and start anew at an American med school. I was only like 8 when this all went down, so the details might be off. Long story short, he's pumping gas and chatting with some guy who says, ""You know an awful lot for a guy working the pump"". Turns out this guy was director of something or other at some medical school. They swapped info, the guy pulled some strings, and my jeeja ji (sp?) is now a seriously well known radiologist. He and my cousin split up several years ago, though. Still, I love that story.  As far as I know, there hasn't been any falling out or resentment on the part of the emigrants, though you'd really have to ask them. At least outwardly, there seems to be nothing but the deepest gratitude. In fact, we threw my Dad a 50th-Anniversary-In-America surprise party earlier this year (he landed January 24th 1965), and the turnout and enthusiasm from everyone wanting to help or contribute or show their gratitude in some way was downright beautiful. It was to the point where my brother and I had to insist that we were paying and that they just needed to show up and have a good time.  I guess I'm lucky that I didn't have to see the ugly side of this because I'm not jaded about this sort of thing at all. I try to help the same way my parents did."
ABCDesis,37ypas,VictorShakapopulis,4,Sun May 31 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when I was <2 years old so I have no memory except for my mom mentioning it.   My uncle (dad's side) was the financial sponsor to a lot of family, but his wife made sure they'd never host, so the hosting fell on my parents.  Some aunts and cousins lived with us for a few weeks, others lived for a few months.    My mom is still mad that she had to do ALL the hosting this to this day (she holds grudges for a long time) and I have zero relationship with my uncle because of this.  One story she shares with me is that literally before I was born she baked some things so she can have it after she came home from the hospital and when she returned, she saw my cousin indulging on these sweets.  (Being a parent today, I can't imagine coming home with a newborn AND being a long-term host simultaneously)  The aunts went back home after their boys were ""settled"" and have done very well for themselves.

ABCDesis,37ypas,yougoglencocox,5,Sun May 31 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"About five years ago, out of the blue - my uncle and my parents received phone calls from a distant cousin of mine and his wife that they had landed in Canada after buying some papers from someone in Punjab. Naturally, when they landed, Canadian border officials knew the documents were BS and locked them up in holding to await deportation back to India.  They called my parents as well as my uncle in order to try to get help. Keep in mind here that no one knew they were coming - they just up and called one day after landing in Canada. My uncle scrounged up several thousands of dollars to pay for a lawyer and eventually, the lawyers were able to have them released into Canada (somehow). My uncle ended up having to be their sponsor and put up $10,000 as a guarantor.   The relatives were set to go to court not too long after landing in order to sort out their immigration status and go through the motions of staying here on a longer term basis. They had decided to stay with some other relatives about 5-6 hours away. Many weeks later, my uncle received a notice in the mail that the two relatives had missed their court date and had been unreachable by other means. This meant that my uncle lost the $10,000 guarantee and the two relatives were now being actively pursued by the CBSA for deportation.   My uncle was livid - after all, how hard would it have been to just show up for court? He called up these relatives and they begged him not to turn them in - that they didn't know what to do, didn't want to go to court, etc etc etc... That being said, they had since moved and refused to tell my uncle where they lived. This was a pretty big conflict for my uncle - he didn't want to turn his relatives in; but at the same time, he has a chronic illness and $10,000 is no small amount of money for him to lose considering that he was out of work. Had they owned up to it and taken the deportation, my uncle would've been able to get some of the money back. They wouldn't even approach the court to try and work something out.  In any case, I am not sure how - but someone ended up turning them in and they were deported from the country. However, because of the time delay, the $10,000 was lost. When they went back to India, they talked mad shit about my uncle and his family - how inhospitable they were, how they didn't help at all, and so on...  This is not an uncommon story by any means and why I would be extraordinarily wary about helping any relatives or recent immigrants. I've heard far too many stories about people being super shitty and taking advantage."

So because desis misunderstand and misuse Hinduism it's okay for white Americans to do so?   No of course it's not OK for anyone --white, brown, whatever--to misuse it; but my point is that if you're going to get on your high horse and act like the problem is ""things white people do LOL!"", well guess what: just being Desi (which are the only ""credentials"" anyone has presented so far?) doesn't somehow magically give you authority and credibility to criticize it.  Being a devout Hindu gives you that credibility, yet I'd bet almost everyone upvoting this post is probably not chanting mantras and doing puja everyday.  Yet somehow just being Desi makes you a more ""legit"" Hindu?  That's the assumption--not uncommon in our community--that I find despicable.  How many of you (if you're Hindu) even post about Hindu anything on your Facebook?  Pretty sure Hanuman probably appreciates sincere, if misguided, devotion to him rather than not giving a fuck about him at all.  To quote Jesus: ""Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"" (Matthew 7:3)  Ultimately it's a bit ridiculous to bitch about a freaking Facebook post that at worst was a bit irreverent, attribute it to ""well white people be so whitey"", and meanwhile your own culture does way, way worse things in the name of ""our Hindu culture/values"" than calling Hanuman their homeboy on social media (latest example)."
ABCDesis,37xdub,darthrevan,2,Sun May 31 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"I totally see your point, but    Not necessarily on a high horse and I personally do think it's important to criticize white people when they do this because it remains an issue of white people ridiculing marginalized people. It's just as important to look at our own community and injustices done there. Who is going to decide what being devout means? I think that your point here makes sense but ethnicity and religion are intertwined here, especially with the case of Hinduism ( as apposed to Islam for example), so from that point it can be explained why desis speak with a voice of authority. The privilege/marginalization thing is at play here as well.  I completely disagree with this way of thinking re: the Jesus quote. I normally do think it is better to focus inwards rather than to point fingers so I do see where you are coming from AND it is incredibly important to Focus on our own issues (that article shows something truly awful) but it is also important to be able to critique the rest of the world and I personally think it should be possible to do both. According to the logic of ONLY focusing inwards there is just a lot of injustice that will be ignored (even though I'm sure that quote does not mean it like that) and I personally do view these facebook posts in a larger context of inequality.   So I think you are right in some ways but I still disagree because I am looking from a different vantage point. Your critique of desis is valid but also assumes there is a certain way of being devout that gives one credibility which I don't agree with. Even if desis are unrightfully speaking from a place of authority, I am not sure if that makes their critique any less valid.  Also there are many different ways that Hinduism is taught. I have been taught that devotion is not as important and that hinduism is a philosophy for me to think about and see if it can guide me so even though I might practice it differently, I don't see why I wouldn't have the authority to speak on it if I consider myself Hindu."

I live in Southern California, and maybe you're not from here and don't get to see some of the small communities of mixed race temples and stuff like that here on the beaches, but trust me, they exist. Yes, many whites you'll see tattooing an Om to their ankle or something stupid and cheapening like that. Not saying that doesn't exist or even doesn't happen regularly. But people who know what they're doing and are not Desi also exist, and I think it would be great if we could learn about this and not react by denying my experiences going to temples run by these white priests and pujaris.

We may ask the ultimate blasphemous question: can the West learn something of value from the Caste System?, Arranged Marriage? Elaborate public rituals? Almost religious respect and deference towards the elderly?   Is Indian society morally superior, on par with, or inferior to Western society?

I'm curious because I'm Indian Bengali and my Bangladeshi friends will eat the same traditional Bengali foods as us, but they will have no idea what Gujarati dhokla is, or South Indian idli, or Mumbai style pav bhaji, but we, being from India, have at least some exposure to foods from different regions or ethnic groups, and incorporate them into our diet, at least once in a while."

Many South Indian communities like this have assimilated with the rest of Pakistan, but, there do remain a few that stand out.

The whole thing is FUBAR."

ABCDesis,37raq7,TaazaPlaza,14,Sat May 30 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate this person's honesty and frankness. Often, it's damn near impossible to discuss the issue of caste with folks like my parents and other Indians I know (who are all from higher castes & are always, always bitching about quotas for college admissions or government jobs) in an honest, open way.   This may be a stretch, but in a way, I tend to empathize more with Muslims/SC/ST people living in India given my own experiences with discrimination as a person of color in the United States. The part of subtle discrimination and lowered / different expectations especially hit home with me."
ABCDesis,37raq7,feetintheair12,10,Sat May 30 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with the quota system is it doesn't take into account wealth. You can be insanely poor and upper caste. So some village temple Brahmin is treated like he's gotten every single leg up needed in life while the SC guy who comes from a family of millionaires still counts as SC. The quotas need to have some common sense applied to them.   So, I would not need quotas as much since I come from a family of doctors despite being SC/ST. However my great irritation is that people often judge me and are ""surprised"" when I speak."
ABCDesis,37raq7,Anandya,2,Fri May 29 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with the quota system is it doesn't take into account wealth.    It was not meant to address wealth distribution. It was for equal distribution of govt. resources like education subsidies and govt. jobs.   They did add a feature called ""creamy layer"" to address wealth, but it is much easier to hide your wealth that it would be to hide your caste. That shit is going with you to your grave."

She's smart but not exactly Indian school smart, so her grades weren't that good. To most people here, school smart is the only smart that counts. Low scores equal you being dumb, or a makku in Tamil. Apparently some of the kids' parents were like, ""But she's fair! How can she be a makku?""  In the second case, a friend who is pretty dark teaches kids at a similar thing. She usually dresses pretty well and carries herself with confidence. She was at a classroom early, and talking to the maid. The maid told her (in Tamil of course), ""You look like you're illiterate. Only when you talk I can tell that you're educated"".

ABCDesis,37rj51,Tipoe,6,Fri May 29 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"I know this is a really long video and I’m going to try to summarize the main points as best as I can, but I recommend all of you guys to take time to watch the entire video.  What Sarah talks about here is that ex-Muslims are stuck in a weird place in American society. Many ex-Muslims tend to be liberal atheists, agnostics, or deists, and their experiences in coming out to their families vary from acceptance to being ostracized from their family and friends to losing their mental health or even their lives. Many ex-Muslims also come from immigrant families, so they are also people of color.   Sarah gives an example on writing an article criticizing some of Reza Aslan’s claims about Islam. Instead of receiving criticism about the article and its claims, many Muslims and liberals were attacking her character and questioning her intentions and motives, instead of addressing the claims. When it comes to criticizing Christianity and how the religious right is trying to force religious principles, many liberals very openly offer their support. When it comes to Islam, critics of Islam are usually viewed as right wing bigots. For ex-Muslim critics, the word bigot can’t be used since many ex-Muslims are POC, so they use descriptors such as pro-war or Uncle Tom or House Arab or native informant, which gives the implication that atheists from Muslim families are betraying their “own kind.”  The main issue she talks about is that many conflate criticism of Islam with criticizing Muslims, which is not the same. Many ex-Muslims still have family members or friends that are still Muslim, so  many ex-Muslims would still be victims of discrimination from those same right wingers who criticize Islam and Muslims. But many ex-Muslims are unable to receive proper support from the left due to many people conflating the two. While many liberals are vocal in fighting against Muslim discrimination, when ex-Muslims talk about the problem that many apostates face in Islamic countries, they are told they are just making it a bigger deal than it is, making it seem like that ex-Muslim problems do not matter as much.  There is way more to this video that I probably would not be able to put into a single comment, such as having one ethical standard for Westerners and another for those in Muslim countries (ex. outrage if there was a law in the US stating converts to Islam should be executed, but the laws that criminalize apostasy from Islam in so many Islamic countries is not given any importance at all) or that liberals are not willing to talk about these difficult issues involving Islam, and the only ones talking about it are conservatives.  I highly recommend you guys to watch this entire video! (It's a Friday, you guys should have some spare time to watch this)  tl;dr Many people on the left mix up criticizing Islam with criticizing Muslims and are unwilling to properly talk about issues facing ex-Muslims throughout the world."

We're a tiny minority and I don't think life is getting easier as time progresses."
ABCDesis,37rj51,x6tance,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that some families are quite jaahil and what they wish to express, can't express properly so they become a source of hurt for the disbeliever. Talking about Muslim families dwelling in Western countries here, by the way. However, actual criticism and discussion about Islam has been conducted for ages in scholarly and academic circles.   Which is probably why I feel disconnected. I'm not sure if people tend to dislike Islam cause of fallacies found within the religion or their families are tools and used Islam as their weapon so they grew to contempt it. My family ranges from atheists to super devout and we all seem to get along fine. No one banishes the other from social circles. :/  Khair, interesting video. Something I know that happens but never witnessed it myself. When I've discussed Islam with ex-Muslims or within my family, we don't attack or make assumptions of their character. We talk strictly about Islam. Guessing Sarah is a Shia Jaafri which makes me curious as to her reasoning why she left. I normally hear Sunnis or something off the typical like Ismaili or Ahmadi."

That's why if you go on to r/Hapas a lot of kids are depressed.  They grow up with a white father who thinks that they are inferior and an Asian mother who thinks Asian men are attractive.

For those without cable, check out the fight thread on /r/Boxing to find streams.  If he wins this, we'll most likely get to see him being a part of a huge fight against Mayweather. It would really be super cool to see a South Asian displace the pound for pound king, considered by many as one of the greatest pound for pound fighters ever (though I totally disagree with this assessment).  Interesting factoid:   Freddy Roach (Manny's current coach) used to be Amir Khan's coach until 2012. Many consider Freddy Roach - Manny Pacquiao to be one of the best coach-fighter combos. It'll be amazing if Amir could do what Manny couldn't (knockdown Mayweather).  With his speed and age (he's only 28) he has a good shot at Mayweather. Let's show support by watching the big fight and hoping he wins!"

Canelo could legitimately beat Mayweather right now.  Honestly though, the buildup to the Garcia TKO is something Money could have avoided entirely with his perfect defense. Only a TKO or KO by Khan will even put him in the conversation, but even that I feel like is a pipe dream."

Look what a crafty Harerra did to Garcia, he poses no threat to Floyd and he isn't really even campaigning for this fight.  Not saying Khan will beat Maywheather but it is by far the most interesting match up. Khans never been out boxed and Floyd hasn't really had a legitimate knockout since Hatton. With his speed and range Khan brings something new to the table and it'll be interesting to see how Floyd adjusts to that."

The fact is he has a pretty impressive resume, and he is one of the few fighters who Mayweather would look at, the ball is in Mayweather's court, as he has a habit of cherry picking opponents, and u bet that he will take a close look at Amir, from not only a boxing perspective but also a marketing perspective (with the whole Ramadan thing).   And yes he lost to Garcia, but he did redeem himself with the Devon Alexander fight. Also, if anybody has doubts if Amir deserves a shot against Floyd, they need to check out Amir's fight against Maidana, particularly round 10. Amir kept taking hits, and multiple hooks, looked so wobbly that you would think Maidana would end the fight that round, he not only survived that round, but went to win the 12 round fight. That just shows pure heart to not give up and stand on your feet after receiving blows like that. His fight against Maidana shows that he atleast deserves to be given a shot."

ABCDesis,37qsyr,analystdude,18,Fri May 29 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"In US and a number of western countries, parents convenience is paramount. So you will see babies/toddlers eating at 5.30-6pm, sleeping at 6.30-7pm, sleeping in their own room and so on. Children are separated from society as much as possible and baby sitters are a big part of society.   In other countries (including Argentina, India and a number of developing countries), kids are an integral part of the society and the expectation is that kids will cause a disturbance and the society bears it. In such places, kids eat with the parents, sleep around 9-10pm, partake in festivities if any, go/are taken to restaurants, movies etc.   From your observation, I think you are in an area with a large number of first generation immigrants who have just moved from India.

My parents have always brought me almost everywhere they go (especially since I hated daycare), and I've noticed it among other Desi groups as well. I asked why, and they said that there's just not as much of a concept of individuality or alone time for parents. My parents still go out alone very rarely (they were also a love marriage so that may play a part), but they really enjoyed taking us places. They sacrificed a lot for us, too; I can't imagine how frustrating it would be only watching kids movies at the theater, and there was even one scenario when they said no to a Desi wedding because kids weren't invited and they wanted us to have the experience. I feel a lot of Desi parents invest a lot of time and their own life into their kids, which is why they later find it hard to let go. My father thankfully told me that he and Mom have plenty of other interests to go on after my sister and I leave the house, but not all parents are easily like that.   However, one thing my parents always emphasized was discipline. If I wasn't disciplined properly, I wouldn't go, period. I guess they sacrificed once in a while on that account too, but at least it provided a crucial incentive for me to behave."
ABCDesis,37qsyr,x6tance,6,Fri May 29 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"this is something my mom used to say when I asked why we never had a babysitter: ""I didn't have kids just to leave them at home and go out.""  Which I think is totally true."
ABCDesis,37qsyr,SabashChandraBose,4,Sat May 30 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"Discipline was key. I find that kind of the same in the town I grew up in, desi or not: your kids can't behave? Babysitter or stay home. Part of having kids is not getting to do everything."
ABCDesis,37qsyr,IzmailPirzada,3,Sat May 30 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Growing up in India, it's just a given that there will be some background noise here and there whether that's someone who makes a comment on the movie or a baby crying. To be honest, it doesn't really bother me, but, I grew up with a different set of customs and societal norms.   The folks are oblivious to what is normal in America. Many of them come from middle of nowhere in Andhra and surround themselves with their own kind to get by in America, so, their American view is quite limited. It can't be helped. Their kids will be more aware of the societal norms when they go through schooling here.   Anyways, when I saw Indian movies a while back here, I didn't encounter any of that issues. Could be region specific. But at the same time, we don't have a big population of NRIs either.   The ratio may be higher since we are flooded with many H1 Visa Indians and going to an Indian restaurant or watching an Indian movie is definitely going to attract our kind over others, lol!"
ABCDesis,37qsyr,bug-bear,3,Fri May 29 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"I used to be like that. Then I put myself in the parents' shoes. You have a toddler who is always demanding your attention. It has greater financial, emotional, physical, nutritional needs than any other person in your life. After a few months of being a slave, you are done with this jailed life of yours. If you are a woman, especially, you just want to go out and knock down a couple of drinks (if you like to drink) or get your nails painted or whatever it is that is fun. So you tentatively decide to explore this new world outside where you can go with your new bundle of joy.   Where do you go?  Not to bars, surely or other adult places you used to hangout until this food monster entered your life. And if you are one of those helicopter parents who wants to shush people when they swear around your golden angel, most places are out of reach.   Thus: restaurants, theme parks, parks, movie theaters (G-reated only), etc.  I avoid all of those like the plague now.  I still maintain that babies should be given a mild and harmless sedative on planes. Or conversely, I'd pay about 15-30$ more for a guaranteed no baby on board airlines."
ABCDesis,37qsyr,IndianAmericanteen,3,Fri May 29 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"This is not a Desi thing. It is dependent on family to family, and whether they instruct their children on the etiquettes of being in public.  I was taken out everywhere as a child but understood that unless my diaper was loaded I wasn't entitled on causing an uproar where ever I may be. Also my parents took the steps necessary to make me comfortable outside, such as feeding me before we went to dinner parties so that I wouldn't whine at the venue, or making sure I had adequate sleep prior to an outing at night.   This has nothing to do with whether your folks called South Asia home, its basic parenting."

ABCDesis,37mfa6,crazygama,12,Thu May 28 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking a very dark view of this based on your own assumptions.  Listen to what the kid actually said:   ""I like to learn. So I just followed my passion of learning, and that's how I ended up here,"" he told Fox News.   I was sadly not one of them, but there are people out there for whom things like math or science or some other subject area is their ""gameboy"".  They get really excited about it and can study for hours with full energy, just like the rest of us can do worthless bullshit for hours.  (Reddit...cough, cough...)  You make it sound like this kid was locked in a dungeon, beaten for days, and did his homework with ink made from his blood mixed with tears.  Yet for some kids doing their homework and achieving academic success is actually a joy.  He probably graduated so fast because (a) he was home-schooled, meaning he could advance at his own pace rather than be artificially held back by grade levels; and (b) he just went full throttle on what he loved doing, not because his parents were holding a gun to his head shouting ""Grow up now or else! No fun, only study!""  In other words, this kid is probably living a dream life for himself based on what he loves doing.  I don't feel bad for him at all.  If he plays his cards right, he'll hit success early and have the time & money to be like a kid the rest of his life and play with whatever he wants...while the rest of us who wasted time on gameboys will have only a long and hard adult life of drudgery to look forward to.  tl;dr: this image"

Join makers fair, do one of the dozens of science and math leagues across the country, do the fucking spelling competitions. I'm sure the kid would have been just as happy and fulfilled with excelling at any one of those things while still going to school, being with kids his age, looking at pretty girls, play pokemon, etc. Now, no more school, no more youth.

I still killed it in the 8th grade academically, but my social skills took long time to catchup. I was still thinking girls were gross when my classmates were trying to have babies. When I finally got interested in girls in the 9th/10th grades no classmate ever looked at me because I was a baby.

I run a filmblog on old Indian films and I have a great interest in historical clothing and hairstyles.  First off the 1950s style needs to be in a bun or a plait with a circlet of jasmine. Think of Nargis in Shree 420, very idealized virtuous Indian woman. The 1920s style reminds me of Kanan Devi or Sulochana, which is okay I guess. Actually I'm pretty sure that that whole look is an exact copy of a picture I have of Sulochana. The 1960s style looks like a modern interpretation of 'retro '60s' and not an actual sixties bouffant.   The make-up in most of these looks seems wrong to me. Also I vaguely remember '80s styles in India when they were in fashion originally, and the side plait thing seems really wrong. They seem to have gone with some variation of this in every video. What I remember women wearing from that time were those big, loose, tumbling curls like Madhuri Dixit in her early days.   And the faces definitely need to be paler. I mean, that WAS the ideal."
ABCDesis,37h9ae,book-of-kells,7,Wed May 27 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"Also, looking at the Pinterest page, they used Mughal-e-Azam as the inspiration for the 1940s. But that movie didn't come out until 1960 and was set in the Mughal era.   And I've done the 'Nargis look' that they copied for the vid for the '50s. I achieved much better results, because like Nargis I used wet set and pin curl pins to set my hair. Lastly, the '50s look needs some kind of flowers, like jasmine/lotus/orchid/lily/rose."

ABCDesis,37h9ae,book-of-kells,7,Wed May 27 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it'd be difficult to make a video of, say, middle class India throughout the years and have it not be utterly boring. Because in my community at least, women were forbidden from wearing make-up and getting fancy hairstyles. The only change there would have been would be the style of the saree, the materials and the type of weaving and print, and also the way it was arranged."
ABCDesis,37h9ae,asdfioho,7,Wed May 27 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Probably, was just noting it. Iran's video for example used middle-class fashion. The fashion for women (and men) in different regions will also be drastically different from one another."

This is my daily use cologne. Prada Infusion D'Homme by Prada: Good for day outings; it's nice and floral and not at all overwhelming. Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb: This was suggested to me by /u/elle_reve and is quickly becoming one of my favorites. It's really heavy so a little spritz goes a long way.
ABCDesis,37h740,hahaheehaha,6,Wed May 27 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"I was hoping you would post. I always use you as my example.   I've been told a few times go for the musky scent (even had a girl recommend the last one to me also), but people fail to realize that it has to work with your natural scent as well. Just because you like the scent it doesn't mean it meshes well with your natural scent, soap, and deodorant. I know lots of people who just buy a cologne that their friend uses or gf recommended and just drown themselves in it because the scent doesn't last long. No it won't if it is competing against contrasting scents. Everything should compliment. If you do it that way the cologne will last longer and work better.   My colognes are more bright with citrus tones: FCUK and burberry seem to have the better choices for me."

Desi aunties/uncles are notorious for not giving a fuck if other people's lives are completely ruined.  I know far too many miserable Desi women stuck in horrible, horrible marriages.    Yes it will be a bunch of drama and yelling, screaming, etc...but this is your cousin's life at stake.  If it must happen, at least make a fuss so that you can sleep at night.  You don't want to have to watch her be miserable for (potentially) the rest of her life and deep down know you might have been able to do something.    Interesting to call this guy ""Ram"" of all things.  Ram and Sita were actually extremely horny for each other (no really, try to read a good translation of the Ramayana and not ""Sunday school"" versions), but there was always a foundation of respect, love, and reverence for one another.  I bring this up because lewdness, coarseness, etc.--all the things this guy is doing--are really, really bad signs of a terrible character.  I'm sure it's indicative of other areas in his life where he's pretty bad.  So yeah, do what you can to stop this.  It's clear you know where you stand on it, so just take every opportunity to do what you can and do not give a shit what uncles/aunties think.  (Actually, that's a good rule in general.)  Even if ultimately you're powerless to stop it, you tried your best.    Really, you don't want to see what happens to a woman who's married to a horrible man for years and years.  I just witnessed this close up and my heart nearly broke seeing the pain and misery this woman is going through.  If I'd had a chance to stop it (I didn't know her at the time), holy crap I would have done anything I could.  P.S.

Even better if the concerned cousins also join you in this.  (Are any of those concerned male? That would help, sadly.)  I want to remind everyone about this: (crisis resources)[http://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/2555oa/rabcdesis_crisis_resources/]"
ABCDesis,37fbpl,hpboy,11,Wed May 27 15:16:42 2015 UTC,So this Ram guy is the age to get married and he was asking your high schooler cousin to take her shirt off? Isn't your cousin underage? There is a law against that. You could tell Ram to call it off before and never look at a girl from your family else the only sex he'll be having is in prison.  Have you told your parents or the brides parents or anything that Ram is going around asking girls to strip?  I wouldn't make the bride feel worse about her situation by bad mouthing the future husband.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,pete_the_penguin,5,Wed May 27 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think that Ram is very good with getting the ""adults"" on his side. That is why calling him out will never work."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,VictorShakapopulis,4,Wed May 27 12:18:51 2015 UTC,If your high school cousin is under age and Ram can convince a Department of Justice  prosecutor to let him go. There is nothing that can be done.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,pete_the_penguin,1 point,Wed May 27 12:35:53 2015 UTC,"This.  The high school cousin can notify authorities. It's a very tough situation to put her in, but it would sound the right alarms even if Ram doesn't formally get arrested or anything.  But I get that that's an extreme step to take, and as I mentioned, it will be difficult for the high schooler to do. Hopefully, this thread comes up with a better option."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,trctn4238934,5,Wed May 27 12:37:46 2015 UTC,I feel like this girl deserves better than finding out later. Our culture looks down on divorced girls even if it isn't their fault.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,pete_the_penguin,5,Thu May 28 01:28:56 2015 UTC,The girl in India has to be cooperative for this. Will not work if the girl is not willing to go against her parents.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,espresso-patronum,3,Wed May 27 14:27:23 2015 UTC,The guy is asking underage high school girls to strip.  How is he not in jail? Any parent would back out from having their daughter  married to a person being bars.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,Fanboy0550,9,Wed May 27 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"Raise all hell. If that were my cousin, you had best believe that I would be making damn sure this guy doesn't get near her. The recording thing is a good idea.. maybe get a Bluetooth one and operate it remotely? Next time you're at an Indian gathering, know what room the boys are gonna be hanging out in (if they're anything like the ones I've been too, the boys always lock up in one room and hang out) and put the device in there beforehand. The just operate the recording mechanism with a remote.. I know that's some stealth mode shit but the thought of my sweet innocent cousins being decimated by such a man brings so much rage to me that I almost feel like it's my family."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,SabashChandraBose,4,Thu May 28 01:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think the best bet is to raise as much hell as possible with the help of your other cousins before they have an engagement. Once they are engaged, I don't think the adults will call it off. But you would have to be ready for the backlash."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,RotiRoll,2,Wed May 27 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"a) How old are Ram and Laxmi? How old are you? I feel that we are hearing one side of the story with one lewd incident from Ram. While that in itself was wrong for Ram to do, we don't know if that is all Ram is, and if your latent antipathy towards him has caused you all this angst. Just being objective here.  b) If it appears that you cannot convince Laxmi's and/or Ram's parents to stop the marriage, what you could do is convince Laxmi to keep her guard up. She probably could come to the US where her rights would be better protected. Tell her to be vocal about being uncomfortable with having sex the very night, etc. Her life seems to be controlled by authoritative parents, and she herself does not seem to have the temerity to break off and fly free. If she can stay together and leave the country, she could start her life afresh if she has that desire."

A grown man who is a family friend tried to coerce a high school girl to take off her top at a family gathering.  That's enough for me.  And no we're not hearing from Ram because this isn't Point-Counterpoint."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,frackaracka,3,Wed May 27 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"I am interested in the answers to your first point. I really don't want to sound insensitive, so please understand that I'm just trying to get a feel for the situation.  For example, I'm a guy. Have been my whole life, in fact. And in my time, I've heard lots of really douchey things said by other guys. Hell, I've said some incredibly dumb things. Some guys are insecure, so they brag about their exploits with women. Some guys are obviously gayer than Liberace, but they aren't comfortable coming out yet so they speak lewdly about sex in a transparent but forgivable cover up. Other guys -- particularly younger or less experienced ones -- are just trying to fit in by bluntly talking about seemingly perverse acts.  I'm not justifying or excusing any of that, but I do think that different audiences will interpret such comments differently. When I was a teenage virgin and heard dudes in their 20s telling me, ""you gotta be rude to chicks; it makes them want you more"", I assumed they knew what they were talking about and took their word as gospel. Now, 30 years and many girlfriends later, I will occasionally hear some kids spouting the same nonsense and just laugh at how misguided they are. If OP is a woman -- maybe even a younger woman who hasn't been exposed to the filthy shit that guys say to one another -- then she might think Ram is a pervert when he's really just a dipshit.  I have many cousin sisters, and I wouldn't want any of them marrying a dipshit, but that is something I can work with. A pervert is a different story. If you're confident that Ram is the latter, then stop at nothing. But just be sure of it before you do so that you don't create some lingering family issues that'll hurt you and Laxshmi and high school cousin.  Crappy advice, I know, but I think it's important to be aware of."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,VictorShakapopulis,5,Wed May 27 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"A grown man tells a high school girl to take her top off at a family gathering, and you think he's just being a regular dipshit?"
ABCDesis,37fbpl,frackaracka,2,Wed May 27 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"But that's why /u/SabashChandraBose asked how old Ram is. If he's, like, 20 and the cousin is 18... I mean, is that really such a big deal? And unless I'm missing something, Ram isn't related to high school cousin, is he? If they've been family friends and he had a crush on her growing up or something, then I again don't think this is really the worst offense.  When I first read this post, I was as outraged as everyone else. And then I read the question about everyone's ages and considered that all of this can be interpreted different ways based on that info."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,VictorShakapopulis,4,Wed May 27 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"It honestly doesn't matter how old they are. That's creep behavior, whether they're teens or close to their 20s."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,pete_the_penguin,2,Wed May 27 20:33:16 2015 UTC,Trying to justify a coercive action because of age and that it's been done since time immortal isn't going to earn you any points. Acting like a shithead and trying to get someone to do something through duress is inexcusable and age is irrelevant.
ABCDesis,37fbpl,VictorShakapopulis,2,Wed May 27 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"Not justifying it. Simply acknowledging that there are gradations of bad. If Ram is 50 and the cousin is 15, that's way worse than if he's 19 and she's 18.  Please, tell me I'm not alone in thinking that."
ABCDesis,37fbpl,trctn4238934,2,Wed May 27 21:31:14 2015 UTC,The OP said my highschool cousin. She is still in highschool as of today. That means she's not 18 yet even if she is going to senior year. The guy is at the age to get married in brown culture so mid to late 20s. Thats still illegal.

Surely, some emigration official inspects the passports of these bumpkins, and stamps them without ever telling them that they are walking towards their deaths.   It's 2015. We have information about the horrible slavery extant in the middle east, yet the GoI does shit to a) educate villagers b) offer help at the airports, and mainly c) help them once they are stranded abroad.  I have a conspiracy theory that the Gelf states have offered oil at a steep discount/cray bribes in exchange for a constant supply of sacrificial slaves."

GoI does things to educate migrants about the kafala system but a large number of them still decide to migrate in order to provide for their family.   Although education will help solve this problem, there's a lot to be said about cleaning up the recruitment process. It's horribly corrupt and full of broken promises.   The Philippines has had similar issues and they've started to make some strides in cleaning this process up a little which has helped alleviate the situation a bit.  TLDR: The Kafala System is not good but there's a lot that can be done at home to clean up corrupt recruitment practices."

There are people at airport that can provide assistance safely. My grandmother went to India by herself. They put her on a wheel chair (even though she can walk by herself without any help. It's just for the fact that English isn't her first language and by putting her in wheelchair). It helped the worker/volunteer to easily assist her and transported her from one gate to another gate.

ABCDesis,37bmsd,ShereOnFire,17,Wed May 27 10:26:10 2015 UTC,"It was a nice afternoon in Madras. The sun was out, and there was a pleasant afternoon breeze. Mrs.Varma flapped a bedsheet, ridding it free of the moisture. She dropped it over the clothesline, a nylon rope that has been strung across two tall coconut trees.  The neighbor, Mrs. Jayanthi, came out with a blue plastic bucket filled with her own laundry. The air smelt of detergent.  Mrs. Jayanthi retrieved a large, checked, full-sleeved shirt, and studied the collar for residual stains. Satisfied, she jerked the shirt about and tossed it onto the clothesline. With deft fingers, she pegged the shirt to the rope. Soon the wind animated the shirt, and it swung around like a marionette.  ""So, Jaya,"" said Mrs. Varma. ""You heard-aa? The news?""  ""What ya?"" replied Mrs. Jayanthi, biting down the frustration at her vainglorious neighbor. There wasn't a day when Mrs. Varma hadn't bragged about her husband's new bicycle bell, their new carpet, or their only, fat child's passing in all subjects as if that was a great achievement. Her own son was a class topper and the class-teacher told her, during the previous parents-teachers meeting, that he had a lot of potential to get into IIT. That lard-tub, Pinku, that obeast son of Mrs. Varma was destined to be a drug addict as far as Mrs. Jayanthi was concerned, but social etiquettes barred her from venting her thoughts. She gave a plastic smile, and fished out a black bra from her bucket.  ""So you know my brother, no? Living in the you-ess?"" Mrs. Varma cleared her throat, and puffed her chest. ""New york area?""  Jayanthi wanted to borrow a cup of sugar and milk for the shahi paneer she was going to prepare that evening, and she knew she had to satiate this mother of a hamplanet first before she could casually throw in that request. ""Who? That tall boy who got recently married? He-aa?""  Mrs. Varma grew to her full round shape. Her cheeks turned red. She placed her meaty arms on her ample waist, looking like a nether-beast from a Michelin ad. ""Yes! That boy only. He got married last year to that fair girl, remember? Lovely she was. Slender waist, so fair you had to wear cooling glasses to see her face."" Here she cackled. Jayanthi tittered to be civil. Mrs. Varma continued after wiping her eyes. ""Anyway, their neighbor, no...they live in a six-bedroom house, by the way.""  ""Who? The neighbors?""  ""What? Neighbor has only five. Chi chi! Not neighbors. My brother, Raju."" A great fountain of pride washed over the corpulent Mrs. Varma as her mind played images of Raju's townhouse with a red Mercedes parked in front.   ""Hello?"" Jayanthi snapped her fingers in front of Mrs. Varma. The latter snapped out of her daze. ""Ah! yes! So Raju's neighbors, no? Telugu people with some funny name.  Gummidpindi or Gudlungi. Haha.""  ""Ha ha!""  ""Their girl won the spelling competition.""  ""What spelling competition?"" Jayanthi was almost done with her clothes. She stood back and inspected her handiwork with pride. All shirts lumped together, sorted size wise, and within the size, color-wise. All the undergarments were nicely sandwiched between the shirts and flowing saris, and the entire thing wrapped around a couple of batik-styled bedsheets. Behind her, Mrs. Varma was talking.  ""The announcer tells a word, and the kids have to tell the spelling,"" she said.  ""Oh!"" exclaimed Jayanthi. ""Why?""  This caught Mrs. Varma off-guard. ""What do you mean why? That girl came first.""  Thinking of the sugar and milk, Jayanthi instantly placated. ""I see. First-aa?"" She widened her eyes and bobbled her head. ""What prize did she get? Certificate?""  ""Thu!"" Mrs. Varma spat. ""Certificate? What is this? Some local corporation school?""  ""Then?""  ""She got you know how much?""  ""How much?""  ""Ten thousand dollars!"" Mrs. Varma leaned back, and caught herself on one of the coconut trees, an expression of omnipotence radiating from her round face. She looked casually around. ""She could buy off your little flat if she wanted.""  Jayanthi smiled and grabbed her bucket. She was going to show this ghee-magnet a little thing or two about coming first. She was going to rouse her son at the crack of dawn, pour a cup of milk down his gullet, and make him cram studies until the school bus came at 9. She was going to take him hot lunch at school and spoon feed him, making sure that the lad didn't waste time with eating and instead focused on his studies. She was going to wait for him in the evening with tiffin, and after giving him a few minutes to change, make sure that he was done with his homework before he worked on his IIT preps. Yes, he was only in his third standard, but it was never too early to start. And one day when her son comes first, and his tiny passport-sized photo was plastered all over the newspapers, she would have her revenge.   Then, maybe, she would consider borrowing milk and sugar from this talking ladoo."

ABCDesis,37bmsd,CantankerousCaveBear,2,Wed May 27 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"Well, it's never too late to start. Surprisingly, I have the same arc as yours. I tried karate as a kid, but was scared by the teacher who kept caning students. While pursuing my MS I dabbled in muay thai for a while, and quite liked it. Only a year and a half ago did I stumble up on capoeira. I'm 33 now, and if I can do it, so can you!  With regards to the arts, you need to find your element. Writing is easy to begin, requires minimal equipment, but is tedious. Photograph is expensive to begin, easy to persist, but requires you to leave your comfort zone every time. I dabble in both, and that's why I can speak with authority on these two art forms.  If you choose to write, just start writing. There are no rules or schools to subscribe to. Write what comes naturally to you. Write small stories at first (or non-fiction if that's your thing). I, too, tend to be verbose, but I have learnt the art of editing. Writing is easy. Editing is tough. It's the same with photography. It's easy to click, but it's the post processing that sets your pictures apart.  I also am one of the moderators of /r/indianwriters Come over there, and post any queries you may have, or request feedback on what you've written. It's a quiet community, but there are some good writers in there.  Whatever you choose, now is the time! Don't procrastinate. The internet has made learning any new skill a breeze. It's easier than ever to start something you have no idea of and figure your way out if you are persistent."

ABCDesis,37bmsd,anand_pandey,11,Tue May 26 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I think we certainly can. I think the reason South Asians are underrepresented in those fields is probably due to a combination of the perception that sports and arts are more subjective to compete in, and are considered less important in the community. For instance, if your studying skills are already being honed, it's easier to transfer that to studying the dictionary. Furthermore as the article noted, you either know the word or you don't - so the playing field is more of a meritocracy than subjective disciplines like sports or the humanities, where your success can be determined by someone else's appraisal."
ABCDesis,37bmsd,frackaracka,8,Tue May 26 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"Good points.  In the sports and arts, many areas have their top performers peak early. South Asians aren't averse to spending all consuming years to perfect skills, they want to be able to use them later on. For example the average NFL player retires at 30. Dancers face much the same problem.  Anything where physicality is a huge factor tends toward an early end.  Sports and arts are very much a ""few winners get the overwhelming majority of the spoils"" phenomenon while most people struggle to make a living.  With the spelling bee, it's maybe a year of your life, and if you win you can carry it the rest of your life. If nothing, you can use your skills for as long as you can write anything."
ABCDesis,37bmsd,RotiRoll,5,Tue May 26 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"Precisely. There's also the cultural bias - sound engineering is a perfectly viable profession, for example, but we don't often see South Asian parents encouraging their kids to pursue music or studies that would lead down to that path. Unless it's South Asian music, and even then it's still just a hobby.  When I was a kid I was involved in tennis, swimming, gymnastics, ice skating, piano, and clarinet lessons. It's no coincidence that the only activity I continued to pursue was Bharatanatyam, lol."

I say this as a former student athlete (last season ended) and fan of fitness who also won some spelling bees in middle school. The spelling bee itself is kind of arbitrary, but educational competitions like Olympiads and debate gave me a lot more value in the longrun than playing games. A lot of my Punjabi friends are star athletes and praised for such, but I've never understood American and Punjabi culture's fascination with sports.   The favorite physical activity I do is Bhangra...but it's not considered an ""art"" by many, and I did it for my own fun."
ABCDesis,37bmsd,asdfioho,6,Tue May 26 17:05:24 2015 UTC,The fact that you don't personally see any long term value in sports doesn't mean that there isn't any. There are loads of life skills that you learn out of sports that solitary academic achievement can never teach you. The arts have their own set of unique skills as well.

I learned much of the same things from crew and basketball better via my Bhangra and debate team, including teamwork, discipline, having to lower yourself before a coach, having a team rely on you, competitiveness, motivation, plain grit, and the list goes on. To paint academic teams and the like as ""solitary academic achievement,"" is disingenous. Of course you need involvement outside the classroom. The insistence that it must be through physical games is reductive and shows ignorance of academic-oriented ""teams"" (note that I said the spelling bee doesn't count per say and is pretty damn superficial).

South Asians tend to circulate in the upper strata of American society, where there is an emphasis on physical fitness, more so than in India. In my experience South Asian Americans tend to be physically more fit than their Indian-born and raised counterparts."
ABCDesis,37bmsd,frackaracka,2,Tue May 26 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"Let me attempt to explain this to you from my 1st generation immigrant perspective:  USA since the past many decades largely admits indians either through STEM Student visas of STEM work visa. Unlike other countries fewer indians come on family sponsored visas (due to decades long waiting times) and diversity visa is not allowed. So while other contries send a heterogenous group of peoples with diverse lifestyles, india ends up sending a very homogenous intellectually superior group.  In india's vast population base to be good enough to be selected for those STEM visas by an american university/company, those indians would have to rise above and beyond the other teeming millions. How do they achieve it? They do so by slogging for hours in order to get excellent grades, publish excellent journal papers, or finish projects in short duration with excellent outputs. Also give GRE exams, be succcessful enough to secure loans or win scholarships and half a dozen other things.  In a low resource, highly competitive society like india, to rise to such levels would mean slogging on an average 10-12 hours a day. So only nerds and the academically/professionally obsessed win a ticket to live their lives in US and settle down, have kids etc.  Now think of the life of a happy go lucky kid in india, who likes to do his 8 hrs of work/study followed by a few hours of sports such as cricket, soccer or go to movies or do dating. Or think of s sportsman in India who slogged 5-10 hours playing sports. These people find it extremely hard to reach those levels of success to be shortlisted for the american dream and they never reach american shores. Living a normal life is just not good enough to enter the halls of success in india's dog eat dog society.  99% american kids born to indian parents have similar origins and this explains their professional, economic, social tendencies.  American immigration policy is literally (unintentionally) doing selective gene pooling from different nations. Similar trend exists for chinese americans."
ABCDesis,37bmsd,batsy71,3,Tue May 26 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're making the mistake of conflating the physicality of American-born kids versus their parents.  Many American kids enjoy similar happy-go-lucky lives as that kid in India. Our parents' sacrifice ensured that we can. What you will rarely see are those kids channeling those interests into long-term careers, which was pointed out by other comments on this thread. Sports/arts are not exactly viable fields for long-term careers, regardless of any ethnic group's ""intrinsic"" abilities.   I think we agree that the imported culture of highly-educated immigrants informs their children's professional and economic tendencies. What I'm trying to point out is that there are other reasons besides physicality that prevent or discourage American Desis from pursuing excellence in those fields in large numbers."

ABCDesis,37bmsd,frackaracka,3,Tue May 26 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I disagree, but our experiences may differ depending on where you're located. I could see there being more obese Indian-Americans in certain parts of the country.  For instance, when I use dating apps I can instantly tell the difference with guys in my area. Just going off of physicality, dress, and stature, I can tell which guys are recent immigrants and which are Americans. Neither group is particularly fashion-forward, but the Americans are head and shoulders above the immigrants, and the way they carry themselves - even in pictures - is significantly different. That last part is the biggest difference, in my opinion, because the way you dress and the way you carry yourself contribute immensely to the overall perception of your physicality.  That's not a knock on immigrants, they have bigger things to worry about than how they come across in pictures, lol. But there's an obvious difference."

ABCDesis,37bmsd,batsy71,2,Tue May 26 18:02:54 2015 UTC,Dude. Chill. Indian american kids are not weak. Read my answer properly. I am saying the first generation immigrants are largely nerds (i.e. mentally sharp) but weak ( i.e. never bothered about physical fitness or invested much time and effort into it) This mentality leads to the immigrants mostly encouraging their kids to keep stressing on acads and not sports. The indian kids born and raised in US are obviously healthier than their parents as they get much healthier nutrition and environment.  This argument can be further extended to the african americans and their domination in sports as there is an explanation that the ancestors of african americans were those who survived starvation and disease while being shipped from African to america and so their progeny is pretty hardy and healthy.

ABCDesis,377jtj,oinkyy,2,Tue May 26 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what sort of book you're looking for, but I highly recommend the book I'm currently reading- If it's Monday it Must be Madurai by Srinath Perur. Perur is a travel writer who becomes fascinated by those group, conducted tours that Desi people go on so often. During the course of the book Perur goes on several of these tours and acts as a silent observer, noting how the tourists interact with each other and the places around them and how the backdrop of a conducted tour affects the way they conduct themselves. I've not finished the book yet but it's been fantastic so far- I'm trying to read it as slow as possible to make it last longer."

ABCDesis,375yo8,ChitownNomzy,14,Mon May 25 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Back in highschool I was a short guy 5''5'( guess I still am). I was also quite chunky but I worked a lot at a fruit markets carrying things and I would play rugby so I had a lot of lower body strength. Three random guys from the local high school decided to start some shit whilst I was waiting to catch the bus to this nerd school I went to on scholarship. At first I thought it was money they were after (which I had none) but no, these guys were just looking for someone to harass. I started backing away from the bus shelter whilst these fellas hurled abuse. I tried to diffuse the situation by walking away but I heard footsteps so I turned around. One of the guys had tried to king hit me but I ducked his haymaker. I then grabbed him low and flipped him onto the road. His 2 mates were laughing behind him. I told him to stay down but he didnt. He got up and charged me again, I ducked and tackled him low down and then flipped him again. I screamed at him to stay down but he started to get up again. I mustered all my strength and punted him right in his temple. I was wearing these hard capped boots that I usually wore to the fruit markets as PPE and also to school. There was a massive crack sound and the guy went completely limp. His two mates just legged it. I was stunned and freaking out. Luckily a driver had seen all the commotion and quickly called for help. He then did CPR on the bully and got me to help him out with the compressions.  Anyway I ended up fracturing that dudes orbital socket. He lost his eye. He made a full recovery in hospital sans eye. I had to give a statement to the cops. The driver + video footage confirmed my side of events and the bully + his 2 mates were charged with a hate crime (as they were shouting racist things before attacking me) + assualt + lying to the police . The guys family tried their hardest to get me arrested but I ended up avoiding charges due to self defense + the evidence + my age (15) versus theirs (18). They then threatened a civil suit but they dropped it later on. It was a whole mess."

ABCDesis,375yo8,TaazaPlaza,11,Mon May 25 15:30:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, definitely most (can't say all just because but all the Punjabis I know do not like him). During independence day, most Punjabis post about how they hate him/it was really Bhagat Singh who gained independence, etc.. I don't agree with all their sentiments and I don't really hate Gandhi, but I can't say I am an advocate of Gandhian philosophy as I think it is to an extent too idealistic and not concerned with pragmatism.  One has to realize that   A) extreme pacifism is simply not a Sikh principle, we believe in peace but when being oppressed, with no other options, for a rightful cause, and in self-defense, we can draw the sword,   B) Desi cultures are NOT a bloc, Punjabi culture does not adhere to ahimsa and is certainly not peaceful--it is much more violent than Sikhi ever permits. Most Punjabi rural folk heroes were violent in some way. Even among the love stories of Punjab, Mirza is the most popular for his daring and fighting Sahiba's brothers.  C) Even back then, the majority of revolutionaries from Punjab, from Madan Lal Dhingra, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Udham Singh, Bhagat Singh, and much more, were violent (the majority of violent revolutionaries also happened to be Punjabi, so that statistic applies switched around as well). The only peaceful ones that come to mind were intellectuals like Lala Lajpat Rai (and even they had some violent end that lionized them as a martyr), and religious groups like the Kukas who were advocates of extreme pacifism far before Gandhi and were executed on British cannons."
ABCDesis,375yo8,asdfioho,5,Mon May 25 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"During independence day, most Punjabis post about how they hate him/it was really Bhagat Singh who gained independence, etc.   Hmm, I've seen similar sentiments amongst many here in Chennai. Not hate or vehemence, but generally how pacifism was us surrendering to the Brits.   A)    Good point.   B) Desi cultures are NOT a bloc   Goes without saying. I'm a big proponent of that awareness. Sadly there's heavy stereotyping in every cultural region of South Asia.  As for the rest of the point, I don't think any of us are big on ahimsa but I can say that in TN the general public is very non confrontational. And in general I've noticed South Indian mass culture is relatively less confrontational compared to Punjab/Hindi belt.  For some reason, your comment made me assume that it was a specific Punjabi diaspora thing based on some bad blood."
ABCDesis,375yo8,Canuckistan95,2,Mon May 25 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, perhaps. Although I do think it's interesting to note that Punjabi culture actually doesn't condone killing unless in extreme cases; the violence is more of fighting, sword-buckling, etc.. Confrontational for sure but not always down to take a life."

That was very confusing to read, infanct this whole exchange was. I think you meant to say current day Indian Punjabis don't know about Jinnah... Also every time you talk about ""most Punjabis""or ""Punjabi culture"" I instinctively think of West Punjab considering that is most of Punjab."
ABCDesis,375yo8,ChachaKirket,3,Tue May 26 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"It was pretty poorly written and I was pretty much talking about those from the East (mostly Sikhs), my perception is that Western Punjabis generally do have a positive connotation of Jinnah but among Eastern Punjabis, he's not really well known. contemporary Akali politicians at the time like Master Tara Singh were not a fan of him, but that may have changed due to the Sikh community's experience with India during 1984. What do Western Punjabis think of Gandhi?  And you're absolutely right, the majority of Punjab is in Pakistan. I'm referring mostly to Sikhs considering my experience is that Muslim Punjabis predominantly identify as Pakistani, Hindu Punjabis as Indian, and Sikh Punjabis as Punjabi, so it's just something caught up in my mind I suppose."
ABCDesis,375yo8,asdfioho,2,Tue May 26 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"He's viewed as a generally good man, an amicable contemporary to Jinnah even after their paths diverged. There are obvious variations in peoples personal view of him, some really admire him being a man of principle and others blame him for increasingly bringing his religious leanings into politics.   If Pakistan didn't have such a myopic view of it's own history he would be largely celebrated because the man literally took a bullet by an Indian in his protest for Pakistans share of assets after partition.    I'm referring mostly to Sikhs considering my experience is that Muslim Punjabis predominantly identify as Pakistani, Hindu Punjabis as Indian, and Sikh Punjabis as Punjabi, so it's just something caught up in my mind I suppose.   As for this part, those are two different questions. Nationality and ethnicity are two different things, your anecdote mainly illustrates the dissatisfaction diasporic Sikhs have with the Indian state. Kind of goes back the whole Master Tara Singh/Jinnah thing considering that Sikhs had the hopes of creating an autonomous homeland so I just see that attitude as a lingering remnant of that struggle. Although I get the impression that Sikhs in India have mostly come to terms with being part of centralized India.   And sorry to say but people can blame Gandhi or Jinnah all they want but it was the rich land owning Sikhs that split up Punjab and most of them from the West ended up switching places with the landless Muslim peasantry of the East."
ABCDesis,375yo8,dagp89,2,Wed May 27 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.   your anecdote mainly illustrates the dissatisfaction diasporic Sikhs have with the Indian state   Actually goes back a bit further to when the various religious right wing groups in Punjab all had to ""pick a language."" Hindu nationalists picked Hindi, Muslim nationalists supported Urdu, and Sikh nationalists under the Akalis picked Punjabi and heavily supported Punjabi literature. Not to mention Ranjit Singh's rule is the origin of Punjabiyat, a concept championed more heavily by Akali Sikhs. So that linguistic/ethnic relationship is pre-partition.   Although I get the impression that Sikhs in India have mostly come to terms with being part of centralized India.    most are, and I am as well.   And sorry to say but people can blame Gandhi or Jinnah all they want but it was the rich land owning Sikhs that split up Punjab and most of them from the West ended up switching places with the landless Muslim peasantry of the East.    oh yeah, when people say crap like ""Gandhi ripped my parents from their home,"" I just cringe at the false history. It was Tara Singh and the Sikhs that requested a split of the Punjab, and they were mainly granted so because they had a political influence as a result of all the weapons and arms training they amassed and would threaten to use. People also need to realize that Sikhs in the West were pretty much Zamindars over landless Muslims, and that they were not a majority in that area so the Sikhs definitely were not entitled to the land or that part of Punjab that is now Pakistan. However, the history is a bit more complex. I don't personally blame Jinnah or Gandhi at all, but other factors in the Muslim League played a big part in alienating Sikhs from unified Punjab. The Unionist Party under Sikander Hayat Khan and Jinnah alike made promises to and ensured Sikhs that even as a minority they would be ensured equal protection in Pakistan, but that really wasn't the case. See the Jhatka meat act. Sikhs wanted there to be an assurance that both Jhatka and halal meat would be served in government institutions, and the Jhatka meat act was passed accordingly by Hayat Khan. However, the Muslim majority spurred by the Muslim League wanted to ban all Jhatka in the entire of Punjab. Not to mention during land disputes for Gurdwaras, land was favored for mosques to appease the Muslim majority. I believe unified Punjab had the potential for peace in its past, and is close to it one day, but there's no way it would have happened after all the right wing movements in the early 20th century popped up with each simply trying to secure a part of their pie.  Also, while the majority of Western Punjabi Muslims were poor and worked under rich rural Sardar land owners or rich Hindu merchants (another factor that explains Partition violence in general), Eastern Punjabi Muslims concentrated in the Gurdaspur/Sirhind areas were well off. My fathers current village near Sirhind/Patiala is a formerly Muslim one, and the Muslims owned and tilled their own land unlike the feudal relationship found in the West."

ABCDesis,375yo8,mcat36,2,Mon Jun 1 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"Even if she was corrupt their motives for killing her was pure vengeance for operation blue star, Dont try and justify what they did   Why? She wasn't just ""corrupt"": lists of her offenses include vote-stuffing in Kashmir that specifically was to dissolve special regional privileges Kashmir was understood to have when they joined India, instating a violent regime in Kashmir that killed civilians and protestors, alienated average Kashmiris, and bred a militancy. Regarding Blue Star, yes, there's no doubt that they were spurred on by Blue Star. Just like how Udham Singh wasn't necessarily concerned with ""foreign occupation"" and British imperialism until he witnessed those imperialists kill many of his own. I hope you realize that the most damaging aspect of Blue Star was the civilian deaths caused at army hands, in big part because of the asinine (and perhaps deliberate) decision to attack on a religious holiday. I, like many Sikhs, have no problem with the Indian government taking fighting and killing off militants; it's the state's job. But when you kill civilians, capture and torture civilians, arrest Akalis across the state in a political gamble, it crosses that line.  Who are you to tell us what to think? Was your grandfather put in jail during Bluestar for his political affiliation? Was your community's treasured manuscripts and library burnt to the ground or taken by Indian security forces? Was your community played around with like a toy by the central government and then bulldozed when it was convenient to do so? I would say it is you that should heed your own advice ""Dont justify what she did.""   Also please Dont throw around words like ""dictator"", she might have been a lot of things but not a dictator.   So what do you make of the multiple Constitutional amendments that passed in her time to expand central power? Or the fact that, I dunno, she illegitimately declared a state of emergency to get at her political opponents?   And Udham Singh was right in what he did because he was opposing a foreign occupier.   Ah, the irony. When it's Sikhs/Punjabis looking at Indira Gandhi's death, there's obviously some systematic problem with violence and terrorist tendencies. Yet when Udham Singh is concerned, he's lauded into a nationalist hero because he killed a white man. To many, a non-Punjabi Indira Gandhi sitting in Delhi may seem like a foreign occupier as well, with the way she tried to spread the branches of the center and undermine regional autonomy promised by Jawarlal Nehru at Partition.   the irony is that they were supposed to protect her   Yeah, this, I'll admit is off. Then again, she also had a duty as a PM to mete out equal treatment to her citizens, which she failed to do."

ABCDesis,374nsv,GWmyc2,5,Sun May 24 23:52:23 2015 UTC,"The Urdu phrase “bus bohot hogiya hay” sends chills down Umair Khan’s spine.  Roughly translated as “enough already,” it’s something Mr. Khan, 34, a Manhattan lawyer, has heard uttered by his mother, his aunt and their Pakistani-American friends on several occasions, lately with increasing exasperation. The frustration stems from Mr. Khan’s inability to find a suitable mate.  Like many second-generation South Asian-Americans, Mr. Khan finds himself walking a fine line between paying respect to traditional matchmaking practices extolled by an older generation and embracing more contemporary methods of finding an appropriate life partner.  His search has involved, among other things, being fixed up by professional “Rishta aunties” hired by his mother, meeting women at networking events and suggestions he try online dating.  “It’s exhausting,” said Mr. Khan, deputy counsel for litigation in the New York Public Advocate’s office. “When you’re set up, there’s another dimension to that meeting. You’ve got to give a report when it’s over. That’s the tricky part. How do you tell the referring authority you’re not interested without offending them?”  Within many immigrant communities, more attention seems to focus on marrying off daughters, but it is often the sons who bear the weight of family expectations when it comes to picking a mate.  Overt pressure may be lessening, and outright arranged marriages are the exception rather than the rule, but the love lives of those whose families are from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh may nevertheless be subject to a good deal of scrutiny and occasional intervention. And the men themselves are becoming more demanding."

Problems also arise when the expectations of the parents don’t match the preferences of their sons, according to Ms. Qadir, who said that more than half her client base is made up of the parents rather than the offspring.

I knew nothing about it.”  Though he didn’t spend much time with his new bride, a dental student who is also just 20, Mr. Darji is hoping things will work out when she joins him in the United States next year, since, as he pointed out, he doesn’t have much choice in the matter.  “It’s either the girl or the parents,” he said. “If I were to bring home my own girl, I’d lose my family.”  On the other hand, Ashwin Mathur, 21, of Great Falls, Va., said that his parents had been very relaxed about the dating choices he and his siblings have made. “They say, ‘You guys are American, you do what you want,’ ” said Mr. Mathur, a junior at New York University whose parents were acquainted before being formally united in India more than 30 years ago. In choosing a mate, Mr. Mathur said he’s looking for someone both he and his family like.  As it happens, Mr. Mathur is now dating an Indian woman from London who is also studying at N.Y.U. “It’s easier to get along with a girl of Indian descent,” he said. “It’s like, ‘I get you and you get me.’ There’s a comfort level.”  Among the earlier generation of South Asian immigrants coming to the United States, the drive to succeed, in many cases, trumped the drive to marry.  Omar Qureshi came to the United States from Pakistan after President Lyndon B. Johnson loosened immigration policies for students and young professionals in the 1960s.  Mr. Qureshi, a history teacher at the Brearley School in Manhattan, said he felt little marital pressure from his parents, who were more concerned that he secure a good education. “We used to joke that our mother was completely incompetent when it came to marrying her sons off,” said Mr. Qureshi, who remains single at 49, while his two younger brothers are both married.  Though he may not have felt pressure from his family to marry within his culture or religion, Mr. Qureshi, like Mr. Mathur, has internalized his own expectations.  “I find Pakistani women incredibly attractive, but I don’t really meet any,” Mr. Qureshi said. “Most of my friends are American, but I never thought of marrying someone who wasn’t Pakistani.”  Mr. Qureshi’s odds are about to change in his favor. This summer, he will leave New York and move to Pakistan to teach at a university there. Though he said meeting a woman was not a primary motivation for his move, he acknowledged “if I find someone, that would be great.”"
ABCDesis,374nsv,KaliYugaz,6,Mon May 25 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"Jamila Akhter, a mother of three grown children, has noticed that the family influence has lessened among her friends, as fewer second-generation South Asian couples are living in their parents’ homes in her community in North Brunswick, N.J.  “Traditionally, it was not about two individuals, but about two families coming together,” Ms. Akhter said. “For some families, when they first came to this country, the parents might be stricter with their oldest kids. So some of those kids didn’t get married, or got divorced, or ended up in unhappy marriages. Then the parents ended up being more lenient with the younger kids.”  That said, she couldn’t resist offering to help her son, Assad, after he reached 30 and still hadn’t settled down. She asked friends to refer possible candidates and ended up hiring a traditional Rishta auntie. In the end, her son found his future wife through a professional networking event. And how helpful was the Rishta auntie?  “Not so much,” Ms. Akhter said. “She criticized my son a lot. She’d say: ‘What is he looking for? That was such a nice girl I introduced him to.’ ”  Beyond the busybody neighborhood “auntie,” the job of professional matchmaker has become big business.  Jasbina Ahluwalia, a lawyer turned matchmaker, puts a contemporary twist on an old practice, offering online dating support, dating coaching and customized mate searches for South Asians in the United States and abroad. She charges $375 for a 90-minute personal assessment, about $4,000 for online support and $8,500 to $50,000 for matchmaking, she said.  Ms. Ahluwalia, a second-generation Indian-American, says working with today’s South Asian-American men is difficult at times. “They are so successful, and tend to be very busy,” she said. “The challenge is getting them to make time. I tell them, ‘We can find you great women, but we can’t have the relationship for you.’ ”  As with many demographic subsets, there are numerous online mating sites geared to the South Asian and Muslim communities, including salaamlove.com, singlemuslim.com and the India-based shaadi.com, which calls itself “the world’s largest matrimonial service” and claims 3.2 million successful pairings.  While embracing contemporary technology, these sites also pay homage to traditional customs. On singlemuslim.com, in addition to a vast database of participants’ profiles and photos, there is advice, with recommendations like: “Praise your wife when she pleases you and show gratitude for all she does for you.”  Though it’s been suggested by many friends, Mr. Khan has yet to turn to online dating. If he were to create a profile, he said, his headline would read something close to this: “Part Tandoori Chicken, Part Apple Pie.”  “It’s not an easy space to be in,” Mr. Khan said, “when you’re trying to bring in culture, and faith. To find someone with strong beliefs and good values, but also someone who gets it, and is smart. Maybe the checklist is too long.”"

ABCDesis,36xrm3,anirvan,5,Sat May 23 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"USC professor Nayan Shah researches race, sexuality, and Asian America. In his papers, and in his book Stranger Intimacy: Contesting Race, Sexuality and the Law in the North American West, he explores the stories of early Sikh immigrants who found themselves caught on the wrong side of the law because their sexuality defied norms.  In February 1918, ranch hand Jamil Singh was arrested for having sex with a younger white man in Sacramento, California. In court, Singh described how he was a good man, sending money back to his wife, widowed mother, and son back in India, and avoided gambling and drugs, but the judge eventually sentenced him to seven years imprisonment at San Quentin State Prison.  Shah uses this story to explore larger issues around the intersection of policing, race, and sexuality, but for me, I'm just amazed that we have records of Indian American MSM (men who had sex with men) 97 years ago, ""thanks"" to the homophobic police who arrested him.  The story of Jamil Singh definitely makes me wonder: what other queer histories are we missing in the margins of Desi American history?"
ABCDesis,36xrm3,Singh101,1 point,Sat May 23 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"I doubt that they were actually homosexuals.

You cannot equate race with caste. Racial preferences are there because it's okay to prefer to date someone from your own background or culture. Some people connect with others who have gone through similar experiences. But caste shouldn't represent one's culture at all. The caste system was abolished for a reason. We need to erase these imaginary boundaries and unite together as Hindus first.

We need to erase these imaginary boundaries and unite together as Hindus first.    No one abolished castes. What was abolished is untouchability and rightly so. And the boundaries are not as imaginary as you seem to think they are. Copy pasting from my other comment  ""Caste has it's uses but ultimately I believe that the negatives outweigh the positives. If the point was simply that ""Don't use caste even if it is useful because removing caste does a lot of good"" then I would support that.

If anything, caste represents culture much more closely than race. A White Nordic-origin person from Minnesota has very little in common with an old Southern family, which is not the case for Dalits from Tamil Nadu and Kerala (neighbouring Indian states). People of the same caste from different states generally don't marry each other either.  I am not saying that having a preference like caste should be acceptable in modern society but it's no worse than race or ethnicity, just because White Americans happen to do the latter."

Arranged marriages that are specifically caste/creed based are quite the norm in India. To say they are equivalent is highly inaccurate.  That said, most couples in this country date/marry people of the same race/color (and often same religious/church group). At the end of the day, it's personal preference.   It's how some people say they like lighter skin. You can disagree with their thinking, but they do have the freedom to have their own preferences/attitudes to those things."
ABCDesis,36udkx,badmintonnewbie,-1,Fri May 22 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"So that analogy was meant to show how ridiculous ""personal preferences"" are. Both whites and Iyers are privileged groups in society, and prefer to be with their kind, which happens every day and it's a fact of life. But to publicly declare your preference is another matter because it's harmful and violent towards minorities. It makes it okay for privileged groups to find acceptance with their discriminatory preferences when it comes to dating, allowing it to extend into other areas of the public sphere. By making it shameful to publicly announce your shitty preferences, it will discourage discrimination and prejudice against lower caste people overall.    I'm sorry I cannot get on board with equating caste preferences to cultural preferences. To a certain extent, caste does come with a sub-culture, but the differences are so minor, and do more harm in dividing us rather than celebrating our Hindu-ness.  I agree with you though, people can do whatever they want, but of course I can disagree with it. I will also be side-eyeing and shaking my head."

ABCDesis,36udkx,DragonFireTongue,1 point,Sun May 24 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"They follow their own code/rules/practices.    Maybe I am being ignorant here, but I didn't know my ""Iyer"" friend has any different code/rules/practices when we visit the temples here. Is this some sort of a thing applicable only in India?  Care to explain?   An Iyer desiring to find an Iyer partner has no automatic implication that Iyers are superior to everyone else.    The implication exists because Iyer is a Hindu Brahmin caste and caste system has been considered the largest social evil in Indian society. Hence when it comes to preference for Iyer marriages, it has a connotation of consolidation of power and wealth within the Brahmin community at expense of the Dalits.   Anyways seriously though, I  am glad the LGBT rights are making inroads into the society albeit at expense of perpetuating the caste system. It is kind of similar to how same sex marriage in the US has benefited mostly white gay people while leaving LGBT people of color behind in terms of being accepted as equal in the society."
ABCDesis,36udkx,coldcoldnovemberrain,4,Fri May 22 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"How would you explain people from backward castes preferring partners from their own caste? Based on what you have said everyone should be open to marrying anyone from castes higher than their own in the social hierarchy. But you don't see that in practice.  To your question about how Iyers may be different, I have an anecdote myself. One of my cousins married a brahmin and they don't eat non-veg, garlic(imagine that, no garlic in your food) and have different religious practices. That being said she is happy now. So I think that decision turned out to be the right one. But can I say everyone is like my cousin? Absolutely not. Who am I to judge what makes(or should make) people happy."

I am sure with gender imbalance in India, they will end up being flexible on this issue.   You have to keep the context of caste system and its impact on the Indian society and the history of violence and subjagation. No one is forcing people to marry inter-caste.  When someone advertises their marriage proposal and restricts it to their own caste it comes across as bigotry.  You point out dietary restrictions.

If what you are saying is true then everyone who is on the same level must be ok with inter marriage but that's not the case. I actually put this question to my parents(Would you be ok if I were to say marry a brahmin?). My mother's response - ""Hell no, Brahmins are <insert her stereotype>. Why would you want to marry them?"" Go to matrimonial websites and see what non-brahmin profiles say. A vast majority of them indicate a preference for their own caste.     You point out dietary restrictions. If that is so then advertise looking for vegetarian partner or something like that.    My point was that there are differences and they don't stop at dietary restrictions. Instead of filling your advertisements with ""Want someone who doesn't eat garlic, onions and who bathes before cooking, is ok with doing Sandhya Vandanams and observes maila yadda yadda"" you simply write Brahmins preferred.  Edit: Caste has it's uses but ultimately I believe that the negatives outweigh the positives. If the point was simply that ""don't use caste even if it is useful because removing caste does a lot of good"" then I would support that.

I'm talking, when even asking ""why"" is considered disrespectful.   EXAMPLE: My grandmother is having some unexplained leg pain. She goes to the doctor (in India) for this, who hears about her leg symptom and doesn't want to hear anything else. He's an authority figure, so she follows/respects him blindly, not asking him why he's giving her XYZ medication for the pain. Later, in our conversation, I learn she's taking a cox-2 inhibitor for the pain (like Celebrex), which increases the incidence of clots by A LOT. I freak, because she's had two angioplasties in the past so her vessels are somewhat of a concern for me. She's very against going back to the original doctor and asking him why he prescribed that/trying to tell him more about her patient history (because gasp! what if she offends him!) so she talks to her brother-in-law, who was a cardiologist, instead. He agrees with me that in her case, the pain medicine she's taking would have been contra-indicated, and switches her to something else.   Now, if she hadn't talked to me, what would have happened to her? I shudder to think. And just because she was too afraid of ""offending"" an authority figure. Humph."

Whether that came from respect, fear, or simply etiquette or disposition.   I agree about the coddling and cajoling though, especially for the boys, and the restrictions on the girls.

I just got back from lunch where a little girl screamed for an hour straight because the restaurant did not have watermelon juice.    I think kids our generation and earlier were less spoiled because there were more kids in each family, especially in joint families while at the same time there was limited money.  In India right now, I see mostly nuclear families with 1 kid and way more money thanks to the booming economy.  Kids as young as 5/6 carrying iphones and wearing brand name clothes is super common."

The difference in parenting styles is nothing short of remarkable.   In the 3k annum group, parents swat their kid immediately if they put a single toe out of line. Their kids are delightful and remarkably well-behaved. The parents still subscribing to the harsh love/parents-as-disciplinarians that was more common in my wife's generation. There's still that ""respect authority no matter what.""   As to my peer group, half of the kids in my circle are spoiled rotten. What's more is that well-educated, wealthy Indian parents are now subscribing to the Western lingo of things like, ""my child just has a few behavioral problems that I'm addressing with his counselor."" In my eyes, the issue is invariably the parent pandering far too much to the kid (handing over the iPad, doing nothing or downplaying the situation when the kid hits the parent, etc). I have no idea why so many of my friends tolerate such awful behavior from their kids.   And the kids+restaurant scene is abysmal. I don't know why parents think it's okay to let their children run everywhere and play with the decor. Some parents even let their kids stand on the table and show them like a centerpiece. Maybe they translate the experience of getting served in a restaurant equivalent to that of being at home with their cooks and nannies... but I've been appalled by the conduct of kids and the blase attitude of parents.

Western Pakistan is Pathan/Baloch majority and has a lot in common with Afghanistan, they're more Iranic. If you're going to consider South India a distinct entity from the rest of South Asia it makes no sense - Either you divide the entire region among similar lines, or look at it as a cultural spectrum of sorts.

Why not both? Ethnicities and nationalities my family has been mistaken for: Iranian Iraqi Saudi Mexican Italian (Sicilian)  Many Desis take pains to distinguish that they're Desis and not some other group. One we have our own identity and two: it's actually dangerous sometimes.  For example, my cousin was in college when 9/11 happened. Someone spit on her in the cafeteria and started screaming. They didn't particularly bother to find out who she was, they assumed.  And of course, my father and brother take pains to be clean shaven and kempt so they can get through screening at the airport easier (because apparently a 3'o clock shadow on their face is threatening somehow).  Most Americans and most white people do not have passports (and international travel is a fact of life for many of us.

I was reading that the FBI will start tracking hate crimes against Arabs, Hindus, and Sikhs, however, there were no Arabs to make this announcement. The announcer is a Sardarji!   Why are Sikhs and other non-Muslim Indian groups targeted? Because we are darker than Arabs, who are now the ""new-Italians.""   In the USA, the Hindus are fighting the battles for the Arabs.

Or different sub-ethnicities of black people (ex. sub-saharan blacks vs australian aboriginals).  And so what-- as long as it's ""honest ignorance"" and not malicious prejudice.    I bring this up because the Syrian guy and other Middle Easterners that I knew are never excluded, is never shamed because of the politics in his nation like I am, and is basically accorded ""honorary Whiteness.""   Consider them lucky then. Middle easterners are frequently shamed for the politics of their home country/region more than Indians in general.

Right after getting married, my parents lived in Chandigarh for a a year or two (I think) and had Haryanvi neighbors who were loud, disrespectful and overall annoying. A sane person would think ""oh, they're just annoying people"" but my mom thinks ""Haryanvis are annoying people"".  My ex was Chinese and she had all these assumptions about Chinese people, like ""don't they eat snakes?"" but she was still cool when my ex came over for lunch when my parents were here.

They now live in a pretty Desi-dominated area, but I think these experiences really contributed to my parents being pretty open-minded and accepting of all kinds of people.

In person, we have Indian friends, he has Indian employees, and he treats them the same as anyone else. I feel like comments he makes are joking, but rooted in something deeper.  His side of the extended family though...like I said, my mom must have a strong influence on my dad. Last time his side of the family was together, my uncles started a long rant about 'the Jews.'

ABCDesis,36rqmu,bug-bear,7,Thu May 21 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"As evidenced by my own experience, my parents take refuge in the following mind-fuckery to justify their inconsistencies in judgement and behavior: people from other walks of life are lovely to know and have as friends [i.e. see we are reasonable, normal, and accepting], but don't bother asking if we'd accept you to marry our daughter because that's fucking crazy talk [e.g. Non-indians will divorce you, make you abandon your cultural group, and leave you penniless].   It's quite sad, and very confusing to watch them do this. My mom has grown to be more self-aware of how she thinks/speaks of other groups, and considerably much more accepting over time.

ABCDesis,36rqmu,ComeAtMeBrosephine,7,Thu May 21 17:05:28 2015 UTC,It's due to a problem where Indians grew up never learning their history. We have little to be proud of because we don't learn history and learn why things worked out the way they did.  So we embellish fake achievement while ignoring real ones.  Ever seen old Indian weapons? The colour is from a high carbon steel. Until the industrial revolution produced cheap blades from Europe most Indian weapons were made of this lost steel of exceptional quality but hard to work. The pattern on the blades van never be achieved today but the closest we get is Damascus steel.  Mentions in Indian history books? Nil. That's why people make stuff up about it. History is seen as boring. We don't learn the tactics of the Maurya or sailing strategy of the Chola. Instead you read about Alexander and we want that romance.  So we make stuff up.

Actually, most of the time our family hangs out just by ourselves, holidays are spent with close relatives, and some weekend get-togethers on occasion with the Hindu-desi friends I mentioned.   Wondering if this not ideal upbringing for my son and daughter (both young). My wife and I have been in the US now for almost 2+ decades, we are fair bit assimilated, both have thrived in careers/work life that's atypical for desis, live in an area with almost no desis. My son goes to school that has no desis of any kind, so all of his birthday parties, sleepovers, play dates, friendships are all non-desi. His desi friends are sons/daughters of my Hindu-desi friends, who he hangs out with on occasional weekend playdates. My daughter is too young for all of this.   What do you think of this?

Taj Mahal, Red Label, Yellow Label, and even Wagh Bakri are identical teas sourced from the exact tea gardens and fermented the same ways. Through the magic of branding, we seem to believe that there are differences in them.  I add my sugar (or if available honey) after the tea is in the cup. It requires MUCH less sugar because (1) the sugar becomes slightly caramelized if you boil it, and also (2) you're not losing any of the sugar in the filtration process. Duh.  I use fresh ginger. It doesn't matter if you skin the ginger or not, but as a matter of convention, I skin the ginger.  The ginger chai gets more spicy towards the bottom of the cup, probably because the ginger flavorings are dense. I use whole milk in a 1:3 ratio with water. So if I made 8 oz. of chai, there would be 6 oz. of water and 2 oz. of whole milk."

I once read an article that Wagh Bakri actually attempts to tailor its tea power to the particular region they are selling, e.g. certain parts prefer stronger tea so they will dry the leaves in a certain way. People in another part may prefer a milkier tea, and so they will make sure the type of tea powder they sell in that area will help create a smooth milky tea."

Another words, the Colgate toothpaste in Cali is identical to the one in Maine.

ABCDesis,36pny9,awesomeplans,6,Sun May 24 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"Chai is a spiced milk drink, whose flavourings include tea.  Actual tea is tea leaves, boiling water, and not more than 10% milk. There are cultures were any milk stops it being called tea.  That is my definition of 'real' tea. Your whinging and whining about chai meaning tea in Indian languages doesn't help (considering that it comes from the Mandarin cha, which mean tea as I defined it), and how much tea is used per serving doesn't matter either when it is crowded out by the flavours of cardamom, cinnamon, pepper and all the other spices. Their congregation creates a new flavour, with hints of them all, the flavour of masala chai.  The only reason masala chai even exists is precisely because Indian drinkers did not like the taste of tea in isolation. When British merchants tried to sell it to them they had to alter the way it was prepared and used it as one of many flavourings for it to become accepted as a flavour.  That is why I call Masala Chai 'not real tea'.  I say this as a lover of tea, and chai tea. I have a collection of tea that would make your eyes water with a selection from all over the world. I have imported masala chai from all over India at great expense and enjoy the regional differences, and smile at the endearing Hinglish packaging. I have a Russian tea urn, a morrocan silver tea pot, and a traditional Japanese set. Tea with gingseng, tea with ginger, tea with raspberry leaf, tea with jasmine flowers and tea with mint. Gunpowder tea, white tea, black tea, yellow tea, green tea, even a box of roobios tea I've never wanted more than a glass of.  I love everything tea touches.  That doesn't make masala chai tea. It is a spiced milk drink.  That is my definition, and the definition I think the majority of the world would agree with. If you disagree that's fine by me but you cannot impose your view upon me."

ABCDesis,36nqib,Anandya,3,Wed May 20 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"Nice pictures, man. I could critique your pictures if you'd like."
ABCDesis,36nqib,SabashChandraBose,3,Thu May 21 12:57:49 2015 UTC,Go for it! I always appreciate feedback. I used to shoot a lot as a kid. Took a huge break and now picked it up again.
ABCDesis,36nqib,SabashChandraBose,2,Thu May 21 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"Photography is one of my serious hobbies, and over time I have learnt a few things on my own:  1) Shoot a lot. It's an art form. The more you practice the better you'll get.  2) Learn to edit. Shooting is half the battle. Editing is the rest. Photoshop or GIMP, you'll have to learn to fix contrast, crop, levels, dodging/burning, etc. Pretty much every picture needs work.  3) Learn to frame. One of the issues I see with your pictures is that your framing is not aesthetic. There is a lot of clutter. One way to overcome this is to use a good lens that'll let you add depth of field (bokeh). If that's not feasible you have to learn to get closer to your subjects and frame them just right. There are a few rules out there: rule of thirds, golden ratio, etc. Read up on them, and begin to apply them even if it's using your smartphone camera. Here is a picture of mine from Chor Bazar in Bombay. (Sorry for using my own pic as an example, but I can ignore copyright issues!) When I shot this as it was, it was not...pleasing. I ended up making a very tight crop, and then filling the space (artificially) with the sky. Luckily for me the sky was monochromatic and Photoshop can do magic. But my point here is that a direct center frame would not (and did not) have created a nice composition.  4) Learn to let go. When you just start shooting, every picture is a work of art. According to you. When you revisit them many years later, and if you've still been shooting, you'll start discarding many pictures as average. As you shoot you'll develop this keen eye too. So you'll start to discard pictures as average much more rapidly. Essentially, you would have raised your bar for a good picture. This is the first thing I see in your selection: you have way too many pictures of the same subject. This dilutes the subject. Why see one photo of a biker when there is another one?  5) Ask for feedback from people close and far to you. When I started only friends and family gave me feedback (this was before internet was really a tool). This reinforced my delusion that I was an amazing photog! Later when I joined flickr groups did I realize how average my photos were, and once I had swallowed my ego, I asked and I received. Critiques came in and I digested all of them.  6) Emulate other works. Find a photog you like and try to emulate his/her work. Over time I learnt that I wasn't a landscape guy or a macro guy. Street is where my heart was at and I now I follow a dozen street photographers on G+ and flickr. Their work keeps me constantly thinking. You have to yet find out what type of photographer you are. Until then your energies will not be focused. Experiment, and you'll know.  My favorite among all the pictures is the one with the old lady (black-and-white). It has a Raghu Rai-like feel. The framing is just a bit off, and some parts require dodging, but the composition is beautiful.   Keep shooting. Photography is just a game of numbers. You shoot a 100, identify 10 good ones, work on them, 5 will be nice, 3 will be great, and after a while, 1 will be simply amazing. You collect this one picture every months, and over years, you'll have a great collection.  Here is a stream of one of the guys I follow This guy's camera is a machine gun. He just points and sprays! But many of his candids are true candids."
ABCDesis,36nqib,bug-bear,5,Thu May 21 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"To tag onto all you've said...from what I've seen in general, framing seems to be most people's weakness. Really practice framing!!!  Also, learn to edit, but also learn when it's too much!"

I shot from the top of the TV when I got her a new one to replace her old ""Box"" TV with a flat screen.   I liked a couple of the stuff from Manchester Pride, the guy with the Vuvuzela was the first time I tried street photography and I quite like it since it's literally the most happy person I have ever met considering my line of work doesn't let me see a lot of happy people!   I also like the upside down photo of the baby. Those are the three favourites of my first year of photography."

ABCDesis,36n0ef,Gunther_Normandy,-1,Wed May 20 18:43:35 2015 UTC,I don't think flight controllers can cancel a flight. They tell the airline when a plane can and cannot take off. It's the airlines responsibility to take off and land during the assigned slot.  The airport provides space for the airlines. It doesn't handle any of the ticketing.
ABCDesis,36n0ef,hahaheehaha,7,Wed May 20 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"As someone who is an aviation buff, let me try and answer some of these points:   -ATC doesn't cancel flights. The only way ATC can cancel or delay flights is if the airport authorities or ground control instruct them to do that (due to weather, runway issues, gate congestion, etc). -Counter operations are handled by the Airline Ops.  -They probably didn't cancel the flight at midnight because if there is any chance, even a small one, that a flight will depart, they will hold it. The airline has to make money, after all ;). -That special flight, isn't special. SWA was probably just looking for a spare plane to take you guys to your destination. Considering how dense their network is, I'm surprised they told you they were ""creating a special flight"", lol.  -It's not easy ""to find 2 pilots around BWI"". That's not how scheduling works. I'm sure SWA would have had people on standby, but maybe those 2 pilots got called away for a more urgent flight or schedule. All of this scheduling and rerouting magic is done at the Airline Ops center. While us passengers bitch and moan, Ops is trying to figure out how to reshuffle the entire system and get us where we are going. One cancellation can throw the whole system out of wack."

Hope to contribute in some way.   A bit about myself:   30/born in Gujarat and brought up in US. I enjoy reading DIY projects and watching tv. My favorite tv shows are GoT and Homeland. I am a moviebuff. I try to watch at least one movie a day. I've lost count of the movies I've seen. I have been doing ""one movie a night"" trend since 9th grade. So, imagine the countless movies I've watched. I like EDM and trip-hop music.   To fill up my free time, I think I am going to learn a bit about ""cardistry"" and see if I can learn and pick up a few skills.   Right now, my fave music/band according to my mood at the moment is Massive Attacks. I am currently listening to ""I against I"" with Massive Attacks and Mos Def.

ABCDesis,36i6vr,anirvan,6,Tue May 19 15:58:09 2015 UTC,"All the conversation on different ways of being (or not being) Muslim reminds of the Totally Radical Muslims (TRM) zine project.  TRM started off as a literary space for leftie/artsy/queer/feminist Muslims (many South Asian) from around Oakland, California. Here’s how they describe the project on their website:   surviving and being a muslim in this political moment is a constant struggle and political act.  this zine is to lift up the perspectives of often untold muslims - the radicals, queers, fabulous and fierce folks - through adding narratives of navigating the spectrum of practice, belief, ideology, sect, gender and islamophobia.  this zine is about resistance and resilience, and us telling the stories for ourselves with all their edges, contradictions, beauties and gems.  this is about saying no to islamophobia and being racialized and politicized because of our muslim identity - regardless of how secular, radical, and culturally muslim we are.  this is about saying yes to the liberation of all people.  yes to being allied with, and an ally for others.  this is taking a step towards our collective healing.   They welcome submissions from all kinds of Muslims:   Submission invited from all self-identified Muslims – queer, trans, straight, questioning, and more… We especially welcome submissions from voices often left out of Muslim discourse: incarcerated and recently released, queer and trans, black, youth, disabled, Shia, Ahmadi, poor, working class, refugees, folks in occupied and war ravaged lands.  We see you.   You can download the first three issues online for $2 each; they deal with themes of Islamophobia, love, and resistance.  (And if you’re interested, there are just 4 days left to submit a piece for their latest issue, on the theme of rage — text, photos, and videos.)"
ABCDesis,36i6vr,K_M_H_,6,Tue May 19 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"My commie Muslim self adores this; thank you for the recommendation! One of the reasons I don't hang around r/islam is because the sense of radical politics, or even tamer forms of social justice, is so devoid there. That is a frame of justice that is anti-oppressive, and not selectively so. This is mirrored in a lot of Muslim communities irl as well, and I think not always due to some fidelity to reactionary thinking but often ignorance: we encourage our children to go into the natural sciences, to mathematics, to engineering, to business, but what of the social sciences? The humanities? What of encouraging our youth to be teachers, activists, in the media (Muslims love to drop Mehdi Hasan or Reza Aslan or Malcolm X or Aamer Rahman quotes, but not take up their vocations!), artists, intellectuals, academics, etc. Because of izzat, or financial instability, tradition, or etc. Not always malicious reasons, again mind you, but those that I think stagnate our community's diversity and inclination towards justice. Which angers me, because is not the central theme of the Qur'an justice through piety, and not /only/ the latter? ""O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous"" [2:21]  ANYWAYS, SORRY FOR THE RANT, I HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BUT TY FOR THE READ"

Among the doctors, I found that the attitudes between India and US were the same- the male doctors and the female doctors treated each other with the same respect and openness. However, the interactions between the doctors and the OR nurses was what shocked me a little bit. The OR nurses treated the doctors like gods (as though their own skills were useless/worthless, and the world would stop turning if that surgeon did not exist) and the surgeons sort of treated the OR nurses like ""dumb little girls"", instead of skilled practitioners that had valuable banks of knowledge."
ABCDesis,36hc6p,oinkyy,6,Tue May 19 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"I find the biggest problem in India is that the doctors and nurses don't really listen to the patient. Maybe it's because I'm a young woman, but a lot of them just tend to brush off your concerns or they have a patronising attitude."

They are quick and able and come up with elegant solutions.  The only difficulty I have is that they ask my permission for almost every little thing and they rarely innovate or present ideas without being goaded. They wait for me to tell them to do something. This might be due to the difference in social constructs in the US and India.

You either find people who will do just the bare minimum to get by or will overwork themselves to death. There are also weird command hierarchies in place. When I was fresh out of college on my first job, I was getting up to speed on both the tech and functional aspects of my assignment. I asked my boss, very casually, what he was working on. He said ""yeah I'm your boss you can't really ask me that"". As opposed to my boss here, who is a ""legendary"" coder according to his peers and he'll be happy to hear my feedback about the most mundane of things.

I had to send them very detailed instructions on what analysis I wanted done.  The thing to realize about these offshore consulting firms are that they pay very bad starting salaries and hire many thousands every year. You get what you pay for.  However, they're really good at following clearly written instructions. If you leave the problems a little open ended, you'd get useless junk, but if you're very detailed in what you're asking for they can be good assets.   but there is absolutely no sanity checking, nor is there any ""application"" of the data they found   Yes, they're also very bad a quickly checking for numbers to see if it makes sense.

Vendors had a very lackadaisical attitude and were constantly unprepared.  I was on the global team and supported regions from all over. The India and Rio offices were by far the most frustrating.   Edit: I should clarify that I'm not ascribing the negatives to all Indians - I understand that it's a different work mentality and I was the fish out of water. I was also frustrated with my German counterparts because though they would bust their ass during the work hours, when they went on vacation they went off the grid.

That said, this professor's comments are extremely stupid and something I'd expect from a suburban middle schooler, not a college professor. To call anti-Asian racism the same brand as anti-black racism in America shows a complete lack of understanding of history. I can't find the exact picture, but I remember seeing an 18th century graphic depicting the ""light of civilization,"" and different racial groups on a spectrum. Nearest to the light were whites of course, followed by Russians, the Japanese Hindoos (South Asians), Turks, and more. Asians were actually pretty close to whites and the ""light""; blacks on the other hand, along with aborigines, were placed right next to Neanderthals. Any reading of American history will emphasize that while there certainly was racism towards all groups, there was a special brand reserved for blacks that still manifests itself today.   The professor is also a dumbass for his analysis of social trends. South Asians generally don't change their names but are considered a ""model minority"" as well. And to say that there is no black-white interracial dating is absolutely ridiculous. I am, again, very confused at how someone in his position could be so misinformed. Oh, and as an Asian and ""model minority,"" I want to profusely thank American blacks for the stance they took on racial discrimination that has made so much progress today."

I started running 6 months ago, and it's been a daily part of my life. I mainly got into running because I read a Murakami book on the subject and got inspired. I ran one day, and felt awful, weak, and impotent. I wanted to throw up. My legs were aching. I ran again the next day, aches and pains and all. It was a lot easier, that time. I went the next day, too.  Running is my way of getting/feeling disciplined. It's a way of making something constant in my life. I know that during some point in the day, I'm going to wake up, I'm going to sleep, and I'm going to run. And no matter how shitty I'm feeling, running makes everything better. It's a very therapeutic experience. Luckily, running is quite simple, too. When I started, I just ran. Apart from a coupke adjustments to my routine, I do pretty much the same thing now. Run. It's easy  If I had to sell running to someone else, I'd sell it as a lifestyle. Specifically running, not anything else. Fuck health. I still eat what I want; I don't track my calories. I didn't track my distance for a while, at the beginning. Running is about feeling, about reptition, about learning to cope with pain and uncomfortability, and ultimately finding pleasure there. Anyone with functioning legs can run; it's just a matter of committing. And when you commit yourself to running, everything feels better.  Also, the scenery. Like seriously, have you ever seriously explored your local parks? Run (or tried to run) up a mountain? Experienced the majesty of running lakeside at morning, or during the night? (Mosquitoes suck, though.) Running is a good way to understand yourself, but it's also a good way to explore the world around you. And it's simple, too. Seriously, try it!"

ABCDesis,36fng0,hahaheehaha,5,Tue May 19 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"Long walks at night: I started them in high school. I love the quiet in the middle of the night and walking lets me appreciate the little things around me. Walking at night is also perfect for contemplation and reflection! I strongly urge everyone to try this out at least once. The solitude is soothing. :)     Messing around with makeup: I was a tomboy growing up, so I never thought I'd enjoy makeup. I got into it quite late (second year of uni)... I don't quite remember exactly what it was that got me to start using it, but I'm glad I finally did! I don't use it all the time, but the happier and less stressed out I am, the more likely I will wear makeup that day. I see it as a form of art, and it really has boosted my self-confidence.     Watching films: I love movies. Hollywood, Bollywood, French cinema, Korean cinema... I'll watch it all! It's very interesting to see how people decide to portray something. Everyone has their own twist to add to the story! My favourite genres are historical, comedy, and romance. AND DOCUMENTARIES. I absolutely love watching documentaries.     Pet therapy: I volunteered for a health program at my school and one branch of it dealt with mental health. I was on the global health team, but one of the mental health volunteers was sick one day so I took his spot at a pet therapy session. There's something about therapy dogs that I just can't explain... I feel so at peace and happy when I'm volunteering at these sessions (probably because I get to play with the dogs as well!)."

A lot of my friends were always confused why I would be willing to drive back home at 2-3am in the morning, but at that time there is no traffic and it's really a cathartic and peaceful. Also great for contemplation and reflection as well."

ABCDesis,36fng0,1000timesover,3,Tue May 19 12:23:32 2015 UTC,Fellow movie buff here. I have a running log of every amazing movie I have ever watched. Wanna trade notes?
ABCDesis,36fng0,recycledpaper,2,Tue May 19 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I wish I had thought to do that! I'll start keeping a catalogue from now on. What genres do you like and of those, which ones are you fav movies? The last movies I watched were The Painted Veil (2006) and Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006). TPV was okay; not bad, but nothing spectacular. It had a beautiful soundtrack though. Definitely give it a listen if you get the time! :) As for Perfume... I honestly still don't know what to think of it. I hadn't read the novel before watching the film, and I tend to avoid trailers, so I had no idea what to expect. It started off pretty interesting to me, but the ending was eh. I would not recommend it to others."
ABCDesis,36fng0,hahaheehaha,5,Tue May 19 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"Hmmm hobbies....  I love to bake. I initially got into it because my mother did not like to make American desserts (""why make them when you can buy them!"") because they were too time consuming (this is rich considering she fried her own pani puri puris once). I love the feeling of having a finished product at the end that is delicious and I can share with someone. I really enjoy bringing in baked goods to work (suddenly the nurses LOVE me!). I would probably sell this as a way to get people to like you. Sure you can bring in some bakery cookies but bring in some homemade cookies and suddenly you have something to talk about.  I also volunteer with a sexual assault organization in town. I basically accompany women who need rape kits done in the hospital. I started because when I realized I was interested in ob/gyn I knew I wanted to improve my skills at handling unfortunate situations, so I decided to put myself on the other side of the bed and see what the patient needed/wanted from a doctor. While I certainly learned good ways of talking to a patient, I am truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from women. Many of the women I meet are stronger than they know and I feel good knowing that they know they can get through this. Many of the other women I volunteer with are also survivors of sexual abuse and it is inspiring to see them in a position where they can help others. I don't think this is a good volunteer thing for a lot of people because it can take a lot out of you emotionally. I have come home many times ready to quit because it angers me to see such pain. But it is worth it to help someone know that you are their cheerleader and see them become empowered to make decisions so soon after someone else tried to take that away from them.  I also crochet but seriously I haven't touched it in a month since it frustrates me."

ABCDesis,36fng0,_blend_,5,Tue May 19 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"What are your hobbies?   I guess first would be art - though I don't do nearly as much of it as I used because I get so burnt out at work. I tend to cycle through crafts. I just like making stuff with my hands. I love puzzles. LOVE THEM. Started cross stitching recently. And I like watching TV shows and playing video games some.   What got you into it initially?   Always been into art, since I was a kid. Crafts goes sort of along with that. With puzzles, I remember spending time with my cousins trying to do puzzles when I was younger and I thought I'd give it another go (because we sucked back then). I don't know if there's one thing that got me into shows and games, probably just friends.   What have you gotten out of it?   Art and crafts I just enjoy making things. Puzzles I find really relaxing, it's something I don't have to think about a lot and there's a nice feeling of accomplishment when you match pieces. I think cross-stitching is a nice cross between the two. TV and games are ways to spend time with my husband.   If you had to sell your hobby to someone uninitiated, what would you say to get them interested?   Uh...let's make some shit?"
ABCDesis,36fng0,oinkyy,5,Tue May 19 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"What are your hobbies?   I've recently taken up (indoor) rock climbing.   What got you into it initially?   After walking past the climbing wall at my gym hundreds of times, one day I decided to try out the intro to climbing session, where they just strap you into your harness and point you at the wall. I've been hooked ever since!   What have you gotten out of it?   It's one of the first forms of exercise I truly have fun with. Fitness is nice side effect, but I climb because I enjoy climbing.   If you had to sell your hobby to someone uninitiated, what would you say to get them interested?   Rock climbing/bouldering is like solving a giant first-person 3d puzzle with your body. It's a lot less about upper body strength, and a lot more about how you place your body, where you rest your weight on, how you twist, turn, reach for holds. It's an incredible rush when you get stuck on a move that seems impossible, but suddenly becomes easy when you position your feet and hips slightly differently."
ABCDesis,36fng0,analystdude,4,Tue May 19 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"What are your hobbies?   My hobbies are dog (particularly Greyhound!) rescue, cooking, and music (singing in particular.)   What got you into it initially?   Greyhound rescue: I knew I'd wanted a dog all my life, but I was looking for a large dog that worked well in apartments. After doing some research on the breed, I settled on a retired racing greyhound. I had such a good experience with the adoption group I worked with, that I started getting involved myself and now I'm on the board of the adoption group! Cooking mainly started as a necessity. The only cooking I learned growing up was some very not-so-interesting South Indian dishes, but going away to college really opened up my palette. Since going out to eat is expensive, I decided to try my hand at cooking myself (I lived in an apartment through most of college, so I had access to a stove and stuff) and taught myself to cook what I liked. Music has been a thing since I was little- I always sang in choirs and took Hindustani vocal classes from a young-ish age. In college, I was heavily involved in musical theatre, the women's chorus, as well as a co-ed a cappella group on campus.    What have you gotten out of it?    All three for me provide an outlet from my actual work (science) which I'm decent at but don't get a whole lot of enjoyment out of. Greyhound rescue allows me to be around dogs (and I'm never happier than when I'm surrounded by dogs) and feel good that I'm helping to place dogs into good homes. Cooking allows me to go full nerd on food: learning about ingredients, the roles they play in food both flavor-wise and structural, and how to optimize cooking methods. Music...has been a constant in my life. I don't know what drives me to do it, other than I feel uncomfortable and incomplete without it.    If you had to sell your hobby to someone uninitiated, what would you say to get them interested?   As far as greyhounds go, all I'd say to any dog lover is that you just need to meet one of these dogs. They are so sweet and so wonderful and so loving, they will just melt your heart. Cooking: what's more satisfying than making something yourself? Optimizing a recipe to suit your exact tastes? There's something really fulfilling about that. And as far as music goes...once you get involved in a musical pursuit, it changes your life in a way that makes you feel weird and unhappy if you don't keep going with it."
ABCDesis,36fng0,GodModeONE,3,Tue May 19 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"What are your hobbies?   Powerlifting Martial arts, more specifically boxing Soccer Video games   What got you into it initially?   Powerlifting - I wanted to get back in shape 3 years ago, picked up a generic routine which focussed on the big 3 lifts (Stronglifts 5x5 for anyone curious), made a lot of progress, loved lifting heavy shit, continue doing it. Martial arts/boxing - was always into watching martial arts movies (huge Bruce Lee fan). So when I was in high school, I decided to learn boxing. Learnt it on and off. Trained in Krav Maga for 2 years, now back to just boxing. Soccer - played for my high school team Video games - have always been into video games since NES days. I now work in the games industry, so it's super fun. I can just claim ""research"" and play games at work.   What have you gotten out of it?   Powerlifting - got much stronger than I was before. My body looks halfway decent. Boxing - I can hold my own in a regular 1x1 fight (never had to fight on the streets, thank god). But if it comes to that and if there are no weapons involved, I can pretty much gain the upper hand if fighting someone untrained. Soccer - it's a fun group activity that helps make friends. Video games - helps me relax, while learning new things about the industry   If you had to sell your hobby to someone uninitiated, what would you say to get them interested?   Powerlifting - a good beginner strength routine is probably the best way to start off in the gym if someone's looking to get in shape. A generic bodybuilding routine would work too, but it's a little hard for beginners and makes it easier to give up. Martial arts - punching a heavy bag is one of the most therapeutic things. You learn valuable life skills. Getting hit in the face will teach you that you're not made of glass, but also in a weird way makes you aware of your own mortality and how fickle life is (it got too deep, sorry), because all it takes is one well timed punched to send someone into a comatose state. Soccer - fun activity to do with friends. One of the easiest sports to pick up, but hard to master. All you need are some people, a ball and open space. Video games - video games are now some of the most valuable entertainment properties. It's no longer for the nerds. There are games for everyone. You should try some."

ABCDesis,36fnty,ktchn,6,Tue May 19 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"Listened to the podcast. I don't think the prosecution actually did a good job trying their case, but after considering the alternatives I fo believe he's guilty.   The linchpin for me was the Jay (his dealer/friend) knew the whereabouts of Hae's car. So that rules out a random third party, which quite frankly was what I had hoped for.  I don't think Jay had any compelling reason to kill her. Strangulation is a very intimate crime as well. So I really only think he did it because I don't think Jay did.  Also I never found the whole I can't remember anything story compelling. We're not discussing any random day months after the fact. The day in question adnan was called by the police. I don't care how high you are something like that happens, you remember what you were up to."
ABCDesis,36fnty,shashafierce,1 point,Tue May 19 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"I also think he's probably guilty. The most salient piece of evidence in my mind is that the day before Hae disappeared, Adnan obsessively called/paged her several times, but as soon as she disappeared he apparently never tried to get in contact with her.   According to him, in the days after her disappearance he was keeping in touch with her friends, asking them for updates on her whereabouts, so he never felt the need to contact her directly. That seems pretty suspicious to me."

Some did their research and were impressed once they found out how prestigious it is.  Lucky for me, I don't really give a shit what others think of what I do. I knew how hard I worked to get there.  If you want my opinion, USAF treats their people the best. Best housing, best food, always have air conditioning if you get deployed. I have a lot of friends that went through grad school on the Air Force's dime by being reserve officers."

In my experience, my family was extremely supportive once they got over their initial fears, and all our relatives/family friends were too (uncles used to love to call me ""Leftenant"".) And after I separated from active duty, the GI Bill (and the fact that tax-free deployments helped me save quite a bit) helped me sail through law school with zero debt, which is fairly rare these days."

He's a damn smart guy, doing a double major in STEM, and he's deeply into martial arts. He -- like pretty much everyone I've talked to about joining the armed forces -- is obsessed with becoming a SEAL. He knows the consequences, he knows the dangers, and he has a good idea of how he'll be used -- but he's choosing to enlist as a way to test himself, to understand himself. It may seem crazy to others, but I'm proud of him and his resolve.  He hasn't told his parents yet, but he's pretty sure that they'll be shocked. Nevertheless, he's made up his mind at this point.  Cool guy. I wish him the best of luck. And I know that I didn't exactly answer your question, but I just wanted you to know that you're not alone in your decision."

He also goes to drill one weekend every month and to a special training mission thing for 3 weeks every year.   My dad doesn't really care anymore that he's in the army now that it's been so long. My mom still hates it and will always hate it. I was super worried for him obviously when he was overseas, but luckily he made it back safely. He has had to sacrifice some important moments in his friends lives because of army commitments (weddings, babies being born, etc) but I think he still really enjoys being in the Army. He's a Sergeant now so there is more office time than before but I think he's okay with that. He did the engineering corps and mostly helped build temporary bridges and things like that.

I was trained as a nuclear reactor operator, which required 2 years of school / training before I was assigned to a boat. The last 3 years were spent on an aircraft carrier, with approximately 65% of my time spent on deployment.   Parents weren't involved in the decision. I joined mostly to leave the home situation I was in at the time. Family was eventually supportive, but also happy when I left and went to school to get my degree.

ABCDesis,36dznb,GreaterIndia,10,Mon May 18 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of weird in this category.  So, I'm largely agnostic, I do believe in a higher being, but I don't believe in any particular religion. I was born in a Muslim household, but still identify myself as a South Asian Muslim as a cultural identity. I participate in all the religious festivities and even observe some aspects of the faith (I fast during Ramadan).  There was a time when I was younger that I had completely rejected the faith of my family, but as I grow older, I'm actually being drawn back into it. I sometimes even wonder if I should just stop calling myself an agnostic, since it would be disingenuous and start calling myself Muslim again.  Man, I'm the definition of an American Born Confused Desi."
ABCDesis,36dznb,Klupa,5,Tue May 19 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, religion means culture for a lot of people, so you can be whatever you want to be. There are practicing Muslims, non-practicing Muslims, agnostics or non-believers who still identify as Muslim, and non-believers who don't call themselves Muslim just because they're opposed to the idea of religion or because they feel they were never a part of that culture. :)"
ABCDesis,36dznb,GreaterIndia,5,Tue May 19 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"That's largely true, and I wonder if this is the case for others out there, who leave the faith, but after exploring other religious traditions or even abstinence from religion, do end up returning.   Again, I haven't made that leap to return to being Muslim, but I felt I owed it to myself to give it one more chance and study the texts and what not and look at it from different perspectives before I make that decision.  I've always wondered if there are people who identify themselves as ex-Muslims or at least non-practicing, non-religious Muslims who have returned to the fold so to speak.  I'm just rambling lol"

ABCDesis,36dznb,mudgod2,11,Tue May 19 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"If you're in the U.S. or Canada, check out the Ex-Muslims of North America (exmna.org).  They describe themselves as:   We are a group of people dedicated to supporting and helping ex-Muslims. The primary reason for our group’s existence is to provide a sense of solidarity and community for ‘ex-Muslims’ – people who used to follow Islam or identify as Muslim, and who no longer do so. As such, this group is only for ex-Muslims, primarily those located in or from North America. (source)   I really appreciate their thoughtful critique of both anti-Muslim xenophobia and pro-Muslim apologism (source):   No Bigotry and No Apologism  These days, there is a stark polarity that exists in media, academia and public life when it comes to discussions about Islam and Muslims. There are those who propagate racist, bigoted and xenophobic ideas against Muslims, against anyone who comes from a Muslim background, and even against people who are not Muslim at all (e.g. Sikhs). These types of people (the bigots) tend to treat all Muslims (or all those perceived to be Muslim) as a monolith, a horde without internal differences or dissent. On the other hand, there are those who react to the bigoted, xenophobic types by trying to justify the violent parts of Islam and the harsh actions of some Muslims. This second type (the apologists) often shields Islam and Muslims from any and all critique and scrutiny, even the kinds of critique and scrutiny they themselves apply to other ideologies like Christianity, Capitalism, Communism, and others.  As people who were raised Muslim, or converted to Islam of our own choice, and then left Islam because we could not believe in it anymore, we stand between this polarity, and we refuse to cater to either the bigots or the apologists. We do not wish to promote hatred of all Muslims. We ourselves were Muslim. Many of our families and friends are Muslim. We understand that Muslims come in all varieties and we do not and will not partake in erasing the diversity within the world’s Muslims.  Most of us have researched and continue to research many of the world’s religions, and we are, as a group, very well-versed in the horrors committed by other religions throughout history. We reserve the right to focus on Islam because it is the religion with which we have the most experience, it is the religion in which many of us were raised, and the religion some of us who are former converts tried to believe in with all our hearts.  While we denounce the bigotry of those who promote their racist and xenophobic ideas under the guise of criticizing Muslims, we also denounce the cultural and moral relativism of those who propagate the idea that all people of Muslim backgrounds are the same and want to follow Islam, and that Islam is somehow less capable of being scrutinized than other belief systems. We are the people who have both first-hand and well-researched knowledge about Islam and we bridge the worlds between the polarized discussions of Islam through our lives and our voices."

ABCDesis,36dznb,x6tance,7,Mon May 18 23:41:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting article.  The data is even more revealing, however, when you break it down even further. Whilst each new generation generally becomes less socially and religiously conservative than their parents, the reverse is happening in the British-Pakistani community.  Here is an Economist article comparing the Bangledeshi and Pakistani communities:   http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21644155-britain-bangladeshis-have-overtaken-pakistanis-credit-poor-job-market-when-they-arrived  This government document would suggest that young British-Pakistanis are falling back on their Muslim identity when confronted with their diminishing connections to Pakistan. Particularly language.  'The identity of different generations varies, with the elders from the first generation still feeling a strong connection towards their country of birth. The second generation also has a deep connection to Pakistan, but to a much lesser extent than their parents. The third generation of young people see themselves as primarily British and this forms a strong part of their identity. As the country of birth of their parents and grandparents, they still have a deep personal or psychological association with Pakistan, but one that is a substantially diminished part of their own personal identity in comparison to their parents. However, the majority of community members of all ages and generations unequivocally describe themselves as British Muslims.'   http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http:/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/1170952.pdf  'The identity factor, which explains that a language may be vital to the maintenance of some community’s identity, was already touched upon when refering to the immigrant community’s core values.'  http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Language-use-and-attitudes-of-the-British-born-Pakistani-community-in-Manchester.pdf  It is an interesting question and a rather sad situation that one group of British-Muslims seems to be drifting farther away rather than the reverse."
ABCDesis,36dznb,IndianAmericanteen,4,Mon May 18 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"British Desis are so different from their American, Canadian, and Australian counterparts. It's probably cause of the generation or two extra, but, it's always interesting to note. I wonder if these other English speaking countries will follow similar trends of Desi folks in UK"
ABCDesis,36dznb,Master_AK,-1,Mon May 18 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"British desis seem to be more conservative and I really hope America, Canada and Australia don't follow suit"
ABCDesis,36dznb,Master_AK,8,Mon May 18 19:37:04 2015 UTC,Conservative in what way? The Desi community is certainly a lot stronger in the UK but the majority of people still assimilate very well. In fact you probably find far less Desis with self hatred issues or ones that have been completely white washed in the UK. The majority of people are very proud to be British while not disregarding or putting down their ethnic heritage.
ABCDesis,36dznb,asdfioho,2,Mon May 18 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to the UK so I don't know how accurate this is, but based on what I've read, it seems that British Muslims are struggling when it comes to assimilating compared to British Hindus and Sikhs. This doesn't apply to all British Muslims obviously, but British Muslims seem to be more conservative and more prone to radicalization compared to American Muslims. One reason is because many British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis come from the more rural and uneducated parts of Pakistan and Bangladesh, while American Desis need to be educated in order to immigrate here.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11409181/British-Muslims-integration-and-segregation-are-about-economics-not-values.html  The article here talks about how when it comes to education, Hindus are doing way better compared to the UK as a whole, Sikhs are doing somewhat better than the UK population, but Muslims are not performing as well compared to the other two groups."
ABCDesis,36dznb,IndianAmericanteen,7,Mon May 18 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"I was speaking mostly from my experiences as a British Hindu, I would say most of us have assimilated very well while retaining our cultural identity. I also know Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims that have integrated very well too (Gujarati, Sindhi and some from Lahore/Dhaka), the groups that tend to be more conservative and more prone to radicalism seem to hail from certain areas such as Mirpur or poorer areas in Bangladesh. Those people were struggling, uneducated and conservative before they came to the UK, they haven't become like that in the UK , they were always like that.  As you said the USA and Australia have stricter immigration/skill requirements, I'm pretty sure if those were relaxed you would have the same problem in those countries."
ABCDesis,36dznb,GreaterIndia,2,Mon May 18 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"This has a lot to do with the socioeconomic status of those groups respectively back at home. The majority of Hindus in the diaspora are from educated urban backgrounds, the majority of Sikhs are from relatively well-off or at least sustainable rural backgrounds, and while there is a huge range, the majority of Muslims in that context are from socioeconomically backwards areas. This was actually the exact same demographic in Western Punjab for a century or so."

Dialogue and understanding between groups are the way things will move forward, people.   The atheist struggle can be quite real (even if it's a cliche on reddit) since people do get disowned, kicked out of the house etc. If not such extremes, social relations will inevitably take a hit. There's usually no going back to 'normal' if you come out to your Muslim family as a nonbeliever.

It's not a hat so much as a crown, a formal garment even outside of the religious significance. However, a key principle of Sikhi is service towards all people, and the turban cloth is probably a really good bandage, so I do see this as an exemplary way of living thr ideals that the turban supposedly represents for us."

My expectations going into the movie were pretty high, due to all the reviews but I was still blown away. The action scenes in the movie are some of the best I've ever seen. The chase sequences in this movie make all other chase sequences look like a puppet show. Strong female leads - Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the star of the movie. But, the character development is done in a way that it doesn't seem patronizing. Character development - it's subtle, yet brings the point across. You know the motivation behind every one of the lead characters. Tom Hardy. 'nuff said."

I feel like he's probably more envious of my dad's financial situation and my success being a byproduct of that more than anything. That would make more sense in my mind.

ABCDesis,36c8hw,UltraDown,3,Mon May 18 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"and by the way good luck to you. Med school-> Residency is a long, hard road and you clearly want to do it despite discouragement, a large loan burden, and what seems like a pretty good awareness of the workload you're in for.  I'm married to a physician (since med school), and it's gonna be tough. There are a lot of tradeoffs to be made. You'll have very little control over your life for the foreseeable future. Personal time will become a thing that you can no longer expect to have.   But if being a physician is that inner burning need that can't be satisfied by any other path in life, then you're doing the right thing. And of course, post-residency your lifestyle will vary depending on your specialty. My wife is an anesthesiologist, so she still has a pretty brutal work schedule. we have friends in other specialties who have much better work/life balances. it all depends on what grills your cheese."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,bug-bear,2,Mon May 18 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yea, I'm preparing myself mentality. I also realize that school and work are going to be so stressful and I'm trying to make it so that any unnecessary stressors (such as this whole situation) are most eliminated going forward.   Wow! That's amazing that your wife is an anesthesiologist! Kudos to her! I know that's a highly sought after speciality and also one that not very many women pursue! My inner feminist is overjoyed haha!"
ABCDesis,36c8hw,M55B30,2,Mon May 18 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"that's changing-- when my wife was interviewing for post-residency positions, most of the practices were male dominated.  However, her residency class, and the three after her at her med school were mostly female. My guess is that this mirrors the overall US demographics where the number of women as a whole exceed the number of men in college. I'd guess by the time you're out of residency, the idea of physicians being a male-dominated profession will be an artifact of the past."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,formal_shorts,3,Mon May 18 20:37:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I have some friends currently in residency and med school both male and female that totally still see the effect of a homogenous male-dominated profession at play. But I do see a bigger influx of minorities (specifically African Americans) slowly and surely as well as those who identify as LGBT...when I was going through the admission process I know those who identified as a minority in medicine through gender, sexual orientation, race, etc. were very encouraged to apply (and often recruited). It will be very fascinating to see what the world of medicine looks 8+ years from now when I'm finished with my training.   On a separate note, it's so refreshing to see an Indian male as such a strong advocate for women! I don't know too many Indian males as the area in the US I'm from tends to be less populated with Desis but gosh your remarks are a breath of fresh air! You totally made my day!"
ABCDesis,36c8hw,formal_shorts,4,Mon May 18 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations on your admission!!! It sounds like you've done really well for yourself in undergrad (studying abroad on a scholarship sounds so amazing! And you're presenting at a conference!!) and will continue to do well in medical school. Whenever all the drama gets to be too much, just remember how much more awesome you are than them.  Sounds like your uncle has some super-weird fixation on you getting a job. You're right that literally none of this is any of his business, but that never seems to stop the uncles and aunties haha. I'm not 100% sure, but I think most medical schools have policies against students getting full-time jobs. And even if they don't, I highly doubt that anyone would be able to balance studying and working. So if your uncle's comments get to be too much, you can just say something like that.  I agree with the other commentor that it sounds like your uncle is just jealous, and unfortunately it seems like he's poisoned the minds of his daughters against you too. If the comments get too bad, the best thing, I think, would be to just cut him off as you did before. You say that your dad and he are very close, but more importantly, you are his daughter. I had a kind of similar situation where I had to basically cut off an auntie who was making harassing remarks like that. My parents definitely pressured me to ""just apologize"" and ""reconcile"" to avoid drama, but I refused. And a few years afterward, my dad told me that, with hindsight, he thinks I made the right decision and that he was glad I kept my dignity. So if you explain the whole situation to your father, hopefully he will be able to understand your decision.  My family also has that deadbeat male cousin character... and it's definitely infuriating how no one ever says anything to him, since he's the only guy in our generation and ""the one who will carry on the family line."" So it's probably just a sexist conservative family thing."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,MrWonderfullyBrown,2,Mon May 18 07:07:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you sooo much for your kind words! This really helped me feel better. Most med schools do have that policy, and I absolutely plan on using that. I'll talk to my dad more extensively about it. He sort of uses the whole ""what would you do if something ever happened to me"" card as a means to convince me to talk to my uncle...which I find rather annoying b/c at the expense of sounding callous, I think I'll be able to manage in the event something did happen to my dad, but anyways...  This is definitely sexism that's surfacing now (and it's crazy it is b/c you'd think he would have discouraged me from medicine or whatever if he was that sexist... though he totally wanted me to get hitched not to long ago).   When I tried to continue keeping my uncle at a distance, my dad accused me of having an ego (even though they both have one themselves so...) anyways, you're right. I'm going to talk to my dad and just explain the situation to him and see if I can get out of seeing them.   Thanks again!!!"
ABCDesis,36c8hw,MrWonderfullyBrown,2,Mon May 18 07:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your dad's viewpoint is that he wants someone he can trust to take care of his daughter if something happens to him. But it's pretty obvious that your uncle has very little goodwill toward you and likely wouldn't care well for you in that case. Plus you are getting to the point where you are moving toward an independent career, so you are definitely right about not really needing your uncle anymore. I think explaining both of those things will help your dad be less worried about your future.  I know what you mean about the sexism! I'm in kind of the same situation. Everyone in my family wants to pressure me into going into medicine, but they also want me to get married super early. I may be being unfair, but I think part of it is the trophy wife mentality. Like, they think the ideal woman is pretty and fair-skinned, good at housework, and well-educated. And a MD is like the ultimate pinnacle of education for desi families. At least that's the vibe I get from my own family, which can be pretty sexist but has still always pushed for me to become a doctor. Maybe some sort of similar mentality is going on with yours."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,MrWonderfullyBrown,3,Mon May 18 07:39:23 2015 UTC,"Aww hugs I'm sorry to hear about the prevailing sexism in your family. I had to literally argue back and forth with my dad and uncle about the whole marry early issue. All the women in our family got married by 21. I'm 22 so... breaking traditions! Anyways, I agree about all of those ideologies. It's also hard for me to try to get them to see they hold them  and see that they are no longer true. Idk about the MD part. Like I said, I'd be the first in my family to be a doctor. The highest level of education achieved by immediate and extended family (only up to first cousins) has been Masters. I think me pursuing a career in medicine is something my parents love, but it also came with warnings about lifestyle along the way. It's also something that my uncle has never understood and has been borderline discouraging throughout the years. For instance, he was like ""do you really want to work those long hours?"" to which my response was ""I can't see myself doing any other career that I'd enjoy more..."" Though this may have been a bit naive (as no one really enjoys working long hours), I still stand by the fact that I can't see myself doing anything better with my life. Or something else like ""It's so much school. Why don't you go into pharmacy instead? It's still healthcare."" Throwing in things that I may not have considered as if I wasn't making an informed decision, you know? Or recently his latest condescending remarks like ""All you have is a brain, nothing more than that. You don't have any real life experience blah blah blah.""  (Harsh much!) Anyways, so I think even though my family def holds sexist sentiments, for whatever reason, when it came to my career (at least from my dad) I never felt this way.   I do need to get better at explaining the independent career thing to my dad. I think he's just worried... but I don't know how to comfort him. He literally thinks I would need an older person or whatever and my mom isn't enough (presumably b/c she's a woman). But thanks for telling me to explain that. I'll have to figure out how so he understands."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,MrWonderfullyBrown,3,Mon May 18 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly just humor them... and then when it becomes dramatic... quietly pull away. They are perhaps upset about their own situation, and will do things to gas light you into bringing you down to their realm."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,b_digital,2,Mon May 18 10:23:42 2015 UTC,"Humor them how? Yea, I'll just have to refrain from saying anything whenever he brings up in my mind completely taboo topics that are none of his business."
ABCDesis,36c8hw,b_digital,2,Mon May 18 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"I also think he's on the jelly train. He could feel like he missed out, he could feel that his kids won't get the same chance (financial situation).  I think you should tell your dad and let him handle it. For two reasons - 1, if you think he's being sexist, he's not going to listen to you anyway and 2, Dad's family, dad's generation = dad's problem. If uncle comes to you and starts shit, say something along the lines of 'Thanks for your concern but dad and I have it figured out' or 'if you have an issue with it, you should talk to dad'. And give your dad a heads up."

ABCDesis,36c8hw,bug-bear,-4,Mon May 18 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think your uncle is just trying to save your dad from financial issues.   The thought process probably is: My brother is spending a lot of money on his daughter's education. She will get a bachelors degree, and then med school (more financial burden for the parent), and then she will get married while my brother will be stuck with the expenses.   I have no idea how your finances are (or how your dad's finances are) - but this is the only logical explanation because you have mentioned that your dad and his brother are very close.  Maybe your uncle does not know that you have taken loans or whatever, and that may ease his concerns. Or, your dad's finances may not be as good as you think they are.   But overall, I think he is just looking out for your dad."

ABCDesis,36ap7e,desichica,7,Sun May 17 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"This seems like a very problematic study, or at least a very problematic conclusion to draw from the study.   First off, people will be biased to say what is socially acceptable to say.   Second, the answers people give to this question depend on how much interaction they are expected to have with their neighbors at all. America has plenty of racial tensions, but we also mostly keep to ourselves, and not many people bother to get to know their neighbors anymore. The result is a high score, not because we are really that tolerant, but because we wouldn't bother to meet our different-race-neighbors anyways, and they probably wouldn't bother us either.  Third, ""another race"" is so vague that it is almost meaningless. People will have different attitudes towards different races."

ABCDesis,36ap7e,TaazaPlaza,3,Mon May 18 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Few days ago someone posted that video about mainland Indians being intolerant towards africans. Today I can across this old article - http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/  Does mainland india really have a racial tolerance issue?
ABCDesis,36ap7e,mcat36,2,Sun May 17 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"Does mainland india really have a racial tolerance issue?   Thing is, 'race' is not really an Indian concept in my experience. Unlike Europeans or Americans, we don't interact with immigrants from all over the world on a daily basis. Racism in the US would mean whites/Hispanics/etc discriminating against Hispanics, blacks, Asians, etc - These communities see themselves as different races.  What I mean is, most Indians just have an idea of different communities - Caste, religion, and most importantly, ethnicity/linguistic communities. And yeah, there is a lot of community based stereotyping and in some cases discrimination (mainly ethnicity based), but I would never call it racism - Just discrimination or whatever. The closest to racism IMO is discrimination against North East Indians, their culture/features/general lifestyle is so different from the rest of India so as to be perceived as an 'other'.  I'm not sure what 'race' in this survey means - If they were to survey Indians about blacks, Chinese, etc, they'd get pretty ignorant answers I'm sure, but there has been next to no contact between most Indians and these foreign immigrant people.  Also, I'm curious why you use the term 'mainland' Indian."
ABCDesis,36ap7e,mcat36,1 point,Tue May 19 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that you can measure how tolerant a nation is or isn't. It's so subjective, difficult to measure, unmeasurable, and also fraught with error.  However, if I were going to measure multi-dimensional tolerance, we should define it first. That's hard to do, but tolerance has the qualities:   members of minority community should be represented in positions of power. minority shouldn't be discriminated. This is very hard to measure. a tolerant society is an open society which allows foreigners to immigrate the tolerant nation doesn't discriminate at the governmental, social, religious, or economic level of their minority. the tolerant nation doesn't distinguish from where their immigrant pool comes from.   My opinion is that Canada is probably the most tolerant nation on earth.  Least tolerant: Russia, Afghanistan, Israel, Japan, and the oil rich nations."
ABCDesis,36ap7e,KaliYugaz,2,Sun May 17 23:40:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've heard about the xenophobia in Russia, Israel and the middle-east oil countries. Is Japan xenophobic too? A couple of my friends have visited (albeit major cities like Tokyo, Osaka etc). They found the people to be welcoming."
ABCDesis,36ap7e,K_M_H_,4,Mon May 18 00:01:20 2015 UTC,Nobody is allowed to migrate to Japan. I'm sure they'll make special allowances for Scandinavians however.
ABCDesis,36ap7e,IndianAmericanteen,2,Mon May 18 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"Like most countries, it really depends where you are in Japan and what you do there. Larger cities are more cosmopolitan, progressive, and welcoming for foreigners. The natives will treat foreigners hospitably and politely.   However, you frequently face blatant discrimination when it comes to renting apartments, and certain restaurants and nightclubs won't let foreigners in (though I hear this is getting rarer). When it comes to business, they often won't trust you without a Japanese guarantor backing you up.  It also matters what kind of immigrant you are. All immigrants will inspire curiosity, of course, but in addition, they're usually scared of black people, awed by white people, and neutral towards Indians. Brazilians and Southeast Asians are often the targets of anti-gaijin panic because they make up the bulk of foreign laborers. If you're Chinese or Korean, you can usually pass as a native unless you specifically bring attention to your ethnicity, in which case liberals will be fine but ultra-conservatives may not."
ABCDesis,36ap7e,mcat36,2,Mon May 18 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a Canadian: the whole tolerance thing is as much as national myth as reality.

But I was a huge fan of his latest film, ''Radhe Radhe: Rites of Holi'' (watch the trailer), a visually astounding 35-minute collaboration with Vijay Iyer, and one of the most remarkable pieces of film I've ever seen, overlaying Holi with Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring.""

The tapes were played everday and based on the song sequence we could tell if we were going to be late. I still remember this sequence and can sing them all from memory. My parents don't play them anymore and i sometimes wonder if it was deliberate on their part so that we could grow up listening to the sounds of their childhood so far away from home.

When my Dad moved to the US he really assimilated (thinks hamburgers, football, and beer) since there were very few Indians.  By the time I was in my teens though, there was a thriving Indian community and all the other kids my age had two Indian parents, spoke the language(s), and had an extensive network of relatives. Sometimes other Indians will know what I am from my coloring, but mostly people think I am Mexican or Italian.   Now I'm planning to get married next year and I've never even been to an Indian wedding but something in me just wants a red sari and mehndi, but can I justify that since I've really only ever seen it in movies or pictures of distant relatives I've never even met?  Since I never had that big network of aunties trying to teach me to cook I bought Indian cookbooks.  I go out of my way to ask my Dad about the relatives he talks to on the phone every week, and I take it upon myself to learn as much as I can.  Neither my brother nor my sister did that, and it they seem like they really aren't Indian beyond the name and the tan.

ABCDesis,35ynrg,hdpq,11,Thu May 14 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"Hi fellow half-Desi! I'm half-Indian (Bengali) and half-Armenian. I have somewhat ambiguous looks. I have medium-light skin (gets fairly tan in the summer), so I'm not light enough to be mistaken for a white-but-""ethnic"" person. My first and last name are Armenian and my middle is Bengali, and since most people are unfamiliar with Armenian names (outside of SoCal maybe) it further adds to the ambiguity. In general though, if I had to say there was a default that people place me in, it's Indian, but I've had plenty of people ask if I'm Persian, Afghan, Arab, North African, or Latino (including by people of these ethnic groups themselves). Perceptions of me also change depending on which parent I'm with. In India, most people assume I'm Indian, but I am often met with surprise when I say I'm Bengali. Usually people think I'm Punjabi or Gujarati. (Maybe I have more angular features instead of the stereotypical rounder face Bengalis have?)  I didn't really grow up around much of either side of my family, and I didn't really have a huge Indian (or Armenian, for that matter) community that I was a part of (besides school friends), especially since most Indians around me are Gujarati and have a different culture, food, language, etc. That said, I don't think I've ever felt confused with my identity or heritage because I always gravitated to it (my parents didn't force it on me) and I'm a very curious person. Sometimes I'm surprised at how ""confused"" Desis who did grow up with a huge Desi societal network and large family can be, and how little they know sometimes about South Asian cultures, history, and the like.  Bottom line, just do whatever you like. If you want to wear Desi clothes, do it. Doesn't matter what people assume; it's part of who you are. You're not appropriating anything or ""trying to be ethnic""; you have the adopt as little or as much as you like of your parent cultures because they're just as much yours as anybody else's."
ABCDesis,35ynrg,brandysnifter,3,Thu May 14 17:27:49 2015 UTC,Can you speak Armenian or Bengali?
ABCDesis,35ynrg,Shopno,5,Fri May 15 01:46:57 2015 UTC,"Since I didn't grow up with either community surrounding me and my parents only having English in common, not really.  I used to be fluent in Armenian as a child, when my grandmother stayed with us for a bit, but forgot most of it after she left because I didn't use it much except sometimes with my dad. I still understand it a little bit and I'm trying to improve it by reading/speaking/music/media.  I didn't really know much Bengali as a kid until I started teaching myself and paying attention to it more in middle and high school, especially after going to India more frequently in high school and college. There's so much news, media, and music available in Bengali and that has really helped me pick it up. I still don't speak it well, but I can get by with basic things.  Basically I used to speak Armenian and no Bengali, now I speak some Bengali and little Armenian. Sigh, I wish I were fluent in both."

ABCDesis,35ynrg,iheartlucifer,1 point,Sat May 16 01:09:10 2015 UTC,Malaysia is kind of racist. The Chinese dominate the economy but the Malays dominate the government due to a flawed voting system. My Chinese and Indian relatives tend to get along due to their mutual dislike of Malay Nationalists.

They have an extended family setup in Bangalore.  My one aunt was not allowed to be on the phone with a man for any reason as a teen (""Do you want to be the kind of girl who gets on the phone with boys?""). My uncle's wife decided I was up to nefarious boy related mischief because I tried to find the way to another aunt's house by walking.   I've been through all of it -- I was told that I could only go to college within a three hour radius (I had to fight for that), I had the ridiculous curfew, and I was expected to do chores my brother never had to touch. My brother isn't even expected to put food in the fridge after he's done.

How I kept my hands in my pockets so they wouldn't reveal their incessant limp. So when I think about oppression I don't think about language, I think about my body.

I think about the ones I never took. I think about sitting in the bleachers as Becky, Megan, Diana, and Morgan promenaded onto the field with tacky dresses and I think about how everyone cheered for them (including me).  I think about who is allowed to be feminine. I think about who is allowed to be beautiful.  When people ask me if I ever took performance classes I wonder whether growing up as trans counts?  You see: we learn from an early age how to memorize the scripts for both roles in order to get by.  Don't forget: our survival can be the best masterpiece of our artistic career, give us an award for that."

Dark skin in India doesn't have the same connotations as in the US. People don't link skin color to intelligence and behavior. People may think that fair skin is more beautiful but even dark skinned people may be considered beautiful based on other factors.  The really fucked up thing in India is the treatment of lower caste people. It is subdued nowadays but reares it's ugly head every now and then. If you ask me treatment of African American's is more closely linked to treatment of lower caste people rather than treatment of dark skinned people. Lower caste people are treated badly because they are considered impure and lower, African Americans have some negative connotations like being considered prone to crime, violent etc.  P.S. My observations are based on South India. I have no idea what it's like in North India."

I think that we have a duty to make things better, even if it is for ourselves. All of these things you listed are issues that have solutions. It is for us to find them. I assume you are a twentysomething, OP. That means that you have AT LEAST 30 good years ahead of you, fate-willing. Imagine what has been accomplished in 30 years. If all of us youngsters resign ourselves to how the world is failing because of the actions of the previous generations, then we are not better than them. Yes, they left us a shitty world that is getting shittier, but it is up to us to make sure that it doesn't. We have the duty to our older selves. Yes, you don't want to have kids, okay. But what about when you are 70? Do you want to live in the past, saying to yourself, ""I miss the rhinos..."" instead of saying, ""Hmm, I wanna see some rhinos. I'll go book a ticket to Africa.""  Now, don't get me wrong, OP. I get that you don't want children, but your reasoning just seems off. Yes, the world is consumer oriented and materialistic. Yes, there are shitty things going on in the world. But you know what? The world isn't as bad as you see it. Stop being scared. There is no NEED for the top strollers and the latest model of cars. That is all based around fear. Teach yourself to be above that. Realize that it, in order to be a good parent, it is not about giving a child the latest gadget or the latest smart phone. Afraid of your child becoming an ""outcast""? They'll grow out of it. Call me too optimistic or stupid, I don't care. I too have seen the potential and progress of humanity. That is more than enough to convince me of the reality of the world, not some movie with scary pictures and doomsday voiceovers. Simply see the love and respect given to Nepal in the face of TWO earthquakes in close proximation. See our potential of creating things that were barely ideas 25 years ago.  I don't have kids of my own. I have fears everyday about being a dad, and how the world is going to be. However, I have faith that things are going to always get better in the end.

Even if every human on the planet were to magically disappear, it would still take a century or so to reverse CO2 levels to pre-industrial age times. So, there isn't really substantial one person, a group of people, or even an entire underdeveloped country can do to reverse this. This requires global policy changes. Here is something to give you a perspective: it would cost the top firms 2.2 trillion dollars in losses if eco costs were factored in. If you were the CEO of, say, Shell, would you care about clean drinking water in some remote Amazonian jungle or the air quality in Chennai? Probably not.   but it is up to us to make sure that it doesn't.    I read about something called the species-area curve. It explains the diversity of species given the available area. Given that logging and human settlements have rapidly encroached into wilderness, the species are going extinct quicker than you can imagine. In the next 30 years, you could see 25-50% of species gone. Like forever. Remember the conservation of the pandas in the 80s. That's cute.    ""Hmm, I wanna see some rhinos.

Realize that it, in order to be a good parent, it is not about giving a child the latest gadget or the latest smart phone.   I am committed in my cause of remaining child-free. I'd like you to show me examples from your friends who have this mindset of yours, and have intended to consciously deny what is essentially fun to their kids as they grow up. You misunderstand, or have forgotten, peer pressure. You must remember that kids today (and us) live in a hyper-connected universe. Growing up, I had no idea of the happenings of the world outside my classroom. Now, with apps like Snapchat, a kid knows what another kid is doing somewhere else on the planet. That level of connectivity comes with a great information deluge, something that kids are primed from birth. If you deny your child a laptop, you will endanger their academics (at least in the US) because most textbooks and study materials are going online. If you are now buying an electronic gadget for your kindergartner, well, you know how that's going to go.   For every news story about a terrorist attack or murder, I see 4 acts of kindness and humanity.    Again, I believe that you are not informed enough. You are experiencing the same rosy optimism because of blinkered vision. You are equating scenarios that have small scale human cause and effects. terrorism and earthquake relief, while sad and amazing, affect a few, what?, millions (upper end.) What I am talking about will affect all seven billion, and counting, people. Nature doesn't care if you have helped someone with their homework or blew your leg up in an accidental suicide bombing if you live in California. There is still no water. If you live in Mauritius, your country is already half gone to sea level rise. You know who else suffers from climate change? Insurance companies. They have to pay for floods and fires and tornadoes and hurricanes. Here is an article about their thoughts.  You have not been able to see the looming crisis, and its effects on us.

I'm also scared of giving birth. I would say that I might want to get married one day. Desi culture is very hell-bent on breeding though, so there's no choice but to lie about being infertile if you're asked why you don't have kids.I agree with you how having more kids means more resources wasted, and that there are already people on this planet that don't deserve to be parents. I swear, telling people to have kids because they're able to is like telling people who are physically able-bodied they should run a marathon.

I know they're looking forward to being grandparents, but I just...can't. It sucks extra hard because I'm an only child. My concerns are more related to my mental health and (lack of) capacity to care for future kids without completely fucking them (or me) up. Children of depressed parents are at higher risk for all sorts of negative outcomes, including mental and physical health issues. I'm also terrified that I would be that kind of unstable mother who drowns her kids. My parents have come around on the whole ""depression and ADHD don't real"" thing, but I don't know how to talk to them about this. My extended family is still not convinced of the existence of mental illness, and I definitely don't know how to navigate any of this with them."

I moved out of Mumbai right around the same age you are moving back in. I understand your situation, even people who have lived all their life in other parts of India are sometimes scared to move to Mumbai. Its a working class city, hard work is respected above everything else. The best of my friends, the stupidest assholes I have met, the kindest of people in my life are from here. My point is you'll find people, the ones who think like you, the ones who share your interests, the ones who care about the same issues and the ones who DGAF about the same things you DGAF about. There are fewer places as diverse as Mumbai, my group of friends (12 of us) in Mumbai had people culturally native to 8 different states in India. So, while we enjoyed the multiculturalism, the one thing we had in common was love for that stinky godforsaken piece of land. Politics is everywhere in India, as a Mumbaikar you really won't have much time to care about all these things so please join all the 12 million cityfolk there in giving 0 fucks about it. I miss the food, I truly do, Mumbai is the best place for food, I wish I could teleport back there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Goody goody things aside, reality is that the place is over crowded. That means, reduced personal space for you. But of someone is trying to misbehave then be stern about it, there is no need to take shit from anyone. If you are a woman then a certain amount of assertiveness is required to keep the creeps at bay, watch and learn from the other ladies around you, friends will help in this regard.   About other things: nightlife is decent (daylife not so much :P), dating scenario is matured compared to other cities, throw enough money at it and you'll get better internet (or for that matter better anything else). There are plenty of jobs. Although, depending on your career path the competition could be intense. There are so many people that you'll find interest groups for everything, so look out for meetups, music gigs, comedy shows, theater stuff or whatever it is that interests you. AFAIK there is good LGBT support activity in Mumbai, r/mumbai can perhaps help you better in that regard.   All in all, adult life there is like training wheels coming off your bike, so you will need to find your balance by yourself. The place will make you tough, brave and resilient to bullshit. Embrace the city and the city will embrace you back. After all, its Aamchi Mumbai...its our city. :)"

ABCDesis,35vlod,Tipoe,8,Thu May 14 11:13:39 2015 UTC,"Are you going back to Mumbai? You'll be fine. It's the most cosmopolitan city in India and you'll find a lot of progressive people to hang out with. There will be some culture shock for sure, but it could be worse in other parts of India.    Politics   Indian people love politics and you can't avoid talking about it - but that will be about the extent how much it will effect you. Governments will come and go, silly rules will be enacted, never reinforced and eventually repealed but such is life.  Crowds? Well, India is crowded and you need to get used to it.    art    Again, Mumbai being Mumbai you'll have plenty of options with theater and art shows. Mumbai is also a stop for many touring bands (or you can travel to Bangalore).   settling down, looking for jobs, making friends, dating   Yeah that will happen almost automatically. You'll end up as a ""fresher"" and bond with other freshers because companies hire college grads by the dozens every year. That's how I made friends in India and we're still friends after all these years and being all over the globe.   How does one meet people?   Reddit is pretty big there. You'll also find meetup groups, or just networking with colleagues and such.  You'll settle down pretty fast, trust me."

Plus I pretty much spent my formative years here (18-22) where I really learned my interests and character so I wasn't sure how I would be able to continue developing those interests.

It's like riding a bike, you'll get right back into it. I don't know how progressive your family is, so do keep that in mind. In my experience getting back into a family that hasn't seen 2 guys making out in SFO is the biggest problem. Also, mental health issues are poorly understood among the older folks.

Religious intolerance is about as high in America. I've actually had more instances of bigotry here in America than India. As a Muslim, majority of my friends were Hindus and I had no issues with them. Also had Sikh, Jain, and a Parsi friend. People who even leaned slightly towards the Maharasthran nationalism, lol! But never any issues. =)  Creeps definitely stare at you in India, but, not so much in Mumbai. I also don't know where you live within Mumbai and this could have a factor. If you're chilling in Bandra, definitely no where as much as like, let's say in Mahim or something. But people here in general tend to be more educated and open minded. Sexism exists here and I won't deny it. The only thing I can say is that Mumbai is better than any other major city out there in South Asia, imo. :/   Crowds/traffic is a killer and WiFi speeds are getting better but no where as good as parts of the United States. But I highly doubt you need blazing internet speed unless you're playing the latest Call of Duty competitively or something. For all intent and purposes, it works fine. My cousins is always chilling on all the social medias and she doesn't have (m)any issues. Streaming videos and stuff might be an issue, but, not too sure about that. My memory is a bit outdated and I know internet speeds have improved dramatically in many parts of the country.   Making friends in Bombay is easy in my opinion. You can find several social groups in the city or online to meet up. Just hang around all the popular places for youth and you're bound to click. There might be plenty you'll meet who come from similar backgrounds and thinking.   Also wanted to let you know that college is a bubble, even here in America. So, some of these sentiments you share are similar to Americans who move back to their city or small town across the country.   Good luck!"
ABCDesis,35vlod,NotFromMumbai,4,Thu May 14 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"If you're like me, you'll probably hate India for about a week every time you go back after spending a long stint in the US. For the first few days, I've often wondered ""why do I live here again?"" On the surface, there's a lot to dislike about the country (you mentioned several notable ones). But then once you dig under the surface of the city, you'll start to fall in love with it again. For instance, I invariably wonder how I could live without masala dosas, my amazing cook, the breathtaking tropical foliage, seeing my wife in traditional Indian clothing, classic Indian music and dance concerts, etc. Appreciating the country requires letting go of everything one misses in the States and embracing the best of what the country does have to offer. I know that can be hard, though.   It's possible to find everything you're looking for in Mumbai (such as the great group of friends with similar interests)... it just takes digging. Everything in the country seems to require scratching below the chaotic front."

ABCDesis,35uavn,Hot4_TeaCha,10,Wed May 13 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"I studied a bit about this way back when I took a class on the colonial experience. The gist of it was that men were obligated to go out into the world and blend into the lives of the colonists. This meant absorbing their mannerisms, styles of dress, language, cultural norms, and whatever else you needed to do in order to put them at ease and provide for your family. Early on it was depicted as a ""yeah it sucks, but they run the show so you have to play by their rules."" Then over time the western norms and customs themselves become emblematic of being a good provider. Being able to take them on become symbols of being able to function in the ""outside world"" which is the world that runs according to the Westerner's rules.  Meanwhile, the home is retained as an ""inner"" world that needs to be kept safe from the external treats. Since women were considered to be the masters of the home, they then became responsible for carrying on traditions and spirituality.  So as the men are increasingly pressured to reject the old, the women are increasingly pressured to uphold the beleaguered customs and practices that are being short-shrifted by the colonial regime. So they must do their part to preserve them in the face of extinction.   This was as true in India as it was in Japan, pre-cultural revolution China, and various parts of Africa."

ABCDesis,35u812,hotwc,10,Wed May 13 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he doesn't believe it. One of the weird things about smart but unprincipled people is their capacity to convince themselves of whatever belief happens to be convenient for them at the time.  It's like George said to Jerry when he needed to pass a polygraph. ""It's not a lie as long as you believe it.""

Any non-IPA beer by Bell's or Sierra Nevada is always good.  Blue Moon seasonal wheat variations are usually good too.  There a beer I got to taste only once but I am always on the hunt for it. Indeed Brewery's (Minneapolis-based) smoked-jalapeno stout called Hotbox or something. That was serisouly one of a kind and amazing!"
ABCDesis,35uaj8,nosupport,2,Wed May 13 20:00:45 2015 UTC,Blue Moon   Agh! I hope you do realize that BM is owned by Anheisser Bush in the attempt to bolster their dwindling Bud/Lite sales. Their tactics to mask BM as a craft brewery disgust me.
ABCDesis,35uaj8,oinkyy,2,Wed May 13 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"When I say craft, I mean the product itself rather than the holding company. Blue Moon is owned by Anheuser-Busch but their products are not generic, mass-produced stuff. They have a lot of seasonal variation in their offering and take care to make it taste great. I can't tolerate Bud and other generic 'beer' but I don't care if they own other smaller breweries which make great beer.  Personally, as a mechanical engineer who knows a bit about industrial economics, I am often annoyed by the whole ""hand-crafted, artisanal"" craze. Anybody with any knowledge of economics will tell you that true hand-crafted or small-batch products will cost many times over industrially-produced stuff without any noticeable improvement in quality. Most 'artisanal' products are actually factory-made except for the very last part of the supply chain. Most small-batch or craft breweries get their hops and grains from General Mills, and sometimes, directly distillates from large breweries after which they add their own flavours and hops."
ABCDesis,35uaj8,GWmyc2,2,Wed May 13 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"First off, I was wrong. BM is owned by MillerCoors, not AB.  Secondly, I am with you that artisanal products are more expensive. As someone who occasionally brews his own beer, I also know how tedious the process is.  I am not a big fan of most of corporate America. When profits are at stake, everything is fair game. While I don't deny that BM could potentially taste as good as some craft beers, it is not my philosophy to support market bullies.  I find it hard that a big company like Miller could have acquired Blue Moon solely to add a feather to its brewing cap with no other ulterior motives. It did so because regular beers are no longer ""tasty"" and as people discover amazing craft beers, they wonder why their Bud/Miller/Coors taste like, to paraphrase John Oliver, ""like carbonated urine found in the hollow of a log"".  Essentially, but for craft beer, there wouldn't have been a clamor by Big Beer to start acquiring craft breweries. But for craft beers, most beers would be homogenous pale yellow, vaguely urine-like brews (think Duff Beer), and that is because, as you rightly pointed out, making profits involves cutting costs, and in this case, flavor too.  It hurt me to read that Ommegang got bought, and that Cigar City was considering selling out too. But we are going through a nice phase in the US where a great number of craft brews are blooming, and the choices are truly endless."
ABCDesis,35uaj8,nosupport,2,Wed May 13 20:33:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your sentiments. I am not a fan of monopolies or cartels, which would describe most industries in the US. It's definitely good to see that so many independent breweries exist and make profit.   I just think MillerCoors acquired Blue Moon for the same reason Blue Moon brewery was established i.e. to make profit. Acquiring a profit-making enterprise and making it bigger using their humongous supply and distribution chain is an age-old business practice.   ""Urine beers"" still have a place in American beer market, cornering the frat party market but craft beers are definitely making huge waves. I am not supportive of large industries in general but Americans seem to care very little about their existence in general. I would love if people started supporting smaller companies and legislation supporting smaller companies, as opposed to falsely advertised trends like ""artisanal"" or ""hand-crafted""."

In the end, he's friends with all of these people, (as well as a genuinely nice dude) so he gives honest answers. But whenever people cross the line into ethically questionable territory (""Can I see the essays you wrote to get in?"") he just throws a self-deprecating remark to ward them off. (""Oh you wouldn't want to see it"" or ""It's in my recycling bin for a reason"") If that doesn't work, he'll try and deflect the question back to them. (""How about I help you out with yours?"")

Aunty: You have gained quite a bit of weight.  Me: Not really.  I used to be too skinny, I am at a healthy weight now (I weigh 130 lbs btw)  Aunty: No, you look fat and it's dangerous. You will not get pregnant if you are fat.  Me: My Ob-gyn and PCP are both fine with my weight. If I need to lose weight when I plan on getting pregnant I will follow their advice.  Aunty: My third cousin's fourth son's wife was your size and the doctor said that's very unhealthy.  Me: Umm I can't comment on someone I don't know.  Aunty: Have you tried this diet.  Goes on to discuss some crazy fruit based diet.  Me: I am fine thanks.  Aunty: If you don't lose weight your husband will leave you.  Me: Let him go if he wants. I can't keep him hostage if he is repulsed by me.  Aunty: It's not a joke. Men these days expect their wives to be hot.  You need to make sure you can keep your husband.  Me: Yeah sure, I'll keep my husband around so he can beat the living crap out of me.  Aunty: Mumbles something unintelligible.

Now, he just had his 80th birthday and he's definitely older than he used to be, and thinner, but he's still healthy and moving around and all that good stuff.  So this guy visiting asks him, ""have you always looked this old/thin?"" (which, c'mon, who says that) so without skipping a beat and with a straight face, my grandpa asks the guy: ""I don't know, were you always the size of an elephant?""  That shut him right up and the guy never said another word.

I don't mean it in a condescending way, but in a sympathetic one. I remember I used to complain to my parents (who are not this type at all) that I was sick of random uncles and aunties constantly talking to me about random shit and that I had to put a good face on throughout, but they told me that honestly many Desi uncles and aunties that do this spend so much of their early lives working for their parents and their expectations, and so much of their latter lives only working for their kids, that they never actually think about themselves and hardly develop concrete relationships. So this is their [awkward] attempt at socialization. I just try to keep my distance, nod profusely when they give their advice, and completely plug out of what they're saying; it works pretty well for all parties!

I think my favorite one was being called mentally ill because I wasn't talkative as a kid.   I've grown to realize that a lot of them are overcompensate for something lacking in their lives. It's an emotional response and they've just found the wrong way to cope with it.  There's no point in letting their words and actions lead to anger on your end. I may not respect or agree with their words but I do respect myself enough not to devolve onto their level and as a result of expecting the best from myself I hold myself to a much higher standard.

ABCDesis,35pu8r,GWmyc2,5,Tue May 12 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"I've done four years of grad school. What I've noticed is that your classmates are more mature, the professors are more understanding and you're treated more like an adult.   If you get stressed about academics and grades, go talk to your professor/advisor. They've always been willing to accommodate me.   I had a friend in my MBA program who was taking some board exam the same day we had a finance midterm. He talked to the professor beforehand and the guy said ""that's fine - just tell me how much you want your final exam to be worth for your overall grade and I'll shift your midterm exam weight to that.""  They get that you have a life outside of their class. They don't mind working with you to figure things out."

I've been super lucky with supervisors in the past (for my honours project, work, etc.) so I'm really really hoping that streak continues. I've just heard so many horror stories about terrible supervisors that I guess I scared myself a little haha. Thank you for the advice though!

That way, you'll have a better idea of who and which resources to seek out.  Otherwise, relax now. Get exercise, eat well, do your hobbies with abandon, travel. Once you start grad school (I'm assuming it's a Ph.D.?), you'll be working year round, and it's hard to hit the ground running if you're still harried from undergrad.  In grad school itself, what helped a lot was having trusted friends to decompress to. Make sure you're in touch with old friends, and try to make new ones. :)"

There are firms where each project would typically last 5-6 months, so you will transition to a new project by the time you've learnt everything there is to learn on the job.  Also, I share Jack Welch's opinion when it comes to a career- you rarely end up where you expect to be (you'll change roles/industries throughout your life)..   and don't worry about the money, if you're happy and engaged on the job, you will become the Best at what you do -- money and recognition will follow"
ABCDesis,35pu8r,GodModeONE,2,Wed May 13 02:22:21 2015 UTC,"Consulting projects can be shorter. I did 3-4 week projects and 48 hour feasibility projects. Depending on the company you work for, you can have an absolutely wide variety of project themes and topics. You do a project on FMCG, then one on industrial products, then women's fashion, then entertainment business. It helps you understand different industries and probably know where you see yourself in in the future.  I second consulting for /u/feetintheair12 - not only because of getting burned/burned out, but because it is a great stepping stone for future management roles, and more importantly, it teaches you the important of hard work (hello 70 hour weeks!)."

I wish I had gotten married at 23ish to a supportive family man (who wouldn't be cheap about giving me spending money), and then I would have his kids in my 20s and put my maximum time and energy with them. In exchange for my husband supporting me with my dream, I would make his life perfect and comfortable. I'd make him awesome dinners, have cute freshly washed kids at home, help with all his goals, and be young pretty and energetic. I wouldn't whine about every little thing. Then by 30 I could focus fully on career and kids would be in school. But I'm 30 now...heh...now I wish I could do a master's and improve myself, but then I have to worry that this is my last decade of fertility :( Taking off five years to stay home with kids in the middle of a career is really a career-killer too. I so think it is better to have marriage and kids young! That way you can do both homemaking and career at 100%.

I don't think it will be possible but I'd be interested in finding a way to take significant time off of work when my children are young. Like 50% of the working week off or something. Unfortunately, the years during which your children are young are also the years where you can make the most amount of progress in your career. Realistically, this probably means that I'm either a) not going to have kids, or b) I'm going to find a way to push having kids until later in life."

My wife was on a very fast executive career track, but was more or less capped in her career with her present employer. We were dating for a short while and I told her that she should consider going back to school to propel her career even further.  Living in Chicago, we have two really good business schools and the world would have been her oyster.    She told me she didn't want to work forever.  and I hate to say it like this, but that point not only stuck around for me, but made me love her even more.  She wanted to raise a family and didn't want to go to school, put her career on hold while obtaining her MBA and return to work for a few years before becoming a full-time mom.  I've come across a ton of people that go to school to make others happy (ahem), but that's not what they really want to do.   I loved her at that point because I knew that if we got married, her unpaid student loans would become MY unpaid student loans.  Her income being put on hold, would become MY income being put on hold.    So a bunch of years later, we got married and a few years after that we had kids.  It really wasn't even discussed that she'd stay at home.  We never talked about it because it was set so early on.  I knew she wanted to raise our son, and she did as well.  We now have two boys and I'm really not sure if/when she will return back to work fulltime.    I've met plenty of parents that shouldn't be parents.  They really do suck at parenting.  Day care and child care is the single best thing for their kids.  I've also met plenty of parents that work because they have to do it.  They simply can't make ends meet otherwise.  To those, I have to question the decisions that were made early on - like in my wife's case if she went back to business school and took on ~$70-100k in debt.    So anyway, just something to think about as you're dating.  Who do you want to raise your kids?  I didn't want somebody making $8-12/hour raising my kid."

ABCDesis,35m653,serenissima_regina,1 point,Tue May 12 04:26:08 2015 UTC,How many daycare workers have you spoken to?
ABCDesis,35m653,hdpq,3,Tue May 12 11:05:42 2015 UTC,"How many daycare workers have you spoken to?   I actually have spoken to a lot of nannies and daycare workers, because I'm pretty much the only childless one of my friends, and because I've worked on and off as a high-end tutor since I was 18.  First, the people on the ""executive track,"" as you put it, can afford to be very selective about nannies. Because the education and psychology fields are paid so poorly in the US, it's competitive to hire experienced teachers as full-time salaried childcare. If your salary is $1m, you can easily hire a literature Ph.D. ex-teacher for $80k to care for your children, and have pots of money left over. (What one of my finance friends is doing right now.)  But even apart from the high end of childcare, the $8/h people you speak so scathingly of have, in my experience, been gentle, patient, loving people, who happen to be poor. A lot of them are mothers themselves, and have a lot of experience with children, people and life. They are able to impart lessons about character and resilience and respect for the humble.  It's important to realize that childcare people usually don't ""raise your children."" In general, even with $80k nannies and parents in finance, the parents (usually mothers) do more than half the actual childcare. Most of my friends with nannies work reduced hours or work from home part of the time. To a large extent, nannies do the busywork of parenting - laundry, grocery, food prep, shuttling children to activities, etc. (My software executive friend works from home except for when there are meetings. On a typical she does a combination or watching the child and working, and the nanny does household tasks and picks up the slack during meetings.)  Which isn't to say that you and your wife have made a bad decision. But to make assumptions about working mothers abandoning children, and assumptions about the character of poorer people, is wildly unfair."
ABCDesis,35m653,serenissima_regina,-1,Tue May 12 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"Your assumptions are about as redic as mine were. You are assuming that a literature PhD ex-teacher is willing to be a personal nanny.  Plus, while my wife was on a fast-track career path, I don't think she was anywhere near on a track to earn $1m a year.  High $300-400k, very possible, but $1m is likely not possible.  But, whatever.  Your point is taken.  Thanks."
ABCDesis,35m653,hdpq,3,Tue May 12 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"You are assuming that a literature PhD ex-teacher is willing to be a personal nanny.   As I mentioned, that's literally someone one of my friends hired. And she's no anomaly. Because the humanities have few career prospects, and because teaching pays poorly, there are many takers.   $40-$100k + benefits for a fairly pleasant job is something a lot of educated people would jump at, and these jobs are quite competitive for people with masters degrees (and yes, sometimes Ph.D.s). Life is tough if you're a freelance writer or artist or musician, or you're getting started in psychology. The ""trick"" to getting responsible, experienced and educated people to be a nanny is to offer a fixed contract (after a trial period), and to use references and agencies.  Sure, you get have to wade through random people if you advertise on craigslist for $10/h. But practically, what serious parents do is hire someone vetted through an agency or a friend, and get a professional to draw up a proper employment contract. So, when we have children we'd work with someone one of our friends worked with, such as the literature Ph.D. Or find someone through one of the agencies I know about through tutoring."

ABCDesis,35lqyf,frackaracka,3,Mon May 11 21:31:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, Robert said plainly that he won it by conquest. Renly wanted to rule because he thought he would be better than Stannis but eventually concedes to the point that a name means nothing if you can win it by force. Stannis believes it his right to rule because Tommen is born of incest and not legitimate. He even says in the books that he never took his proof to Robert because it would look like he is just trying to take the crown for himself. Dany, on the other hand, feels that her name entitles her to the Iron Throne as did her brother (but he is dead so no point mentioning him)."
ABCDesis,35lqyf,frackaracka,2,Mon May 11 22:36:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but couldn't you argue that Stannis thinks it's his right to rule because of his name too? As in the next-in-line legitimate Baratheon.
ABCDesis,35lqyf,frackaracka,2,Mon May 11 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"No. Stannis thinks it his right to rule because of the law. He actually spent a few days debating if he should help Robert out in his rebellion or side with the lawful king despite him being known as the Mad King and ordering his older brother dead. When Davos once asked him why did he want to be king when he never really seemed interested in it Stannis said this, ""It is not a question of wanting. The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. That is law. After me, it must pass to my daughter, unless Selyse should finally give me a son. I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother."""

The Targaryen dynasty lost their claim to the throne by right of conquest. It is the same as the War of Spanish Succession. There were Hapsburgs who could have taken the Spanish throne, but the Bourbons eventually won it and now are the Spanish monarchs. The Hapsburg house still continues to this day. They can say they have a claim, but that doesn't mean anything unless you can enforce it. For now the Bourbons have the throne and by law the Bourbons are the only ones that have the right to the Spanish crown.  Also, I think you missed the point of my initial post. I singled Dany out because unlike Stannis who doesn't have a family history of craziness, Dany does. She will take her dragons, start a war and kill tons of people because she believes the throne is hers and then in the end turn out to be as crazy as her father. She isn't a good ruler yet she still won the throne."

ABCDesis,35lqyf,ShereOnFire,1 point,Tue May 12 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"Kind of. Feudal conceptions of legitimacy were a little fuzzy. Kings ruled by divine right and had certain expectations on them to protect the realm and their vassals. If the world starts going to shit, it would be said that the king has displeased God somehow and lost that divine right.  Kings who refused to deal with their vassals justly, as with Aerys burning the Starks alive and having his son kidnap their daughter, would have been considered a grievous breach of how the customary relationship is supposed to work.  History ends up written by the winners, but when things like Robert' Rebellion happens the story ends up being that the old dynasty lost its claim to divine right by failing to uphold that implicit contract between ruler and ruled."

Like when I am faced with racism, I make a decision whether these people are important in my life or not.   They are important if they are close friends (who sometimes say unexpected things but are still great to me), people at work who can affect my career etc. I try not to rock the boat and let it go with the expectation that they still consider me, the person, as someone they like and respect. I then go out and vent by talking to myself or wearing myself out through physical exercise (that really helps!).  If they are people in an online forum where I spend considerable time but whose moderators I know to be racist, I make sure to give them a piece of my mind every time they say something on those lines. I make sure that I comply with their rules but despite that, I have been temporarily banned at least once and prevented from commenting on certain issues.  As a man, I haven't dealt with sexism so I don't know what are some things that will feel different from racism.

Sometimes, if they're a friend or someone I know better than an acquaintance, I'll try to gently ask why they said what they did, where that thought comes from. Sometimes that works, and they don't say those things again. Sometimes it results in me being condescended to.   Sometimes I just try to brush it off or ignore it. And then I rant on my tumblr or to my friends. There's not a good strategy for dealing with day to day acts of sexism or racism. In my life, I try to view people as if they're coming from their best place, like they're just trying to live their lives the best they can. That perspective helps me recognize that the sexism or racism they're expressing is because of how culturally ingrained those attitudes are, not because they're necessarily bad people.

They're going to be shocked. This is just making average Muslims look radical. Changing a group to fit the majority's range of acceptableness (I'm just making up words now, huh) just makes things worse. That's not preaching acceptance or tolerance it's just encouraging ignorance.  Edit: Also the fact that they've got dirty laundry and they're waving it proudly.

These are all regarded as sins, but if you repent sincerely, you can be forgiven. Only God has the ability to dictate who is and out of Islam. Unless they clearly express and believe that they want to be out of Islam. That's a different story.   I'm not a fan of people trying to portray themselves as Westernized just cause they partake in some indulges. I think it's much more admirable when people are steadfast to their devotion. Even better when they keep it to themselves. I honestly don't care if a fellow Muslim drinks and parties but won't touch bacon and will fast all 30 days of Ramazan. I am no one to say what he or she should or shouldn't do.   Also, I like how /r/exmuslim is one of the linked subs for religion on this sub, lol! It's intriguing.

Would you also consider Lucknawi Nawabs, Hyderabadi Mirzas and Mughal shahenshahs non-Muslim? By certain interpretations, Sufis can also be categorised as non-Muslim and yet, large parts of the subcontinent converted to Islam because of Sufi influence.   People make accommodations all the time when believing in any religion. I don't believe some people deserve to never be educated just because they were born in the wrong caste, even though I call myself a Hindu. Most Christians don't believe in slavery anymore even though the Bible approves of it. In fact, anti-slavery organizations in the US had a large Christian support base. Similarly, most Muslims don't believe in taking enemy women as slaves even though the Quran approves of it and plenty of Muslims kill other Muslims even though it's not the right thing to do according to Islam."
ABCDesis,35i4pa,akbar-great_chai-tea,6,Sun May 10 22:43:15 2015 UTC,"That is a weak argument. Rarely does the morals of the elite/royalty reflect upon that of the people's. The elite can have people killed for criticizing them, and the mughals were no exception.  Akbar in fact invented his own religion, would you say he was a muslim? Aurangzeb was a devout muslim who led a modest life akin to that of his subjects. He did not even have enough to pay for his burial shroud when he died."
ABCDesis,35i4pa,YouHaveTakenItTooFar,10,Sun May 10 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"So you really believe that most Nawabs and Emperors of India were not Muslims? You are free to believe that but given that they considered themselves Muslims, it's just your opinion.  Akbar declared that he was not Muslim anymore when he invented his own religion but other emperors and nawabs didn't.   Aurangzeb is among the few examples among royalty of the kind of Muslims you speak of and I don't know why anyone would want to associate the image of a ""good Muslim"" with him. Other than strictly interpreting the Quran, he has very few good deeds to his name."
ABCDesis,35i4pa,akbar-great_chai-tea,3,Mon May 11 00:26:48 2015 UTC,Your second point is invalid because casteism is not a tenet of Hinduism or a marker of faith. You're misrepresenting facts to suit your argument.

For Muslims who live in America and grew up in the religion, they still might have affection for or a desire to be linked with the community, especially in light of the narrative of our era being the polarization and antagonism of Western and Islamic values.  You might be right that Muslims should never drink alcohol and when a Muslim makes the conscious decision to touch his lips to the bottle he relinquishes his right to self-identify as a Muslim. Personally, I think that view is bullshit. I don't think it's black or white. Not today, not in America, and not even throughout the history of Islam. In my view, thinking in terms of monolithic categories is exactly what ISIS does. It's what Fox News does. It's not what liberal, progressive people do."

Might as well open a tumblr.   You might be right that Muslims should never drink alcohol and when a Muslim makes the conscious decision to touch his lips to the bottle he relinquishes his right to self-identify as a Muslim   You are projecting, i don't believe this. Muslims commit vice all the time, it does not disqualify them from being muslims. But in this girls case, when she openly describes herself as a muslim who casually breaks all of the most well known characteristics of being a muslim, its obvious she's doing this for the show. Its like going to a play and confusing the actor for his character.  Show me one instance throughout islamic society and cultures where 'pork-eating, alcohol-drinking, premarital-sex-having Muslims' were the norm   I don't think it's black or white.   I don't believe in black and white. I also don't believe everything is an opaque grey. That frankly, is bullshit. Islam is not a buffet line, you don't get to pick and choose when it comes to clear cut instructions and pretend it doesn't make you a hypocrite.

I'm picturing a brown girl giddily rolling around in a massive pile of sausage and bacon. Pretty funny imagery.   This hyper individualism and abdication of responsibility is just as morally bankrupt as the fanaticism of the extremists.   Really? A person who eats pork, drinks alcohol, has non-marital sex and still claims to be a Muslim IS AS ""MORALLY BANKRUPT"" as a person who, for example, murdered innocent schoolchildren in Peshawar or beheaded non-Muslims under the ISIS banner? A bit hyperbolic there, I think.   I'm trying to understand the point beneath the hyperbole. Something about tumblr and hipsters and attention-seeking on par with fanaticism.   Show me one instance throughout islamic society and cultures where 'pork-eating, alcohol-drinking, premarital-sex-having Muslims' were the norm   I obviously can't. 'Norm' implies that the majority of Muslims in that society were partaking in those activities, which I agree has never been the case.  You have your opinion and I have mine. I don't get bogged down by rules and traditions and exclusivity. The word Islam means submission to God. It doesn't mean submission to tradition and judgment. As far as I'm concerned, that submission, that islam, is the qualifying factor. I believe in Islam as a spiritual force that can touch anyone, whether they consider themselves Muslim or not. The Dalai Lama is a Muslim. Jesus is a Muslim who turned water to wine. Would the majority of Muslims agree with me? No. But I think a lot of Muslims are too busy worrying about whether they left their house with their right foot first to really get with it."

An extremist might be anyone who believes that Muslims should wage ""Jihad"" against non-Muslims, believes women should not be educated and should be covered head to toe, and/or ""Deviant Muslims"" should be executed. However, they may never have engaged in any of those activities and simply hold the beliefs themselves. I mean, there could be/are extremists who find the beheadings by ISIS to be reprehensible.

You are in downtown Chicago... almost everything is close by (Except indian products).  Dating scene - no idea since my age group's significantly older.  Lots of indian restaurants close to SAIC campus. Indian products are on Devon (freaking long train ride + a bus ride away.. 1hr one way) Huge desi population. Downtown mostly has young professionals and a small student body. IIT, UIC, UChicago & NW are the 4 major campuses here. Most of the desi uncle/aunty population live in Naperville and Schaumburg (two suburbs around 40 mins from downtown).    Finally - it is summer and you maybe able to land some winter clothes inexpensively right now. Winters are really horrid here - and you want the best.   Chicago gets cold around early September and stays that way until April-May. (Today was 49F). It snows from Oct to March usually. So please invest into some good winter clothing. In Jan, temperatures commonly are -10F to -30F.   e.g: Get a knee length down coat (something like http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/42359?page=ultrawarm-coat-long).

I would suggest some good parka - e.g. http://www.landsend.com/products/mens-expedition-parka/id_273541  Make sure you get good boots too. These are considered the best for nasty winters like chicagos (and for people who will be doing walking.. rather than sitting in a car!). They are not the best looking, but people swear by them.  http://www.sorel.com/mens-caribou-boot-NM1000.html   Finally gloves. Find the warmest gloves you can find in Northface or REI etc. I love this company - http://www.canada-goose.com/down-gloves-5151M.html#start=1 ( I love this company in general)  Try to think of them as 4-5 yr investments, rather than a single winter investment."

Advice:   Bring warm clothes, and dress in layers during the winter! No one's judging because they're too busy trying to stay warm themselves, haha. Sports games are generally pretty expensive, but the cheapest way to catch a good game is at Northwestern. Solid Big Ten football even though it's mostly in losing efforts :S Desi community is pretty strong, and there are numerous religious institutions to get involved with. One really cool one is the Baha'i Temple that's a straight shot up the Red/Purple Line.  It was mentioned below, but Devon Street is definitely the hub for the older Chicago Indian community. There are some Indian stores in the suburbs (including Schaumburg and Naperville) but it'll be a trek for you coming from the Loop. Dating scene is pretty laid back, in my opinion. Tinder is definitely the interface of choice for most of my friends, but there are other spaces for relationships."

She would convince me to use those facial skin lighteners. I was in middle school at the time. I love my skin color though, and fuck lightning creams.

ABCDesis,35ghkd,Master_AK,7,Sun May 10 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"I think the Bollywood effect is very real. I had two close friends while at university - one was quite short and fair and the other was tall but very dark (he also had a shaved head so he looked black sometimes), they were both reasonably good looking. All the Indian girls were gushing over the shorter fair guy and practically ignored the darker one, but girls of every other race preferred the darker guy and he was very successful with non Indian women. It just so happens that most Bollywood male actors are short, fair and cute looking (not really masculine - the Khans especially)."

I think it is probably because baldness is better accepted in Hollywood with the likes of Jason Statham and Vin Diesel than in Bollywood. I can't think of any bald Bollywood ators who haven't gotten a transplant."
ABCDesis,35ghkd,frackaracka,3,Sun May 10 15:31:11 2015 UTC,You need a masculine face with a strong jawline to pull off the bald look (or a beard to hide that you don't - Jason Statham doesn't need a beard but someone with a less manly face would). I know quite a few desi guys that pull off the bearded/bald look really well (they were previously balding/babyfaced) - it looks great when you are relatively muscular too.

ABCDesis,35ghkd,NJMD,6,Sun May 10 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly guys, and maybe this is because I'm older (not necessarily ""wiser"" but still): when you meet the right person, they will not only not care about your skin color but absolutely adore you for it.  After all it's you, and they love you.    The problem is you're scared.  You don't trust that you could ever meet someone who'll love you that much.  Because you don't love yourself that much, so how could anyone else right?  Well start loving yourself for all the things that you are, and I guarantee you that others will start doing the same.  That amazing love that you're dying to have?  It starts with you.  OP, in spirit I agree with you when you say:   I always believe that there is someone out there for everyone. Maybe it's the result of too many Bollywood movies, but I wholeheartedly believe that your perfect guy/girl is waiting for you.   The trick is to understand what ""perfect"" means.  A whole thread could be done on that, but TL;DR: ""perfect"" is not what your head says is perfect (lists of qualities, salary requirements, physical features, etc.) but what your heart says is perfect when you meet that person.  It's not at all something you can predict, plan for, or in any way strategize around.  It happens when it happens, with whomever it happens.  The only question is how flexible you are to follow your heart and not your head in that moment, because often the ""perfect"" person was nothing like your planned ""perfect partner.""    Oh and one more key point: meeting your perfect partner may not necessarily lead to marriage.  That's the Hollywood/Bollywood spin based on fear of loss the need to possess something ""forever"" (which can't be done with anything or anyone).  It'll be whatever that relationship was meant to be, but it will be wonderful and full of real love.  Even just few months of that is worth more than decades with someone not right for you."
ABCDesis,35ghkd,IndianAmericanteen,2,Sun May 10 12:53:56 2015 UTC,"Seriously I think this an Northern Hemisphere issue. I have never in my life heard guys or girls complain that the person is to dark for them. I have met some Pakistanis and they were kinda fixated on skin colour but for me it was isolated to that particular group  that was really desi I mean they only hung out with other desis and spoke a combination of Urdu/Punjabi and English.   Love yourself first and accept who you are and you will find someone for you. Plus go with what you can pull off as well. For example I'm pulling off the man bun with a beard. I look like a brown viking lol. No seriously though it helps to follow current fashion and to stay sharp. I've said it before on this sub and I'll say it again, if someone rejects you because you're to dark then clearly your better off without them in your life."
ABCDesis,35ghkd,LotusEyes92,3,Sun May 10 23:47:10 2015 UTC,"I have a different issue with getting darker - I don't like getting darker than I was last month (my base skin color) because past a certain shade it becomes incredibly difficult to find foundation/BB cream/concealer that matches. I am currently past that shade and it sucks. i have no doubt that I will find someone to get married to, as it is only Indians who have told me I'm too dark and I am luckily allowed to marry outside of my community.  Different type of problem, same root cause. I wonder if we will be able to manually adjust the level of melanin in our skin someday. I wouldn't because I like the color of my skin when it is a little darker than usual but it would be quite interesting."

ABCDesis,35fp6b,destinys_parent,6,Sun May 10 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I can see how that would be a problem, and that is definitely something i do not agree with. my uncle is so obsessed with being fair that he avoids sunlight to the fullest and as a result, is deficient in vitamin d and has frequent fractures from just walking around or bumping into something. perpetuating this ideal can be harmful to one's physical health, in addition to mental well-being. I see the latter mentioned more often but i think it's important to discuss both.  But anyway, if that's it i still don't get why so many people hate her this hard while not being as angry with the companies and other players in this whole skin whitening thing.

ABCDesis,35fp6b,sufimalang,3,Sun May 10 18:04:08 2015 UTC,Let's atleast watch the show before making that harsh a judgement. Lots of Indians have names or surnames that  have very 'non-Indian' origins.

This is much different from the general trend of Asian Americans adopting anglicized first names.   Note that, there are quite a few Desis whose parents immigrated from Kerala. A majority of them are Christians and have names like Kevin, Tom, John, James, etc.   But the examples you gave are different. My best guess is that, they had to give them westernized names so as to not alienate them from the audience."

Taken from the Mindy Lahiri wiki:   Kaling has said she has never been called Vera, her first name,[15] but has been referred to as Mindy since her mother was pregnant with her while her parents were living in Nigeria. They were already planning to move to the United States and wanted, Kaling said, a ""cute American name"" for their daughter, and liked the name Mindy from the TV show Mork & Mindy. The name Vera is, according to Kaling, the name of the ""incarnation of a Hindu goddess.""[15]   Honestly, Vera is a better name than Mindy anyway...  Names that can be seen as both western/indian (and short enough for white people to pronounce) are also very in fashion at the moment - Rhea/Ria, Anya/Aanya, Amy/Ami, Sia (variation of Sita).

Last few years, I have started buying these handspun, hand-dyed shirts from Hyderabad from a store called daram (means thread in Telugu). And this time, stopped at Fab India, and picked up some linen pants. Also, shopped at Raymonds, and got a Made To Measure linen shirt stitched (Jet Airways misplaced my luggage and paid for the shirt essentially!)  All in all, I have been wearing a lot more tailored Indian clothes of late. Coupled with the new groomed beard and the manbun at the right perch, my mom has disowned me."

ABCDesis,35b8y6,plopple,6,Fri May 8 19:05:50 2015 UTC,can you elaborate why? I am soo confused about UK politics. (except for that UKIP are a bunch of tossers :))
ABCDesis,35b8y6,Megalon1,6,Fri May 8 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Well although UKIP has a lot of xenophobic supporters and most likely some racist people standing for election, they won about 3,000,000 votes across the country, third highest number of votes, but only won one seat.   On the other hand, the Scottish Nationalist Party won about 50 seats with far fewer votes. Of course, it means that only one constituency liked UKIP the most but you can certainly appreciate why people feel that the system is broken.   Also, a lot of Labour voters were very averse to the idea of another Conservative government. I am very happy with the result but there are many unhappy Labour supporters today."
ABCDesis,35b8y6,megamouth2,2,Fri May 8 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you very much.   Too many abbreviations in every report I found online. I am also surprised at the coverage the election received in India. The Hindu had a dedicated online section!"
ABCDesis,35b8y6,dancesontrains,10,Sat May 9 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for a continuation of the Con-LD coalition and tactically voted for the Conservatives. Disappointed by the result in the end and especially disappointed to see the Lib Dems wiped out, (in particular seeing the overwhelming majority of Orange Bookers lose their seats). Without the Lib Dems to curtail some of the more draconian cuts I expect the next five years to be very tough on a lot of people.    This result has some hugely important consequences; the West Lothian question will finally be answered, the EU referendum, the Lib Dems are in serious trouble both politically and financially, New Labour is likely to be revived (they should be looking to set up Dan Jarvis for 2020), UKIP are now England's third party and the Tories will finally be able to vote through boundary changes."
ABCDesis,35b8y6,book-of-kells,3,Fri May 8 19:26:31 2015 UTC,I think another Con-Dem coalition would have been ideal but I am happy with the result since I am a Tory supporter.   I am very concerned about the strength of the parties on the extremes of both wings however. It is unprecedented what happened in Scotland but also goes to show the rashness and misinformation passed around during the campaign.
ABCDesis,35b8y6,Tipoe,14,Fri May 8 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"As a Liberal Democrat, I feel crushed, numb, and heartbroken. Charles Kennedy, Simon Hughes, Vince Cable - all voices that were able to reassure and steady the ship even through the roughest of storms, all losing their seats. All well-valued and highly regarded members of parliament who were admired even from across political lines.  And, let's not forget, Nick Clegg. I almost had tears in my eyes as I heard his resignation speech. This is a man who had the courage to steer the Liberal Democrats into a coalition with the Tories, despite knowing the adversity that would come his way. A man whose guidance and decision-making allowed the Liberal Democrats to be a powerful voice in government over the past five years, and a useful balance to David Cameron and the Conservative Party.  I don't really understand how many of our seats were gained by the Tories. Why people would attack the Liberal Democrats for 'enabling' the Tory Party before voting for them to have a majority of their own.  But, as they say, the only way is up. Over the net 5 years, we may see how the Tories will govern without a more centrist/centre-left influence balancing them out. The public will learn that the Liberal Democrats were a true asset in government. We've already seen Theresa May resume work on the Snooper's Charter, that the Liberal Democrats fought against as a result of its impact on civil liberties.   The task now is to reform, rebuild, and restart. We still retain strong, guiding voices in the form of Lord Ashdown, and Baroness Brinton, and have the potential to elect a motivated party leader in Tim Farron. Only time will tell where the Liberal Democrats end up."
ABCDesis,35b8y6,book-of-kells,1 point,Fri May 8 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"The sheer size of the Lib Dems drop is really worrying. They just never recovered after the raising of the tuition fees. I think it is a shame, particularly because nationalist parties won many more votes that the liberals which is a very dangerous area to go down.   I think you're right. It will take probably until the second election after this for people to have forgotten about tuition fees but their policies are too level headed and agreeable for them to not be able to bounce back from this."

ABCDesis,35b8y6,jhschmidt007,4,Sat May 9 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well from my perspective as a Brit in England, the nationalism is a divisive force. Feelings of independence are being stoked by the SNP and I don't think it will end well for the Union. Fair enough to the Scottish people if they want to leave, but at the moment they are benefitting disproportionately from being a part of the United Kingdom. For example, the Barnett formula which ensures they get a non-proportional share of public funds from London.  So they are able to enact policies like no tuition fees for Scottish students, because of English money."

If her story isn't desi-centric, that's fine - it's her story. I'm really not a huge fan of requiring brown people to be sufficiently brown or else.  This is something that irritates me time and again, when I see how people treat my white immigrant fiance, and how they treat me.  Because he's white, he doesn't ever get questioned on his level of assimilation, or are there any questions on whether he's Flemish enough. (And yes, Flemish people are a minority, speaking a slowly dying language, but still no one guilts him.) He gets to just be, and there's no right or wrong answers.  Whereas I was born here (US), lived here my whole life, but still I have to worry about assimilation, and still have to worry about representing Bangladeshis and Bangladeshi-Americans. What's dismaying is that it's not only from the outside, but even more vicious from within my ethnic group. There's no just being."

I also think it's unrealistic to feature desi characters and pretend they are raceless, or that their culture/background has no influence on who they are. White characters in the media are seen as the default, their white-ness is invisible, and any of the influence their white-ness has on their character goes unacknowledged.  I want there to be more media where any character can be a person of color, but their brown-ness isn't the basis of their personality. They're just brown and that's that, without constantly exotifying anything that goes against the dominant culture. I want to watch a show or read a book where the characters practice Ramadan or talk about getting married with their mums without presenting it like it's something unusual. It would just be there, like white characters celebrating Christmas and sharing drinks with their coworkers."

I actually don't think south asian people are represented in the UK as well as they could be, despite the fact that we make up a large chunk of the population.  I don't think it's ever been a matter of numbers for either the US or UK though. It's not like if the number of asian people increased, we would get better media representation. There's plenty of black people in the US and the media is still so skewed against them in favor of serving the white audience's attention."

I don't think you are supposed to shine a light on your ethnic background, but when you are one of the biggest breakthroughs for your ethnicity, people hold you to a higher standard. Whether that is right or wrong is a different issue. A good portion of the sub has expressed only having white friends or white SO (myself included), so her dating and social life isn't my issue. My issue with her is that I find her voice grating, that was why I never watched it. I did like her character in The Office though.   I would like to be clear and say I have never watched the show and my assumptions are from what I have heard about the show. That being said, what I have a problem with is the fact that she never seems to address being Indian in any way in her show. In The Office it was casually mentioned sometimes, but never a big deal. It makes it feel like those desi people you meet who purposefully ignore you and are dicks to you just to prove that they aren't all about being desi. She shouldn't have to bear the cross of constantly reminding us that she is Indian and have tons of other brown people on the show because she owes it to us/them, but it also feels weird that it felt so neglected."

They did only because his gf was 30 and apparently that's ancient in her culture (Mexican) to be having kids. Both of them are unemployed (he is still in college and she is undocumented and can't find work) and on welfare. The kid is growing up in a disgusting apartment in an inner-city ghetto.  The only surprising thing in all of this was his parents' reaction.  He is a recent immigrant and his parents live in India, but they were supportive of the baby and offered to take the baby for 1-2 years while the couple got their shit together.

ABCDesis,35a3v1,serenissima_regina,3,Sat May 9 03:39:46 2015 UTC,I agree - from everything I've read it seems like risks are fairly small. Lots of women only have kids when they're in their 30s.

ABCDesis,35a3v1,iheartlucifer,2,Sat May 9 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"Well, medically speaking, she would be fine having children after 30, assuming she doesn't have serious medical conditions.  Of course, she might have other personal reasons, which of course you should respect."
ABCDesis,35a3v1,serenissima_regina,0,Sat May 9 21:22:30 2015 UTC,Where are you getting this from?   From some OB/GYN friends.
ABCDesis,35a3v1,badmintonnewbie,2,Sat May 9 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"I'm very surprised, because many studies indicate the risks in late pregnancy tend to begin after 35 and even then they are fairly small until 40."
ABCDesis,35a3v1,serenissima_regina,0,Sat May 9 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Well based on what I've been told, this is for the first pregnancy, later pregnancies are usually safe up to around 40."
ABCDesis,35a3v1,badmintonnewbie,2,Sat May 9 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"That's simply not true! For the first pregnancy, the age where people begin to worry is 35.  More importantly, the word ""safe"" is a misonomer - a pregnancy is likely to be ""safe"" at any age. At older maternal ages, a number of unlikely events become more likely, but they are still objectively unlikely.  For example, you have a 0.4% chance to have a child with Down's syndrome at 25 and 1% chance to have a child with Down's syndrome at 35, but in both cases you have a 99% chance of not having a child with Down's syndrome."

The reaction seems very split by generation - my parents' generation are happy for the pregnancy but distressed by the lack of ring, while my generation are pretty much, ""Yay, baby!"" and DGAF about anything else.

ABCDesis,35a3v1,driftercod,5,Fri May 8 12:24:59 2015 UTC,"This would probably be my parents' reaction as well - happy that I'm pregnant but downright worried that I'm not married if that ever was the case (not at my age of 20 though, they'd freak out)  It's always hardest for the first one who fights societal norms, especially when you have relatives that are so extremely judgmental about it but are the very first ones to jump on the wagon of support only when they or their children want to do it"

She spent months not telling anyone until the 5th month of her pregnancy, when she told her parents that she was pregnant and getting married in a month. Her family completely pretended she wasn't pregnant the whole wedding, her parents were pissed. It made me really sad because I felt like obligation to tradition (did I mention they're Brahmins?) prevented them from celebrating the new life her and her husband were about to bring into the world. Even after the baby was born, there were no pictures until a few months later so it wouldn't look like she was pregnant before she got married."

ABCDesis,35aq9z,mntlhlththrwwy,7,Fri May 8 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"I had a pretty rough time in high school. My parents would go to India for months at a time, separately and once or twice, together. When I was 14, they were both gone for about 2-3 months, and my grandmother and an aunt stayed with me. There was also an older couple who also stayed with us. The man in that couple sexually harassed me during their stay, but I never told anyone. I was very depressed and probably had a bit of an eating disorder. I think I just kept myself busy with school and other activities so I didn't have to think about it too much. I was very angry at them, but I never verbalized to them why. I think they probably thought it was just teenage angst.   The summer after my first year of college, I had appendicitis, but before we went to the hospital, my dad thought I was exaggerating the pain. I basically told him I was going to the ER even if I had to drive myself. He grudgingly drove me to the hospital, but on the drive, while I was crying, he basically said I wasn't his daughter for behaving the way I was. Afterwards, when I got back home, he bought me a tub of ice cream as apology, but I'm still haunted by his distrust. I spent that summer trying to tell them so many things, but they just brushed it all off as angst. After that summer, I basically made a vow to myself never to stay more than a couple weeks with them. I saw a counselor through my school, but I never told them about that.   Mental illness is heavily stigmatized, and feelings are brushed off in my family. My relationship is much better with them now, but mostly because of distance. I think I've really made an effort to understand them, but I think they really struggle to do the same for me."
ABCDesis,35aq9z,mayfly42,7,Sat May 9 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"My parents had very different strategies for my brother and I throughout our lives.   I was bullied a lot when I was young and I actually never really opened up to my parents about it. I maybe told my mom once or twice and she did the standard ""just ignore them"". I felt isolated a lot because of things beyond my control that I attributed to my mother that she just didn't understand: clothes, makeup (lack of), puberty (god that was a nightmare), just hanging out with friends, etc. I never felt like I could talk about it because I didn't know how to tell her some stuff she did/made me do were things that made me the ""weird kid"". This all normalized a bit (we are still trying to understand the meaning of the word ""boundaries"") once I got into my senior year of high school/starting college. My parents were both very tough on me school wise, so my biggest ""failures"" were the usual getting a B on a test. In college, they didn't really care what I did as long as I got into med school (when I stressed about not getting in, they were still very understandind and supportive).  Opposite with my brother: he socialized way more in high school so he didnt feel isolated until college. My parents just assumed he'd do the same thing I did to get a sweet scholarship and were less enthusiastic about being hard asses on academics. He didn't get as great of a scholarship but still did pretty good. Ended up doing engineering and got a hard courseload (almost lost a scholarship) which in turn caused my parents to be super hard on him.   I discuss very few things with my dad (mostly stick to career advice which once I realized his advice was from old internist doctor uncles, I ignored). I wish I could talk more and do more things with him. I admit some sort of jealousy when I hear my friends and cousins talking about stuff their dads buy and do for them. But my dad has been supportive and encouraging for all the rough patches in my life so I can't complain. When I was stressing about step 1, he encouraged me to see a psychologist and to consider medication and told me taking a year off was fine (I ended up just buckling down and biting the bullet). For him, academic/career failure is just something you need to try again at.  My mom and I are a lot more open but we get into a lot more arguments. She is a lot tougher on me for...everything. I spent a good portion of my life trying to please her. Even to this day, buying something as simple as a dress, I worry that she won't like it (she will often bully me into returning the item in question). I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to buying her a gift (hello Mother's Day!) or taking her out to eat. Sunday will be...interesting.   They do a good job of acknowledging that I have a problem in my life but my dad is more nuanced about how to approach it while my mother is better at dealing with raw emotions. I don't think my dad has heard about a single problem my boyfriend and I have while my mom knows it all!"
ABCDesis,35aq9z,recycledpaper,4,Sat May 9 00:18:56 2015 UTC,"My depression started toward the end of middle school. It's been on and off since then. Mostly on, if I'm being honest--but the last year has been good.  There was definitely some friction with my parents. I think it was difficult for them to understand. They'd ask why I felt depressed; I wouldn't know. During undergrad I fell behind with my classes and they couldn't see why I didn't just get things done. Sometimes they would say things like ""You used to be smart""... which was obviously pretty hurtful. We had a lot of conflict about what I'd do after my undergrad. And they've never been especially happy with me taking meds.   But despite all that, they did try to be supportive. I know it was tough for them too. They didn't like that I was taking meds--but they never stopped me. If I had to go back on... yeah, they'd be unhappy. But I think they'd deal with it. It helps to have an awesome family doc who can explain things in a way they understand.   So it was difficult and awful but they did try, which I appreciate a lot."
ABCDesis,35aq9z,arsy-varsy,6,Sat May 9 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"""Bullying is just something they show on TV. Just keep your head down and do your work and don't ever talk in class.""    ""Omg is that an indian kid? Do you know them? Are they in your class? Are they your friend? Why aren't you friends with them?"" - said about any random brown kid in the vicinity of the school. Also I wasn't friends with them BECAUSE IT WAS SOME KID I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.  About any non-desi friends: ""That kid is so fake, I can't believe you think they're actually your friend. They're just waiting to use you and drop you. Have they ever done anything nice for you? Of course not.""  - wow thanks for that, apparently only brown people can be ""real friends""???    About the few non-desi friends they liked: ""Yeah they're a good kid but they're not brown [like us]."" - lovely advice, totally going to keep that in mind /s    Isolation: they heavily encouraged this, it was so weird. Their stance on socializing was simple: if you had something to say to a friend, you could say it at school.  There was no need to talk to someone or see someone outside of school hours.  They would always remind me that they (parents) and to an extent my sibling are the only people who cared at all about me and everyone else would abandon me at some point if I ever tried to rely on them/ask them for help, etc. Anything a ""friend"" said was just superficial. So even though we moved around a lot and I went to a lot of different schools I was really bad at making friends.  This is also because I was a nerdy introvert. It wasn't until HS/Uni that I really made close friends.  A lot of that was also due to the fact that we finally stopped moving.  A few years ago (I wasn't living at home anymore) they were lamenting that ""You never brought any of your friends over to the house, it just makes us sad to see you like that."".  I was speechless.  You banned me from talking to anyone outside of school why would I suddenly bring someone to our house???    If I ever tried to discuss something with them, they would either ignore or dismiss it. Now they complain about how I never tell them anything. I WONDER WHY. They also instilled in me this sense of ""if you tell someone something, then they know about you and it makes you look bad. And you're also just burdening them with your problems which is pretty selfish."" I ended up just trying to take care of everything myself whenever there's a problem and it's not really the greatest strategy.  I'm trying to talk more to my friends/SO about stuff now but it's a hard habit to shake.    My parents tried to pretend we were in India and raise me and my sibling according to those standards even though we were in North America and most places we lived had a very small or nonexistent desi community. It was not a good strategy.  They've mellowed out a lot when dealing with my sister who is quite a bit younger than me, so I'm glad to see that.  However my sister also has a moderately severe food allergy and my mom especially is always hovering around her.  My mom honestly acts like it's some kind of disability and not something that can be dealt with.  My sister though is pretty responsible in taking care of herself and doesn't see it the same way.  Most of these issues got better or are getting better since I moved out a few years ago.  edit: that turned into a wall of text...sorry :/"
ABCDesis,35aq9z,-drbadass-,3,Sat May 9 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"I was bullied a lot up until maybe freshman year of high school (I fought a kid that tried to grab my ass, and successfully scared off most bullied and creeps.) My mom didn't give a shit and I don't even think my dad knows what grade I'm in. I have depression and anxiety (including panic attacks) issues and again, my mom couldn't care less. However, if she sees another persons kid frowning it makes her sad. I've never had very many friends, or anyone I can really open up to, and I've always been the stupidest person I know (my friends all have at least a 4.5 gpa while I have many a 3.75 w) Because of all this I feel like I have no future whatsoever and I'll probably never find people in comfortable with, but I guess we'll have to see how that turns out."

Frankly they didn't really care what was going on in my life as long as I was getting good grades and keeping a good image in the Bengali community. Basically the first time they actually tried to figure out what was going on was when I got put on academic probation for beating the shit of a kid who had been making my 7th grade life hell for being brown. After that my parents sat me down and had a serious talk with me, and offered me a lot of options including transferring (which I had been asking for since 5th grade), but I decided to stick it out in that school until high school. Since then my parents have made a point of staying updated with my life and having open conversations which is great, especially now that university is giving me serious stress. Basically I learned that no matter what, we have to try to force open conversation if we're to have any hope of dealing with this stuff."

Thirty years old now and I really want to restart (listening to  Maharaja Santhanapuram right now, melds well with Passion Pit & Wu-Tang that I had on earlier today).

ABCDesis,358dqt,LotusEyes92,2,Fri May 8 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Actually it's just colour balancing to get more colour out  of a shot. It's relatively little.   If you want to try download rawtherapy and head down to r/photography. There is a weekly challenge photo that you can download and fool around with the settings.
ABCDesis,358dqt,Anandya,1 point,Fri May 8 07:05:59 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks. But still, technically the editing might be very little but it still takes away from the raw beauty in my opinion. But I'll check that sub out :)"
ABCDesis,358dqt,LotusEyes92,1 point,Fri May 8 07:25:12 2015 UTC,I think it has made photography more accessible but its a subjective art. I like it!

ABCDesis,358dqt,mangolicious989,3,Fri May 8 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"PhotoShop is not an evil. PhotoShop cannot fix composition, what it can do is fix errors or do film tricks on a grand scale.   The composition is fantastic. The exposure seems to produce a fairy tale quality. So the photos colours are richer and way more vibrant in order to show of India and its colour.  It allows you to take photos quickly and not worry so much about getting the photo settings right because you can fix problems later.   And I prefer it over the black and white photos of the poor done to hide bad composition."

ABCDesis,358dqt,waynerooney501,2,Fri May 8 03:11:24 2015 UTC,Then travel yourself and do cool things. Don't claim they are harming our world when we refuse to do what they do. We have no similar spirit of adventure and go to places to see things out of our comfort zone.  I once walked the grand canyon. Most Indians were more interested in my shopping. Guess why we don't have cool photos?  And this ignores the fact that Indians are mad for photography. I have not seen as many dslr and mirrorless anywhere else. What you should worry about? Is how we leverage our photos.
ABCDesis,358dqt,Anandya,6,Fri May 8 07:03:36 2015 UTC,Can we please not stoop to making silly generalisations because of someone's idiocy? Most people in general are interested in shopping and staying in their comfort zone. That's humans in general.
ABCDesis,358dqt,LotusEyes92,2,Fri May 8 07:32:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but remember a lot of Indians are not as adventurous and think the adventurous ones are wasting their time. But also I do point out that National geographic India has an amazing amateur photography section from India due to our taste for the art."
ABCDesis,358dqt,Anandya,3,Fri May 8 07:52:00 2015 UTC,Most Indians are too busy trying to make themselves financially secure. They either are or come from a poor background hence money is always on their mind. But what you say maybe true but it does no good to generalise like this.

The issue of the corruption of Ambani influence to all media outlets who won't let one bad word against the family come out... where's the uproar about that with the Auntijis?

Also, India's prison terms are generally much smaller than the US. Life imprisonment generally means 14 years before parole hearing. It's a very rare case that people convicted for ""life"" don't get out on parole after 14 years. Many people are freed earlier if they have proven to have turned their lives around."

So I just said screw it and went for it. I didnt experience disapproval from my family but I did experience their fear. As immigrants our parents saw the arts as an unsafe option. unsafe financially, and socially. But I just proved to them I was committed and I just stuck with it.

ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,6,Thu May 7 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"There is a distinct duality that comes with the territory of being a minority in a foreign country.  Especially so when your motherland is as prideful of their identity as India.    For example, as Indian Americans, we grow constantly being reminded that we are not American.  When, we go back home, we are branded asn ""NRI's"" reminded we are not one of them either.  My question is this, as Indian Americans, do you think our identity lies in finding the balance between these two cultures? Or do you think Indian Americans have a responsibility to form their own identity, separate from Indian and American cultures?"
ABCDesis,357tg7,bug-bear,3,Thu May 7 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"Thats a dope question,  I would argue that finding a balance between these two cultures will inherently create a new identity. but I do think yes, we have to acknowledge that in some ways we are a new culture altogether, we are: American Desis."
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,3,Thu May 7 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"Do you think that identity is transient, though? As Desis we make up less than 1% of the population. Even if you marry another Desi-American, your kids could end up marrying outside the culture, and there's no guarantee that the heritage would be passed on. Do you think the American Desis culture will be large or strong enough to continue through several generations?"
ABCDesis,357tg7,slamdunk2020,2,Thu May 7 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"No, but I can see why sharing similar identity struggles would be an important aspect of a relationship"
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,2,Thu May 7 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"I see your point and that's why I think it's important to love us. I don't think we all have to marry within our race. But I do think if we all marry outside of the race, or we don't learn to love ourselves, the culture does run a greater risk of being lost, especially two or three generations down the road. But if we can instill that pride, that love for ourselves, we can carry that identity much further into the future."
ABCDesis,357tg7,GWmyc2,2,Thu May 7 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"Thats up to us to decide. you do not need a lot of people in order to keep alive heritage.

ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,3,Thu May 7 21:17:39 2015 UTC,When can we see you live in India...does it happen soon?
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,2,Thu May 7 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"thankfully soon is a vague enough term that I can say yes! but truthfully, probably not until at least another year. we are still building this and I am going to be shootin in Vancouver for the rest of the year. But that is something we want to do for sure!"
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,2,Thu May 7 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"one thing that will make it easier to get out there sooner, is if there is a way we can get more people in India listening to the podcast!"
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,3,Thu May 7 21:37:52 2015 UTC,How did you land into making a podcast for American Desis? Was there a specific incident that led you down this path?
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,4,Thu May 7 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"A friend of Arjun's overheard him talking to me on the phone and said to him ""You guys have a funny banter; you should start a podcast."" Then when he approached me with the idea, there was one concept we had constantly debated- what is the place of our Indianness in America- and I knew that was the only thing the podcast could be about. He obviously was completely on board, and here we are."
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,3,Thu May 7 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"Who are your comedic inspirations, Akaaash?"
ABCDesis,357tg7,energyturtle_ak,3,Thu May 7 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"Love this question. I love anybody who challenges what is generally accepted, and guys who are smart but never try to prove how smart they are. So my favorite ever is Patrice Oneal. After that it's Chappelle, Rock, and Bill Burr. Also I love Kevin Hart because he's hilarious and I wouldn't be doing this if Russell Peters didn't make it possible."
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,2,Thu May 7 21:44:57 2015 UTC,And when are we going to see your special?
ABCDesis,357tg7,varunisonfire,6,Thu May 7 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Haha working on it, Buddy. Lemme know if you're in NY and want tickets to a show. I got you."
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,3,Thu May 7 21:53:58 2015 UTC,Do you guys have any advice for people wanting to start a podcast? Is it difficult to start? What kinds of challenges did you guys face (in getting it out there?)
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,2,Thu May 7 21:47:24 2015 UTC,Starting a podcast is relatively easy these days. all you need is a mic and garageband. so starting it is easy. the key to building something is believing in the show you are creating and staying consistent! it has to be a passion for you because it takes a while to start seeing results! and thats ok! but the act of making the podcast itself needs to be enough.
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,3,Thu May 7 21:51:45 2015 UTC,"It's a pain in the ass, honestly; It's a lot of work; It costs a good amount of money; and it can take a while before you feel like you're making an impact. So if you do it, make sure it's something you're passionate about. Because that passion will be tested."
ABCDesis,357tg7,energyturtle_ak,3,Thu May 7 21:52:18 2015 UTC,Your podcasts are pretty awesome. What kind of comedy has probably influenced you during your earlier days. Does comedy come naturally to you guys?
ABCDesis,357tg7,energyturtle_ak,3,Thu May 7 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think comedy came naturally to me, honestly. I was a shy kid until like fourth grade. Then being funny became something I wanted to do, and I guess I focused on it and honed it. Been working on it ever since.  The kind of comedy that influences me is smart, challenging humor. Like, it's super trendy to be liberal and bash republicans. So I go the other way. I've always been influenced by people who did that.  Also Bugs Bunny."
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,2,Thu May 7 22:02:46 2015 UTC,"well Akaash is a comedian and he works on that craft all the time. My humor comes more in conversation and being quick. which if we really want to strike at the core of, is part of my defense mechanism :)"
ABCDesis,357tg7,energyturtle_ak,3,Thu May 7 22:00:19 2015 UTC,Are there any topics that are taboo for you guys? Also what topics that are considered verboten in the SA community would you like to shine a greater light on?
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,6,Thu May 7 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like talking about sex, but Arjun keeps making me. That's a constant debate on the show. That's pretty much it."

Akaash is uncomfortable with talk about sex, but I push for it. and there are things Akaash pushes for us to talk about. We definitely wan a shine light on our lack of acceptance of other cultures, and homophobia in the community. our next episode is D' Lo who is a transgender Sri Lankan. excited about giving voice to those who don't always get one."

ABCDesis,357tg7,avsingh1200,3,Thu May 7 21:11:02 2015 UTC,its great interacting with you Lovingymnastics! what do you mean talk about sports in a more cultural and social context?
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,2,Thu May 7 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"Like how us Indian Americans take pride and participate by engaging in sports by actively watching Cricket (a sport we learned under colonial and imperial rule) and how we've gained footage in the world of sports through that. Alongside the rise of stellar athletes such as Sania Mirza, Saina Nehwal, Mary Kom and how they're making India better known and also inspiring many Indian Americans"
ABCDesis,357tg7,avsingh1200,3,Thu May 7 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, this is a cool area to talk about. I am gonna do some research because I don't know a lot about some of these people but we should talk about this!"
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,3,Thu May 7 21:30:43 2015 UTC,See! This is what I am excited about. getting responses and ideas of what to talk about from the community! But lovingymnastics. why don't you write a blog about it and start the convo on our website! talk about all of this. and we can further the convo!
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,2,Thu May 7 21:31:34 2015 UTC,ahhh that sounds like a great idea!
ABCDesis,357tg7,lovingymnastics,2,Thu May 7 21:35:01 2015 UTC,we look forward to your blog post. send it to americandesispodcast@gmail.com
ABCDesis,357tg7,AkaashSingh,2,Thu May 7 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting point about Cricket. It seems like got very good at things that were thrust upon us through Imperialism and they ended up becoming more ours than theirs (""Chai"" comes to mind immediately). As for the second part, I honestly don't think many American Desis know about any of those athletes. I know and root for Sania Mirza as someone who follows tennis, but I also know she don't seem to win much. So I'm not sure how inspired by them we are. Maybe I'm wrong though."
ABCDesis,358fs0,TeslaModelE,9,Thu May 7 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"Sikhi is pretty explicitly against fasting as a religious ritual. That said, I would like to try it out in my personal life once, maybe I'll do it for a future girlfriend for Karva Chauth or with my friends during Ramadan."
ABCDesis,358fs0,asdfioho,3,Fri May 8 00:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, we are not supposed to fast. However, two of my aunts still do on occasion for Karva Chauth or Navaratri I think."
ABCDesis,358fs0,Lola1479,3,Fri May 8 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think my Nani Ji did it as well...as they say, old habits die hard!"
ABCDesis,358fs0,asdfioho,8,Fri May 8 02:19:16 2015 UTC,"I was raised a Hindu, and when I was a teenager, my parents and other relatives encouraged me to fast on Mondays for Shiva. Many women traditionally do this basically in order to pray for a husband. It comes from the story of how Parvati won Shiva's attention by mediating and fasting.   I stopped doing it because it was impractical and it made me very irritable. I was super active in high school, and I would go from one activity to another. I frequently wasn't able to keep my energy and enthusiasm because of fasting which defeats the purpose, to clear the mind and focus one's thoughts on the divine. Later, I became disturbed by the sexism of fasting within the culture in which I was raised. People who are supposed to be householders (men) are not supposed to fast.  At least, this is what I was taught growing up. I don't know if others had similar or different experiences.   I also remember fasting for a week during the summer, once a year, from ages 12-15. I don't remember why though. I'm pretty disconnected from Hinduism these days.    Edit: discovered what this fast was for. It's for gauri vrat or Jaya Parvati Vrat. Traditionally done for 5 days in June or July, and girls at the end of the day break their fast with an unsalted meal. Traditionally done for 5, 7, or 9 years. Ha ha, I only lasted 3! One of my cousins did it for 7 years!   As for rules, we'd be able to eat a serving of fruit in the afternoon followed by a meal at the end of the day, usually after sunset. My mom would just make whatever was my favorite meal at the time. No meat ever. My mother sometimes observes a half day or a full day of silence when she fasts, and she fasts once a week on Mondays. My grandmother fasted on Mondays until she started experiencing health problems (associated with age, not fasting)."
ABCDesis,358fs0,mayfly42,2,Fri May 8 00:47:18 2015 UTC,"What's your ethnicity, if you don't mind sharing? First time hearing of this tradition."

ABCDesis,358fs0,mayfly42,5,Fri May 8 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"Muslim, so you know about the fasting.  Both my husband and I do not fast (we give fidya instead, though). I also do try to abstain from all of the non-food things as well (cursing, fighting, sex, etc).  I have diabetes that gets all wonky if I don't eat my snacks throughout the day. Husband has pretty bad IBS. My family gives me so much crap for not fasting - 'I have diabetes, I fast, you should be able to do it, too.' Nevermind that everyone's bodies are different, nevermind that my doctor has told me I should not be fasting."
ABCDesis,358fs0,bug-bear,2,Fri May 8 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I learned some things about you, lol! Now I can picture you better.   But yeah, don't worry about what others say. You do you!

ABCDesis,358fs0,x6tance,2,Fri May 8 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"I guess somewhat ironically, fasting has shown to improve insulin sensitivity and extended water fasts (just drinking water and not eating) has shown to help IBS symptoms. Basically the body is building a new immune system with 72+ hour water fasts. I'm starting a 48 hour water fast tonight."
ABCDesis,358fs0,bug-bear,2,Fri May 8 09:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it helps some people, I definitely believe that. But again, i think it comes down to knowing your body and having talks with your doctor.  We have both tried fasting. I get some scary lows in sugar if I don't. For me specifically, there are safer ways to help insulin sensitivity :)  I'm actually a bit surprised with it helping ibs, since there are so many different issues that could be behind it. Husband has tried fasting and ends up having intense pain by the end of the day (""I want to go to the hospital"" kind of pain). He's also kinda scarily underweight."
ABCDesis,358fs0,oinkyy,2,Fri May 8 12:14:07 2015 UTC,Obviously I would always go with what a doctor said. I've seen YouTube videos of people who cured themselves of these ailments by doing 21 day water fasts. They were on a retreat of some kind in Costa Rica. I can't imagine doing somehow like that win work and personal obligations.
ABCDesis,358fs0,Bustcratch,8,Fri May 8 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"...I don't think you can ""cure"" yourself of diabetes OR IBS. Those are things you manage (and can manage well, to the point where you have no symptioms!) but not ""cure.""   IBS sufferer here. Homeopathy doctor that my parents love and used to force me to go to when I was in high school once told me to do a kashayam fast for five days or something (where all I got to have was kashayam.)

ABCDesis,358fs0,GWmyc2,4,Fri May 8 01:26:19 2015 UTC,yea. I usually dont cuz doc disapproves. Shivratri fasting includes water & fruit for the 24hrs.

ABCDesis,358fs0,GWmyc2,6,Fri May 8 08:53:44 2015 UTC,"Probably the most common example of fasting on this sub will be fasting during the month of Ramadan. For those who don't know, fasting during Ramadan is all about self-control, not just from food and drinks but from impious acts as well.  The person fasting must abstain from the following* between sunrise and sunset:   All foods All drinks (yeah - try doing that during the warmer months) Sexual intercourse Obscene speeches, arguments and fighting Lying, slander, gossip   For Muslims, the emphasis is a spiritual cleanse that is driven by physical and mental actions.  I know a lot of families tend to break their fast with a ton of carbs, greasy and fried foods and other heavy things. I prefer a nice glass of lemonade and some dates.  *If I've missed something, let me know."
ABCDesis,358fs0,Vishuddha_94,8,Thu May 7 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"I prefer a nice glass of lemonade and some dates.   I prefer my dates get drinks with me, coffee is fine though. Also, how many dates are we talking? Like 4-5 different women? I usually prefer one at a time. No need to disappoint so many women so quickly especially after fasting all day."

ABCDesis,358fs0,b_digital,3,Fri May 8 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"My parents fast during Ekadashi/Agyaras. It occurs roughly twice a month, or more specifically on the 11th day of every lunar month in the Hindu calendar. It's usually people that practice some type of Vaishnava Hinduism that do this fast (and I think also during Janmashtami and Shivratri).   My parents are already vegetarians and they don't eat onions or garlic, so for them Ekadashi fasting is staying away from grains and beans (so no wheat, rice, dal, roti etc) and certain vegetables (no carrots, corn, bell peppers, karela, etc), and anything derived from those foods. Water and any sort of fruit are fine.  My family is Gujarati, so no one celebrates or fasts during Karva Chauth"
ABCDesis,358fs0,b_digital,3,Fri May 8 02:03:45 2015 UTC,I fast on Mondays and in holidays. Fasting usually means no meat products.

It's nothing compared to the fasting that other religions do, but I just don't care enough to do it. It just doesn't isn't a meaningful activity to me. And i mean that only for myself, I don't judge anyone who does fast for religious reasons.   But I do judge those who fast as part of some trendy diet thing. those people are just stupid"
ABCDesis,358fs0,YouHaveTakenItTooFar,2,Fri May 8 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"Fasting for health and not religion is not a trendy diet thing. Doctors are prescribing a 24 hour fast once a week for health reasons. It boosts immune system, has anti-aging effects, and helps prevent cancer.

I'm curious. I have a Punjabi Sikh friend who did his early living in Punjab and now, he's been here in America for well over a decade. He's a veg by choice and he can't stand spices. I found that interesting. I know Punjabi food isn't exactly known to be spicy, but, I've never met someone vehemently against it either."
ABCDesis,356jy5,b_digital,1 point,Thu May 7 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"I used to reject anything spicy until college. I did a summer study abroad program in London one year and one night everyone in the group wanted to go to Brick road and have Indian food. Being the only Indian in the group I didn't want to tell everyone I hated Indian food, so I went along.  And I'm so glad I did. I picked something that sounded as non-spicy as I could guess at. It ended up being moderately spicy (and I can't remember what it was to be honest). But I fucking loved it.   That was kind of my gateway in to opening my mind and palate to Indian food, and by extension spicy Indian food. I fuckin' love it now."

Lots of Punjabi dishes are quite heavy on the garam masala.  I love spicy/spiced foods but I can also understand how someone might find it overpowering. Like some people feel that their food should primarily taste of the main ingredient and all flavorings should complement it and not hide it (I guess this is a more Western idea), but on the other hand, I love the layers of flavor that spices can create as in Desi foods."

ABCDesis,354nhm,sampak,7,Thu May 7 06:02:44 2015 UTC,Based on social media you'd think this show was doing really well. That's what I thought anyways. Hulu or any other web deal might be perfect for thing for this show.
ABCDesis,354nhm,Nylese,2,Thu May 7 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"It rates pretty well when you take into consideration playback, but you can't really sell commercials based on that because people like to skip through them.

ABCDesis,354nhm,KaliYugaz,5,Thu May 7 03:15:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, The Mindy Project was only middling in ratings, I believe. MK herself is wildly popular which perhaps contributed to the show's longevity.   I've never seen Firefly but I wouldn't put TMP in the same class as any of those shows. It was a funny show, but it had structural and narrative problems that really prevented it from taking off, IMO. I can't say I'm surprised it got axed but I'm sure that there's more in MK's future than this."
ABCDesis,354nhm,frackaracka,5,Thu May 7 04:15:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm not surprised either but really hope hulu pick it up. I think the show has a lot of potential. Maybe this will give them more creative freedom? In any case I'll look forward to anything mindy has to put out :)

I'm happy that Indian Americans are getting represented in our media, but at the end of the day she's just a brown face among a sea of white. We saw glimpses towards the last few episodes, she wore a sari, talked about her parents (whom we never saw). Any time her religion or ethnicity was mentioned, it was a joke. Not to mention that she dated white guys exclusively. This show could be true to her experience in life, but as a comedy it rarely poked fun at her ""whiteness."" She was applauded for trying to assimilate.   I enjoyed the show, but it wasn't what I would hope it would be ideally. I'm glad it was cancelled."

More of her actual heritage could have been included but it might have shifted the focus of what she wanted the show to be.  I do definitely think there were issues that should have been addressed in the show that weren't - for example both of her serious relationships are with practicing Christians and she identifies as a non-practicing Hindu but this is barely mentioned, which is....unrealistic."

ABCDesis,354nhm,-drbadass-,1 point,Fri May 8 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"actually it is addressed in the show - I just didn't remember since I saw the eps quite a while ago. I was looking up one of the season 3 eps afterwards and she does discuss with Danny about how the baby will be raised as Catholic.  But I think back when she was with Casey it's just mentioned and then they never come back to it.  And Casey is a pastor - well, used to be.  It's surprising that they didn't talk in more detail about what kind of wedding they would have and how to raise their kids, especially since they were engaged. Those kinds of discussions definitely happen with interfaith marriages and I thought it was unrealistic to gloss over that (though they did get into it in season 3)."

ABCDesis,352rzi,akbar-great_chai-tea,1 point,Thu May 7 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"When Maslow's hierarchy talks about sex, it includes visiting prostitutes and masturbation in sex acts.   As for companionship, the men's living arrangements look like they have plenty of companionship. The idea that marriage is a romantic bond is a Victorian ideal that's still not the norm in many societies. The idea that sex and companionship has to come from the same person is a very modern, American concept in which men tend not to have deep friendships beyond childhood. Even uber-masculine Victorian British men valued the friendship and company of other men, often more than their romantic partners and/or wives."

ABCDesis,352p80,roobixkyoob,9,Wed May 6 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Not really medical school, but my wife is going to start her residency (hopefully) this year and she's been prepping for USMLE this last year while we were married.  The only thing I can tell you is this - try to be as supportive as you can be. Medical school (and residency) are very very taxing, 80 hour work weeks are not unheard of. If you're in a job that affords flexible hours - just try to do more stuff around the house and help your SO out rather than it being strict 50/50.  In my case, I work in tech, have very flex hours, so I try to go in early, get out early so that I can cook every 2-3 days and clean on the weekends. This way my wife's not super stressed thinking about what to eat, when to cook, etc.  The other important thing to remember (especially coz you guys haven't lived together yet) is to make some ""you and him"" time - try to setup dates, go to movies, go for dinners, try doing things together.  On top of all this - all the cohabitation rules apply:   Find out where the two of you stand on cleanliness - this was a big point of contention between my wife and I. I would vacuum only once every few months, she wants it done every week, for e.g. (yeah, I'm kind of a slob when it comes to vacuuming) Find out where the two of you stand on ""me"" time. My wife and I are pretty good about taking some time off for ourselves. To me it's gym and sports time to her it's the time she spends with her friends and/or studying alone. Find out where the two of you stand on finances. Will all of your money be in a joint account? Since he's in school, he most likely won't be able to pay 50-50, so how do you guys split it without feeling resentment? Will you each have your ""own"" money? How about saving up for the future? Split tasks in a way that makes sense. Since he's going to be in med school, he'll not have a lot of time, but it also shouldn't feel like you're doing 100% of everything around the house - I've seen that build into resentment over time. COMMUNICATE   Good luck with this. It's going to be hard, but not insurmountable. My wife and I did a long distance relationship while she was prepping for USMLE and applying for her residency. It CAN be done. You just have to be willing to put the effort in and learn to communicate with each other."
ABCDesis,352p80,analystdude,4,Wed May 6 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"Seconding everything in this reply. I'm the med student and my husband is the SO but this is all very true. The best chores to give to him are those that can be done any time vs. at a scheduled time. For example, my husband takes out the trash and recycling whereas I clean the bathroom.   Find out where the two of you stand on cleanliness - this was a big >point of contention between my wife and I. I would vacuum only >once every few months, she wants it done every week   Also very true. My husband thinks the bathroom needs to be cleaned once or twice a year. I do not....so I clean the bathroom."
ABCDesis,352p80,motor_mouth,3,Wed May 6 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"dude, you and I have nearly identical situations. I'm a tech guy with super flexible hours and married to a physician. We married after my wife's first year of med school and pretty much everything you said is spot on.   I knew that I could not expect to see her very often, or on any particular schedule, and I basically thought of myself as a bachelor who couldn't sleep with other women. So at least until we had our first child during her 4th year, I played a lot of golf. I did most of the cooking and chores at our house.  I'm the more clean-obsessed one in the marriage, and I also have a tendency to get really irritated when i'm doing all of the cleaning. But I also knew it wasn't reasonable to expect her to do much given the demands of med school and residency. So I hired a maid service. I don't think I would ever not have that as long as our income lets us afford it. We jokingly call our maid the secret to our marriage.   Anyway, as you said communication is key. This can't work if we both don't know exactly how we divide up the normal roles in a family. If one of the kids is sick, I'm the ""it"" parent who needs to stay home with them or take them to the doctor. I'm the one who goes to school functions. Anything that requires scheduling, is essentially on me. When she's home, she almost always takes over, especially with our 9 month old. She does everyone's laundry. I handle all the finances.  It's all stuff we talked about at length so expectations were set and assumptions weren't made.   where we need to do better is have more time for the two of us. We always feel guilty leaving the kids with a sitter but whenever we do get away we promise ourselves we'll do it more frequently.   anyway, long story short-- a spouse in med school requires a lot of sacrifice on the part of the one that isn't in medicine, and it'll only work if you know what you're getting into and willing to do it."
ABCDesis,352p80,b_digital,1 point,Wed May 6 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"Mad props to you for dealing with all that I deal with plus a kid, dude!  That's not something we're ready for just yet. I keep telling my wife that we'll have kids ""before we turn 40"" haha!"
ABCDesis,352p80,analystdude,1 point,Wed May 6 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i realize i'm not typical in this regard, but I wanted to have kids earlier rather than later, and I've never had qualms about being the primary caregiver, which becomes somewhat mandatory when mom is in med school/residency.   Obviously, me wanting to have kids is still a matter of my wife being ready, and the original plan was to wait until after residency. But we had a happy little accident while she was a 4th year med student. And our second child was more according to the original plan. so we have a 7 year old and a 9 month old. The big gap is not all that normal either, but it comes with a lot of advantages when one kid is mostly self sufficient."
ABCDesis,352p80,b_digital,1 point,Thu May 7 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"This is really great advice, thank you. The points on cohabitation are especially valuable as this will be entirely new for us. Me time, I didn't even think of that, god..   Do you think there are specifics if the genders are reversed, as they are in my case?"
ABCDesis,352p80,analystdude,3,Wed May 6 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"Me time, I didn't even think of that, god..   Some couples are okay with doing everything together, but I myself need my alone time every once in a while. There is such thing as ""too much of each other"". I feel like it's important to have your own hobbies and things to do.  As much as this just makes me a walking talking stereotype, I hate shopping. And as much as this just makes my wife a walking talking stereotype she doesn't really enjoy fights and action movies. So I do ""fight nights"" or ""action movie nights"" with my buddies and she goes shopping without me and we're both totally cool with it.   Do you think there are specifics if the genders are reversed, as they are in my case?   It entirely depends on the relationship dynamic. Both my wife and I are very egalitarian in outlook, i.e. believe there are no strict ""gender roles"" in the house. We decided early on that as much as possible we'll split household chores. But now that she's in exam prep mode and later going to be in 80 hours of work mode, I have to do a bit more around the house while she deals with it. In your case that responsibility might fall on you.  Also, we have some small-ish ground rules about what to do when we're going to be late, stay out with friends, unforeseen exceptions occur, etc.  For example, if I'm having a crazy day at work or going to a post work happy hour and cannot get out early to do the things I promised I'd do, I just give my wife a heads up and tell her to order food and most of the time she's okay with it.  Like I said on the comment above, communication is the most important thing in a relationship. Not communicating and doing things out of obligation will only build resentment over time.   Think of your partnership as being a part of a team, it's never you vs. him it's always you and him vs. a problem. This outlook has helped me tremendously.  Good luck :)"

If he went to law school, it's reasonable to assume that he's smart enough to know--intellectually--what to do.  That's not his point.  I feel you, OP.  For the longest time, I was the black sheep of my local desi community.  I got bad grades in school (mostly because I was just unmotivated), went into the arts instead of STEM, didn't go to a highly ranked university.  My parents and I had to constantly hear about all the other families' children who were doctors, engineers, MBAs, or in some way rich & successful.  If I wasn't at college, I was living with my parents...well into my late 20s.  I always felt ashamed and guilty that my life path meant my parents couldn't be proud of me with their fellow desis.  They just had to stay quiet or come up with a way to deflect conversation about what I was doing.  Even though I knew I hadn't done anything ""wrong"" per se, it still felt like I had wronged my parents somehow.  But as much pain as I was in, it hurts me more when I can't be me.  That's ultimate pain for me.  Regardless of what we believe, most of us agree that this will be the only chance we get to live this lifetime.  No matter how happy my parents or anyone else will be, if inside I'm hollow and empty...what the fuck is the point?  Would that really be any better?  Anyway, I've been in a very similar place to you not too long ago.  In some ways, I'm kind of where you are now just in a different area of my life.  You're not alone.  We all feel sometimes like we made bad choices and that it's too late.  It's not.  Not that you should go be a doctor now, but just remember that nothing is shut off for good.  Take some time, feel what you feel, then when you're ready take a fresh look.  And if you need advice, we've got some real smart people in this sub who are here for you."

ABCDesis,34ysmh,jot_,4,Tue May 5 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"So yes, it sucks. And I say this as my very sweet partner is studying for the bar exam and as a soon to be medical school grad.   Med school is awful. I hated the first two years of reading only. I NEVER would have cut it in law school. I designed my college classes to avoid as many papers as possible. I would have DIED in med school. Handwriting a note past a page would be a nightmare for me. But if I hadn't matched, I would have broken down. The med game isn't as secure as it was before. More grads but same number of residency spots = a lot more Black Mondays. And don't even factor in the debt.   Law school is tough and I know the job market is uncertain (the guy and I are worried about spending my entire residency apart). Like you, he's worried about ""providing"" for me (I hate that mentality). Have faith in yourself that things will work out (that's what we're doing...hopefully it works).   As immilaw says, if you really want med school, it's possible. My best friend in med school went to law school, practiced for a few years, did his prereqs and then went to med school. He's now starting a gen surg residency at the age of 36."
ABCDesis,34ysmh,recycledpaper,6,Wed May 6 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you weren't really drawn to medicine. You shouldn't go into medicine if it's not something that every fiber of your being demands that you do.   Honestly, I get really angry at the people who go into medicine because of parental expectations or for the money and prestige. First of all if you're not in it for the patients, you'll be a shitty doctor. Secondly, the money and prestige are not what it used to be. When you factor 7-10 years of your lifetime earnings are erased while you're in med school and residency, it takes a while to catch up. If you need student loans to get through med school, it's even worse.   Then, depending on your specialty, you might not make the type of money you were hoping for. The highest paid specialties are surgical. So that's a 7 year residency at a minimum, assuming you don't sub-specialize. Aside from the lengthy road, they're extremely competitive. Family/Peds usually have a 3 year residency and better hours. But, depending on where you live, the income might be shocking. Not too long ago in the Raleigh, NC area, the average pediatrician was making just over the six figure mark. Not a bad living by any means, but it's only worth the journey if you're going to love what you do.   All this is from the experience of being married to a doctor. We've been together since undergrad, so I was there for med school, residency, and she's 2 years into private practice as an anesthesiologist and 34 years old. She works 55-70 hours a week. I would be miserable. She loves her job. She loves the work, the patient care, all of the right reasons. and couldn't give a shit less about the pay... which is a much bigger deal to me.   Anyway, all of this is to say, No-- don't go into medicine just because your uncles or aunts tell you to. Decide what kind of lifestyle you want, first and foremost. Figure out what careers will lend you that lifestyle, in the context of risk/economic considerations, etc. Then see what best aligns with your interests and go after it.   So, what did you plan on doing with your JD? a JD is a versatile degree and doesn't mean you have to practice traditional law. Yeah there's a glut of lawyers right now, so perhaps you'll need to explore a non-traditional career path to wind up at your desired income level.  So you've had some time to vent. The only way to get what you want is to take action. So the questions is, what are you going to do to improve your situation?"
ABCDesis,34ysmh,b_digital,4,Tue May 5 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I get really angry at the people who go into medicine because of parental expectations or for the money and prestige. First of all if you're not in it for the patients, you'll be a shitty doctor.    why? honestly, I don't see why everyone thinks doctors must be in it only for others. That's like saying, if you aren't in it for making everyone a nice house but instead you are in it for the money then you are a shitty person. Like what? a lot of people are in it for the money."
ABCDesis,34ysmh,IndianAmericanteen,8,Tue May 5 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"In a profession that's about taking care of people, if you don't care about the people, if you don't have empathy for your patients, if you're not a patient advocate, then I would say that you're not a good doctor, and possibly a shitty human being.   The doctors who try to maximize the number of patients they see and minimize the time spent with each patient to increase revenue are terrible doctors.  The doctors who nudge their patients towards an expensive surgery when physical therapy would be just as effective are terrible doctors.  The doctors who see an impoverished patient, assume they are uninsured and provide substandard care are terrible doctors.  The fact is, when you are solely profit-motivated, your actions tend to be driven by what's best for your wallet, rather than what's best for your patient.   If you're solely in it for the money, radiology is probably the right specialty for you. And honestly, there are many easier paths to high income jobs than medicine."
ABCDesis,34ysmh,b_digital,5,Wed May 6 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"Your idealism is a common sentiment I've encountered among members of the public..but the reality of the medical landscape is FAR different. If I had it my way, I'd open up a clinic for uninsured or indigent patients and treat them for free. But this can NEVER happen where I live...there are about 500 blocks of red tape and insurance/legal hurdles that can prevent this from becoming a reality. Medicaid reimbursements cover 60-75% of operating costs, maximum, so physicians who do see medicaid patients do so as a charity service. The costs don't come down to just doc's salary..there are also laboratory fees, radiology fees, nursing fees, etc. It's not as simplistic as you're making it out to be.   There are some doctors who are profit-motivated and run cash-only practices (e.g., plastic surgery, concierge medicine), but this doesn't mean they're bad doctors. They're just burnt out by the insurance paperwork maelstrom and want out and need a fast way to pay off their student loans.  The blame should be on our healthcare system and not with individual physicians."

Why would you say they are terrible doctors? They are just doing what is expected from the clinic administrators and limitations of the insurance companies. You post was holding doctors responsible for the things they don't control.
ABCDesis,34ysmh,coldcoldnovemberrain,1 point,Wed May 6 17:31:56 2015 UTC,"depends on the setting. And to be fair, I didn't do a good job articulating the context of that statement-- and I was specifically thinking about a doc who has his/her own practice where he or she IS in control, and specifically aims to maximize the # of visits they can bill.   The situation where you describe is more typical of the growing trend of larger corporations who contract with hospitals or have 'chains' of doctors offices where doctors tend to be salaried. Yes, in those cases they are generally at the mercy of the hospital/practice administrators.   Again, my overall point is that people who go into medicine first and foremost for the money tend to make poor doctors, if for no other reason than the fact that it's a not a good way to get rich."

In the United States, doctors are not spending that 5-10mins with you. They spend more hours dealing with the bureacratic paperwork and fighting medical and private insurance companies to  make sure their staff gets paid first. They would love to help the fellow being, but system is kind of stacked against them.   Try talking to your elected representative and let them know that you support Affordable Health Care Act and want programs which remove the bureaucracy and limit the ability of insurance companies to deny payment to health care providers."

The whole Protestant Ethic and finding salvation in work can lead to some ridiculous conclusions.  There's also a sinister side to this naive idealism about loving your work. Companies often exploit people's desire to work on something they love to pay them less. There's so much social pressure to ""do something that you love"" that people often accept much lower wages than they should. This happens frequently in idealized professions like social work, teaching, nursing etc. If you are good at something, there's no fault in earning your money doing that while pursuing your passion on the side."

The people I know who are doctors are very passionate about what they do. If you are just going do it for the money, you will end up burning yourself out.   You can use your law degree for other stuff. You can go into banking or even consulting and get paid more or equally, but end up working the same long hours."

The ability to make my own schedule, be able to work anywhere in the world, and escape the traditional employer-employee mindset are things that I appreciate.   You'll get to the right place if you are passionate at some point and work hard/smart in the future. Doubting yourself and thinking what if you went into medicine is the wrong path to go down. Resilience is key.    If you aren't passionate about medicine, you're doing yourself and your future patients a disservice. There's no competition to settle down - you'll do that when you are in the right place. Crafting your definition of success based on benchmarking yourself against a single quantitative metric (age) is suboptimal at best. You're optimizing for the short term for avoiding the discomfort of feeling like you are lesser than your friends. Look at the long run, figure out what success means for you, and go down that path.  TLDR: Stay in law if you are passionate about it. If not, there are many fields where you can use that degree effectively."

ABCDesis,34ysmh,JenniferHewitt,3,Thu Jun 18 05:01:48 2015 UTC,"Internal medicine resident here. I was thrust into the world of medicine by desi parents who emphasized a medical career with a maniacal frenzy. They're not wealthy people, but they saved for me to attend SAT prep classes, MCAT classes, and all of the other necessary preparation efforts for this path. Once I was accepted into medical school, they beamed with pride. Neither of my parents are physicians but they idealize the role of a physician as a culmination of everything that south asian immigrants strive for: stability, success, and a respectable position in our capitalistic society.  But let me tell you..the grass isn't always greener on the other side. I feel that embarking upon a medical career has taken an immense toll on my personal life and mental health. I can't say for sure whether or not this path is worth it... I'm also a single female and in my late 20's, with two failed long term relationships, both of which dissolved in the midst of my medical training. I can't attribute this exclusively to medicine, but I feel that it played a huge role, since I wasn't able to devote enough time to my SO's as I should have..and didn't take it upon myself to reach out to them in other ways. I worry about whether or not I will get married and conceive before my ticking biological clock runs out..  What many people don't realize about medical training in America is that it's fucking brutal. The training system is in many ways modeled after military training...though there have been reforms implemented in recent years , the medical culture resembles a caste system,where the attending physicians are revered to deity status. As both an intern and medical student, I've been humiliated to the point of tears. I also for the most part feel unappreciated and taken for granted, even when I spend so much extra time going the extra mile for my patients. Most of them are appreciative of my efforts, but many are not, even when my intentions are sincere..   There are certainly more well-adjusted physicians than I am, and I hope to learn to cope better...but somehow that path eludes me.  I'm not sure if any other career isolates you from the rest of the population to the degree that medicine does.  This is due to both the time commitment and military-style system of training. The hospital its own universe, and while many are content with being in that bubble, others like me are constantly looking outward, wondering what could be...I envy people young professionals with a normal life..those who can sit and enjoy a deep conversation at a local coffee shop about arts, literature, and music. I can't recall the last time I did that. :(  The upside to medical training is eventual financial stability, but medicine isn't the only stable career path. So my advice to you is to keep trying your best..I wish you the best of luck in the future."

I know, it's not easy or even fun to strike it on your own. Law firm jobs are highly overrated.  I used to work for a V 10 firm and I hated my life.  The work, the entitled clients, godawful partners, the hours, the support staff, I hated it all.  Medicine can be very similar in terms of stress, long hours and bureaucratic nightmare. The happiest doctors I know are family physicians who work 9-5, but they are not super rich either. If you are really passionate about medicine, you can still go for it.  You are not too old.

ABCDesis,34ysmh,get_real_quick,3,Wed May 6 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree it's tremendously helpful and supportive to have a partner who is behind you all the way, I think it's important not to look to a relationship to save you from what you're going through.  That's a recipe for dependency and unrealistic expectations.  Don't get me wrong, I'm really glad you met someone who helped you in your time of need...but in a vulnerable spot like OP is in, it could be the wrong advice to look for a relationship to ""fix"" things.  More often it's better to get your shit together on your own first, to be strong for yourself, and then you not only can be a good partner for someone else but you'll be more likely to meet the right person for you.  Desperation, depression, and loneliness can make us choose incredibly bad partners out of need."

ABCDesis,34zvyu,varunisonfire,9,Tue May 5 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"The thing is, he actually had a point buried under all the immaturity. It is true that in terms of dating, Asian men and Black women are considered the least desirable, and it isn't unfair to say that ""ivory tower"" feminists tend to avoid the topic of emasculation and stereotyping of Asian men for all their talk about ""intersectionality.""   That being said, he pulls this shit of ""well you know what I meant"" when called out on a statement that could have been taken another direction, instead of, you know, responding in some way like ""Very sorry, this is what I was referring too. This is what I meant to imply.""   @FeministaJones BUM   Ladies and genetlemen, the hope for Asian America.  EDIT: I later found out that right after that line in the interview, he mentioned something like ""I also go on OKCupid and no one wants to talk to me,"" to give context to what was said. Now I feel that those other users were just looking for something to get offended by or didn't pay attention to what was said. While that doesn't improve my opinion of how Eddie handled it later, the other side isn't exactly a bunch of blameless angels either. Also, misleading title. Makes it sound like he calls ALL black feminists bums, but he calls two people who happen to be black feminists bums. Then again, you gotta get clicks somehow, right? ;)"

I read through the who string of tweets , even the angry feminists didn't accuse him of racism, just variations of misogyny and sexism and le wild racism appears on the title because who wouldn't believe right?  Eddie had a point, they provoked him, twisted his arguments and then got offended. After all it's twitter, it can't be better than reddit.   Eddie doesn't have to agree with every Asian American.

All that has mostly stopped thanks to globalization reaching India. OTOH, some of my very affluent relatives act as though money grows on our backs even though they ought to know perfectly well that we're middle class. And they tend to forget that the cost of living in our part of the world is really very high.  And they're always pressuring me to shop designer goods and stuff in India. Like, cousin, I don't have €300 lying around to spend on a pair of earrings. And they always assume my parents will step up and pay. Because of course."

I ask the friends to tell me what they want and I ask them to buy it themselves online and have it delivered at my place. So an iPad or kindle are relatively easy to bring back home.

It's not like it's the '50s where India couldnt' manufacture anything. Now, literally everything is found in India. I wanted flax seeds, nice clothes, Gillette men's razors, and cologne. All this was found at the corner supermarket!  Oh yeah, you can even buy Toblerone there, and I'm not just saying from the airport, but at the aforementioned corner supermarket.  Heck, even a Chicago Bulls baseball jersey with 23 on it here in the USA is made in China! The same jersey can be bought in India!"
ABCDesis,34wasj,TaazaPlaza,3,Tue May 5 07:32:48 2015 UTC,"Actually the stuff is way cheaper in US than in India. Try and compare. There are no quality controls in India, so the made in China stuff is kind of the one rejected by US. The $5 shirt you buy in Walmart will be $15 in India comparing the quality. Levi Jeans cost the same. Even food in US is cheaper and quality controlled. Things like Cashew Nut (imported from India!).   Economies of scale concept is very much in favor of US!"

Of all the things we bring, the only ones you really can't get in India for reasonable prices are the variety of cheeses.  We're not really asked to bring things by the rest of the family, but we bring gifts anyway. Usually things like perfumes, purses, shirts (which usually end up being ones made in India or Bangladesh, and my grandfather will inevitably say we're ""carrying coal to Newcastle""), lipsticks or cosmetics.  Once we even took a small bicycle for my younger cousin (my dad dismantled it and packed it in a box), a window air conditioner (and a heavy duty 120-240V transformer that weighed 20 pounds to power it), and a microwave (with the settings printed in Russian) and crappy toaster oven that we bought at the overpriced 240V electronics store in an Indian neighborhood. This was back in the 90s when you still couldn't easily find these things in India.

It's becomes even more different if you are a person who identifies with the Muslim culture, whose parents grew up in India, and were born in the US. It all qualifiers of a different experience, and that is important.    To answer you question, I tend to identify more strongly with Muslim culture compared to just Indian culture, but Muslim culture in India is probably the best way to specify it."

I have only spent 3 weeks of my life in Bangladesh and it's difficult to have a deep bond with a country when you have spent such little time living in it. My grasp on the language has deteriorated as my Mum's fluency in English has increased so I would be like a duck out of water if I ever decided to live there. However I do always refer to myself as Bengali rather than British or English and I like to listen to my Dad's stories from when he was growing up in Bangladesh.    It would be interesting to see everyones scores with respect to the country they now reside in, my score for England would only be slightly higher.

ABCDesis,34w73y,Megalon1,13,Tue May 5 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"10.  Okay, maybe that might be an exaggeration. But maybe 8 or 9 in reality! But regardless...  I'm a 19 year old Indian-American who grew up here. Was born in Pune, but we left when I was only 5 months old. I speak my native language of Marathi as an ethnic Maharashtrian. And I am in the process of learning Bengali (what a beautiful language it is!) and am planning to learn Hindi and some Dravidian languages down the line too such as Tamil.  Although I am well comfortably within the society here even outside the Indian-American community with non-Indian Americans, and even have a US passport for a while, I sometimes feel that I am missing something. I always will feel like a foreigner. I do visit every summer and am familiar with it very well. And whenever we are driving on the Mumbai-Pune expressway that connects the two cities, I remember that this was a fantastically executed infrastructure project in India. This was the only project in the state of Maharashtra that has been untouched by corruption! I imagine, ""imagine where India would be if corruption was all gone!""  I honestly want to go back to India sometimes even though it has it's problems and do my best to combat them. After all, what did Gandhiji say?  ""be the change you want to see in the world""  The sad thing is that the India that he fought for hasn't seen this iconic quote for the most part. Sometimes after reading stories of bad shit going on in India, I say, ""Fuck. Maybe I shouldn't fuck with this. I don't think India will ever change!""  But then I am taken aback. I realize that EVERYBODY is saying this back home and those who escape India for a better life, which is why nobody solves problems there. It is a classic case of the bystander effect. ""It is not my problem is it?"" is what people say. ""Someone will fix it!"" But that someone never arrives!  But, the great news is that India seems to have a vibrant startup culture which seems great as hopefully one day I can use my capital gained by earning big bucks in the IT industry here in the US to set up shop in India to hopefully start that up. And then one day, I will do something for my country! But, I am afraid that greed will prevent me from doing so if business goes well!  But that said, there is no rule saying that if you are rich, you much be an entitled piece of shit!  I always was astonished by the fact that 36% of NASA's engineers are of Indian origin! That is HUGE! But what if they went back to India and worked for ISRO? Imagine where would we be! At the fucking top!  And we can change problems like bigotry in India, whether it is religious, linguistic, etc. Much of it is due to ignorance. Indians don't know much about India themselves! But we are Indians ourselves so we know how India is and can change our own nation by educating people about the different regions, languages, and cultures, etc. This bigotry is to an lesser extent in well educated households as I noticed.  I mean look at how strongly the British changed the fabric of Indian society? And the shit that they imposed is still engraved in India! (FYI. I don't hate the British people. I hate the people under rule in the UK at that time.) And they feel no remorse about the crimes against humanity they committed too! I was in London back in 2008 visiting the UK and at one point was looking at museum artifacts. I noticed that in the jewl and gold section, I read, ""origin: India"" everywhere! And it made me feel sad!  Now, what would I do to help my country? There are many possibilities and approaches to solving everything. Too much to state in what has become already a VERY long comment!"

We may be in diaspora, but this small diaspora is a powerful one!  The main issue is that instead of giving products to the world, we give services such as labor. This must change. The countries who make products are the ones most successful. We need to change the education system in India too to promote that."

And the problem is the people who are well off don't do anything even if they can (besides few exceptions). But there needs to be more of that.  First thing is that we must change the stupid societal norm of getting married and working at an MNC. Getting married isn't bad, but working for another MNC is. Since you are only stuck with a meager salary that you get paid. But stuff is looking good as the younger generation is liberalizing in India. And startups are being brought up too in the big cities.

I'm Muslim Pakistani but in my town there was a decent-sized Desi community (probably ~150 people), but <20 muslims total and only a dozen of kids within 2-3 years of me. Parents were typical fairly strict desi parents (no dating/girls, your only purpose is studying), though grew up fairly secular in terms of religion. Most of my friends were white and of various Christian backgrounds and my best friend growing up was Jewish, and I loved having religious discussions throughout high school and undergrad, despite me being a non-practicing muslim.   I don't renounce saying I'm Pakistani or anything that extreme, but I feel that living and growing up in the US has shaped me more than my heritage. I only know English, but intend to learn Urdu sometime. I don't care too much for bollywood movies/songs. I did join a Bhangra team in undergrad, where I was the both only muslim and brown kid who didn't know their native tongue, nevertheless it was a lot of fun and made some great friends. I also enjoy cooking Desi food. I'm not great, but I'm not too bad either. Most of my family is no longer in Pakistan, so I haven't been in over 10 years now, too, but I really want to go sometime in the next 2-3 years.  tl;dr I like cooking and eating Desi food, and used to do Bhangra, but other than that, I'm basically a slightly tan white guy.

Not because of any caste-superiority, I hasten to add, because I actually quite dislike Brahmanism itself.   On the other hand, like one of the other posters, I don't as much identify with the concept of India as such. Thanks to culture warriors Indian culture is constructed as being primarily North-Indian. I didn't grow up with North Indian culture AT ALL - I don't speak Hindi (though my parents do), no Hindustani music, etc. And I hate how even South Indians who have grown up in the North act all superior just because they consider themselves 'North Indian' now (and the South somehow inferior). So I don't identify at all with that aspect of 'Indian culture'.  I do wish to learn Sanskrit and further my knowledge of Tamil."

ABCDesis,34w73y,srs507,2,Wed May 6 07:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a 5. I'm surprised to see there're no other 5s here.  I've never lived in Pakistan. I haven't even been to Pakistan in more than 15 years. But I was raised to be Pakistani, which is something that used to be part of my identity, but isn't really anymore.  Though I say I'm a 5, it's just my self-assessment, most will think I'm less and some might want me to be more. I don't share any typical desi/Pakistani interests or behaviors. I'm not Musilm, not really religious at all; I know almost zero Pakistani people (though I know many desis), and I'm not really crazy about any of the cultural stuff. I like the food, but don't like it too spicy. I love the music and languages but it's not something that extends into my social life, it's just for me. No one really knows how I feel about it. If you have an idea of what a typical Pakistani is like, I'm not that.  But I'm still a 5. Though I'm the last person to see it, I look Pakistani. My family and parents are Pakistani. I grew up in an atmosphere of Urdu and Punjabi, aunties and uncles, and all that. The countless people in Pakistan with lives better and worse than mine sometimes seem so seamlessly interchangeable with me. One small difference and I could be them, they could be me. When shit goes down in Pakistan, it's not my problem. I'm not Pakistani anyway. But then, I wonder if I can really distance myself that much from it? Maybe I can do something about it? The thing is that I haven't always been a 5 but the more aware I become the more I recognize that I can't be NOT Pakistani. But Pakistan can easily be justified in disowning me if it wants. So ultimately, I can't really be any more than a 5 either. I am my own thing and I am Pakistani and I am American and I am Pakistani-American. I want to reserve the right to be more of one or the other, as I choose. I am American and no one can take it from me just as I am Pakistani and no one can take it from me."

On the other hand the value proposition for me isn't quite as attractive as it was either.   If I don't get to be the Chief, then I don't want to play Indians.   Well, you're definitely still a fan of hyper-patriarchy...   In my experience Indian girls are a bit slower to engage in intimacy than white girls, that part of the culture seems to still be in play. They have huge families and you're still expected to go see all her aunties and this and that. They definitely want to watch a bunch of Bollywood movies that I'd rather skip.   I guess that is a more nuanced version of your earlier point.   My problem is that first you (kind of) state that it is a positive development that women don't want to continue to live in hyper-patriarchy, but then you state that the negative consequence is that ""women have basically become like white chicks"". I mean, maybe not judge what women have become in such generalizing terms? I think that view is kinda distorted as well, it's a positive development that women are in charge of what they want and can decide what cultural elements they want to incorporate in their lives.  By then stating that because Indian women have changed, ""white is better"", you are also creating some sort of weird dynamic where one ethnicity is more preferable over the other...  But I guess we're all entitled to our views and I'm going way offtopic here."

Instead of being a big scary foreigner with a beard, I'm sort of preselected.    You definitely 100 % act upon the idea that white is better.    I like the idea of being able to give that to my kids too, perhaps they'll have social and financial opportunities that I didn't.

I have dark skin, I am proud of it and I think it could not be any more disgusting that you feel sympathy for that. It is proof that ultimately you believe that the whiter, the better.  The point is that NO ONE, especially not people of color, should experience feelings of being foreign or alien. The way to get there, is to strive for equality and to be aware of processes of supression and racism. Not by turning yourself into something you're not (meaning: white) or ""surrendering"" to hegemony/the dominant group (to say it more dramatically).   You are a product of white supremacy, and you are also sustaining it.   I think somewhere (?????) this is maybe coming from a good place but I'm done with this discussion now."

Life's tough, tougher so for someone who's not in the majority. We can be aware of processes of how racism works, as you mentioned, but that doesn't change that society doesn't work the way we want it to. I can hardly fault someone for wanting a better life for their children and not wanting to struggle in the way that we do."

ABCDesis,34uhkn,frackaracka,9,Mon May 4 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"If anyone wants to know what the curriculum proposed, here is what the Huffington Post stated:      In Grade 1, students should be able to identify body parts, including genitalia like the penis, testicles, vagina, vulva, and use correct terminology.      By Grade 2, students will outline the basic stages of human development, including an infant, child, adolescent, adult, older adult, for example, and related bodily changes. They will also identify factors that are important for healthy growth.      In Grade 3, students will be able to describe how visible differences (like facial features, body size and shape, physical aids or different physical abilities. for example) and invisible differences (like learning abilities, personal or cultural values and beliefs, gender identity, sexual orientation, for example), make each person unique. Students will also learn ways of showing respect for differences in others.      In Grade 4, students will describe the physical changes that happen during puberty for males and females — the growth of body hair, breast development, changes in voice and body size, production of body odour, and skin changes, for example. They will also learn about the potential emotional and social impact of these changes.      In Grade 5, students will identify the parts of the reproductive system, and describe how the human body changes during puberty. They will expand their vocabulary with words like cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, endometrium, and clitoris, as well as scrotum, urethra, testicles, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens.      Students in the sixth grade will assess the effects of stereotypes — including homophobia and assumptions regarding gender roles and expectations, sexual orientation, gender expression, race, ethnicity or culture, mental health, and abilities, among others. They will also propose appropriate ways of responding to and changing some of these stereotypes.      In Grade 7, students will touch on consent and the importance of having a shared understanding with a partner about delaying sexual activity, for example. They will go over genital contact, vaginal or anal intercourse and oral sex (including choosing to abstain from these activities). They will also go over reasons for not engaging in sexual activity and the concept of how consent can be communicated in a relationship. Grade 7 students will also touch on the understanding of physical, emotional, social, and psychological factors that need to be considered when making decisions related to sexual health, including STIs, pregnancy, desire, pleasure, gender identity among others. Students will also delve into areas of cyber-bullying, harassment and behaviours like sexting.      In Grade 8, students learn about all six genders including male, female, two-spirited, transgender, transsexual and intersex. They also cover topics of sexual orientation (heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual). When it comes to sex, students will learn about contraception and condom use for pregnancy, STI prevention, consent, and what it means to be in a healthy sexual relationship. For further development, Grade 8 students will also touch on the benefits or attractions of being in a relationship, along with drawbacks and risks like breaking up.      In Grade 9, students will be able to describe how to prevent unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. A further understanding of gender identities and issues around stigma, culture, religion, media, stereotypes, homophobia, self-image, and others.      Grade 10: Students should be able to describe factors that influence sexual decision making, including personal values, having limits, peer and family expectations, and myths and norms related to sexual activity or safe sex. Students will demonstrate an understanding of how to use decision-making and communication skills effectively to support choices related to sexual health. Discussions on misconceptions about sexuality in our culture, as well as what it means to be in a exclusive relationship.      Grade 11: Understanding a variety of mental illnesses and addictions including: eating disorders; major depression; anxiety disorders; psychotic disorders, and tobacco, alcohol, drug, gambling, gaming, or Internet addictions. Students in Grade 11 will cover proactive health measures like breast and testicular examinations, Pap tests, regular medical check-ups, stress management techniques, among others.      In addition to cyber-bulling, students in Grade 12 will also cover stalking, sexual assault, abuse within a family, extortion, and workplace harassment, for example. Further discussion on healthy relationships, developing healthy sexual relationships with others, and looking at relationships and stereotypes in the media.      Personally, I definitely agree with /u/GWmyc2... There is a need for increased education regarding sexual and reproductive healthcare. Kids end up ""learning"" about this stuff on their own, and unfortunately, due to untrustworthy sources, a lot of misinformation is spread. Teaching these topics in school would help address that and promote health and safety."

I can only wish I had such an comprehensive, inclusive curriculum such as this, including the aspects regarding gender and sexual orientation.  Though I never explicitly had ""the talk"" with my parents, it wasn't SUCH taboo in our household. My parents knew full well what was being covered in school and took a look at the materials we were given and were probably relieved that they didn't have to go in such detail themselves when the school was doing a decent job already. Parents had the option to withdraw their kids from the section of health that covered this stuff, but I can't remember any students (even the ones from stereotypically conservative backgrounds: Desi, Muslim, etc) not attending.  This is the same bullshit I hear about happening in India, regarding sexual health education. OMG ISCHOOL GOING TO TEACH THE SAX! No you ignoramuses, they're going to teach your children what is happening to their bodies as they grow up, to understand their feelings and that they're normal, the risks and rewards sexual activity comes with, consent and pressure, and that perhaps maybe they should wait until they're a bit more physically and emotionally mature before they engage in sexual activity."

How many Desi parents do you think had that talk with their kids?  This protest is the perfect example of a clash of cultures when you put a conservative minority group in a fairly liberal society.

But no, my parents never had any sort of sex-talk with me. My dad was shocked I knew what condoms were in 12th grade (!!!!!!!).  Do they think their kids are never going to have sex? Never be in a situation where this knowledge would be helpful? I would hope classes would cover things like consent and safe-sex etc."
ABCDesis,34uhkn,stripey_kiwi,5,Mon May 4 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"The sex ed curriculum I had in NY covered consent, safe sex, emotional health and a ton of other great topics. Obviously that was in high school but I know for a fact that my friends in Toronto never got that level of information.  This stuff really pisses me off. There are so many US born and raised people who don't know the physical, mental and emotional aspects to sex and make such bad fucking decisions. This topic should be as important as math and science."

ABCDesis,34uhkn,shannondoah,2,Mon May 4 19:52:55 2015 UTC,It is really important! I am thankful that my country has such wonderful sex ed. It taught me to know my boundaries very well and make informed decisions. It seems to me those are the two biggest problems with US sex ed.
ABCDesis,34uhkn,book-of-kells,3,Tue May 5 08:16:06 2015 UTC,"One of the parents was on the radio this morning. The obvious solution here is talk to your kids about sex! They are going learn about it whether it's from school, friends or the internet, at least let them learn from a credible source and if it's against your culture...talk to them about it."
ABCDesis,34uhkn,shannondoah,3,Tue May 5 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"This is an issue in my country as well. I live in one of the most socially liberal countries in the world. There is excellent sex ed in schools. Many educated Indian immigrants here don't want to integrate in the society and they often make bigoted comments about non-Indians and LGBT people. Yet they want to enjoy the fruits of this country (better and cheaper healthcare than most places in the world, cheap university education). They send their children to British or American or International schools and look down on the local schools because they are too liberal and have a corrupting influence (in their eyes). And the kids take over the superiority complex and treat the kids in local schools as inferior. But I digress..."

And then she shoved some books at me and told me only to read specific chapters. I read the whole thing, oops.  The closest I got to a talk with my parents was asking my dad to explain a diagram of the female hormone cycle in my Gr 12 bio book.

Usually, I just skim through such articles, but this one was so well written and there was so much I can relate to.   Thanks for sharing.    ""I stopped going to Muslim social gatherings after realizing that Pakistan-bashing would be a central theme in these. ""  and this part:  ""He is a bearded Muslim male yelling at the woman for attacking Islam. What I feel, strangely enough, is betrayal. I’m on your side, I want to tell him. I’ve been threatened with violence, spat on, yelled at, and called names for being a Muslim. If anyone in my classrooms abroad says anything derogatory about angry, misogynistic Muslim men, I don’t let them get away with it. My heart starts pounding and my hands and feet are cold. I respond by making fun of him, and I know that the sympathies of the room are with me. Now, I am angry at myself. He is a minority here by virtue of having a beard and he believes that something precious to him—Islam—is being attacked by me and he needs to defend it at all costs in a hostile environment. Don’t I know that feeling? The reason I retreated into silence about Pakistan when it was being attacked was because I knew that if I started speaking, I would sound exactly like him.""  ..  . oh my god- that's exactly how I felt when I was called a misogynist for pointing out their racism. This article is gold."
ABCDesis,34tzqa,pakiinbetweener,2,Mon May 4 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"A bit old, but I can't stress how good this essay is. The author very beautifully describes feelings and events I'm sure a lot of people here have had to deal with."
ABCDesis,34tzqa,Tipoe,2,Mon May 4 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"I've seen this article before but never read it through before. It was a great read. She has a way of describing certain things:  ""There’s a god who lives here in Pakistan, who used to be khuda around the time I left for college, but who is now Allah.""  By no means does this sentence summarize the article. Just thought this phrase was poignant way of describing just one aspect of Pakistan."

ABCDesis,34to6y,asdfioho,2,Mon May 4 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"It is tenuous, if you look at that way. However, one of their hypotheses is that Enlightenment has secularized Protestant ideas about many things: religion, state, etc."

You definitely don't have to get married immediately after college, so if you want to live on your own for a while, you can do that between graduating and getting married. It isn't that crazy to get married at 28 or 29 or later nowadays.   Start throwing hints at home about moving out on your own when you're graduated & have a job. I'm not sure how strict your parents are but if they can handle those hints, they might start to get used to that idea and it will be much more likely for you to go through with it.  There is not one path that you have to follow, it's much more about what you want for yourself independent of society intervening."
ABCDesis,34sbs8,pomegranita,7,Mon May 4 09:56:16 2015 UTC,"but I can't live alone before I'm married because I'm a girl    Well, yes you can :p They don't want you to, but you're an adult, so you can do whatever you want.  You could get a job to save up for PA school- and when you apply for financial aid, you mark yourself as an independent (as all post-bachelors students do), so your parents finances aren't in the equation.   edit: and if you really do want an arranged marriage, I agree with everyone else- you're putting too much pressure on your age. It's not abnormal at all anymore to wait until your late 20s, even in more conservative cultures."
ABCDesis,34sbs8,i_am_not_sam,3,Mon May 4 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"Whoa whoa. Firstly, there are no timelines for such things. Even if there were, that's way too early. I mean your parents probably disagree, but don't convince yourself too. It's not unusual for girls to seek arranged marriage in their late 20s since they want a career and it's acceptable in Indian society now.   So concentrate on your finals first, then tell your parents they you want to study and establish a career. Even with all that, IF you're on board, 25 is still fairly early to marry. So don't worry about it, figure out the important stuff first."
ABCDesis,34sbs8,TeslaModelE,5,Mon May 4 05:42:11 2015 UTC,I have Desi Muslim friends who got married in their late 20s and early 30s. No biggie. It happens. And yes they were well educated in the medical field.
ABCDesis,34sbs8,jesschechi,3,Mon May 4 12:08:59 2015 UTC,I feel the exact same way right now.
ABCDesis,34sbs8,Tipoe,2,Mon May 4 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"Is the 25 year old limit an Asian or American thing? Cause here most people get married late 20s or early 30s. Although I just realised the Asian population probably skews younger.   (PS: my Pakistani parents got married when both were at least 30, the pure horror)"
ABCDesis,34sbs8,bug-bear,2,Mon May 4 11:58:19 2015 UTC,"25 is absolutely not an expiration date. Take a deep breath, focus on what's going on around you now rather than what may or may not happen.   Has your family actually said anything to you (I'm going off of your post title), or are you going off of what you've heard them say about others? Sometimes (like in my family) my dad would make comments about my cousins or something being old, but when it came to me, his little girl had forever to get married.  My cousins are all older, around 30, single and successful women (working in the medical field, government, etc). They started living on their own after school. They get pressure from their family but they are happy on their own. They do go on dates and everything - when they feel like it. So don't think you'll be too old, it's not true at all!"
ABCDesis,34sbs8,x6tance,2,Mon May 4 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"Same as others mentioned. I have like, 3 close cousins who are in the medical field and got married in their early 30s. You'll be fine. You might have a few skirmishes with your parents, but ultimately, it's up to you!  It's becoming a common theme for women around 26/27 to get married. Even if you see others getting married earlier than that in your social circle, don't be disheartened. It's hard to accommodate for every part of this country."
ABCDesis,34sbs8,catvertising,2,Mon May 4 15:29:59 2015 UTC,A lot of my friends wait until their late twenties and early thirties to get married. My relative married in her early thirties to a guy in his late twenties. Welcome to 2015!

Get awesome grades, make memories with your friends, go on that girl trip you've always wanted to do.  But, it doesn't hurt to start looking in one or two years.  My friend met her boyfriend at 23, they were going out for a year, and after her graduation, she had one year of applications/waiting, and they got married in that time. So it can be nice because she was able to send her applications to places they would want to live.   My point is your parents are right that it's good to get married around 23/25, but they should dial down the panic a bit...if you don't feel ready for marriage, it will ruin it so it's better to marry when you're into it."
ABCDesis,34qoos,JenniferHewitt,17,Sun May 3 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"I get it. I'm closer to the other end of the spectrum, though.

Kids see me, though, and think I'm trying to be vain when really I don't care about how dark I am. I just want to avoid UV radiation.

The point is that the opinion of what men find attractive shouldn't be included in the conversation at all. Because it's not about what men find attractive.  edit: I'm saying 'men' because most of this fair-skin mania has mostly been aimed at women. I'm aware some guys go through this too, and it's the same deal- what women find atractive doesn't matter. Physical attraction isn't part of this."

Aunties will tell my mother (who used to be dark skinned but thanks to various skin bleaching products has left the dark side), in front of my sister and I, that I am prettier than my sister because I am lighter.

ABCDesis,34qoos,asdfioho,4,Sun May 3 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"In addition, why is sex taboo in modern Indian society? If you look at our ancestors, they were fucking going at it! Ancient Indians were quite open about sex. There is plenty of evidence to prove it. There are statues representing large-ass orgies too that even some of the most profound liberals in Northern Europe would be shocked to see!  Simple. The British. Now, it is true that the Mughals kept their sexuality preferences to their own people and they never overly imposed it like the British who tried to wipe out a lot of our culture with Victorian era morals, clothing, etc.  And the sad part is that much of the older generation actually thinks that this is our culture, which they are mistaking. True Indian culture should reflect liberal morals. Not conservative. And these who further go on to claim that they are Hindus with these beliefs, I just coin them as ""Abrahamic Hindus.""  This extends to stuff like Transgenders, Homosexuals, and stuff like weed as well. In fact, in Hinduism, weed is considered sacred.  I am not a super religious person nor do I want to be. But as an Hindu-atheist I love to learn about the subcontinent's past and interpret the religion that is still always a part of myself no matter of how much of an atheist I become.  For crying out loud, go to Nepal! That is where Hinduism and Buddhism has been preserved uninfluenced by Abrahamic religions. (Note: I don't hate Christianity and Islam at all. I am just writing this as a call to action to notify people of false Hindus.) Look at LGBT rights there aside other things. Nepal is much more liberal than India. They have never been invaded by the Mughals nor British. There is a strong correlation there!  Edit: apparently I heard that although homosexuals are highly protected by law in Nepal, in society they are not 100% widely accepted. However, definitely not as alienated as if he/she would be in India. And I noticed that there are mixed standpoints."
ABCDesis,34qoos,akbar-great_chai-tea,4,Sun May 3 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"The British certainly imposed conservative Victorian values, but I'm not sure your belief that [Hindu] ancient India is ""inherently"" liberal and should fit into modern western progressive values is any better....the statues of orgies are centuries, millennia old. Much has transpired in various South Asian cultures since then. Sikhs also do not value hyper-sexuality, nor do many of the Hindus that were between those temples created thousands of years ago and British rule. A lot of ancient Hindus were anything but liberal.   It's somewhat of a hypocrisy. On the one hand, when people call the Shivlings originally phallic-shaped, people froth at the mouth at how the British tried to primitize Hindus. Yet at other times we cite hyper-sexuality as one of the virtues of our ancestors that was suppressed by the British. I'm an anti-colonial all the way but at least pick a consistent narrative..."

ABCDesis,34qoos,sparksflyup2,19,Mon May 4 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Almost all agricultural societies have a preference for lighter skin over darker skin because darker skin is associated with sun exposure from low-class field labor.
ABCDesis,34qoos,dagp89,8,Mon May 4 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"It has varied with the times. Ancient Vedic works talk about fair-skinned being more beautiful because they considered other Dravidian origin ethnicities to be inferior. Later on, when people became more mixed, there were poems composed about the beauty of dark-skinned women. This actually doesn't change much during the Muslim period. However, in certain areas, fair-skinned ethnicities comprise an entire caste and the idea of ""fair is better"" developed there as part of casteism. A lot of this modern-day fairness obsession comes from Victorian ideals. Modern Indians idealize Victorian society without often realizing this. Hence, the fair-skin preference, talking about women being nicer than men to avoid talk about gender inequality and shabby treatment of the poor."

ABCDesis,34qtk5,energyturtle_ak,4,Sun May 3 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"This is cool, thanks for sharing.  I had no idea.  One point about ahimsa: there are different schools of thought as to what ahimsa really means.  I follow the interpretation of Sri Yukteswar (Paramhansa Yogananda's guru): ahimsa is about having a non-violent attitude, that it refers to a state of consciousness that intends no harm toward anyone or anything.  To see ahimsa strictly in terms of outer actions is to miss the real point.  One can outwardly be vegan and all that, but if inwardly they're still hateful, angry, and hold ill-will toward everyone, they cannot be said to have ahimsa and they are no more ""spiritual"" than someone who does eat meat but is inwardly kind.  St. Teresa of Avila, one of the greatest Christian mystics and saints, ate meat regularly without issue.  Christ taught: ""Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.""  That said, I do think vegetarianism or at the very least reducing meat consumption significantly is wise for the majority of human beings (edit: and for the planet).  Edit: I should also add that H.H. the Dalai Lama has also said that even for Buddhists, vegetarianism is not strictly required.  The key is whether or not the animal was specifically killed for you; if not, if they were already killed, you had no way to stop it anyway, and someone is offering it to you for your meal, there is no bad karma in eating it.  This is of course not a license to eat meat liberally, or to absolve a Buddhist from working toward the reduction/elimination of cruelty toward animals."

Never mind the billions of animals killed in the production of plant crops in the form of snakes, rodents, insects, and others that live in the complex eco-system of life. Yes. they are animals, too and they die. they just don't provoke the same emotional response that you get when you think about a furry animal being killed.  The reality is that life feeds on life. By all means, eat what you want and don't eat what you don't want. But don't delude yourself into thinking that your particular diet grants you some higher moral ground, because that's a galactically stupid self-delusion."

So vegans are not in the least deluded about the harm inherent in feeding the world.  http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat  Check out /r/vegan and you'll see we discuss this regularly. Veganism is about the practical reductions we can make to minimize cruelty and suffering. If all that mattered was not killing any animal ever than the only option would frankly be to kill ourselves and never have children. That is a lot to ask of anyone.   You know what is easy, reducing or eliminating animal products. Really not hard. You can find a wide variety of recipes that are delicious and nutritious.  I don't think my being vegan grants me any higher moral ground. Many people however fail to look beyond what the majority does, or what their meals demand. We simply can't feed the world on meat.

I could never have considered myself a jock growing up.  I loved to play sports, especially soccer but my parents like other desi parents never invested into that aspect of my development.  Last year I watched a documentary about Larry Bird and Magic Johnson that essentially changed my life.  I'm young so this is the best I got in terms of milestones.  For anybody that doesn't know, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are basketball players and they ignited my love for basketball.  Larry Bird's story resonated with me.  A no nonsense, tough, blue collar baller. His style spoke to me. The game was irresistible after watching him so I just started to play.  I practiced for 3 hours a day everyday during the summer.  There were five days last school year where I wasn't in the gym.  I'm not amazing, but I've come so far from where I had begun.  I took up weight lifting because I was tired of being pushed around on the court.  Seriously it is ridiculous how many life lessons basketball is teaching me.  Number one is hard work.  It will never cheat you and it will pay you back in full.  I'm learning about the beauty of technique.  I could wax poetic about this stuff forever.  Point is, from what I've experienced of Jock culture,  it really turns you into a better version of yourself.  It makes you strong.  I have a work ethic now folks and it's because I practice putting a ball into a hoop.  Who'd've known.  Sports are an art form.  There are so many great stories that are made within sport that express all facets of the human condition.  I just wish more desi parents would realize how beneficial athletics are.  Sorry for the wall of text folks.  TL;DR:  Became a baller and now the girls holler."

The problems with this cultural model are most apparent in Canada and UK, although big cities have the problem as well. I'm a pretty strong believer in integration, where you maintain your culture in many ways but adapt to the place you live in.   That said, this has been the model for thousands of years. Some of the most culturally diverse cities like Multan and Lahore in reality had less of everyone mixing and more of small pockets of individual religious/ethnic groups forming the city."

ABCDesis,34msrp,asdfioho,2,Sun May 3 08:53:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. Have you visited Brampton? It's a mini-Punjab. The Gurdwaras are enormous, the street signs are in Gurmukhi (Punjabi script) and English, most shops and businesses have Punjabi names or are solely inhabited by Punjabis, the politicians are Punjabi, they have a Punjabi radio, they can do big events like Nagar Kirtans (basically Sikh parades), most people are Punjabi, etc.. Most Punjabis like this, and I think it has benefits (the food is amazing down there), but I don't like it as a whole. It causes social problems overall, and even then the ""cultural"" aspect is lost in some aspects. I was talking with my aunt and uncle who live there and they were so impressed that I'm really involved in PUnjabi-Sikh culture (that I started keeping my hair, am very involved in Sikhi and Gurdwara, that I do Bhangra and enjoy speaking Punjabi and learning about the culture), and lamented that their son is sick of, hates, and has discarded Punjabi culture because ""It's so invasive in his life."" Meanwhile, I grew uup in a highly diverse but highly integrated community, where I was one of few Punjabis (there's still a substantial Punjabi community though) at school. This made me appreciate my heritage more and want to seek my roots as well as appreciate other people's.  That said, it's a difficult problem to crack. I am speaking from a place of privilege, considering richer communities are much easier to integrate than poorer ones, where people need community support. I am also not in favor of people completely ditching their communities when they ""make it"" and solely living in the suburbs without involvement. However, I do think there's a problem in how people believe ""mini-Punjab's"" or ""mini-Pakistan"" (especially relevant in UK) are positive things."

But I have visited U.K(not London)- only for a few days but felt like Desis assimilated pretty well. I mean I could see desis of every type, not just the  professionals I am used to in the U.S.   I think Punjabis in general are successful in being comfortable with their identity compared to desis from other parts. I speak this as a mallu with lot of ABCD cousins.

As a hybrid between an NRI and ABCD, I do think it's a bit weird, myself. Indians in America are interesting creatures in comparison to their other Western country counterparts.

Quite a few of us have spoken about being shamed for attempting our mother tongues when we were younger and how it affected our ability to speak it as adults. It's not that many of us don't want to, it's that we've been shamed into not speaking it and getting over that is a huge psychological hurdle."

ABCDesis,34ig2e,b_digital,1 point,Sun May 3 14:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my personal opinion, it's an epidemic. It's really sad how people are losing their grip with their respective South Asian culture. What's even sadder is how it's only downhill from here. I can only see future generations diluting. The Western World will never see them fully integrated as long the colour of their skin sticks out. It's how it'll always be. It's why Blacks who are Americans and lost their largely West African roots are still otherized and seen differently. Im not talking about the ones living in the more impoverished areas. I'm talking about the ones in my region who are doing well. Or how East Asian immigrants from China or Japan who are in the same boat as us are still seen differently. My thinking is that if the country I live in will always see me differently, I'm gonna make an attempt to be that different, lol! No point assimilating and losing my background just to never be able to assimilate fully.   The reason why many Desi folks are distanced from their culture is upbringing. They watch American TV, immersed in American pop culture, speak in American English in their primary years, and their parents aren't actively engaging their children in regards to culture. So, ultimately, what happens is that you lose touch with your language and some customs and traditions will start to feel weird.   But I do understand that there is a counter argument to how I feel. Basically, culture only retains in this world and it's not as important as being a good being, but more like an attribute...like your clothes being orange instead of maroon."
ABCDesis,34ig2e,x6tance,3,Fri May 1 16:23:38 2015 UTC,"Hm I think assimilation is natural. I am just surprised at the extent to which is happens in the USA. I don't know much about Canada or Australia, sorry. I never watched Indian television either when I was a kid and I did most of my childhood reading in Dutch but I still speak my mother tongue - in fact, I learned to read and write (though I really can't write). I guess I always wonder what accounts for the discrepancy.  I guess you psychologically feel the physical proximity to India, though."
ABCDesis,34ig2e,brandysnifter,2,Fri May 1 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"why is it sad? Why should people live the way YOU want them to live?  I don't speak my ""mother"" tongue or whatever. I sometimes wish I did, but in the grand scheme of things, it affects nothing. Honestly, only knowing English, if i could pick any other language to be fluent in, i'd pick spanish, because it's would be useful. Malayalam has zero benefit to my life.   I don't do the eating with my hands thing. I mean, yeah I'll eat all the breads with my hands, but the curry and rice is going to be consumed with a fork and knife because that's what's comfortable to me. conversely, I don't judge someone who does want to eat with their hands. It's none of my goddamn business.   It's funny how when Americans visit a foreign country, they are expected to go to great lengths to adhere to the local customs, but when people from other countries come to America any expectation of adhering to American cultural norms is considered a xenophobic rerjection of the foreign culture. It's certainly true with Indians in my experience. I've always found this brand of hypocrisy to be maddening."
ABCDesis,34ig2e,in_the_airoplane,0,Mon May 4 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"It's sad to me cause, it's subjective, lol! It's how I feel. My last paragraph is probably more aligned with your views.   To me, knowing Hindi and Urdu is crucial cause I can communicate many things much more effectively in those languages than I can in English. I have plenty of family and family friends that speak it primarily and it helps me connect. I guess it might help that the language is more intelligible than Spanish around the world. I can see why Malayalam might seem irrelevant to you.   The difference between America and a country like India is that there is no American race, unless you mean the nearly wiped out Native Americans that live across this land. The modern context of America is a land that is a home for any and every nationality. India is largely for Indians. Also, we have to put things in a political context in which America is usually the country pushing its ideals and values into other countries' business. We've seen this plenty in colonization.   Most of the cultures and customs are an amalgamation of European Whites watered down or slightly changed. As an Asian, it's just not me. You're obviously free to eat Indian food the way you see fit, mate.   Everyone has their way of living their lives, but, I value and see the good in my culture and prefer it over the ""American culture"". That's not to say that America has no good values, but, most of those values already coincide with my religion. I can't think of anything that stands out in American culture."

ABCDesis,34iuq4,darthrevan,2,Fri May 1 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"I've realized that, many times, the only difference between what people praise as courage and what they condemn as stupidity is just a matter of how things turned out.  So for others it's not the actions that mattered, only the results.  I've been taking some risks lately toward something I really want.  If it works out, people will say I was courageous.  If it doesn't, people will say I was stupid.  My conclusion?  For me it's that I tried at all that makes me courageous, not how it turned out.  This has totally changed my perspective on viewing others' actions.  I now respect anyone for just giving something a shot, even if it turned out to be a complete crash & burn, rather than only praise people whose actions turned out well.    I hope that makes sense.  My point is: I'm celebrating today because I've become someone who doesn't care anymore if people call me stupid for trying.  Those same people would've praised me if it had worked out.  So most people's criticism (and their praise) is ultimately meaningless."

ABCDesis,34iuq4,Tipoe,2,Fri May 1 23:34:52 2015 UTC,I agree with your last statement. I've been in that boat where people criticized me for taking a different path and then see them come back with praise when it worked out. This is by no means duplicitous on their end and it's human nature.   It's a liberating feeling when you recognize that most people's criticism is meaningless. This is where the fear of failure comes from and leads people to live their life by society's expectations instead of realizing their true potential. That ends up being very dangerous as it leads to a place where people forget about their true potential or are so scared to veer off the path that they settle in life.

The only people I haven't listened to on there are This Will Destroy You, Hey Rosetta! and the Cribs. I'm a huge Kanye stan, I've listened to ""Like Water for Chocolate"" way too many times, and I'm a moderate fan of The Strokes. I've been in love with the Arcade Fire for years, and while I've never actually seen Samurai Champloo, I've listened to Modal Soul a lot, and Lady Brown is one of my favorite tracks, ever.  Listening to the Cribs now, and I really enjoy them. They feel a lot like the Strokes. Don't think The Strokes have ever done any Spoken-Word-like-stuff, though.  I stick mostly to rap/soul myself, although I love this guy called Andrew Bird. He's more baroque, orchestral pop, and it's wonderful.  But in terms of who I generally listen to   Outkast The Heavy D'Angelo Erykah Badu Prince (well, trying, anyways) Lauryn Hill The Roots This Japanese band called Hinto Simon and Garfunkel   That's what I can think of off the top of my head.

ABCDesis,34hhl5,akbar-great_chai-tea,3,Fri May 1 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"That was a good read factually, though I differ with the author's interpretation. Pindaris weren't exactly freedom fighters waging war against the British. Pindaris were basically mercenary corps of the Maratha Empire, following Maratha troops on campaign, providing ancillary support and allowed to pillage the conquered lands whenever Marathas won the battle. Marathas didn't have the tax base to pay for their wars and so they depended on mercenary troops like the Pindaris who were only paid war booty and not salaries or jagirs like soldiers in the Maratha army.   I agree that most Thugs of the 18th and 19th centuries were probably erstwhile Pindaris who had the skills to pillage and loot but were not in service of the Marathas due to declining fortunes of the Maratha Empire in the early 19th century. The number of casualties were also most definitely exaggerated. However, they were a real menace and their menace to traders, wedding parties and other travelers is well documented even in vernacular literature. They were definitely not fighting any guerrilla war or putting up a resistance to the British. Since they didn't have guns themselves, they almost always attacked Indian travelers and left British merchants and soldiers alone."

Half the class worked random jobs like bartending or waiting tables, while the other half worked unpaid internships.  I somehow got super lucky and landed a job at a small law firm that paid $1500/week.  I was over the moon - legal job that paid $6k a month! I called my mom excitedly to inform her and after she found out what the pay was, she said ""Savitri Aunty's daughter is working for a more prestigious firm making $12k a month for an internship. This is so horrible.""  Geez thanks mom.   Anyway, I learned to stop caring about what my parents/extended family or other desi aunties think about my career.  I did exactly what I wanted.

Take it lightly. Don't get caught up in your Dad's words. You, yourself know how good you got it. Ask a random stranger and they'll be amazed, I bet even.   Your Dad just wants the absolute best for you and doesn't know how to express it. So he feels like if he tells you it's not good enough, it'll push you. You and I probably don't work that way and need ample of support and care. So, just laugh it off. Honestly. It seems so lame and simple, but don't take it seriously. And make sure your carefree attitude is visible. =)   I realized the moment these words affect you, it runs your self esteem and even if you accomplish big things, you feel like a failure and that's honestly just as big of a problem itself.

All of those statements used to upset me, but I actually see changes in Desi communities in the way they look at non-Desi Americans, especially with the younger generations. Unfortunately, I don't see any major changes among White peoples attitudes towards Black people. I mean, I got verbally abused for challenging a guy on his facebook status since he called for snipers to be deployed in Baltimore to deal ""with these hoodlums"". He literally called for the death of his own fellow Americans, but I don't think he saw it that way and neither did so many of his friends.  Did any of you guys have any of your white friends or acquaintances make black jokes with you thinking it was okay since you weren't Black or Hispanic and would be cool with it?"

While on the flip side, many White Americans act like a very very small percent of African Americans are ok, and even then they are an anomaly and probably got lucky.

Their experiences aren't taken into consideration when making public policy or introducing new products. The lack of representation can also perpetuate the inability of visible minorities to be elected to office. (less eloquently, you are less likely to associate certain races with leadership if you don't see them being leaders in society, and then less likely to vote for them, which leads to less of them being elected....etc etc)  For example, in Canada visible minorities account for approximately 20% of the total population, and that's a mix of people who are from various parts of Asia, Latin American, Black, African (my experience is these are two separate groups of people), First Nations etc. However only 12.3% of our politicians in Parliament and the Senate are visible minorities.  How well does that 12.3% of law makers (about 50 visible minority politicians) represent the 6.3 million Canadians who are non-white and have vastly different life experiences than the 360 white politicians? And I mean, yes there are certain things that are universal that transcend skin colour and ethnicity, and I'm sure politicians get advice from consultants, but is that enough? As South Asians we have different health needs. We have different familial obligations and situations. We have different experiences with immigration. We should be represented in health and educational materials and literature.  I could go on and on, but I think the bottom line is, representation matters. I always felt so alone as a kid because I was the only brown girl in the class. I didn't think I could wear regular clothes or make up because they were made for white people. I didn't think I could participate in certain activities because they were meant for white people, etc etc. And to be honest, sometimes I still subconciously feel that way, and I wouldn't if I saw more people like me represented in politics, business and the media."

We need to realize that we are not the majority of the population and that the representation often represents the population. Are there too many minorities in politics? No? Well, get yourself a law degree or political science degree and try to change it.

No, but there are ways to go about and chance perceptions and expectations.

Wonder if there is merit to the reasons, because the people behind these types of discussions in India are by no means dumb and are some of the sharpest minds any where in the world.  However, none of these decision makers are doing themselves any favors because the so called 'reasons' seem extremely vague and ambiguous to say the least. They need better message management to avoid coming across as saying 'Marital Rape is OK'."
ABCDesis,34e7t5,akbar-great_chai-tea,14,Thu Apr 30 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"The reasons they pointed out will sound valid to anyone who has lived in India. Most people in India don't actually know the meaning of consent. They equate it to force and violence and don't understand that lack of consent can exist without physical violence. Since physical violence is already covered under domestic violence laws, most constituents of these politicians are probably perplexed as to what marital rape actually means.  Regarding their PR, they are talking in the language that their constituents can understand. They don't frame their language for the international media.  A very important point mentioned by someone over on r/india is that marital rape, if you define rape by the definition of consent, is something that happens to a majority of women in India in arranged marriages. This is an expected scheme of things and people, men or women, don't realize that this is even immoral, forget about illegal. Most of those women who are raped will not term their marital rape experience as rape at all."
ABCDesis,34e7t5,akbar-great_chai-tea,7,Thu Apr 30 19:34:17 2015 UTC,I agree with your last point. Don't so many of these women genuinely believe they're obligated to sleep with their husband if he wants to? Maybe I'm ignorant but I'm sure the more conservative arranged marriages lack good communication about sexual issues.
ABCDesis,34e7t5,Bustcratch,8,Thu Apr 30 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they do. And their husbands aren't necessarily evil either. Both parties have been socialized to think that this is the way it should be.   When the government talks about illiteracy and lack of education, they are talking about a real issue. In the absence of formal education, most people's ideas have been shaped by traditions. When traditions are messed up, formal education needs to replace it. But till that time, it's unfair to expect these people to fall in line with modern ideas of those who are lucky enough to access modern education and ideas."
ABCDesis,34e7t5,akbar-great_chai-tea,8,Thu Apr 30 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"Great points!  Edit: Upon thinking about this more, while what you are saying is valid, I am afraid the way you are saying it frames the discussion in a Western context and comes across as condescending towards Indians. Let me explain...  When you say ""Most people in India don't actually know the meaning of consent."", it paints Indians to be ignorant and too simplistic to comprehend the concept of consent. Any human in the world understands consent, but they may have a different concept of consent in their own cultural/societal context. In the Western world, consent for sexual relationship needs to be obtained each and every time and can be withdrawn at any moment, even while in the midst of the act (and sometimes even after the fact). The Indian version of consent for marital sex, as it stands today, is a one time yes/no question which is put to the female when getting married. Saying yes to the marriage is saying yes to (non-violent) marital sex for as long as you are married. It is enforced via concepts like 'wife's duty', etc., that privilege the men over women, but that is a pervasive issue with traditional societies.  The other statement you made that gave me a pause was: ""men or women, don't realize that this is even immoral, forget about illegal"". Again morality is not rigid - current Indian definition for what is immoral for wife includes refusing marital sex with husband. This will change as society changes, but I don't know if one is better than the other without taking into consideration the broader context of impact of free will and personal agency of females on society at large. Females need to take one for the team is an entrenched thought in the Indian society..."
ABCDesis,34e7t5,Anandya,11,Thu Apr 30 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think consent is very widely understood by most people. Even in the US, there has been major backlash to the idea that ""enthusiastic consent"" needs to be there for sex to not be considered rape. Most people still conflate lack of consent to violence or at least a threat of violence.   The difference is that when the media or activists try to popularise the notion of consent as separate from violence, people in the US and other developed countries have the tools to process that information. Many people will still have a half-baked understanding of the concept and will simply go with the flow but they will have access to tools to better their understanding.  That's not the case in India. Very few people are equipped to talk about sexual consent at all. People have barely stopped thinking of rape as an attack on a woman's honor instead of her dignity and personhood. Choice, consent and rights are advanced concepts for most societies to process. In a society with relatively less literacy and even fewer educational tools, it's well nigh impossible. In that case, legalizing a modern form of consent will just be an imposition, not a choice of the people."
ABCDesis,34e7t5,RotiRoll,3,Thu Apr 30 20:48:21 2015 UTC,This is no different from the west though. People still are puzzled.  Hell my girlfriend still is amazed I ask her during sex....

In a place where women are largely dependant on their husbands to be bread-winners what happens when those husbands get locked up after being prosecuted for rape? Who is keeping the kids provided for?  Sadly, India has to make up some serious ground in terms of the status and opportunities afforded to women as well as the resources available to poor women and children before they can even afford to start enforcing this.   Of course, rational concerns about unintended consequences and feasibility never seem to come up with other hare-brained schemes like a rural employment guarantee, so it's a little annoying that it comes up here."

The biggest human rights issue in India is not religious violence or woman's rights, but actually the economy. Millions and millions of people suffer from the worst kind of abject poverty on the planet - it's really the stuff of nightmares and it breaks my heart every time I visit. India is only slightly better off even compared to Africa.   Improving the economy isn't the most direct way to fix that, but it is the only stable, reliable way to lift people out for good. China took five hundred million people out of poverty in just a few decades. It did this in spite of committing many human rights violations: crackdowns sanctioned by the state such as Tianneman, murdering thousands of political dissidents in black prisons , ethnic cleansing of cultures in Xinjiang and Tibet. Yet, I doubt anyone would say that what the CCP accomplished was anything short of a miracle and good for the country. It gives them the education, free time, and just enough damn calories to deal with these bigger issues.  It'd be wonderful to have an effective government that was also secular and good on every human rights issue, but if Modi can pull off a fraction of what he accomplished in Gujarat economically, he will be saving millions of lives and improving tens of millions more. I am sure that Rahul Gandhi would not be able to accomplish such a feat, which meant four years of him doing nothing could result in the relative loss of life and livelihood of millions.   And if Modi actually manages to shake india up economically as much people hope he will, then he might just save 10s or even 100s of millions people. Unless he starts actively going after Muslims(the comparisons to Hitler are a tad premature), that's more than enough to earn him my support.  From what I've heard, the worst that can be said about him was that he was complicit in not stopping riots started by Muslim protesters - which is nothing compared to what many other leaders - now revered - allowed to happen on their watch.

I've searched for the name of my grandfather's village and found no results. I wonder how much of a connection he retains to that place, and if he ever had the desire to visit again after permanently moving to India, because there are so many difficult memories too."

It places undue pressure on the child to constantly perform, and links their self worth to academic performance.  Children labelled as gifted when young find it harder to explore new activities that don't come easily to them for fear of failing and thus not living upto their label.

ABCDesis,34e8i7,Megalon1,3,Thu Apr 30 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's a great watch out! We have been careful not talking about the 'gifted' program. Even the test, we told him was to decide whether he needs to be in Scratch or Scratch Jr., didn't clue him in that it was a sort of entrance test.  I also am observing that the kids, at least at his age, don't really care about these tags. They are just having fun making the computer do what they want it to do - it's the parents that seem to be getting tied up in knots."

ABCDesis,34e8i7,dreams-in-cmyk,4,Thu Apr 30 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of this has been said in this thread but I just thought I'd add my experience. The TAG (talented and gifted) program in my school district often had better and more involved teachers (many of whom affected my education long after I left their classrooms), but this isn't always the case. Being labeled as ""gifted"" opened a lot of opportunities in middle and high school because in terms of advanced classes, honor societies, and having access to a group of smart students who shared my same priorities.  My parents told me two things when I entered the program. First, they were not going to pressure me to get all As (given the rigor of the classes) as long as I sought help when I needed it. Second, I could drop out of the program, or drop down a level of classes (my school had three tiers of classes at each grade level, gifted, accelerated, and regular) as long as I wasn't quitting because I was lazy. This was probably the best thing they could have done because I started to push myself to do well and never felt that they were forcing me to be ""gifted.""  Also, as someone who ended up majoring in a creative field, I felt like the gifted program didn't focus on the arts as much as I would have liked. Luckily I went to a high school that emphasized english and history, but I wish I had had more arts in my life (although my parents put me in piano really early and I still play regularly).  Obviously these experiences are based on an in-school gifted program, but hopefully they're helpful!"
ABCDesis,34e8i7,IndianAmericanteen,2,Thu Apr 30 15:18:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing that - feels like a good level headed approach all around.
ABCDesis,34e8i7,serenissima_regina,6,Thu Apr 30 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"""Gifted child"" present, I am currently in high school, and I am considered ""gifted"" because I am a year ahead in school, and on top of that almost all my classes are college classes and I am a year ahead in most subjects on top of being a year ahead already. But, anyway don't tell them that they are ""really smart"" , it tends to give them an overly inflated ego and makes them lazy when it comes to studying in the future. Keep them grounded and do stuff through your school, this will help your child. For example, at my district all elementary kids take a test to see if they should be a year ahead in math, and later on they tested to see if they should be a year ahead in science. English and social studies. Get your child involved in these things, as for the programs I can't tell you from my own experience, since I was just told to study a lot, all the time. Breaks, Summer vacation I studied at home none of these programs, so I don't really think they are useful, if you can teach them yourself. Also play sports with your child, I have been a part of my varsity tennis team since 10th grade, and used to play field hockey in middle school and it's because my parents made me study but also had me play sports. So I love sports as well."

ABCDesis,34e8i7,asdfioho,3,Thu Apr 30 13:08:45 2015 UTC,Thank you - it gets so confusing a lot of the times.
ABCDesis,34e8i7,frackaracka,4,Thu Apr 30 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"I was (am?) supposedly gifted.  So my take on this is that public school (even a good school) isn't particularly difficult or rigorous. If indeed your child is gifted, he/she will be probably bored.  I viewed the ""gifted"" label as awesome, because it allowed me to take more challenging classes, so that the endless endless boredom ended. I also dealt with the boredom with pranks and fights, so the ""gifted"" label transformed me from the ""local she-thug"" to ""smart kid."" So it spared me going down the ""problem child"" track.  That being said, a lot of the ""supplemental"" programs outside school (and offered for $$$) aren't really academic or intellectually challenging. They're more geared towards allaying parental anxieties about the future, and making the kid feel good.  My advice: ask your child. Some kids would rather do math than athletics. Some would rather do arty stuff. I still love nerd stuff and art and I still hate sports (other than dance). It's more important that your child doesn't feel coerced and is being intellectually stimulated.  I know there's all these fancy pedagogies but what I've seen works is the following: rather than enrolling your child in activities upfront, keep books, educational materials, nerd stuff, art materials, sports equipment in the house. (Givem how much activities cost, this is also the cheap route.) Tell the child about what the various things are, let the child experiment, and if the child wants further instruction go sign up for structured activities. There's a benefit to forcing the child to be creative and self-motivated, rather than presenting everything in the world in the form of neat lessons."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,KaliYugaz,3,Thu Apr 30 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"I'd just encourage them to learn on their own instead of jam packing their day with things to pad a college resume 15 years from now. Make sure they know their shit, but beyond that socializing etc... Is just as important if not more."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,immilaw,2,Thu Apr 30 21:16:28 2015 UTC,"I was a gifted child, all it meant was that I was placed with other gifted children in classes that were designed for us. I think it was great because we were all intellectually on the same level, so we could be normal kids with each other without getting bored or slowed down by other students in the class.  The downside, like /u/zoecat mentioned, was that once I started defining myself as ""gifted"" I felt immense pressure to perform well. Bad grades were like a personal attack. I'd suggest emphasizing hard work over intelligence so that your son doesn't internalize negative self-worth whenever he fails at something.  Also, if the program is focusing on STEM then I highly suggest getting your son involved in the arts. Doesn't have to be music, it can be anything else (painting, drama, etc.) That might also help him stand out in the long-run when it comes to college admissions."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,immilaw,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:54:48 2015 UTC,Great watch out on the pressure.   The other thing I was wondering about is any situation that sets up a selected/chosen/special people results in that group not being able to relate to anybody outside of that rarefied air. Does it create hurdles in terms of socializing/collaborating/relating with others down the road?
ABCDesis,34e8i7,bug-bear,2,Thu Apr 30 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"This is so, so, so, true; even at elite institutions, I've seen that although a lot of people are ""liberal"" in the political sense they're highly elitist and completely disenfranchised from working-class folks. My grandfather on the farm told my father before he moved to America for IT to never forget his roots, and it's something my family really prides ourself on."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,frackaracka,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"I had trouble socializing with other kids, but I don't blame being ""gifted"" so much as I do the fact that I started school early and was developmentally a year younger than my peers. Intellectually we were on par, but emotionally I lagged behind. On the other hand, perhaps because I learned through trial by fire I was able to improve my emotional intelligence, haha.  I wouldn't worry about being unable to socialize due to being gifted. If anything, the gifted program will help your son socialize because with the ""slower"" children he may feel unappreciated or even bullied for being ""different"". And there are tons of other things that can prevent your son from socializing with others (like cocooning himself with other insular Desi kids)."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,bug-bear,2,Fri May 1 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"1) Is there anything to this 'gifted child' stuff?   The idea behind segregating ""gifted children"" is that highly intelligent children with advanced abilities need to learn at a different pace and need to be taught in a different fashion in order to properly cultivate their natural talents. Failure to do so will apparently lead to boredom, irritation, and acting out. The consensus appears to be that this is borne out by solid evidence, though I'm not an expert in this field.   Were you a 'gifted child'? What did you think of being characterized as such?    Yes, I displayed academic talents (more liberal arts than STEM though) from an early age and was one of the first people in my district to become a member of the G/T program. I feel that I had a better school life as a result of being grouped with fellow G/T kids who were themselves highly intelligent and who shared and understood my nature.   An intelligent child will do well regardless of admission to a specific program as long as they are given the proper enrichment. The main draw of the GT program itself, IMO, is the networking with other, similarly exceptional children and families.   Am I being too typecastingy thinking like this?   Athletics is also important. Many G/T kids in my school excelled in sports and music as well as academics."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,asdfioho,2,Thu Apr 30 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting post.  I am curious to know how others feel about this. My husband, like you, thinks that our future kids' extra activities should be sports, music, dance or art.  According to him, if the parents are fairly intelligent or educated, and if they can spend time enriching their kids' academics, that's all they need.  He thinks gifted programs are too stressful and encouraging kids to be well-socialized is more important than just stellar grades alone."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,dosalife,2,Thu Apr 30 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"I used to think that and I still want to think that, but what's happening is my son is finding it to be a chore to spend 6 hrs every day at school. It has gotten so bad that each day he gives me three things that he hates about going to school (all are some variations of it's boring) and I have to make up for those three things with three other things that he enjoys that we do together. I don't mind that at all, as stuff that he enjoys also happens to be things that my wife and I find interesting, but I can't help but wonder if we should somehow enhance those 6 hrs at school.   His teachers are trying to help by putting him on differentiated learning track, but that's again 'gifted student' type stuff that comes with its own drawbacks, it feels like."
ABCDesis,34e8i7,dosalife,2,Thu Apr 30 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"If your son is bored at school, I think considering the gifted track might be a good idea. I think my husband's parents enrolled him in a bunch of activities and let him choose what he wanted to purse further. He enjoyed programming/tinkering with computers and ended up  enrolling in summer computer camps/programming for high schoolers, eventually turning it into his career.  But he also got to take Tennis, Soccer, Judo, Guitar, Piano, Ice Hockey (Russian parents lol) and Creative Writing lessons outside of school.  Honestly, I think my husband is biased.  He works in tech and is surrounded by brilliant yet socially awkward people, most of whom are Desi or Asian.  I think he is secretly worried that forcing kids to excel only at academics like many Desi and Asian parents, will result in the kids growing up to be lonely adults who struggle to form friendships and relationships.  You and wife seem to be providing a well-rounded childhood for your son.  As long as your don't pile on the pressure, extra academics seem to be a good idea.  That said, I am not a mom yet,  so take my advice with a grain of salt!"

Start the gifted/advanced classes early and hopefully he'll be taking AP classes in highschool, etc. I would do the gifted stuff at his school, at least. Beyond that, really pay attention to if he's interested in it. If he is, no harm in letting him do the extra things. But, if he'd rather be playing soccer or doing art, don't force him into something he's not interested in (and same the other way - if he's interested in 'nerdy' things, don't force him into athletics - he'll be miserable).  I guess, most important to me, is remember he's just a kid. It's okay if he wants to try a bunch of different things.

ABCDesis,34cy3a,arjun10,4,Thu Apr 30 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"Lol c'mon now you gotta brush up on your South Asian history!  Buddha was originally a Hindu prince, and Buddhism was (if I recall correctly) at first seen as a major reformist movement in Hinduism.  So its pretty unsurprising that you are seeing a lot of parallels with Hinduism.  Likewise if you look at some modern Hindu narratives, you'll find that some sects consider Buddha to be a reincarnation of Vishnu (the ninth, I think).  Many of my relatives in India have statues or pictures of Buddha hanging around, even though they are devout Hindus."
ABCDesis,34cy3a,asoons,2,Thu Apr 30 06:09:52 2015 UTC,"hinduism as we know it now didn't exist during the buddha's time. most of the modern hindu sects, as well as their predecessors, were formed after the buddha's time. buddhism influenced some major early hindu traditions, with the latter either outright appropriating or adapting certain buddhist doctrines and practices. there are scholarly works surveying buddhism's influence on the later upanishads and even the gita. brahmanism was around during the buddha's time, but jainism was also a major contemporary tradition. the buddha studied under jain teachers, and his teachings reflect the influence of that religion much more than that of brahmanism. but, with respect to both religions, the buddha dedicated some of his discourses to refuting their doctrines, or to taking concepts and practices important to them (like dharma, the fourfold division of society, what it means to be a brahmin, uposatha, rituals involving fire, etc.) and redefining or satirizing them to assert the truth of his own teachings."

On your point about Buddha being reincarnation of Vishnu, are u familiar with the mystics in Bali? They also apparently claim that during serlamatan (a ceremony in Indonesia where you have a communal feast, invite your neighbors, family, thank God), you once saw Mohammad present as another form of Vishnu, a human manifestation of Vishnu and he brought the Koran to the ceremony. Traditional muslims vehemently disagree with this, and rightfully so, but mystics and Keshawans (they are muslims, but traditonal muslims, the santris, dont consider them as muslims) believe that Mohammad was once manifested as Vishnu. This is so interesting to me, and I wonder how it all ties together."
ABCDesis,34cy3a,kenzowarsaw,2,Thu Apr 30 06:38:58 2015 UTC,"My perspective is that there is a component of the human experience that is unlocked through meditation, ritual, or chemical means. This experience occurs on a psycho-emotional-physiological level and it so powerful that it is completely unlike our everyday experiences. It's a feeling of pure sensation and connection that goes beyond words. Some would call it a religious experience, ego death, transcendence, or an epiphany.   Theoughout human history, when people have experienced this sensation, they have used words and descriptions to share with others the experience. But like I said before, the experience itself exists beyond words, and if you've studied semiotics you'll know that words are merely signposts to a deeper meaning. From the symbols chosen in various cultures arose varying traditions, each with their own rich interpretations of the experience.   I once read that our ancestors had a closer experiential link to that spiritual world. We live in a different age. One in which, for the most part, all we've been left with are the symbols and interpretations.  In the case of Indonesia, an area which has been influenced for hundreds of years by Muslim culture and thought, and before that by Hindu culture and thought, it makes sense that the people who partake in those rituals would come to a sort of syncretic blend of the symbols of both cultures."

At some point in history, Hinduism became socialized into what it is today.   I practiced Vipassana Meditation at some point in my life, and it was interesting to learn that this practice originate in India but died out and spread to areas like Tibet. But now, people are trying to bring it back to its place of origin. It's pretty interesting to think about this and speculate how social and political movements influenced the identity of Hinduism.

At the end, she says she recognizes that people are different, but with her article, she's basically saying, ""all these things that happened to me will happen to you. Beware of scary India!"" She had a shitty experience but her experiences don't show the ""ugly realities of being a woman in India!"" Yes, there is sexism, but her huge generalizations are terrible! I'm so angry right now that I'm having a hard time expressing how upset this makes me. Her unexamined privilege is frustrating!

I honestly have never had an issue wearing western clothes in B'lore.  I have been groped a lot, but that has happened to me regardless of what I wore, a salwar kameez or shorts.  I am not denying that India can be unsafe for women.  This woman's stories are way exaggerated though. No going out after 7? Again, ridiculous. Even with the dress code, I saw women wearing jeans and tops EVERYWHERE, there is no reason that she was ""forced"" into desi clothes."

ABCDesis,34a50e,serenissima_regina,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:02:55 2015 UTC,Yup. My experiences were similar at MG Road and Commercial Street too. What makes it sad is that they are known to be the more upscale areas in B'lore.

ABCDesis,34a50e,serenissima_regina,8,Wed Apr 29 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can get behind the train claiming that this woman is exaggerating or lying. This line of thinking is getting dangerously close it ""oh she should be quiet, she is making us look bad.""  I've been told exactly the same advice. I'm planning a work trip for a similar job, and yes, the advice for a foreign woman, living alone, in an rural area, is more or less what she reports. (She mentioned that she was in a small area to work at the mental health clinic.) When you are alone, rather than with family, and in a community that doesn't know your family, it's easy to be viewed with suspicion and hostility. It's a little bit better in big cities and tourist areas, but that's not where the author was.  From my experience, there's a range of harassment levels, depending on where exactly in South Asia you are. I don't want to start fights, but there's definitely places with a worse harassment problem than others, and it's totally possible she went to one of those places.  Also, unfortunately, the harassment level does depend on what you look like and what exactly you are wearing and how you carry yourself. If you, for some reason, look or act unusual, harassment does get a lot worse. One of my Indian friends, who is very voluptuous (she's more or less built like Christina Hendricks), is basically harassed nonstop no matter what she wears. Appearing foreign or American can indeed make you a target also. Maybe these are also reasons. After all, she claims that she was about to go out in a top that showed sideboob, something I would never ever ever ever ever try to do in India, suggesting she really doesn't understand the customs very well.  EDIT: What she's leaving out, is that when you go for work purposes, and you're in a position of trust and authority, your dress code gets much stricter. You might be able to pull off shorts if you're there on vacation. But if you're trying to convince rural people that mental illness is a thing, yes, you do everything to make yourself seem sober and traditional and trustworthy. Which means that you live like a nun, or your entire message is going to get derailed by your clothing or lifestyle choices."
ABCDesis,34a50e,akbar-great_chai-tea,12,Wed Apr 29 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you are saying.  It's not easy living and working in India and the lack of safety is the single biggest reason why I would not live in India.  When any non-desi woman asks me about traveling there, I give her the usual lecture on safety and modesty.  That said, I think she is doing a piss poor job of describing the real problems in India and her sweeping generalizations don't help anyone.  I used to live in West Philly when I went to college.  The area was low-income and shady as hell.  I was robbed once and my apartment was burglarized twice.  I did not rush to an Indian newspaper and churn out an article discussing ""The ugly realities of living in a black neighborhood.""  The author worked in a mental health setting and had the opportunity to discuss many real issues that affect women. Instead she focuses on issues that strictly subjective, many as result of her own idiocy and merrily sterotypes away.  Let's take a look at some of her points.   Dress code - She admits that she was told to wear shapeless, loose clothing, yet she packed low cut side boob showing clothes and complained about being chastised.  On my first day of work at a law firm, I was told by HR that my skirt was too short. I realized that it was true and in a conservative work environment like law, I needed lower hemlines and covered up shoulders.  It's common sense to dress according to your corporate/social culture. She hated having a bodyguard - Again, she complains about being harassed by men on the street, yet she complains about having someone help her navigate the language and society.  This is also not indicative of realities in India, most women don't get to have bodyguards. The creepy uncle - yeah this was super creepy and gross, but there are creepy men everywhere. One man's behavior does not impute to all of desi men. Judgement about arranged marriage - she complains that men look for ""height, weight, skin color, caste etc.""  Men in the US/other countries do the same.  I have seen online dating profiles where men want no fat chicks/girls who have went to college/have a career/no kids etc.  Arranged marriage is not the same as forced marriage.  Let's make fun of the guy who likes pets disregarding the fact that, to most Americans, not liking their pets are automatic dealbreakers (including myself). Her ordeal booking a ticket - Is this because she is a woman or because she is not Indian? I can't get anything done in India while my mom, who is also a woman can get everything done.  She knows how to yell at them, threaten to fire them or refuse to pay the hotel room bill if the room was dirty.  Most Americans who are used to smooth transactions can't deal with it.  It's messed up for sure, but being non-desi has more to do with than than being a woman.   This woman ignores the true realities for women in India like lack of education, reproductive health care, lack of mental health care, lack of financial independence, skin color discrimination, dowry etc.  It's a shame that she chose to spout the same old, all Indian guys are creeps blah blah. So much for learning about the culture."
ABCDesis,34a50e,Hot4_TeaCha,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with what you're saying too.  I don't think she said that ""all desi men are creeps,"" it's various commenters which are saying it. The author is saying that there is a different level of harassment and sexism than in the US, which is, objectively true. Which isn't to say that the US isn't sexist.  That being said, it's not well written, and she doesn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed. (Exactly where in the world would you pack sideboob outfits for a work trip as a translator for a mental health service?)   This woman ignores the true realities for women in India like lack of education, reproductive health care, lack of mental health care, lack of financial independence, skin color discrimination, dowry etc.    Doing what I do, I agree with you - in strictly statistical terms they are the issues most pertinent to women in India.  At the same time, mainly because I have a lot of NRI friends, I do hear another viewpoint - that of the female educated upper-middle-class, who went through the same training as me, but work in India. And honestly, the most consistent complaint is about drastic increase in misogyny and harassment and hostility, especially towards young, single female professionals. After all, the explanation usually offered for eve-teasing is not that the men are horny, but because they view themselves to be fighting ""un-Indian women with Western values"" and punishing ""wayward women,"" who are wrongfully ""taking jobs men should have.""  While Indian culture is very education-centric, and thus seems to adapt well to the idea of well-educated and accomplished women, it's very uncomfortable with idea of women unattached to either father or husband, as single female professionals often are. They get a lot of scrutiny, and have to be very careful about dress and behavior to still be taken seriously, much more than young men have to be.  It's important to educate women, and give them reproductive control and independence and financial stability. But at the same time it's important to create a culture where women aren't harassed or scrutinized for successfully gaining those things. South Asian culture is great at education, and great at acknowledging that women can be intelligent. But there needs to be a big attitude change regarding how to treat young women."

Lots of vague ""You can't keep me down"" to more direct ""S(he) cheated on me"" posts coupled with status updates reflecting their new single-hood.

I use social media only as a platform for what I would want EVERYONE, the whole world to see- and that's very few things.   Yeah, the girl I knew that got divorced- she had a long history of...let's say, choosing a new boyfriend before she informed the previous boyfriend that the relationship was over. When she got engaged, we thought, finally, she's realizing how to act in a relationship! but the same thing happened with her marriage too. The marriage lasted all of six months (though they had been dating for four years before they got married!) and she announced her divorce with a long-winded facebook status, asking people to provide support and not spread rumors, etc. Three days later, she changed her relationship status to being ""in a relationship"" with her new boyfriend.   @__@"

I went to work yesterday for an hour, but left because there were rumours of afternoon violence and I did not want to be there. Downtown and my workplace are full of different police forces (campus police, Baltimore police, state troopers, and national guardsmen).  Work, schools, and universities were closed yesterday, and while the situation was tense with all the police and military presence, I couldn't help but notice it was a beautiful spring day -- sunny, quiet, and peaceful. My building was under semi-lockdown, but I'd have stayed inside anyway because I was sick and burdened by allergies.  Today was also peaceful, and a normal workday as well. Things seem relatively back to normal, which for me is pretty good... Presumably not so good for all the low-income folk in this city because they seemed a little frustrated by what passes as normal here."

Pretty much all the functions of an IDE are available in both vi and emacs (compile, debug, run, tabbing, syntax highlighting, macros, project management, etc.). The only thing they really don't have are look-and-feel and variable font sizes due to the constraint of running in a terminal."
ABCDesis,349gw7,frackaracka,2,Wed Apr 29 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Look-and-feel, exactly! A decent GUI is one of those mentally reassuring things to me. I know I can do everything I want on vi or emacs but using an IDE with a good GUI makes me feel like I have less burden on my mind.   I understand where you are coming from because I often find a lot of operations in Linux more convenient on the terminal, even when there are GUIs available for the Ubuntu versions that I use. I find the GUI version more tedious, like taking a roundabout rather than a straightforward path."

ABCDesis,349gw7,wizarrd,3,Wed Apr 29 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"Emacs is a bit too heavy and clunky for my tastes, and writing lisp gives me a headache. I'm tired of emacs trying to be too smart and enforcing its own tabbing style, especially when I'm pasting something from the internet and it ends up in a weird spacing cascade. I'm tired of php-mode failing to understand html and html-mode failing to understand php and both trying to correct things for me. I also don't particularly like the keybinding scheme emacs uses; vi uses mostly letter keys, which are always under my fingers and are consistently placed in all keyboards (unlike meta and ctrl). Even if I'm not using vi, being intimately familiar with default vi keybindings is useful because so many other programs and apps use them. Finally, vi is available by default on almost all unix systems while the same cannot be said about emacs because of the sheer volume of dependencies it has.  All in all, if I can climb that learning curve, I think switching from emacs to vi will be a good switch for me."

ABCDesis,345efn,immilaw,9,Tue Apr 28 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"I am Tamil and my mother has a slight distaste for North Indians. My mother was partially raised in Calcutta, so she has more affinity for Bengali culture. She has never been to Bombay and she has never lived in Delhi, though she speaks Hindi. My father has lived in Delhi so he has a somewhat positive view of North Indians. But still, I've grown up hearing that North Indians are patriarchal/small-minded and materialistic, and a bit uncouth as well. Unfortunately some of the NI's I know confirm to the stereotype, with their disdain for dark skin and non-Indian, non-white people. Unfortunately also all the casual sexism I have heard from Indians came only from North Indians. The kind of sexist jokes I've heard the Bihari and UP and Punjabis make would never fly in our household. I have to admit I share the distaste a bit. That is because I feel that diasporic desi culture is too North Indian dominated and anybody who has not grown up in that culture is really made to feel like an outsider. I didn't even know what a qawwali was until I started watching old Indian movies. I don't understand Hindi/Urdu. Etc.   TamBrahms, in my experience, also have stereotypes of other South Indians. Mallus eat weird food. Telugus (disparagingly called 'Gultis') are also weirdly patriarchal, materialistic and LOVE to 'keep it in the family' (they are kinda known for uncle-niece marriages). I can't think of any stereotypes of Kannadigas though.  We love to poke fun at Bengalis and their pretentiousness, in good humour. Only a few days ago my father labeled Marathis as 'crazy' for all their Bajrang Dal/RSS/Shiv Sena nonsense.

The current leader of Communist party of India(M) is a Telugu guy. There are also several Telugu people in the leadership of the Naxalites. Naxalism was very active in AP until Chandrababu Naidu and YSR broke it in the 90s and early 2000s. But I think the current generation would be the last set of Communists from AP.

The reality is that most Desi unification is a very recent trend (hell ethnic unification in general like Punjabiyat only dates to the 19th century). I was reading a book talking about how one factor for Punjabi soldiers siding with the British in the mutiny was distaste for ""Poorbiyan"" sepoys who now were rebelling.  To me, Punjabi-Gujrati hate is abominable, but just as much as Punjabi-black hate. We have differences, so we shouldn't seek to cleanse those differences so much as accept them.   re: Sardar Ji jokes, most Punjabi Jatt Sikhs hate them and make their own stereotypes. In a way we're like rednecks, farmers and proud, and pretty ethnocentric despite what others think (that's not always a good thing).

I feel as if most Jatts in modern times just flaunt it on their insta and twitter profiles and aren't actually violent and such. Some of the greatest intellectuals in Punjab were Jatts as well, so one can't always generalize.  It is a much different culture than typical Desis, that I'll give. But I always believe as one of my core ideals that you treat people as individuals. Culture is generalization but each person's worldview will ultimately be unique and it's worth getting to know that individual over generalizing.

Muhammad bin Qasim notes that he faces resistance from Punjabi and Sindhi Jatts. However, the Haryanvi Jaats eventually made their own empire, and Sikh Jatts started to nationalize themselves (Jatt pride emerged) after Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa primarily. The Sikh misls is what caused Jatts to dominate the Punjab politically, although there were Jatt Kings like the Brars.  Ironically the Khalsa was created to dissolve caste like Jatt...but it ended up uplifting Jatts as a whole, pushed them into further relevance, and thus created this culture."

The whole thing about Khalsa being created to dissolve caste but in the end uplifting Jatts is so typical of the subcontinent. Caste is such an entrenched system of division in the society there that no religion, even one that explicitly abhors casteism, could trump it. The whole idea of dividing people on the basis of profession and then making profession hereditary is so powerful.

Same goes for me. We get along well, but, there is no denying that the differences are noticeable, too. Language dialect and food are visible. And my general upbringing differs from them. Like, these people didn't grow up with Limca and I didn't grow up with Pakola. But at the end of the day, we do speak Urdu, share many general Desi similarities, and tend to be Muslims which unites us quite well. It's up to the individual (both parties) how much they want those differences defining and separating them.

ABCDesis,345efn,akbar-great_chai-tea,2,Wed Apr 29 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"Here is what I've noticed about South Asia: There are quite a few cultural zones within India. Of course, each cultural zone may include 100s of millions of people, and there could be exceptions to my generalizations, so take these with a grain of mustard.    Punjabis: Punjabi Hindus are smooth-talking, charming, but will screw you over. I know. All Punjabis are spend-thrift. The Sikhs are more so, and very generous. Sikhs are bon-vivants, optimistic, and amazing hearted people. Within the Sikh community, ~55% are Jatts. They are very tall - even in white American standards, robust, and able to undergo a lot of hardships (like endure a boring time in a farming village in remote Utah, endure less sleep, and/or great uncertainties, which is why they are good at business). I believe that Jatts invented all aspects of Sikh culture, like Bhangra, and being brave. Jatts were definitely a Scythian people who came to South Asia relatively recently - about 1500 years ago, and are genetically related to some Pashtuns! Jatt Sikhs - not to be confused with Jaats of Haryana - are the most patriarchal people in India, next to the Muslims. They give too much freedom to the boys. Also, they do a lot of steroids! Same goes for non-Jatt Sikhs.  Gujaratis - can be quite clannish, pushy, and disloyal. They can be amazing back-stabbers. However, their love for Desi things inspire me. They are quite miserly, and they know all the loopholes. We all know of Gujjus who are millionaires, in terms of assets. Yet, their kids eat free lunch at school! Gujarati female outfits tend to be a little slutty. Another aspect of Gujju culture is that they have a competition with the Punjabis.  Sindhis are great dressers and are quite sophisticated. Amazing business people. Clannish. Only let daughters marry other Sindhis.  Bengali Hindus and Muslims are quite nice. Hindus are left-leaning, are artsy, proud of Hindustan, resent partition, and are quite friendly. Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh are nice also. They are shy about being Bangladeshi, since it's a poor and crowded nation. They're Sufis moderates.  The Northern cultural zone - is Maharashtra, MP, Bihar, Chat., Jharkhand, Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan. They're all simple people, and they model their culture after Punjabis and try to coat-tail onto it. Not much history or culture is known from these areas. Who is a famous Marathi-American? UP-American?  South India is another cultural zone. Their ethos is different! They're milder, patriotic, too sensitive, lose sleep if they spend money, and less fashionable. They're intellectual, work hard in academics, are not rowdy, eat less meat. The Telegus are too stingy and cheap. They, like Gujjus, are into loopholes.  Mallus are cocky. They all hang out irrespective of their religion, which is very interesting! You'll see Christians, Hindus, and Muslim Malayalees hanging out at their Yonam Festival! Kannadigas - very mild mannered and polite. Don't work as hard as the... Tamils. They're also fiercely proud of their language. They're agreeable, hard-working, humble, and decent.  Kashmiri Hindus - sneaky. Confused about their shifting opinion of Kashmir as a disputed territory.  NE Indians - marginalized. I don't know too many at all.  Pakistani Pashtuns - Not as good as they like to think of themselves. Not as honest, not as loyal, not as brave as they say they are. They're always looking for chances to be aggressive.  Pakistani Punjabis - more rowdy, more chutzpah, less shame than anyone in India. Attractive. Aggressive. Long hair parted in the middle and full of gel. Dress with a little too much flair...all the time...and taking selfies all the time.  Sri Lankans Tamils - proud, fun, rowdy."

But they are good people overall. After having been to places across India, my parents now believe that Punjabis from Punjab are amazing people but Punjabi families who immigrated from Pakistan and are settled around Delhi, Uttarakhand and Himachal are hard to deal with. Gujju women are more dominant than men. I don't know if my parents are the only Bengalis who think this way but after living in Gujarat for more than three years, this is their heartfelt belief. This is especially news to them because Gujarati society comes across as more misogynist than Bengali society and is troubled by extensive female foeticide. Telugus are very nice people even if they tend to be simpletons in general (nice but dumb essentially) but Tamils are always angry and aggressive.   My father used to be aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-Kashmiri but over the years, he has mellowed out a lot. He still talks some mildly anti-Muslim stuff but one vacation to Kashmir and he came back a reformed person on the Kashmir front (""What the Indian army has done to those people is disgusting and they have a right to be mad"").  However, my parents' real hatred comes out against not Punjabis or Muslims or whoever. It is against people from East Bengal, now known as Bangladesh. Hindu or Muslim, you'll rarely hear a nice word about ""Baangaals"" in general from my parents.

One odd thing I've noticed though is as much as my family identifies as Bangal, they still have a sort of ""cultural cringe"" about their traditional dialects. Like my mom speaks in the Kolkata dialect, quite close to the standard written choltibhasha, but if I speak like a Bangal for effect, I'm met with ""DON'T TALK LIKE A BANGLADESHI!"". I honestly don't see what the big deal is; there isn't any inherently better dialect, and there is such a wide body of songs in the Bangal dialects.  But it is true that Bangladesh has wonderful textiles and traditional handloom work like jamdani. I'd like to visit there, but it seems no one else in my family has any interest to go there."
ABCDesis,345efn,Shinobhi,2,Tue Apr 28 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course it's ridiculous.  Regarding accents, the funny thing is that there is no distinct east-west divide in accents. My father comes from Malda in northern Bengal and their accents sound hilarious to me. My mother's family is from Katwa in south-western Bengal and their accent is also distinct from Kolkata posh. Bangladesh also has many different accents like Jessore, Chittagong, Barishal, Sylhet etc. But there's definitely a feeling that not talking in 'Kolkata neutral' makes you look illiterate. Even excessive poshness like light 't's and 'r's as used by some young people is frowned upon. Very British-style accent discrimination!"

ABCDesis,3466mb,Anandya,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:22:06 2015 UTC,It's more acceptable to ask in the UK. Channel 4 also famously don't do soft interviews for anything. They also tan the questions by his people.
ABCDesis,3466mb,_superliminal,2,Wed Apr 29 05:40:48 2015 UTC,Yeah and he talks posts a link to a very good article he wrote about the incident on the Guardian. I've been watching Channel 4 news every day for about 15 years and he's been on there the entire time. He is a good interviewer and definitely it better interviewing politicians.   Channel 4 doesn't do movie promo interviews which explains why RDJ was confused but he was warned in advance about the content of the interview so I don't understand where the confusion came from.

Muslims not down for pork because they think it's gross? All Jihadis would need is a good dosage of bacon. Indians are vegetarian? No wonder they look like the twigs they eat. But for all god's sake, think about the poor dogs! /s  I know I went a bit extreme, but this link really pisses me off. I personally, as a Sikh grown up in America, eat beef/pork/whatever but don't consume dog, cat, horse, etc, meat because of my culture. So this doesn't personally affect me. But it frustrates me to see this hypocrisy and double standard in American society. I am absolutely no supporter of Hindutva, and I think the beef bans are a bit ridiculous in some areas (such as where you get a higher sentence than for a rape), but honestly for all people talk about how this is solely a problem with ethnocentric Hindu nationalists, it's not; they sound awfully like the [American] people in this petition attacking the ""uncivilized"" Chinese for their taste for dog."
ABCDesis,344be0,brandysnifter,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"Another thing to keep in mind is that lots of Chinese people in China were upset about the festival. More and more Chinese people are keeping pets nowadays and there is a cultural shift from seeing dogs as a food source, to dogs as companion animals. Chinese social media sites were abuzz with disturbing pictures from previous festivals.  So opposition to the festival is not completely coming from a Western-centric view of ""uncivilized Chinese"" people."

ABCDesis,344be0,Hot4_TeaCha,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:43:05 2015 UTC,The issue I have with dog meat is the poor treatment of animals. Standards need to be put in place.
ABCDesis,344be0,Anandya,9,Tue Apr 28 05:48:20 2015 UTC,You think factory farmed beef and chicken are treated much better?
ABCDesis,344be0,Hot4_TeaCha,0,Tue Apr 28 14:27:01 2015 UTC,Depends. There are standards. And there are regulations for factory farming too. We aren't discussing veal crates or foie grad but simple ordinary pasture cattle and pork.
ABCDesis,344be0,Anandya,8,Tue Apr 28 14:34:44 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of meat eaten in the U.S. is not ""simple, ordinary pasture"" anything. You don't need to get into veal and foie gras before you encounter agricultural practices that will make your skin crawl.   But that's besides the point. To say the issue with dog meat is lack of standards in their care, then we would be talking about improving the standards. Not about banning the thing. Since you're evidently comfortable with eating cow and pig if there is a decent enough regulatory system in place to make sure they're not treated cruelly, the same should be true of dog shouldn't it?"

ABCDesis,342s1b,mangolicious989,18,Mon Apr 27 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"When I went to India to visit relatives about 6 years ago, they looked at me and said ""you've put on some weight recently, I thought you do dance?"" And when I went about three years ago they said ""you lost so much weight, what happened? Are you not eating?""   I think there's a lot of shame and policing surrounding women's bodies in desi communities, from what I've seen. My mom routinely made comments towards my body when I was growing up, but when I told her that it really affects my perception of body image, she brushed it off and got mad because I couldn't take a joke. She said that it's not a big deal because she and her family and friends tease each other about it all the time.  From my experiences, I feel like eating disorders aren't taken seriously. They're not seen as disorders that require treatment, and those with EDs are just told to grow up and stop taking everyone's comments so seriously.  My family and network of aunties are really really conservative though. What about y'all, how would your community/family respond to EDs?"
ABCDesis,342s1b,HUG_MACHINE,3,Mon Apr 27 23:21:28 2015 UTC,I agree. I feel like eating disorders is something that desi uncles and aunties wouldn't qualify as a real disease because it is something they can't see physically.

ABCDesis,342s1b,x6tance,9,Tue Apr 28 02:52:46 2015 UTC,"I had a rare type of an eating disorder called ""diabulimia"" for 3 years. I ate pretty much everything I wanted to eat and purged my calories by under-dosing my insulin (I'm Type 1 diabetic). This was extremely dangerous and I essentially manipulated my disease/medication to lose weight. I was basically in a constant state of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and weighed in around 92 lbs. I eventually pulled myself out of this vicious cycle and slowly got back on track to taking better care of myself, but developed a complication (gastroparesis) shortly thereafter which continued on for a few months before I got better. I didn't return to my normal weight until about a year later. I didn't tell my mother simply because I didn't want to burden her with worry. She is already there for me so much that I couldn't bear the idea of her knowing what I was doing to myself--it would have hurt her tremendously. I don't know if my father would have understood. He likens himself to be a man of science but psychological disorders are something he just doesn't understand and I often wonder if he would have placed the blame on me in some way. Either way, I didn't want them to worry so I just stayed quiet about it (although I let my brother and boyfriend know into the 3rd year, only because I was afraid I might put myself in a hospital).  I went on to study health science and interned at an eating disorders clinic with a nutritionist where I developed educational material for diabetic eating disordered patients as well as anorexics and bulimics. My experience all in all was nothing short of hell."

ABCDesis,3418a6,Bustcratch,2,Tue Apr 28 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"GRRM told them the ending just in case he died or couldn't finish the book. Apparently they will deviate from the book, but it will converge again at the end and have almost the exact same ending."

Plenty of Bong women get their masters, PhDs and more and marry well into their early 30s (really late for most Indians).   As long as they are seen as following some traditional tropes like wearing traditional or Western-fusion clothing (very popular among Bengali intellectuals) and have a steady boyfriend, they are only implied to be ""aantels"". However, if they are seen as wearing completely Western wear and/or have short relationships, they have the ""looseness"" tagged in, which male ""aantels"" who are into short relationships don't have to deal with."

ABCDesis,33u9av,TeslaModelE,12,Sat Apr 25 18:06:48 2015 UTC,NYT's hostility towards anything-India ever since right wing Modi became PM is no coincidence. There have been way too many exaggerated articles in the last two years.
ABCDesis,33u9av,oneearth,19,Sat Apr 25 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"The hostility began way before Modi. At one point, they had a section on India specifically meant to focus on India's negatives, which would have been great had it been promoted that way. It's important to focus on problems. Instead, NYT made it look like everyone in India is miserable except for the mythical upper-class Indians (anybody who has been to college and has a job) who ruthlessly oppress the poor.   Heck, in one instance, when discussing grocery stores in India, they concluded that Indians could only afford eating fresh vegetables because they have poor servants to buy and cook at home. Because you know, American vegetables are all grown and harvested by well-fed White farmers and definitely not seasonal, underpaid Mexican labour!"
ABCDesis,33u9av,akbar-great_chai-tea,7,Sat Apr 25 20:30:12 2015 UTC,Why do they have this attitude towards India?
ABCDesis,33u9av,LotusEyes92,13,Sat Apr 25 20:41:24 2015 UTC,I think NYT belongs to a particular 60s' brand of liberalism. They support oppressed groups as long as they don't act too uppity. The idea that countries like India and China can improve their standards of living and even threaten America's economy makes them defensive enough to lash out.
ABCDesis,33u9av,akbar-great_chai-tea,9,Sat Apr 25 21:24:45 2015 UTC,Well that's just plain racism. Do they do this to China as well?

ABCDesis,33u9av,in_the_airoplane,9,Sat Apr 25 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I tried to ask /r/India why the US hated Modi so much, but unsurprisingly I didn't get good answers (just abstract generalities like, ""US hates any threat to it being a superpower"").  My guess is that the US is wary of Modi's economic policies. The States has wanted India to open its borders to FDI and American companies for some time, but India doesn't want to play ball as much as they'd like. Even Starbucks had to joint venture with Tata because (my understanding) is that there's a certain percent required of Indian ownership.   The US has been much friendlier to India since Modi has shown more interest in globalism, though. But the PM still gives a middle finger on issues like climate change. I think ""frenemies"" is probably the best word to describe US-India relations."
ABCDesis,33u9av,KaliYugaz,5,Sat Apr 25 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"Modi is a pro business guy more than anything else. If at all, US' interest in INDIA has improved. NYT though has other ideas. A conservative party, BJP, backed by wing nuts from the RSS is all they see."
ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,2,Sat Apr 25 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, and this is why I think one notices rhetoric softening since Modi's campaign, which basically smeared him as a Hindu fundamentalist hellbent on killing all Muslims. Coverage is still rough, but I think it's better than it was."
ABCDesis,33u9av,oneearth,5,Sat Apr 25 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"At the same time we shouldn't pretend that there is no reason at all to be apprehensive about the rise of right-wing figures in politics. It's a global phenomenon at this point, from growing xenophobic parties in Europe to Shinzo Abe's ultranationalist faction dominating Japan to Xi Jinping's more aggressive pro-military stance in China to Putin's complete rejection of the global order. Middling economic cooperation is the only thing keeping a lid on an increasingly volatile cauldron of competitive rivalry and tribalism. We don't know how long that will last."
ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,2,Sat Apr 25 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"growing xenophobic parties in Europe   this is what scares me...so many people assume that we are on a timescale of constantly going progressively more and more liberal, and while that may be true in the long run there are always right wing flips that hurt minorities."
ABCDesis,33u9av,oneearth,2,Sun Apr 26 00:31:04 2015 UTC,I think NYT is a little jelly that Modi is popular despite their constant bashing.
ABCDesis,33u9av,Jantajanardan,2,Sun Apr 26 04:50:18 2015 UTC,"I used to think this and thus supported Modi at election time, but if you look at what BJP and Hindu nationalists have done since they've gotten into power, they've pushed an awful lot of stuff related to their Hindutva narrative and not many substantial improvements in the areas they promised. Although farmer suicides are up so I suppose that's always good.   A conservative party, BJP, backed by wing nuts from the RSS is all they see.   Yeah, welcome to politics. One could argue that despite its economic policies divorced from the social ones, a Conservative party, the Republicans, backed by Tea Partiers is all they (American liberals) see."
ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,2,Sat Apr 25 23:49:18 2015 UTC,My 2 cents.  Bjp is India's progressive party. They are conservative. Republicans are outright conservative.

But what rises to gain attention is things like the church attacks....which weren't attacks at all. Modi has also put many US NGOs on the watch list. AFAIK this could also affect NYTs love for India.
ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,-1,Sun Apr 26 04:01:25 2015 UTC,"You think Indian newspapers are truthful?    I think when an entire section of media that has function outside of serving as official BJP political mouthpiece, including newspapers and journalists, say something, yes I do think that there is more truth in that than someone who has a love affair with BJP and no real arguments other than ""zOmG sickular media is so corrupted!1!1!""  I actually read a piece by an American investor the other day who essentially said he was not investing in India because Modi ""was all talk.""

ABCDesis,33u9av,Jantajanardan,12,Sun Apr 26 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"We're not speaking of how individuals perceive Modi, but the media. These are often two separate things. And sadly, the human rights track record of a leader is not always consistent with the type of coverage he or she receives.   Case in point: Iran and Saudi Arabia. Uganda. Venezuela. North Korea. The US hates/loves countries for reasons that have nothing to do with how a nation treats its people. Hell, we instigated torture in Chile and taught the Pinochet regime how to do it. So, it's facile to say that the US media dislikes Modi because of the Gujarat riots. If US precedent of ignoring far more severe genocide is any indicator, the US couldn't really care about the Gujarat riots, to be honest... it's simply a convenient reason to demonize him. So the larger question is, why does the media want the public to be unsympathetic to India? I believe the reason is as old as history: economics.  It's advantageous for the public to think of India as a primitive, backwards society... because who better to save the country from itself than the more civilized, technologically-advanced and egalitarian Americans? Obviously this isn't how it actually plays out... but it's an easy pitch to the people when companies like Halliburton and Goldman Sachs want a greater presence in one of the biggest emerging global economies."
ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,2,Sat Apr 25 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that US media oftentimes compromises with HR when it clashes with corporate/govt interests, but criticism of Modi has stretched back all the way to 2002 when he was CM of Gujarat. Long before he was on anyone's radar to become PM. I think that is something that will stick with him throughout his tenure as PM.   I agree with your point on economics. I think it goes hand in hand with the orientalist attitudes I see in the media about the subcontinent."
ABCDesis,33u9av,alwaysLearning1984,-3,Sat Apr 25 23:52:04 2015 UTC,Heard of the massacres carried out by Obama in the name of war in Afghanistan and Iraq?   Oh....I forgot... He won the Nobel peace prize. By Obama's standards Modi might just miss out on the peace prize though. Three digit kills aren't enough for the Nobel prize committee.

ABCDesis,33u9av,asdfioho,9,Sun Apr 26 02:47:07 2015 UTC,NYT isn't hostile to India because of Modi. They're just stupid. Everything they write about India is always tinged with a heavy dose of Orientalism (as defined by Edward Said). A couple months ago I read an article where the author reported on the Ganpati celebrations in Jackson Heights.

When you go to the doctor, make sure they test you for various deficiencies, and if any come up, make sure they are addressed.  Because stress is kind of a given in my lifestyle, and I also tend to not have time for proper hair care, I've been keeping my hair short-ish since my early 20s. I think that's helped a lot with having the hair re-grow from bad periods. At least I seem to have a lot more hair on my head left, and healthier hair, than my sister or cousins, who left their hair long. But that's anecdata.

I noticed when I stopped eating meat and didn't replace it with other proteins for a little while, my hair would fall out more. Another reason to up the protein in your diet!

I think one thing to note is that contra to modern Islamist and Hindutva narratives of there being some constant Hindu-Muslim clash in the subcontinent, the truth was far from it. It's definitely true that certain groups of Muslims saw themselves as bringing civilization to the Hindu, and certain Hindu groups saw Muslims as foreign ""phirangis,"" but in reality there was a synthesis of culture. The Islamic emperors adopted symbols used by previous Hindu kings, and they actually extended people of the book status to Hindus. The Mughal hierarchy was filled with high-caste Hindus at the higher levels, and many Hindu kings maintained autonomy other than paying taxes to the Mughal emperor.   In a way, the invasion of Iran was similar, with Abbas adopting symbols of ancient Zoroastrian kings, such as the title ""Shah."""
ABCDesis,33pvyz,asdfioho,10,Fri Apr 24 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"Contrary to common beliefs, most other faiths were actually not 'crushed' or 'eradicated'. The crushing part did happen in parts of Western and Northern Europe in case of Christianity and Persia and Arabia in case of Islam but for the most part, Islam and Christianity didn't actually eradicate the dominant pagan religions.   When Islam arrived in India (outside parts of Sindh) in the late 12th century, Hinduism was already an organized (edit: semi-organized) pagan religion although with distinct regional flavors. This was largely due to the influence of Buddhism and Jainism as counter movements to orthodox Vedic and neo-Vedic religions that dotted the subcontinent for millennia.  In Europe, Northern and Western European religions were not widespread and semi-organized like Hinduism. Only the Romans had an organized pagan religion with local flavors just like Hinduism. Roman paganism then absorbed parts of Christianity and morphed into Catholicism. At the time when Italy was turning Christian rapidly, many other forms of Christianity existed and had major disputes among themselves. Roman Catholicism survived due to the support of Carolingians and went on to become the major faith in Western and Northern Europe. Eastern Orthodox Chuch lost state support when Asia Minor and Middle East started being ruled by Muslims rulers and their populations declined probably because of conversion and some degree of state coercion and rarely due to massacres. Islam in Arabia also faced a multitude of small pagan religions and did absorb some elements although far less than Catholicism absorbed from Roman paganism. Islam was spread truly by sword only in Persia where Zoroastrianism held sway. This is literally the only instance of Islam or Christianity wiping out a powerful, semi-organized religion through war and massacre. In South-East Asia, Eastern Africa and Kerala, Islam spread primarily through trade connections. All trading communities converting to the same faith made it easier to establish business and family connections and played a major role in the increase in the Indian Ocean trade.   TL;DR - Islam and Christianity only crushed or eradicated smaller, localized pagan religions and this is not even how most regions became majority Christian and Muslim. European states played the major role in establishing a single form of Christianity as the major religion in Europe, trade played the major role in spreading Islam in Eastern Africa, South-East Asia and southern India and Sufi missionaries played the major role in spreading Islam in India. The Islamic invasion of Persia was literally the only exception in that Islam crushed a major, semi-organized religion."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,0,Fri Apr 24 17:28:09 2015 UTC,Dude Hinduism is not an organised pagan religion. Two separate and distinct things.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,ShereOnFire,5,Fri Apr 24 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"Umm, Hinduism is a pagan religion by most definitions. And I used the word semi-organized because while there are no authorities or organizations controlling the religion (which incidentally neither Islam nor Christianity has any more), there is a common pantheon, mythology, rituals and beliefs that are shared across the board. Hence, it's different from say traditional Chinese religions where gods, beliefs and rituals differ from region to region."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,3,Fri Apr 24 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Those definitions were defined under an Abrahamic context rather than a neutral perspective. Plus many Hindus are monotheistic, so it's harder under to pin down under that definition which is rather broad and you can put any religion under that if you really wanted to.  Also when I read your comment it was organised and not semi organised?"
ABCDesis,33pvyz,ShereOnFire,6,Fri Apr 24 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"'Pagan religion' denotes a lot of different meanings and there's no universal meaning that can encompass all or most world religions. In the context of Abrahamic monotheism, Hinduism can be fairly easily categorized as pagan (like you mention).  As far as Hinduism being monotheistic, that's more of an old Hindu reformist viewpoint from 19th century in order to prove to British colonial masters that Hinduism is not some degenerate weirdo religion. There was also considerable opposition to idol worship among Hindu reformers from the 19th century for the same reason. Some parts of Hinduism might believe in monotheism (one true God) while many other parts don't, much like acceptance of atheism. But acceptance of atheism does not make Hinduism similar to Buddhism where the unimportance of the question of the existence of God is a central tenet.   Obviously, as is clear, the definition of what constitutes religion or god is not universal.  Fair point. I should change it to semi-organized because that's what I meant."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,4,Fri Apr 24 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"Panentheism or monism would probably be more accurate terms to describe God in Hinduism than monotheism, with panentheism being the divine is not only a part of the universe, but also beyond it, and monism meaning there's one unifying substance among everything in existence. Inclusive monotheism would also be a good description for Hinduism since it still recognizes other deities as opposed to exclusive monotheism."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,Vishuddha_94,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:35:46 2015 UTC,"Monism is only an aspect of Hindu philosophical canon, encapsuled by the Advaita philosophy. I don't think the entirety of Hindu religious beliefs can be captured by monism. There are definitely other competing beliefs to monism in Hinduism.  Inclusive monotheism seems to be closer to what Hinduism is. However, there are multiple (three to be precise) supreme gods in modern Hinduism as opposed to the one higher god as subscribed by inclusive monotheism.   Like I said, the definition of religion is not rigid and cannot always be defined by an Abrahamic interpretation. There are multiple ways to express what Hinduism is."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Hinduism as defined in its core framework in the Vedas is not a ""pagan religion"" so much as what VSindhicate said. India does have pre-Hindu faiths: look at the ""tribal"" people's who are pagan, or the religious rituals of Jathera and such that predate Hinduism. Hinduism does have its own mythology, but so do Abrahamic religions for that matter.  That said the history of Hindu philosophy is complex as it has changed and absorbed other beliefs over time and I do admit a good amount of what you hear nowadays is reformist"
ABCDesis,33pvyz,asdfioho,3,Sat Apr 25 11:47:17 2015 UTC,"Pagan is not animist. I mention this because you mention tribal religions as pagan, they were more likely animist as in worshiping natural elements directly. Native American religions or the Mongol religion were Shamanist i.e. there were symbols or totems to stand for natural elements. Hinduism was more abstract than that but again, 'pagan' is a term that is defined with respect to Abrahamic religions so it's not a very comfortable term to use for Hinduism either.  This has turned out to be a such an interesting discussion, completely separate from the controversial historical point that started it. Thanks to everyone!"

Catholics literally burned at the cross the Sephardic Jews of India and Hindus. MAny Catholics of south India have Sephardic roots!

ABCDesis,33pvyz,book-of-kells,2,Sat Apr 25 09:32:19 2015 UTC,"Do you have any source for any of these claims? I am not interested in talking conspiracy theories here.   Native Americans became Christians on their own accord, for the most part. The US government often made it difficult or outright illegal to practive Native religions but Christianity wasn't imposed on them by force. Yes, Nuristanis were converted forcibly but again, they followed their smallish folk religion much like small pre-Islamic religions in Arabia that I mentioned. The Africans who were brought to the US as slaves were primarily from Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Cameroon. None of these countries were majorly Christian or Muslim before slavery. Some of the Africans might have been nominally Muslim due to living close to North African trade routes but again, their adoption of Christianity was on their own. If anything, the US government didn't like African slaves having pastors and their own churches because that could have, and indeed had, made them revolt against slavery. India has historically had small Jewish communities, usually along the western coast. They are not Sephardic Jews. Most of them arrived during the pre-Islamic era and some arrived with Muslim Arab traders as merchants. How did Guru Tegh Bahadur force Kashmiri Hindus to become Muslims? That seems like against what he was known for. Yes, Aurangzeb had some policies of forcible conversion but a lot of that is also political propaganda by his opponents. Aurangzeb had the entirety of northern India under his rule and there were rarely any major instances of state-sanctioned conversion.

I'm pretty well aware that other ""Muslim oppressors"" are mischaracterized in order to give modern Hindutva members ""payback"" fuel, but Aurangzeb genuinely perplexes me. He killed Guru Tegh Bahadur in lieu of Kashmiri Pandits who refused to convert...but he also was allied with a lot of Rajput princes. He demolished some temples and created mosques in their stead (the one in Mathura for example), but permitted the majority to go on unhampered. Why this contradiction?"

Heck, the US bombed an entire country and killed hundreds of thousands for no justifiable reason. Yet, it's not like the US is inflicting a genocide on Muslims and there are many Muslim countries that are US allies. American Muslims lead safe and fairly prosperous lives for the most part. Some of those countries which are allies are polar opposites despite being Muslim-majority, like Saudi and Turkey.   Taking the above into consideration, Aurangzeb makes a lot more sense. He was running the world's largest empire after all."

But crushing cultural identity is a little harder. Especially the people trying to suppress you are from an out-group. (Islamic invaders and European Christianity). Call it tribalism.  Lot of Hindus I know aren't particularly religious and some are downright atheist. But they still consider themselves Hindus.  It's similar to Jews. You can find many non-practicing Jews. But they will identify themselves as Jews if asked. That's probably why Judaism survived in Europe despite hundreds of years of antisemitism.   Also, it helped that Hindus never had a central controlling leadership or controlling body. So it's been a very decentralized religion for 1000s of years and it's form varied across regions in South Asia. Hindus in South India aren't like Hindus in North-East India."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,zingbat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"Hinduism survived because it's really a cultural identity first and then a religion.    This is assuming that European paganism isn't a cultural identity, which isn't correct. Even with the advent of Christianity in Europe, we did not see Christianity replace the previous culture or religion in its entirety, if anything, Christianity adopted many pagan cultural and religious practices and added a Christian context to it (See Christmas). Even in Iran, many ancient Zoroastrian practices continue to play a major role in their current identity as Iranian Shi'a Muslims, despite the fact that they live in an ""Islamic Republic"". Animist traditions and cultural practices continue to play a central role in daily life of Muslims and Christians in Western Africa.   Another glaring example is the practice of Catholocism throughout the world. Latin American Christianity is not the same, and no where close to what we see in Europe. While core values and traditions are shared, there are a lot of other factors such as local history, culture, and language that have shaped various religious traditions throughout the world.  Pagan traditions and cultures continue to be a huge part of Muslim culture in South Asia and Central Asia from various traditional practices from marriage, birth, and death. So this idea that Hinduism ""survived"" while others didn't due to its cultural identity is just flat out not true. Sure, pagan religious beliefs may be gone, but pagan practices have not, if anything they've been adopted and molded to meet the standard of whatever host culture that they are a part of."

ABCDesis,33pvyz,desi_ninja,6,Fri Apr 24 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Mostly because the presumption that other faiths were crushed is wrong. A part of conversions were definitely by sword, but majority converted because of just will (notice, I am not saying faith here, but will).  Like in case of Islam, pre-islam religions were even more orthodox and had social classes whereas Islam offered a simpler, easier way where everyone is same in eyes of Allah. In India also, time and again , people oppressed by caste system have converted to religions like Buddhism and Islam over the years.  The reason Hinduism survived this all is in inherent nature of Hinduism. It is so flexible in nature that it incorporates the good parts of other religions. Now if you start getting the same reforms in your religion, why would you leave.  Around 150 BC, large conversions to Buddhism was happening. What it did ? It brought Buddhist values to Hinduism.  Hence, Hinduism became appealing again. The effect of hinduism's flexibility is so strong that during Islamic conquests of parts of India, the people who used to be forced to convert to Islam would convert back again to Hinduism once tghr situation normalized or a Hindu rules came.

ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"My, surface knowledge of Hinduism, involves the existence of various deities--so it would seem to odd to maintain that with the lack of belief in deities.  I merely meant it seemed counter-intuitive based on my limited knowledge."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,shallowpuddles2,3,Tue Apr 28 15:25:40 2015 UTC,"I'm glad this is not turning into some ""Hinduism is soooo peaceful"" circlejerk like in some other subreddits.   Also, even most educated Hindus don't know a thing about Christianity. They constantly conflate all the churches and the different doctrines from the churches. I'm definitely not all-knowing, but I know a bit more from being a Classicist. I am still learning a lot though. (If anyone can recommend some good, serious texts on the history of Christianity, that would be awesome.)  I would like to note that though Roman emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity, it was a personal conversion. It was Theodosius I that made Christianity the state religion of the Roman empire. This was a major turning point in world history. I was told during my courses that only if Julian the Apostate had lived a little longer, this trend could have turned around. Ha."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:37:24 2015 UTC,"Well Hinduism wasn't crushed but a large part of the subcontinent that used to be Hindu/Buddhist became Muslim (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and the 300 million Muslims in India).  So you can't say Islam didn't have a huge impact."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,2,Sat Apr 25 02:54:19 2015 UTC,Not exactly though. I think that's a simplification that the Muslims came from Buddhist roots. I remember reading a very detailed explanation somewhere.. The gist of it was the vast majority were converted in areas with heavy Sufi missionary activity.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,mcat36,2,Sat Apr 25 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Muslims didn't just convert from Buddhism. Yes a lot did. For example, Afghanistan was a majority Buddhist region before the arrival of Islam (example: Buddhas of Bamiyan statues that were destroyed by Taliban for being un-Islamic).  However, most of present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh were Hindu areas before the arrival of Islam.  I'm not sure what you're trying to say though."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,mcat36,3,Sat Apr 25 05:27:37 2015 UTC,Ah then I agree. Online I see a lot of people saying stuff like Buddhists all converted to Islam and the Muslims in the subcontinent are from Buddhist roots. I guess it's done to distance themselves from Hinduism but whatever. I thought that's what you wanted to say.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,tinkthank,2,Sat Apr 25 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"The ""Muslims converted from Buddhism"" might be true to a large extent. Buddhism in India was adopted by plenty of Dalit Hindus who wanted to get out the caste hierarchy. When Islam became the religion of the ruling class minority, it became easier to be lower-caste Muslim than a lower-caste Buddhist (Islam and Buddhism don't support the caste system officially, but it always remained a social practice in the subcontinent even with those two religions and later Christianity). Of course, I have no idea what proportion of Muslim converts in he subcontinent were originally Buddhist."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,mcat36,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:58:00 2015 UTC,Actually there's were Hindu kingdoms in Afghanistan during the Islamic migrations around 750 AD. Google up Shahi Hindu Afghanistan.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,-1,Sat Apr 25 12:50:45 2015 UTC,There are only 177M Muslims in India. Your assertion of 300M is a fallacy.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,mcat36,2,Sat Apr 25 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"I think he meant 'historical' India, which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh. If that's the case, then it is 300 million Muslims, unless he's speaking strictly of India, which would make you correct."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,-1,Sat Apr 25 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"Also there are NO COMMONALITIES between ancient  Hindus of NI and ancient Hindus of SI. People in SI were worshiping a pantheon of Non Vedic Gods and when Brahmins migrated there during the Middle Ages, they created a syncretic religion and absorbed the Dravidian gods. At the same time they accepted the Dravidian gods like Murugan, they passively imposed their own Gods like Vishnu and a new narrative of MurugAn in that now he's a incarnation of their Vishnu.  The word ""Hindu"" only appears in the 19th century. Prior to that the south Asians Hindus were not a cohesive bunch with new vagaries identities."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,book-of-kells,6,Sat Apr 25 03:56:01 2015 UTC,I think your era is off by many centuries because when it comes to imperial artifacts from south and north the deities are not too different even in around 500 AD.
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,-1,Sat Apr 25 05:03:36 2015 UTC,"Very good and valid point! Have an invite on me!  However, maybe I'm ignorant, but if you could illuminate the big mystery of when, how, and why South Indian, Northeastern Indian, and other Hindu places worship gods not found in the Vedas?   I personally think that during the Brahmin migrations, which were probably very UNMILITARY AND PEACEFUL migrations of people , that in order to subjugate extend an olive branch to the locals, the Brahmins co-opted the local's own Gods with theirs. The syncretic religion which formed was called ""Hinduism"" by the Britishers. So at one level, the Brahmins basically tricked the locals whom they were culturally dominating.   Case in point, many names that we think are South Indian are actually of North Indian (i.e. sanskritic) etymology. Names like Muralidharan, Raghavan, Subramoniam, are pretty much owned by southerners but these names came from the north."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,book-of-kells,3,Sat Apr 25 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"<South Indian, non Brahmin, and of a non Dravidian ethnicity here>  Well, I think India had some undefined local deities and stuff, and as the Brahmin based faith spread the upper classes picked up those Brahman deities and beliefs. However the lower classes still followed their deities, though they picked up aspects of the 'higher' beliefs and the village beliefs started being viewed through the prism of Brahmanic Hinduism.  I don't think the Brahmins went out of their way to migrate or really spread faith or subjugate people. I mean I don't think we can ascribe such intentions to them without any proof of that. Anyway, I think they just influenced the ruling classes, and society evolved in such a way there formed a space for them. Calling it 'tricking' or 'culturally dominating' doesn't seem right to me, really, for the reasons I've stated above. Also I don't think that past maybe a few generations you could see them as non locals.  Also I strongly disagree that South Indian names that are Sanskritic are North Indian. It's hilarious to me in a way really, that you can call Rajan or Raghavan a North Indian name when it's so stereotypical of the south and you won't find it elsewhere. In fact I remember that these -an forms come from Dravidian grammatical rules. Sanskrit is a pan Indian classical language and not the sole heritage of the north."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,5,Sat Apr 25 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of how Hinduism absorbed Buddha as part of the pantheon. It was also a way for the Brahmins to have one over on the Buddhists. It's the strength of polytheistic religions that they are so adaptable.   And I'm fairly sure 'Dravidian' pertains only to linguistic groups, not ethnic.  It's also so ridiculous to say that Sanskrit only 'belongs' to the North,  I can't even. Just like with that nonsense that nothing ever happened historically in the South or whatever."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,book-of-kells,2,Sat Apr 25 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly. And the strong vegetarian tendencies and Brahmins not eating meat were adapted from Buddhism/Jainism too. People think of them as indispensable parts of Hindu culture but it's not always been that way. Also, in many regions Buddha isn't seen as an Avatar. In TN it's Balaji instead, IIRC. And in Orissa, Jagannath.  Well, I guess in some cases it's a bit of both right? I mean, Tamil is a Dravidian language but many people here also identify as being part of the Dravidian culture, race, etc. What I meant though, was that I'm not Tuluva, Tamil, Kannadiga, Telugu, Malayali etc - My mother tongue is a (south) Indo Aryan language.  As a south Indian through and through, I strongly feel Sanskrit is as part of my heritage as it is for a Bihari, Marathi or a Nepali. So many scholars of Sanskrit were from here and so many centers of learning too. Now and then you get some idiot online claiming that Sanskrit names are a 'foreign influence' in TN and whatnot and that's it's a 'cowbelt language', ugh."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,akbar-great_chai-tea,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"Actually Christianity/Catholicism at least is similarly adaptable in the sense that many local heroes or missionaries, etc. were absorbed as saints. Hence you have thousands of saints.  Hm, OK - I am Tamil and I was taught as a kid that Buddha was another Avatar. Are you Konkan? Yeah the Dravidian nationalists are pretty embarrassing. I'm pretty sure that movement is (at least partially) rooted in anti-Brahminism though."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,TaazaPlaza,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. Maybe there's some explanation, 'mainstream Hinduism' becoming the more accepted version and stuff. I've heard both, from different sources. I'm not Konkani, I'm Saurashtra (from Madurai), but the languages are pretty related and I can understand quite a bit of Konkani.   And yes. The movement is and was strongly rooted in anti-Brahmanism. At least back then it was going somewhere and was responsible for many changes but not anymore. The real tragedy these days is that Dravidian nationalism has legitimized historical revisionism and anti intellectualism to a large extent."
ABCDesis,33pvyz,mcat36,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:32:58 2015 UTC,Ah I have heard that there are a fair few Saurashtrians in TN! So stupid I didn't think of that.
ABCDesis,33r9wp,Bustcratch,11,Fri Apr 24 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"""I hold the view that has been the consensus in our country for over two centuries: that marriage is between one man and one woman.""  You know another view that had been the concensus in our country for over two centuries? That people of color (including brown people) shouldn't be allowed to vote, let alone hold public office. Might not be the morality litmus test."
ABCDesis,33r9wp,mrggy,7,Fri Apr 24 22:17:17 2015 UTC,Somebody like Jindal would probably uphold the idea that people of color shouldn't be able to vote or be full citizens if he thought that would win him some sort of relative power.

ABCDesis,33r9wp,DubZer0,0,Sat Apr 25 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"That picture is from the following oped by Louisiana Governor Bobby ""Piyush"" Jindal:  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/opinion/bobby-jindal-im-holding-firm-against-gay-marriage.html?_r=0  As you can see from the oped, Mr. Jindal is a severely right leaning conservative, while a good section of Indian Americans (especially the second and later gen ones) are rather left leaning. Also, many 2nd genners in the Indian American community are more liberal/left leaning than their parents and often view their parents' political/social views with a certain sense of embarrassment. Therefore, I was wondering what Mr. Jindal's kids will think of him and his severe conservative stance when they grow up.   Hope that helps!"

ABCDesis,33qinv,frackaracka,6,Fri Apr 24 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"This isn't directly ABCD-related but I thought that there were a few points that were relevant, particularly with Desi-American familial expectations and priorities.  This paragraph especially jumped out at me:   These children tell their parents those things that will elicit praise and hide the parts of their lives that won’t. Studies by Avi Assor, Guy Roth and Edward L. Deci suggest that children who receive conditional love often do better in the short run. They can be model students. But they suffer in the long run. They come to resent their parents. They are so influenced by fear that they become risk averse. They lose a sense of agency. They feel driven by internalized pressures more than by real freedom of choice. They feel less worthy as adults."

ABCDesis,33qinv,jot_,3,Fri Apr 24 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"I think that there is a difference between ""internalized pressure"" and ""intrinsic motivation"".

ABCDesis,33myqe,Poopyfist,3,Sat Apr 25 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit exaggerated, and forced but nonetheless a good concept."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,redditgampa,21,Thu Apr 23 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they stuck with a language that allows the both of us to communicate most effectively. Usually that's English, because there's a good chance they have a better command of English than I do of Bengali."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,GWmyc2,8,Thu Apr 23 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"I'll respond in Telugu. My Telugu is bad enough that an opportunity to practice it is welcome, haha."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,Shinobhi,7,Fri Apr 24 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I also prefer the language that is best for both, usually English.  Usually when someone (aunties) start talking to me in Urdu, I get a really panicked look on my face. I can speak Urdu just fine usually but I get really anxious of messing up and then - oh god- the teasing I cannot handle.   So, I really only speak Urdu with family/friends who know my limits. Or if I am forced to (as in they know no English)."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,bug-bear,3,Thu Apr 23 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the teasing. Makes no sense. They want you to speak the language, but mercilessly make fun of you even for a slight slip up and you are like fuck this, never again!   My dad on the other hand just beams when my kids try and that has proven to be the best enticement for my kids to learn Telugu - they soo want to please their thatha-garu, it's super cute!"
ABCDesis,33mx8i,Bustcratch,2,Fri Apr 24 12:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah this. I'll speak in Kannada if the other person would really rather not communicate in English, but I prefer English because although I'm fluent in Kannada and speak it pretty well, I'm sure there's a word or two here or there that I say a liiiiiiiiiiiiittle bit wrong that always opens me up to teasing. That, and it takes me a bit longer to formulate my thoughts in Kannada so sometimes I trip up a bit."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,oinkyy,7,Fri Apr 24 14:40:02 2015 UTC,some aunties get super disappointed when I can't respond to them in Punjabi - it makes me feel like I'm missing out. I'm trying to learn the language now though and I'm pretty excited about that
ABCDesis,33mx8i,cowabuNGa_GNarly,5,Thu Apr 23 21:31:56 2015 UTC,I would love to learn Punjabi. I was born in Lahore and most of my parent's friends are super Punjabi but my family has more Afghan/Kashmiri roots I guess so my parents never spoke Punjabi with me when I was growing up. I feel like I'm missing out whenever I go back to Lahore.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,bug-bear,3,Fri Apr 24 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"I've never been to Lahore (or anywhere else in Pakistan), but once my Punjabi improves I definitely want to make a trip there since it sounds like a super interesting place from what I've heard. When I told my grand-dad I wanted to learn Punjabi, he said ""you should learn Urdu if you want to sound civilized"" because Punjabi is a ""ruthless language."""
ABCDesis,33mx8i,asdfioho,4,Fri Apr 24 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"aw :( my mom and her older sister know Punjabi, apparently my grandfather was all 'we are Punjabi FIRST'. He apparently didn't care as much with the last two kids haha. They all know Urdu though. I can understand Punjabi but cant speak it."

ABCDesis,33mx8i,skeptic54,3,Fri Apr 24 01:44:58 2015 UTC,it's a pretty common sentiment among Pakistani people these days from what I understand
ABCDesis,33mx8i,brandysnifter,3,Fri Apr 24 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Among many Punjabi Sikhs (my family at least), Punjabi is considered our proud language and Urdu/Hindi are written off as snobby and enforced. I enjoy media from both languages, but I prefer and am more comfortable with Punjabi. Something about how the words roll off the tongue is what gets me the most.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTKWGle9iKo&spfreload=10  Here's a really great song (devotional Sufi I think) by a Pakistani singer in Punjabi. It's always my response to those who view Punjabi as some hard rustic language. Baba Farid and Bulleh Shah's poetry is also quite nice"
ABCDesis,33mx8i,shannondoah,6,Fri Apr 24 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love the way Punjabi sounds, which is why I'm set on learning Punjabi and not Urdu."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,brandysnifter,3,Fri Apr 24 02:33:27 2015 UTC,I've heard this too. It makes me sad that Punjabis could say this about their own mother tongue.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,shannondoah,7,Fri Apr 24 05:35:40 2015 UTC,"If someone speaks to me in Bengali I feel happy that I am included and accepted as a Bengali person, especially when some Desi people will doubt my heritage or ""Bengaliness"" because I am mixed and born and raised in the US. I will respond to the best of my ability even though my Bengali skills are poor.  Now if someone gives me shit for not being able to speak Bengali well or my even more limited Hindi, I'll get pissed as hell. They don't know my background or experiences. They don't know I grew up in a mixed household where English was the lingua franca. They don't know how much effort I actively put in learning my parents' languages because I did not grow up speaking them. And every Indian is not required to know Hindi. As much as people kid themselves, it is not a ""national"" language, and I don't live in India where it is useful to communicate between different ethnic groups, so I don't have a compulsion to know it, except out of my own personal interest."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,brandysnifter,2,Fri Apr 24 00:41:19 2015 UTC,What about your Armenian?Better/worse than your Bengali?  (My Bengaliness is doubted often because of my diet).
ABCDesis,33mx8i,shannondoah,2,Sat Apr 25 04:07:06 2015 UTC,"At one point my Armenian was far better than my Bengali (childhood fluency) but now I don't remember much, sadly.  What's your diet like? More Telugu-influence? I have a hugely varied diet because I'm obsessed with food, but lately, I've been finding that I've been defaulting to a more hardcore traditional Bengali foods."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,TeslaModelE,2,Sat Apr 25 04:16:18 2015 UTC,Gone to the ilish stage yet? My little sister's has.  Mine is more coastal Andhra influenced though.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,Nylese,2,Sat Apr 25 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"Oh honey I been at the ilish stage since I was a kid, except it's too expensive where I live - $12+/lb (₹1700+/kg) - to eat it regularly."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,PurpleHaze7,2,Sat Apr 25 04:43:14 2015 UTC,I'm kinda moving away from it due to...personal reasons.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,hdpq,5,Sat Apr 25 04:49:48 2015 UTC,Never a problem for me. What I usually face is when someone assumes I speak Urdu. I don't. And I don't understand it really either. I've been getting this one for over 10 years.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,Tipoe,3,Thu Apr 23 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"I feel bad like I'm gonna let them down because I can only speak English, but once it's passed who cares."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,book-of-kells,3,Thu Apr 23 20:50:12 2015 UTC,I met an Afghan guy at uni and he started speaking Urdu to me once he found out I'm Pakistani. It was awkward for me at first but after a while it was fine. We'd switch back to Danish all the time though as both of us can express ourselves better in that language.   It's the same when I speak English to strangers since I'm more used to writing it rather than speaking it. It gets better after a while though.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,badmintonnewbie,3,Fri Apr 24 00:02:16 2015 UTC,Really the only place this happens to me is in taxis.  Most taxi drivers are Indian and those that talk to me assume I know Hindi.  So they start talking to me in Hindi.  I tell them I only speak English and understand Gujarati.   So usually they say a few Gujarati words and I arrive at my destination.
ABCDesis,33mx8i,oinkyy,3,Fri Apr 24 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"Most Asians in my hometown are Gujarati, so many times I've had Gujarati spoken at me when I don't understand it :')"
ABCDesis,33mx8i,LotusEyes92,3,Fri Apr 24 09:37:29 2015 UTC,"I get random people, often Surinamese, trying to speak Hindi to me but I can't answer back at all, since I don't speak Hindi.  I can speak (and read, to some extent) Tamil though."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,CisternaChyli,3,Fri Apr 24 08:37:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe she was not confident enough about her Kannada.  For me personally, I always find it a little odd that people, usually other Indian Americans, use Hindi with me - when I don't really speak it. (maybe I should just reply back in heavy Malayalam)"
ABCDesis,33mx8i,CisternaChyli,3,Fri Apr 24 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"OP, is there any chance she could have just been taken aback by hearing Kannada when her ears aren't used to it? I know that sometimes when I haven't spoken Kannada in a long time, my brain just is a little jarred by hearing it (when it expects English) and I get a bit flustered."
ABCDesis,33mx8i,burgeoning_philosoph,2,Fri Apr 24 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this so much, down to the exact language. I mostly speak in English even with my Kannada friends because I spend most of my time speaking in English and I also forget who is Kannada and who isn't.  If a guy spoke to me in Kannada I think I would have a similar reaction to her but I would be excited at the same time. It all has to be natural though. There was this girl once who wanted to improve her Kannada and wanted me to speak in it and it felt forced and awkward. Also, if I've met you before and we spoke in English and then you suddenly switch to Kannada that would take a lot of getting used to as well.   Usually my instinct is to speak in English with people my age, even if they are Indian and Kannada in particular. So I would be surprised and definitely awkward if people around us couldn't understand Kannada."

He was a white guy and as he was scanning my ticket before I boarded the plane..he said a few phrases to me in hindi. I was like 'WTF!'.  He didn't simply say a few words. Seemed like this guy could talk,albeit with a thick accent. Of course I don't speak Hindi that well, but understood what he said.  So I had to give him that blank stare."

Traditional South Asian diets which are carb heavy def play a part, But its not very encouraging to read that my genetics are def not helping too.

ABCDesis,33ni4x,RotiRoll,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"I read an article about this a while ago, where they claimed that this hadn't been tested in vivo.  Basically, the (coconut) oil is supposed to form a layer around the starch and that way prevent an enzyme into breaking it down to glucose. According to the article I read, the people behind this research had overlooked the fact that fat gets digested in the small intestine and hence the starch would be available for the enzyme (and be broken down to glucose).  So, we can't really conclude anything about the glucose uptake before it is tested in vivo. We can expect a lower glycemic index though - according to the article."
ABCDesis,33ni4x,PurpleHaze7,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:44:09 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. If works as they claim, it's worth considering. If not I don't see the point in adding coconut oil and eating reheated rice because reheated white rice is sadness in carb form."
ABCDesis,33ni4x,oinkyy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"I smell shit!   Carbs and fat are digested in drastically different ways. I'm not going to believe a word of this until it's tested in vivo. Although it's generally good to eat protein + fats with your simple carbs (to slow down the absorption and keep you fuller longer) I don't believe a single thing about actually absorbing fewer calories until some bodyweight studies are done using this method.

I'm not sure what you mean by rice dishes, I usually eat it with lentils. My mom says she'll use it for rice dishes like biryani and such (but adds she doesn't do it when she has company over lol).

ABCDesis,33hp23,TeslaModelE,6,Wed Apr 22 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"What is your skin care regiment? If you say nothing, we may have found the root of your problem. First things first, are you moisturizing? If you aren't do it. I don't get a lot of acne, but just doing that practically wiped it out. I use neutragena sunblock thing in the morning. Doesn't matter if it is cloudy or not. It is good for your skin and it moisturizes. When I go to bed I just wash my face but use a towel to lightly scrub my face when I dry it off. This last bit can really make a difference for a lot of people. Change your pillow cases every other day, that or put a towel over them each night.   Water, drink lots of it. Your skin produces oil to help keep your skin moisturized and protect it. Moisturizing and drinking lots of water to be well hydrated keeps the skin healthy and will cause your body to produce less oil.  Also, the diet bit - how much greasy food are you eating? It isn't always just starchy food. Sugar and greasy food make can cause a lot of acne."
ABCDesis,33hp23,hahaheehaha,2,Wed Apr 22 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"I use cetaphil wash in the morning and benzoyl peroxide at night. I drink a ton of water and that's the only liquid in my diet. I'm going to start changing the pillow case more often. Also, I don't currently moisturize since my face is usually oily. Always seemed counterproductive.   I eat healthy for the most part and don't eat any processed sugar. But I do eat naan and paratha and kabobs and stuff. And white rice. And raw green veggies. I've tried eliminating all that stuff and there was no meaningful difference."
ABCDesis,33hp23,hahaheehaha,8,Wed Apr 22 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, classic misconception. The oiliness is caused because of a lack of moisturizing. Also, with the amount of skin drying products you are using, it could also ironically be causing your skin to become so oily. So try doing the cetaphil wash in the morning while you shower. Then when you get ready to head out put on the sunblock. The neutrogena one I recommended isn't greasy at all. Give it about a week or two and you should notice the oiliness of your face will start to go down. Honestly, I would recommend just using regular soap to wash your face in the morning, use sunblock, and then do the wash and/or the peroxide at night."
ABCDesis,33hp23,pomegranita,7,Wed Apr 22 18:54:26 2015 UTC,Just want to say to be careful with regular soap. Some soaps can be drying and break down your acid mantle/moisture barrier (especially if the pH is higher than 5.5). I think the Cetaphil one should be good (for morning and evening).
ABCDesis,33hp23,immilaw,4,Wed Apr 22 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"I would try salicylic acid instead of BP, which I read can be really harsh on your skin.  /u/hahaheehaha's pillowcase tip is great.  I want to add that instead of using towels (pain to wash all the time and they shift away from my pillow at night), I buy Hanes men's large undershirt (the white cotton kind) and put that over my pillow, flip sides the following night and toss it in the wash.  It's pretty cheap and easy to wash."
ABCDesis,33hp23,pomegranita,5,Wed Apr 22 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm 24/F and in my case it's hormonal & genetic (genetically, my hormones cause me to produce more sebum which causes acne). I have been struggling with bad skin since I was 20 and finally have semi-clear skin now.  I haven't read any proper research but afaik there are 2 things to take into account   dairy contains hormones which can influence acne there is a connection between simple carbs/sugar and acne   I eat parboiled basmati rice to avoid simple carbs. It tastes just like white basmati rice but the glycemic index is much lower.   If you have never had good skin in your entire life, I wouldn't personally assume it has much to do with diet, but would look at other factors such as hormones or lifestyle (e.g. not enough sleep, stress). It could be a combination of different things as well. You know your skin best, so if you think it has to do with diet you could be right as well.  If you don't have a good skincare routine I would really look into that first. Also make sure you have a healthy lifestyle (enough sleep, healthy diet, no stress, plenty of water), change your pillowcases as much as you can, avoid touching your face and consider if it's hormonal/genetic. /r/AsianBeauty & /r/SkincareAddiction have been super helpful to me."

I have heard that white basmati rice is pre-cooked a certain way which gives way for the sugars/starches to come free, which causes it to be higher on the glycemic index, and that parboiled rice is pre-cooked differently and therefore is healthier but I have no idea of the technique.   You have to use extra water (so I use 2 cups of water with 1 cup of rice, whereas if I cook basmati rice I use 1 cup of water with 1 cup of rice), but I just buy it and cook it regularly. Now I hope it is truly healthy and I'm not doing something wrong, lol."

With all due respect, many of these suggestions sound like old wives' tales,That said, staying healthy, hydrated, and active is important for everyone. Disclaimer: I'm an internal medicine resident, not a dermatologist. But I do have a solid understanding of acne, since I've struggled with it since the age of 12, with some improvement over the years.   How would you assess your acne based on this scale?  Accutane is usually a last resort treatment method that's recommended under the guidance of a dermatologist after other treatment methods have failed, given its potential for severe side effects. Moreover, it's usually reserved for severe nodular-cystic acne..from your description, getting ""a pimple"" here and there doesn't cut it. In my experience, topical retinoids are immensely beneficial. They're usually costly though, even with insurance, so my mother returns with several tubes with it after her yearly trips to the subcontinent. Inbox me if you'd like more information about my struggle with acne or have any questions."

ABCDesis,33hp23,JenniferHewitt,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Whoah bro....why you freaking out then? Haha, just kidding, but it sounds like your acne is MILD, not even moderate, and this is not uncommon even in people in their late 20's. My suggestion as per the treatment algorithm would be a topical retinoid. You should consult with your primary care physician about this, since these things are available only by prescription. The various brand names are Differin, Renova, Retin-A, and there are a few others. They're very similar, although some dermatologists might argue that one type is superior to the other, but only marginally so. Keep in mind that skincare isn't my area of expertise, but as an internist, I'm familiar with the general management of acne.  Do you have insurance? Without insurance, these things from around $60 (generic tretinon) to $350 for the fancy brand names (Retin-A micro), although they have comparable efficacy as I mentioned before. Or you could do what I do, and bring some tubes back from India/Pakistan, which are OTC over there."

And, no county in the entire state is now majority Republican, and even more shocking is that if the trends of the next decade mirror the last, ""no party preference"" voters would be second largest voter base, and the Rep Party here would be the third largest party. This is not going to happen in just Cal, it would start in Cal but soon you might see a lot of voters nationally registering as independents."

The game has changed so much since 1994, dude.  OP was about moving to Seattle now not moving to SF 21 years ago. If OP is someone with no allegiance to a team, moving to a town with arguably the most dominant team of the last 4 years and a possibility of multiple SB appearances in the future is appealing, not unappealing.  Also, most Seattle fans weren't even born when the niners won their last championship (see, we are cool with poking fun at our fan base) :P"
ABCDesis,33gmds,analystdude,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"I blame the 49ers management. If you want to own a team for the novelty of it, then stay the hell out of running the team. Just wait a few years, you guys will suffer the same fate.   I think my annoyance with Seahawk fans is the extreme bandwagoning and the fb posts that litter my newsfeed that accompany it. I'll wait another few years when a key player leaves or management fucks you guys over and the posts become more tempered. Till then, I will remain annoyed by the young, fresh, idealistic bandwagon fans that believe the Seahawks will forever be the NFL superpower."
ABCDesis,33gmds,hahaheehaha,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel bad for Niners fans. I really do. So many bad decisions from management - it's not even funny.  I also hate bandwagoners, not two seconds after the Pats won the SB my FB feed was full of ""Pats4Lyf"" posts. But you must remember that success brings fan following.   For the longest time the bandwagoners attached themselves to the Steelers, Niners and Cowboys. My wife's from ATL and the number of Niners shirts I saw in ATL were ridiculous. In the last decade or so it has been the Pats and now it's the Seahawks.  You must also remember that only 32 cities can have ""their team"", the rest of the country will just latch on to whoever is successful. I've seen annoying Niners fans, respectful Niners fans, annoying Seahawks fans and respectful Seahawks fans. Any generalization of any fan base is going to be like generalizing any group of people - i.e. untrue."

ABCDesis,33gmds,elle_reve,2,Wed Apr 22 20:11:58 2015 UTC,Used to live there- it's great! Do you have more specific questions?
ABCDesis,33gmds,touaregwanderlust,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:59:04 2015 UTC,How's the cost of living compared to say Bay Area or where you live now? How did you find the constant rain? I am guessing there is plenty of outdoorsy stuff to do right? Is there anything you disliked living there?
ABCDesis,33gmds,immilaw,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"Cost Of Living: * Housing/Rent was lower in Seattle than the Bay Area * Other expenses were on par except for food which is more expensive in Seattle compared to bay area * No State Income tax! This is a HUGE deal.  * Multicultural + lots of desi restaurants, activities, etc.  The constant rain isn't too bad - it's usually mostly drizzle. You do definitely need to get used to long periods of time with clouds and no sun. Summer is amazing though.  In terms of activities, there is a plethora of things to do. There are a lot of amazing trails and things to do on the lake in the summer.   Here's why I didn't decide to stay in Seattle: * Seattle felt like a company town for the field that I am in (tech) and conversations and activities were centered around your company. Although I would make more take-home pay, the opportunities were limiting. This is getting better though.  * The weather  It's a great place though.   Let me know if you have any other questions!"

California is out of the question for us.  I can avoid taking the bar and just waive in.  So we are considering moving there. Seattle seems to be a great place to live."
ABCDesis,33gmds,immilaw,2,Wed Apr 22 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why we were considering it as well, but then we got a house and settled where we are  :)  It was nice when I visited. I'm not a big city person at all - NYC and San Fran are not my thing. Seattle was big but it was clean which was amazing. Everything in the city is walkable, you don't really need a car - or, maybe just one, but parking would suck. I don't know if I'd be able to handle the lack of sun, though. Rain is more of a...drizzle or mist, than actual rain. I'm also not a coffee drinker, which everyone seems to be.   Husband's friends who did move (and also a couple of my friends there) have said it's not easy to make friends - that people are more closed off than where we are. But we're in the south.  I believe /u/analystdude is from there?"
ABCDesis,33gmds,bug-bear,6,Wed Apr 22 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"I am indeed from there!  /u/immilaw - the thing about Seattle freeze is that it's kind of true. People attribute it to different things - weather, the scandinavian ancestry of most Seattleites, the city being full of geeks, etc.  But in my own experience that's changing. Especially because now the city of Seattle is mostly made of transplants who moved here for a job/school (thanks to Amazon's hiring spree and other big companies opening up sattelite offices). So there's ALWAYS something going on and meetup.com always has something for young couples.  You're obvs, also welcome to hangout with us if you ever move here. My wife and I were just talking about how we have ZERO couple friends and all our friends are single and skew much younger.  As for your inter-racial couple-ness, I feel like it's more or less the norm here. I feel like my wife and I (desi-desi) are more of an exception than the norm. Like /u/bug-bear said, the city is super walkable and well connected by public transit. It's also super liberal and people are very friendly to strangers, but in a I'll make small talk but won't even be BFFs with you kinda way, which to me is just perfect.  If you live in the 'burbs though, it's a different story. There are different suburbs with different characteristics.  If you're considering buying a house, the market is getting into ""This shit is ridiculous"" territory, but not as bad as the bay-area or NYC.  And since I love making lists.  Pros of moving to Seattle:   If you live in the city, it's one of the most vibrant cities in the country. There are a lot of restaurants, bars (of all kinds - ranging from fancy cocktail bars to cheap ass dive bars). If you love beer, there are a ton of craft breweries. It was rated the #4 best city for Young Adults Coffee culture Cost of living not as insane as SF/NY, but you still get the big city life The summer (though short) is GORGEOUS. The winters are not as bad as NE States My hometown is better than yours Seattle Seahawks Seattle Sounders   Cons of moving to Seattle:   If you're planning on buying houses, the market is starting to get unaffordable Well, 6-8 months of rain Seattle freeze 4th worst traffic in the country Seattleites have a reputation for being smug, hipster, assholes   Coming from a biased Seattleite who loves his city - pros massively outweigh cons. Move here - you'll be depressed for 8 months, but it's totally worth it for the 4 months of amazing summer time."

ABCDesis,33gmds,frackaracka,2,Wed Apr 22 18:31:13 2015 UTC,Question for Desi Muslims:  Do you guys speak Arabic or do you only know the Classical Arabic for reading the Quran?
ABCDesis,33gmds,Shinobhi,2,Wed Apr 22 19:05:14 2015 UTC,Non-believer but Muslim family. Can't speak Arabic but we were taught to read it without properly understanding what it meant.
ABCDesis,33gmds,Tipoe,2,Wed Apr 22 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's interesting! How come the difference from family? Genuinely curious :o"
ABCDesis,33gmds,x6tance,3,Thu Apr 23 10:44:02 2015 UTC,"To start with my parents are not very devout or religious, but they would still say they are Muslims. This meant growing up I wasn't constantly being taught things which my fellow Pakistanis were, and religion didn't come up often in our household.   As for me, I never bought into it with conviction. I had probably a childlike belief in God, but when I thought about it seriously, realised I didn't believe. This was probably around the age of 15 or 16.   It never made sense to me, and the more I read about Islam, the less convinced I was. Especially learning about the details of heaven/hell, it simply sounded like a myth to me, like any of the thousands of others myths humans have told over the years.   That's the long and short of it. A lack of evidence keeps me in my current position; if you want to know more specific stuff feel free to ask :)"
ABCDesis,33gmds,Tipoe,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:17:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, 11 days off, lol! But, I finally thought of a question or three after stumbling across another Desi Muslim who doesn't believe in Islam much/identifies themselves as culturally Muslim. (I swear, this is a common theme on Reddit in places like here, /r/india, /r/Pakistan, etc)   Here are ze questions!   Have you ever tried immersing yourself in Islam and learning all about it before you decided to identify yourself as a non-believer?  Are you a 2nd Gen Paki?  Bonus question: How do you feel when a non-Pakistani calls you Paki? Is there leeway for an Indian Muslim? :p"
ABCDesis,33gmds,x6tance,2,Mon May 4 14:55:04 2015 UTC,"Nope but I didn't need to, to disavow the idea. I learnt more about Islam, and read the Quran in full, after disbelieving. Before that, it was a very rudimental understanding of the religion (but that wasn't a factor in leaving).    It's like how you haven't immersed yourself in Sikhism before disbelieving it (I assume).   Yeah, parents are from Pakistan. It depends on the context. In the UK, 'paki' is offensive, historically used by white people against anyone of South Asian descent. My Indian friends get away with it sometimes, as a joke, and sometimes us Pakistanis use the word to refer to ourselves self-deprecatingly.    But no, there isn't leeway for being Muslim.  Hope this helps :)"
ABCDesis,33gmds,Tipoe,2,Mon May 4 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yup! Appreciate the responses, mate! :)  So, you left Islam cause you never held on to it tightly growing up and you took interest in reading the Qu'ran after leaving it? That is interesting!    What made you want to learn back after you dismissed it? :o * Did anything change after you read it. Did you read it with a bias? Lol! <_< Do any of your Desi Muslim friends or family know? Do they care or treat you differently?   Ahhh, blast. I was hoping to get away with it since many Pakistanis mistaken me as one cause of my name and looks. :/"
ABCDesis,33gmds,x6tance,3,Mon May 4 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"I just find it interesting, the Quran must be one of the most important texts ever compiled. So why not read it?   I don't know about bias but of course it's different reading it whilst believing in God and whilst being an atheist. Passages that will inspire awe in a believers, make me feel 'this bit is poetic/beautiful'. Nothing changed in terms of my belief, if anything it confirmed it.   I think I'll read it again this summer in more detail, maybe taking notes as well.   My family think I'm 'doubting', it doesn't come up much. (None of my cousins/uncles/aunts/grandparents are in the UK). My sister is the same as me, my brother doesn't care about anything other than Minecraft right now.   As for friends, a few Muslim friends know. They don't treat me differently but I'm not close with them, so maybe it would be different if I were. I don't have really close Muslim friends at the moment.  And the situation is different in the USA regarding that word."

This whole idea of women taming men down and preventing violence is just sexist and messed up in so many ways. Are gay bars somehow more violent than straight bars? Or do gay men somehow lose their testosterone and are more feminine because you know, we all live in the 50s?  All-male enclaves are not more prone to violence by necessity. Most all-male enclaves that are violent are designed that way. Prisoners, soldiers, sweatshop workers live in all-male ghettos which are meant to either engage in violence or have conditions which lead to violence (lack of freedom, feeling of being trapped, unrestricted power to those in charge). Engineering schools, golf clubs, sports teams are not more prone to violence despite being frequently all-male.   India and China of the 21st century are not the first societies in the world to have faced skewed sex ratios. US of the early 20th century was very heavily male due to high immigration from Europe which tended to be heavily male. But it didn't devolve into mob rule. If anything, early 20th century US was on the fast road to prosperity. America's per capita industrial production was almost four times that of Germany, the most industrialized country in Europe back then, when WWI started.  South Korea, since the war till the early 90s, had a heavily skewed sex ratio thanks to a similar son preference. Again, this was a period of high economic growth for the country. There is nothing to indicate that South Korea faced disproportionate crime during that era.   Given how little logic and history is used in most articles about this phenomenon, this theory of increased crime rates seems grounded in the idea that ""those weird Asian people remain barely humans when they have sex and turn into monsters when they don't get that anymore"". Fuck that noise. Maybe Indian and Chinese men will have to work harder to get women and as a result, economies of these countries would flourish."
ABCDesis,33f7i3,frackaracka,8,Wed Apr 22 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Your comment prompted me to run some casual Google searches. Dislcaimer: this is what I've found from blog posts, not rigorous academic discussion, so take everything with a grain of salt.  From what I understand, the problem is not that men are inherently violent so much as it is the demand and supply of sexual (and hence, marital) relations. Your example of gay bars wouldn't apply because presumably gay sex is more available in gay bars than straight sex is available in straight bars. (Incidentally that was the driving force behind the explosion of the gay bathhouse and hookup culture in the '90s...but that's a separate discussion.)  So regarding increased male violence...you have a point. This article says that a study found males actually adjusted their behavior to compete in a more nonviolent way for the remaining available mates. How that reconciles with the cultural framework is another story, though, and not one that I can easily find an answer to. Life in India and China is tough enough as it is, even under ideal gender ratios. So while men's behavior may not be inherently violent, the societal conditions that make life difficult (i.e. poverty) may foster a violent reaction, which makes it a relevant cause for concern. China may fare better than India in this respect because its authoritarian government can ramp up changes faster than India can.  By the way, this is also interesting to note, from the same article:   They believe their study has important policy implications. For example, “tough on crime” policies that incarcerate increasing numbers of men might be contributing to higher rates of violence, rather than alleviating them, the authors say.   Also, the early 20th century of the US was heavily characterized by organized crime. Whether that's related to the gender ratio I can't say, but it was definitely a violent period. Its rapid industrialization is what helped propel it forward (which, again: China).  But your example of South Korea might be a ray of hope. This article here gives a brief overview:   South Korea's restored balance, while retaining a male dominance that remains above the accepted biological range (and with greater imbalances persisting among babies born to older mothers), is attributed to the simultaneous introduction of economic, social and legal initiatives.   I tried to Google what those initiatives might be, but this post is probably long enough for now. If India can introduce and reinforce similar measures then there might be hope for a turnaround."
ABCDesis,33f7i3,akbar-great_chai-tea,4,Wed Apr 22 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've been doing some sniffing around academic databases too, and it's also worth noting that a study of ""bare branches"" men in Guizhou found them to have no greater propensity to violence, but were instead shy, lonely, withdrawn, and more likely to be depressed. We may indeed be completely wrong to assume that a surplus of young men entails increased violence:   The combination of psychological vulnerability and sexual frustration might lead to aggression and violence. There is empirical support for this prediction: gender is a well-established individual-level correlate of crime, especially violent crime [30,31]. A consistent finding across cultures is that most crime is perpetrated by young, single males, of low socioeconomic status [32]. A particularly intriguing study carried out in India in the early 1980s showed that the sex ratio at the state level correlated strongly with homicide rates, and the relationship persisted after controlling for confounders such as urbanization and poverty [33]. The authors had expected to find that the high sex ratio would lead to increased violence against women, but their conclusion was that high sex ratios are a cause of violence of all types in society.  However, no other study has found similar results. The study mentioned above from rural Guizhou, for example, could find no evidence that unmarried men were especially prone to violence and aggression. Rather, the men were characterized as shy and withdrawn, rather than aggressive [29]. In addition, reports of crime and disorder are not higher in areas with a known excess of young, single men. This might be because there is not yet a large enough crucial mass of unmarriageable men to have an impact, or assumptions about male aggression do not apply in this context.   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/embor.2012.62/full"

ABCDesis,33f7i3,frackaracka,2,Wed Apr 22 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"Great work! I have done similar searches before every time a similar article was published and my conclusions have also been similar.   My problem with this viewpoint is that despite there being no historical or anthropological evidence that an increase in violence is inevitable, it just seems like an accepted viewpoint. Nobody seems willing to challenge the assertion and say that maybe an increase in violence due to lack of long term relationships for men is not so inevitable.   If correlation can be substituted for causation, it actually seems to be the reverse. Inner city American neighborhoods have more women than men, partly because of America's love affair with incarceration of Black and Hispanic men, and have higher rates of violence. Post-Soviet countries often have highly skewed sex ratios with more women and they are also considerably more violent (the skewed sex ratio is due to men dying earlier due to alcoholism). So there is at least as much evidence that more women can lead to more violence (from men).   This really seems like imposition of some 50s' Utopian ideal that nuclear families with 2.5 kids is the model that makes everyone happy and any deviation from that will lead society to collapse through violence."
ABCDesis,33f7i3,KaliYugaz,-1,Wed Apr 22 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"This could turn out to be a good thing down the road. The status of women will increase due to their newfound leverage (never mind, research is unclear), and caste, class, and racial boundaries will be diluted for want of marriageable partners. The female shortage could result in fewer births, bringing future populations down to manageable levels, raising demand for labor, and increasing wages.  And as for the excess men becoming criminals, all they have to do is take a page out of 'Murica's book and instate a system of mass incarceration. I hear it's a big business."
ABCDesis,33f7i3,frackaracka,14,Wed Apr 22 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the status of women never increases in situations like these. They become more like chattel, whose ""value"" is determined and priced by their family. The excess men then turn to buying women - sex trafficking faces a huge upturn. (This is all already happening, by the way.) Women (and subsequently, men) fare best in a society that is in equilibrium."
ABCDesis,33f7i3,KaliYugaz,-1,Wed Apr 22 03:35:16 2015 UTC,Hence the need for mass incarceration. I don't see any other feasible solution if the excess men do in fact turn violent.

Otherwise it's the same as putting a band-aid over a hole and hoping the dam doesn't burst.  I do see what you're saying about the immediate short-term remedy. I don't think that mass incarceration is the answer - the majority of the men who would be jailed would predominantly hail from the lower classes, which would only reinforce class and caste differences and cause further destabilization. The angry and violent men would only get more angry and more violent."

Beef and lamb will, the first time you eat it, will give you acid reflux or some upset stomach.   I promise you this: When I gave up beef/pork/chicken, my health always improves, and my weight goes down. I don't get any weaker, but my belts are tightened since I lost weight. Meat makes me retain water, and I personally think that I'm swollen up with inflammation."
ABCDesis,33el1f,alwaysLearning1984,2,Wed Apr 22 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"I was raised fairly conservative vegetarian. My mother is particularly neurotic, being from an orthodox Brahmin family and all. But I have health issues which mean that I cannot eat many types of veggies, fruits and fibre because they make me ill. So I had to transition to SOME meat at least out of desperation.  I've been eating chicken for quite some time, then I added fish to my repetoire. Unlike one of the posters below I went like this: chicken>salmon>other fish>St. Jacques (didn't like them at all, though)>lamb>other meats. I've grown to love salmon, even more than chicken. Salmon sushi is the best! Lamb is pretty okay as well, but it's hard to digest. I generally won't eat pork because it's unhealthy, and beef because...well, you know. I'm not religious but it's SUCH a taboo that I have a hard time touching it. I have tasted rabbit and it's a bit like chicken but a much stronger, gamey flavour.   In general I find transitioning very hard, though. I find it difficult to get used to the 'meaty' and 'fishy' smells. They almost make me retch sometimes. I also dislike the textures. Still, I prefer seafood because it tastes like the sea, which brings back all sorts of nostalgic feelings of spending my childhood by the sea. :-)  I have to add that my SO is French and he helps me transition by letting me try new flavours and things. He is also very understanding that I'm not used to eating meat and that it takes time."
ABCDesis,33el1f,asoons,3,Wed Apr 22 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"yeah, there was a period of about two weeks where i went through a rebellious phase and tried alcohol once and meat a few times. i ate chicken and pork. i didn't like the taste of either or how it made me feel - not just emotionally or spiritually, like how gandhi said he heard the cries of the goat he'd eaten after trying meat his first and only time, but also physically. i felt mentally and physically sluggish. after a few times, i realized i was being stupid, and it wasn't worth sacrificing my ethical commitments/religious beliefs. i still haven't mentioned it to my parents, even though this was a couple of years ago. they're generally forgiving and understanding, so i know they wouldn't make a deal of it, but it would still wound them."
ABCDesis,33el1f,alwaysLearning1984,2,Wed Apr 22 09:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. I switched over about a year ago. I do weight training and need to eat lots of meat is a requirement to gain muscle. I was 27 or 28 when I switched. Don't particularly enjoy eating meat (chicken, lamb and fish), but I get good strength gains from it so I keep it up. If I could be veg and still lift weights, then I'd do that.   First dish: don't remember but probably grilled chicken sandwich. In terms of Indian food I eat a lot of andra style curries. I like spicy and sour food."
ABCDesis,33el1f,blazerz,2,Wed Apr 22 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"how much protein do you consume now? if you're content with an intake around 225g and have no issues with dairy, i think you could still make a vegetarian diet work. that's around what i consume right now, and i make it work with dairy, lentils and beans, grains, and nuts/seeds. but i only weigh around 150 lbs (started off at 135), and i'm aiming to get to 175 in two or three years. it's been sufficient for me to make consistent gains in weight and in the major lifts through the beginner phase, but i understand that a vegetarian diet likely makes it more difficult to reach potential gains. i'm ok with that because weight training is just one part of a training regimen for a sport for me, and the religious reasons for remaining vegetarian, despite its potential limitations, are important to me."
ABCDesis,33el1f,x6tance,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Cool. I try to consume around 200 g a day while cutting and +300g when I'm trying to gain. What are you gains in your main compound lifts? (Bench, OHP, Squat and Deadlift). I really hope what you're saying is true because I'd love to switch back to a vegetarian diet. What does your diet look like?"
ABCDesis,33el1f,crazygama,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"300g might be tough while also keeping carbs relatively low/moderate level. this is what my diet looks like at around 225g of protein (probably more actually):  breakfast: 1 cup of greek yogurt + almonds/walnuts/cashews (sometimes pumpkin seeds instead) 1 cup of oats  lunch: 1 cup of cottage cheese pongal (usually .5 cup of brown rice/quinoa, .5 cup of split moong dal, more if hungry) + cashews/almonds/walnuts some kind of curry (chana masala) or sambar (toor dal) as side dish  dinner: 1 cup of greek yogurt sprouted bean soup (usually i let .5-1 cup of mung beans/black beans to sprout over a day or two, or use a red+green lentil combo if i'm running short of time) with whatever vegetables i can throw in   just before sleep: 2 cups of milk    there you go. there isn't a lot of variety i guess, unless you can switch around varieties of lentils/beans or use different spices and vegetables. dairy is also a large source of protein. it works for me, but i understand that it might not be ideal for others. i try to make a large batch of pongal/soup/sambar during the weekend so that i don't have to cook too often during the week.   i started stronglifts around 4.5 months ago, the weights listed below are for 5rm. i haven't tested 1rm yet. body weight: (132-135 -> 145-148) squat: 125 -> 215 (the lift i like the most, i already did a lot of sprints and had decent leg strength) deadlifts: 135 -> 230 (this should be higher for my squat but i'm not confident of my form, so i've had to deload a couple of times to start over with improved form) bench: 75 -> 135 (i've always had terrible upper body strength, this is a problem area) ohp: bar -> 95"
ABCDesis,33el1f,crazygama,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That is good progress. I did starting strength, and did GOMAD to push my weight up. I felt eating meat was a necessity, but I think I'll experiment with your approach of milk/yogurt + various lentils/veggie proteins. Frankly eating meat was the worst part of running the program."

ABCDesis,33czmt,akbar-great_chai-tea,8,Tue Apr 21 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"I have been lurking for sometime and lately, the temptation to write has compelled me a few times to barge into discussions.   27, Minneapolis, family originally from West Bengal in India but have lived at a lot of different places over the years in India.  Came to the US for grad school; in the process of finishing that up and looking for people to hire me despite the additional burden of sponsoring visas I am new to Reddit and have been exploring it for a few months. I used to be busy on Quora for sometime but the website took a turn for the worse and I didn't think it was discussion-friendly anymore.   Reddit is a better place because different subreddits have different rules and different levels of etiquette are expected. I am good with ABCDesis and its level of moderation. Keeps it civil while allowing for different points of view.   Reading up and learning about history; have an abiding interest in cooking and looking to get back into baking (cakes mostly, also cheesecakes); watching slow movies (like Latin American, 'few precious words' kind of slow), biking on trails and general reading (mostly fiction but increasingly non-fiction) are not exactly hobbies/interests but stuff that I enjoy doing in my free time. I love heated arguments and don't do ad hominem attacks but might come across as hostile sometimes even when its not my intention. I do intentionally come across as hostile when I perceive any kind of bigotry. That shit makes me really angry and I don't care to fight fair when people propel sexist or racist stuff. That was one problem I had with Quora. Lots of White, SF-brand liberals pedaling casual racism and crying ""White girl tears"" when accused of racism.    Like seriously, someone actually said that I was being racist against her when I pointed out that her graceless generalization about people she has never met in real life definitely amounts to prejudice and maybe racism. Her argument was ""you are the one who sees race in this, so you are being racist"". Like how does that compute?   So, I thought I should give a disclaimer. I have seen people on this sub talk shit about Muslims or certain Indian ethnic groups that had made me mad."

Over the next few months, before I head of for college, I want to really focus on my Hindi skills, as well as learning music from my mother.  Although I am mostly fluent in Hindi, I lack confidence in a big way, and have trouble with more difficult language.  If I have time, it would be fun to learn some Sanskrit as well.  My mother is an Indian classical singer (hindustani), and one of my regrets is that I never learnt music from her, so hopefully I can learn at least a bit before college.

I am a student at the moment, though I do volunteer work for hospitals and end-of-life care. I came here because I wanted to learn more about being Indian American, and find people who thought like me; I want to learn more about Indian Americans in films (as well as Indian American films and literature) and in general, I want to feel more comfortable in my skin.  I am a big fan of Manga, Singing, Writing, Reading (my favorite author currently is Haruki Murakami -- make of that what you will), Running, and listening to really weird music. I also love having intimate conversations with people and learning about really strange, esoteric subjects. Working for NPR is my wet dream.  Other stuff... does anyone have an opinion on the new Kendrick Lamar album? I'd love to hear your opinions! And does anyone here listen to D'Angelo? I haven't found another Indian person that listens to D'Angelo, lol.  Thanks for reading this! Bye.  edit: Oh yeah, and I'm kind of a /u/anirvan fan. Random fact.

ABCDesis,33czmt,Tipoe,3,Wed Apr 22 18:28:47 2015 UTC,I've read Kafka on the shore and Norwegian Wood. I think his fantasy books are too weird for me but I really liked the latter. His writing style is amazing.   I listened to the new D'Angelo album but didn't really like it despite the great reviews :/
ABCDesis,33czmt,wizarrd,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:37:17 2015 UTC,"His writing style is amazing.   I'm pretty sure that's why I like him so much. I write a lot on my own, and to me, his books are half experience, half writing porn. He usually doesn't have a satisfying end, but I've always cared about the characters and the meaning more, and his work is excellent for both of those things. I understand the love for Norwegian Wood, but I like his other stuff better, personally. I like when his work is less grounded in reality; it gives me a chance to jump into a completely removed world, for a little while.  And that's fine! You listened to it! Solidarity, I'm not alone! YES! And I don't blame you for disliking it; it took me a long time to get used to the whole sound of everything. I probably wouldn't have spent so much time if I wasn't obsessed with copying exactly what he was singing, though.  The thing with that album is that you have to spend a lot of time with it to really get it -- and, for some people, you can only really listen to it when you're in the right mood. That's my impression of it, anyways.  What are your musical tastes? Even though you didn't much like Black Messiah, I figure that we have lots of tastes in Common."

ABCDesis,33cf95,elle_reve,4,Tue Apr 21 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"So, I'm guessing ""country"" is a placeholder for a Western country a user lives in and you're using Desi to mean any of the countries from South Asia. For those that might not have understood the question well! Essentially, it's a question of nationality and culture.  Good question. I identify myself as Indian. I prefer to be Indian. I see it more like a 60/40 split, tbh. I don't see myself as American. I mean, I do in some instances, but, I don't blend well with the society here. There are stark differences in me and a ""White/Anglo"" American. I've always seemed to get along with other minorities the best.   I have adopted an American accent which I love. And I enjoy many of the benefits and opportunities this country has provided me, but, I just don't feel an attachment to it like an ""American' would.   However, people view me in many ways. I'm kind of in awkward middle. A mix of NRI and ABCD, perhaps. If I hang around with 2nd gen Desis, people will see me as really Indian. If I hang out with my cousins in India, they'll see me as American, lol! If I hang out with ""Americans"", they'll always see the fact that I'm Indian. Sooo, I hope that answers it."

Excellent grades, a sport/achievement, and leadership activities these days are enough to get you into a good public university. But it's absolutely not enough for the Ivy League.  Not to mention the number of slots reserved for Ivy League legacies.

I do disagree about what you think are the merits to get into an Ivy/other ""top tier"" schools. The aforementioned qualifications in my other post are more than sufficient, and if you don't get in then you overestimated yourself by some metric. At the end of the day it's what you make of it. I approach legacy slots like the slots of those who play college sports, not relevant or pertinent to the general admission process. No one really cares about what school after your first job."
ABCDesis,33avy1,nosupport,5,Tue Apr 21 14:02:29 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree, then. The qualifications you mentioned are sufficient relative to who you are and where you're competing on a regional level. And look, I say this as someone who has interviewed and been accepted to Ivy League schools.   Once you get to be the person who even has a shot at being accepted to these schools, it's a complete crapshoot. It's highly dependent on who they're looking for to fill out their classes. I just don't want any high schoolers reading here to think that they aren't good enough - you are, and you have the rest of your life to prove it. Ivy League isn't the end-all, be-all of anything."
ABCDesis,33avy1,frackaracka,2,Tue Apr 21 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm ok with disagreeing. I don't think it is regional except maybe outliers like rural areas. I come from a similar region to the student in the article or others who get into Ivys regularly, which makes it almost necessary to outshine your peers. The ingredients I listed are certainly sufficient in any region, and to stand out. I'm not here to give false hope. It is a ton of work to satisfy those ingredients. I also don't think what school you go to should define you or anything like that. Like we both say, the college doesn't matter, it's what you do there."

Her ""stats"" are not actually that much of a stand-out at our school, the average SAT for our school is pretty high (above 2100 for sure, maybe above 2200). I have friends with 2400's and 4.5's who didn't get into any Ivies. My friend who got all A's in difficult courses, was a writing center tutor, had a 2300+, and was part of varsity soccer all four years and a captain for two and all he got was a waitlist at Cornell. Admissions was really rough this year overall, but Pooja came out on top because she had some absolutely stellar extracurriculars and accomplishments. That's generally an outlier though.  In all honesty, there's also a lot of subjectivity in admissions at that higher level. Some people who were very average applicants got into outstanding schools, and some people were absolutely screwed for the work they put in and the output they had. There's also the factors like race, legacy, women in engineering, etc.."

But yes, I am a senior at TJ! I do feel our culture's a bit snobby (we always refer to ourselves as ""TJ kids"" vs ""base school kids""), but it's a very different environment than a typical high school. According to my friends who applied to TJ their sophomore year and those who left TJ to attend their base high school, it's a much more academically intense environment as well (so much that our school does not do class rank, would just be too catastrophic) in that teachers assign more work (all our non-AP classes are honors, our ""normal"" physics is the AP Physics B course, we finish the Calculus BC course) several months earlier than the AP, etc) go at a faster pace, and you have a pretty competitive environment with students all scrambling for colleges. The hour-long commitment didn't help either.  This year, it's been pretty rough overall for college admissions as many people feel that they could have made it through high school with much less stress to attain the same result college-wise (we have a lot of people attending Ivies and such, but it's still super competitive and a lot of excellent kids are left in the dust).

We as a society are not ashamed of amassing huge quantities of material things, a mindset that differentiates us from much of the rest of the world. The consequence of that problem is that you are driven by greed, and have a strong desire and obsessed with money.   Why are in the world are so many people adamant about their kids majoring in Bio, Comp Sci? Because being experts in those fields could help you make this world a better place? In theory, yes we have some of the most brilliant software entrepreneurs in the entire world that we could disrupt health care, education, and truly make a difference in this world. But oh no, screw that, what about MONEY? How much money could I earn though? Thats the driving factor right?. Yesterday, I was sitting down at Subway, and working on some my school work,  I over heard a parent telling their kid  whom I think is a high school senior to major in comp sci, and brought up 100k starting salaries. Why the hell would u bring up salaries when your kid is a high school senior? , do you want that to be a driving factor, oh right we as a society are shamelessly driven by our greed and lust for money right. And its our duty to shove that down our children's throats too right  Maybe I am just envious, maybe not, i dont know, but what I do know is its very tempting to really want to make a lot of money right now. I am now barely surviving month to month, after paying my rent and am getting financial aid  to pay for tuition. As I am a senior, I dont get get much financial aid as I used to get, thus I didnt have enough money left over to buy books for this quarter. Food is a struggle, I freaking love to eat fish, chicken, but meat is expensive to buy. I just eat pasta, ramen, pbjelly sandwiches, and grilled cheese sandwiches. What hurts me the most is when I Skype with my parents every weekend , and when they ask me what am I having for dinner, I lie to them and tell them that I am having chicken and rice, and that whats hurts me the most that I have to lie to them. So, for someone like me who goes to Subway and asks for croutons packets as they give those for free and has like 2 or 3 packets for dinner and nothing else, pretty hard to convince me to major in liberal arts as much I would love to. But one thing is for sure, I'm not sure for how long I can keep eating packets of croutons or a banana for dinner and go to sleep because I had already used my 5 dollars per day quota for food. Anyway, really sorry for the random venting, and its irrelevant to this post. One more thing, for kids who have parents paying tuition and living expenses for you, good for u, you got lucky that you won the genetic lottery, I wish I had someone who would pay my tuition, but its all good, thats not the way the world works right. And lastly, If i ever had the chance to write a letter to 17/18 year old me, I would not tell myself to major in bio or compsci or  any liberal arts, and I would also not say what to major in, it does not matter, just do whatever the fuck you want to do. nobody cares. nobody fucking cares."

ABCDesis,339vb1,ravibkjoshi,3,Mon Apr 20 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"Going to give my input as a (possibly naive) high school senior who's thought a lot about this...I agree with Zakaria's take on it though, just not a lot of editorials on the topic.   I used to think a pure liberal arts education was awesome. Learning how to think, how to communicate, how to analyze different techniques used in paintings from 18th century Spain (that was a bit feisty, sorry). But I've slowly realized that it is a similar case as in Punjab, where liberal arts is what the kids use as an excuse to check out college girls and get into fights on campus. That is to say, I see a lot of people deferring to the humanities because frankly it's a lot easier and they need to justify that college education in some way. I say this as someone who ardently loves the humanities, maybe even more than the sciences.   Does that mean that everyone who pursues the humanities are just lazy people who couldn't make it to science? Absolutely not. One of my good friends is in academia, and it really does seem like there's significant thought and work that goes into his career-path and education. But that's the key; there's significant thought and work. There are those who actually love the humanities, who are willing to stay up late nights, go through extra schooling, and take stress (shocker) for studying the human experience. To say that this is the majority of liberal arts majors is a bold statement.  When I see absolutely brilliant scientists like Richard Dawkins saying absolutely cringeworthy and elementary interpretations of history and philosophy, it saddens me a good bit, it does. I think learning about the liberal arts is crucial, the pursuit of knowledge itself. But what makes this relegated to a college classroom? Want philosophy, pick up Kant or Bertrand Russell yourself. Read academia on your own time, historical books for fun. You don't need a teacher so much as a class. I absolutely think that liberal arts are necessary in the modern world, but perhaps the way we disseminate information via the undergraduate college classroom needs to be rethought for those who are going to use it in their broad life and not to pursue further education on the topic."

ABCDesis,33aevm,trctn4238934,0,Tue Apr 21 08:31:19 2015 UTC,I was born in India and strongly identify as an India.

ABCDesis,33aevm,TaazaPlaza,6,Tue Apr 21 20:15:19 2015 UTC,+1. I hate that having an Indian passport restricts free travel so much. I don't need it to prove my origin either. There is no benefit of having an Indian passport at all.

Jokes aside, I think we need to answer several serious questions before allowing dual citizenship. For example would you allow dual citizens to be elected for public office or work in sensitive roles etc. We also have issues with some of our neighbors so we will mostly likely allow this with only a few countries if and when this happens."

ABCDesis,33aevm,badmintonnewbie,3,Tue Apr 21 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"I get this is going to be a touchy question for a lot of people, but I'm curious about this and am genuinely asking. Why are people so hesitant about giving up their citizenship if they have zero intentions of ever moving back to the home country? You citizenship doesn't define your identity. I've always found it extremely baffling when people will move to a new country, settle there, raise a family there, retire there, buuuuut god forbid they become a citizen. ""why should I? I am Indian/Pakistani/etc.."" Are you really though? At this point you have lived longer in another country then your home country. Why does switching citizenship suddenly change your identity?"
ABCDesis,33aevm,immilaw,3,Tue Apr 21 00:36:46 2015 UTC,"I think for a lot of people, it's about the difference between owning your home and renting one. You can rent a decent place for a long time and possibly get a better bargain than home ownership, but it's an emotional issue because you feel that as long as you own a house, you can never be destitute. This may not be technically true because renters have certain rights against sudden eviction and your house can be taken over by the bank or declared unfit to live by the city, but there's a feeling of safety when you own your house.  The citizenship of your birth country is similar in that way. Technically, you can be assaulted by the government and be put in jail without a fair trial but you feel like you belong to that land and nobody has the moral authority to question your existence. When you are in a country that you were not born in, you might have a niggling sense that you don't belong, despite citizenship."

ABCDesis,33aevm,immilaw,2,Tue Apr 21 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they don't. My parents naturalized me when I was 17 and then when I had to apply for a visa to go to India a couple years back they wanted me to mail back my old passport and sign something officially renouncing citizenship (which seems like ominous overkill since I figured I renounced the Indian citizenship when I took the American one.)"
ABCDesis,33aevm,recycledpaper,3,Wed Apr 22 12:48:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have to pay a fee to renounce your Indian passport (if you've held one prior to naturalizing), and that's a prerequisite for getting an Indian visitor/tourist Visa."
ABCDesis,33aevm,immilaw,2,Tue Apr 21 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"It sucks and many people have been trying to get them to do the whole duel citizenship thing but, they won't :("

I would love to have a full Indian passport for sure!"
ABCDesis,33aevm,selene623,5,Tue Apr 21 00:14:35 2015 UTC,The OCI card basically says that you have the same rights/privileges as an Indian passport holder. So I have no idea why people find it a nuisance. It looks nearly the same as a passport!

ABCDesis,339p3z,samisosa420,6,Mon Apr 20 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"I spent the first ten years of my life in the Middle East and then my family moved to the States. We moved 3 times when we were in the ME and changed schools just as many times so I never knew the same group of people for more than a couple of years at best. I don't really remember having a proper idea of friendship in those years.  Then after moving to the states my family moved around a lot for the first year but then eventually settled in the same city for about 6 years but we moved houses 3 times during those years. I stayed in the same school though so it didn't feel as much like moving.  Then we moved to a completely different place in the middle of high school. Then I went to college in a completely different location. And now I'm in grad school on the other end of the country.  So I've moved around many times, formed and lost friends several times, and grappled with the clash of cultures on many different levels. The main thing that's different about me is that I am really wary of forming friendships and relationships. It takes a lot for me to call someone a friend. But at the same time, once I get there with someone, I never let go.  As for loneliness, it's a weird thing. Conventionally, not having friends and lasting friendships makes you a loner. But because I moved so much I never had much of a desire to integrate. It sounds bad to say that I was a loner up until college but the fact is that it never bothered me. I never had a sense of wanting to be a part of something. I was most comfortable alone, so I didn't have to really deal with it.  The best part is that I find that I can relate to all kinds of people. It's easy for me to transcend cultural/ethnic boundaries because while I didn't have a lot of friends, I still interacted with everyone and never developed a sense of really distinguishing between people. I was often different so I never saw other people as different.  The cultural experiences of living in very different places has also given me a lot of insight. Not to mention all the usual immigrant struggles as well."

My parents are relocating to yet another country this year and I will be moving back to the US.   Two big things I learned: not everyone is like me, nor will they like me, but i should learn as much as I can from thek anyway. And accumulating memories with people at places you enjoy being at is more valuable and easier to transport than accumulating stuff. I'm no minimalist but i can't imagine owning more than a certain number of possessions because it's just such a hassle to move everything.  I was always lonely as a child. I was extremely shy but i desperately wanted to get to know everyone i met. I managed to overcome this a few years ago but before that, books were my best friends. I never played any team sports in school either. Moving a lot made this more difficult but i doubt it would've been much different."

Usually in Indian movies it's guy and girl fall in love, fight both parents, villains and in the end get married. Here, guy and girl get together, both don't want to get married because their ambitions will make it hard to pursue a relationship (something a lot of us can relate to), so decide to pursue a very casual relationship.  I also think the movie portrayed the yuppie urban Indian crowd pretty accurately."

Then write more because your first ones are going to suck. Check /r/screenwriting for more tips.  After that you can start thinking about getting something made.

There are a lot of Indians who come to the technical universities for a PhD or even MSc in some cases. I'm from the West and there are a lot of Surinamese of Indian origins. There are very few actual desis here who like in the USA or UK have put down roots. Most are expats. It's a complicated situation.  That said, I've hardly faced any open racism.

Basically if a pet was running throughout the home, for example if the dog sat on the sofa she'd consider it highly unsanitary for us to be sitting there too. Same with a pet's feeding dish being put in the same dishwasher as our own crockery, also things like potential smells and fur shedding rendered her smiles to suddenly disappear.

ABCDesis,333llj,in_the_airoplane,9,Mon Apr 20 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of us in college feel like we have to have things figured out regarding our career and life direction. The fact is, it's okay if we don't. It's not too late for you to pursue all of those things that are a better fit for your interests and passions. Going to college and specializing in the fields of your interests doesn't guarantee instant success right after graduation, either.   Desi parent guilt is a real thing, and overcoming it is incredibly difficult. But--you're officially an adult, which means you're in the great, unique position to now let that shit go. Stand up for yourself and what you want to achieve. It might be hard, but you're otherwise  going to spend the rest of your life using them as a cop-out for why you didn't live the life you want. Taking accountability for your career choice is scary because it means only you are responsible for the outcome. Before, you could deflect shortcomings by saying, ""my parents held me back for so many years,"" but when you let that go, the onus falls squarely on you.  I know this may not be the welcomed advice or sympathetic ear you're probably seeking. But the ""opportunity to discover what you truly want to do in life"" is not gone, nor is it something your parents can take from you. It's still there, and if you're willing to take responsibility for pursuing it, it's yours for the taking.  Good luck."
ABCDesis,333llj,RotiRoll,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was anticipating a response like this, actually. From what I have observed, some ABCDs are just more courageous and confident than others. For example, all those Indian-American comedians and actors/actresses possibly defied their parents at some point. I never felt like I could do that (I've never even dated and I'm 20!). I never had the courage to face my parents and tell them, ""No, I want to do this"" or even go behind their backs to pursue my interests. That's not on my parents. That's on me. I fully understand that, but if I got any kind of support for them, I would have felt more secure if I did decide to change my career path. I know that I need to change this about myself if I want to pursue something that I'll feel happy and fulfilled doing. It is definitely a priority."
ABCDesis,333llj,GodModeONE,6,Sun Apr 19 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: My parents always wanted me to be a doctor. I'm now in my third-year of college and realize that I should have taken a career path that better matched my personality and natural talent.   As to your thread title: You're ONLY what, 21/20?   Honestly, if you've decided you don't want to be a doctor, this is a good time to get off that train. I'm not sure what other jobs there are for a biology major.  (I honestly would just complete the major and get out because incomplete things look the worst to other people and you said you still find the classes interesting, YMMV.) I'd see what you can do with the major, and I'd ask people who have biology majors but ended up writing how they got there, and what their lifestyle is like, etc.  Ask for alum referrals. Ask around on this reddit and others --if you haven't already. If you have a plan and you're in the middle of it, I think your parents will worry far less. You should be planning anyways, because even if you stay on the med school train, there's a possibility you might not get in the first time anyways.

This was the kick in the pants that I needed to tell my parents I wasn't going to be a doctor and they needed to accept that. I spent some time repairing my GPA in community college and this week I was accepted to a different university starting this fall as a computer science major. It's worth noting that since deciding to switch to CS, I've gone from being a C student to maintaining straight A's for 5 straight semesters, which shows that when you're passionate about something, that translates to a better work ethic and desire to immerse yourself in whatever you're doing, which is pretty important for something you're going to be doing for the rest of your life.  While I wouldn't recommend flunking out of college as the best way of finding one's true path in life, overall I'm in a better place now that I don't have the prospect of a career I have no interest in looming over my head.   You need to remember that at the end of the day, it's your life, not your parents'. You have to be happy with the decisions you make for yourself and the future you want to have.

After you graduate (and as a dropout I highly recommend you graduate) you can learn to program -- either on your own, from a community college, or from a number of intensive coding bootcamps that are springing up all over the country. I'm enrolled in Dev Bootcamp right now and it feels like place I've always been searching for.

ABCDesis,333llj,i_am_not_sam,2,Sun Apr 19 19:47:13 2015 UTC,I think App Academy in SF is the big one that only charges tuition once you've found a job.  In a similar vein but slightly different is Hungry Academy which is run by the website Livingsocial.com . I believe it's completely tuition-free and provides housing. You basically live with everyone else in the program and afterwards you get a job at Livingsocial.  There's also a program specifically for women but I've forgotten what it's called. A bunch of programs (including Dev Bootcamp) provide lower tuition for women.

And it's a job that's very location dependent. My skillset requires me to stay in Silicon Valley (and parts of Texas) for a job. Otoh, if you're a doctor you can move anywhere in the country to be with your family, friends, or significant other.  But try doing some coding as a side hobby if you're interested. You'll get a better idea if that's your thing."
ABCDesis,333llj,arsy-varsy,3,Mon Apr 20 03:19:18 2015 UTC,I'm a software engineer too and I don't buy this at all. I don't live in the Silicon Valley and never will. Every state has a technology hub and you haven't looked well enough if you think software is limited to silicon Valley or Texas. And really if you think practicing medicine anywhere is easier than finding software jobs you really don't understand either profession.   Edit : and the work culture you're complaining about is also very company specific in Silicon Valley. Lots of companies aren't like that and in other states software engineering is among the highest low effort to high pay professions around.
ABCDesis,333llj,shallowpuddles2,3,Mon Apr 20 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  My husband is a developer and I envy his lifestyle.  He works 30-35 hrs a week, going in at 10-11 am, takes 2 hr lunches,  and generally has a great work-life balance.  He gets paid well too.  He is is very very good at his job though. There are a lot of people in his company (sadly mostly desis and asians) who work till 8 or 9 pm struggling to meet deadlines.  Most of these people complain to my husband that they were forced into CS by their parents.  If you neither have the interest nor the aptitude for coding, software is a bad career choice. However, this holds true for any career choice - if you are not passionate about it, you are going to miserable and probably suck at your job. I am not implying that OP is bad at his/her job, but it really baffles me when people complain about being overworked in CS.

If not, hell no stay in the U.S."
ABCDesis,3320f9,darthrevan,10,Sat Apr 18 22:31:10 2015 UTC,"This is probably a controversial view, but even with a lot of money, the best lifestyle one can enjoy in India is equivalent to a middle-class existence in the US.   For instance, it's hard to find good ethnic food (American, Vietnamese, Thai, Mediterranean, Italian, etc) in India, and when you do find it, it's in the hotels so it costs a lot of money and there's not much choice. In the US, there's an abundance of choice in these options for a fraction of the cost.   You can have a fancy car in India... but you're driving along pot-holed ridden roads. It's a more enjoyable experience driving a beater of a car along nice roads in the US with much better, less polluted traffic.   Being rich in India equates to a nice, large house with quality finishes... but this is also possible for much less in the US thanks to the abundance of land in most cities, coupled with a Home Depot providing tons of great finishes for low cost.   Hiring a cook is a plus of having money in India... but it's not hard to pick up a huge array of delicious ready-made meal options in US grocery stores. These just aren't available in India.   The quality of US infrastructure means even those who live in middle-class homes can enjoy cleaner neighborhoods--a feature that's incredibly difficult to find in the poshest of India's districts. Being rich in India also doesn't shield one from the country's incredible poverty, sanitation problems, etc.  In my experience, having a lot of money has made India a manageable place to live."
ABCDesis,3320f9,in_the_airoplane,3,Sun Apr 19 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"Middle class life in the US is certainly better than upper middle class or may be moderately well off life in India. But if you are one of the rarer people who are genuinely rich then life in India can be pretty good. You still cannot escape the traffic and the noise but other than that you can have pretty much everything else. The biggest benefit is how easy it is to employ a large workforce.  For example if you are rich guy you can Hire a cook or two to prepare whatever you want at home. If he cannot cook something exotic you can ask your driver to get it from the nearest five star hotel(assuming you live in one of the large citites). You can get driven everywhere. You don't have to be a Bill Gates to be able to afford a round the clock driver. You can employ maids to clean your home, do your laundry, take your dog for a walk, do your grocery shopping etc. You can have the barber come to your home every time you feel like having a hair cut."
ABCDesis,3320f9,trctn4238934,3,Sun Apr 19 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"I have all of the above.  I love my cook and the beautiful Indian food she makes, but I'd rather go to a US store and pick up reasonably priced ready made Western food. Even when I order from the hotels, I have a hard time justifying the price when its total is 10 days' worth of my cook's wages (it's psychologically hard to be an extravagant spender here when so many people have so little). Maybe this sounds snobbish, but I have yet to be impressed by the caliber of non-Indian hotel food--it's alright, but nothing spectacular. Plus, I have to wait for over an hour for the food to be delivered because traffic sucks.  I get driven where I need to go, but I have to sit in horrendous traffic, where the incessant honking and bumps create stress even sitting in the back. I'd rather drive myself on the open, sane roads of the US. I welcome it every time I return for Thanksgiving and Christmas, actually.  My maid is great, but I wish I didn't need one on account of the dust and grime from the gas kitchen. Here, the paint fades faster, the walls leak sooner, the fixtures rust or break down more easily. It was simpler keeping my US house cleaner than it is my Indian one. Plus, the abundance of hyper-specific cleaning supplies in the States makes it easy to clean things myself; my maid's standards are much lower and she has fewer tools to do a better job.   People coming to our house for services is pretty awesome."

Hitler, like Neopold, viewed himself as superior to conquered states, and slaughtered civilians in areas that he conquered. It's also relatively forgotten that he murdered the sickly and elderly in his rampage across the Soviet Union. What he's remembered for historically is intentionally picking Jews out of their homes, putting them in specific camps, and specifically exterminating them for their inferiority as a race. The blacks killed in the Congo were dehumanized, probably for racial reasons, but it's not really the same thing unless you believe in utilitarian morality where it's the number of deaths that matter more than intent. The same goes for the Bengal Famine, it's not actually as cut out as an intentional genocide as OP's link makes it out to be (all his sources are not historians but journalists), as Britain was war strained and even they couldn't feed their whole populace. Churchill detested Indians, but he was also one of the few who called the Jallianwala Bagh ""abominable"" and a ""disgrace on the Empire,"" so saying that he would have done the same on a larger scale is a bit disingenuous, I would think.   By that same token, that's why there's a difference between racial American slavery and say, the slavery that Arabs and the Roman Empire participated in. But in that case, it's the conservatives/Euro-centrics stating that ""slavery is slavery, no matter what the intent was"""
ABCDesis,32z807,asdfioho,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"My main issue isn't to draw parallels between Hitler and Leopold/Churchill. Its obvious the policies and ideologies that lead to the deaths of millions of people differed between these men, but my issue is on their legacy.   No one knows about Leopold II, people hero-worship Churchill and American politicians continue to quote him and praise him as a great leader and he's held in high esteem in the UK. There is little to no mention in history books of the absolute evils of Imperialism. This is a point that I think is absolutely relative to the world we live in today. Imperialism didn't happen hundreds of years ago, people didn't die en masse thousands of years ago, many of these events took place within a 100 year span.  Pearl Harbor and World War II lives on in the psyche of many Americans and Europeans to the point that many people talk about how their grandparents and great grandparents experienced these events, but our grandparents suffered with them and more under the hands of Imperialism. This continues in the psyche of many more people around the world and when Imperialism is mentioned by someone from Africa and Asia, we're usually met with someone rolling their eyes and going ""Not this again, why am I held responsible for this?! I wasn't around when this happened!""  Sure, but our lives are affected by the past all the time, our life story doesn't begin when we're born, its part of a larger story and it actively affects us as we're raised by the people who have lived through the history that shaped them and it shapes us. Many of our grandparents were alive when the Bengal Famine took place. There is less than 2 generations separating us from the Congolese genocide.   I want people in the West to acknowledge their recent Imperialist past, just as the German people acknowledge their Nazi past and the affect it has had on this world. Instead, we have people whose knowledge of Imperialism is centered around the wars fought between various super powers to carve out the planet among themselves, and how these ""colonies"" were a source of raw material. That is it."
ABCDesis,32z807,RotiRoll,3,Sat Apr 18 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that there never seems to be any mention the coincidence that right before the famine, Bengal was in the grips of a mass insurrection against British rule, which was part of the wider Quit India Movement that saw the British lose control over large parts of the country.  In Midnapur, Bengal, British authorities completely lost control to councils of workers and peasants who established indigenous parallel governments.    I don't know why historical analysis of the 1943 Bengal famine never mention the political upheavals in the area that preceded and lasted through the famine.  It seems like a very, very significant detail in terms of potential motives for why the British cut off supplies and exacerbated famine in the region--similar to Stalin's motives toward starving Ukraine in the '30s in the wake of anti-USSR unrest."

Sadly enough, the only person who defended Churchill was a fellow Indian American.

Its like having Jews defend Hitler and praising him for being a profound leader and pulling Germany out of the depression."
ABCDesis,32z807,BenjaminSatanyahu,3,Sat Apr 18 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"I also don't like Churchill, but I really think the link posted was biased. All the ""sources"" were journalists, one with a specifically Marxist slant. There's no rigorous historical analysis at all, and a whole lot of emotional projection. If he was really India's Hitler, why was it Churchill who stood up against Jallianwala Bagh massacre and condemned it as abominable?  Were the British racist, dehumanized colonial people's, and thus didn't consider their food needs in comparison to their own? Absolutely. Did they willingly commit genocide in Bengal just cuz? The history is really tenuous to support that POV.  There are British/colonial apologists who twist history for their use, and there are Indian nationalists who do the same. Our concern should be with the historical truth, not what narrative pushes our agenda. I used to believe Churchill was just a genocidal maniac who history forgot, but there's just too much evidence to the contra to neatly make such a claim."
ABCDesis,32z807,Molozonide,3,Sat Apr 18 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"*why was it Churchill who stood up against Jallianwala Bagh massacre and condemned it as abominable? See, I'm not certain it was because he suffered heart pangs. I think it offended his sense of ""Oh we are civilized rulers who are honorable"" and the massacre itself is  blatant with actual blood and one person to point to for the orders. Diverting food shipments is a paper movement, operates in slow motion, and is bloodless, *and is harder to mobilize outrage against.   Did they willingly commit genocide in Bengal just cuz?   I don't know. Firstly you don't need to round up people into concentration camps and have some frothing speeches raving about racial superiority to commit genocide.  Secondly, if they did, it's not as if having reasons makes it better. It certainly served their purposes to have so many people die. Less Bengalis, less rebels, easier to control. Remember the British were always outnumbered, and were holding on to their empire by their fingernails at the time. If so, it certainly helps inform Subash Chandra Bose's ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" mentality when talking to Axis powers."

ABCDesis,32xo76,wizarrd,8,Fri Apr 17 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"For perspective, a lot of the usual choral repertoire is in Latin and German, and choristers maul those languages beyond recognition. (Not to mention that Latin is dead, and even scholars can't figure out what the ""right"" pronunciation is.) We even have a ""choral form"" of various European languages where we purposely mess up the pronunciation to ""get better resonance."" Native German, Italian and French speakers laugh their butts off when they hear American choirs, even professional ones.  We would hardly call this a desecration of these languages and cultures. Arguably, that we include various non-English European works in the repertoire, is a testament to how mainstream they are, and how much they contribute to modern thought.  That they're including this Indian song means that it, too, is becoming mainstream and getting integrated into the standard repertoire. This is a good thing! People who struggle with the language are attempting it anyway! They're absorbing our thought and culture, even if the words come out a little funny sounding.  This is the fundamental tradeoff you make when you share your culture. There's no reason for shame, any more than someone German should feel when they hear Bach from American musicians. You should be proud, and your family should be proud! This is not mauling your tradition, it's a celebration of who you and your ancestors are."
ABCDesis,32xo76,RotiRoll,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Even if the language is a bit off, people are still going to love it -- Indians and Caucasians alike. It's not the end of the world, either way.  But it bothers me, you know? And I think it should, too. Even if other people think it sounds good, I know how it actually sounds. And I'd like to live up to that sound.  I see where you're coming from with the ""fundamental tradeoff"": culture does get diluted when others pick up on it. And it's bound to happen. But sometimes, in the best case scenarios, we get something that honors tradition and celebrates a new acceptance of the world around it. And that's what I want to see my choir do."
ABCDesis,32xo76,RotiRoll,2,Mon Apr 20 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"But it bothers me, you know? And I think it should, too. Even if other people think it sounds good, I know how it actually sounds. And I'd like to live up to that sound.   I totally understand that it bothers you. It would bother me too.  Where I'm getting at is that choral works in foreign languages always sound off. And given that this happens with the best musicians, you want to make sure that you haven't set yourself an unreasonable task.  This is one song, in a completely unfamiliar language. I really doubt they will reach a level where they ""make your parents proud."" I've studied French, and sung in French for a long time and my friend still (jokingly) accuses me of ""raping the French language.""   we get something that honors tradition and celebrates a new acceptance of the world around it   It's important that you also honor their efforts, and set a reasonable bar, otherwise you're just going to put people off South Asian culture. You can't expect they will develop native-level pronunciation in a month.  If you want perfect pronunciation and authentic sound, there's plenty of desi musicians, who have years of training and spoke the language from birth, to communicate that. If someone started a desi choir I'd join the shit out of it. (Though, desis, too, have internal barriers. It's hard for me to say phrases in Hindi without a Bengali accent. It's non-trivial to switch between Hindustani, Carnatic, and more modern styles, because they all have complicated and different vocal technique. I've been told my western vocal training affects my Bengali singing, even though I try to not mix techniques.)  Are they vaguely understandable? Are they doing as well in Hindi(?) as you did for your first German or French (both are hard for beginners) song? Would you be able to do as well in a desi language that you don't know? Then it's fine.  EDIT: Yay grammar."
ABCDesis,32xo76,badmintonnewbie,2,Mon Apr 20 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Maybe I'm not making myself clear. One of the other people in the choir said that they're going to love us no matter what; it's more about paying tribute, and getting as close as we can. Currently, the choir sounds alright to most people, but it's really easy to improve some basic things. I'd love if they could sound authentic, and I'll work towards that, but in any reasonable sense, we're not going to get there. And that's fine."
ABCDesis,32xo76,RotiRoll,7,Mon Apr 20 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"OT, but this reminds me of a Carnatic song one of my teachers taught me that was in a big band style, and the musical idioms...did not mix well.  My choir training and my Carnatic vocal training, such as it was, had very different mouth placements as well as the use of my head voice. No advice, just commiserating."

ABCDesis,32xo76,pakiinbetweener,2,Fri Apr 17 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"I spent much more time learning the correct pronunciation of words and meaning than the actual tune. Of course it's easier for me to hear the sounds than someone who isn't around Indian language speakers, but still.  In addition, western choral singers end up pronouncing English far differently than they would speak it. The technique tends to deemphasize consonants as much as possible, only saying enough so it's not all vowels. Choral and operatic English tends to incomprehensible to my parents and they're  fully bilingual at least.  I also think there's less leeway to mutate a word in song in many Indian languages before it becomes something else."
ABCDesis,32xo76,Molozonide,6,Sat Apr 18 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"It's great that you are trying to teach your choir the right way to sing this. Honestly, as long as they have a recording of this song and are a good choir, they shouldn't be mispronouncing the words. Bengali singers with horrible spoken Hindi accents sing perfect Bollywood songs all the time. I don't know any Japanese (beyond a few weeks of spoken Japanese that I have since forgotten) but I can sing numbers from Studio Ghibli movies that I've heard over and over on my music player.  If your choir members are serious about this and the technicalities of the music (pitch, chord etc.) aren't outside their range, they should be able to sing without problem. Just my two cents."

If you don't do the r/l sound correctly a native speaker would still notice. Besides that, citing Japanese is almost cheating because it is a very easy language for English speakers to pronounce.

ABCDesis,32xo76,bug-bear,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you think Japanese is easy for English speakers to pronounce. Japanese pronunciation is closer to Hindi, if anything, and most English speakers can't even pronounce Spanish or Italian well. I have friends who were fans of Korean dramas and movies and they can sing Korean songs the same way I can do with a few Japanese ones that I've heard repeatedly.  There will obviously be some possible problems but what I meant to say was that singing is a completely different ballgame from speaking. You can be horrible at pronouncing a language while speaking while be comfortable with pronouncing words in singing. Look at Bollywood-inspired youtube videos of foreigners trying to sing Hindi songs while not knowing the actual language. Heck, I used to mangle Telugu pronunciation when I tried to speak a bit but I could still sing Telugu songs at competition level."

ABCDesis,32tl64,sampak,3,Thu Apr 16 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"While it's not obvious that the sex of the child was key in this case, saying sex selection doesn't exist in Asian communities does little to advance the rights of women.  It's definitely happening, statistically, in many Asian immigrant communities, including the desi community. While the female-male sex-ratio for a firstborn child is the naturally occurring one, 1:1.05, if the firstborn is female, the ratio becomes 1:1.2ish, and if the first two children are female, the ratio becomes 1:1.5ish.  The ratios do not go the other way if the first born children are boys. These patterns do not exist in other ethnic groups, nor is there any biological explanation. It does appear that parents in these groups try to ensure they have at least one son, and perceive multiple daughters to be an undesirable outcome.  Banning abortion and reproductive choice isn't a good solution to ending sex selection. There's lots of other, factual, reasons to support reproductive rights.  But let's not pretend sex selection doesn't exist, or that statistical trends and cultural reality are racist. I grew up in a typical family in my community where prejudice against daughters was (and to a large extent is) the norm. Girls and women regularly post here complaining about being criticized and shamed for being female. It's classic ""auntie culture"" thinking for the problem to be ""outsiders"" knowing about the bias, rather than doing something about the bias itself."

My family rarely, if ever, ate beef in India. We lived off of goats and chicken. Fish as well.   I'm not sure if I can go veg forever, but, I can go veg for a long time. I really love my goats. :3"

That's why the best strategy I've found is to take a sip and pretend I'm drunk. Ironically Sikhs are not supposed to drink either, and it's acccepted religiously, but many people elect not to follow it.   Do rural Pakistanis drink, incidentally?"
ABCDesis,32rlwz,asdfioho,2,Fri Apr 17 00:10:03 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm Punjabi and so are a lot of Pakistani people and I can certainly see that we have a bit of a macho culture and how drinking could be a big part of social settings.  I don't really know what the drinking situation is like in Pakistan. Pakistani families in the American diaspora generally do not drink and that's what I grew up around. The impression I get is that only the rich drink in Pakistan though I'm sure young men find ways to drink among themselves like anywhere else.
ABCDesis,32rlwz,pakiinbetweener,2,Fri Apr 17 00:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's interesting. I thought that most of the Pakistani diaspora would be either very religious rural or city.

We may all be Desi, but there are so many cultures, so many cuisine types, so many religions, so many languages- and I love learning about each and every one! This may be related to a sense of community, but that feeling that your desi pals have got your back if you ever need it.

ABCDesis,32pjbv,ifemze,15,Wed Apr 15 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Going to go out on a whim, as a proud Punjabi, and say that this is not a ""Desi"" problem in Canada. Just like the issue of sexual grooming in UK seems to be predominantly Pakistani immigrants (who happen to be demographically Muslim), the issue of gang and drug violence in Canada is predominant among Punjabi Jatts, who happen to be demographically Sikh. Every single Desi in that article fits that demographic.  Why? It has nothing to do with Sikhi, nor their political beliefs (generally anti-india), and although correlated with Punjabi culture, not caused by it. If is extremely shameful to us. If someone is interested in knowing my opinion on some of the social factors behind it, just let me know here and I guess I'll make a comment later when I get the time trying to explain what I think some of those are. I just made this comment in the interest of speaking frankly and providing additional context."
ABCDesis,32pjbv,asdfioho,19,Wed Apr 15 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I think the main factor here (again, my opinion) is the socioeconomics of Punjabi immigration to Canada. This problem of rampant gang violence is not really found in similar populations in UK or USA, so why here? During Bhangra competitions, we would always lament about the “Kaneda Munde,” (Canadian boys) who had a perception as rowdy and fierce.  Starting off, most Punjabi immigrants to Canada are uneducated laborers, or at least started off that way. Many of them came to make money, but a huuuuuge amount came after seeking political asylum in the turmoil in India during the 1980s and 1990s at the hands of the Indian government (which is why Khalistani activism is at its highest in Canada, incidentally).  I’ll give the example of my uncle; he got a law degree in India, moved to Brampton (for money), found out that it was worthless, and had to drive trucks to fund law school in Canada. This encompassed most of my cousin’s childhood. My uncle is actually pretty intelligent, but his son hasn’t done particularly well at school and is kind of estranged from his family as a result. This is partially because he didn’t have a childhood, what with his parents working the whole time. His father used to keep him in the seats of his trucks while he drove them as a substitute for a daycre  This is the situation in a ton of Punjabi families. I chuckle when I see all these posts about overbearing Desi parents who are crazy about their kids’ grades and all, considering a ton of Punjabi kids I know are completely detached from their parents. Most of these families are actually financially very, very well off, almost if not the same as your typical professional family. But in order to make that much money, they need to work a lot more, which takes up more time and takes away from spending with kids. In Punjab, even though the parents used to work, your grandparents in an extended family would take care of you. That model doesn’t really work in Canada, for a lot of glaring reasons, including the generational and cultural gap, the move from rural settings to urban/suburban, and the move to the nuclear family. An example of this lack of family “integration” is many Punjabi party settings, with boys seated in one corner playing video games, girls in another corner doing whatever, men sitting downstairs drinking and eating BBQ chicken, and the women sitting all together in another area.   So you have the very obvious fact that these kids don’t really have any type of relationship with their parents, and in a sense are raised in the “streets,” among other Canadian Punjabi kids. The next factor that doesn’t help is that Punjabi Sikhs in Canada ghettoize themselves. Although they buy nice houses and drive nice cars, they don’t technically live in nice areas: they group among other uneducated Punjabi immigrants. This leads to a lot of young men who roam together and try to find identity together.   When people complain about Desis having a “nerdy” image, as /u/awkwardquestionsbro points out, I always scratch my head. Hypermasculinity is a highlight of Punjabi culture; fighting, working out, “getting girls” (i.e. hookups), are all viewed as positives. Many Punjabis view white people as pussies (although part of their aversion to black people is this perception that black gangs and such outdo their masculinity and thus people fear them in a way) http://redkingsingh.tv This used to be a platform for showing Punjabi fights, although it seems like it has more varied material now. Of course, what used to be the case in Punjab was that you would get into fights at a young age, but would eventually wise up due to being around elders. Or like the case of my great grandfather, get your leg chopped off and learn a thing or two. But in Canada, with these street fights that can’t really escalate to that level, and when you have these kids completely isolated from elders, and who also as part of a diaspora romanticize Punjabi masculine culture and thus overdo it/exaggerate it as a result, you get these kids wasting their time after school getting into fights with the local gang. Of course, these groups also have alcohol, and eventually comes in the weed, and then many of them realize they can sell hard drugs to make money for their own once their parents cut them off or it’s not enough for their antics. And since their parents came in as laborers and many are not educated in the first place, these values don’t really pass on to the kids. I was with a ton of Canadian Punjabis and they couldn’t even speak English that well.   So in the end, I think the main cause is the socioeconomic situation of these Punjabis that migrate, and the ghettoization that occurs as a result of Canada’s “multicultural mosaic” model as opposed to integration. Punjabi culture in some way enhances this, since kids pick, choose, and then exaggerate parts of Punjabi culture to support their hyper-masculine identity-making on the streets. Nonetheless, there are unique aspects of [rural] Punjabi culture that some other Desis won’t quite understand that have the underpinnings that I mentioned. For example, other Desi groups may classify this as a case of parents getting involved and not wanting their kids to be indicted in the violence out of concern for their future, and thus sweeping it under the rug (which is what I guessed /u/ifemze was implying). In reality, it’s a bit more complex than that. How do I put it…in Punjabi culture, going to jail for a murder is not really considered that bad, based on the circumstances. Sexual crimes and thievery are heavily condemned (such that people often try to lynch sexual criminals), but murder “for the right reasons,” i.e., honor/protecting your clansmen/tribe is not considered bad at all. Going to jail for killing someone who you should have is considered less of a sin (especially as it is in non-Punjabi Desi culture, where it ruins family honor) and more of an inconvenience for a rightful deed. This is an old set of songs, straight from Punjab, conveying the life of the dacoit Jeona Morh. He killed the man (portrayed as a traitor) who got his brother, another dacoit, put in jail. Here’s a more modern song with a similar concept; jail for killing those who impeded on land is portrayed as a simple inconvenience for the noble husband-wife couple. In reality, this kind of culture had a place in ancient Punjab where the village+clan were your closeknit tribe, and you had to fight for your own land and life, but it’s fallen out of actual practice in Punjab. It’s remained in Canada due to the fact that these kids are living in a fake simulated world of sorts, with a mentality that hasn’t progressed for modern times or location, and trying to imbue their “gangsta Punjabi” ancestors in the streets. So when they mock the police and say “don’t worry about it,” it’s less of a “oh shit the police found out, let’s deny it all,” but more of a defiant, “yo, these police need to fuck out of our matters, we can handle ourselves and don’t need them snooping and interfering.”   I do want to clarify, that I am not saying that the majority of overall drug violence in Canada is at the hands of Punjabis, nor am I saying the majority of Punjabis are in this shit; it’s still a minority, just a relatively relevant one compared to other Desi populations."

If you want to build your own company eventually, what are you doing about it right now? i.e. are you working on meeting people, fleshing out ideas, and putting in the time? - I have a group of like minded friends I discuss ideas with but most times it goes nowhere. We all get busy in our day to day lives, that stuff falls through the crack. Did you know that there are free classes available online through  CourseEra, edX and the like that could teach you the basic principles of entrepreneurship? - Yes. I did couple of classes through coursera. Haven't tried entrepreneur one though. I'll give it a go.  Since you're in the midwest, have you looked at Northwestern and UMichigan's weekend MBA programs? - that's a pretty long commutes, even just for weekends, but I am thinking a little bit about it.  Have you considered moving to the East or West Coast for work so you can benefit from the better schools there? - Cost of living, especially with parents, make it tough to move there.    I'm not trying to dissuade you from going to school full-time by any means, but rather encouraging you to think about your alternatives. - I understand. And I do appreciate all your help. I'm as well looking for alternatives. So you guys are very helpful."

ABCDesis,32on14,steamywords,2,Wed Apr 15 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"I did my MBA. I'm going to try to explain the opportunity cost with regards to finances and time.   Accounting for the financial cost of attendance (tuition, fees, books, networking events - happy hours at least three times a week gets expensive and yes, they really should be attended, etc), cost of living (rent, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, price of suits, dry cleaning, etc) and other miscellaneous expenses that tend to pop up, your two years will be a money black hole. Assume about $75k-80k a year at a minimum in terms of expenses. On top of that, you probably will not have all that much time to work full time in any major capacity to bring money in.   Can you really go two years hemorrhaging time and money? I'm not using words like hemorrhage to scare you. I want you to understand what those two years will be like. Ask yourself if you are truly ready to make that resource investment now. If you're employed right now, can you afford to not have that income coming in for two years? What is the intrinsic value of that incoming cash flow for you?  I don't think you should ever give up on the hope of returning to school. You just need to make sure you're in the right stage of your life where you can go back."

If you think Africa never had a literary culture, then you might as well say that math and science only came to India after the arrival of the British.  Come on dude, just because you're ignorant of African history doesn't mean that it never happened.   The manuscripts of Timbuktu, the poets of the Ghanaian Empire, the literary traditions of the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) civilization, the libraries of Morocco, all of this never existed? Ancient Egypt, the Nubian Empire, etc. all had writing forms long before Europe developed theirs. The oldest alphabet and writing systems were developed in Africa.    There are numerous examples of pre-colonial Africa literature spanning the length and breadth of the continent, from scripts documenting the kings of Ethiopian and Ghanaian Ghanaian empires, as wells as popular folklore in a host of native languages, through to Mali’s famous manuscripts of Tumbuktu, dating from the 16th to the 18th centuries, with the wide array subject matter including astronomy, poetry, law, history, faith, politics, and philosophy among others.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_in_Africa#Pre-colonial_era   Examples of pre-colonial African literature are numerous. Oral literature of west Africa includes the ""Epic of Sundiata"" composed in medieval Mali, and the older ""Epic of Dinga"" from the old Ghana Empire. In Ethiopia, there is a substantial literature written in Ge'ez going back at least to the 4th century AD; the best-known work in this tradition is the Kebra Negast, or ""Book of Kings."" One popular form of traditional African folktale is the ""trickster"" story, where a small animal uses its wits to survive encounters with larger creatures. Examples of animal tricksters include Anansi, a spider in the folklore of the Ashanti people of Ghana; Ijàpá, a tortoise in Yoruba folklore of Nigeria; and Sungura, a hare found in central and East African folklore.[5] Other works in written form are abundant, namely in north Africa, the Sahel regions of west Africa and on the Swahili coast. From Timbuktu alone, there are an estimated 300,000 or more manuscripts tucked away in various libraries and private collections,[6] mostly written in Arabic but some in the native languages (namely Fula and Songhai).[7] Many were written at the famous University of Timbuktu. The material covers a wide array of topics, including Astronomy, Poetry, Law, History, Faith, Politics, and Philosophy among other subjects.[8] Swahili literature similarly, draws inspiration from Islamic teachings but developed under indigenous circumstances. One of the most renowned and earliest pieces of Swahili literature being Utendi wa Tambuka or ""The Story of Tambuka"".   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_literature#Precolonial_literature"

The younger generation in my family are allowed to date anyone (any other race/religion) as long as they aren't a Muslim, and it's not due to prejudice it's due to the conversion issue."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,Master_AK,-3,Wed Apr 15 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"Islam doesn't demand that non-Muslims must convert to marry Muslims, Muslims are the ones who make that demand in most cases.   Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted. There is no call for non-Muslims to convert to Islam in order to marry Muslims anywhere in the scriptures. Unless I'm mistaken, I'd like to see it if that's the case."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,tinkthank,2,Wed Apr 15 16:42:21 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it says in scripture that Muslim men can only marry people of the book (Christians/Jews) and women can only marry other Muslims. So conversion would be necessary for Sikhs/Hindus.  Did a quick google search and every site confirms this.
ABCDesis,32o6ht,Master_AK,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:54:11 2015 UTC,"You're right, but that's not a demand for non-Muslims to convert though for purposes of marriage. It states that a Muslim would have to marry a Muslim (i.e., someone who already follows the religion of Islam unless they're people of the Book), and in the past, Indian-Muslim scholars have expanded the term ""People of the book"" to Hindus and Sikhs as well, but it doesn't seem to be a very popular opinion.   The ones making the demand would be Muslims, since the same scriptures states that ""There is no compulsion in religion"" [2:256]. Any conversion that isn't sincere isn't accepted, but it's hard to measure sincerity for people, so the ""conversions"" are really done for purposes of the Muslim community itself and not for some spiritual reason(s).  The scriptures make no mention that ""in order for you to marry non-Muslims, they must convert"" or anything of its likeness, which is why I said the demand is by Muslims, not by the Qur'an [Islam]."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,tinkthank,2,Wed Apr 15 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"Okay maybe my choice of words wasn't the best. But a Muslim cannot marry a Hindu/Sikh without them converting first, that was my main point.  The fact that some extremely liberal Indian Muslims might think otherwise is quite a poor argument and is probably not taken seriously in the wider Muslim world."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,Master_AK,0,Wed Apr 15 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with your main point, but I guess my point is that this is an issue of contention in the Muslim community, at least in the South Asian Muslim community since it doesn't seem to ever be discussed in the wider Muslim community.   The fact that some extremely liberal Indian Muslims might think otherwise is quite a poor argument and is probably not taken seriously in the wider Muslim world.   This wasn't an argument made by ""extremely liberal Muslims"", but rather by conservative traditional scholarship and this has been a point of debate for centuries, not something that happened in recent times.   Islamic scholars differ on whether Hindus are People of the Book.[9] The Islamic conquest of India necessitated that the definition be revised, as most India's inhabitants were followers of the Indian religions. Many of the Muslim clergy of India considered Hindus as people of the book,[9] and from Muhhammad-bin-Kasim to Aurangzib, Muslim rulers were willing to consider Hindus as people of the book.[8] Many Muslims did not treat Hindus as pagans or idol-worshippers,[9] although Hinduism does not include Adam, Eve, nor the various prophets of Abrahamic religions. However, the present Muslim and South Asian worlds traditionally were quite close in culture and trade despite differences in religions since time immemorial, as evidenced by the development of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. It is worth mentioning that early Muslims who visited India believed they saw the worship of one true God behind the mask of several deities. However, with the 1947 partition of India, the now small minority of Hindus in Pakistan and to a lesser extent Bangladesh have been often persecuted as kuffar (see Anti-Hinduism in Pakistan, persecution of Hindus in Pakistan, in Bangladesh).   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book  The argument made by these scholars is that Hindus and Sikhs are monotheists in their core religious beliefs, hence why though they are polytheistic in practice, they are monotheists in belief. Now, as I've mentioned this isn't necessarily a widely held belief, but it is a point of contention among many different traditional Muslim scholars and theologians. This is an argument that is rejected by traditionalist literalists and those who believe that Hinduism, at least, shares similarities with the polytheists of pre-Islamic Arabia, for which this ""rule"" was initially revealed in the Quran.  Edit: I should also point out that some of these arguments were politically based as many Muslim rulers would marry Hindu princesses or have Muslim princesses marry Hindu rulers to form alliances. Many Muslim scholars began interpreting People of the Book to include Hindus which made it permissible for Muslims to marry their non-Muslim spouses and allow them to maintain and practice their religion freely."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,tinkthank,3,Wed Apr 15 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. I was never taught any of this (in Sunday school, etc). It was always Christians and Jews, no questions."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,bug-bear,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"That does seem to be the prevailing and most widely accepted belief among most Muslim scholars and Muslims in general. As it stands, a Muslim should marry a Christian or a Jew if ""they are righteous, pious, and affirm the Oneness of God""   Check out my edit, I had forgotten to add the political/historical backdrop to this argument."
ABCDesis,32o6ht,tinkthank,2,Wed Apr 15 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably an issue with semantics. Islam might not say literally that non-Muslims must convert to marry a Muslim, but it does say that Muslim men can only marry Muslim, Christian, and Jewish women, while Muslim women can only Muslim men, and in any other situation, the marriage is not valid and they would be committing the sin of fornication. So it's not a huge leap for parents to demand the conversion of someone before they marry their child.   I know that this isn't the case for everybody. Many of my friends are Ismaili Muslims, and while it's heavily preferred to marry other Ismaili Muslims, it's not uncommon for Ismailis of both sexes to marry Christians, Hindus, or Sikhs, and it's not considered as a sin for them, but I don't think this interpretation is common among other Muslims. Many of my Ismaili friends have told me that they've received flak from other sects from the way they interpret Islam."

ABCDesis,32o6ht,burgeoning_philosoph,2,Thu Apr 16 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"No, I probably wouldn't (I'm a Muslim). Mostly because my religion is important to me and it's something I need to work on throughout my life, and it's important to have a partner that can be complimentary in this regard. Also, avoiding family drama & etc.  That being said, I've had a lot of soft spots for Sikh women because many of them are so culturally/religiously tight yet socially progressive. Dare I say, a lot of my Sikh friends in general are better Muslims than some of my ummah (as in they embody Islamic principles well, and even honour & respect many Muslim saints/thinkers/etc)."

ABCDesis,32n3eu,_superliminal,3,Wed Apr 15 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's because many other temples in the ""chain"" have to sponsor parts of the temple. For example a new temple in New Jersey was built recently and the girls' section of my temple (the guys donated money too but separately, again with the whole separate thing) donated a couple thousand  ourselves for some random decoration part of the temple.  Edit: though they claim that if bapa wanted he could just magically make a lavish temple appear but he wants to give us a chance for sava"
ABCDesis,32n3eu,hahaheehaha,6,Wed Apr 15 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"When younger, about 9 or 10 I lived just a five minute walk away from the big mandir in London. They used to do these free Gujarati classes on Sunday so my parents sent my sister and me to learn.    What we only found out afterwards was that the majority of the time was to be spent learning about Shree Swaminarayan and his childhood and all these miracles that he performed. They would teach us all these stories and confiscated my Cheese and Onion crisps (still bitter about that).    In fact they refer to themselves here as the BAPS Hindu mission. I wouldn't go as far as calling them a cult however. As students we were given a chance to meet Pramukh Swami Maharaj and hear him talk. He spoke about many different forms of Hinduism and how the most important thing wasn't which God you held most dear.    They are definitely run like a business and I would call them quite fanatical about their religion but nothing more. I mean, the Mandir has these enormous Diwali and Holi celebrations which just aren't of prime importance for Swaminarayanism.    If I called anything a cult, it would be Hare Krishnas. There's a big Hare Krishna mandir in Watford, just outside London and they're very set in their ways in terms of their beliefs and closed off to any interesting discussion. Swaminarayans would regularly discuss issues such as morality and ethics with me.   Feel free to ask me more if you want."
ABCDesis,32n3eu,ShereOnFire,6,Wed Apr 15 10:19:37 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of the inner workings of the mandir because I am a religion teacher at one of them. The reason they hold these celebrations is so more people will come and they can tell them about swaminarayan. They will start out with stories about Ram or Krishna then slowly proceed to stories about swaminarayan, because they know the only way to get people to stay is by doing that."
ABCDesis,32n3eu,asdfioho,6,Wed Apr 15 10:55:30 2015 UTC,"I went to the one in Chicago. They made the men and women sit separately. When the arti came around they had a person carry it to all the men.

They have this tour inside where you watch a movie (really badly edited) and then they have a ride which show cases ""Hindu culture"" and at the end  they had all this propaganda showing why you shouldn't eat meat. You know what I did when I got home? I had chicken pizza.  I had an argument with a little sweet old lady (who spoke excellent English) she was saying that Swami Nayaran is actually God reincarnate and worshiping anyone else is wrong. We argued about him I claimed his miracles were false and even if they were true he must have had a huge ego to tell people to follow him and she's like he didn't. THEN WHY ARE YOU WORSHIPING HIM. Also she has to give a certain amount of her pay to the temple um Scientology much? At this time I realised I was acting like an arsehole I was literally trying to break the religious belief of a little old woman who was nothing but polite albeit misguided. Also she thought I was Sikh since I mentioned if Swami Naryan was performing miracles and could live the Himalayas as a child with little clothing, why couldn't he go to Punjab and help out persecuted Sikhs and Hindus.

Otherwise, you're just ruining these people's day.  Edit: And I agree with you a 100% on the persecution of Sikhs part.

Of course it's abused constantly, but I mean in its originally intended form.  I have a yoga teacher who says ""Yogis are anarchists.""  To me, she's absolutely right: no one is a spiritual authority over a yogi unless and until that yogi voluntarily chooses to serve a guru, and even then the purpose is to one day no longer need the authority.  The ancient yogis knew that once you organize around something, the chances for human mischief multiplies.  As I already mentioned, guru & disciples already presents its own challenges.  But masses of people?  Wealth?  Resources?  The temptations for abuse are infinitely higher, and the opportunities for evil people to exploit the innocent are many.  I don't know BAPS personally, so I'm not accusing them specifically of anything (though from others' posts here, the indications aren't good).  And perhaps there are good, honest Hindu organizations out there.  But for me, I'll take the guru out in the forest over the most popular, ornate temple anytime."

For example, they bring in craftsman from India, feed, clothe, pay for food, house them etc, just so they can craft the decorative edges on the rooftops. Seriously? Absurd waste of money. It's just like, ""Hurr-durr, look at me with my big ass temple, therefore I'm the best!""  Also how they've branded themselves.

The family lived in a compound maintained by the Chinese government for the sole purpose of housing diplomatic/foreigner staff. In the same neighborhood was a black Congolese family.  One day, my teenage mother accompanied the Congolese lady for grocery shopping outside. Within five minutes, a mob of young Chinese boys and girls had gathered around the African woman, and were rubbing their fingers all over her arms and then looking at their fingers, as if they expected some of the colour to come off.

The entire system is infected with corruption and obeisance to political interests, and so people have no faith in it. Conversely, there is a sense that outsourcing justice, e.g. with the Khobragade case, is a violation of Indian sovereignty. So on the one hand you have a very strong nationalistic sentiment that takes pride in its right to exist, and on the other you have a self-effacing doubt in the system's ability to dispense justice. The result is a fierce sense of entitlement to beat the shit out of perceived threats to civil society, both because nobody else will do it, and because it is ""our right"" to do it."

Our justice system sucks but I don't think that's what was at play in Khobragade's case. Indians were tired of what they see as US arrogance and took the opportunity to push back especially because most of us don't see what happened to the maid as a great injustice. You aren't a bad person in India just because you broke a law, you are a bad person depending on which law you broke.   In my experience mob violence in India happens when you want to teach someone a lesson, whether it's the thief who was caught or the lower caste person(or person of a different religion) who dared to behave like an equal. If you think of the black people as lower caste people it's easy to understand what happened in this case. I think our sucky justice system is one of the reasons why mob violence happens, because people aren't afraid that they will be prosecuted for it. Most people participating in attacks like this know that they are doing something illegal/wrong but do it anyway because they don't think they will face any significant consequences for it. (and yeah everything seems to suck a little more in Delhi).  And ""Bharat mata ki Jai"" isn't a ""Hindu"" nationalistic slogan. A Jain nationalist or an Atheist is as likely to use it as a Hindu one. Muslims are the only group that I know of who have an objection to it."

ABCDesis,32pvul,LotusEyes92,6,Thu Apr 16 00:31:22 2015 UTC,But Aishwarya Rai probably could be. What's your point? And don't tell me Aishwarya Rai is an exception and Karishma Kapoor somehow is your typical North Indian girl. She's not. They're BOTH exceptions. Most Indians regardless of where they're from don't look like that. There is a little bit of difference between your average North Indian and South Indian but even then there is so much over-lap that that difference becomes almost redundant.   Btw she's saying you can't get any because you're a dick. Get it?
ABCDesis,32pvul,immilaw,-9,Wed Apr 15 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"No she couldn't. Aishwarya Rai screams ""South Indian"" and is hideous in front of any North Indian upper caste woman.   Her features (bug eyes, flat nose, short face, weird jawline) skin color (dark olive) and hair all are Dravidian characteristics. Compare her to an average North Indian Upper Caste woman, and the differences are obvious:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/gurvinder_singh_hamza/4351721982/  Also, a comparison between South and North Indian women, the difference in race is obvious:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/gurvinder_singh_hamza/4352088294/  There is NO WAY I can ever feel chemistry with South Indians. Ever.  By the way, it seems you are misinformed about the anthropology of North Indian ethnic groups. While Rai might be rare in her pigmentation in South Indian Bunt communities, Karishma is actually closer to the norm in her pigmentation and facial features in North Indian Upper Caste communities. Want me to post pictures of my family to convince you? Better yet, go to Shaadi.com and search upper caste Hindus and Sikhs and see the differences in phenotype for yourself. Kapoor is typical for North Indians -- its just that blue eyes are atypical for any Caucasian group -- and upper caste Indians are no exception -- but for what its worth, I know PLENTY of blue eyed and fair skinned North Indian women. Another example: http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/Photo_gallery/6_072713111839.jpg  There is no fuckin overlap between North and South Indian women you dumbfuck. None at all. Yeah, there might be overlap between chamars and dalits who are North Indian and the other South Indians -- but otherwise -- the differences is as clear as night and day, both physically, genetically, forensically, and phenotypically. North Indian upper Castes are Caucasian. South Indians are Dravidians. Look at the aforementioned Flickr stream for more information. You are just an ABCD that has never been to India or North India and thinks all Indians are the same race, when all of science disagrees with you."

ABCDesis,32pvul,GWmyc2,7,Wed Apr 15 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"For some reason, I'm going to attempt to answer your question seriously. I'm going to ignore your ranting on the caste system and your relationship problems, and focus on the ""Indian Hemogeny"" question. Basically, if you live in an area with lots of Indians, then yes, people do segregate based on ethnic group and state of origin. I grew up in suburban Texas, you couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting two or three Indians. As a result, the Gujaratis hung out together, the Punjabis hung out together etc.  For college, I left Texas and went to Wisconsin. Wisconsin is not exactly a top destination for Indian immigrants. There just simply aren't enough Indians to divide up by ethnic group. As a result, Indians gather based on the shared identity of being Indian, because even if your born in the US, your up bringing is still infused to some extent (depending on your parents) with Indian culture. And while the details may be different depending on where exactly in India your from, there are overarching themes common to all of India. People join ISAs to meet and hang out with people who understand those broad over arching experiences, even if they don't understand the tiny details.  Edit: spelling"
ABCDesis,32pvul,bug-bear,4,Wed Apr 15 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"While it's technically true that India is a conglomerate of many former kingdoms with different cultures, religions, languages, etc., when you emigrate to a totally different country, you have more commonalities than differences with your fellow Desi.  It's also about building a community to help support one another and when you're a minority the more inclusive you are, the more people you will get.   Besides, most of these groups scream insecurity and an inability to assimilate into mainstream American culture.   Uh, or maybe it's about voluntarily wanting to engage with your heritage and culture? Or about eating delicious and tasty Indian food. Or both."

I strongly disagree with your premise about those groups screaming insecurity. I firmly believe those groups are a full representation of what it means to be American - a celebration of the ethnic diversity and a wanting to engage in cultural exchange with the rest of the community.

I have some cousins who didn't realize that their marriage happened for a visa, and it's going very badly. (Like you they were brought up very conservatively, and basically believed that the first person who said they were beautiful was their true love forever, etc. etc.)  Islam does allow the idea of marrying for convenience, and divorce. There's also no emphasis on the idea of romance. Similarly, Bangladeshis have married for status and wealth since time immemorial. :)   I probably wouldn't be able to deal with Schizophrenia though.   Not that I think you should marry someone with schizophrenia, but I do feel like people sometimes have the idea that it's much more severe than it is. There's idea of a schizophrenic version being a crazy, loud, madman. Yes, there are people like that, but mild schizophrenia (especially when medicated) are basically slightly odd-seeming people, but function, and non-violent.

This found tremendous traction in the social media and the desis who got involved were complimented in conference calls for their activism.   As far as CIR is concerned, several bills pop up but are ultimately killed because the fates of legal and illegal immigrants are tied together. I could be wrong but I've heard legal immigration reform has bipartisan support. It's not ideal, but I understand how challenging this problem is.

ABCDesis,32kt4f,arjun10,11,Tue Apr 14 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"I am an immigration attorney and I am also involved in lobbying to a minor extent (ish).  Unfortunately, legal immigration does not have bipartisan support at all! If anything, a certain political party is all about not letting foreigners take skilled jobs from Americans.  Our group really tried to get H1B reform passed - clear up the backlog, end country-specific priority date wait times, and figure out a way to deal with godamn H1B lottery (this year USCIS got 223k applications for 65k H1 spots).  Nope, no solution in sight."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,i_am_not_sam,4,Tue Apr 14 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"It is very telling that a lot of labor organizations try to simply block H1B immigration laws on the grounds of ""they are undercutting wages"", rather than try to incorporate H1B workers into unions or make sure they get paid wages that are on par with non-immigrant wages."

ABCDesis,32kt4f,x6tance,4,Wed Apr 15 02:37:37 2015 UTC,"It has to do with what the H1B visa is, which is supposed to be a ""temporary"" visa for foreign workers with specialized skills to ""fill in"" certain jobs until we find an American worker to do it. It supposedly follows that these workers should not be putting down roots here.  Of course that's not what the H1B visa practically is, which is an entry visa for specialized workers that aim to be permanent residents. It would be best to have a new category that reflects this purpose, and make laws about family and spouses accordingly. The majority of H1B people do more than just ""fill in"" - they contribute to their employers and their society - and their visa status should reflect that."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,immilaw,2,Wed Apr 15 05:42:05 2015 UTC,The number of H1Bs given out each year are limited by law. If you allow the spouses of all those H1Bs to work then theoretically you are allowing more people to work than the law intended to.
ABCDesis,32kt4f,trctn4238934,9,Wed Apr 15 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"Speaking of immigration, a question I've always liked to ask is: Why United States of America? Why not Canada, UK, or ANZ? I know plenty of Desi folks live there, but, illegal immigrants don't seem to be that high in those other countries, combined. Could be wrong though.   Is America that much more defining than other first world English speaking countries? I mean, I wouldn't have a problem if my family settled in Vancouver, instead."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,x6tance,5,Tue Apr 14 20:44:43 2015 UTC,Ha! This is exactly what I ask myself when I get these cases where people do anything possible to stay in the US.  Why here? Why not Canada or even Europe?
ABCDesis,32kt4f,trctn4238934,5,Tue Apr 14 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think legal immigration to Canada is easier (at least if you are a techie). Also US has more population than the the other countries you listed. So the number of illegal immigrants are also higher.  Personally I prefer the US to all the other countries you listed there except may be New Zealand. Canada is too cold, UK hates freedom(haha) and the rest of Europe doesn't speak English."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,harchickgirl1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"That's true. The mentioned countries combined equate to roughly below 40% of U.S population. But, I wonder if that means they have a combined illegal population that is also little below 40% of 450k or whatever the actual amount is.   Also, you forgot Australia in your list. Contemplating of throwing South Africa into the mix as well."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,x6tance,3,Tue Apr 14 21:25:51 2015 UTC,I have this impression that Australia is a little more racist than the US. Probably fueled by all the Indian bashing that happened there a couple of years ago(probably just media hype but I am not sure). Besides most of it is desert and the Indian community is probably not as large as in the US. But it is closer to India. So I am not sure.
ABCDesis,32kt4f,trctn4238934,5,Tue Apr 14 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"I grew up in America but live in Australia.  I'm not Desi; however,  I can categorically say that the US is far, far more racist than Australia.  I work in a hugely multicultural environment, and my Desi friends agree that all the Indian-bashing hype was just that:  hype.  Sure it happens.  But the Indian media pumped the first one up from a simple murder of an unfortunate random guy out walking in an unlit area late at night into a targeted murder of an Indian.  Australia's reputation went south after that.  Yes, micro-aggressions happen in both places.  But Australians are very much live-and-let-live types.  So even the racists usually keep their mouths shut.  Americans are more often my-way-is-best types.  Some get in your face about their beliefs.  So Australia is a far easier place to live for Desis.  Indians are 1% of the US population. Indians are 2% of the Australian population."

ABCDesis,32kt4f,militantbusiness,2,Wed Apr 15 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, NYC (JFK) to Mumbai (BOM) is slightly closer than Sydney (SYD) to Mumbai (BOM). Perth is the only big city in Australia that is legit closer to India. The others are very negligible.   Desis constitute huge chunk of population for a Western country. Other than weak internet, they seem to be faring well. What makes Australia popular is its living wage. You can work at McDonalds and earn decent money if you live with several people holed up. Save plenty easily.   Likewise, a big issue I think is blanketing all of America as one which is the farthest thing from the truth you can do. I'm willing to bet my state's crime is less than NSW...sans two cities, lol!"
ABCDesis,32kt4f,srs507,3,Tue Apr 14 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Canada is fine, other than the cold. The rest of these countries are less open to integration and more racist than the US from what I have heard."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,i_am_not_sam,6,Wed Apr 15 00:25:48 2015 UTC,I've had family members that are illegal and it's been interesting helping them get set up with life. The things we can do without an issue is a huge struggle for them. With the visa restrictions its tough for them to stay unless they launch a refugee claim.
ABCDesis,32kt4f,x6tance,0,Tue Apr 14 17:30:33 2015 UTC,My parents came here legally and followed the laws of the land. Why should illegal immigrants be allowed to stay? Deport them.

ABCDesis,32kt4f,immilaw,6,Tue Apr 14 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Laws are only tenuously connected with morality, ethics, and what is best rationally for society.

ABCDesis,32kt4f,immilaw,6,Tue Apr 14 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"(Personally, I don't think spending ~$4 billion to deport half a million Desis is a policy goal worth fighting for — but good people can disagree on politics.)  Roughly 1 in 7 of our community members are undocumented — but talking about undocumented Desis can seem as taboo as talking about LGBTQ Desis.  But we need to start sharing stories.  I think about a friend of mine who came to the U.S. as a child, growing up in an undocumented family.  Or the auntie in my community who escaped a complicated family situation.  Or the dad from Pakistan who came to the U.S. after his son (an international student) was hospitalized after an accident. He would spend every single day at his son's bedside, refusing to leave his son in a critical condition, even though he risked being put in immigration detention for overstaying his visa.  What are the stories of undocumented members of your Desi community?"
ABCDesis,32kt4f,recycledpaper,9,Tue Apr 14 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"I am an immigration attorney, and do I have stories! I agree that immigration reform is much needed, both for legal and undocumented immigrants.  However, your examples are not really indicative of the problems at hand, imo. Those who came to the US as children can get DACA to live, work, and in many cases go to college.  Escaping a complicated family situation (abuse etc) is also doable with a U visa .  As for the dad caring for his son, this is extremely common and extending a tourist visa in such a scenario is quite easy.  I have applied for more then 30 such extensions (including for my aunt when my cousin was involved in a horrific accident, aunt got stay on for more than a year to care for her son).  The main issue imo are the undocumented immigrants who have no options to become legal and legal immigrants who wait years to get their permanent residency.  If you are Indian or Chinese, expect to wait 8-14 years (not including your time spent on education or delayed I 140 filing) to get a green card assuming everything goes well."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,immilaw,6,Tue Apr 14 17:39:54 2015 UTC,lol I have brought it up before :P.
ABCDesis,32kt4f,recycledpaper,2,Tue Apr 14 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! Most of my examples are from the 1980s to early 2000s — the legal landscape was definitely different then. I couldn't have imagined things like the U Visa or the Undocuqueer movement when I was growing up.  Are there more specific (anonymized) stories you can share, of either typical or interesting/exceptional cases?"
ABCDesis,32kt4f,immilaw,10,Tue Apr 14 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm let's see.  I am going to limit myself to desi clients and their struggles to better fit your OP.   Gujarati family came here on a tourist visa and stayed back.  Worked under the table to make ends meet.  Had their minor children adopted by the dad's brother and wife (US citizens), so that the kids would become US citizens too.  10 years later, dad gets sick with a rare disease and gets no help due to his lack of insurance and dies.  This bitch of a nurse reports mom to ICE and she gets put in removal proceedings and she left rather than go through deportation. She has no one in India other than random relatives and her kids can't sponsor her green card because they are technically not her kids anymore.  I was able to work with my Canadian co-counsel and get the mom Canadian citizenship. She now visits and stays with her kids legally for 6-7 months out of the year using her Canadian passport. More typical cases - Loads of workplace abuse on visa holders because they cannot afford to quit/lose their visa status. Common example of legal immigration gone awry - Client came to the US at age 18 as a student, spent 4 years getting his undergrad and 6 more getting his Phd.  He spent 2 years on his OPT, finally got an H1b, and his employer applied for his green card 3 years after he got his H1b.  He is currently waiting for his priority date to become current (8 years ish for Indian citizens with advanced degree).  When he finally gets his green card, he would have lived in the US for 23 years! This guy is a model minority - well educated, no criminal record, pays his taxes, works in HIV research aka contributing to society/humanity and yet he has to wait 23 years before he gets any sense of permanence.   Oh another undocumented case - Pak family fled the country after their daughter got raped in some village as punishment for some wrongdoing.  They went to Mexico and crossed the border secretly.  This is the worst kind of immigration, because they have almost no relief available to them.  The family had spent 4-5 years being undocumented in fear living in Texas.  I eventually decided to try an Asylum claim for the family.  It was incredibly difficult, in part because asylum claims have to be filed within 1 year of entry. After a lot of stressful lawyering, asylum was finally granted and the entire family are permanent residents and can naturalize in a couple years.   Anyway, just a couple stories to illustrate how broken the system is."
ABCDesis,32kt4f,Fanboy0550,4,Tue Apr 14 18:14:39 2015 UTC,A nurse that has the time to report to ICE has too much time on her hands.  I hope she's stuck on wound care duty forever.
ABCDesis,32kt4f,IndianAmericanteen,4,Tue Apr 14 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"I inherited the case from a retired attorney who reported the nurse to the hospital and the state licensing board.  I know for sure that she was fired, no idea if she was disciplined by the board too. It really sucks when medical professionals do this.  It's hard enough for an undocumented immigrant to access medical care, being fearful of being reported is a stress they don't need!"
ABCDesis,32kt4f,mcat36,8,Tue Apr 14 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"It kills me so much because I meet immigrants who have all these fears (perfectly well founded) and that's what prevents them from going to the ER, etc.  I hope more people know this! I try to get pregnant illegal immigrants in the loop since medicaid covers prenatal care (hollllaaaaa) since the baby is a US citizen. No fear of deportation and no fear of a huge expensive bill."

ABCDesis,32k78m,thestinkypig,18,Tue Apr 14 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"Don't know if I'd really call ""Fashion"" a feminist Bollywood movie. That movie made a pretty blatant point about Chopra's character's slide into whoredom, starting from the underwear modeling and culminating in her lowest point of sleeping with a black man. That was just pure what-the-fuckery.  Not to mention the scene where a gay guy asks his friend if she'll marry him and she happily accepts. Because women don't think about being sexually satisfied in marriage, amirite?  English Vinglish was also hugely sexist. The end of that movie drove home that point pretty clearly too."

ABCDesis,32k78m,immilaw,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"Queen bothered me only because of its portrayal of the Western woman's lifestyle. How many aunites watched that movie terrified of their chaste daughters going to live in Europe only to develop a smoking habit, have a child with their ex-boyfriend, become a prostitute in the red light district, and wear promiscuous clothing, like Rani's friends?   Bollywood goes to ridiculous extremes in how they show Western women. They usually perpetuate the stereotype that such women have loose morals, and I didn't see Queen doing much to help with this."

ABCDesis,32kicb,thestinkypig,2,Tue Apr 14 15:02:23 2015 UTC,Do people here have experience with executive education programs such as: http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exed/ or http://www.exed.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx  My company will pay for me to go but I want to go for the right class but what is MORE important is the networking for me with the right people when I take it.  I don't want to go if the right people were there are the previous session.
ABCDesis,32kicb,GWmyc2,3,Tue Apr 14 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"OK, the advice I've been given is to avoid all programs other than the MBA proper, if you want to get the ""right"" network.  Executive MBAs (and other ""executive"" programs) are a cash-earning side hustle for business schools. The idea is that it's pretty easy to get in, but it's very expensive, and a participant in these programs gets to use the name of a prestigious school. (And by extension, your employer gets to say they employ people graduated from Prestigous University, which is why they pay for them.) However, employers (and VCs or whatever) do view ""executive"" programs as a far lesser qualification than the full-time MBA.  The other important thing to keep in mind is that business schools are pretty careful to make sure that the ""executive"" programs and the full-time MBA programs are kept separate. Think of this as ""product differentiation"" between the services they offer. The executive MBA program is not a shortcut to meeting the full-time MBA network. They have separate classes, separate events, and separate trips. Both schools you've mentioned have fairly strict segregation between the two programs.  Knowing where you are in your career, you're better off just working your personal network if you want to get hooked into the GSB and HBS network. Another way to get to know people is to offer mentorship."
ABCDesis,32kicb,thestinkypig,2,Tue Apr 14 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"Based on your background and work, would you go for something related to the entrepreneurship classes?

Granted scaling up and growth-level is also one thing I want to do as well if they offer.  Mostly because there's so many dynamic changes and scaling in different industries is so unique.  Since one of my companies is in such a unique space on it's own, when we do growth-level funding, assuming I'm not pushed out of the picture, I'll want to get classes and the networking will be key for me.  A top level school with instructors on the board or teaching classes from top level PE/VC / government agencies will also help me with the right contacts."

ABCDesis,32fx4k,energyturtle_ak,8,Mon Apr 13 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"On my father's side, I know vaguely about almost six generations. During one of the horrible famines of the late Victorian period in India, sometime between 1870s and 1890s, one of my ancestors left Karnal in Haryana (state bordering Delhi in the north and west) to seek greener pastures in Bihar (I know how that sounds now!).    Probably after the death of his father, my grandfather's grandfather left Bihar to work in Bengal with just two cows (according to family lore). This was sometime in the early 20th century. After a few decades, he had bought up enough land and had enough money to ask for a Permanent Settlement from the British government. It was basically a 99-year lease for a zamindari that gave him rights to tax the people farming the land (sharecroppers) as long as he paid a portion of that to the British. His eldest son, my great-grandfather, was the first person from the family to ever go to middle school. He ended up as one of the few Indian lawyers in the entire district when he graduated from law school.  My maternal grandfather's story is no less legendary. People in his caste almost never went to school beyond the local 'paathshaala' (village elementary school), if at all. In the British India of 1930s where he grew up, there were not enough schools for all Indian kids and only kids who were ""not too stupid for school"" were allowed to attend middle school and higher at the existing Catholic institutions or the few district schools. My grandfather was the only kid in his extended family who earned the distinction of being ""good enough for school"" after elementary. He went on to become the only degree-holding medical doctor in the entire subdivision of probably a million people or more. Mind you, this was the 1950s and not the 19th century, and this was probably the poorest district in the Indian part of Bengal. Even today, it's counted among the poorest districts in India.  He married at the ripe old age of 34 because he wanted to marry an educated woman and wanted to build a house in the city first because ""no educated woman would want to live in a rural thatched-roof house with no indoor plumbing"" (his words).  My grandfather started his medical practice in the late 50s as the only doctor in his subdivision. When he died in the late 90s, his district had a cancer research institute, multiple hospitals and his son was about to run his own nursing home. When he started practice in the 50s, female literacy in India was less than 15% and far lower in his district. In 2001, a few years after his death, it was 59% in his district. Today, it's more than 70%. That's so much change that happened within one lifetime!   What makes me immensely proud of my maternal grandfather and my paternal great-grandfather is that while they were never actively part of the freedom movement or independent India's politics, they were the active embodiment of change in pre and post-independent India. They were the silent minority who showed that change is possible and paved the way for so many others to follow them."

Dad's side is pretty cool. Our ancestral village is located in ""Malwa,"" the eastern-most region of Punjab. We live near Sirhind/Patiala, if that helps reference it for anyone. The first and ninth Sikh Gurus visited our area, and my ancestral village has a tomb dedicated to some of our ancestors who died in a battle providing aid to the tenth Guru.   This village also got a blacklist during the colonial period because we tarred and feathered the tax collector.  After that, we were pretty similar to an archetype colonial rural Sikh family: developed land in Western Punjab (Lyallpur/Faisalabad area), fought in WWII and kept a machine gun that was later used for defense while crossing the border back into India. We settled in a formerly Muslim village in Malwa again, an hour away from our ancestral village.  In Punjab, most villages are made up of kinsmen, or distant relatives. This is why it's taboo to marry within a village, many villages have people of one last name or are named after a last name (""Gill"" village for example), and also why there's a strong community and family tie to the village as it is essentially composed of your tribe. My dad's village didn't really have any of this since it was made up of various people from Pakistan settling, so they couldn't even have Jaago and it was very conservative with women not leaving the house after dark."

When that happened, since it all became a part of British India, my great grandfather joined the Congress party and traveled 1,500 miles all the way to Chennai and married a woman there. He then returned to Malakand, after spending some time there.  So I think it's strange and cool that we have some South Indian relatives. We met some of them in America, and it's amazing how different we are. Our entire region is so diverse!  For reference: http://imgur.com/ib8svmb"

I did some family history stuff recently (really, just asking my parents about what they knew, since there's no records of my family in Pakistan) and I found out that my last name is a Baloch tribal name. Don't know what that entails, but I believe my family is indigenous to India in general (pre-partition).

Apparently our forefathers built a temple in our ancestral village (which also happens to be our last name) - and this village is in Rayalseema.   I think this is pretty cool because Rayalseema, Andhra and Telangana are the three major regions of the Telugu state (that was once) Andhra Pradesh. After the Telangana separation, Rayalseema's been campaigning for a separate state too. If that ever happens it's interesting to think that I'd be linked to 3 different states, all of which are Telugu, and all of which speak very different dialects of Telugu :P  I knew very few Telugu people growing up, so almost all my Telugu vocab was restricted to what you'd speak at home. I knew my vocab was limited but I didn't realize that I spoke a recognizable dialect with very little knowledge of slang/ colloquialisms. When I spent a few years in Hyderabad I was constantly surprised when people would ask me if my parents were from Nellore :P My favorite moments were when I'd use a phrase and everyone else was baffled for a change - apparently something like ""taareTlu aaDaddu""* stumped anyone who didn't know the Nellore dialect :)  My paternal grandfather was a Physics professor; all his grandchildren are engineers (out of choice) now. His brother was a lawyer and a number of his grandchildren are lawyers!  * ""taareTlu aaDaddu"" is a phrase that's used for ""don't drag your feet"" or ""stop loitering"" or ""hurry up"".

She was the baby of the family, and her parents died when she was still a kid, so when she graduated high school she moved to Mumbai to live with her brother and work at the railway station. When she was 30 her brother arranged her marriage to my mom's dad. He was the youngest of a really big family in Pune. One day he just packed up and disappeared. A few months later he sent his family a letter saying he was in England. They were both basically the misfits of their families and their relatives just wanted to get them married off quickly. He came back to India to marry my grandma then made her pack up all her stuff and move to England.  My mom and uncle were born in England. They didn't have very much money, and dealt with a lot of racism in England, so they decided to move to Canada and then the US (Wisconsin). My mom's dad didn't treat them very well, so shortly after they moved to Wisconsin, my mom's parents went through a really nasty divorce.

My parents have lived in the US for 20 odd years now, and all that time they missed the authentic Malaysian open-air restaurant food of their youth. Now, if you've ever had authentic Malaysian food, you would understand because it is really, really good; a combination of both Southern Chinese and Indian dishes and cooking styles.  A few years ago, however, a nice Malaysian expat opened a restaurant almost right next to us that made this same authentic Malaysian food. The restaurant was a rousing success, and needless to say, we were all very happy and ate there all the time (The manager is our friend now). However, upon going back to Malaysia last year, the same food sold in its very country of origin just didn't taste that good anymore in comparison to the food in the US.  I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the better quality of the ingredients used. The noodles we eat over here seem to have a lot more starch and are richer and more filling. American palates, including those of immigrants who have lived here for a while (the main patrons of this restaurant), are also used to a higher quality of salt, spice, and sauce. So a Malaysian person who legitimately knows what they are doing with the food can definitely manage to make authentic dishes that taste better to Americans than the originals, especially if the originals are from cash and resource strapped open-air corner restaurants in a not-so-wealthy country."

No one in my mother's side of the family has ever gotten a nose piercing. Apparently it is highly discouraged and somewhat of a taboo for a Kashmiri woman to get a nose-ring. Since Kashmir is generally colder than Punjab, Kashmiri households do not feature South Asian favorites like lassi, yoghurt, and mithai. It's considered non-existent. Kashmiris eat very heavy amounts of red meat for breakfast. They also very rarely indulge in roti, preferring rice instead."
ABCDesis,32fx4k,IzmailPirzada,6,Mon Apr 13 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Had no idea someone in North India prefers rice over roti. South India works in that way, too. Pretty cool!"
ABCDesis,32fx4k,x6tance,7,Mon Apr 13 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"It all has to do with climate, according to my mom. It used to freeze over up there (akin to standing in Boston in December with a banyaan on). Kashmiris also prefer their milk warm, never cold, and we don't even have a specific, codified form of breakfast, instead we used to just eat leftover meat from the night before."
ABCDesis,32fx4k,IzmailPirzada,6,Mon Apr 13 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I do know that Kashmir has alotta mountains and hills, and rice can grow there (and like, anywhere, lol!), so, it makes sense when you think of it.   And yeah. My family in India likes their milk warm. But in America, we all drink it cold. Weird!"
ABCDesis,32fx4k,x6tance,3,Mon Apr 13 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"My family (both paternal and maternal) has lived in Tamil Nadu for generations, although we are ethnically Kannadigas. Both sides have strong ties to Salem, which is a city near the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. My grandfather's great-grandmother migrated from a town in Western Karnataka called Sringeri, but other than that I don't know how we ended up scattered about Tamil Nadu. Today we don't really have any ties to Karnataka apart from language (sort of).   We speak an odd dialect of Kannada that is solely used, to the best of my knowledge, by members of our family, and by extension our caste. I can sort of make out what standard Kannada speakers are saying, but it always sounds a little funny to me (and certainly vice-versa!). Some people say our Kannada sounds like a blend of Tamil and standard Kannada. One time I looked up ancient and middle Kannada, and was surprised to find that certain phrases from our Kannada resemble middle Kannada quite closely. I'm not sure if this idea has any merit, but it'd be interesting if it turned out that my ancestors preserved an older version of Kannada when they migrated to Tamil Nadu.   Since both my parents grew up in Tamil Nadu, they sometimes spoke in Tamil to each other at home, but never to me or my sister. However, due to a combination of watching Tamil films with subtitles growing up, family friends, and the relative similarity of the two languages, I can understand Tamil quite well to the point of watching movies and TV shows without subtitles.   Another interesting tidbit: My great-grandfather went to Malaysia in the early 20th century as a child laborer. He eventually became very successful in the textiles business and died a rich man. My grandma, owing to her residence in Malaysia, spent part of her childhood living under Japanese occupation. I was surprised to hear that the Japanese soldiers gave candy to her and her siblings."
ABCDesis,32fx4k,brownap,5,Mon Apr 13 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, I love this post! Interesting discussions like this are why I joined the sub in the first place :)  So, my family history in general is pretty boring, I think, but then again, I don't know more than about five or six generations back.   Mom's side: My mother's side of the family is from the Hassan district of Karnataka. My great-grandmother (my mom's dad's mom) was from a long line of coffee growers, and so my grandfather's family has a strong connection to the coffee growing industry in South India. My grandfather grew up in a village called Ponnathpura, where his mother and father also farmed (mainly dairy, I think, in addition to vegetables and such.) In the 70's, I think, the Indian government bought all the land in Ponnathpura and surrounding villages, and built a dam in that area, flooding all the villages. At this point, my grandfather and his brothers scattered: some of them stayed in Hassan and continued farming, but my grandfather got his engineering degree and relocated to Bombay to try and figure out post-village life.   Fun fact: my grandfather's mother's side of the family dealt with colonial-era Brits a lot, due to the buying/selling of coffee, and there's a not-so-secret rumor that some British blood made its way into our family. I don't know how true this is, but I'm willing to bet it's not total hogwash.   Dad's side: I don't know a lot about my dad's side of the family (mostly because we were never very close with them- my dad wasn't even all that close with his parents.) I know that my dad's side of the family is from a village around Bangalore (officially I think they say they're from Kanakpur, but I think they're from a smaller village around there.) The only interesting thing I know about my dad's side of the family was that he had a great-great grandmother who lived to over 100 years old. My dad remembers talking to her when he was a child, and says that she didn't really have a permanent home or anything- she just wandered around and slept at temples/ashrams and ate whatever food was given to her. He also said she was a seer of sorts, and would go into these trances, and predict things about the future. I dunno how much of what she predicted came true, but I thought it was kind of a cool fact."

ABCDesis,32fx4k,TaazaPlaza,2,Mon Apr 13 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the Indus Valley script is still undeciphered. I've heard the fire rituals being used to show a connection between 'Aryans' and Indus Valley too. Rather, 'Aryans' picked it up after migrating around the area.  As for proto Dravidian, it would predate Sanskrit, and according to Wiki, proto languages are 'usually hypothetical or reconstructed, and unattested'. So what are you basing this on? Old Tamil itself is  attested only from a certain date, forget about its deep ancestors.  And I do think it's relevant. People settling in places don't completely change the genetic makeup of the regions. Punjabis aren't 100% Aryan, when Aryan/Dravidian aren't even 'races' or genetic types or whatever. Even if you believe ASI/ANI genes correspond to an Aryan/Dravidian genetic dichotomy, people of the region have mixed ASI and ANI genes, and so do people in TN which is said to be the most Dravidian region culturally and linguistically. Regardless of Dravidian or Aryan, the people living in the region in and around the IV civ will have the most genetic continuity with them. Ie Sindhis, Gujaratis and Punjabis.  As for the art, the same comparison has been made between Sindhi woodblock printing, Sindhi clothing and ancient artifacts from the IV sites.  Honestly I think the IV civilization died out and only lives on in traces in Sindh and Gujarat, and parts that got assimilated and spread.  TLDR, No strong evidence, so it's just a hypothesis at best."
ABCDesis,32fx4k,TaazaPlaza,2,Mon Apr 13 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense. Nothing is known about the language because it's not known what the script says. How can an unknown language be compared to a language that is reconstructed from modern languages? First decipher the script and we can begin to find out about the language and its connections. It's not even known what language family their language was in. Yet you're sure it was Dravidian, somehow.  The cultural connections you make are pretty tenuous at best.  Again, it's just a theory. Nothing to suggest it's a fact yet. If it was solved it would be a huge deal."

ABCDesis,32fogi,farpastinfinity,10,Wed Apr 15 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty good relationship with my parents! It was strained when I was growing up, but nothing out of the ordinary I think - I wanted to go to art school, my dad freaked out, etc. They were definitely overprotective when it came to going out and such.  Our personalities clash sometimes. My mom likes debates - and so does my brother - but that stresses me out. My dad and I have similar personalities, as in we're both pretty quick to anger. If we all spend too much time together we start getting on each others nerves."
ABCDesis,32fogi,bug-bear,15,Mon Apr 13 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"I have a great relationship with my parents. I'm fortunate that they are far more accepting, tolerant, and forward thinking than most. This has been key in maintaining a close relationship with them throughout my life. It was always clear that the sacrifices they made for us kids were selfless and no-strings-attached. They never held it over our heads to get us to do something they wanted to increase their social capital among their friends/family, and that's far too common in Indian culture; that behavior pretty much invalidates the ""parents did so much for their kids future"" meme.  I didn't have an arranged marriage. I married a caucasian woman. My parents absolutely love her to death. There are a handful of interracial marriages in my ""close"" extended family, so there's definitely a pattern of bucking the cultural traditions. My mom and dad are 66 and 74 respectively, so they definitely come from the old school.  I was never taught Malayalam growing up, my dad thought it was a waste of time, though this is one thing I kinda wish they did differently. I don't think knowledge of any language can ever have a downside."
ABCDesis,32fogi,b_digital,2,Mon Apr 13 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"Man, reading your parent's ages reminded me of my own. My dad is turning 61 in three days, and my mom just turned 50. I'm only a freshman in college (I arrived very late in the picture).  Sometimes I feel as if my parents, especially my dad, won't be there to see me when I finally reach the pinnacle of adulthood.   They don't have the mindset of ""you should succeed  solely for our/the family's sake"", but I would want nothing more than for them to be a part of my life when I have my own family."
ABCDesis,32fogi,IzmailPirzada,3,Mon Apr 13 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"yeah my dad was 37 when I was born and i'm the oldest. I'm probably a bit older than most of the folks on this sub at 36.  Thankfully both of my parents are in great health for their age and have been around for my two kids (7yrs and 9mos) but there's only so much time left.   Oddly enough, despite being the most rebellious in my extended family, I'm the one who got married, had kids, settled down well before my sister and all of my cousins who grew up here.   most of the others, especially my cousins fell into the trap of chasing the ""Indian prestige dream"" and into their early thirties now haven't really started their adult life yet. The academic accomplishments are certainly brag-worthy (doctors, lawyers, PhDs, a dentist), but i'm not sure in all cases they pursued those because that's really what they wanted to do vs what they felt pressured into doing to satisfy their parents.   I have one cousin who flat out told me she really didn't want to go to med school but didn't know how to tell her parents, and didn't have any idea what she'd do instead.   Anyway, this long tangent was to say, some of my aunts and uncles have confessed to my mom that they're jealous of the fact that they don't have grandkids now (much less married for some), and have no idea if they'll live long enough to enjoy them. They wonder if pushing them so hard towards the money and prestige was a mistake because they'll keep putting off marriage and/or kids to focus on the next degree, achievement, career milestone.   Another reason I'm so close to my parents is that they let me take the education and career route I wanted. I was never pressured into anything, though I did naturally gravitate to engineering (my childhood was spent taking anything apart that was within reach, trying to blow stuff up in the backyard, etc.). I've always maximized my own happiness over prestige, and to some degree, money. (though I am realistic about the convenience in how my career lends itself to a pretty good standard of living, and i'm lucky that I enjoy it)."
ABCDesis,32fogi,b_digital,3,Mon Apr 13 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"That's actually very interesting. I arrived late in the picture not because my parents were busy chasing the degrees (they got them regardless), but because of my elder two siblings (10 years and 9 years older than me), the latter had a congenital birth defect. My parents wanted a third child, but thought it would be unfair if the child were to arrive and he/she wasn't healthy, so they were hesitant for a while before taking the plunge."
ABCDesis,32fogi,IzmailPirzada,2,Mon Apr 13 19:46:00 2015 UTC,Interesting. My mom is from Kerala and my dad from West Bengal.  My biggest disappointment is that they didn't raise me in a bilingual household (and of course I resisted going to class - but it was only an option they presented to see if I was interested).  They said they didn't think it was going to be useful/was unnecessary.

It's so earnest that it just makes me feel super awesome even at my most homesick.   I'm also close with my nanima who was my acting mother for my entire life. She's stern and has some curious ideas that date her poorly, but deep down she loves her family, protects them fiercely, and guides them as best she can. She's a strong and lovely woman and if I had to have a mum that's not my birth one, I'd pick her every time.   Parental units are fantastic!!! ;D (I get it from my father, sorry)"
ABCDesis,32fogi,Jirni,5,Mon Apr 13 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have an amazing relationship with my parents and little need to hide my various antics.   Fortunately, both of my parents are extremely liberal, open-minded and intelligent. They're also very social and are a lot of fun to be with at parties.  So, as a result, they put up with a lot of my shit when I was growing up and never placed any kind of emphasis on who or what I should be. I think this is partially reflected in the fact that their career/life options were limited according to the needs of life in mid 20th century India..  I think my parents successfully pursued passions that were important to them but may have wanted greater flexibility in the life choices they made so they tried to allow me to become the person I am, on my own terms.  That parenting style has a lot of ups and downs, but it's given me a strong sense of pride that so much of my growth has come from my own decisions. I can't thank them enough for that."

I've been through the ""omg I hate them"" phase so I really do empathize with the majority of these posts. I think we see a lot of them because non brown people don't get the restrictions we have and this may be the one place some people can just vent.

ABCDesis,32gr7q,GWmyc2,2,Tue Apr 14 10:25:27 2015 UTC,Aw don't say that. There's plenty of great arcs happening in the background but they're really skinning the book out.

I have a network in most of these places that I'd be able to tap to see if I could continue in my line of work to support myself. If that's not an option, I could try to do something else - say, teaching. I like teaching and I would try to work towards doing that.   It would definitely be different, every place and time in your life is different but that's the beauty of it all! Perhaps this doesn't sound very scary to me because I am only responsible for myself - I don't have a mortgage or a family to support so if all I have to do is transplant myself somewhere else and learn to live in a new place, and make new friends I think I would be okay doing that.

ABCDesis,32chuk,gulab_jammin3,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I used to feel super guilty as well, when I would 'disappoint' my parents with my wild behaviour (i.e. hanging out at the mall with a group of friends that included a boy or two).  I learned to not share certain information with them because I know they'd just over-react.   Please, please, please don't ever feel bad about yourself. Like all parents, desi parents want the best for you, but unfortunately sometimes their expectation are too unrealistic and these expectations require you to sacrifice your own identity.  Don't let them project their vision of a perfect daughter onto you. It's not fair because you are your own person. The next time you  do something 'wrong' and your mother starts to wail and thump her fist to her chest, crying out, ""but you were such a good girl!!"", take a deep breath and remember that you are an awesome person. Don't let them make you think otherwise. PM if you need to vent! I know when I was your age, I really needed someone to vent to."

If you have a job, you are old enough to start exercising some autonomy. It is completely unfair for them to act as if they are obligated to know where you are at all time because you are so incapable that the only reason you wouldn't tell them is because you are up to no good. You are able to make your own decisions and have the right to your mistakes.   I honestly believe that your parents are in the wrong."

ABCDesis,32chuk,LotusEyes92,2,Mon Apr 13 01:15:20 2015 UTC,Probably not because it was pretty shady.

Eleanor is admirable and strong and awesome too, but she never had to face threat of torture to get her business done. But Eleanor is maybe more relatable in that way, which is maybe a plus.

ABCDesis,329rv1,arjun10,9,Sat Apr 11 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"Greenpeace has effectively crippled the Golden Rice project. First it complained that the rice would escape into the wild, so people put the Terminator Sequence (courtesy of Monsanto who donated the technology) into the Golden Rice sequence.   Then Greenpeace said Golden Rice was a monopoly despite it being offered at cost across the world because you couldn't breed from it. Basically? Greenpeace wanted a crop plant that couldn't grow in the wild and cross breed there but could cross breed in a field which means they wanted you to turn left and right at the same time.   So many children are blinded every year. So many fish are killed JUST for their oil to stop this blindness. In fact? The ENTIRE cost of the Golden Rice Program is the same as what India spends YEARLY on Vit A prophylaxis. JUST India adopting it would be a saving!  But nope! Greenpeace!  Greenpeace literally is a bunch of people who think you can power 1.2 billion people's rising energy costs through magical thinking and wishing on stars rather than renewables. Hell? India CAN go down a Thorium Reactor route for safe usable nuclear power but nope. India has NIMBY problems which Greenpeace loves!  Let's look at where I work. Rural Tamil Nadu.   I work in a hospital that has power cuts. Our operation costs are enormous due to them because we have to have a generator. Most hospitals do have them but they don't run them except in emergencies. We run it daily. I don't know about Greenpeace but I am pretty sure mini generators aren't as clean burning as a power plant.   Oh and Greenpeace has complained about Wind Power too."

I had more family and truer friends back home, I really belonged as opposed to being a novelty who was here to boost the economy. Back in India I could feel the country reverberate and change under my feet and it was exciting. I want to be a part of the story of India's rise rather than living just for my own comfort. This generation is lucky to have that chance.  There is also an overbearing order and predictability to life here that I cannot deal with forever, it feels like I'm eating tapas instead of a hearty meal of life.  I admire the US and it has been welcoming to me, yet there have been many times that I felt compelled to talk or act a certain way to conform. So I'll work hard, save up and return to the only place I ever loved despite it's blemishes."
ABCDesis,326rwq,fununclebob,5,Mon Apr 13 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"I have thought about it. Even though I was born and grew up in the US, I visit India regularly and I enjoy it and I don't feel out of place there. Most of my family is there too. My cousin and I would eventually inherit my grandfather's house, and I know I would never want to sell it. It has too much personal value, especially knowing how much effort my grandfather put into it and how he made it his new home when he was displaced from his old one (Partition of India).  That being said, at this point in my life I don't foresee myself moving there permanently anytime soon. I like the personal space I have in the US, and the freedom to do as I please (either legally or socially). The over-religiosity of India is annoying and bothersome to me after a while (especially coming from a part of the US where people are not religious and don't bother about it in public), and I find the current RSS/BJP/VHP-style politicization of religion troubling. I'm also gay and India is just too stifling an atmosphere for that at this point, with constant prying eyes.  My mom is seriously thinking about retiring to India in the coming years and she and my aunt have started hinting that they want me to come along and get a job there. As much as I value their opinions, I am not about other people deciding my life for me, and I am young and have more a future here in this country than in India. My field is far more innovative in this country than in India too. I also worry that my mom, who hasn't lived in India since the late 70s and feels more lost and culture shock than I do in India, will have a tough time. Not to mention the severe air pollution in Delhi that effectively turns your lungs into those of a smoker."

I don't know if I could personally retire in Pakistan. Even though I was born there, I've lived my whole life in the US. Assuming I stay in the US for my entire professional life, I don't think it would make sense for me to move to Pakistan after retiring. It would be a weird transition.  If anything, I'd be more likely to move there in my 30s or 40s if I found a job there that I felt could really help the country rise from being -- as some might call it -- a ""festering shithole"""

ABCDesis,326rwq,TaazaPlaza,3,Sun Apr 12 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"In the US it is risky to expect your kids to take care of you when you get old. If you do just average and don't become independently wealthy during your prime working years, your govt pension pays enough to barely keep you above poverty if you have no other retirement income. If you've become accustomed to a certain standard of living, it may not be possible to maintain that during the time in your life you should be taking it easy.  Many people in the US move to countries in South America to live somewhere warm and relatively affordable for very comfortable accommodations near major cities.   I figure Pakistan has got to improve somewhat in a couple of decades. Plus I was born there with some family still in the country, so I imagine I would have some basis for acquiring property. Rather than move to some place where I don't know the language, I figure in PK, at least we'll be able to communicate with those around us."
ABCDesis,327i06,ShereOnFire,6,Sat Apr 11 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"Great post.  The video wasn't available for me to watch in the U.S., so here's a mirror in case anyone else needs it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmJNsvc63pM  Sadhguru, not surprisingly, said most of what I was going to say but of course far better than I could.  What I would add is this: my personal experience of yoga is that it is ultimately about realizing our true identity.  Our bodies (and even our egos/self-concepts) are not that true identity, merely temporary vehicles we use until no longer needed.  The delusion is not only to think yoga ""belongs"" to anyone, but that anything ""belongs"" to anyone.  What can be taken away was never what we truly were anyway.  Attachment to yoga asana practice is just like attachment to anything: if we fear losing it, then we still have more work to do on realizing what we really are.  That which we really are is not afraid of losing anything, because nothing that can be lost is real anyway.  Ultimately, yoga can never really be taken from us.  Can you breathe?  You can do yoga.  Washing the dishes can be yoga.  Eating your breakfast can be yoga.  Asana is just one branch, but not the tree and certainly not its root.  Even if every pose was copyrighted and patented, silly as that would be, no one can be stopped from doing yoga.  To realize the goal of yoga is to be free of fear, and while I personally do advocate that the word yoga not be misused...I'm not afraid of people misusing it.  That'll inevitably happen, and I'll speak up if I personally see it happen; but I'm not going to start a war over it, otherwise I've become as lost as those I'm criticizing.  Am I practicing yoga properly and faithfully?  Am I staying focused on its true goal?  That's what matters, not what anyone else is doing.  Edit: forgot a word, and as a former English major I'm attached to proper sentences."
ABCDesis,327i06,darthrevan,2,Sat Apr 11 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"That's the first time I've heard of a YouTube video not being able to be played in the U.S. sorry about that.   Yeah the sun quote was something you would expect from a Sadhu very poetic and insightful at the same time. I'm not sure if it was you but you mentioned a while ago that at first you disliked white people owning yoga studios but after spending time you realised that they knew more about yoga then most Indians.  Was that you?  I like that the goal of yoga is to be free of fear.  I'm stealing it. From reading the Gita I always thought that yoga is used to clear your head from any thoughts so you can do your duty properly.   What did you think of the phrase of forget zen be fabulous? I really didn't like how some people want to patent or trademark poses from yoga. For me that's a big issue and  the second issue is,I don't want yoga to be like a fad like how martial arts was in the 80s. Everyone opened their own dojo and in return people were taught fake and not things that could be used in the real world. Yoga should be taught by certified people who actually know what their doing and know both the spiritual and physical.  What they choose to teach should be up to them but they need to know both."
ABCDesis,327i06,darthrevan,2,Sun Apr 12 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"That's the first time I've heard of a YouTube video not being able to be played in the U.S. sorry about that.   No worries.  When I try to load it up, I get a message saying: ""The uploader has not made this video available in your country.""  I tried both Chrome and IE, got the same result.  Not sure what's up (maybe it's just my own settings or something), but no biggie luckily I found another link that worked.   I'm not sure if it was you but you mentioned a while ago that at first you disliked white people owning yoga studios but after spending time you realised that they knew more about yoga then most Indians. Was that you?   Probably, I have said that several times.  And it's absolutely true.  I think the guy who did this video also says something along those lines toward the beginning.   I like that the goal of yoga is to be free of fear. I'm stealing it. From reading the Gita I always thought that yoga is used to clear your head from any thoughts so you can do your duty properly.   This is a big topic of course, but to respond as briefly as possible: I define the goal of yoga as being free of fear because ultimately the only thing stopping us from doing our duty (dharma) is fear.  What is the root of fear?  Attachment to our bodies, our egos, our false self.  The only way to truly become fearless is to realize--completely and without a shred of doubt--who you really are: the immortal, indestructible, indivisible Self that only wears these bodies like clothes (like Krishna says in Gita 2.22).    Based on that, here's my interpretation of the Gita (for what it's worth as a non-scholar): On a surface level Arjuna says he doesn't want to kill people he respects and loves, but Krishna sees right through that.  He knows what's really stopping Arjuna that he'd feel guilty about it.  That should be a good thing right?  No, actually it's not because it means Arjuna's just wrapped up in himself and his own mind.  He doesn't actually care about the people on the other side of that field, he just cares about himself--the image he has in his own mind of being a ""good"" person.  Krishna wants Arjuna to stop doing actions merely as ""self-image enhancement"" because that only traps him further in delusion.    Dharma is not being a ""good"" person, it's being in harmony with the Cosmic Order.  The Cosmic Order is infinitely more complex than the human mind will ever comprehend, and beyond human conceptions of good and evil.  Therefore all human-made ethics and customs will always fall short in some way.  Krishna and/or other sages in touch with Cosmic Truth come again and again to continuously update our understandings to help us re-align with the Cosmic Order.  Ultimately you can't ""know"" it or ""understand"" it with the human brain, you can only know it in the sense of being a channel for it by eliminating what is false in you.  Thus Krishna teaches that if you can't realize the Self in your ""self"", then focus on Him and concentrate your mind on Him so that you can let go of your ""self"".  And now from the sublime to the ridiculous, lol:   What did you think of the phrase of forget zen be fabulous?    It is a perfect modern day motto for maya.  That woman is a perfect example of how maya always pushes back against Truth in the Cosmic Order.  Ultimately, that's what all this ""appropriation"" of yoga is really about: maya striking back against truth.  Sri Ramakrishna taught this, that yes we need to wake up but the illusion is the power of God, too.  It wants to enjoy this game, and keep it going.  So don't worry about it, don't think ""you"", this tiny self, can stop the Universal Game, and instead just focus on realizing the truth.  That's your only job, the rest is God's."

We don't know their stories, do we? That white person could be married to a religious hindu and wants to follow the family's traditions?   There are just too many individualistic differences in ""white people"" that blanket statements like: ""White people pls stahp wearing bindis coz it's offensive"" do more harm to the discussions about cultural appropriation than good because it IS literally generalizing based on race."

My question is more about, why is it offensive? Its a globalized world. Everything has gone everywhere, people all over the world are learning and becoming part of a global culture. The food you eat, the language you speak, the clients you work for, the people you work with are from all over the world and we've all got parts of other cultures in us. Its normal. It happens. I speak German and I wear lederhosen and drink beer during Oktoberfest. Is that appropriation of German culture? Why is the bindi and mehendi singled out as being offensive to one of the oldest civilizations and cultures in the world? I still find it hard to believe that cultural appropriation especially of Indians (2nd biggest population in the world) is an issue in 2015.  P.S. forgive me if I'm ranting and if I haven't actually understood the point of cultural appropriation.

If someone decides to wear a Sari, a Thawb, a ""Native American"" outfit, a turban, for Halloween or some costume party, then yes, that shit is offensive as hell. If someone wears it as an appreciation for someone's cultural traditions, then I appreciate their efforts, and if someone just wears it because its pretty, I mean, that's their choice, but I can see why people would have a problem with it. They're making your culture an accessory without even having second thoughts.  Yes, we live in a globalized world, so expect to learn things about other people instead of continuing to live in your own bubble, void of any cultural interaction. There are people out there who will wear a bindi, do Yoga in the morning and wear a Kurta to a brunch but make no Indian friends, do not associate with others outside of their racial, socio-economic background and I think that is deemed offensive by many."

ABCDesis,320uy0,FixinThePlanet,14,Fri Apr 10 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"As an India-born Indian, now living in the US, the way I differentiate between appropriation and sharing is this.  If there is an activity that both Indian-origin Americans and other Americans can do, either without judgement or facing equal judgement from the general population, it's not appropriation. Since holi and color run both seem to be accepted festive occasions, I don't consider the color run as appropriation but rather corporatization of a cultural practice, which happens all the time with almost any festival.   On the other hand, if wearing a saree gets an Indian woman stares and awkward conversation while a White woman is lauded for 'celebrating ethnic wear', that's appropriation.   Basically, social attitudes to an activity often differ based on who is doing it. Black Americans with guns are not seen the same way as White American gun enthusiasts. Native Americans wearing feathers are weird and possibly dangerous but White models with feathers are cute. My parameter is that if Indian-origin people don't get the same treatment for an activity as other American groups, then the other group (especially if they are socially powerful) is essentially appropriating the customs i.e. doing it themselves while making it, or at least, keeping it hard for Indians to do the same.  As far as engaging with appropriation is concerned, a lot depends on your relationship with the person. If that person does something that I will feel uncomfortable doing because of my ethnicity, I might rib the person and let them know that I will not be able to do this for whatever reason or just let them know that I feel really uncomfortable with what they are doing. On the flip side, encouraging your non-Indian friends to join you in a traditionally Indian activity like navratri wearing lehnga and kurta or inviting them to a party with mostly your Indian friends is a great start at normalizing Indian things and making them less weird for others."
ABCDesis,320uy0,akbar-great_chai-tea,14,Thu Apr 9 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"Well, a very dear white friend of mine once joked (mostly) that he'd apply ""brown paint"" and go as Indian for halloween. I reminded him that he was basically talking about going in blackface. He was quite shocked and super apologetic. It just didn't occur to him, that's all. If Hindu weddings had a best man concept, he'd be my best man even now.  I think white people walk a thin line between respect, admiration for cultures, adopting said cultures, having fun with some stereotypes, and racism. I don't doubt for a second that non-white people can be racist, but that burden is the heaviest for white people.  So how do you feel when you see a non Indian wear a bindi or a saree? Would you freak out if it's a latina?   I just feel like I, even though Indian, do not have the right to dictate who wears what and how much of thought goes behind it. I once bought a cowboy hat from a Native American store in NM and wore it that night in a bar. Did I misappropriate something there? I don't know, I was new to the US and really wanted a cowboy hat and I honestly didn't care how stupid I looked (VERY).  If we're talking strictly in the context of what the bindi represents for the Hindus, I'd like to remind people that no scripture talks about Indians having exclusive rights to it.   Desi culture is very accommodating and I think we have bigger battles to fight than stress about a 16 year old wearing something on her forehead."

They're just appreciating what the culture does for them.

ABCDesis,320uy0,RotiRoll,6,Thu Apr 9 22:04:35 2015 UTC,"This is how I understand it: Appropriation, assimilation, and cultural exchange have to do with power differentials.  When there's cultural exchange going on, the parties involved are acting as equals. If my Puerto Rican friend teaches me how to make pozole and I teach her how to make saaru, that's exchange.   Indians, African Americans and Latinos dressing up in suits for work is assimilation because they are all minority groups conforming to dominant group customs to survive. Appropriation is a dominant group janking stuff and traditions from minority groups. It's very likely a Lakota would consider every other group in this country appropriative when they wear war bonnets for fun."
ABCDesis,320uy0,Anandya,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:11:40 2015 UTC,There is also an element of acceptability.   It's unacceptable to show up to most things dressed like an Indian Prince no matter how over the top formal that outfit is. It's perfectly sensible to wear a really drab suit. If a white person gets our Sherwani then it instantly becomes cooler and a more fashionable statement than if we wore it despite it being part of our culture.   That's how I see it.

Say what you may about cultural appropriation, the song and the album rips hard. To me, its awesome to see a Russian band embrace our culture in non-mainstream musical avenues, and writing music without the aim of appealing to a new audience while Indian musicians still continue to echo the West and ignore their own culture.  Czech black metal band Cult Of Fire' s album मृत्यु का तापसी अनुध्यान is another example of Europeans paying tribute to our culture. This I like. This I can accept and stand by. I don't think our cultures are for us to own and not share with the world. If there is a genuine interest in what is ours, why can't we share it with the world?  EDIT: The examples people post when it comes to cultural appropriation are always the same - Iggy Azalea, white people wearing bindis and mehendi, African American examples and thats getting stale to me. And since I didnt grow up in the US, I can't relate to what a lot of the ABCDs went through in the past. But NOW. In 2015. I think our culture is open for all and we can't use examples from the past any more.  EDIT EDIT: I'm really tired and I may not have been clear.

I've seen straight up Kurtas being sold online as ""Bohemian tunic"", there's no tribute there at all.

ABCDesis,320uy0,FobTurnedCD,10,Fri Apr 10 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"Lets try to define appropriation that we need to be concerned about:  When native americans or black americans talk about cultural appropriation, there is a history there. These communities have experienced horrific abuse at the hands of the white majority. So when such a majority actively appropriates cultural artifacts then that is a matter of concern. (e.g:iggy azalea's ghetto accent, team mascots running around with american indian headdress... )   The concern is not that blacks & native americans are minorities - but that they are minorities that have been seriously exploited & oppressed (and in many case are still being mistreated) , and now the exploiters are exploiting the few things that these communities have.   Appropriation harms communities in multiple ways: complete lack of access (Egyptian frescoes in Paris),  ambiguity of ownership rights (Iggy's accent which is actually a NY ghetto accent), denigration of sacred artifacts (eg. the toilet covers & shoes featuring hindu gods).  So when we feel something from our culture has been appropriated, we can put them in one of the two buckets. First bucket, where the appropriation is blatantly offensive (e.g. the offensive use of sacred indian artifacts) or second, where it is potentially something indians use/wear (bindi) but it is not really offensive.  When it is offensive - I think we do need to protest. With things like bindis.. I think we need to just let it be.   Finally, we do need to remember that we have a huge cultural identity in the world, and that we are not a disadvantaged minority here in the US. Like most cultural artifacts, they will be used/modified by other cultures and used, just like we Indians modify other's cultural symbols for our own use.   Note: [Bindis are more of a decoration rather than something sacred.  Yes sidoor is considered sacred, but sindoor is kumkum placed on the forehead whereas bindis are cheap plastic substitutes that come in multitude of colors, shapes and sizes! and are more of a fashion statement."

ABCDesis,320uy0,frackaracka,5,Thu Apr 9 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the strength of a slippery slope argument depends on the strength of the initial claim.

Additionally, yes, everything has a meaning. But if you let someone who gets offended at everything to rule, you will end up with nothing - like the ill-thought of beef ban in India.   Eating beef (or horse meat) is not an offense in hinduism (it's taste is actually extolled in some vedas).  But a majority of hindus do not eat beef and that has been taken to the extreme and beef has been banned in some states in India (the tyranny of the majority). Even worse, India is one of the largest beef exporters in the world - that will continue inspite of the beef ban!

ABCDesis,320uy0,LotusEyes92,2,Fri Apr 10 10:15:39 2015 UTC,"I thought South Indians always wore mehendi.   Regarding the second point, I've noticed that a lot of the Muslim or Christian women who wear bindis tend to be people who have recently converted and continue to hold on to some of the traditions, or live in a majority Hindu city/village/town and adopt these practices due to that.   For the women that don't do it for either of these reasons and just like wearing Bindis I think its absolutely fine. Just like I personally think its completely fine for Non-South Asians girls to wear bindis. My problem, personally, is with the lack of cultural sensitivity that some show (like Selena Gomez. I know its an old example but I don't care. There are no expiry dates on these things)."

It feels like every other thread in this sub has been about this subject lately and I honestly don't get it. I'm not trying to be glib, I just don't see the correlation between a white woman wearing a bindi and Desi people suffering as a result.  I think culture is about spreading ideas, aesthetics, forms. Why perpetuate this sense of ""this is ours."" I honestly, truly don't think Indian culture is diminished when Selena Gomez wears a bindi. Same for Morocco Mole wearing a fez or the guy from the Village People wearing a cowboy hat or Michael Jackson wearing a burka.  They're just things, aren't they?"
ABCDesis,320uy0,trctn4238934,11,Fri Apr 10 21:07:57 2015 UTC,I maybe completely off base here but this is my observation. It has something to do with how one perceives the effects of other ethnicities trying out our cultural elements. People who grew in the US seem to think that will somehow lessen/cheapen elements of our culture. People born in India are not as worried. Most of the people who have spoken in support of it on this sub are people born in India.
ABCDesis,320uy0,i_am_not_sam,5,Thu Apr 9 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"Good observation, I agree!"
ABCDesis,320uy0,cowabuNGa_GNarly,2,Thu Apr 9 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear here that ""other ethnicities"" almost exclusively means whites, doesn't it? It might be similarly jarring if an Asian or Black woman wears a bindi, but is it still cultural appropriation?    People who grew in the US seem to think that will somehow lessen/cheapen elements of our culture. People born in India are not as worried.   Will it cheapen our culture?"
ABCDesis,320uy0,trctn4238934,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:25:09 2015 UTC,but is it still cultural appropriation    I don't know. You should ask someone who knows what cultural appropriation is. So far it looks like it means anyone other than Indians wearing/doing our stuff.
ABCDesis,320uy0,tinkthank,2,Thu Apr 9 22:52:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're a little off, but not by much. I agree, the whole Bindi thing is a terrible example.    Most of the people who have spoken in support of it on this sub are people born in India.   I think this is the case because a lot of us [American Desis] grew up with being mocked for being Indian and that outward expression of our culture in any form lead to us being treated ""differently"", mostly in a not so-positive manner. Now that very culture we were mocked for is being taken from us and re-interpreted and diluted of its very ""Indian-ness"". The Bindi is a terrible example of a much larger issue, such as seeing Indian clothing and accessories not getting their due credit. You'll often see Indian styled jewelry with no one thinking its Indian at all. Its one thing to wear it and go ""I like this Sari and I think Indian clothing is really cool!"" as opposed to, ""I think I'll wear a Sari for Halloween"" or even worse, ""I really like this Bohemian Toga [Sari]!"""
ABCDesis,320uy0,yerasickcuntharry,12,Thu Apr 9 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"Simply put when a white girl wears a bindi in the west, she's seen as cool and hip but if a desi girl wears she is seen as unwilling to assimilate and mocked behind her back"
ABCDesis,320uy0,FaFaRog,3,Fri Apr 10 05:07:03 2015 UTC,"I understand the example, but how does the white girl wearing the bindi make the situation worse for the Indian girl? Shouldn't the white girl wearing the bindi make it more acceptable over time?  Also Selena Gomez is probably a great example of appropriation because she had absolutely no idea what she was wearing. When asked what the inspiration of her song was, she said it had a middle eastern vibe, a tribal feel and that she was dressed as an Indian princess. Wtf? If you're going to wear something, shouldn't you at least have read the first line of Wikipedia on what it is and where it came from? Not that she's the first artist to do this."
ABCDesis,320uy0,LotusEyes92,4,Thu Apr 9 21:54:25 2015 UTC,I think people don't like the idea that White people have to like things before something is cool. I think its kind of about power. You're basically handing over power to them and if they deem that something is acceptable then that makes life easier for you.   And ugh don't me started on Selena Gomez. That made me so angry.
ABCDesis,320uy0,FaFaRog,4,Fri Apr 10 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"But in a white majority country, things will only be cool once white people accept them. It may not always be the case, but at the moment it is.   I understand what you mean by acceptability though. In a truly just society there shouldn't be such a stark difference in perception between an Indian girl wearing a bindi and a white girl wearing one, and yet there is."

It doesn't even have to be alienating, it can even be that it is something special that is yours and is precious and that you have with you all the time. When someone else can turn it into a ""thing"", don't you see how it could be hurtful? Which just goes to say that someone adopting a symbol to define them in some way that shows respect for those whom it belongs to doesn't count as appropriation but as appreciation instead."
ABCDesis,320uy0,cowabuNGa_GNarly,7,Fri Apr 10 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you posted this, because you expressed the viewpoint I had even up until a few weeks ago.  Here's what I've learned:  If things are just things, that means the meaning of those things are assigned to them by people, right?  But here's the key issue with appropriation: who gets to do the assigning?  Because whoever has the ""final word"" on what things mean literally gets to define reality.  That's kind of a big deal, isn't it?  Yes, the bindi being appropriated may not in itself seem like serious business...but wearing a bindi without even caring about its original cultural meaning and then getting away with it without anyone questioning it reveals a power dynamic...and power is serious business.    If you just get stuck on the bindi example, you're missing the forest for the trees.  Maybe the bindi won't turn out to be a big deal...on the other hand, it can be a sign of more things to come: of more and more Desi culture being taken without any respect to its roots.  Yoga is another thing that we could debate about being appropriated.  So some people who study or follow cultural issues more carefully than I ever did are asking: ""What's next?  We've seen this pattern before (see ""Orientalism"")...""  Basically what I've come to understand is that what I originally took to be no big deal is what people more sensitive to these issues see as warning signs for bigger problems.  I used to think that they were exaggerating, but I now see that their fundamental concern is sound: better to sound an alarm too early than too late."

So if cultural appropriation continues, what's next? What are the bigger problems?"
ABCDesis,320uy0,tinkthank,9,Thu Apr 9 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Well take yoga, for example.  Yoga in its original context is a spiritual path.  And when it first came to the U.S., that context was mostly maintained.  But gradually it started becoming marketed and sold as an exercise fad rather than a spiritual path.  As you can probably tell from not only this sub but news stories in the media, the battle is now underway to determine who gets to say what yoga actually is.  The problem is that, while yoga of course belongs to all of humanity, the culture which practiced and perfected it for centuries is somehow on the defense in this battle.  Why should such be the case?  How does a country which only seriously started having yoga studios for a few decades suddenly have the upper hand over a country that's had them for centuries?  Ponder it for a moment.  Anyone with even a shred of integrity would not cut out what has always been essential to yoga, its spiritual purpose, and still call it yoga.  But see, it's OK for Americans to do that to an Indian tradition because of course who really cares about their feelings?  And see that's the root of the problem: the inequality of value.  Once you make one group of people's feelings inherently less important than another group's, you've set up the foundation for some really bad mistreatment in many other areas.  Maybe you're not convinced, and that's totally OK; but consider the possibility that at the very least it is legitimate for some people to be somewhat concerned."
ABCDesis,320uy0,frackaracka,4,Thu Apr 9 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"Appropriation has likely occured since the dawn of humanity. People intermingle and share their cultures, and it only makes sense that sometimes people will take what they like. I mean it can range from the British appropriating shampoo to the Germans appropriating the swastika. Cultural exchange is universal and goes both ways.   Yoga is a great example, because it's already been Americanized to an extreme and one could argue it's already become a part of mainstream American culture. But when it comes to who gets to define Yoga, I'm not sure I follow as to why the American definition has more power than the Indian one. Power is not absolute and I'd argue that the inequality you speak of is changing as we speak. As the Indian economy grow and India becomes a more influential player on the world stage, asserting itself on these cultural matters should not be difficult. From a worldly point of view, there's no reason a person from say China could not distinguish between American Yoga and original Indian yoga in the future."
ABCDesis,320uy0,FixinThePlanet,5,Thu Apr 9 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is, its already too late for Yoga. They've already made it into a fad with its own fashion, music, and ""equipment"". Yoga has been a spiritual activity for Indians, which has been taken over by everything it isn't, an exercise void of any spiritual significant which is now replaced by materialism.   The ""battle"" is now against further misappropriations of Indian culture, to at least have some sort of respect and reverence for its origin rather than stripping it completely."

I realized that I was dismissing others' concerns  only because they weren't my concerns, which is pretty selfish and stupid.

ABCDesis,320uy0,FobTurnedCD,9,Fri Apr 10 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"I agree about the ""preaching to the choir"" aspect of these discussions. However I will point out that the anger that usually bubbles up in this sub is not really directed towards white people so much as it is towards other Desis who try to invalidate the feelings of those who feel strongly about cultural appropriation. So with that in mind, you bring up a good discussion topic and I hope that we can all discuss this in a civil manner without insulting others who may feel differently. (And that goes for both people who are for and against cultural appropriation.)  Personally, I remember a time when I was out at brunch with some (non-desi) girlfriends. The waitress who sat us was wearing a bindi. When she left, I asked, ""Did that girl look Indian to you guys?"" When they agreed that she didn't appear to be Indian, I just shook my head and said, ""That's offensive.""  And that was it. That was all that needed to be said. I didn't expound on it, I didn't go into a rant or anything. I just expressed that I was offended and let it be. I've never had a discussion about cultural appropriation with those friends before, but all they needed to see was their Indian friend looking at a white girl wearing a bindi, and they immediately understood. That one girl wearing the bindi is probably a lost cause but the two people I was with directly experienced my point of view. And experiencing that is now part of their worldview.  For what it's worth, I follow fashion blogs and cultural appropriation - of all cultures, not just Desis - is increasingly becoming a concern. Now that minorities especially are emerging as a larger voice in global fashion, that inspiration for seasonal trends is becoming decidedly less one-sided. Instead of designers just taking the shiny parts of each culture and making it a ""trend"", minority designers are influencing fashion too. The end result is art and fashion that is a blended influence of not just a culture, but points of view. And that's a good thing."
ABCDesis,320uy0,FixinThePlanet,6,Thu Apr 9 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. I've never really cared too much about cultural appropriation - I've always considered it more cultural diffusion and a byproduct of our global society. But this statement of yours really helped me understand how minority groups should take ownership of their culture and rather letting it be diluted and regurgitated as the next hip thing, can dictate the history and power of the symbol behind the object/act."

That was wrong of me.  While blending, appropriation, etc. is going to happen in an increasingly globalized culture, I see now that this doesn't mean people must resign themselves to surrendering everything important to them.  There is nothing wrong with asking for cultural exchanges to be done respectfully, and speaking up when that's not the case.  Thanks for sharing your story.  I really liked the way you put this:   the two [non-desi] people I was with directly experienced my point of view.    I think that's the right goal to have in discussions of this nature, to get the other side to experience something as one of us even for a brief moment.  That's very different than trying to intellectually or philosophically ""debate"" the issue, which in my experience doesn't often succeed in changing points of view anyway."
