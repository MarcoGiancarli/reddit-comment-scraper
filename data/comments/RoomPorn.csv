RoomPorn,3e2xaf,zim2411,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:03 2015 UTC,It's just an electric cook top.  It's basically four hot plates in a single unit.  An electric stove is just one of those on top of an oven.
RoomPorn,3e2xaf,MayorMoonbeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:30 2015 UTC,Yes but how is it connected to electricity via that table?
RoomPorn,3e2xaf,zim2411,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"It could be the electric line runs though the table leg and is just next to an outlet in the floor.  Edit: Check out the left leg in this pic: http://www.idesignarch.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Coruna-Apartment_2.jpg  It looks like the right side of that leg is removable. (The line is also visible in this picture) The power cable probably  runs down this leg to an outlet in the floor, and you can remove that part of the leg to unplug it if you need to move the table."
RoomPorn,3e2xaf,kjoeleskapet,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Another very real possibility is that it is not plugged in at all, it doesn't work, and it's just a staged design photo."

There is a lot of money on Lake Gaston, and although the majority of them are not as nice as this example, this is one of hundreds of these ""outdoor lounge"" type setups on the lake here. If mosquitoes were such a problem here, these wouldn't exist the way they do. As someone else said, mosquitoes like still stagnant water - which Lake Gaston is not."

RoomPorn,3di0fc,venom02,2,Fri Jul 17 10:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure unless he means that mosquitos hate moving air. They're small enough and light enough that a good fan will disrupt their attempts to land on you.  I read it and didn't quite believe it until I sat on my front porch in south Alabama with a fan and no other repellent. The only places I got bit were one or two spots on the back parts of my legs that were out of the wind.  With that said, I don't think those two ceiling fans would do much. They might keep the air underneath from getting stagnant and oppressive, but you'd need an industrial-size fan to see any sort of mosquito control."
RoomPorn,3di0fc,sagafood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:31 2015 UTC,It works here in arizona. I can open all my doors and windows and as long as the ceiling fans are on bugs seem to avoid coming inside. I live near a lake so we do have a few bugs in this part of the state.

I live in Florida and have a similar space, but I'm concerned about the yellowish pollen and dust that coats things at certain times of the year down here, so we haven't bought any furniture just yet.  How do they keep something like this clean - especially with white upholstery?"
RoomPorn,3di0fc,charlesml3,4,Thu Jul 16 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"So we get the obligatory ""week of pollen"" every spring.  The trick is to pick your furniture carefully.  You CANNOT just put regular indoor furniture on a dock.  It will get wet sooner or later.    If you have outdoor furniture then it can be cleaned.  That said, I wouldn't pick white, outdoor or otherwise...  For really good outdoor furniture, look at Tropitone.  It is not cheap, but the quality is excellent.  It'll last you for years."
RoomPorn,3di0fc,theshnig,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"This is covered, so white furniture will probably hold up fairly well. The most damaging thing to outdoor furniture I've seen is the mildew, so you gotta make sure you keep cushions dry and store them in a dry spot."
RoomPorn,3di0fc,charlesml3,2,Fri Jul 17 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yep.  When I bought my dock furniture the first thing I told the sales guy was ""NO CUSHIONS!""  They're a giant PITA.

Heh, this actually isn't that uncommon - plenty of unincorporated areas in the US don't have trash service, you just throw your garbage bags in the back of your truck and drive to the dump. It would also be the least of my worries - the main issue with living in a sparsely populated area like this is the things you take for granted...toilet backing up? Car breaks down? Roof leaking? No worries I'll just call the...well, fuck.   Generally with the more remote areas like this, you either have to be dedicated or (in this case) be rich - who cares how long it takes an ambulance to get to you when you can get a medevac helicopter to take you to Stanford, and the more mundane garbage/grocery/etc issues? Pay to make it someone else's problem."

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,fuckinlovecats,68,Mon Jul 13 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'm an electrical engineer. I've had to go do testing on some products in chambers similar to this before. A background on this chamber is that it measures the emitted electromagnetic energy from your product. Also background is that you should know that RF and emissions are in many ways magic. You could guess, estimate, and simulate to get a pretty good idea of what's going to happen, but you could always be blindsided with some weird coupling somewhere, or some other voodoo like that.  By the time your ""prototype"" has made it to this stage, it really isn't a prototype anymore. By this stage, you have deals struck with the vendors, production set up, etc. Everything's pretty much ready to go. Your company just needs the product to get ""X"" certification to be able to actually deliver it to the customer, or start selling it. (X certification could range from FCC to mil-spec to CE mark, to some arbitrary requirement a customer deemed necessary). The way that an ethical engineer would cut costs would be designing to a certain spec, and nothing more than that spec. So in a perfect world, your product would be able to pass spec. We don't live in a perfect world, so the only way to really get up to spec consistently is by overdesigning.  If you've cut costs by going with the lowest bidder for everything, and not setting enough of a margin for error, then you very well might not pass the requirements that you're testing for here. Then it's a big headache figuring out how to patch the problem without affecting the existing deals and production lines. Also, usually you're getting very close to the deadline for having a deliverable. Not passing the tests in this chamber means you have no deliverable. Non-engineering program managers tend to not like that very much."

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,cjhard,6,Mon Jul 13 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"This is really timely. I'm going test a small-run arts and crafts type project for non-intentional radiator FCC compliance in about an hour. Wish me luck; I have no clue what I'm doing.  I'm not an electrical engineer (biological engineer) but I can follow design rules. The stuff for ECM is definitely voodoo. It seems like there is no way to know if you'll pass until you go test the damned thing. In my case, testing is going to double my R&D costs and a failure means having to rebuild my PCBs. I'm nervous."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,bluesunit,16,Mon Jul 13 10:15:44 2015 UTC,"Good luck man! Here's a few tips that I found helpful:   Always get an ambient scan before running your actual test. That way you could make sure the lab equipment is working properly. Also there will be less errors during the actual testing, cutting down on hours billed by the test lab. Copper tape EVERYWHERE. When in doubt, throw a bit of copper tape over it. Any hole no matter how small gets covered. Terminate all your connections! If you have extra ports on your device (USB, ethernet, serial, etc.) Throw some kind of termination on them! Don't just leave them dangling. Make sure there's no holes in your device. You can't just throw copper tape over the holes, so if you notice any holes either fill it in with a screw or quickly get a case made that doesn't have those holes.   With that said... You never really know what's going to happen. Good luck! At $1k-$3k a day (not including expenses on your end) there's certainly no pressure at all ;)"

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,warm_sweater,6,Mon Jul 13 14:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's because they find that the RF and/or audio emissions of the hardware don't meet the project specs, thus requiring additional design iterations until it does."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,firstness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:27 2015 UTC,"At the time I was a firmware tester in Dev (all firmware updates passed through me before we handed it over to QA), and I didn't spend more than one or two trips in that room, so /u/tenbang above me can better answer your question.  The way it was explained to me is sometimes to cut costs, engineers would decide we could get away with having a few less Ferrite beads here, or skimp on the shielding there, etc, and they just cross their fingers that they've done bare minimum to meet the bare minimum specs for RF and emissions testing.  I honestly don't believe all our engineers are so unscrupulous, it's more likely these things get cut by management, or someone pressured someone else to reduce pennies per part to save the team's budget, but those omissions will resolve themselves for 2x the cost when it comes time to test emissions.

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,thiswaythat2,4,Mon Jul 13 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds right, I used to work in these types of rooms. It's not painful... It's just very very unpleasantly creepy. You talk and you only hear your voice through your skull, or the other person's voice only from their mouths, you don't realize how much reflection you hear until it's not there.   You'd think that would be just like being outside, but it's not, it's also completely silent. Your brain interprets that as pressure in your ears, which multiplies the unpleasantness."

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,what_comes_after_q,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying anything about anechoic chambers, I've never been in one so I don't know- but nevertheless I have a feeling that they're quite a bit different than a cave. Caves are typically severely lacking in foam covered walls that absorb echoes... cave walls echo like mad.  So it'd be different and maybe not the best comparison. Maybe a quiet study room in a library or something, I dunno. Just not a cave."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,thiswaythat2,0,Mon Jul 13 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"A small cave is much like a library, and usually quieter. There is no hum of AC units or buzz of fluorescent bulbs in a cave. Sit still in one. They are very quiet. It's pretty similar to an anechoic chamber."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,what_comes_after_q,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Heheh.... Okay, dude. Are caves quiet?  Yes of course they are- especially when there aren't animals scurrying around or drops of water dripping down from the ceiling or whatever, I can agree with you on that point.  I'm just saying... In terms of sound absorption, a cave would be on the other end of the spectrum when compared to an anechoic chamber... because it would echo a LOT against the stone walls.  Can we pretty please agree on that and call it a day?  :P"
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,thiswaythat2,3,Mon Jul 13 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"I used to work in a sound room of an auditorium which had one of these kind of walls in the back to prevent sound from rebounding into the auditorium.  If you stood within about 6 inches of it, it felt like there was an invisible presence smothering half your face.  It's more than just being quiet, it's like going deaf in one ear.  I doubt I'd go crazy being in a room completely enveloped in it, but it would not be a comfortable experience."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,fr0stbyte124,8,Mon Jul 13 12:09:38 2015 UTC,"I've been in one of these, the trippiest thing was not being able to hear my mate talking from 10 metres away."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,runamuckalot,18,Mon Jul 13 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. Sound still travels in the air, so how could that work. It just doesn't Echo."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,Isord,28,Mon Jul 13 03:29:10 2015 UTC,"I exaggerated a little, I could hear him very faintly.   The only sound waves that make it to your ears in an anechoic chamber are the ones that travel directly to your ears, which is a very very small percentage of the sound that is actually created - Sound travels out from your mouth in all directions, and we are used to it bouncing off objects and surfaces, in the chamber there is no sounds bouncing off anything so a huge percentage of what we normally hear is absorbed."
RoomPorn,3d2qnr,runamuckalot,4,Mon Jul 13 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"An odd example of this is an open field with nothing to bounce off of , a person speaking to you at a distance would be much quieter than in a room at a simmilar distance, light and sound sometimes behave similarly and I do light. People freak out  when their flashlight can light up a room  but provide less than adequate light out in the field.  Waves need to bounce Like Nicki Minajs twerking butt"

RoomPorn,3d2qnr,genitaliban,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:58:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go as far as to say they make you go insane. But they can be unsettling.  You'd be surprised how much your subconscious hearing factors into your perception of the world. For instance you know that a large empty room will likely echo while a room full of things does not.  But sound actually factors into your own awareness of where you are in relation to things. Think of it as a really weak version of a bat's echolocation.  Now imagine a room that absorbs all sounds. The sounds you make don't echo so they don't give your brain any information on your surroundings. Your voice suddenly sounds tiny because it's no longer echoing back into your ears. The utter silence makes you uncomfortably aware of the sounds your own body is making, you hear the blood in your ears and the breath in your chest.  I get a little dizzy just standing in there and there's an undefinable discomfort and accompanying feeling of relief when you leave the chamber."

Either some railings are going up, the owner ran out of money and is selling it as-is, or they built it without a permit.

Doesn't seem to be anything dinky about the property to me, though the location doesn't look too special. Its a super unique and expensive property, so thats my guess why its taking so long to sell. I'm guessing the main thing that justifies the 650k asking price to the seller is probably the fact that they spent that much or more constructing those buildings. It cannot be cheap to get someone to build a geodesic dome."

RoomPorn,3cxi7w,isestrex,33,Sat Jul 11 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think a better way to get kids interested in books is to have them read modern books meant for them. Classics are fine when you're an adult, but honestly, who gives a crap about historical novels when they're 5 or 6? On top of that, the odd language use from those times will mess with the kid's head.  Relevant XKCD illustrating my point: https://xkcd.com/988/"
RoomPorn,3cxi7w,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,8,Sat Jul 11 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"While I largely agree with most of this, there is the argument that classics are designated as such for a good reason: they are very well written. One of the pitfalls you can get into when trying to read modern literature to children is that the majority of it just isn't as polished and adroit as the tried and true. Obviously there are diamonds in the rough, and it's not impossible to find a skillfully written work that is entertaining to children in today's new releases, but sadly those books are fewer and farther between. The great thing about the classics is that you KNOW they can deliver as they have for generations."
RoomPorn,3cxi7w,Narrative_Causality,7,Sun Jul 12 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Odd language will mess with a kid's head?   I think you give kids too little credit for what they are able to handle and enjoy. The Little House Books are incredibly entertaining and I definitely connected to the characters, and I also learned about a time and way of living that was so different from my own. My Samantha doll had books that described child worker conditions in the victorian age.  Kids need to be exposed to history and to life outside of their own bubble early on. It's a perfect time to teach kids that people spoke differently, acted differently, and yet many other things are very similar.  The earlier you can teach them to enjoy reading and learning about many different topics the easier it is for them to apply themselves later on."
RoomPorn,3cxi7w,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,0,Sun Jul 12 01:39:54 2015 UTC,"My Samantha doll had books that described child worker conditions in the victorian age. Kids need to be exposed to history and to life outside of their own bubble early on.    This is precisely why kids don't like reading; it's all boring stuff.  Edit:    Odd language will mess with a kid's head?    An excerpt from Huckleberry Finn, as an example.   We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All the boys did.  We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs ""ingots,"" and he called the turnips and stuff ""julery,"" and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked.  But I couldn't see no profit in it.    NO ONE talks like that anymore. Even as an adult, I have to pick apart what he's trying to say(what does hived even mean?). Even if a kid were to enjoy a classic book, the language is so outdated the kid isn't going to even know what's being said half the time. Think how incomprehensible Shakespeare is without a guide, and then multiply that by ten for a kid who is still learning language."
RoomPorn,3cxi7w,VikingHedgehog,9,Sun Jul 12 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how my example (granted anecdotal) about enjoying books set in other times as a child proves your point that kids don't like that sort of thing?   Science fiction has weird words that no one uses, takes place in strange worlds, and talks about things that kids will never deal with in their lives ever. Yet those are also well liked by a lot of kids.  Harry Potter will soon be old, will it also become unreadable simply because someone was born 30 years after it came out?  A mom did a lesson on Shakespeare when I was in 3rd grade and we loved it. I went and saw Mel Gibson's Hamlet that year and loved it. I may not have picked up on even half of what I could when I reread shakespeare in highschool, but that's not the point. The point is to get kids comfortable with it, make it not so strange. Then when they really study it they will be more prepared than a kid who was purposefully not introduced."

All of them date from the 30's or earlier. I was a kid in the 90's. I liked them because they took me to another time, another place.   I'm going to have to say that this is something that is going to vary from child to child, person to person. Because I just plain didn't enjoy most of the kids books that were current for my time. Well, the Goosebumps books were okay. But that's it. All the other typically 90's kids books just plain didnt interest me at all.

It just miffs me that people revere classics so much when there's modern classic being made every day and would be far, far more appropriate to the children of today than a book severely outdated.  It's like parents who force their kids to play old NES games: They're making their kids relive their own past instead of letting their kids have their own, which alienates them from their peers when all they know about Mario and Kirby for the SNES is useless when everyone else at school is talking about the newest Pokemon game.

RoomPorn,3couv0,mankyd,7,Thu Jul 9 21:31:55 2015 UTC,Questions about the tress:  1) Is having so little space around their trunk a problem for the tree?  2) Is having so little space around their trunk a problem for the concrete? https://lancaster.unl.edu/hort/images/plants/treesidewalkx450.jpg
RoomPorn,3couv0,captianinsano,3,Thu Jul 9 18:14:32 2015 UTC,You just sell the house before the trees get that big. Then its the next guys problem.
RoomPorn,3couv0,notreallyswiss,3,Thu Jul 9 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell what kind of tree it is.  The architect's site describes it as ""willowy"" but it is definitely not a willow, which would be a terrible choice anyway because they are messy, need tons of water and are generally short lived.  The leaves look to be some sort of magnoliacaea which might do better in this situation - some cultivars don't mind being in large containers for example and many of the magnolia family do not get overly large.  The canopies on all of the trees are sparse though, which leads me to think they might not be reaaly happy there.    As to the trunk vs paving issue, that might be permeable paving.  And if the tree is of a type that stays small-ish and doesnt form large shallow feeder roots, it won't bother the paving either.  Lots of trees do well in urban conditions where they have limited access to nutrients and water - cities are full of street trees after all.  Strangely enough, it is frequently trees that don't mind being submerged in water periodically that often make good street trees because they are used to thriving without oxygen - a serious problem for many trees under pavement."

Also the ocean is freezing cold and the beach is always windy. The redwoods are creepily quiet and there's nothing interesting about vineyards unless you drink wine. The drive to SF is only an hour usually but driving through the city is so miserable that it was hardly worth it. Northern California is amazingly beautiful if you can take advantage of it.  I have never heard of Web 2.0 but congrats on a good job! I had to move because I couldn't get anything better than retail work.

That is indeed true. But seeing the redwoods as ""creepily"" quiet?? What is it you do for fun where you live now that doesn't include nature or driving through a city?

RoomPorn,3cf7rs,A_frakkin_Cylon,2,Tue Jul 7 21:49:35 2015 UTC,I don't need to fall off a cliff into the freezing waters near bodega bay thanks. But going to the ocean really was all we could think to do since we weren't hikers and didnt want to spend ridiculous money in downtown Santa Rosa or Petaluma. I've spent 100s of hours staring off into that cold ocean during freezing winds. The drive for me was about 30 minutes to the ocean. The roads are windy.

I suspect close to no one has a clue how much goes into coordinating all the little parts and dimensions to get a stair like that to lay out properly.  You managed to get the handrail on the ""inside"" of the spiral to flow without any odd jogs, which is a bitch.  For my own taste it's a bit too ""70s"" and ""commercial"" for a residence like that, but that's just taste.  Overall, you and the team you worked with (including who ever fabricated and installed the stair) look to have nailed it.  edit: I'll bet a lot of folks would be interested in seeing how the steel frame went in, including the cantilever, then was clad and the installation of the glass."
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,5,Mon Jul 6 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"tThanks for the kind words, the handrail relationship to the stairs is always a lot of work.  Having a smooth transition on the right side walking up where the stair turns 180 is always a challenge.  These stairs where tricky since it's an all glass balustrade we could not fudge it.

RoomPorn,3can7u,dicksmithpenishammer,2,Tue Jul 7 11:56:41 2015 UTC,I just designed a stair that's similar to the one you did although it uses a 10x6x1/2 stringer in the center of the stair. The steel fabricator was insisting that the tube wasn't big enough and was wanting to essentially use a 10x6 ingot as a stringer instead. It's a slight vindication to see you made 5x7 tubes work.
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,2,Mon Jul 6 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"!!!I am not an engineer!!! worked in the business long enough to know what usually passes engineering!!! when in doubt get an engineer to do calculations for you!!!  Well it is two 5x7x1/2"" thick tubes that were not noched.  If your stairs are straight and long and you're cutting into the tube you could get some bounce when walking on the stairs.. It all depends how long the stairs are and how much you're cutting into the material.  10""x6"" ingot seems over kill, I would propose two 1"" x 10"" steel plates sandwiched together.  You could even put in 1/2"" white oak in between the two plates for an accent."
RoomPorn,3can7u,dicksmithpenishammer,2,Mon Jul 6 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's a very beautiful stair, us calculator jockies enjoy the challenges you guys throw at us. The ingot idea was very much overkill. It got quite the chuckle around our office."

RoomPorn,3can7u,Pollux37,0,Wed Jul 8 17:56:25 2015 UTC,How is the douglas fir attached to the steel beam? Glue?
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,20,Mon Jul 6 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"There is 1/2"" plywood screwed to the beams and the douglas fir is glued to the plywood.  The Treads are solid wood routed out and screwed in from the underside which is a steel plate."
RoomPorn,3can7u,Pollux37,-10,Mon Jul 6 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"ah, kind of disappointing, but non the less visually impressive. How is that railing attached to the glass? more glue? or is the tempered glass pre drilled for through bolts?"
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,5,Mon Jul 6 15:32:19 2015 UTC,The glass was pre-drilled before tempering all the brackets are custom made out of stainless so fit the railing which is a tilted oval.
RoomPorn,3can7u,Pollux37,2,Mon Jul 6 17:18:00 2015 UTC,and the glass is siliconed in the groove where the fir overlaps the ply wood?
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,3,Mon Jul 6 17:45:17 2015 UTC,"detail link shows how it was done.  The glass sits in an aluminum shoe with a plastic spacer.  It's cemented into the shoe from the sides.  1/8"" space is left in the wood cladding on both sides so that when the wood expands and contracts it won't crack; the space was filled with a soft rubber.  The side caps where glued on the Al shoe and bisketed to the bottom face of the cladding.  Some wood blocking around the gaps was added as well."
RoomPorn,3can7u,Pollux37,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool stuff. I guess that glass is thick enough where the banisters wouldn't wobble if you go down the stairs. For some reason I just imagine little kids running and jumping down the stairs running into the glass walls."
RoomPorn,3can7u,ZiniZini,2,Mon Jul 6 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"The glass is 3/4"" thick starphire ultra clear glass it's ridiculously strong.  Unless you hit it with something harder than the glass it is unlikely to brake.  kids skull = softer than the glass.. shit happens but it's highly unlikely."

And maybe do some layered fabric draping on the ceiling and walls to give it a little more softness instead of the harsh white.

RoomPorn,3bzmzq,Meunderwears,43,Fri Jul 3 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not trying to be a dick here, just actually curious.   Is there a way to measure luxury? Like is there some sort of luxury score that various hotels around the world are scored on? If there is, it would be super interesting to see how its calculated."
RoomPorn,3bzmzq,MrTacoMan,38,Fri Jul 3 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"Hotel rankings depend mostly on location, service and decor. Most importantly service. The most luxurious hotels in the world must be able to accommodate the demands of the most discerning clientele. These include things like maintaining impeccable, twice a day housekeeping; making dinner reservations at popular restaurants on a moments notice; providing services like a world-class spa; and (most importantly) maintaining a smile and hospitable decorum even when guests are rude or unreasonable. Many of the ""most luxurious"" hotels in the world, like Le Meurice, have been in business for hundreds of years, and have thus perfected every facet of their many services and customer relationships.   Decor is also important to a hotel's ""luxury ranking,"" illustrated in OP's photo. Most of the ""best"" hotels in the world are appointed with expensive furniture, rare antiques, renovated bathrooms, and even world-class art. However, decor is always second to service. Many ""best"" hotels (particularly in Europe) have not been recently renovated. However, they are impeccably clean, meticulously maintained and often classically decorated (thus eliminating the need to frequently redecorate). That, combined with the aforementioned ""luxury"" service, is enough to keep a hotel at the top. On the other hand, many three or four star ""design hotels"" offer brand-new, high-end decor, but lack the service that the most pampered guests demand.  For example, a four star hotel in the center of paris may be located a few blocks from the Louvre and provide you with a new, sleek room for a fairly high but competitive price upon check-in. However, hotels like Le Meurice (which is located literally across the street from the Louvre) will greet you on the street before check-in with a number of bellhops, hand you a welcome drink, provide you with a free room upgrade, and leave you a welcome gift in your upgraded room such as fresh fruits or local pastries. Like most other competing businesses that provide more-or-less the same services, hotels distinguish themselves through the little details.  Hotel rankings are scored mostly on how hotels meet the common standards of demanding guests and, essentially, how well they treat their customers. Publications like Travel and Leisure, Conde Nast Traveller and Forbes rank hotels using their own criteria intended to reflect these standards. Consumers have recently been able to voice their own opinions through sites such as Trip Advisor, which allows a more in-depth analysis of how well each hotel fulfills each guests' demands. All of these rankings are generally consistent with one another, and are amalgamated to distinguish which hotels are ""the best""."
RoomPorn,3bzmzq,yaboydt,16,Sat Jul 4 03:05:27 2015 UTC,"I would guess (and this is only a guess) that most luxurious is a quick way of referring to the amenities, the expense of materials, etc. As open to personal interpretation as the word is luxury I think in this context it's shorthand for fancy as fuck."

RoomPorn,3bzmzq,Nastapoka,5,Sat Jul 4 06:58:48 2015 UTC,"Well you can use a few :   Number of stars, which highly varies from country to country Price, which also varies ; a costly hotel in Japan might not be excellent, mainly because everything is expensive there Known guests ; if a place is frequented by ambassadors / princes etc. it might be a good clue of its being considered a ""luxurious"" place   In the end, I think it depends on what you consider luxury to be about. Is it about good service ? Expensive products ? Beautiful things (which is itself a highly subjective point) ? People you meet ? What it cost to be made ?"
RoomPorn,3bzmzq,OB1_kenobi,0,Fri Jul 3 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps luxury, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.

RoomPorn,3c0dv8,Asherhul,4,Sat Jul 4 11:10:59 2015 UTC,"As an American who hasn't had the opportunity to travel, what exactly is a hostel and how does it work?"
RoomPorn,3c0dv8,FoxtrotZero,5,Sat Jul 4 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"Fellow American here who stayed in this hostel. Hostels typically are renting a bed, for very cheap (like $30-40 a night, from what I've experienced). You can choose from sleeping in a pricier room with less people, or something like a 10 person dorm room for cheaper.  In hostels, you share a bathroom, shower, and kitchen. Often people in hostels will buy food to cook, instead of going out to eat every night. It helps in Iceland, as some of the hostels are about an hour away from the nearest town.  So basically, hostels are cheap, but you sacrifice privacy. If you don't mind all of those aspects, it's a great way to budget travel."

As evidence this list shows the most expensive homes for sale in the US. You will see most are the archetypal megamansion or penthouse, not single-floor houses.   That said, I think single-floor homes have experienced somewhat of a renaissance. The single-story ""ranch house"" was very popular in California in the 50s and 60s and has experienced a significant come-back. Single story homes like the one pictured allow for more indoor-outdoor flow which has become increasingly valued over the last decade.   Additionally, gaudy mansions such as Spelling Manor or other mega-mansions have increasingly become seen as tacky in the post-recession environment. One-story eco-mansions give millionaires and billionaires a way to feel good about themselves while still living in trend-setting homes."

I'm sure many happy hours are commemorated there, but is it roomporn? It's sure not speeding up this grandma's rocking chair much, other than to answer the question I've always had, ""Who buys all those Hobby Lobby plaques anyway?"" but YMMV.  I'm guessing the beams and wainscoting are plastic stick-on? Apologies if they aren't.  When I was 15, my family moved into an 1867 Midwestern farmhouse that had Colonial plastic stick-on beams, Colonial spindles on the stairwell, Colonial fake-candles chandelier in the eat-in kitchen, and Colonial maple staining on the Victorian woodwork, all conscientiously applied by a house-flipping remodeler. God knows what he was thinking. My mother found a Victorian rose glass window in the front parlor, for some reason overlooked by Mister Colonial, and made it the centerpiece of her restoration-to-some-semblance-of-Victoriana."

Most of the time they go out afterwards.  Gets everyone looking forward to getting work done, plus it incentivizes people to deal with non-trivial stuff during the week, leaving the easy stuff for the queue bust so they can leave earlier."

If I look at a companies website and don't see the mention of happy hours or a bar, it makes me wonder about the company culture. We technically don't call ours a bar because that would look unprofessional but people know what it is at first glance.   However my company doesn't have a gym which is embarrassing for our size as an agency. I feel like those are way more common than bars. And from the outside eye it could look like we don't care about health. (We do have fitness reimbursement, a in company gym would be more to brag about to potential employees.)"

And then it became 60-70 each week. Like nah, thats dumb, that place had amazing perks but it was sucking away my life.   So far for the company I'm with now I've had to work a couple weekends here and there but usually clock in 40-45 on an average week. Some weeks might be more but some weeks are less so it well than makes up for it. Plus the people are way friendlier and understanding.   And I'm a front-end web developer if anyone is wondering."

A house in the middle of nowhere with three bedrooms will run you right around 650'000 CHF. This house is probably more around 4.5 mill CHF, if its in one of the lower taxed kantons it'll be worth much more. The key here is a.) location, anywhere on a lake like the vierwaldstaedtersee will run you millions, and then b.) tax, the marginal tax rate for kantons like zug is a good three percent lower than say Luzern, which in the income bracket above 1 mill CHF per year is a boatload of money, so houses in low tax bracket kantons will costs considerably more"

The appliance is not meant to be wedged into cabinetry and needs room on each side for ventilation. That view of the unfinished plywood in the interior if the island is awful!!

If you are ever mixing things on that counter and something spills, whoever is sitting on that couch is going to be covered.

We actually like that opening, though. I normally don't like open floor plans, as they reduce the privacy people have in different rooms, but the house has so many other places to go and ways to get away from each other that I like it in the kitchen/dining room/living room. It will let us see the TV when we're in the kitchen and, when we have kids, to see what they're up to."

Seriously, the gaps between the boards betray it (am I right, this can't be laminate?) and why is it in the kitchen?  Oh yeah, and everything else all the kitchen folk below (or above) have mentioned."
RoomPorn,3azy5g,GiggleGiggleTeeHee,9,Thu Jun 25 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"What is wrong with the floor? I personally loooove old original hardwood. My last apartment was built in the late 19th century with the original hardwood and crowne moulding, and all the imperfections were beautiful. So much history. Hell, one time I noticed a tiny piece of paper sticking up from a gap in the floor. Yanked it out and it was the label from a men's shaving product from 1920-something.  Also almost every place I've lived in, regardless of the year it was built, has had hardwood in the kitchen. I'd much rather see that than ceramic tile or w/e.   I agree the kitchen isn't perfect, but all around this house has so much more character than the typical soulless new-construction ever will. You get the warm cozy feeling that there is a real family living here."

They said it was just so tacky and wondered why people don't just buy in an affordable price range. What is the point of an impressive but empty house?

RoomPorn,3aia3c,pylamb,28,Sat Jun 20 13:11:26 2015 UTC,I really like the look of the wool walls but wouldnt that make the room super hot... and flamable?
RoomPorn,3aia3c,punkrawkintrev,98,Sat Jun 20 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Common misconceptions actually, on both counts!   Wool is a pretty good thermal insulator, which is something that cuts both ways. If you're really hot, and then you go put on several layers of wool, you're not going to lose heat well and will roast yourself alive. But, it's not a material that makes stuff hot; it slows transfer of heat. And that also means it would take a while to heat up a room from the outside; if the starting point was a relatively cool room, the cooler air trapped in the wool would take longer to heat up and keep the room cooler for longer.  As for flammability, it burns at a relatively high temperature, tends to smoulder before burning and is quite difficult to keep it burning; the by-product of burnt wool actually puts out most fires. To burn wool you have to keep burning it, whereas if you dropped a match on it you might get a bit of a smoulder and then it would just go out. This is why wool is commonly used for carpets and sofas; it's a great fire retardant.  tl;dr wool is fucking magic"
RoomPorn,3aia3c,les_rosbif,5,Sat Jun 20 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"I deal with wool every day and manufacture custom dyed wool for projects like this.  For indoor applications fire code requires it to meet E84 fire testing. All the wool I have sent out to be tested passed as a Class A.  Its self extinguishing so it won't just burn on its own.  As soon as the flame is moved away, it goes out on its own. The other person answered your other question pretty well in that its its effectively insulation so it will actually help keep the room to whatever temp you have it set for.  Its also great for sound reduction.  A lot of people use it in office projects because of this."

RoomPorn,3a5qte,unnaturalpenis,34,Wed Jun 17 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're making a pun (darkrooms need blacklights) but if you aren't, darkrooms use what are called safelights which are generally any shade from amber to deep red. The reason is that black and white printing paper is only sensitive to blue and green light, so the red light won't expose the paper before you develop the print."

RoomPorn,3a5qte,manfly,21,Wed Jun 17 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"As a photographer, I do not understand why this room is white. Safelights are not perfect and it would be in your best interests to minimize illumination to just what's absolutely necessary to work when printing. Then there's going to be absurd amounts of bounce going on in the room when the enlarger is turned on, fogging up any paper in the room or prints that haven't been fixed yet. This is pretty awfully designed."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,mioko,11,Wed Jun 17 16:50:03 2015 UTC,That sink only has room for one tray.... you couldn't actually do any printing - lol
RoomPorn,3a5qte,menkar,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:42:04 2015 UTC,That's the rinsing tray. Developer and fixer trays wouldn't be in a sink.
RoomPorn,3a5qte,mioko,8,Wed Jun 17 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Yes they should be in a sink. All trays should be in one long sink. The rinse trays at the end, with water spilling out. That water will hit the other trays keeping all the chem at the same temperature.   Something like this. http://www.studioindiana.com/Resources/smtrays1a.jpeg  Where else would the dev/stop/fix trays go? On the counter? That would just get chem all over the place. I don't think I've ever been in a darkroom where all the trays weren't in one sink."

Yes, in an ideal world that would be the case & as such is what you will find in any 'pro' darkroom. But not all darkrooms are made/used by pros.  Myself & the building manager were perplexed when the contractors presented us with a white painted darkroom though...."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,cjdavies,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:31:31 2015 UTC,Myself & the other users of this darkroom handle it just fine.   If you took a black light in there you'd find that there's dried fixer/dev all over the place. Using a sink helps prevent this.   Most people have a very caviller attitude towards B&W chemistry. Like it's completely harmless stuff. I personally treat it with lots of respect.
RoomPorn,3a5qte,menkar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"If you took a black light in there you'd find that there's dried fixer/dev all over the place.    I doubt it, as we actually clean up after ourselves. Only takes a minute to spray & wipe down the work surface & wall tiles."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,cjdavies,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to start a fight or be mean - But I have zero doubt that there's dried chem on ever surface in that room.   Spraying & Wiping down are okay, but you'll never get all of it. It then dries into an incredibly fine crystal like dust, and gets in the air. Hence why a sink is the best practice.   I managed a very large photo lab for years. It was so hard to get people to follow simple procedure like ""Please keep the chem in sinks"". I would take a black light and shine it on the walls and floors to show all the noobs just how much chem they were tracking around. You'd find it several rooms away, like in the lunch room. All over the fridge, coffee machines, ect, ect.   Shurg"
RoomPorn,3a5qte,menkar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're overestimating the dangers of darkroom chemistry, especially for a darkroom that is almost exclusively used for b&w work & certainly doesn't get used for anything like toning with cyanotypes. Sure, there is probably crap between the tiles & along the corners of the wall. But does it cause any danger whatsoever to the people that use the room? Almost certainly not. Even if the 'crystal like dust' did pose a danger in the air, the whole air in the room is recycled at least a dozen times an hour thanks to a properly spec'd ventilation system."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,cjdavies,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're overestimating the dangers of darkroom chemistry   I've met lots of people who've developed rather acute sensitivity to photo chemistry. For some it took upwards of 20 years to see the effects. Some it took no time at all. One friend lost the feeling in her finger tips, and never recovered it. One friends finger nails started breaking and falling off. Knew another person developed a sort of asthma from breathing in too much chem.  My stance is - Why take a chance? Just set it up correctly and do it right from day one."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,menkar,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Should? Ideally? Sure. Need to be? Not at all.  You can develop prints with two cookie sheets and a hose on your garage floor if you wanted to. How difficult is it to not drip developer/fixer all over when you move to rinse?  I'm not about to get into a debate, but I don't believe some trickling rinse water hitting the outside of other plastic/fiberglass trays 6+ feet down the sink very effective at regulating chemical temperature. The air in the room is what's primarily going to dictate your temps."
RoomPorn,3a5qte,mioko,6,Wed Jun 17 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"How difficult is it to not drip developer/fixer all over when you move to rinse?   Here's an interesting fact you probably don't know about. When you drip developer & fix all over the place it dries into a fine white crystal substance. This then gets in the air, which you breath in. Work in a darkroom long enough and this stuff ends up in your lungs. Hence why it's best to keep all chem in a sink that can be cleaned afterwards.   The air in the room is what's primarily going to dictate your temps.   In theory there would be about half an inch of temp controlled water in the sink surrounding the trays, keeping that a constant temp. This is how EVERY PRO lab is set-up.  The reason I bring these things up is that this room appears to been have a ""custom built"" darkroom, but honestly it's just a confused mess. Anyone who knew what they were doing would never have set-up a darkroom like this. It's just amateur hour."

RoomPorn,3a1608,GhostMatter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:16:26 2015 UTC,Would you have any more information about this place?
RoomPorn,3a1608,krisssy,7,Tue Jun 16 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"I did a reverse image search and found this:   The old village house was transformed by the architect Daniela de Oliveira. She created more open spaces while trying to preserve some originals features. The owner of the neighboring hotel Uxua , took care of the decor – it’s his idea to install pieces of aventurine , a common green stone in Bahia, as the pool liner.   Looking up the hotel on Google Maps shows this house on street view on a road to the south of the hotel:  http://i.imgur.com/4noufmZ.png  Which is exactly the same house shown in OP's link:  http://i.imgur.com/T3LNp6r.jpg  And if you view streetview imagery from the adjacent street, this seems to be the 'front' of the property:  http://i.imgur.com/qlsHAul.png  Quite unassuming from the front! I like the fact that it is surrounded by colourful houses and dense greenery.  Edit: Googling the architect's name, and looking on the apparent source website (casa.abril.com.br) finds this URL: http://casa.abril.com.br/materia/casa-de-praia-com-muita-madeira-e-branco-em-trancoso  The description of the property (called Casa de Praia, ""House Beach""), translated from Portuguese:   Frenchman Thierry Moriceau spent much of his life working in the finance industry. But his dream was always to earn enough money to eventually live in a beautiful location.  ""I found this corner on the other side of the world and fell in love with the beauty and freedom of Trancoso"". He purchased the property as a studio from potter João José Calazans and then transformed it.  ""The space was very constricted. There were virtually no windows, and there were two clay ovens"", recalls the architect Daniela de Oliveira. There were triangular louvers on top of the building which she preserved. She also tried to create more openings at different levels separated by stairs.  All work was done by local tradesmen with local materials such as wood and straw paraju.  Dutchman Wilbert Das, neighboring hotel owner Uxua, took care of the decor - and it was his idea to install pieces of aventurine, a common green stone in Bahia, to line the pool.  Leading a simple life in his new paradise, the new resident says with twinkle in his eye: ""I am very happy here.""   Each photo on the source website has an accompanying caption for each photo."

That's true if you're a backpacker peon in Indonesia, but not true when you're staying in a multi-million dollar residence in a developing country.  First, it's pretty high up and many insects can't just fly up that high.  Mosquitoes generally stay under 25 feet.  They also have all sorts of chemical treatments, sprays, powders, and fumigators to kill virtually all insects in that sort of property."

RoomPorn,39kyoz,PianosForTeeth,3,Fri Jun 12 16:29:34 2015 UTC,My family is actually from a small coastal town in Colima called Manzanillo. It is the essence of beauty and oddly enough A LOT of Europeans go there. When I was a kid I met so many different Europeans there and it truly is a memorable experience just to got there. Also the people of Colima do not let people with neighboring states in because the people of Colima are against the whole drug war and want nothing to do with it. People there are truly kind to outsiders and you will just have a great time with the culture there since it is more lax compared to other regions in Mexico.

RoomPorn,394423,darien_gap,4,Wed Jun 10 20:26:21 2015 UTC,The architecture looks like it would hold a lot of potential. However all the furniture looks heavy handed. No particular piece compliments any other piece and as a whole they don't speak to one another. In fact they all seem to repel each other. The blue and white busy pattern of the couch clashes awfully with the brown/pattern in the carpet. And the coffee table looks atrocious in that mix. It seems like the decorator chose pieces they liked individually but did not consider how they would work together. Every piece seems to compete for attention. Its like a room full of egotistical actors all trying to steal center stage.

At least it takes the focus away from the drawn man butt next to the mirror though. Maybe the lights are intentionally grotesque for that reason.

RoomPorn,38t1uo,warinthestars,3,Sat Jun 6 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"While you are mostly right, fresnel lenses are actually different from (though very similar to) step lenses. Fresnel lenses remove the convex (rounded) side of the lenses in a step pattern. Step lenses remove the plano (flat) side of the lens. In both cases this is done to eliminate loss of light through the lens (less glass to shine through, less light loss) but the end results are different, with the fresnel lens offering a nice soft beam of light, and the step lens allowing for sharp focusing and shaping of the light. Step lenses are very seldom used now days as advances in lens technology have made light loss through a standard lens negligible. The step lenses also had a drawback, where faint afterimages of the steps could be seen in the beam, creating a slight bullseye pattern."

Some of that brick texture doesn't even make sense.   Look at the pipes. See that dark spot on the bottom pipe on the straight piece with the series of scratches that looks vaguely like an A beside it? See the exact same dark spot and series of scratches repeated twice more on that same piece of pipe? Same with the top pipe, only a different dark spot, and different scratches that are further away from it. But still repeated.   Also, see above those dark spots on both pipes and how they just sorta stop because there's a seam where the texture begins and ends?

I think 2 pieces of stainless steel, 6 millimetres thick, should be made slightly larger than the thickness and height of the pipes, with holes for the pipes, then neatly cut down the length. Place each set at the perpendicular of the pipes on their respective angles.  Say the pipes go East along the Northern-most wall at the left of the photo, then hang a right to travel South. Put one set of steel on the Southern-most point before the pipe curves to the East, then another set of steel on the Western-most point of the Eastern-heading pipes.  In these places, but obviously perpendicular to the pipes, unlike my shitty paint job.  The two halves of the steel doesn't even have to be connected to anything aside from each other but just reach down to the floor, maybe with a 2mm thick piece of nylon, ertacetal, or UHMW plastic on the very bottom to prevent scuffing."

Based on the link that /u/Meunderwears posted below (linky link) and the fact that it's in Shoreditch, a seriously trendy/hipster area of the city, and spread over three floors, I would be absolutely shocked if that place came in under a million quid. I'd guess closer to £1.5m, probably."
RoomPorn,382pp9,PrometheusTitan,22,Mon Jun 1 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on London house prices but based on what little I know from the million and one house buying shows it seems like 1.5 million would be a bargain for that place.

RoomPorn,382pp9,CrispierDuck,8,Mon Jun 1 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"Probably true. I'm nowhere near the property ladder here, so am used to shared rental places. I have a pretty good sense of what flats cost up to about £400K. Above that, my radar kind of lumps them into ""stupid money"" level."

RoomPorn,382pp9,burntoast333,4,Tue Jun 2 06:08:25 2015 UTC,A full house done up to that spec in Shoreditch? Try £3.5m
RoomPorn,382pp9,p-wing,3,Mon Jun 1 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd think it is a lot more than £1.5 mil.  Here is an example, This is a 2 bed flat going for £1.1mil in Camden."

The cost of living absolutely sucks. So much. But I love having the world at my doorstep. Some of the best restaurants in the world are in London (with cuisines from all around the world). Some of the best entertainment, nightlife, travel opportunities, etc.  I also can buy pretty much anything I need/want and have it delivered to my door next day. Or order delivery from nearly 200 places from my phone. I've got good public transport that takes me anywhere in the city for cheap. I have a choice of about three dozen broadband provides and about as many mobile phone companies.  I like the peace and tranquillity of the more rural settings, but the practicality of it, and the lack of ""there's always something going on"" would not do good things for me over time."

RoomPorn,382pp9,VernonDent,8,Mon Jun 1 15:41:05 2015 UTC,You don't need the ceiling fan for cooling the room; you need it for circulating the heated air that rises to the top of that very high ceiling.

But they all make a noticable difference, even in the winter.  Our ceilings aren't even very high, but if you stand and raise your arms you can tell it's noticably warmer closer to the ceiling without them on.  Ceiling fans have a winter setting which makes them rotate counter-clockwise and push the hot air back down toward the ground.  It seems to help."

RoomPorn,37ybnn,brawr,24,Sun May 31 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"I think the traditional concept of flag sanctity is on its way out. In the modern era of branding with bright colors and eye catching patterns, national flags are the ultimate brand symbol. And there isn't much of a taboo on where branding can/can't be used. Clothes, decorations, food are all fair game. Toilet paper is the only exception that comes to mind.  So yes there's a flag carpet... but that's okay.  edit: hey y'all, don't downvote because you disagree, downvote if the poster is adding nothing to the discussion. /u/SkepticalJohn and /u/Meziroth are both entitled to their opinions too.

The world is changing, and people's tastes change with it.   There's no problem with patterns and designs which resemble the American flag, IMO. But when you actually lay flag on the ground to be used as a rug, I get a bit irritated.   It's like comparing the tiny American flags they hand out on the Fourth of July to a real flag. Does it represent the flag? Yes. Is it actually the flag? No, which is why it's okay to throw those little flags away once the fireworks are over.   Disclaimer, I can't actually see the rug in question (mobile issues) I'm just going off context here. I'm assuming the rug design somewhat resembles what is on the throw pillows? Correct me if I'm wrong."
RoomPorn,37ybnn,SkepticalJohn,2,Mon Jun 1 06:33:08 2015 UTC,"You're right, and that's a good point. It's not the flag, it's a representation of the flag.

RoomPorn,37q1ti,DBallR,16,Fri May 29 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"I've been in a Google datacenter before and the employees there had bikes because the floor was quite large with rows upon rows upon rows of racks of equipment. Think like the inside of a Super Wal-Mart. The datacenter jockeys would receive a work order about a failed piece of equipment (I imagine usually hard drives), and they'd hop on a bike, race out to the equipment in question, and replace it with stock kept nearby.   I'd guess if you're working maybe just you or you and another guy and you have to keep tens of thousands of servers running, having access to a bike to get to the problem more quickly is important. Especially if you get half a dozen or more work orders at once scattered about the DC."

There is a reason to make those interactions boring though.  It highlights the pathetic gullible nature of caleb for being seduced by a mediocre-at-best seduction attempt.  It highlights the ease of programming a solution to seduce him, even when he is aware that he is an object of programming.  I'm not sure those were the best decisions, both in terms of entertainability and ignoring the relatively easy task of coding some female seductiveness routines.  Its unclear if the writer/director want to exploit the stupidity of most viewers to identify with a woman prisoner, or it they are infected by the same stupidity."

RoomPorn,37hny3,aristotleschild,4,Thu May 28 06:28:26 2015 UTC,"on the wooden things barring a middling shelf on every bookcase? What's their purpose?   It's hard to make out, but I believe you can see hinges on the near side of the one in the left foreground, meaning the wooden things are part of a door (?) that you can open. (I think I might also see wire mesh in front of the books, but not certain--it could just be the pattern on the books themselves.)    Anyway, traditional barrister bookcases have glass-fronted doors that you can see through, but that's more a vestige of their original function (see wikipedia link above).  I wonder if the doors in the OP's picture serve a similar function--maybe they're rare books that aren't to be accessed by any old grubby-handed person who walks by?"
RoomPorn,37hny3,salliek76,1 point,Thu May 28 06:50:51 2015 UTC,"you can see hinges on the near side of the one in the left foreground   Nice! Yes, it looks like the fascia thing all hinges out. It might be mostly aesthetic, since the top of these doors would give those cool curves which vary shelf-to-shelf, both in vertical curve and in the horizontal convexity. Seems like an artist was at work here.   I think I might also see wire mesh in front of the books   I think you're right, as the light vertical lines on the rightmost case continue across the shelves themselves. It's especially visible between the top two shelves under the curved door thing. Not sure why it's there, as these covers don't span the height of the case.  edit: Reverse Google image search found this, which describes the library thus:   House in England, the architect Piers Gough, designer Andrew Wadsworth  This home library is associated with a restaurant in the English style. Painted wooden shelving bright paint, bought the book - and a nice decoration on the theme of ""library"" is ready. And to make it look plausible, should be avoided symmetry in setting small volumes."

There is wire mesh in front of most of the books -- just to keep people from touching them (although I'm not sure if it's a recent addition, libraries used to be quite exclusive)."

If you look straight past the brightly-dressed person in this picture, you can see shelves which match the curvature of the cases our picture.

RoomPorn,37bmtb,jpberkland,2,Tue May 26 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for providing a link.   Unfortunately, if you read the PV section, the author - who is not a building professional - confuses PV with solar hot water systems (which I'm sure you'll agree are TOTALLY FUCKING ACTIVE), usually. So let's toss her confused opinion aside, sound fair?  After googling, ""are photovoltaic cells active or passive"", Results 1 & 2 don't provide a definitive answer either - speaking only to non-mechanical complexity of PV- (Note that the poorly supported SF gate article is #3).   Both Result 1 and Result 2:  - describes PV in a separate section from TOTALLY FUCKING ACTIVE solar hot water. I'd read that as supporting my approach, but you might understandably read it as supporting yours.  Shall we call it a draw and agree to disagree?"

Best example of this would be a building which is ventilated thanks to openings in the façade."
RoomPorn,37bmtb,jpberkland,2,Tue May 26 18:49:45 2015 UTC,"Let us acknowledge that the very nature of our passive vs active discussion is pedantic, so i'm not sure either of us will find any satisfaction in this. That being said, I think your definition of ""no tech"" as a defining characteristic of ""passive"" gets you off on the wrong foot.  Are operable windows ""tech""? If one considers them ""tech,"" then a concrete slab for thermal storage isn't passive. What about the silver coatings of low-e glazing? What if the window is located above reach ranges, and requires a motor to actuate? So is a motor-actuated operable window passive, but PV sitting in nearby field tied to the grid is active?  Surely, you'll agree we can both come up with examples which might not meet simplistic definitions necessary for communication of the varied building systems.   I'm not sure how renewable technologies are relevant to the discussion, perhaps you can elaborate your thinking on that."

RoomPorn,37bmtb,mia8788,3,Tue May 26 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"From the article: ""The unique eco-friendly home can be rotated by a remote control utilizing Passive Solar Energy.""  What they're saying is that the house can be rotated, using what I assume is standard electricity coming from the grid, and by rotating, can angle itself to the sun. /u/Meunderwears just misread the article. The ""passive solar energy"" is simply using the sun's rays to heat the home without the use of a central heating or furnace system. It seems like it would be a net-loss of energy but I have no idea how much power it would take to rotate a house, maybe it's not too much."

RoomPorn,372urx,xambreh,-1,Sun May 24 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"It looks nice, but it seems like a really bad choice for a floor. It would be cold, things you dropped would get damaged more so than if it were carpet, etc."
RoomPorn,372urx,wightrussian,7,Sun May 24 16:43:50 2015 UTC,Carpet in a kitchen? Are you nuts?
RoomPorn,372urx,BlazeJeffrey,-1,Sun May 24 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the picture isn't a kitchen. There's a couch, a recliner, a dining table..."
RoomPorn,372urx,soretits,2,Sun May 24 19:34:07 2015 UTC,i am pretty sure polished concrete will be easy to repair though. at least it will be easier than fixing a tile.
RoomPorn,372urx,fightONstate,1 point,Mon May 25 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"...if it needs to be repaired.  I think they meant damage to the items dropped on the floor.  If the concrete was mixed well and setup correctly you shouldn't have problems with it for a very long time.  It also shouldn't be affected by any kitchen items being dropped on it.  Though the finish may need to be polished up or redone overtime, the actual floor should be fine."
RoomPorn,372urx,lurker1200,3,Tue Jun 16 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"Looking at the pictures of the kitchen, you would think it's a pretty small place, but the floor plans reveals otherwise, actually a large space."

RoomPorn,372urx,serra627,3,Sun May 24 11:32:19 2015 UTC,Why high bay fixtures?  They must be gutted and fixed up with normal interior lamps.
RoomPorn,372urx,x65535x,4,Sun May 24 15:39:40 2015 UTC,I think it's better than the track lighting!
RoomPorn,372urx,ProjectileHerpes,2,Sun May 24 16:21:31 2015 UTC,Probably low bay fixtures that were gutted and simply have an A shape lamp inside without a formed reflector. I imagine it provides a very nice light.

RoomPorn,372urx,tasmanian101,1 point,Wed May 27 13:37:16 2015 UTC,Too much black all in one place. A dash of colour here and there (And make some windows for the cupboards) would make the kitchen look more lively and attractive.
RoomPorn,372urx,brainfilter,6,Sun May 24 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Its one of the new modern colors. The only black is the fridge and counter, which nicely accent the charcoal grey. It looks very sleek, and modern.  I'm curious what color you would add? Do you not like a minimalist approach to decor?"
RoomPorn,372urx,tittypuncher,1 point,Sun May 24 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of minimalism. But there should be some contrast as opposed to a big blob of darkness.   The fridge could be silver perhaps. And like I said, the cupboard could have windows (translucent or transparent). Also, the island could be white, but I'm not sure how good that would look.  Anyway, nothing drastic needs to be done. Just a little variety."
RoomPorn,372urx,ttamimi,-1,Sun May 24 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not the op, but some orange would bring out the brick nicely and make the kitchen less sterile imo."

RoomPorn,3734lj,invenio78,6,Tue May 26 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"I love aquariums but as large objects in homes they don't look good to me.  In a beachside hotel bar/restaurant, sure.    Visually, I'd take a smaller, like 50 gallons or less, heavily planted tank with no plastic or coloured lights, over a huge ostentatious marine tank any day (and not just for the insane expense and upkeep). I think small planted tanks can look really good the way potted plants, indoor palms/ferns and terrariums look good. Little capsules of greenery and nature.    But this thing? You just know this thing has bright blue lights in the lid, and all the filtration, pumps etc are gonna be reasonably noisy, day in, day out.   Plus, many marine fish are notoriously fragile, so you might well be looking at some dead fish, stuck floating under the breakfast bar and getting its fins and eyes eaten by its tankmates while you're trying to eat."

If the window was a screen you could even lie on the floor and still see buildings. Also moving left and right would reveal different views... Try it at your window.
RoomPorn,36zbx9,ptitz,1 point,Sat May 23 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Try it at your window   sure, for a house, but not for this view, with the horizon quite far off in the distance.  a very large (by today's standards) curved screen at high enough DPI would be very difficult to distinguish from a real view, from the bed here at least.  Note that I am not proposing the screen replace the windows, it would be behind the windows, to heighten the illusion."

In fact, it has been suggested that the word ultimately derives from the Arawak barbacoa, meaning ""wooden frame on posts"".  Besides, it is only really in American English that barbecue even refers to the food.  There is nothing wrong with referring to the barbecue grill as a barbecue, as you so confidently suggested.

The next year I saved up to build the main deck, which cost $900, then spent another $900 doing the roof in the fall. Many yards of fabric this year and a coat of stain for $200, and the furniture/rug/lights cost 400. Just build your oasis bits at a time, don't do it in one go. Also, people like progress, so there is that... This is r/roomporn, and I don't know if you've seen the other posts here, but my budget is TINY compared to that. You could downsize your deck by a little, and get the same thing for x% off. The great part about building your own things is that the more time you invest, the less you spend. For example, if you built the same deck without pressure treating, you can seal it yourself."

The unit I was in had a guestroom bar where that vanity was, bathroom in the same spot. 9th floor is pretty low too. You should see what the upper floors are like. This building was also the site of the Abscam sting.  If I'm not mistaken, when the building transitioned from a hotel into a hotel/condo, they let buyers buy multiple units and knock walls down to create monster living spaces. That is why you see such wild floorplans in all the floors. The building is historic now, so I'm not sure if they allow that anymore. Stand on Locust St, and you'll see only one unit with a hard-fought balcony.   Edit: Seeing your link now. That is a nice upper-floor unit! The stuffiest people in Philly live in that building."

When I went into the job the client was adamant they wanted the sea view and island showing to emphasise it's location. I edited one similar to your example (No problem for using the image by the way) but they came back asking if I could show the view more. With them being more focused on building and labor, I don't think they tend to understand the inside to outside light ratio of photography. They ended up being rather happy in the end..."

RoomPorn,36hahg,deadgloves,2,Tue May 19 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! I still feel that I have a long way to go until I'm completely satisfied with my images, but I'm learning more with every shoot.  Focal length changes depending on a lot of factors. This was shot at 13mm (DX/APS-C) but I slightly cropped it in to about 15mm (22ish mm on full frame). I have a 24mm tilt shift arriving this week which I'm excited about and feel that's a great focal length to showcase rooms without the ultra wide distortion taking over."

The room seems to be centred around the poker table, probably the go to activity for him and his friends. The cars are literally decor, I'm sure it'd be nice sitting at the table overlooking some of the most beautiful cars ever made. Given that it's a man cave and most of the other players would be guys who would appreciate cars, I couldn't think of better decor (sure it's sad they'll probably never be driven but most of the players on that table probably don't have a shortage of other high end cars they keep for actual driving).  The jukebox / piano / etc. around the room are pretty tasteful as well. Gives the impression of a gentleman's club / bar.   I think this is rich man cave done right."

If he really played shuffleboard he wouldn't have it stuck against the wall like that.    The jukebox / piano / etc. around the room are pretty tasteful as well.   Good God.

RoomPorn,365ri9,hippister,1 point,Sun May 17 10:11:45 2015 UTC,I don't work in real estate but I would say so. Do your homework because it is Mexico and there is a lot of shady people and lots of shady operations.  Also it depends on why you are buying. If you wanna buy it and use it yourself and are happy with that great. But if you buy it as an investment and want to rent it out make sure you can get clients yourself. Property management companies very often don't rent out your place or even rent them out without telling you. But again there are also good management companies here.  Playa just keeps growing and growing - it's pretty crazy to follow. I have a dog and walk a lot and every 3-6 months there's a new building getting started.

RoomPorn,365ri9,hippister,1 point,Sat May 16 21:00:42 2015 UTC,Yes - it's fairly easy to live in Mexico legally especially if you come from certain countries and if you have some money for living expenses. Getting a work permit is a bit harder but also easy compared to many other countries
RoomPorn,365ri9,randomSAPguy,1 point,Sat May 16 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"I'm Northern Mexican (was in Playa del Carmen about 2 weeks ago) and I wanted to know the perspective of an immigrant living in Mexico, where are you from? How do you feel about the immigration issues of your country?"
RoomPorn,365ri9,hippister,1 point,Sat May 16 21:11:23 2015 UTC,I'm Danish so I don't think you can find a more different culture compared to the Mexican :)  What do you mean my perspective ? How it is living here or my view on Mexico/Mexicans ?  Denmark is famous/infamous for their tough immigration laws and I think statistically we take less immigrants than most of our neighboring countries. We have some immigration integration problems but nothing mayor I would say. The thing is in Denmark that everything works do damn well there and if there is a small issue it gets so much media attention just like the integration problem we have.
RoomPorn,365ri9,randomSAPguy,1 point,Sun May 17 13:01:26 2015 UTC,"More likely, what do you think about immigrants in Denmark?"
RoomPorn,365ri9,hippister,1 point,Sun May 17 17:31:26 2015 UTC,If they behave and try to integrate then its great especially if they can bring something new to Denmark. But honestly I have not lived in Denmark for 12 years so I might not be the right person to ask :)

RoomPorn,365ri9,lianabear,1 point,Sun May 17 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, why are you opposed to immigrants? And what are your feelings on Mexican emigrants (to the U.S. and elsewhere)?"
RoomPorn,365ri9,randomSAPguy,1 point,Wed May 20 07:17:45 2015 UTC,"Basically for the same reasons as someone from the US doesn't like them, plus, they certainly don't bring anything good for our country, as a federal worker, they evade taxes and social security fees which leads to more problems than you can imagine. And certainly, it doesn't help our unenployment rates, as some employer (badly, of course) prefer to hire immigrants as they benefit from tax evasion. Lastly, some of them (can't say every one) feels above the law when they are in Mexico, specially people from the US or Europe; Like, when they buy a front beach property, they want to block access to our beach, but the Mexican law declares beaches as a good of public use, thus available for every Mexican citizen. Lots of immigrants doesn't seem to understand this.  I don't mind tourists tho, as long as they behave in a civil manner.  Regarding Mexican emmigrants, for those that were educated and got a profession from a public funded university, I totally despise them, as the county spent resources forming a better professional so they would help developing our economy but instead they choose to bretay their own country and leave. For the low class Mexicans that decided to go out and seek better opportunities out there, I can't judge all of them, but I sincerely think that if they wanted our nation to change they should have stayed here definetely. And pressure our goverment to create more equal opportunities for everyone, but instead, they choose the easy way out. Now the illegal ones, I think is stupid from their part to fight for the right to stay in a country that never permitted them to stay or work there, it's not their county, they should respect its laws.  I could go with a list of things but I think you might get the idea."

RoomPorn,35yqbn,fnord_happy,15,Fri May 15 11:04:50 2015 UTC,Here is the Ted Talk.
RoomPorn,35yqbn,ArmoredCavalry,8,Thu May 14 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Watched this yesterday. Just had one issue with it, they kinda were selling it like something that could be an alternative to traditional lumber/wood.  In reality it seemed more like they catered only to huge projects of wealthy builders? They pretty much explained how with Bamboo, nothing was standard, and each project had to be unique. Well, that means it would be hard to ever bring the price down too (for large structures)."
RoomPorn,35yqbn,frigidmouse,7,Thu May 14 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"In the Colombian countryside, they use bamboo (guadua) to build because it's more earthquake resistant than other common building materials due to its flexibility. And in regions where bamboo grows in abundance, it's a great alternative. However, its use is limited to single-family home sized structures, and the chemicals used to treat the bamboo aren't particularly environmentally friendly."
RoomPorn,35yqbn,witoldc,5,Thu May 14 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"No idea why you are being downvoted.  You're exactly right.   She mentions this reality in her talk; tons of poor people in the region have bamboo houses and they SUCK and they don't want them.  Bamboo is cheap and versatile.  But everything else that it takes to build a bamboo house is a massive expense.  You save a few bucks on bamboo, and you waste a ton of money on everything else.  That's fine if you're in the business of building multi-million dollar vacation homes for rich people, but it doesn't scale down to reality.  It doesn't even scale down to US reality, not to mention Indonesia reality.  Speaking of which, Bali is like an alternate world where you have these rich people building multi-million dollar vacation homes right next to very poor locals living in their bamboo crappy homes.  It's a place where you can find a room for $5/night right around the corner from $1000/night place.  It's rather strange.  That said, we do have bamboo flooring.  Maybe in the same way we make bamboo flooring, we can make 2x4 and other beams?    But the way she does it?  It's strictly a cool gimmick for the rich."
RoomPorn,35yqbn,ArmoredCavalry,3,Fri May 15 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yeap, exactly, the way she talks about it, sounds  like it is pretty much good for two things -  1) Super cheap/small structures made of untreated bamboo (decays)  2) Huge, uniquely designed, expensive projects with treated bamboo  Really doesn't seem like a replacement yet for average sized houses built with regular lumber."
RoomPorn,35yqbn,Truthfull,1 point,Fri May 15 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"I met one of the guys in the construction group they made (friend of a friend type deal) he took us to the restaurant she showed and some of the houses. He kept saying how every project was unique, talked about how each piece of bamboo came in non standard sizes.   As far as I could tell each house was a work of art type deal. So I agree with you that what they are doing is unlikely to get cheaper."

RoomPorn,35yqbn,nIsmoerIc,9,Fri May 15 03:57:47 2015 UTC,"This is all nice in theory, but coming from someone who just stayed in one of these awesomely cool bamboo cottages it has many downfalls. Mainly, you must be prepared to deal with an unsealed room in Bali - meaning spiders, big ants, flying big ants, and mosquito's all around you while you relax and sleep. I realized I much prefer an air conditioned sealed room than to wrap up in a not so effective mosquito net and deal with so many exotic bugs day and night. They like to congregate around your mosquito net at night so getting in and out causes them to fall on you. Sorry to be a downer, just my 2¢ from experience."

But most of the time in construction what happens is the ceiling framing goes up, then you wire electricity and a/c ducts and what not, then you either attach plywood or drywall to the framing, and then you install some sort of pretty surface on top of that. Paint, stucco, wood planks etc. So that's why I was saying it might explain the ""running out of money""comment that I replied to."

RoomPorn,35hlbq,RadiumGirl,76,Mon May 11 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"It's odd how futuristic design doesn't exist when looking back. Looking back it always (like this one) seems like Extreme Expressions of contemporary style and design, rather than anything truly futuristic."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,nate_rausch,68,Mon May 11 11:06:13 2015 UTC,"IMO it's impossible to design something ""truly futuristic"" as that would require knowledge of what the future trends will be. People can only make guesses and extrapolate from their contemporary style and design.  Generally ""futuristic"" is somewhat impossible to truly reach in real life. Futuristic is something that always evokes something that is not present, but imaginary future. It's an aesthetic we acknowledge has not been normal, common or prevalent, but has been imagined to be in the future.   When the future really is here, we generally stop considering it as futuristic. Like I would guess most people don't consider this Apple laptop being futuristic, because the time of that aesthetic has passed. Likewise we don't consider cars like this futuristic, because that aesthetic is common and seen every day. The day we get used to futuristic design, it ceases to be futuristic. Futuristic is rather the feeling of novelty of some design, and when the novelty becomes common and prevalent in every day life, it ceases to be a novelty."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,Toppo,6,Sun May 10 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"that bmw wasnt really considered futuristic at the time of design. in fact I'd go as far as to say that BMW dont really make futuristic production cars (exception would probably be the i8). A better example of a futuristic car that looks less futuristic as time goes on would be the European Honda Civic (2006+) (front, back) which seemed very futuristic compared compared to its contemporaries (1, 2, 3)"
RoomPorn,35hlbq,ItsTyrrellYo,6,Sun May 10 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"My point was that seen from the past, the BMW still was a car of the future, and definitely different design language than was prevalent in the 80's, 70's, 60's or 50's. Yet we don't consider it ""futuristic"", even though it is ""truly futuristic"", something which wasn't really anticipated and wasn't prevalent in the past but ended up being true future.  And what makes that Honda Civic futuristic is mainly the continuous headlights. They give a futuristic vibe for the very reason that design is uncommon, not often seen. If every car would have headlights like that, we would not consider that design futuristic anymore, like we don't consider the BMW futuristic anymore."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,Toppo,2,Sun May 10 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Even going into the 90s, the E38 (1995) and the E65 (2002) could not have been any different, it was a very unique design, a very brave move by BMW."

RoomPorn,35hlbq,Stankia,9,Sun May 10 19:04:25 2015 UTC,That's why it's called retro futurism. It's how the past saw the future.
RoomPorn,35hlbq,onthefence928,6,Mon May 11 02:31:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that.   Here's a still from the 1927 sci-fi film Metropolis. 1927's dystopian future doesn't look too different from The Hunger Game's dystopian future. But maybe that's cheating because it's set design for a fictional future.   The 1947 Noguchi coffee table still looks pretty futuristic to me.   And almost everything designed by Buckminster Fuller is pretty futuristic, too."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,BluShine,12,Sun May 10 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, The Hunger Games specifically went for an Art Deco style for the Capital architecture; which is why it sort of matches Metropolis, which is from the Art Deco period."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,Geekofmanytrades,1 point,Sun May 10 19:16:55 2015 UTC,"True. But it seems like most of the ""futuristic""-styled modern design seems to be some variant of Art Deco, Cubist, or Modernist.   Also, biomorphic design seems to be constantly lurking at the edges, but always just a bit too ""weird"" to take over the future. Its influence is obvious in a lot of the 3D printed design work that I see. But it seems like it'll never take over the mainstream."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,BluShine,3,Sun May 10 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"A propos of nothing, that Noguchi table has always seemed to me to be terribly tacky in a early-90s-attempt-at-avantgarde kind of way. Turns me right off anytime I see it used."

RoomPorn,35hlbq,thetrumpetplayer,11,Mon May 11 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Retro-future design is always so cool. The way that people from different eras imagined the future is bizarre. It's like everyone thinks ""Exactly like now, but slightly more ambitious, and with crazy shapes"" and each era has its own 'now' and definition of 'crazy shapes' so it always looks different."

I know there are some interesting things that came out of that time period, but overall it just seems like the ""Dark Ages"" of design...   It seems like there was a really awkward shift with the advancing technology at the time and nobody really knew how to implement it, and so it resulted in a whole mess of weird design choices."

RoomPorn,35hlbq,Suppaduppa,2,Sun May 10 23:14:21 2015 UTC,"On close inspection, the ""carpet"" looks like a ""pebbled"" linoleum. You can see the light reflecting off of it behind the table in a way that would not happen with carpet.  Still horrible, but a lot better than puke green shag carpet in the dining room."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,Uncle_Erik,10,Sun May 10 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Today, we get a lot of faux-Italianate interiors and faux antiques made of crappy wood stained very dark.  Furniture stores are full of this junk.  While I'm not crazy about everything here, it is very interesting and the designer(s) made an effort to be original.  I like it.  In 2015, we're in the middle of another hideously ugly decade.  Possibly worse than the 1970s.  Most people won't notice it for another ten years, but today's stuff is stinky."
RoomPorn,35hlbq,SimmSalaBim,3,Mon May 11 02:29:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think we're sort of coming out of a stinky period in design, including interiors.  As a whole, I think we're rediscovering modernism in design, and that theme flows through all kinds of products. There's a parallelism there, when all your stuff -- clothes, electronics, furniture -- are of a common aesthetic.  My perception of the 90s (and I'm 27, so take this with a grain of salt) is that there was less of a common thread throughout culture.  People bought big houses in the suburbs and just filled them with a random assortment of Ethan Alan furniture and a giant black TV that didn't match anything.  There seems to be a little more curating involved at this point."

They're about at the depth you want when you're eating.  Now look at how much legroom you have.  The amount of legroom there is less than what you'd get in most coach airplane seats. And where do your feet go?  You can maybe tuck the first couple inches of your foot in that toespace.  Good luck if you want to cross your legs.  This is not a dining table. This is a table which is first-and-foremost meant to look different.

Why should we dictate where people will eat when they are so busy working or whatever that they hardly sit down as a family? Wood paneling is expensive and people would have to have it ripped out instead of painted over. And let's not use metal for the chairs, plastic is cheaper but weaker so we need a more practical design. Those strips in the floor? Too much time to put in an maintain because it's far cheaper to just throw down carpet or hardwood.  Also, breakfast is grapefruit???"

RoomPorn,35hlbq,Arcitct,1 point,Mon May 11 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. The fiberglass production was halted in 1989 due to environmental and safety hazards and then reintroduced later on in plastic, which is more environmentally friendly and recyclable. In 2013, due to improved technologies of 3D wood bending, a new edition of molded wood side chairs were introduced. Even though the Eameses did not truly collaborate with this new form of their product, it was justified because they never found a way to make a chair from a single piece of bent plywood. In 2014 the fiberglass version was reintroduced in a more sustainable and recyclable form of the material."

Most people want moderate jet pressure and minimum bells and whistles, typically you should be able to get into a decent tub of good quality for 6-9k.

I just looked around on google maps street view and it's either the east river apartment buildings just north of the U.N. but the photo would've had to be taken before the U.N. tower was built.

RoomPorn,34ywi1,BrutalNoob,15,Tue May 5 23:45:53 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with Moscow other than the weather and US relations?  (Serious question)
RoomPorn,34ywi1,railla,17,Wed May 6 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"a lot of things (saying that as someone who lived there for over 10 years)   it's polluted, plus humidity is very low for the most of the year, so whole city suffers from respiratory diseases and flu seasonally. it's a city for cars, not people (it was originally designed to accommodate much smaller population, and that population was supposed to traverse the city using public transport, mostly), so there's not enough parking and driving space for all the cars. And there's a lot of cars there, cars parked on the side walk, in the last lane (sic!) of the road, just in random places are a common, totally mundane thing. public transportation has to endure all the traffic jams (it's getting better lately, with the Transport Department getting more data-driven, but it's can only get that much better without some major replanning of the roads, which will probably never happen) you have to endure if you are crazy enough to actually use private car inside the city. it's extremely depressing, there are at least two reasons for that. Firstly, the city has an 'imperial' feel to it, especially the parts build during the best of soviet times, so it's practically designed to make you feel like you are nothing. Secondly, that one season that includes winter as well as part of spring and autumn looks very gloomy if you are spending it in the city --- dirty-grey snowy gruel everywhere, dirty-grey cement, dirty-grey asphalt, dirty-grey post-soviet apartment buildings, hundreds of them (just look at this abomination), dirty-white sky, not enough UV, all that. metro, that glorious metro with stations that sometimes look like underground palaces, was, again, designed to serve a much much smaller population, and is practically always working on the verge of collapse nowadays (this and this is fairly normal). E.g. average time between the trains during the rush hour on some lines can be around 30 seconds, and people still have to ""pack"" themselves shoulder first to get a ride. the real estate market in Moscow is, to put it mildly, unreasonable --- rent prices are high, even for an average babushka's flat, but it's more about a shitty state of every market in RF nowadays, then Moscow, so probably irrelevant here. Also, most of the real estate market operates in a grey area, so fuck contracts, garanties, all the good things.   Overall, all those pointers make people very annoyed and even angry all the time, which doesn't make anyone's life any more pleasant. E.g., it makes the situation on the roads worse in general (annoyed people make more mistakes and break more rules on the road, which makes driving in Moscow a living hell). Also, I cannot say this for other people, but when I had to waste so many hours either in the metro, feeling like a pickled herring, or in any kind of above-the-ground transportation that would get stuck in a jam for hours, I was literally feeling my life being stolen from me, that adds to the whole experience as well. Of course, if you are earning above the average, and if you can move into the centre, and practically walk to you work place (or take a 15-minutes ride from/to a non-overloaded metro station), then it's slightly better, but still not good enough in my experience.  Or, if you can afford that place from the topic, along with a private helicopter, then there's nothing wrong with Moscow =]  edited: typos"

RoomPorn,34ywi1,ukraineisnotweak,1 point,Thu May 7 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"I have not been in about two decades now, but I am pretty familiar with Russian culture. Yes, I was born in Ukraine (but I am also a Seinfeld fan), so take my statements with a grain of salt if you'd like, but I am just describing what I see.  I have a lot of Russian friends, so the culture ideals I obtain mainly come from them. The western media does have influence on me as well, of course. Russia has always had a patriarchy type of macho culture - which is problematic because it's a male dominant society that praises men for being ""strong"". For instance, it has long continued to dismiss mental health as a real struggle, most likely because it is a sign of personal weakness. It might not be as overt as one might expect in  a country like, say, Libya, for example, but it's there.  I would have to disagree with you on the bigotry comparison of the US. Here in the US it is completely unacceptable to be overtly racist and bigoted. Yes, in some small circles it is ok, but generally speaking it's not. The same can't be said for Russian people. Racial, anti-semitic, bigoted slurs may as well be part of their language.  Look, it seems like you have a very strong affinity towards this country and you may think that I just completely hate it. I don't, I have close friends who are Russian and also have Russian family. They are great people, but as a society they always have, and most likely always will be behind all other western countries."

RoomPorn,34ql1t,Steelen,32,Sun May 3 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely a concept. No one would put those fish in that little water. They have tangs, angels, and a moorish idol in a tank that's barely a foot wide and its widest point.  It's also hanging 300+ lbs of water from 2 stainless steel pipes. Just doesn't seem like a good idea."
RoomPorn,34ql1t,sransbury,8,Sun May 3 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"At 8' by 4' by 1', that's about 240 gallons of water. 10 lbs per gallon of saltwater is more like 2400 pounds. Suspended from a fire suppression sprinkler pipe. Nope."

RoomPorn,34ql1t,unjung,3,Sun May 3 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Agree.  Reflections don't match and while the other pipes cast shadows on the ceiling, the ones holding the tanks don't."
RoomPorn,34ql1t,phobos512,4,Sun May 3 22:16:50 2015 UTC,Yup. And there are really no green macroalgaes common in the saltwater hobby that you could grow in that tank.   We could go on and on.

RoomPorn,34ql1t,themanlnthesuit,11,Mon May 4 06:24:47 2015 UTC,"keeping fish, specially those in the picture is way more demanding than it looks. In terms of space and geometry these tanks are completely unsuitable for practically anything but a few guppies. Tall, thin tanks have a very bad reputation because they don't allow enough gas exchange at the top where the co2 can dissipate and more oxygen enter the water. They're known as ""towers of death"" in the hobby. Welcome to /r/Aquariums"

RoomPorn,34ql1t,my_sfw_account,4,Wed May 6 03:31:30 2015 UTC,My guess would be because the tanks are so skinny.  Depending on the fish they may have issues turning around.  That was my first thought.
RoomPorn,34ql1t,elfootman,2,Mon May 4 06:32:39 2015 UTC,Because if I were a fish I wouldn't like to be in such small aquarium.

RoomPorn,34ql1t,altiuscitiusfortius,2,Sun May 3 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"That glass has to be inches thick to support the pressure of thousands of pounds of water on those seams, especially to be a rimless design.

RoomPorn,34ql1t,dpaanlka,6,Mon May 4 03:55:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, such heavy tanks of water dangling like that would make me feel uncomfortable no matter how irrational that feeling might be. I would much prefer these stationed firmly on the ground."

I'm actually involved in the construction industry so I should probably know this.   This is likely a single family house, qualifying as R-3 with type V-B, which seemed unlikely in Manhattan. Those historic lumber joists may have qualified as type IV somehow, too.  I was also thinking there might also be sprinklers.   Lastly, that large stair opening might've meant the upstairs is a mezzanine, which might come with more lax standards."

RoomPorn,34ip46,b0gg3r,1 point,Fri May 1 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"But the stove is so hot that it will turn the water directly into gas. While the room temperature may be less than the evaporating point, the water molecules are still above temperature, therefore you have the heating effect without the steam.  So, if the water is all in the form of gas, not steam, will it affect the salt bricks? I guess it will whenever it inevitably cools down past the boiling point, right?"
RoomPorn,34ip46,Aldring,2,Sat May 2 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, the water condenses from gas into droplets quite quickly.

RoomPorn,34ip46,MrJDouble,6,Sat May 2 03:38:32 2015 UTC,This is just a load of bullshit. Sauna is a Finnish word. Try to find a Sauna in Finland where it was 120F warm and they didn't throw water on the rocks. Such blasphemy. Proper Sauna is very humid.
RoomPorn,34ip46,Molehole,1 point,Sat May 2 09:56:47 2015 UTC,"Actually the Finnish sauna overall is not that humid. The humidity of water lasts only briefly. If a Finnish sauna would not be that dry, temperatures from 80 and up would be unbearable, like no one in Finland (from my experience) throws water continuously to the stones, as that would make the humidity so high that the heat is unbearable in long term. There are pauses between throwing the water to let the air dry again. Finnish sauna in essence is a mix of dry heat and humidity."
RoomPorn,34ip46,Toppo,1 point,Sat May 2 14:28:43 2015 UTC,I think most people here are talking about Finnish Sauna like how many foreigners use Saunas (don't throw any water on the stove). Then it's really dry like the one I was in Hungary. I'd think Sauna still has relatively high humidity and wouldn't make roofs from something that dissolves.
RoomPorn,34ip46,Molehole,1 point,Sat May 2 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"The heat in Finnish saunas is still very dry and is produced by burning wood or by electrical kiuas. Throwing water brings little steam and humidity, but the ventilation and dry heat in saunas keep the humidity levels relatively low.  Where as in steam rooms the heat is produced by boiling water in to a hot steam, and there is no ventilation at all, so the relative humidity is much higher at around 100%."
RoomPorn,34ip46,julle_1,1 point,Sat May 2 14:56:33 2015 UTC,Makes sense
RoomPorn,34ip46,Molehole,1 point,Sat May 2 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yea I've been to those very dry saunas in the Netherlands and Germany, and they suck, but still, even the Finnish sauna is quite dry, but the difference is that we temporarily increase the humidity, and even then the air does not get ""very humid"". According to this paper, the air humidity of a hot Finnish sauna is about 10%, whereas a recommended optimal room air humidity is around 45%. Throwing water does increase the humidity, but not to very humid, but rather the air gets very humid only in surfaces like skin (or glass door as the writer says). He has a good analogue, that when you come from cold air to inside, the normal room humidity of 45% condenses to your glasses, even though normal room air isn't considered humid. Same happens in sauna, the vapor condenses to your skin and windows and such, even though the air isn't that humid. Central European saunas skip the water throwing, so you don't feel the heat of the sauna, but if they'd throw water, I'd imagine salt bricks being the kind of surface where the water condenses, even though the overall air humidity is not high.  Steam rooms have temperature (less than) half of Finnish saunas, but as they are very humid compared to Finnish saunas, the temperature can feel close to Finnish saunas."
RoomPorn,34ip46,Toppo,1 point,Sat May 2 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if you actually read what the commenter above said, but technically he is correct on all points.   (Finnish) saunas are actually relatively dry and hot (70-100 celsius) and like you said, water is thrown on the rocks, where as steam rooms are the opposite - very humid and lower temperature.  Source: Finnish and go to sauna almost daily"
RoomPorn,34ip46,julle_1,13,Sat May 2 14:38:56 2015 UTC,"Proper saunas do have steam in them. The very point of proper saunas is to throw water on the stones so that the air gets very humid with steam and the steam conducts the heat to your body. I suspect the sauna in this photo isn't a proper sauna, but a common Central European lite-sauna, where it's not that hot and it's just dry and boring. The seats are too low/the ceiling too high for a proper sauna."
RoomPorn,34ip46,Toppo,1 point,Fri May 1 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"You throw water on the stones in sauna. There is quite a lot of steam and there is also some humidity.  You are talking about dry sauna probably, or swedish sauna, which is not that popular."
RoomPorn,34ip46,WillyWankerFagtory,3,Fri May 1 17:57:36 2015 UTC,You are correct about Saunas and these people don't know shit. They aren't filled with as much steam as Turkish type steam houses but they are definitely very humid.  Source: Been to Sauna at least 500 times.

I'm just not a big fan of the gray expanses you get as a result. How hard/expensive would it be to tile some of those floors and add some color and texture?   It's a nice house and I do like the design. Just saying there are some small touches that could give a better feel and take this place to another level.

There was a fleet of four privately owned mega yachts I recently saw that was temporarily birthed in San Diego. The main yacht was a sleek, modern, cruiser at 287' feet long (sorry I can't remember the name), the next was this sailing yacht, whose main mast is as tall as a 30 story building, and then there were two other beautiful teak sailing yachts with traditional sails and rigging both at 150'+ feet long. They all had the same fleet flag and were believed to have a home port in Croatia.

The view is truly magnificent; with some luck you can see the elephants and giraffes roaming below while you're taking a bath. I visited several beautiful resorts during my trip to Kenya but Elsa's Kopje (named for the lioness) was by far the most memorable. They also have an incredible infinity pool.

I see tacky and slightly dated looking ceiling spotlights that probably won't illuminate a hell of a lot considering the high ceilings, sparsely placed positions and generally weak cold beam most of these new LED energy efficient bulbs give off. The generic fibre/bamboo-ish outdoor furniture couch, the matte finish slightly coarse cushions, the glossy white coffee table. Meh. Designer, overpriced IKEA pieces.  I see all that glass and just think of hand prints and, face smushes, leaves and general sea/rain gunk residue that's going to dry on it and be a bitch to clean and require constant cleaning to look that good.  Keep in mind this is gorgeous, breathtaking and I'm about to enroll in jelly school next semester because I'm seriously jelly. But still. I just see rich people problems to the design, I can't even enjoy the fucking fantasy of living here. I hate being a grownup."

You can rope swing across the stream if you're really brave. There are only around 10 cabins, so everyone eats dinner together at a long table in an old barn (a much different decor). When I was there, the strawberry farms across the road were in perfect season, so all of the deserts had fresh strawberries from that day. * sigh *, better days...   It was actually pretty cheap compared to literally everything else in Norway, if I'm remembering correctly. It was a rude awakening when my 20 minute cab ride from the airport was $200 USD!"

RoomPorn,341yaa,Joseph_P_Brenner,4,Tue Apr 28 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Most of Ikea's bad rep comes from bandwagon jumping.  People always tell me how much they love my place, and they're always shocked to learn that half of my furniture is Ikea.  Depending on your intent, there's some stuff at Ikea that is a waste of money and some stuff that is a smart use of money.  For example, if you want floating shelves that don't need high durability, Ikea's Lack shelves are practically identical to floating shelves that are a hundred times pricier.  Personally though, I would have bought Modernica pendants instead of those Ikea Fillstas."

My evidence:  1) Why would a book lover put a giant screen in their library?  2) Who would put a giant screen in a room filled with windows?  3) The desk in front of the door. Why?   4) The white chaise lounge that doesn't match anything else in the room, also it's blocking the bookcase.   5) Ditto for those pillows.

It's like they made a list of things that would make the least sense in a sun room and used that as the blue print. Can't see the TV, too bright to read, the projector ruins one of the best architectural features in the room, dark furniture that will be hot af after sitting in the sun all day, and dark rugs, furniture, and books that will all be faded by the sun even with UV protection on the windows."

RoomPorn,33wzw7,comicsnerd,0,Fri May 15 10:26:36 2015 UTC,"That makes zero sense, seeing as the old canal houses are built around the 1600's where the average height of the dutch people was far lower than it is today. Because people didn't need much room, the ceilings were also a lot lower. Sure maybe it isn't 1.80 but hey, hyperbole is an artform. In fact, us dutchmen used to be one of the smallest people in Europe!  I'm 1.92 and I always bump my head in old canal houses."

The majority of the Newport mansions (including Marble House) were built during a period called ""The Gilded Age."" Basically, if you were rich then it was a time to be ostentatious about how much money you had. One of the best ways to demonstrate that was through opulent architecture and home decor.

RoomPorn,33pfyc,lsp2005,12,Fri Apr 24 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda like it. It's not that outrageously expensive and opulent by the way. I recently had to redo a bathroom and found some onyx (enough to do this room) for about $21/ft in 2x2 tiles. So, that room is about 20X12 I think, with maybe 12' ceilings. The roughest estimate would price that at $16K today for the onyx. Now, you've got A LOT of labour to intsall properly and lets say he's using a higher quality stone in larger slabs so maybe 2-3x the price, that' still only $45K in stone, so ball park, I could probably build that room, like this for around $100k. That's a lot, but as home reno's go, I've seen people blow 100K on much stupider things. You've got guys on $200K salaries dumping $100K on a car that gets ditched in 5 years all the time, and those guys aren't super rich, not in the league you are insinuating at least.   Point being, stop hating people richer than you because you assume everything they do is just to show off, most people couldn't give a shit. The guy (or his architect) might have just thought this would look cool so built it. And I agree with them, I think it's kinda pretty and certainly copies a 1700-1800s european look that I've always been fond of."

RoomPorn,33pfyc,jugdealer,3,Sat Apr 25 05:30:25 2015 UTC,When marble is cut into slabs the veins of colour can be mirrored when opened like a book. Put your hands together and open them to see a similar symmetry. This website gives a number of examples of simple symmetry ( http://becauseimaddicted.net/2014/03/book-matched-marble.html ) If you look in the OP  the wall to the right side has an arch with that pattern repeated 4 times. The more heavily veined the stone the the more complicated it gets because they can easily fall apart and break ruining the illusion.
RoomPorn,33pfyc,Rand0mtask,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:50:30 2015 UTC,Ah! That's brilliant. Thank you for answering!
RoomPorn,33pfyc,jugdealer,3,Sat Apr 25 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"You are most welcome. It is a beautiful way of exposing the natural beauty of the stone. Aside from the process of getting it installed, it is very time consuming to maintain the integrity of the block of stone as it is moved. Not all slab stone comes from Italy, but, way back when I was in the industry, most stone was sent to Italy to be slabbed then distributed world wide. The loading and unloading has to be carefully done. A single slab can weigh a ton and has to be place next to it's twinned slabs when stored. So when I see this I am thrilled that along the supply chain, great care was taken so that gorgeous effects like this can be done. It is an expensive effect because material is cut away to get the veining to match up because the gangsawing removes areas of continuity. You will see a similar effect with wood veneer, unfortunately the thinner you cut stone the more brittle it gets."
RoomPorn,33pfyc,blueharpy,2,Sat Apr 25 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I absolutely do not argue the craftsmanship. It IS gorgeous in respect to the skill with which it was done, but the overall effect is like sitting in a room plastered with raw hamburger, which is unfortunate :/"

Except back then it was all about showing off so they had lots of courses with tons of food and it wasn't about eating, but the showing off. This lead to the next course being brought out as soon as the previous was fully served. Each diner would only get a bite or two before their plate was whisked away by footmen to be replaced by the next course. Most people left these lunches starving."

Christ, how are you people this stupid? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million   One million (1,000,000) or one thousand thousand, is the natural number following 999,999 and preceding 1,000,001. The word is derived from the early Italian millione (milione in modern Italian), from mille, ""thousand"", plus the augmentative suffix -one.[1]  In scientific notation, it is written as 1×106 or just 106.[2] Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega, when dealing with SI units. For example, 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.  It can be abbreviated MM, mm or mn in some financial contexts. The meaning of the word ""million"" is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems."

Seriously though, where is this persons stuff?  There's a cat but no litter box, food, or water in sight.   Do they have clothes? Is there a closet or storage I'm not seeing?"
RoomPorn,33l1r7,Mikerk,8,Thu Apr 23 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"All the stuff is on the 14th floor. Remember, they built vertically."

RoomPorn,33l1r7,Bananaramas,4,Thu Apr 23 16:15:13 2015 UTC,the part of the table where the ladder is would essentially be unusable as a table   why?
RoomPorn,33l1r7,burketo,16,Thu Apr 23 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"Judging by the back of the chair for scale, I'd estimate that table is three and a half feet wide at that point. And because of the floor rise, there is no way to put a chair at the head of the table. The rise I assume is just a step to the table. I picture someone eating a large dinner, and the person coming down the ladder being no where near stepping in the soup  Edit: also, I think it's safe to assume that dinner plate is either 10 or 12 inches for an additional scale"
RoomPorn,33l1r7,Bananaramas,11,Fri Apr 24 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"This is also Japan, though. You know, the nation where the traditional method of eating involves a really short table and no stand-up chairs."

RoomPorn,33jwch,ofNoImportance,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:08:11 2015 UTC,Just any view of buildings would be great
RoomPorn,33jns7,Bananaramas,2,Thu Apr 23 01:34:18 2015 UTC,the one piece of quarter round trim by the left side of the door isn't mitred.. would drive me nuts
RoomPorn,33jns7,Raah1911,2,Thu Apr 23 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Can you explain for someone who doesn't know what that means? What exactly are you looking at, is it the brown trim beside the door? If so what exactly is wrong here?"
RoomPorn,33jns7,macnbloo,2,Sun Apr 26 06:53:47 2015 UTC,yes the brown trim beside the door. Normally you would cut that on a 45 degree angle to 1) look nicer 2) be less of a trip hazard 3) stub your toe less frequently.   I only pointed it out because the woodwork/trim/floor inlay is sooo detailed and amazing its strange such a small thing was omitted.
RoomPorn,33jns7,Raah1911,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:51:59 2015 UTC,"So... Yes. You're completely right. The finish work isn't this places strong point. Not only am I a real estate photographer, I also have an interest in woodworking. It's not hard"

RoomPorn,33cfx0,MeccIt,2,Tue Apr 21 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why someone would opt for that, especially when there's already overhead lighting. I guess the artistic choice was to have everyone's attention drawn to the giant oversized desk lamps."
RoomPorn,33cfx0,fidelitypdx,5,Tue Apr 21 17:21:23 2015 UTC,"Actually it's for having a well lit dinner table. Overhead lighting on 12ft+ ceilings isn't that great for eating a meal. Also, being able to dim the room lights and use the large overheads makes for a more intimate dining experience."

Hope you like carpet, wallpaper, whatever the opposite of open concept is, no garbage disposal in the kitchen sink, power outlets that don't have that third hole, and rooms with harsh lighting from the single overhead light fixture in the center of the ceiling.   When I look at this loft I see a bunch of stuff decades ahead of the houses in my city. Hard floors. No wallpaper. Open-concept. Shelves instead of cabinets. Abundant lighting fixtures plus the big windows. (The only thing this place is missing is an island kitchen.)  I would even wager there's a multi-headed shower in the bathroom."

RoomPorn,33873k,CowsGoMooToo,4,Tue Apr 21 10:42:36 2015 UTC,Thing is it doesn't get to -40C in Britain so double glazing (which the majority of houses have) works just fine
RoomPorn,33873k,Canadian_donut_giver,1 point,Tue Apr 21 11:29:28 2015 UTC,"With our energy costs (being relatively cheap) and our climate not being very cold, double glazing doesn't even make sense financially. Going from single to double will save you £100-200/yr but cost several thousand. The windows will need to be replaced before you save the equivalent on heating.   We install them because they make rooms a lot more comfortable.   Secondary glazing is the way to go really, but it doesn't look as nice.   Also radiators under windows is standard practice because the heat rises into the room and down the other side. Rather than rising and falling and then escaping out of the window."

Myself I have a D5300 with a Nikkor 50mm prime (f/1.8) and sometimes borrow someone's Nikkor 28-300mm (f/3.5-5.6), which is ridiculously heavy.  I was thinking about getting a Nikkor 35mm prime because 50mm can be kinda narrow for some things, and I like primes because they make me think more about my composition, but also when I get used to a certain prime it's easy to take pictures on the go (street photography and the like) because it's easy to guesstimate the frame lines."

RoomPorn,330z77,firstLOL,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:59:11 2015 UTC,"The Meat Book is the only cookery book I have literally sat down and read like a book, rather than dipping in and out to find recipes. His fish one and general one (River Cottage cookbook) are just as good.   His earlier tv shows are better than his more recent ones - in recent times he has concentrated more on the activism side of things (persuading people not to eat factory farm chicken, etc.). It's interesting, but not quite as interesting.  Edit: just to get more meta, the River Cafe cookbook is also excellent."
RoomPorn,330z77,Buddhamama42,2,Sun Apr 19 11:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yes I've read the River Cafe cookbook, but I am definitely a little confused now :) The River Cafe was the one run by those two women who were heavily influenced by Italian cooking ? And the River Cottage is Hugh's thing ?  Edited - yeas - got it, just reread your other comment. Well that's confusing of him. He should have called it ""Hugh's Cafe"" instead, then it wouldn't confuse people :)"
RoomPorn,330z77,ShitfacedCanary,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, River Cafe was Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray (the latter died in 2010). Italian food in Fulham.  River Cottage was the name of the small cottage near Netherbury in Dorset that HFW originally rented when he was working as a food journalist, and where his first River Cottage TV shows were filmed.   After a few years the success of the River Cottage TV shows and books meant that Hugh had outgrown the original River Cottage (and he was only renting it anyway). So he moved to a new ""River Cottage HQ"" near Bridport in Dorset, and then moved again to an even bigger place in Devon. That's where these pictures were taken."
RoomPorn,330z77,zayden2013,2,Sun Apr 19 16:39:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the background :) Isn't it interesting how two people who were passionate about food could bring about so much change - especially influencing Jamie who has moved onto lobbying Governemnts....

RoomPorn,32ydaz,mikeferguson84,19,Fri Apr 17 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"My grandparents on my moms side had tons. Zebra, cheetah, leopard, lion, brown bear, polar bear, and tiger. Those were only the rugs. They gave my Dad an elephant foot trash can which he's had in his home office since I can remember. They shot all these animals back in the 50s, went on a bunch of safaris and my mom told me that my grandfather got paid a couple times to go and hunt troublesome tigers. Not sure how true that story is though. I hate hunting and am not condoning what they did, just sharing. I think it was a status symbol back in the day. I went to a few of my grandparents friends houses in the Beverly Hills area and quite a few had big game displayed.  The only ones my parents kept were the Tiger, leopard and elephant tusks. They aren't really displayed, I think they just remind my mom of her parents. I'll try and find the picture I have of the tiger rug.  http://imgur.com/2YbWj2G"
RoomPorn,32ydaz,TimidTortoise88,35,Sat Apr 18 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"I find hide rugs to be extremely gaudy, morbid, disgusting (dust in the plasticized mouth of a dead animal is revolting), grotesque and in poor taste. I don't even understand how someone can like them for their decorative qualities. I'm sure I'm wrong, but the way I see it, people who like hide rugs and wall-mounted trophies like the idea of being the kind of people who like hide rugs and wall-mounted trophies first and foremost. It's not the least bit classy."

RoomPorn,32ydaz,SkyHawkMkIV,4,Sat Apr 18 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"Well if its real, it was probably bred, raised, and killed in captivity since white tigers don't exist in the wild."
RoomPorn,32ydaz,Gettingbetter,1 point,Sat Apr 18 11:41:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. Trophy hunting in general is something I believe is performed by people with small cocks or an inferiority complex. Fake fur or hide rugs just tends to glamorise the act and numb peoples perspectives of the real stuff. Again, only my opinion."
RoomPorn,32ydaz,mikeferguson84,9,Fri Apr 17 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"Don't have any mounted animals myself (eyes are just as creepy as porcelain dolls IMO). But plenty of people who eat their kills may have personally significant animals mounted, such as their child's first deer. Not my style, but my wall clock made out of computer parts probably isn't theirs either."

Tiger products have been illegal for a long time, and any of the few made a long time ago that remain would not be used as an actual rug. It would cost a fortune and such an old pelt would quickly get ruined.  But yeah, it would be annoying to trip on that fake ugly tiger head anyway."

RoomPorn,32ydaz,Irish_Pinapple7,2,Sat Apr 18 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"Keeping tigers as ""pets"" is pretty restricted and requires at least a permit in every state. That said, I am sure the same rules apply to tigers in zoos and at peoples' homes as tigers in the wild - they cannot be taxidermied or sell parts of their dead bodies. Otherwise there would just be tiger farms and farms with all other sorts of endangered species."

RoomPorn,32x9jq,marvellous,3,Fri Apr 17 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"what I said wasn't wrong.   ...   if anything, appears it would only help weaken it.   Errr - these solid steel tie rods (aka structural tie rods) - not cables - are fulfilling the same role a wooden collar above the roof-joist-line; bracing the roof structure and preventing it from spreading. These are very common in modern construction, and are especially over-engineered in areas where a roof might be subject to heavy snow/ice loading. They absolutely do contribute to the strength of the structure."

RoomPorn,32t4cs,goldandguns,2,Thu Apr 16 23:03:30 2015 UTC,Some wine ages in the bottle and that some is very few. There's this general idea among the public at large that old wine equals good wine and often that simply is not true.

RoomPorn,32t4cs,goldandguns,6,Fri Apr 17 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"No way. Generally wines you see are going to spend 3 months - 2 years tops in barrels - this is largely to impart flavor and varies depending on the wine you're making...new oak will provide much more oak flavor and tannic structure than neutral oak or (especially) stainless and even different coopers will produce subtle differences in the end product. Big, tannic wines like new-world cabernet will spend a good amount of time in barrel, natural wines may be barreled for a shorter time in stainless or concrete, but the end result is that by the time a wine is released to retailers (generally 2-5 years after the vintage) it's been sitting at the winery aging in the bottle for a year or two. At that point, fine wines (aforementioned cabs, bordeaux, burgundy etc) will continue to age nicely in a cellar for decades."

RoomPorn,32t4cs,FECAL_BURNING,4,Thu Apr 16 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to short-term consumption, you're a little bit right - in that as long as wines are kept around room temperature, they will be fine.   If you're talking about long-term storage for aging (i.e.; drinking wines, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80 years) after release, you are absolutely incorrect. Cool temperatures slow the aging curve of wine, so it can develop at the proper pace. If it's kept at room temperature, it will age too quickly and fail to develop many of the tertiary characteristics wine drinkers look for in aged wine. Additionally, many people who have ""older"" cellars with wines that have reached, or are passing, their peaks will store said wines in even colder cellars (low 30F instead of high 50's) to slow down the aging process even further."

Per the other pic in the comments, the furniture is so close to the water that it's impractical for actual swimming. Maybe I'm wrong, having never lived in a space with an indoor body of water, but it's my impression that the pool water will cause mildew and attract bugs as well as being a total PITA to clean and properly maintain - and an improperly maintained swimming pool is really disgusting. It's pretty and this in particular is a beautifully designed living space, but I'm too cold-bloodedly practical to be able to appreciate it fully."

Though the pool area was closed off with windows and doors, the entire building smelled like a pool and my glasses would fog over as soon as I went in.

RoomPorn,32ohip,wontooforate,11,Wed Apr 15 18:24:13 2015 UTC,Ditto. The gym I go to has the same setup he describes (indoor pool closed off with windows) and there´s no humidity or chlorine smell anywhere.

RoomPorn,32ohip,alvisfmk,17,Wed Apr 15 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"No they do not. the water in the pool stays as salt water. ""As salt water travels through the swimming pool’s circulation system, it enters the salt chlorine generator and passes through a salt cell. As the salt water flows through the cell, a low-voltage direct current is applied to flat, rectangular plates inside the cell, initiating electrolysis. Through electrolysis, salt and water break up into hydrogen gas and hypochlorous acid. The hydrogen gas simply leaves the swimming pool water in the form of small bubbles. The hypochlorous acid sanitizes the swimming pool water and ultimately reverts back into salt, and the process repeats."""

RoomPorn,32ohip,BeefPieSoup,23,Wed Apr 15 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"I grew up in one of the wealthiest towns in Massachusetts. My girlfriend's high school was one of the most expensive boarding schools in the world it was over $50k a year a few years ago, I'm sure it's gone up since). Fucking Princesses went to her school. I attended a private school where some of my classmates would vacation via their family's private jet. I grew up thinking we were lower middle class because we only had two houses and would need to rent another for our winter vacations.   Having lived in NYC for the past 8 years, I must say the people looking to buy this property are far different from those in your typical ""rich neighborhood"" suburb most of us might be familiar with. These aren't people living outside their means by trying to impress with a ""huge"" mortgage of $1-3 million and a BMW 7-series or a Maserati in the driveway. I know plenty of people like that. My entire town was mostly made up of people like that. These are people who are putting up $11 million in cash through a shell corporation or trust. This likely isn't even their main property. I also know plenty of people like that. One of my friends specialized in selling homes priced at over $10 million. The people looking to own this home would definitely be able to have someone care for it."
RoomPorn,32ohip,glatts,21,Thu Apr 16 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"You're so right; you just described the difference between affluence and wealth.  It's a reddit thing where everyone believes that people vote aganist their own interests because they belive they are just temporarily embarrassed millionaires, or whatever the Steinbeck quote is.  But I think they vote against their own interest because they don't actually know any wealthy people - they think the people in the rich town with, as you say, the million dollar mortgage and the BMW in the driveway are rich.  But those arent the people who buy influence over state and local government or the people who are able to use their money to create more and more wealth for themselves through unusual investment vehicles unavailable to the rest of us or tax shelters (or sheltered pools - real estate in Manhattan is certainly a commodity)"
RoomPorn,32ohip,notreallyswiss,18,Wed Apr 15 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Chris Rock explained the difference between being rich and being wealthy best:   Shaq is rich.

His standup bit on it is spot on.   I've had the unique privilege of growing up amongst both rich and wealthy families. My father came from nothing, worked his way into MIT and then Texas Instruments and Sun Microsystems before losing it all from poor life decisions. At his best he was pulling in around $300k a year throughout the 90's. Not quite what I'd call rich, but still very comfortable. He blew through a million he had saved for retirement. Although we had multiple cars and houses, we were never over extended. But it's nothing like what my wealthier friends had. The security and influence that wealth brings is unmatched."

RoomPorn,32ohip,EminGH,22,Wed Apr 15 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Turns out he was paying the mortgage for his ghetto mistress's house as well. He had battled with substance abuse (alcohol and cocaine mostly) throughout most of my life. He did a pretty good job of hiding it. Never drank around us, didn't allow alcohol in the house, etc. But every once in a while he would go on a ""business trip"" which would typically be a long weekend bender. When he was upfront about it to my mom, she was ok with it and they tried working on things.   One day he got passed over for a promotion due to nepotism for a very high position at this company that had just recently gone public. His stock options alone would have been worth millions. He was pissed and got hammered only to be caught drunk driving. He hid it from my mom but she found out when the ticket got sent to our home. I believe it also led to him losing his job.   That grew a period of distrust between my parents and they began growing more distant. My dad developed some serious self-loathing and started using again. His behavior become more erratic. He was scary to piss off. He also started cheating on my mom with a bunch of different whores. I don't mean like random single women, I mean like ghetto trashy prostitutes. He really started to throw himself into the gutter. It started to unravel when I was in high school but it got really bad when I left for college and it really messed with my sister. And their problems led to her having to drop out of her private school and go to a public school which increased her feelings of loneliness and desolation.   When I graduated, I came home to work a temporary job at a financial company while I studied for the GRE. On the day of my exam, I remember my mother panicking and asking for help getting this home video to play. Having no idea what that was about since I just woken up, I obliged. The video was a homemade porn he made with this ghetto whore in our living room. Both drinking, doing drugs, etc. My mom was completely frozen then started crying. I left to go take my exams. Luckily got the scores I needed and got in to the school I wanted.   That video and the timing (my sister had started college, my brother was finishing college, and me in grad school, so no kids in the house) led to the divorce. While I was at grad school, my dad and his new girlfriend randomly show up at my doorstep high outta their minds with some bullshit story about how they were visiting her brother in some prison a few hours away. I had a class so they went to my bedroom (it was in a six bedroom house a friend's father bought her for while she was at school) and proceeded to turn it into a fucking crack den in just a few hours. I had to threaten to call the cops just to get them to leave. Place was disgusting and stunk so bad. Turns out during this period, my father cashed out their $1 million retirement fund and spent it all on drugs, booze and partying over a few months.   I have cut him out completely and no longer speak to him. My mom is still a mess. Even though it happened while I was older, it still fucked us all over. I got a job in advertising and my girlfriend worked on Wall Street (she had family problems too) so we just distanced ourselves and created our own world in NYC. Until she broke up with me a few months ago after I had lost my job.  :(  Now I'm off to make it on my own again.  Might have been a bit more than you bargained for, but it was good to get it out there."

My girlfriend's school was on the list but they went with the lower day student cost which is weird since the vast majority of students are boarding students.   Just checked their current annual tuition for boarders and it's over $56k. Some of the people from foreign nations had their parents buy them one bedroom apartments in nearby Boston so they wouldn't always have to be on campus every weekend. There was a girl who would occasionally drive her father's Enzo to school. Some girls (typically princesses) had body guards and detail teams. Place was pretty nuts.
RoomPorn,32ohip,glatts,4,Thu Apr 16 05:23:14 2015 UTC,"Damn, I wish I saw super cars in Boston, and I pass in the Financial District everyday. I reasoned it was the weather, not wealth, that stopped people from buying them.  Anyways, I'm close with a girl who day-student-ed in MA too. Their family's rental income from owning a chunk of Commonwealth Ave. in Back Bay grossed them two million in rental income alone – chump change to her dad's company, which pulled seven billion in investment management. Where does her family live? In a relatively small, 1800s built colonial less than 3000 sqft, where they drive a 2013 528i, and a beat up 4 Runner for their dog. If you'd look at them, you'd see the mother and grandma doing the cooking and  dishes while their loyal dog wags it's tail close by, thinking they were upper-middle class. If you'd talk to them, they were hilarious, but even humbler than their looks. But one thing's missing though – the father. 10 years ago, he left to work in China, living in hotel rooms, looking for success. And everyday he called back home in the morning, just when his wife was about to fall asleep to remind her of his love. What does he do now that he's garnered his net worth of nine-figures? Well...he still lives in hotel rooms lol. He says: well why bother paying for a housemaid and an apartment when I can mark the charge as traveling bill to the company? And 10 years later he still calls back home, visiting every so often to try and meet back the years he's left behind. That's pretty nuts to me."
RoomPorn,32ohip,RennieMackintosh,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:13:29 2015 UTC,"The Enzo belonged to some big time Hollywood producer. I'm not 100% sure where their main residence was, but they could have just picked it up at the nearby Ferrari dealership.   Your description of that family is very spot on (minute the whole husband/father living in hotels). There are many families like that in New England. It was something that was in stark contrast to what I've seen in the NYC area, where many families tend to try and flaunt more."
RoomPorn,32ohip,glatts,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:43:16 2015 UTC,"Once the father needed cholesterol meds (genetics), so his doctor prescribed a generic alternative to Lipitor. He asked for Lipitor because of its ubiquity, only to come to the pharmacy, see the price, and called back his doctor for the generic prescription instead. I've always thought that was hilarious.   For the hotel thing, he has some Hyatt membership with the amount of travel points on his black card, and the company foots most of the bill. But, he stays in the same suites in the hotel, not unlike in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Except lonelier. Since I'm good with her family, they've been enormously good to me. Once coincidentally nearing my birthday, I said I needed to buy a new car to the daughter, and they said they would help – in the sense of buying me a new car, a model even better than their own. I totally disagreed, but they did so anyways filling half the registration for me.  I don't think the concept of wealth and status really excites them anymore (they're only mid 40s). Their definition of success is...taking smart risks, and rewarding the other world instead of themselves, because they know they've made it. They just have to keep it. I honestly envy them to no end."

RoomPorn,32ohip,TwatsThat,5,Thu Apr 16 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"The pool smell that you're thinking of is a sign of an improperly kept pool. If you follow the proper care guidelines for a pool and don't have too high of a bather load then you won't get that smell. I'm also sure that anyone who can afford this place could also have afforded to put in a proper ventilation system so there's no humidity build up which would also provide a decent buffer in terms of pool smell as well.   Things getting wet from splashing or generally just using the pool is still very likely except for the fact that, in my experience, people who have things like this don't actually use them and it's more there as a decoration/status symbol."
RoomPorn,32ohip,UnicornBones,3,Wed Apr 15 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"right, I always tell people that if a pool smells like chlorine then either the water hasn't been changed in forever or the chemicals are not properly taken care of. caring for a pool has made it near impossible for me to want to swim at public pools, they can be way dirtier than you think."

RoomPorn,32ohip,jabalabadooba,42,Thu Apr 16 09:58:00 2015 UTC,A great big room that smells like chlorine? No.
RoomPorn,32ohip,Eslader,42,Wed Apr 15 19:10:58 2015 UTC,Is there really THAT much chlorine needed when the pool is indoor?
RoomPorn,32ohip,TwatsThat,29,Wed Apr 15 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Dunno why you got downvoted, it's a legitimate question.  Indoor/outdoor does not matter when it comes to chlorine, only chlorine stabilizer. The chlorine kills bacteria in the water. You need that no matter where the water is because every time you climb in the pool you are introducing bacteria to the water, and without chlorine in there it will multiply quickly, especially since the water is heated.   The chlorine stabilizer helps prevent sunlight from breaking down the chlorine, so you don't need it if the pool is indoors.   There are other things you can do to reduce the need for chlorine - special filters, etc, but you'll always need some (or a chlorine equivalent, and all of them smell).  I suspect the biggest problem here actually isn't the chlorine smell. It's the water vapor. That pool is going to make the whole room humid. Humid rooms mean moisture settling on solid surfaces.   The room is gonna be a giant petri dish if they aren't very strict about keeping things clean, and chlorinating the pool won't help because the chlorine will break down over time, which means the moisture deposits won't have any bacteria fighting properties. That will be bad enough on the glasses in the bar area, but that nice porous brick on the opposite wall is going to be loads of fun if they haven't sealed it and don't keep it clean routinely."
RoomPorn,32ohip,kerowack,3,Wed Apr 15 15:33:44 2015 UTC,Salt water pool would solve some problems.
RoomPorn,32ohip,TwatsThat,7,Wed Apr 15 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"Some, but saltwater creates problems of its own and still wouldn't address everything in the room getting damp."
RoomPorn,32ohip,falcon_jabb,2,Wed Apr 15 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't solve any of those problems actually. Salt water pools are still chlorine pools it's just that instead of adding chlorine in a granular, liquid, or tablet form there's a cell plumbed into the system that uses creates chlorine from the salt water as it passes through. The benefits of this are that you have a constant, low level stream of chlorine any time the pump is running which helps to reduce peaks and valleys in the chlorine concentration in the pool. Since, as far as water condition is concerned, the longer you run the pump the better this can be very beneficial if you're willing to run your pump 24/7 as you'll have a constant stream of chlorine and constant circulation which then reduces or eliminates your need for certain other chemicals, like chlorine stabilizer.   Edit: also even though a salt water pool is much lower concentration of salt than ocean water, salt water is still corrosive to many materials and can cause real problems with certain materials so putting them indoors is not always a good idea."
RoomPorn,32ohip,emperormark,6,Wed Apr 15 17:52:37 2015 UTC,I don't know but I can anecdotally add that I know a family that bought a house with a basement indoor pool a good 20 years ago and immediately filled it in and made an actual basement out of the room.  The entire house still smells like indoor pool today.
RoomPorn,32ohip,YourNotAngryNeighbor,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/eslader said.  The strong chlorine smell you get from pools is generally and indication that your bather load is too high, you're over chlorinating your pool, you're not properly cleaning or filtering your pool, or some combination of those. Even if you don't want to put the work in to reduce or eliminate this smell there are ventilation systems that you can put in place that essentially suck up the air immediately above the water surface so humidity and all but the worst odors are vented outside. These are usually used in commercial applications but I'm guessing whoever owns this place can afford one."

RoomPorn,32kaso,Quicksilver_Johny,7,Tue Apr 14 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"This just does not coincide with experiences my search for apartments. Trulia's median rental price/bedroom in Dogpatch is around $2800-$3000 (map image), so that's less than 30% market rate (although, I think they're including super-expensive one-bedrooms in that as well).  Anyway, I was legitimately confused, because $2500/room is itself pretty cheap. But um, if you know of rooms downtown for $1000 a month... send me a PM."
RoomPorn,32kaso,busydoinnothin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your best bet is to come here and scour CL aggressively and meet people who move in/out rent controlled spots. I  have a friend in a 5 room place in Lower Haight and all the roommates are paying like 800-900. As of now, the easiest/cheapest place to find a one bedroom for 1200-1300 is the Tenderloin.

RoomPorn,32kaso,Quicksilver_Johny,3,Tue Apr 14 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did a lot of scouring CL before I moved. In a nice $3000 3bdr in Ingleside, lease up in a couple months. I looked real hard around Potrero Hill/Dogpatch/etc. My ex-girlfriend has a 3.5 bedroom, 5-6 person warehouse-loft in Dogpatch for $7000-something. Sadly, not rent-controlled. I'll have to keep an eye out for rooms in Western Addition/the Haight.  I'd probably commute from Oakland or Emeryville before living in the Tenderloin or Bayview..."

RoomPorn,32gj24,onlysame1,56,Mon Apr 13 16:48:55 2015 UTC,That is called a Barrel Vault or Pitched Brick.
RoomPorn,32gj24,SnarkyFartBlast,-12,Mon Apr 13 17:28:54 2015 UTC,I think this is a clear case of catalan vault.
RoomPorn,32gj24,arojilla,9,Mon Apr 13 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"Catalan Vault is where the brick is layed lengthwise (long section) along with the curve.  And, as seen in your picture, the Catalan Vault is shallow.    In the original post, we can see the brick is layed short-section with the curve, and a much deeper pronounced curve, that would not normally be called a catalan vault.  Barrel Vault is a more apt descriptor, but I think barrel vault is a more general term.  In other words, you could have a lengthwise laid barrel vault."
RoomPorn,32gj24,Higgz,-5,Mon Apr 13 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"Which one is my picture?  Anyway, I don't know that much about architecture, but I know where I'm from, how we construct and how we call things. And for me that is a volta catalana no matter what."
RoomPorn,32gj24,arojilla,2,Mon Apr 13 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"The picture you provided in your first post is a shallow, lengthwise catalan vault.    The sencond one you just posted is more similar to the original post in construction, but much shallower.  I dont mind all of them being called catalan vault, or all of them called barrel vault, but traditionally, the catalan vault has a shallower hollow area and the barrel vault is a deeper hollow area.    I mean, what stops a maker of many catalan vaults from just making a deeper hollow area than the first ones, right?  Catalan and barrel vaults are just arched brick construction."
RoomPorn,32gj24,Higgz,3,Mon Apr 13 21:22:20 2015 UTC,"You are right in that they are both brick arches, and that the volta catalana tends to be shallower. But just tends. We call it that way (volta catalana, bóveda catalana) no matter the arch as long as bricks are layered ""flat"" or horizontal, by their smaller sides. In contrast to pitched brick vaults (bóveda de ladrillo), where bricks lay vertical, by their larger sides. Which is the traditional construction in Spain's south/west. It's just a way to differentiate both. As they are the same but different.  BTW, the house I grew up, and later my mom's house too, have pitched brick vaults, and my uncle/aunt's has catalan vault. And they all are lovely."
RoomPorn,32gj24,arojilla,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:03:46 2015 UTC,Well they sound gorgeous!
RoomPorn,32gj24,Higgz,2,Mon Apr 13 23:23:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply but this is a Barrel Vault ceiling.   Also doing an image search of Barrel Vault ceilings you get these.
RoomPorn,32gj24,SnarkyFartBlast,3,Mon Apr 13 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, because both are pitched brick vaults, you get both types in that search. But search for catalan vault or volta catalana and you'll see it's a distinctive work (flat/horizontal bricks vs vertical). I don't think it's wrong to call a catalan vault a barrel vault, but a catalan vault is a thing. You may as well call them ceilings."
RoomPorn,32gj24,arojilla,22,Mon Apr 13 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"My mom's fiance's dad owns a really old bank/ post office of a little town in Nebraska, and the vault's ceiling looks like this. He converted the place into a cheap little apartment, and the bathroom is the old vault room, which has a vaulted ceiling. I asked why he made the bathroom in the vault, and in his old Vietnam veteran New Yorker voice, answered ""so ya can leeve yah depahsit"""

RoomPorn,32gj24,ameliakristina,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Notice the rough texture of the walls; this is called rustication and it contrasts with the smooth ceiling.    In classical architecture[1] rustication is an architectural feature that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished, squared-block masonry surfaces called ashlar. Rusticated masonry is usually squared off but left with a more or less rough outer surface and wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block. Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above."

Photography wise there are only two places you are allowed to photograph, being the outside and the main hall itself.  Basically the reason is that everything in the main hall is owned by the National Trust but the stuff in the other rooms isn't.  You can go into the other rooms, you just can't photograph them.  Still well worth seeing. :)"

Having a shower in Japan is a bit different, you normally sit on a stool and fill the bucket with water and clean yourself with a cloth. I'm sure there's some variation to it, but that's what I did when I lived there."
RoomPorn,32bso5,swantwan,3,Sun Apr 12 18:18:57 2015 UTC,It's a traditional arrangement.  It's meant to be filled and used to clean oneself before entering the bath.

There's a lot of outdoor activity and because of the culture of the Island, there's a feeling of safety.  Even the biggest city has a small town atmosphere.  Not to say that every place you go is safe--just like any where you will have places you want to avoid.  I did move to New York about 7 years ago but only because I wanted the chance of living in a truly ""Big City.""  But i will probably go back there to live once I'm older."

RoomPorn,323y7c,DrShadyBusiness,19,Fri Apr 10 17:03:14 2015 UTC,how much would a place with a view like this set you back??
RoomPorn,323y7c,patientbearr,28,Fri Apr 10 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the rest of the apartment, but let's just say it's a 1 bedroom with a view like that on the west side of Manhattan... at least $2500/month, probably more  edit: more like $4k/month at the minimum"
RoomPorn,323y7c,cacophonousdrunkard,82,Fri Apr 10 17:26:04 2015 UTC,That's a very very very low estimate.
RoomPorn,323y7c,patientbearr,9,Fri Apr 10 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"No I agree, I was putting that as the absolute minimum.  Probably more like five or six grand a month, if not more"
RoomPorn,323y7c,sprucenoose,13,Fri Apr 10 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"Plus, the apartments with those views are rarely small 1 bedroom affairs. Those are the high end, larger apartments with prices to match."
RoomPorn,323y7c,tidderreddittidderre,16,Fri Apr 10 18:46:04 2015 UTC,$2500 is what you'd pay for a studio/one bedroom without a view in west Manhattan. The view jacks it up an absurd amount.
RoomPorn,323y7c,PM_ME_UR_SIDEBOOOB,7,Fri Apr 10 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"I live in an expensive part of southern California. $2,500/month will barely get you a 1 bedroom apartment here, and Manhatten has even higher prices. No way could you get a view like this for anywhere close to that estimate.   Edit: I see your edit, that price sounds more realistic."
RoomPorn,323y7c,Victawr,6,Fri Apr 10 19:26:04 2015 UTC,Lol $2500/month gets you a studio on a lower floor in the Tenderloin in SF.

RoomPorn,323y7c,Victawr,8,Fri Apr 10 17:41:54 2015 UTC,No seriously fuck the Bay Area. Its about $900/mo to live in a livingroom in sunnyvale...

RoomPorn,323y7c,algalkin,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:43:29 2015 UTC,Seattle - probably 1 or 2 bedroom with the sound and mountains view for around $2500

RoomPorn,323y7c,vadarpoo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:28:48 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was thinking! I rent a crappy 1 br for $1600 in silval but could easily afford a nicer spot (even a sweet studio) for about the same price in Brooklyn.
RoomPorn,323y7c,piemeister,5,Fri Apr 10 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much. Where's Silval?  It's because NYC still has the boroughs and really good public transportation to get into work in Manhattan. BART is a piece of shit as is the rest of public transit here (looking at you, CalTrain). And the only places left to expand to have gotten prohibitively expensive (Oakland near BART, or..anywhere near BART)."
RoomPorn,323y7c,vadarpoo,2,Sat Apr 11 00:04:14 2015 UTC,Silicon Valley lol I think just my dorky company calls it that.  And seriously on the public transportation! I was in ny a few weeks ago and was amazed how many places you could reach so easily. Most of the bart stops are not points of interest for anybody and there aren't enough lines
RoomPorn,323y7c,piemeister,4,Sat Apr 11 00:26:03 2015 UTC,"Ahhh yes, I usually just refer to it as the south bay or as the valley. Silval is pretty obvious though, I should've figured that out lol.  But..please tell me where you found a 1BR in the valley for $1600? Did you use PadMapper? I am struggling to find anything decent for < $2000, but admittedly haven't done a lot of leg work yet."
RoomPorn,323y7c,vadarpoo,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:27:43 2015 UTC,Yep! Pad mapper all day. I'm not in a great area (north SJ) but it gets the job done. My rent was just increased so I've been looking for a new spot but can't find anything decent under 1600 either!

RoomPorn,31zlml,rabbitvinyl,6,Thu Apr 9 19:05:44 2015 UTC,The window could be north or south facing letting in very little direct light. The placement of the wine storage in correlation to the big window is also as such to where the bottles shouldn't be hit by direct UV light.   There's also the possibility that they have UV protective glass on the cellar.
RoomPorn,31zlml,keanex,-1,Thu Apr 9 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"I dont see much sunlight entering, besides who says it's long term storage?"
RoomPorn,31zlml,mack-the-knife,15,Thu Apr 9 15:29:30 2015 UTC,There is a shit-ton of sunlight in the photo. Why would anyone build a temperature-controlled wine room for anything other than long-term storage? You leave the bottles you're planning to drink within a week in the kitchen.  Don't be obtuse.
RoomPorn,31zlml,holymadness,-11,Thu Apr 9 15:32:12 2015 UTC,"That's not direct sunlight.  I have a wine fridge in my kitchen with around 100 bottles that are ready to drink now. I would use such a room instead.   My guess is that you know next to nothing about wine, but then again you think I'm obtuse, so let's hope we are both wrong."
RoomPorn,31zlml,mack-the-knife,4,Thu Apr 9 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for wine, but with beer, it's not direct sunlight that matters (although direct sunlight is worse), it's any kind of light at all. Even beers in stores with just fluorescent light succumb to light degradation.   Now, with beer, light causes the oil from hops to degrade until it gives off a skunky aroma. Skunked beer is basically just spoiled hops due to light exposure.   I know nothing about wine, but if it had any chemicals in it that reacted like hop oils do, any light would be bad for it in the long run, not just direct sunlight. Keep in mind, this is for long term storage and aging, but most people wouldn't go through the trouble of temperature control without the idea of long term storage."
RoomPorn,31zlml,carboy_coat,7,Thu Apr 9 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"This is not the same with wine.  It's the UV rays that harm wine if exposed for a long time. It attacks the tannin in the wine and can ""age"" it prematurely.   I don't suspect many UV rays to enter that cellar from where the window are placed.  I can't answer for the rest of the world, but here in Denmark it´s quite common to have a wine fridge for wines that doesn't need storage, but just to keep them at serving temperature.  Don't know why I get downvoted."
RoomPorn,31zlml,mack-the-knife,3,Thu Apr 9 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"You're being downvoted because youre trying to create an unnecessarily pedantic discussion and have basically said anyone who disagree knows nothing about wine.  Im a trained sommelier and can tell you direct or refracted, ALL UV from sunlight will degrade wine.   UV rays dont just disappear outside of direct sunlight, theyre refracted everywhere that is illuminated."
RoomPorn,31zlml,nickh93,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well you are surely free to your interpretation on what I´m saying, but the only one I have stated to know nothing about wine is holymadness. The one who said the the owner of this house know nothing about wine, and that I'm obtuse for not agreeing with him...  I also have explained my view, and as I see your view doesn't differ from mine, as you are saying the exact same thing as I am.   The only thing left to discuss is whether or not UV rays enter that room, which I don't think it does in any significant amount. This is also only relevant if this room is for long term storage which I claim  doesn't have to be the case depending on drinking habits.   So unless you also, besides being a sommelier, also is an expert in entering and reflection of UV rays on surfaces within house, this discussion is leading nowhere.   I'm off to drink some wine ;)"

RoomPorn,31zlml,fernando_69,3,Wed Apr 22 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"Then it actually is the same as beer, because it's the UV that affects the hops in beer.  Also, no, not much UV will get to them compared to direct sunlight, but it's still being exposed to UV if it's being exposed to light at all.   The point is really just for long term storage. If you're talking about a wine fridge rather than a wine cellar, you probably don't keep wine as long as it would matter to expose it to some indirect light. The picture here though, is an extremely large 'cellar' area that is definitely going to store wine for a long time unless the owner is a raging alcoholic or has a way-too-oversized wine storage area.  You got downvoted because people disagree with you, even though they shouldn't downvote for that."
RoomPorn,31zlml,carboy_coat,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"False. UV rays are what skunks beer. Light doesn't hurt it unless it's putting off UV rays, which many lights do, just in such small portions that it's negligible."
RoomPorn,31zlml,keanex,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:07:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't think sunlight contains UV rays you're delusional, I said 'light' rather than UV rays because, as you said, most sources of light contain UV rays so it's basically irrelevant to be so specific, but if you really want to shame me, look down in the comment thread where I mention UV rays causing the degradation."
RoomPorn,31zlml,carboy_coat,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"How much UV rays is proportional to the degradation to the quality of wine though? Because there are certain types of windows that reduce both U-value and SHGC, meaning a reduction in thermal transmittance and UV radiation."
RoomPorn,31zlml,netgod2002,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:14:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as I said, I don't know much about wine, but with beer, it doesn't take much. There is a noticeable increase in the rate of degradation of beer even if it's just under artificial light. If you were to pour an IPA into a clear glass and take it outside, within minutes (if you have a low taste threshold for it) you would taste the skunky off flavor.  The reason beer takes longer to degrade in a bottle rather than a glass is because of the brown glass, it blocks a lot of the damaging rays (but not all of them). Green and clear glass let the most damaging light through, and that happens to be what most wine bottles are."

I would like to take the time to point out why I don't like it, because there are a lot of great elements here that simply do not blend well.  The sofa and chair, while beautiful, are not quite fitted to the space simply because of their shape. Sofa is too long/narrow, the chair is just a red angular object in a space made of angular objects.  The rug is amazing, IMHO. Low pile rugs are great, and that pattern/color is something I would buy. The floor is also lovely. Sadly, the floor, rug and the rest of this room were never meant to coexist.  ""But why not?"" You ask. Simple, the room itself (when you get the furniture and everything out) was already designed to be a showpiece. It's got a very specific mod/masculine feel to it. It's grown up, classy. Like a James Bond suit.  ... and that makes the punk theme somebody put down in here the Dior T-shirt. Yes, it's an expensive high-end T-shirt... but James Bond still wouldn't wear it with a suit.  Edit/It's 12:35 in the morning and I'm a sleep deprived freelance artist on a deadline. Also, I feel legitimate sympathy for that rug.  Second Edit/ I just saw the design painted on the walls... which now remind me of a cubed hamster ball. (Anybody else see the resemblance? Look at those slats!)"

RoomPorn,31mk8b,kar86,15,Tue Apr 7 08:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had the same question which is why I put some extra reading in my comment:   Christian Boros, the owner of a German advertising agency, and his wife, Karen Lohmann, an art historian, were looking for a singular space in Berlin—both for living and exhibiting their vast contemporary-art collection—when they discovered an old five-story bunker in the central neighborhood of Mitte. The bunker had been built in 1942 as an air-raid shelter for residents of the area. ""It was what we wanted: something really interesting from a historical point of view,"" Lohmann recalls.  In 1945, the building was converted into a prison. After the war, it became a warehouse, first for textiles and then for produce. Since then, the property had undergone various reincarnations: a nightclub, a nonprofit organization, and an exhibition hall—until the couple bought it in 2003."

RoomPorn,31mk8b,pattyfritters,8,Mon Apr 6 17:35:16 2015 UTC,Seems the entire five story building was the air raid shelter.  Just not underground.
RoomPorn,31mk8b,Malzbier,3,Mon Apr 6 17:38:02 2015 UTC,Not all bunkers are huge underground facilities. There are very many overground shelters (so called Hochbunker) left. Much easier and cheaper to build. Many are still around because they are for some reason quite diffiult to destroy.

RoomPorn,31mk8b,TommBomBadil,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:52:35 2015 UTC,I think the 600M2 is just for the the penthouse-units on top.  The link from fiffle there shows the interior to be museum space.

If you're thinking of buying them, make sure you're buying them for aesthetics, not for lighting. They don't put off much light but don't burn your eyes looking at them. I only got them because the floor lamp is one of those long, extended, over hanging ones and is over my bed. (Hopefully I explained that correctly!)  My sister's house has probably 50 of these, (none with a shade) and it is DARK at night! Even when they're all turned on. It looks hazy imo   Edit: this is not my lamp but similar design.

Can't tell without being in the room, but it would also probably be very loud to fill the tank after a flush, unless they have it set to fill very slowly."

RoomPorn,3157ml,Rolten,2,Fri Apr 3 03:01:56 2015 UTC,Wealthy people don't buy things because they use them all the time. When they buy real estate it is like a trophy and a convenience thing. If he ever wants to throw a pool party he can. Also real estate is an investment so the nicer the property (and the more amenities) the easier it will be to sell at a later date.

It's a 5 story townhouse with an indoor pool on the first floor.  I'm basically obsessed with it and can't imagine how awesome it would be to live there.  I actually walked by last time I was in NYC and they front door was open for some sort of work they were doing inside. I was so badly tempted to just wander in and look like I knew what I was doing so I could get a peek of the place in person.  Google it when you get a chance, there's pictures on every floor.  I know Beyoncé filmed a music video there and I think someone else did.  You can rent the place out for some ungodly amount of money I can't remember."

I was really surprised the first time I learnt about it, but when you think about it, this way they won't have the need for the constant repelent and the bats won't be a problem for neither humans nor the valuables."

My aunt/uncle have a huge set like this, they are popular classics bound/themed in matching leather and uniform size. They do contain words. Personally, I prefer a more organic style.  Or these are just old law texts. In any case, I doubt that they are simply empty volumes."

RoomPorn,30d3k6,stop_the_broats,10,Fri Mar 27 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"An architectural trend I noticed a lot of in Australia is the fluidity between indoor and outdoor spaces.  I noticed a lot of ""outdoor rooms"", covered patios, sunrooms, etc.  I also noticed a lot of jalousie windows that were open to the air, where in the states we'd have a solid window and a screen. Overall I really liked the architecture I saw in Aus and NZ.  Everything felt relaxed and homey."
RoomPorn,30d3k6,Jexium,6,Thu Mar 26 19:03:50 2015 UTC,"Part of that is just because Australia has the climate to take full advantage of outdoor space almost year round. Also until recently we tended to build our houses on quite large blocks, meaning you could have a deck or patio without sacrificing a garden. Nowadays were building bigger houses on smaller blocks but they still have patios because people expect it, but most new houses have little to no garden."

I was a bit off. 37.5k not including tax or installation. I will scan it in and post it after I get my actual work done. My previous order had to be custom molded as the customer needed less than 30"" panels to fit the opening properly. I am aware I did a bad job of obscuring my work place.

RoomPorn,30d3k6,Jexium,20,Thu Mar 26 15:35:49 2015 UTC,Having worked in construction in Australia I'm extremely dubious about the 50k claim for a 6 panel patio door system but I never had to purchase one of these so I don't know enough to dispute it.
RoomPorn,30d3k6,Ilubalu,6,Thu Mar 26 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"Can't really tell if it is six panel, that style of door has two or one side and up to 6 or so on the other side, it can cover up to 20ft or so before you hit the custom mark. My experience is with the Jeldwen Aurora IWP folding door system."
RoomPorn,30d3k6,enosprologue,4,Thu Mar 26 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"To prove it could cost 50k, why not include a link to a retailer's web page on which they're selling that? I could find the manufacturer's page, but as we all know, there will be no retail pricing there."
RoomPorn,30d3k6,ke1c4m,2,Thu Mar 26 19:10:02 2015 UTC,Seconded. There is no way it cost that much. Bi-/tri-fold doors are very common here in mid-range houses and small businesses like cafes. There are timber ones from DoorsPlus from AUD$5000.

RoomPorn,308ypj,tomdarch,6,Wed Mar 25 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"It almost certainly is not a High Dynamic Range image (where multiple bracketed exposures across a wider range of light to dark are shot and then blended in a computer.)  If it was High Dynamic Range, there would be more detail in the dark shadows and more detail in the bright areas like the windows.  Rather a local contrast enhancement filter has been used.  You absolutely can produce HDR images that don't use local contrast enhancement - but they tend to look ""flat"" and low contrast because we are used to seeing moderately bright things blow out to white and moderately dark things get lost in black shadows, so simply mapping a wider dynamic range to a standard dynamic range (computer display or print) produces a ""flat"" low-contrast image.  TL;DR: Not fucking HDR!  Local contrast enhancement! Quit calling everything with that look HDR!"

Apparently up to 55% of pied-a-tierres are vacant most of the year and there's a lot of talk about taxing the ultra-wealthy who aren't there most of the year, but I wonder if that will really do anything."
RoomPorn,3049vz,purafolha,40,Tue Mar 24 15:47:15 2015 UTC,These people have more money than they know what to do with. They will pay any price for a vacation home in New York. So why not tax them? they will still buy the homes. If you can afford $25 Million for an apartment that you don't live in an additional million will not prevent you for buying in Manhattan.

RoomPorn,3049vz,alickstee,3,Tue Mar 24 17:07:24 2015 UTC,It's probably less vacation home and more investment. There's problems in London with builders mostly sticking with ultra luxury properties which takes away housing from others and increases rents. I'm betting manhattan isn't so different.
RoomPorn,3049vz,HotDogFest09,2,Tue Mar 24 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"Ummm, do they not already pay property tax? Why would we tax them even more just because they're not around to use it all the time?"
RoomPorn,3049vz,alickstee,14,Tue Mar 24 19:49:19 2015 UTC,Because it is essentially speculation. There is nobody occupying these places and their ownership reduces the supply without also reducing demand. This increases the price of the market as a whole. To counteract the negative impact of this behavior there should be a disincentive to the speculator and a benefit to those who are harmed residential owners.
RoomPorn,3049vz,HotDogFest09,-1,Tue Mar 24 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so how is taxing them going to create more housing? Like you guys said, an extra tax isn't likely going to discourage people from buying these pied-a-terres, and it's not like there's tons of new land to be developed on in Manhattan. So it might reduce the price of the market as a whole, but it doesn't really fix the problem of limited housing. Does it?  I'll be the first to admit I know nothing about real estate in NYC."
RoomPorn,3049vz,alickstee,14,Tue Mar 24 20:13:01 2015 UTC,It depends on what the goal is. You could use the additional money to reduce everyone else's property tax making residential ownership relatively cheaper. Essentially forcing this group of people to pay a higher burden of taxes. So it won't create more housing but it will make housing relatively more affordable. Or instead of reducing taxes you can use the money to give tax breaks to medium income housing developers.
RoomPorn,3049vz,alickstee,11,Tue Mar 24 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think I understand. I appreciate you sharing this perspective with me."
RoomPorn,3049vz,danvasquez29,2,Tue Mar 24 20:39:47 2015 UTC,Use the money to build more houses in New York. That way there is a larger supply of houses and people can actually afford to live there.

RoomPorn,3049vz,daned,3,Tue Mar 24 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"they're constantly redeveloping lots. Currently, because of the influx of ultrawealthy individuals from overseas, if you're a developer looking to turn the 4 lots of chinese restaurant/bodega/shitty apartment building/newstand you just bought into a modern highrise, there's is a huge incentive to make it an ultra-luxury high end development with 3000sqft ""residences"" that will sell quickly and for absurd amounts.   What they're talking about is giving incentive for that developer to build 30 1000sqft apartments instead of 10 3000sqft apartments."
RoomPorn,3049vz,flacciddick,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot more room to build in other boroughs besides Manhattan but most would prefer to build in Manhattan because it's the wealthiest.

RoomPorn,3049vz,Evertonia,13,Wed Mar 25 04:43:45 2015 UTC,It's especially bad in London. Increasing real estate prices has made it so foreigners buy more than just 1 home and sit on it.

RoomPorn,3049vz,lilleulv,5,Tue Mar 24 16:05:07 2015 UTC,I would be in favor of this tax if the money was used to build more apartments for people in the 5 figure range to live in.

RoomPorn,3049vz,daileyjd,7,Tue Mar 24 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think growing up in a big artist's loft in NYC was, like, ""enough"" (and it is)... but then I see spaces like this and I realize that our building (while amazing, don't get me wrong) was also old and funky, in need of repair, and definitely not the kind of place someone who lived HERE would set foot in. It's just funny that there's such extreme stratification within physical spaces that are (at least in theory) comparable. Like an unheated cement-floored building in Bushwick, vs this."

I saw one bookshelf post where literally everyone in the topic essentially told the OP that everything he read was shit because he had some mass market novels and manga/trade paperbacks. Yeesh. I honestly didn't expect the majority of /r/bookshelf (the subreddit that declares ""Have books? Show 'em!"") to be so focused on criticizing people's tastes. But, that's Reddit, I suppose.  I love seeing bookshelves organized by color (because, y'know, there's function and there's aesthetics), and every single post I saw where someone had done that got blasted pretty hard for not alphabetizing or using the dewey decimal system or something. I guess I'm not the right audience for ""/r/bookshelf"" but I don't often revisit books in my library very often, so having it displayed in a way that I can enjoy SEEING every single day would always outweigh worrying about having the books in alphabetical order or cataloged in some way that I can absolutely find the book in 3 seconds flat (after I fire up my database software and this and that and the other). Besides, isn't browsing for a book a great way to rediscover forgotten loves? Good grief."

RoomPorn,2zsxwy,mkraft,385,Sat Mar 21 13:29:51 2015 UTC,That's more like an empty common-room with two portable hoops set up. Never really seen a true indoor court built with a chandelier and several large glass windows bordering the court.  Still gorgeous room though.
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,_aP,122,Sat Mar 21 14:57:45 2015 UTC,not to mention those are some of the cheapest portable hoops you can buy
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,SantiagoAndDunbar,27,Sat Mar 21 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Someone spent $3 million on the damn house, then decided it'd be a great idea to buy some hoops off of Craigslist for $25."

RoomPorn,2zsxwy,JoeStapes,8,Sat Mar 21 22:45:54 2015 UTC,unacceptable lol
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,SantiagoAndDunbar,4,Sat Mar 21 23:15:28 2015 UTC,What's the difference between cheap portable hoops and regular hoops other than I guess not being able to do your crazy dunks that would bring it down?
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,twfu,45,Sat Mar 21 15:43:46 2015 UTC,That and stability. The backboard material is plastic and not glass. The rims aren't professional grade. Also pretty sure that backboard has a smaller surface area
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,SantiagoAndDunbar,20,Sat Mar 21 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the shock absorption level of cheaper portable systems can affect the characteristics of the hoop and backboard thereby changing your shooting arc, banking angles, and rebounding positions. I don't know whether there are varying levels of fine-tuning among pro/semi-pro systems, but I assume there are still regulated parameters that must be met."

RoomPorn,2zsxwy,Fat_Dietitian,11,Sat Mar 21 23:37:43 2015 UTC,That kitchen is nowhere near nice enough for a 2.6 million dollar home.
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,DwelveDeeper,6,Sat Mar 21 16:06:09 2015 UTC,One of my best friends grew up in a 6-7000 square foot home and the kitchen was probably the smallest room (minus the bathrooms) in the house! Whenever I'd eat there it was always takeout food  And I just remembered the fruit bowl in the kitchen was filled with plastic fruit. It was so strange to me
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,vivereloud,2,Sat Mar 21 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"I live in a big home too (big family) and our kitchen is quite small too. Granted, its an open concept type thing but in comparison to the tv room its about half the size."
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,DwelveDeeper,2,Sat Mar 21 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"That's the same for me! I'm one of 5 kids so we grew up in a large house too. Our kitchen is less than half the size of our family room but our middle floor (where the kitchen is at) has no inclosed rooms and looks over the family room (bottom level) It does make the kitchen seem a lot bigger.   But my friend's house was so weird. Every single room in the house was enclosed, even the kitchen. It was basically how you'd imagine an old lady house: busy wall paper/ extremely cluttered with knick knacks/ and very gaudy. I remember the first day I went over to his house I got lost in the house and called him to find me because I didn't want to open the wrong door. I swear there were like 30 rooms in that place. None of which were very big"
RoomPorn,2zsxwy,vivereloud,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"I think in this case you're paying more for the pool/gym, location and the absolutely massive yard.   I agree, I think the whole kitchen/dining room/ living room is pretty blah but you do get a LOT for that 2.6 million. You also get an extra kitchenette outside the basketball court thing. So I dunno, I think it's a fair price for how much you get. Just far too colonial looking for my taste..."

The people who work there at Pacific Domes are very friendly and helpful. They're able to accommodate custom designs (where you want the windows, liners, etc).  If we were to have ordered a dome, it would've been through them because they were well established (a lot of people use them) and proved trustworthy by the amount of thought they put into weatherizing and keeping it structurally sound against snow and your custom design.   If you're looking for a long-lasting shelter, I'd say it's probably worth it. Although, I recall that there is a lifespan on the canvas and they aren't cheap or easy to replace."

First is Sand by Hugh Howey (the 'omnibus' has all 3 books included)  And then a fan wrote a sequel called Dunes over Danvar (again this 'omnibus' includes all the parts).

The platform of the Moscow subway station pictured here has 68 limestone-and-marble pillars rising from a granite floor. Lining its sunflower-yellow ceiling are glittering mosaic panels decorated with smalt (cobalt glass ground into pigment) and precious stones, each mural paying tribute to a historic Russian military triumph. A decade after Stalin—and such opulence—had fallen out of favor, his images in two panels were removed, and the party line turned to ""kilometers at the expense of architecture,"" an ideology favoring function over form.

RoomPorn,2z30lj,konnektion,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:10:36 2015 UTC,"According to the Sotheby's web site, asking price was $1,998,000."
RoomPorn,2z30lj,manicakes1,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"I would guess around 2 million. Not more than 3 million and not less than 1.5 million.   Talking Canadian dollars here so multiply everything by 0.8.   Montreal is very expensive for such a small, cold, and heavily taxed city."
RoomPorn,2z30lj,AllDaveAllDay,2,Sun Mar 15 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"Does it have anything to do with the fact that it's an island, and therefore has no room for expansion?   And I'm curious what you mean by small. It's metro area has a population just under 4 million. While that's not exactly New York sized, it's definitely big enough to create an expensive real estate market."
RoomPorn,2z30lj,furtive,8,Sun Mar 15 13:57:25 2015 UTC,"Prices on the island are higher than the surrounding areas, but ask anyone who lives there and I doubt they'd say they are paying more because it's an island (neighbouring Nuns' Island would be a different story).  It's so big that you don't think of it as an island except when you take a bridge, most people don't live anywhere near shoreline.    The quote that ""Montreal is very expensive..."" is misleading in several ways, the average house price in Montreal is 60% less than in Vancouver, 45% less than in Toronto, and 30% less than Calgary. It's also not a small city, it's the second biggest in Canada, there are 1.6m in Montreal proper, 3.8m when including surrounding area.  Finally, as for foreign ownership, 6.9% of downtown Montreal and Nuns' Island is foreign owned, while only 1.5% of condos are foreign owned. Considering Montreal as a whole, and how international it is to begin with, that doesn't seem that crazy, it's a far cry from London's 20%."
RoomPorn,2z30lj,manicakes1,2,Sun Mar 15 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"Good questions. The city itself is quite small in population density terms, as the island is huge, a significant portion of which are suburbs.   The real estate situation is a problem in all Canadian metro areas. The real estate market has been fueled by a mix of low interest rates, oil wealth, and foreign investment (a big chunk of the market is wealthy Chinese and middle easterners who pay cash).   We also never experienced the real estate collapse of 2008/2009 in the USA. Mostly because we avoided risky mortgage products. However, some argue our situation in Canada is now worse than it was in the USA circa 2008 because our personal debt to income ratio is higher than it was in the states then."

RoomPorn,2z0u73,trooper843,76,Sat Mar 14 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"I have such a shower, and I do not recommend it.  Reasons: - Scale. Have to clean every few days, otherwise some of the nozzles close, or worse, close partially, leading to water being sprayed far away from the shower area. - Since the water is flowing slowly, it takes longer for hot water to arrive. - The water cools down a lot while falling from a high ceiling. The difference is very noticable. So you need hotter water and create a lot more steam. Which leads to other problems with the moisture. - Not easily repairable.  That said, I find it slightly more pleasant to use. Also, you usually install a hand shower in addition."
RoomPorn,2z0u73,knipknap,22,Sat Mar 14 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"After reading through the comments I'm surprised by how much people dislike this shower.  The open bathroom system is kind of lousy, I agree, but the several hotels I've stayed at with these showers usually have them encased in a shower stand, so the steam/moisture/wet room problems are a lot more isolated.  Unless your bathroom ceiling is ungodly high, temperature has never been a problem, and your point about water flowing slowly is more dependent on the particular shower you have installed than anything.  Also TIL people can't clean their assholes properly unless they have water shooting straight at their stink."

Iron ions may also be removed during softening. The best way to soften water is to use a water softener unit and connect it directly to the water supply."

From the first moment that I drunkenly stumbled into the shower at Marriott hotel (they were expecting me) I was miserable.  To be fair, it did not end at the terribly misguided shower, but I was miserable in a ""hot tub"" that was cold as shit the whole time. Even though I pressed the button at least fourteen times only cold water spewed from the jets."
RoomPorn,2z0u73,TheHaleStorm,18,Sun Mar 15 07:24:07 2015 UTC,"I can see the bit about water in your face, but I call bullshit on this. It's not uncommon in parts of Europe and Asia to have your shower in a so-called Wet Room, where there is no curtain and the entire room can get wet. I assure you, there is no problem with temperature. I can't explain why, necessarily, but I've used both; I know the phenomenon to which you refer, and yet have never experienced anything but warm wonderfulness in wet room showers."

One that comes in at a 45 degree angle, and one that points straight down. We can have both or either one on at the same time. If I'm washing my body, I'll just use the angled head. If I'm washing my hair or just de-stressing in a hot shower, I'll use both heads at the same time to increase waterflow. It works pretty well imho"

RoomPorn,2z0u73,Delaser,8,Sat Mar 14 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"Not really,  Let's do some thinking.  The initial setup for this would be quite expensive, as it's not a standard bathroom. It would require the room to be built to suit. So you have the money to build a house or addition.  It's not practical at all for children to use, not to mention it appears to be in the same room as the bed, so either you have poor judgement, or no kids. No kids usually means disposable income. OR you have a secondary bathroom. Which, combined with already fancy bathroom, suggests money.  Now, add this to the fact that you can hire cleaners for as little as ~$50/day/house, it's entirely believable that you could hire someone to clean just your shower."

But the fact that it's an extremely different shade of wood (compared to the cabinets, which I really like - the colour of the barrel window thing is odd, and too glossy, and its existence is altogether kinda pointless...) is rather jarring.  If the dresser were sanded and refinished to match the rest of the room, it would be really nice. I have to admit this is one of those rooms that I wouldn't expect to like based on its elements, but the combined aesthetic is nice. I initially thought the grey tile was stone brick (I can't prove it's not, but it's got that glossy glazed look of ceramic that I don't like).  I'm not a massive fan of the white marble.

The woodwork is a totally different style, the handles don't go with the kitchen, and the finish doesn't fit.

RoomPorn,2z0s2j,zkiller195,11,Sat Mar 14 21:31:06 2015 UTC,If you are going to place something there it should be a smallish table or something. An open area would be much better there. At least in this know-nothing's opinion.
RoomPorn,2z0s2j,BackOff_ImAScientist,5,Sat Mar 14 19:15:46 2015 UTC,I'd put a utility surface like a butcher block counter or maybe a nice heat resistant counter for cooling and/or rolling out things for candy making.

The original example I said doesn't really work, cause using a sweater to make a backpack is more or less just recycling the fabric. However, using bottle caps to make the buttons would be upcycling the caps."

RoomPorn,2z0s2j,GreenBrain,6,Sat Mar 14 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"Up-cycling isn't a word. So no it doesn't mean that. Everything you described falls under three different words: reduce, reuse, or recycle. Using bottle caps to make buttons is reusing. Taking bottle caps and turning the plastic into buttons is recycling.   I disagree that upcycle means anything."
RoomPorn,2z0s2j,boothin,-2,Sat Mar 14 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"Upcycling is essentially a fancy word for altering something to reuse it. Using a plastic water bottle over and over again would be reusing. Altering it so you can smoke out of it would be more like upcycling. Just because you prefer other words, doesn't it mean the word stops meaning anything."
RoomPorn,2z0s2j,TeCuervo,4,Sat Mar 14 17:58:35 2015 UTC,I didn't say I preferred other words. I said I don't think upcycle is a word.   Maybe it will continue being more and more popular and I'll eat my words.

RoomPorn,2z0mu0,poirotoro,2,Sat Mar 14 17:01:01 2015 UTC,I'm the photographer. The end of the hallway is in Golden ratio with the high side. This is a canonical composition. In addition is coerent with the rotation of the floor design. A perfect simmetry is not possible
RoomPorn,2z0mu0,kc8,2,Sat Mar 14 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thanks for the reply; your photo is lovely. :) I'm hoping you can explain a little further why symmetry is impossible, unless you are saying that the plan is not perpendicular (i.e., not a perfect rectangle), or the walls are of different heights.  To my eye, the arches in your photo (which I understand are elliptical and not perfect half-circles) looks somewhat warped because it appears the camera is turned slightly to the left. This image, where the camera's focal plane is perfectly parallel to the end wall, shows the arches as symmetrical.  I understand, however, that classical architects often used visual tricks to make an asymmetric or irregular room appear symmetrical. If that's the case I'm very curious as to what is actually happening with the geometry."

Your legs have to be bent at an angle, and then your upper body has to be bent over the table for balance. Then you have to do a sideways shuffle while in this awkward position. So, yes, getting in and out would be a pain. And it offers no advantage over a standard table and set of chairs where you simply back up and out without bothering anyone."

That includes solid mahogany construction, insulated and coated glass (laminated isn't really needed unless required for storm protection), plus stepped, double gasketed profiles with multi-point locking, and a whole bunch of other custom goodies.  NanaWall is pretty decent for commercial applications, but leaves a lot to be desired in a residential setting. Especially if you're looking for Leeds/Passivhaus certifications, or want it to match existing details.  *Edit: We also have screens and shades that can roll or fold into either side of the unit so it doesn't become a bug haven or exhibition hall, and is hidden away when not in use."

RoomPorn,2yoo3s,monkeyhitman,2,Wed Mar 11 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"If you can watch the video I posted in a previous comment, there are mounts for rollers on the top and bottom of the sash, right near the center of the unit. These rollers are inset to the tracks to keep the door operating properly. Otherwise, the sash are linked to one another by hinges.  Our products are custom built to order entirely in America, and we like to use certified or reclaimed lumber. This means that we don't have a warehouse full of ready made units, and our labor and material costs are high.   However, this also means that each step of the process can be customized to the client, and we are able to deliver a higher quality product. We've had some really neat projects simply because other companies aren't as flexible.  If you have any questions, I'm usually logged in."
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,anon72c,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm in the market to buy a home within the next 20-25 months, and this type of door entry/exit towards a backyard is very appealing. Originally I had the idea of doing wide French doors, similar to a meld of French door and Barn door. Laminate came to mind because accidents happen and why not? Can these types of doors be one way reflect tinted? I'm not sure what the correct term is, but the type that makes it a little difficult to peek inside?"
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,U3011,2,Wed Mar 11 22:13:48 2015 UTC,"Newer compositions of tempered glass are pretty resilient, won't break into nasty jagged shards, and are more cost effective than laminated. It's also easier to tint or coat a single piece of glass than it is a laminated one.   We've used low reflection, one way glass before. It does better with birds and other animals than traditional tinted or mirrored offerings."

A 12-foot opening with 4 ea. 3-ft. doors was about $14K IIRC.  The only catch is that they're primarily hung to take the weight as it allows them to operate more easily vs. rolling on the lower track.  As a result, you need HEAVY beams above to take the load.  I think we used 3 large LVL's.  So depending on what you're doing, you may have some structural work to do."

RoomPorn,2yoo3s,Zbignich,6,Sat Mar 14 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"So, just having doors on hinges along a track costs a lot?"
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,Elgar17,13,Sat Mar 14 15:08:32 2015 UTC,"it's more involved in that.  For one, these are usually expensive french style doors to start with, not the cheap front doors you can buy at Menards.  Then a lot of the hardware has to be heavy duty because well built doors with large windows (usually double or triple paned for insulation) are heavy.  You also have some customization involved in making sure they seal solidly when closed so they don't just leak air all the time, since you're replacing 9 - 28' of wall depending on how many you use.  Lastly, these are almost always partial custom jobs with changes made for each individual site condition.  It all adds up pretty quickly.  If you like the look but want to save some money, I recommend doing a row of sliding doors that can pocket out of view.  It won't be exactly the same, but it should be a good bit cheaper I think."
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,PostPostModernism,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:21:55 2015 UTC,How are these doors made to be air tight? I'm assuming they aren't just big gaps of insulation where all the cold comes in.
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,Amazinglagann,2,Wed Mar 11 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"I was curious too so I looked through their cut sheets real quick.  It's worth noting first that yes they absolutely are big gaps in the insulation - as are any doors and windows.  These are especially bad because they're usually used in large applications of 4+ doors in a row, otherwise you're not really getting much benefit over just double french doors.  For insulation - they offer multi-pane glazing options which can raise the R-value of glass system significantly (though not really to the realm of a wall usually).  It looks like in some of their applications they have available thermally broken systems.  I'm looking at this from the P.O.V. of the aluminum door frames, and what they do is have another material (which I've forgotten the name of while reading further) which acts as a separator between inside aluminum and out.    For air penetration, it looks like they use the same kind of defenses most other doors would use.  In the closed position their side framing locks together and seals with rubber gaskets and the top framing at the track locks into the track.  At the bottom track they use two layers of brush-type weather stripping, which isn't perfect.  They also have an optional raised sill to help with water penetration in situations where that may be a problem, which also looks like it would help with air.  But I think that would be avoided if possible because flush sill tracks are sexy.  Either way, the company I was looking at (Nanawall) definitely claims to meet the federal minimum requirements for air penetration.  When it comes down to it, this kind of product isn't typically for someone who is going to worry about moderately elevated energy bills.  Either because they have the money that it's not an issue, or because they live in a climate where they want to keep their house open as much as possible anyways."

RoomPorn,2yoo3s,ProfessorPaulKrugman,10,Sat Mar 14 18:23:36 2015 UTC,NanaWall   Don't forget the structural engineer costs if you are removing a large section of wall! Chances are there are load bearing points along such a large space. Oh then there's the relocation of any plumbing/electrical.

RoomPorn,2yoo3s,ProfessorPaulKrugman,9,Wed Mar 11 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"Which requires the SE to sign off on the design for the construction permits ;)   Best of luck with it, those wall systems are awesome. I've only seen them in commercial applications but they are really cool and can be opened/closed by a single person."
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,bazrkr,5,Wed Mar 11 19:14:02 2015 UTC,Permits?  What are those? ;)
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,ProfessorPaulKrugman,9,Wed Mar 11 19:20:36 2015 UTC,It's only a matter of time until some angry Canadian dude named Holmes starts yelling at all the previous contractors that visited your house ;)
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,bazrkr,2,Wed Mar 11 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, nice"
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,ProfessorPaulKrugman,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain the permit process for homes? You ask if you can build something somewhere in your house, an added room, and they tell you if it's legal for the city regulations? Does an HOA have any say in this kind of stuff?"
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,WhitePantherXP,2,Wed Mar 11 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"Completely dependant on the local laws for what you need. Most places require permits for any structural changes, adding a room or removing a wall as long as theres no load bearing structure within it you'll probably be ok. The other tricky part is any electrical and plumbing work most certainly requires at least some permits to be pulled.  If you have an HOA, you will need to see what their rules are. Sometimes they might be simple ""don't paint your house pink"" rules, but other times they may have restrictions on when contractors can work and where they can park.   Above all else, you cannot trust a contractor to do their due diligence with regards to permits, that is stuff you will need to request information about from the local municipality. It's also good knowledge to have when judging which contractor to pick, because if they don't know about what permits they need to pull- what else could they not know about?"

RoomPorn,2yoo3s,Fupup,2,Wed Mar 11 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought as I have a Wheatie, but the ears and tail are too long. I think the other comment, that it's a sheepdog, is closer."
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,squidzilla,4,Wed Mar 11 20:38:51 2015 UTC,Maybe a bearded collie?
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,Fupup,2,Wed Mar 11 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"I just looked up the differences between the Old English Sheepdog and the Bearded Collie and it looks like you are right. The sheepdog has a docked tail and doesn't come in this fawn color, whereas the collie has both the long tail and the fawn color. Either way, we can probably all agree that this dog is super cute!"
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,squidzilla,2,Wed Mar 11 18:48:54 2015 UTC,Whoo! My useless and vaguely encyclopedic knowledge of dog breeds finally came in handy.
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,scissorman,3,Wed Mar 11 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, OES are no longer having the docked tail as it has been found to be better for their health.  Source: I have two Old English Sheepdogs with tails and one with a docked tail. Two to UK standard and one with a US mix.  The brown in the coat is allowed within the American breed standard, it is the UK standard that has the pure blue merle colour as the appropriate standard but due to health concerns with the breed, many breeders are crossing US ones with the brown coat tinge with the UK ones.  This makes it harder to tell but going from the size, stance, colour transition and the head shape - it looks closer to an OES to me."
RoomPorn,2yoo3s,KestrelLowing,2,Wed Mar 11 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after looking at it again, probably not a wheaten.  Honestly, I didn't even see the rear half of the dog when I first glanced at it!  I thought the dog was sitting down!"

They can climb up the side of the house and open an unlocked window.  They can find your badly hidden spare key and just walk right in.  They can bump the lock, or pick the lock with a $20 lock pick gun and walk right in.  These doors will not make the security of your house any better or worse.

RoomPorn,2yp29o,Ashenfenix,2,Wed Mar 11 17:41:31 2015 UTC,Is it the staff and/or the food.  Because that atmosphere is chilling.
RoomPorn,2yp29o,Scratch_Card,4,Thu Mar 12 10:03:07 2015 UTC,"The place is called 'Ristorante Grotta Palazzese' a seaside restaurant that specializes in sea food in Polignano a Mare Italy. The views are great, but in essence it is a known tourist trap, a real shithole.  The atmosphere and views are stunning, if you are able to get a table reserved in time. The service is incredibly rude and uninterested (even if addressed in italian) and the food is bland, overcooked or cold, pretentious and overpriced (even if the location is taken into account).  The place has build a reputation on raving reviews from celebrity parties catered by top chefs, but those are not the cooks you will find in the kitchen during your visit. If you want some nice pics, visit before opening hours, when the cleaning crew will let you on the terrace if you tip them 10 euros."

One minor quibble though, it's not solid wood. The wall at the back is obviously veneer over ply/mdf, look at the grain in the consectutive veneers. The treads are likely not veneered (it wouldn't stand up to the wear), but are probably solid lumber around an engineered core (maybe solid ply or MDF, or a torsion box setup). It's possible they're solid 12/4 lumber with an end cap (I'm assuming to hide the cable hardware)."

RoomPorn,2yc63w,I_got_nothin_,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:48:18 2015 UTC,Aaaah. And I'm sure the aging populous doesn't help in that regard. Few people marrying. More people losing sexual interest in others. Aging populous. I can see why marriage rates are down.
RoomPorn,2yc63w,velders01,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"The reasons for it are similar to what's happening in the rest of the world. It's not so much about lack of interest in the opposite sex, but that the younger generation simply don't have access to the same # of good jobs as their parents and grandparents did.   This is especially pronounced in Japan, where working multiple part-time jobs (arubaito) are considered preferable to living a corporate lifestyle where you work 12-14 hours a day earning meagre wages.. ya know.. japanese salaryman lifestyle. At least in Japan and Korea, you would be considered irresponsible if you came to the marriage ""poor."" You should already have saved up at least for a small place, some furniture, etc... Now that even that's becoming a difficult task for many, the marriage/childbirth #'s are plummeting alongside increasing cost of living, especially pronounced in education costs starting from kindergarten."

RoomPorn,2y51wi,snorting_dandelions,2,Fri Mar 6 22:58:33 2015 UTC,I was sold up until that last picture of the outside. Looks really ugly in my opinion. Still an amazing penthouse nonetheless but that's super underwhelming compared to the inside.
RoomPorn,2y51wi,jaundicedave,18,Fri Mar 6 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's a HDR image. Interior design, architecture, and property people use it all the time. A camera sensor does not have the dynamic range to capture dark areas (inside the penthouse) and light areas (outside the windows). So multiple photos have to be taken and combined. This actually makes the lighting much more natural when done correctly because the human eye has a much higher dynamic range than a camera sensor.   I think the reason it looks off is because there's an insanely huge amount of chromatic aberrations which makes the whole image look like one of those old 3d pictures."
RoomPorn,2y51wi,SantiagoAndDunbar,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:15:42 2015 UTC,"I thought that too. I would've thought that the exposure would make the windows be too bright to see anything out of.  It's not a render, but maybe they took a few pictures and combined them somehow? I'm fairly sure that's possible."
RoomPorn,2y51wi,GermanAggie,7,Fri Mar 6 17:49:49 2015 UTC,What you refer to is HDR(High Dynamic Range imaging) and this picture would be a prime example on when and how to use it correctly.
RoomPorn,2y51wi,imjustjk,4,Fri Mar 6 17:07:06 2015 UTC,this is not only possible but is definitely how this was achieved. i've done some work with architectural photographers and multiple exposures are key to getting everything visible and well-exposed. it's pretty trivial to shoot many images and combine them in photoshop as long as the camera is on a tripod so that the images line up exactly.
RoomPorn,2y51wi,SexLiesAndExercise,2,Fri Mar 6 17:32:04 2015 UTC,very common to take multiple exposures for interior/real estate photography
RoomPorn,2y51wi,SpiffySpacemanSpiff,2,Fri Mar 6 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah its not to hard in Photoshop, I've done some render backgrounds that way too"
RoomPorn,2y51wi,Jagrafess,8,Fri Mar 6 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"Serious question: international investors are flocking all over manhattan buying $10MM+ apartments (sometimes up to $100MM) as bank accounts in the sky.  Why hasn't one of those investors bought this place yet? It's been on the market for years now.  With as unique as this place is and the accelerating rate of real estate prices in Brooklyn, wouldn't this make for as good, if not better, investment for some of those people?  Why do they only buy in limited areas around Park ave, etc?"
RoomPorn,2y51wi,SpiffySpacemanSpiff,16,Fri Mar 6 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Because as you say, they buy them as investments - safe spots for their money that will either hold or increase value. The fact that this has been on the market for so long suggests it's priced too high, and they wouldn't necessarily be able to sell at the same price, let alone turn a profit. When you're buying for confidence, you don't buy something no one else is confident in.  The time it has taken to sell implies it may take just as long to sell, and therefore also represents a very illiquid asset when compared to other investments (even other property)."
RoomPorn,2y51wi,urbangentlman,17,Fri Mar 6 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"If I can add to this, an overwhelming amount of investors (especially in New York) are foreign purchasers moving money out of their home country and parking it in real estate. This is dont for a whole swath of reasons, one of which is that forcing a sale of property is traditionally more difficult than ordering a bank account be liquidated.  As to why people dont put money in Brooklyn,  well they are! It's just a question as to where. Williamsburg, Long Island City, and areas in Park Slope, Cobble Hill and the Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center are being developed (in some cases tremendously) and the rents and property values are JUMPING.  But are those areas the sort that foreign investors purchase in? Not really. People look at Manhattan and know two things: 1. the infrastructure in the city is as good as it's ever going to be, and, 2. due to it's finite size, real estate cant be developed elsewhere to lessen the value of their neighborhood.   Brooklyn is a bit trickier. Because Brooklyn (and every other borough to a lesser extend) is somewhat endless, by comparison to manhattan, neighborhood development is not as ""rare,"" and the value of being in Manhattan doesnt exist. The property investors I work with are developing in brooklyn, but not in Williamsburg or the areas listed above. Why? Because the land is already overpriced, and, because overpriced land isnt really worth it.   I could go on for ages about this jazz, but the above represents my two cents."
RoomPorn,2y51wi,musicguy2341,4,Fri Mar 6 20:37:07 2015 UTC,Please do go on! This is interesting.
RoomPorn,2y51wi,simonjp,3,Fri Mar 6 21:34:15 2015 UTC,"Where to start?  I mean at the top of the list is the idea that Mnahattan investments are infallible. I'm inclined to believe that this is bullshit. I mean hell, look at the financial district. I have a few friends and clients who put money into that neighborhood in 2007. Their flats are in the red. Why? Because FIDI, while in Manhattan, is a relatively boring place. It's connected to every major line of transportation, yes, but it is lacking in a nightlife. Oh, and since one hasnt developed/taken off, there's not much of a desire to live there. Paradoxically, look at dodgy neighborhoods up in the Bronx (think south Bronx) where a flat is CHEAP, because it's still fairly unsafe (sorry to those residents I may have offended). The bronx is seeing the beginning of the gentrification trickle, and the space there is prime to be invested in.   This is especially true in the south bronx (and also areas off Atlantic, past Franklin in BK) where the buildings are pre war, meaning they're developed with larger ceilings, and more grandiose, albeit in need of a power washing, facades. Those areas are just in need of a police presence and a good cleaning. The buildings need a good once over, and the investment is riskier, but the reward is, in my opinion, going to be a better bet in the long run, as opposed to a flat in the Village (either one). For one, you'll be getting a lot more space, in a more sturdy building, for less price and with a higher likelihood of noticeable value increase. OH and add to that that you can buy into HDFC's which are insanely cheap, albeit with a bitch of a flip tax if sold too early, and which can be used to generate a huge return over the long run. Shit I once did a sale in a Manhattan HDFC (or some iteration, I cant recall the program name) where the purchaser had purchased 15 years prior to the sale for a few grand, but sold for 650K. 20% flip tax on that sale was steep, but they netted a 400K+ gain in fifteen years. Those opportunities do NOT exist in Manhattan anymore, but they do elsewhere in the right spots of the outer boroughs.   Perfect example of Manhattan's value stagnation is Grammercy Park. I've done a few transactions there, and each, without fail was for at least over a million. Each building was old and decrepit, and the unit owners were either millionaires or very old folks. The buildings had shit in reserves, and no flip taxes to build them up. But people still bought them. They were wasting their money on an already expensive property that would only marginally go up. That same money could have bought a BUILDING in a decent place in Bk, with change left over for renovations. They could quadruple their investment, but they didnt."

RoomPorn,2y1noh,MrD3a7h,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:23:40 2015 UTC,Modern is a design aesthetic.   Adaptive reuse is new construction in old facilities.   People use reclaimed materials in new construction.   these reasons are why words are important when discussing design.

RoomPorn,2xzmqb,syspig,10,Thu Mar 5 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"They're fun, because they occasionally allow access to very unique places that otherwise wouldn't be available without significant expense and design compromises.  We're in the middle of designing a custom home, and we'll have something very similar to this. There will be a huge open room, with 20' ceilings and views out the front . Small loft via circular staircase to the rear, sharing the view out the front. Conventional stairs would take up way more space than we have available.  Yes, moving large items up there is an issue. However, it's not something done routinely and not terribly difficult to solve. We'll have a section of railing that's removable, and bring up a temporary block/pulley when needed."

RoomPorn,2xsmw5,Draxagon,23,Tue Mar 3 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely stunning. Beyond stunning, in fact. That view alone is jaw droppingly gorgeous. :) I'm glad to have seen this post with the video link as well. The only problem, however, is that I fear I will never, ever have access to something this amazing. I simply am not in and don't seem to be moving in the direction of a field that will ever accumulate enough wealth to make a home like this possible. But further, even if I magically COULD make that much money, I fear that I'd have SO much responsibility that I wouldn't even be able to enjoy coming home - I'd just come home and flop exhausted to the bed and just sleep through any amount of time I'd spend at home. Oh well. But it sure is pretty to look at and dream about. :)"
RoomPorn,2xsmw5,vampire_kitty,3,Tue Mar 3 22:15:35 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of hotels in Sydney with nice views - it's a great place to visit! I know I'm missing the point, but science shows that people who go on plenty of holidays (even little ones) are much happier. Bottom line: live in a shit shack and take beautiful holidays!"
RoomPorn,2xsmw5,Sytadel,2,Wed Mar 4 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"The only problem, however, is that I fear I will never, ever have access to something this amazing.   That's a public city, with public streets, a public memorial, and a public church. None of what you're seeing, none of what makes that photo stunning, belongs to anyone. Whoever owns that apartment may get to think they own all that, but it belongs to the Australian people and the visitors we choose to share it with.  I've lain in the freshly cut grass there. I've read a book and looked back up at the apartments there, and wondered who might be standing inside by themselves, looking down at the beautiful view I am a part of."
RoomPorn,2xsmw5,vampire_kitty,3,Wed Mar 4 11:26:29 2015 UTC,"What you say is true of the view alone, however, I was speaking in terms of the housing itself more than just the view it includes. :)"

RoomPorn,2xt7vc,DaAvalon,7,Wed Mar 4 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, the weather is actually pretty nice during summer. When we have almost never-ending days, nights are extremely short and bright, and we spend most of the day's hours awake and outside.  It may be slightly less warm during spring and fall, but we just wear clothes or use blankets. Many of us also own patio heaters designed for this purpose. This is typical for our street side cafés and restaurants"

It was done by a studio called Valkyrie based in Bangkok, and it was made for local bathroom furnishings company Lavenz to showcase their products in their catalogue. I'm sure the city outside is probably a stock photo - couldn't say which one it is without some serious research. If you really wanted to know the city, knowing that this penthouse is CGI and doesn't exist, you could try posting to /r/whereisthis. We're pretty good at that sort of thing.  Also, I should mention that even though the photo is CGI, not all of it necessarily is. Some things like the bathtub and toilet might be actual photos composited into the rest of the scene.  EDIT: After a quick search, that's the Taksin Bridge in Bangkok out the window. Here's a view taken from the same vantage point (a nearby hotel)."

They always Photoshop an image onto the screen in these projector setups because the image would look shit otherwise, as it would in real life until you turned the lights off and closed the curtains (the ones that aren't installed, for the sake of a minimal but highly impractical aesthetic.) This is what it looks like without Photoshop, and that white shade on the screen is as dark as the black parts of the projected image get."

I might be in the minority,  but the black shelves, black balcony, black fence, wire, and staircase seem to absorb all the energy out of the white/off-white/beige/brown color scheme. I think the idea is great, but only if they could maybe blend the silhouette of the balcony and stairs better with the overall feel of the room, maybe light wood and wire fencing and white bookcases.  Not to mention the black squares underneath the balcony are a different size from the white ones on the ceiling -- it feels like it wants to be the same but is ultimately mismatch and distracting."
RoomPorn,2x4337,RennieMackintosh,14,Wed Feb 25 17:51:29 2015 UTC,I feel like a light brown or an eggshell would work way better.
RoomPorn,2x4337,purplepippin,11,Wed Feb 25 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"No, I can see that. Ideally it would all blend in in white/off-white tones, but the overall look of it is stunning."

RoomPorn,2x4337,fidelitypdx,0,Wed Feb 25 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"Libraries offer other services and programs that make them useful.  Additionally, lots of libraries loan electronic versions of books - which instead of having to return them, will simply remove itself from your device on the due date.  They can be renewed online as well.  It's a lot simpler then dealing with the physical copy.  And yes, most books should be electronic.  It's environmentally friendly and it consumes less space and resources.    There is no good reason to hold onto books today -"

Lambing season means placenta and blood and goop there by the wood stove, so does kidding. I live alone and there aren't any kids, so it really isn't a worry.

RoomPorn,2wzj7r,wicked_sustain,3,Tue Feb 24 15:39:06 2015 UTC,I think this hall was used by Henry VIII for entertaining Anne Boleyn. Strangely enough Dover Castle was considered so big and important that nothing really important happened except an unsuccessful siege when some barons invited King Louis of France to come replace King John. It was one of the castles built to defend England against French invasions which never really occurred.  Dover castle was more important in WWII as most of the Dunkirk evacuations were organised from tunnels built under it. It was front line during the battle of Britain and a hospital for pilots shot down over the channel was also in those tunnels.  Source: Many many School field trips.

I'd love to see something similar but maybe on a rooftop ? If there's a window on top of it, similar to the opening on the right it would be perfect for stargazing as well. I'm not sure why they didn't expand the glass door and ad a window to the right, it would provide more usable space, make the office bigger and you would have a window. Maybe it's meant for outdoor storage (to put a bike or something) but then there's still the hole in the ceiling. Either way i really like it."

Also, pigeons and gulls. It's a nice idea, but that skylight is going to either be awful to look at or a pain to clean."
RoomPorn,2wkhx1,letsgocrazy,6,Fri Feb 20 20:52:55 2015 UTC,You'd think. But I've put in horizontal rooflights on properties in London and they look great - it rains so much here that it washes itself clean.

RoomPorn,2wkhx1,Tustiel,2,Fri Feb 20 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"They don't collect water - since they're flat the water runs evenly off to the edges. So far, my standard details is to leave a 4-6mm slot around the perimeter of the glass, which has a 100mm x 100mm channel underneath, connecting into the main drainage system. If it hits a vertical obstruction, typically we punch through a few 15mm PVC pipes. It works quite well. These are the ones I usually specify, although typically I'm putting down stone slabs around them, not timber decking."

RoomPorn,2wjl86,SexistButterfly,6,Fri Feb 20 17:10:00 2015 UTC,What is the proper way to use HDR. ELI5
RoomPorn,2wjl86,ZachMatthews,14,Fri Feb 20 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"HDR stands for high dynamic range, which is the difference between the dark and the light areas in a picture.   Camera's have a hard time capturing scenes that have a lot of contrast (Difference between the light and the dark areas) by virtue of how the settings alter the final image. You have to choose to either expose for the dark areas, sometimes over blowing the highlights or expose for the highlights which leaves out most of the details in the shadows.   Proper HDR takes usually three images. One under exposed, one over and one ""correctly"" and combines them to get the graduated field that you see in ""proper HDR"" Most often used in landscapes and architecture due to the complexity of the scene.  Shitty HDR like this takes every thing too far. When you combine the images together there is a multitude of settings and sliders you can pull around that can fuck with your image. Making the image too contrasty or saturated is a common mistake.   tl;dr Proper HDR shouldn't be noticed. Its a subtle photographic technique that smooths the image."
RoomPorn,2wjl86,mattcoady,6,Fri Feb 20 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"You can actually manufacture the effect without necessarily taking three shots and still have it come out nice.  It just takes some work.  I did a blog post for a friend's blog about it a few years back:  http://www.photographybay.com/2008/04/08/how-to-single-image-hdr/  The absolute key and I am serious here is not to over do it.  Most of the objectionable HDR shots you see online happen because the exposure is being adjusted uniformly on sections that need it and sections that don't, resulting in ugly ghosting that looks like you're watching an image after pressing your eyeballs for too long."
RoomPorn,2wjl86,SexistButterfly,3,Fri Feb 20 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Also, shooting in Raw mode will give your file a little extra light information in both directions."
RoomPorn,2wjl86,large-farva,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Camera's are definitely getting better at being able to capture a large dynamic rage, but true HDR is hard to beat.   Pull the shadows up and highlights down is just basic post-processing."

Replace that usage of the word ""put"" with ""hide,"" and that's probably more reflective of your lifestyle, and the exact difference between you and a minimalist."

RoomPorn,2wfzm3,nickerodeo,12,Thu Feb 19 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"I work in architectural design services, and our fee is roughly 10-15% of the cost for equipment and labor.  A $1M job would be roughly $100-150k in design fees for our trade.  I believe most architects follow suit, with about 8-15% fee of the total cost of construction."

RoomPorn,2wfzm3,agentdarko,3,Fri Feb 20 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"Well not exactly - I am in the audiovisual design field, so I can't say how a mill worker would base their pricing.  We have to provide a proposal to the architect based on a scope of work, so we merely estimate our design fee based on how much work it will take to complete drawings, specifications, etc through the various phases.  It just so happens that most of our proposal fees would equal roughly 10-15% of the installed price of the equipment we specify.  We've had fees anywhere from a few thousand dollars to well over $100k for a single project - percentage wise, it would be anywhere from as low as maybe 5% of the installed price to upwards of 20%."

So if she's already good, I suppose it's possible that she just wants the view (or it was already like that when she bought the place). Maybe it was a reading room for a previous owner. But then again, it looks like the rest of the home and the other building to the right have lots of window space. Personally, I'd love to have that much window space but I like minimalist rooms."

Honestly I've only had one of my teachers use the mirror method when I was learning violin, and I outright refused to use it for viola and cello.  It doesn't help enough to make up for how awkward it is and how it trains you to rely on your eyes instead of focusing on your body position and how it feels to play the instrument."

Not being able to see outside from the desk would be a feature for me, not a bug.

RoomPorn,2w6s6u,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,28,Tue Feb 17 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"This comment is made every time there is a room with books on this sub.   -There are two step stools ready to use.   -The room seems to be on the shorter spectrum, so most of those books are eye height and are probably easy to reach by most adults.   -If someone was just going to buy books for show, they would be a lot more aesthetically pleasing than these. The rest of the house is meticulous, yet the books are haphazard and random.   -Why would someone build a room specifically for reading if they never read? As people have said, the view from the desk isn't great. The view is only from the couches, where there isn't a table to eat off of or to play games or do homework. It also seems to be a private room, not their public living room. So I'm going to assume they really like reading and aren't trying to impress people.   -Who even cares? It's still a cool room and I would love to read a book in it. I don't really like the pillow fabric, though."

RoomPorn,2w6s6u,Rand0mtask,13,Tue Feb 17 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that guy, but: ""made due"" should be ""made do"" (seriously I'm not saying that to be a dick, just letting you know)  Also, I would guess that the books aren't filling the shelves because it seems a bit more relaxed and calm this way. It echoes the haphazard view out the window, which makes a nice contrast with the straight lines of most of the rest of the room. The pillows are another relaxing, non-straight element."
RoomPorn,2w6s6u,fyeah,3,Tue Feb 17 16:34:56 2015 UTC,Wow. Made do... I don't like that one bit. Made due doesn't make much sense either. English is evil.

For example:   Chemical Principles General Chemistry Molecular Driving Forces Organic Chemistry Quantum Chemistry   or   Signals and Systems Discrete-Time Signal Processing Digital Image Processing A First Course in Wavelets with Fourier Analysis   If it's your own book collection, it would be easy to group and organize your books like this."

Not to mention, not everyone has or needs a strict system of classification, especially when there are only a few hundred books.

I'm kind of surprised they allow them. I've never bothered to go take pictures at the flower garden in Maryland because they ban tripods and unless you're going alone you have to apply in advance for a photography permit. I figured that sort of policy was just something all flower gardens did."

The bookshelves above the windows are incredibly impractical and would never be used. The lamps (I think they're lamps?) on either side of the bed are too far away to turn off when you're lying in bed. The table/chairs arrangement makes getting to the far side of the bed a chore.

If the surface is made of thick enough fabric, stubbed toes wouldn't be a concern.  And the lamps can totally have the switches wired closer to the bed.  I agree with the laptop and the plant though.  I also love the skylight, and I would probably try to hack up some arduino curtain solution for it that allows me to open and shut the skylight from anywhere in the room. It doesn't even have to be perfectly blacked out. Not everyone is so sensitive to light that they can't sleep unless they're in a perfectly dark room, and sometimes having the sunlight come through the window in the morning can help you get up early and feel refreshed."

Problem solved.

There is no doubting that, I stand by the annoying  factor of having a skylight right above the bed. I like the idea of the electronic shade/ glass thingy, but if you have ever had a shade, even a high tech motorized shade, or one specially designed for arctic days you know that there is always that teeny tiny sliver of light that gets through. Sometimes it's a small hole. And will turn the space across from it into a pinhole camera projection. To me the one disadvantage heavily out ways the one advantage of a pretty night sky."

RoomPorn,2vzpuz,Lizzy_Blue,0,Sun Feb 15 23:04:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, because the skylight is directly above the bed, the sun would only fall directly on the bed around noon each day. So if you're cool with getting up by around 11 every day I don't think this would be a problem."

This is practically a Grand Theft Auto V type render of a room.  It's not like some of the more realistic renders that appear here every once in a while.

That shelf to hold bottles is set back so far under the counter. You'll need to be on your knees in order to see anything to grab it. Why is the bath water coming out of a sluice? It's not even slightly functional. It sticks out so far that you can only sit one way in that bathtub. Is there a mirror? Though I'd be afraid to see myself after stumbling through the grooming process, here. Carpet in bathrooms...the best reason to ever take off your shoes. The light bulbs must be a pain in the ass to change.   (Yes, it is pretty. And the other amenities are probably just outside the camera's viewfinder. But goodness, I'd hate to live there.)

RoomPorn,2vf7a8,holyhellitsmatt,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'm German, from the north, near Denmark and totally agree. So don't get me wrong, I love some strong lines and a white washed interior. But I also think a white washed interior with strong angles lends itself very well to exhibiting art in certain places and I think this design misses some opportunities. Especially given the fact that the skeleton of the building is so rustic and rugged, I think there's a real opportunity to pull together the fantastic, minimal modern interior with some carefully chosen art and other accents. A conversation between the two highly contrasting elements so to speak. But then again, if you're really a minimalist you wouldn't be into this idea. But I'm not, hence my opinion."

RoomPorn,2vb3lg,FrauKanzler,21,Mon Feb 9 20:34:45 2015 UTC,"As a former aquarium hobbyist & geek (reefs and tropical marine fish), I would expect it would be very similar to cleaning the glass in an aquarium... or the really big ones in public aquariums.  The quality of the water will have a lot to do with the level and frequency of cleaning, so if the pool is maintained properly I expect it will require less maintenance than tanks designed to sustain all kinds of marine life.  I suspect their regular maintenance consists of scraping off the pool side for any algae that sticks to the glass, which can be done through the room side with a good magnetic cleaner/scraper designed for this task.  Maybe they go snorkeling occasionally with a weight-belt for deeper cleaning.  One thing I would be cautious of though are those pool sweeps that swim around daily, as you wouldn't want to be running into the glass, although an occasional bump wouldn't break it.  The room side would probably be cleaned like any other window.  If they used an acrylic window they'll have to be extra careful not to scratch the viewing window.  This is all an educated guess."

RoomPorn,2v77p7,babak147,21,Sun Feb 8 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"Sassanian architecture is in general quite humbling and it is a shame very little of it lasted. This is the advantage European historical architecture has, in that it was never at the crossroads of multiple empires and did not have to withstand as many invasions, so it's still standing today - else there'd be tourist hotspots all over Mesopotamia and Iran.  EDIT: Should really clarify that last sentence as it is rubbing people the wrong way, but I am primarily referring to Sassanian architecture, which was built on a grand scale, yet little of it survives. I am not talking of the later Islamic architecture that survives."

We know the Sassanians characteristically built tall, yet nothing of the scale of say the Colosseum remains in Iran, for example. This is not just due to wars but also natural disasters such as earthquakes, as was the case tragically for Bam Citadel.  Achaemenid architecture survives partially in Iran as much of it was carved into rock (as is the case for say Petra), the rest that wasn't has largely been reconstructed. The Parthians were not builders, which leaves the Sassanians who I am referring to. They built on a huge scale, I'm talking comparable to Roman architecture but not much of it survives."

Different arch geometries result in different force resistant characteristics. The ""taller"" the arch, the less outward thrust it exerts as it ""tries to"" flatten out when loaded.

I'm talking about the balance of full to empty space, the visual contrast of the white vs black furniture, and the fact that the eye naturally pulls to the wall that has the tv on it, due to where the doors are in the room.  Believe it or not, the fish tank would actually be much more impactful if it was along the big wall at the far end.  Also, when you look at the black and white pieces, the look would be slightly more coherent if the three white pieces (2 parts of the sofa and the tank) were cradling the 2 black pieces (coffee table and entertainment center) lengthwise.  I can't describe ""why"" any more than a musician just knows what a minor chord is or an ancient Greek can just feel what's so special about the golden ratio.

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,wizardcats,11,Sat Feb 7 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"My mom insisted on matchy-matchy themes for kid's bedrooms, based around a specific color. I always had a room that way so I assumed it was universal. I was quite confused when I asked a friend what color her bedroom was, and she told me she didn't have a central unifying color for everything in her room.  And I mean everything. My color was mauve. Mauve carpet and mauve paint on two walls. Floral wallpaper on the other two walls in a mauve pallete. Matching wallpaper border around the entire room. Mauve-print bedspread with matching bed skirt. And matching curtains to tie it all together.  My brother had a blue theme, naturally. Blue carpet and blue paint on two walls. Geometric wallpaper on the other walls in shades of blue. Sports-themed wallpaper border with blue hues. Blue plaid comforter, bed skirt, and curtains.  When I was 10, I was allowed to re-design my room. Which meant I got to pick a theme color (purple) and pick out all the purple things to go with it. It just didn't even occur to me to suggest using two different colors at the same time, or maybe picking something neutral like beige carpet."

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,moogle516,10,Fri Feb 6 22:06:44 2015 UTC,Those parents are going to get exactly what they deserve
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,blackadder1132,51,Fri Feb 6 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"Having an expensive bedroom does not define who you are as a person. What does define you is how you treat other people and what you do and say. Standing up for injustice, tolerance, donating time and money, assisting the less fortunate, and not disparaging someone based on appearance is part of the equation. To make a blanket statement that solely based on the appearance of a child's room one will absolutely be spoiled is sad. Will some unfortunately be spoiled, yes, but that is a function of a lack of parental involvement rather than the aesthetics of a room. Edit - there is a reason most Wealthy families do not last to the third generation, they have spent it all by then. But if we want trickle down economics to work, I am personally in favor of employing tradesmen and craftsmen to create rooms. It is better for the economy than letting the money sit idly in a bank account."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,hothrous,147,Fri Feb 6 20:15:47 2015 UTC,You know absolutely nothing about the parents other than they're wealthy enough to afford this room.
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,Kallisti50253,113,Fri Feb 6 21:45:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I don't understand the hatred. Well-off parents built a cool room for their child that likes fairy tales. If they had built a room the looks like Jurassic Park for a kid that likes dinosaurs, I doubt we'd hear any complaints. What is it about princesses that's so offensive?"

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,epiphanette,-14,Fri Feb 6 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"As somebody that would have loved to have this as a kid, I think the only time I would consider something to this extent OK is when the parents actually built it themselves.   Spending 70K on somebody else building the perfect bedroom for a child, teaches the child that they can get anything they want with money. Building it, especially if you have the child partake in the building process, teaches the child that most of what you want can be attained through hard work."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,HiThereImNewHere,19,Fri Feb 6 17:10:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you get to decide what's ok for parents to get for their kids? My twins have a ridiculous room and it is probably going to teach them that you can do really cool things if you have enough money, but we're also going to teach them that you have to work for the money to do that kind of thing."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,moogle516,-14,Fri Feb 6 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Empathy is the ability to understand the situation of another. This largely develops because we have a set of experiences to draw on that we didn't enjoy happening to us so we are able to better understand when others have things that happen to them that they don't enjoy.   People who get really cool things all the time tend not to develop this to such a great degree.   Basically, this is how this whole discussion is happening.   Side A: This is likely to develop this person into an asshole because the history in child development shows that when children get everything they want growing up, the develop an expectation that they will get everything they want growing up.  Side B: Don't tell me how to raise my child!  On your point about ""Really cool things if you have enough money."" That isn't a thing that kids need to be taught. You can look around and see that really cool things often cost money. That is something that gets developed by atmosphere."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,Vnewb,11,Fri Feb 6 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"First off, how is having a nice bedroom ""getting everything they want""? My children will have nice things because we have the money to provide them, but they will not get everything they've ever wanted.  Having excess does not mean that they will lack empathy and you are making generalizations without knowing the situation.   Also, the way you are depicting this conversation is not accurate. I never said anything about you telling me how to raise my children, I only asked why it is that you seem to think your opinion is the most important one."

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,holymotherogod,-14,Sat Feb 7 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it is not the room, but the room has a strong implication of raising the child to think they are in fact a princess, with the status, privileges and the rest that come along with it. Doing that in a healthy way is going to be the extreme exception."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,aquaventure,0,Sat Feb 7 02:27:18 2015 UTC,No it's fine
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,holymotherogod,-21,Fri Feb 6 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"Mmmm....from a personal perspective, Jurassic Park involves struggle against a very strong, arguably natural opponent.   Princesses sit around and tell people to do things, authority and leadership roles being derived by right of birth and succession. If I had a child, this is an attitude I would attempt to strongly discourage, male or female."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,aquaventure,32,Sat Feb 7 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"Uhhh I think if a child had a Jurassic park room they'd think it's cool because dinosaurs, not because man vs nature.   Little girls like to pretend to be princesses. Princess isn't synonymous with spoiled. Princesses are taught etiquette, poise, manners, and appearance. Not bossiness."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,HiThereImNewHere,10,Fri Feb 6 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly, up yo Sophia the First game son!"
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,aquaventure,-16,Fri Feb 6 21:16:53 2015 UTC,"What I meant was, the qualities being shown by the main character - intelligence, adaptability, survivability and leadership roles are ones that should be supported and encouraged. The metaphorical ""dinosaurs"" can be swapped out with any other adverse phenomenon.   This has not been my experience with girls or boys that have been encouraged to be princes or princesses. They are, in most instances, quite spoiled."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,CantaloupeCamper,12,Fri Feb 6 17:01:55 2015 UTC,Generalize much?  Almost every little girl wants to be a princess. Disney has created a 160 billion dollar company based on this fact.
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,linds360,-9,Fri Feb 6 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yes: and having lived and worked in my parents apartment block, holding 26 families I can tell you that girls growing up having been told that they're ""princesses"" generally derive the message ""You're innately better than everyone else"" and grow up to be spoiled brats.  Some even attempt to order me around when I'm working in their homes.   You did see the ""in my personal perspective"" clause in my first statement, yes?"
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,abundantplums,5,Fri Feb 6 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"hahaha i did. just because you say, ""in my personal perspective"" doesnt preclude you from people telling you that you're wrong."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,mcrackin,-6,Fri Feb 6 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"Let's see, 26 families with girls who were called princesses every day, and terribly spoiled. 17 of them would regularly quite literally order me to fix their cars or electronics, glue other tenant's locks they disagreed with, and during their teen years would regularly start fights. All ""Princesses""   ...in what way is my personal perspective on this matter wrong? They were constantly coddled, their egos fed, and they became horrible human beings. This might not be the case everywhere, but, in my experience it has occured. I also said, ""If I had a child"". I did not tell people how to raise theirs.   So no, in my personal perspective in the breadth of my experience, I am not wrong. You may, of course attempt to change my perspective, but I doubt you could find any individual with this level of luxury at a young age that isn't a grade ""A"" asshole."

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,moogle516,28,Fri Feb 6 17:13:42 2015 UTC,Are they sowing a life of comfort and extravagance? Because that's probably what they're reaping.
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,totes_meta_bot,5,Fri Feb 6 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"And realistically, their child will probably grow up to have a life of comfort and extravagance. They'll pay for her to go to a good school and university, and she'll go on to have a successful high-paying career. And there's nothing wrong with that, except a lot of people like to pretend that class doesn't exist anymore or at least that it's not inherited."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,genitaliban,3,Fri Feb 6 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I grew up in a poor family but probably closer to lower-middle-class. Parents who generally lived paycheck to paycheck kind of thing but could still afford to put my sister and I through some sports.  I had to work after high school to save up for university myself and didn't end up going until I was 26. I'm now 30 graduating from a top tier business school and have a decent job lined up once I graduate.  I've met my fair share of students who obviously grew up in well-to-do families. Didn't have to finance any of their own education etc. The thing I've noticed though, contrary to what the original commenter says, is that a lot of these ""rich kids"" really are hard-working. I've had to work my ass off to get where I am today and against a lot of odds. But one example of many - I know this kid who drives his parents Bentley to school and his father started a company that's now listed on the TSX in Canada. As hard a worker I think I am, I know this guy personally and he works his ass off at everything he does. Doesn't go out and party, doesn't whine or bitch. He knows he was given a good spot in life to do great things and he's doing it right.  I've noticed a lot of ""rich kids"" at this school doing the same thing and this isn't just a one-off example.  This leads me to believe that if someone is born into a family of parents who generated their wealth through hard work and by good means, their children tend to follow suit. However if they generated their wealth through luck, corruption, or just being an asshole, their children will probably follow suit and that wealth won't remain in the family very long. The personality of the children is rubbed off from the personality of the parents and has very little to do with wealth IMO."

RoomPorn,2uz6nd,blackadder1132,3,Fri Feb 6 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"If she does grow up to be high maintenance, she could very well earn enough to ""maintain"" herself. Her parents will probably provide her the best of everything, including education. It's so backwards how many people are assuming a girl can't grow up to earn her own fortune. It's no longer realistic for rich families to have a network for the parents to marry off a girl to a rich man, and it's also freaking 2015 and women are now allowed to be successful in their own right.   This girl will probably grow up to be a lawyer or surgeon, and will be able to buy her own designer shoes."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,wizardcats,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you there, but I think OP was referring about wanting things and just getting them because the parents give the child a $70,000 room, not in the ""I pay my own bills to maintain myself"" way."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,TP-LINQ,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"But it's a freaking kid. Of course her parents will pay for her bedroom, because she's a freaking kid. Rich or poor, parents give things to their kids.  You can't deny that there's a double standard here. Rich parents buy luxuries for both sons and daughters, but people don't leap to the assumption that boys will grow up expecting to have a spouse who always give them things. A boy who got an expensive bedroom  would turn out to be just as ""high maintenance"", but the assumption is that he would get a good job and pay for his own stuff."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,pissface13,-2,Fri Feb 6 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"What does how your dress have to do with how high/low maintenance you are?  I'm not saying that you are, but typically, people that are high maintenance don't even realize that they are. The people that think they are generally aren't as much as they think, or they are so high maintenance that even they realize it.  Also, the reason this would raise a person to be high maintenance doesn't have to do with interest in Princesses. It has to do with spending $70K to give your kid exactly the room she wants this year."
RoomPorn,2uz6nd,sparklecooch,5,Fri Feb 6 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"But it was the parents who spent the money. Not the child. The parents would be the high maintenance ones in this case.

We don't know."

RoomPorn,2uuznu,SquillDiggles,2,Sun Feb 8 08:00:40 2015 UTC,"Basically you make a hollow frame of wood and tamp damp earth into it, layer by layer, and remove the frame, leaving a dense wall behind.

RoomPorn,2uuznu,SquillDiggles,1 point,Mon Feb 9 13:49:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks."
RoomPorn,2uuznu,ForTheTable,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"With the beautiful aesthetics, I think it's also worth mentioning that rammed earth is an overall exceptional building material.   It's fireproof, moldproof and bulletproof, yet it allows for better airflow and air quality in your home (on top of there being none of the toxic chemicals that are found in typical construction materials/paints).   The thermal mass is much better than standard construction materials--it naturally holds heat in the winter and stays cool in the summer--making it one of the most energy efficient materials, too. (The construction process is also much more carbon friendly, as you're typically using soil on site rather than shipping materials.)  Most modern rammed earth walls are made with a small amount of portland cement mixed into the soil before it's tamped. This makes it weather proof. Reinforced rammed earth walls have also been shown to score more than 5x the strength of the concrete walls that many buildings use per regulatory codes. They've also stood up much better in hurricane and tornado wind forces.  Overall, rammed earth lasts hundreds of years, is more efficient and often scores 5X stronger than most of the materials used to meet code requirements... And, as r/fyir pointed out, it looks awesome.    A similar construction material is Compressed Earth Blocks (CEB), which is the same principle as rammed earth, but is where you're using a machine to compress soil into bricks. It has the same advantages as rammed earth, but is easier and more accommodating to modular structures.   CEB construction is just now starting to take off in poorer countries, as it allows for unskilled workers to build high-quality homes from the soil beneath their feet. It hasn't taken off in the States yet for a couple of reasons:   Building codes in the U.S. don't account for compressed earth materials, meaning structural engineers aren't comfortable signing off on plans that use them (They were almost taught about cement, concrete and standard stick frame construction in school) It takes more time and work to build with rammed earth. Most homes are built by developers who, naturally, aim to make them as fast/cheap as possible to sell for the most profit.

RoomPorn,2umqq6,EZKTurbo,113,Tue Feb 3 23:20:11 2015 UTC,It looks like the perfect poolside bathroom. A place to get yourself cleaned up after the pool but that you don't have to give a second thought to dripping water everywhere.

RoomPorn,2uiplh,whoremaker,6,Mon Feb 2 18:44:34 2015 UTC,I remember reading an article about a bike shop that opened in an old slaughterhouse. They used the old hooks to hoist up tires because they kept all of the tracks from the assembly line. They kept the original floor too.
RoomPorn,2uiplh,nill0c,2,Mon Feb 2 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty cool and industrious.  I'm sure they washed off all the blood or at least bleached the floor, right?  The walls in the open lost picture still look stained from previous industrial use.  Even shipping containers that are repurposed as buildings need to be treated and look cleaner than those concrete / brick walls."
RoomPorn,2uiplh,HorizontalBrick,3,Mon Feb 2 19:00:11 2015 UTC,The walls look more like old untreated weathered concrete than industrial chemical stained concrete

After years of this, all the chemicals splashing / blowing / leaching / clinging to the walls add up.  What everyone in this thread is talking about is whether it's safe to convert such a building into a home, because of all the industrial residue inevitably left behind. Do you understand yet?"
RoomPorn,2uiplh,nathaliew817,7,Tue Feb 3 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"Also it was a cement factory, so there really aren't many concerns (other than insane dust removal probably.  Those walls are just old, and probably sealed now as well. I used to apply concrete sealer to old repurposed mills with my dad's waterproofing company, we could make anything water and grime proof, even if it looked old and worn."
RoomPorn,2uiplh,rrpjdisc,2,Tue Feb 3 04:15:53 2015 UTC,Yeah but Europeans have much higher safety standards than us and it looks like a great deal of money was spent on fixing it up.  Yeah I know that concrete is made from some pretty nasty caustic shit before it becomes what we usually like.

RoomPorn,2uf82l,abundantplums,88,Sun Feb 1 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the design could be improved a bit by adding a small lip to the backside of the table to prevent that. Still pretty nice."
RoomPorn,2uf82l,Enginerdiest,65,Sun Feb 1 20:41:36 2015 UTC,While I agree I think adding any type of lip to that slab would ruin the whole table.
RoomPorn,2uf82l,Adolf_,13,Sun Feb 1 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, generally when you have slab table you want to show off the wood's grain, knots, etc. Putting on a backsplash would just look tacky unless you cut the slab and put that cut vertical as the backsplash, but then you loose the appeal."
RoomPorn,2uf82l,mrMouseR,42,Sun Feb 1 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Or just get a slab that is an inch thicker than you need, and cut away everything else, but leave the inch higjer as the backsplash."

RoomPorn,2uf82l,Cherismylovechild,2,Sun Feb 1 20:59:19 2015 UTC,The beam lights would be fine if they didn't have those hanging globes. And that vase should probably be replaced with some high end memorabilia.
RoomPorn,2uf82l,pachewychomp,3,Sun Feb 1 21:35:30 2015 UTC,What's wrong with the hanging globes?  I think they look dope

RoomPorn,2uf82l,General_Hide,105,Sun Feb 1 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of the downward facing direct lighting. With little pockets of space in the ceiling, the owner could have easily shot light into those pockets to give the space more indirect lighting.   The indirect lighting would be less harsh on the eyes and make the space more relaxed vs feeling like a sales floor at Banana Republic."

RoomPorn,2uf82l,BaconisComing,7,Sun Feb 1 20:36:58 2015 UTC,I'll take indirect over direct any day
RoomPorn,2uf82l,whalepopcorn,3,Sun Feb 1 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, this.  I have recessed LED lighting and the damn things actually cause headaches.  It's like someone shining an LED flashlight into your eyes, even if the lighting isn't shining directly at you.  You feel it in your mid-forehead, between your eyes... like squinting too much and for too long.  I hate direct LED lighting."
RoomPorn,2uf82l,lost_in_thesauce,6,Mon Feb 2 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"This is a great point.   Also, those ""beams"" above. They're purely decorative since they have a can light where they cross each other. I like the look, but the lights' location are a giveaway that it's faked.   Other than that, this room is pretty epic."

RoomPorn,2uf82l,oleitas,3,Sun Feb 1 18:22:14 2015 UTC,Correct. No sound dampening just massively deep vaulted ceilings with 2-3' trim definitely not cheap

Some of them are in pretty dangerous areas though."

Apparently there's a 10 year waiting list for just a spot to put your boat, and the rental fee was similar to an apartment.  These aren't hobos living like this to save money, these are rich/retired fold living like this because it's romantic.  It was super beautiful there, if I could I'd seriously consider it."

RoomPorn,2ubew5,Ralph_Waldo_Emerson,30,Sat Jan 31 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Since I live on a boat (albeit in Denmark) I can answer these for you.    You don't get motion sickness on windy days. Have you ever looked at the waves in a canal and seen how small they are? Even if it's a hurricane. There might be a bit of bumping back and forth in your moorings, but certainly not enough to get motionsick.  You do have to get on land every once in a while to get the bottom fixed. How often depends on how well you did it last time, how exposed the boat is (saltwater is much worse than fresh water) and how much you love your boat and want the water on the outside to stay there. Personally I get my boat on land every 3 years or so. Usually it's between 3 and 5, 10 if you have a big (heavy to tow and crane) barge."
RoomPorn,2ubew5,ilikeCRUNCHYturtles,7,Sat Jan 31 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Curious, how much does it cost to repair or refinish the underside of a boat like that?"
RoomPorn,2ubew5,Ralph_Waldo_Emerson,18,Sat Jan 31 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"I've just had my boat on land a few months ago, so you can get the approximate numbers from that:   dock including 14 days - $1000  paint - $800 sanding discs, tools, other looses bit and ends - $500   My boat is 12 meters long, weighs around 11 tons and this was a major repair where I sanded and hammered all the old bottom paint off and applied new. That only has to be dome every 20 years. So for the next 20 years I will spend around 3 days in the dock every 3 years just to keep the bottom well maintained. That should cost around half of the above. Maybe less.   Hope it helped answer your questions :-)  And if you get the chance to live on a boat: Do it. It's great!"

RoomPorn,2ubew5,Ralph_Waldo_Emerson,22,Sat Jan 31 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"around 8 years, it was kind of an experiment. I just bought a boat and took it from there - didn't have the first clue about how boat-stuff worked. Now I do :-)  I've redone the whole interior, which has been an interesting challenge. My boat is 12 meters long and 3.4 meters wide, which gives me around 20 square meters of living space. It's not easy to get a comfortable living space out of that, but I think I've done quite well. I have managed to get a full bathroom, a full kitchen, double bed, cabinets, eating table for 6 people, office, spare bed, a wood furnace and a freezer crammed in. Looks pretty good now, complete with massive oak floors and beautiful view :-)  I actually thought about snapping a few pics for /r/roomporn"

Also,  barnacles and other marine life likes to attach to the bottom of your boat, which has a tendency to penetrate any kind of membrane. When you have a breach you have a problem.   The proven way is around 5 coats of epoxy and 2 coats of antifouling on top of that."

RoomPorn,2ubew5,dominoconsultant,2,Sun Feb 1 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why? I get that it's romanticized, but what exactly sucks about it?  PS: Sorry you're being down voted."
RoomPorn,2ubew5,witoldc,3,Sun Feb 1 04:38:43 2015 UTC,"Well I won't go into details about being underway, too much and mostly depends on what type of voyage you take. (work, travel, vacation) So I'll just talk about why living on a barge sucks.   For starters that room is all the personal space you have. Anything you need to have aboard has to fit in that little room, and in the spaces provided (cabinets, lockers, etc) which is very small. Everything you bring that won't fit there has to be secured for sea. That bed looks that way because it won't have a chance of sliding out and destroying things around it or killing someone. That desk is probably bolted into the ground.   The room itself is very neat, clean, and aesthetically pleasing but that's about it. All you CAN have is a bed and desk. If we're talking about what sucks on living on a barge/boat then here's a small list:   You can only do your laundry on assigned days, times, and using ""grey"" water. (You can't exactly use drinking water to wash your clothes)...that's if you're lucky enough to have laundry machines on board, otherwise you have to store dirty clothes until you can wash it.* All bathrooms are public and if broken, stay broken for a while. Ship's plumbing put a couple of things ahead of bathroom privileges which uses the same steam and pipes. Drinking water, engine water (which turns to steam to power other necessities), and (depending on what kind of ship you're on) firefighting water/plumbing takes priority.  Ships are constantly dirty and require daily cleaning to make sure shit doesn't pile up. Mildew is really common since condensation of steam powered operations happen constantly. So while it might be nice to live on a barge/boat, you will have chores to do to make sure it stays clean/nice/tidy The only entertainment you can have are movies, computer games, or books. Most barges don't have internet and very few have shitty wifi.  Any storm requires work to secure everything loose in place. If not shit flies everywhere and there will be property damage. That means EVERYTHING that isn't bolted down (silverware, plates, pots, food in the freezer/fridge, books, etc.) SOME ships/barges have many decks and thick hulls which makes reception inside it impossible. If you're inside the boat you will have minimal reception unless very close to a window. The steel surrounding you blocks a lot of it.  the constant motion blows. If the seas are rough good luck trying to do much aboard. It's fun at first (or sickening) but it gets old when you're trying to take a shower and the water is spilling about on the ground that you have to mop up later to avoid mildew from forming up    This is some of the stuff. Mostly the worst part are your shipmates. You have to put up a lot with their hygiene and shit. If one of them isn't on the same page you can't really do anything about it, if they make a mess its also your mess. If they break something, they broke something that you also use. if they get sick, you get sick. Ships are really communal because of how much you have to share and rely on your shipmates for shit.   hope that answers it, I could always clean this up later. If you have any question about it and stuff just ask. Personal boats/yachts and stuff are great, but require a lot of maintenance. Barges and such blow."

RoomPorn,2uclii,invenio78,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:47:10 2015 UTC,This is perfect. Not too tacky but with a sliver of grandeur
RoomPorn,2uclii,OldMcFart,-1,Mon Feb 2 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is worth a fortune but I can't get over the ""ikea"" look.  It's a wonderful space but all I see is plastic tables and cabinets that appear to have a cheap finish (much like you would see at ikea).  Google says the price is over $2 million USD.  What's wrong with getting some furnishings and decor that were not made in a chemical factory?"
RoomPorn,2uclii,julle_1,3,Sun Feb 1 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing anything that makes me think of IKEA here. But even if there were, IKEA provide cheap alternatives of much more expensive similarly designed (but much much higher quality) furniture, and so I could understand if there were a resemblance.  Nothing in the pictures makes me think cheap and plastic; rather well designed, high quality and minimal."
RoomPorn,2uclii,invenio78,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:54:28 2015 UTC,I was going to say...! Typical mix between scandinavian and italian design that Ikea tries to emulate with mixed results.
RoomPorn,2uclii,julle_1,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"There's nothing cheap or plastic in that pic. Just nice clean lines which is very common theme in Scandinavian design. IKEA happens to follow similar design principles in some of their products, as do hundreds of other companies, but other than that no comparison."
RoomPorn,2uclii,OldMcFart,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:59:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm totally wrong here.  And that's ok.  But the edge of the dining room table looks like plastic.  I don't know how else they would get a black strip on there.  Also, the table is actually sagging, you can see this when zoomed in.  The multi-shelf cart in the background totally looks like plastic.  Again, the finish on the cabinets looks cheap.  Literally, ikea's fake wood veneers look just like that.  And that nice walmart $4 large plastic plant holder on the 2nd floor edge really ties it all together.  Maybe this is all really expensive stuff, but it ""looks like ikea"".  It all looks factory made vs hand crafted.  I totally get that people may love this design, and there is no ""right or wrong"" answer.  But I can't get over cheap plastic decorations in a $2 million dollar apartment.  But that's just me."
RoomPorn,2uclii,invenio78,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand if you don't like the design style. Its not for everyone obviously, and definitely similar to stuff you see in IKEA.  But I can assure you that materials used on that apartment are top quality both in terms of money spent and materials used.   Maybe those things ""look like IKEA"" to you because you're not familiar with the style or it's mostly what you've seen in IKEA. But for people who live in Scandinavia or are used the design language, what you see in the pic is what you see in most places. So there's nothing ""IKEA"" in it really because most stuff is designed with similar ideas behind, from the very high end to the low-end IKEA stuff.  And that place is definitely the former."
RoomPorn,2uclii,OldMcFart,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"The whole table top is black, no strip. It's wood."
RoomPorn,2uclii,invenio78,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the dining room table.  White tabletop, black side strip, and wooden square legs.  And the sag in the middle.  The tabletop may or may not be wood as it's hard to tell from the picture, but if it is wood, it's heavily processed as wood typically does not tend to be pure white or black with a gloss finish."
RoomPorn,2uclii,OldMcFart,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the overhead light from the windows reflecting in the table top made it look white, but this is probably the table in question: http://www.bolia.com/sv-se/sortiment/matrummet/matbord/03-033-05_4840  Personally, while I love minimalism, I don't really care for the furniture in this apartment. They probably bought it before the prices went through the roof, and really couldn't afford some nice stuff :-D"

RoomPorn,2uc5gt,T-Shazam,3,Sun Feb 1 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"I love the way this place looks. It's got a really heavy, old-school feel about it.   I can see a bunch old rich dudes sitting around together, smoking cigars and drinking expensive bourbon... figuring out ways they were gonna make more money."
RoomPorn,2uc5gt,OB1_kenobi,4,Sun Feb 1 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"It's attempting that sort of old-school feel, but too many of the details are off. Look at those curtain rods; they only extend partway over the windows, and need a valance to cover the curtain rod. It just looks tacky the way it is now.    The couches have the same problem; they look like they're made from microfiber which just doesn't work with the feel the room is going for. The little priest statue, the plants and the book on the music stand or whatever that is all have the same problem. They feel slightly off and out of place, and in a room attempting to be this fancy having those kinds of errors ruins the whole thing.   It'd be a bit like getting in a Rolls Royce and finding out it has vinyl seats, a molded plastic dash and someone left fast food rappers in the back seat. Sure, it looks nice at first, but on second look none of the details are right."

RoomPorn,2u83oc,tomdarch,5,Sat Jan 31 05:22:22 2015 UTC,"At the time the materials and styles were pretty new, so they didn't actually have a great grasp on how they would age over time.

It great and all, but I wouldn't want to live in a 1-10 million dollar house in a neighborhood where people are still living very poor.  It's like building a mansion in the ghetto.    Oh.. and that 1-10 million doesn't actually give you ownership.  You're getting a 30-30-30 lease.  After 90 years, you lose everything.  (Well.. your kids lose it.)  But even after the first 30 years, it's far from certain that they will allow you to renew your 30 year lease.  You might be out of luck even after 30 years."

RoomPorn,2tyjkz,MotherBeef,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"It's strange, I have no 'collective' tendcies with anything. I don't like seeing stacks/shelves of DVDs, I prefer them on a hard drive or provided by an online service. Similarly with video games I'll hide them in cupboards or exclusively use a service like Steam to hold them all. But with books, a shelf of books looks amazing to me. I read only semi- regularly (I'll go in spurts of smashing out 4 books then burn out for a month or two)  and yet one of my goals of my future home is to have a grand bookshelf. This being the perfect dream. A kindle would make more sense and I know they are vastly more convenient. I just like books and how in a shelf they all look completely different and yet together all seem to match and fit just perfectly."
RoomPorn,2tyjkz,anon72c,15,Thu Jan 29 13:34:41 2015 UTC,The ladder is captured by tracks inset in the floor and shelving.
RoomPorn,2tyjkz,MexicanGolf,5,Wed Jan 28 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that metal rail thing on the floor has the ladder anchored, and wouldn't be surprised if the top of it is somehow secured to the edge it is leaning against.  It's hard to tell, but I do assume that whoever designed this wasn't completely incompetent and that they did consider safety and usability in their design."

It actually looks like the older, nicer houses in southern cities. I like it, and it reminds me of home, but the country part seems out of place. That's just my opinion, though. Maybe I'm unaware of what qualifies as ""country"" from a stylistic standpoint."
