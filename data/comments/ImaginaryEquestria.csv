And despite this background being so full of stuff, that tiny Trixie still stands out.   Also, such smart usage of lighting to create a more interesting space. The way fireflies are used to illustrate the bottom and back of the bridge. And how the brightness of city just pull your eyes into the distance.   Some small details that you will notice if you download the image   The graffiti under the bridge FS + RD on a tree near right edge"

To me, it looks like the artist recently decided to get a deviantArt account and is now uploading some older works.    Anyway, now for this particular picture:  A reverse image search took me to this e621.net post [Warning: NSFW]. It uses the same artist tag as derpibooru (the inverted A) and cites this (now deleted) derpibooru post as a source. As you can see, it's pretty much the same image except her lower belly is slightly uhh... different.  So I my guess is that the artist decided to get rid of the lewd body parts before uploading it to deviantArt, hence the [remake].  TL:DR: The deviantArt source is legit"

This is a place meant for masterpieces of My Little Pony fanart.    HOWEVER: Mods do not dictate at all what is quality artwork, YOU DO. Artwork is subjective, and mods realize this. If I removed every post that I felt was not ""up to my standard"", then I would be a tyrant.  I have always seen this place much more akin to EQD's Drawfriend, except reddit dictates the quality instead of mods.  A few ways we are different from /r/MyLittlePony:   We do not accept comics We do not accept anything that isn't related to My Little Pony artwork All submissions must follow the the INE rules. We encourage old and overlooked artwork to be found more than new and recent, as well as archiving the best.     I personally strongly encourage the use of downvotes on works that you feel are not up to par. If you feel an artwork does not deserve to be here, downvote it.    I do not wish to be a tyrant of this place, so I will never remove artworks based on what is ""quality"" (given it's clearly not trolling). On that note, I am actually looking for another mod to take care of this place. Ever since I became curator of fandoms, I've not been giving this place due justice. /u/Coelacanth0794 and /u/schnitzellover seem both equally likely to get the position, so I will mod either if they want the spot.  That way, they can impose a new rule that dictates a minimum quality level of artwork."

However, as it's not really obvious that that is the point of the subreddit (put it in the sidebar or on the submission page or something) I would think that very few people currently do this.  I'm also sure a number of subscribers only see content from their front page and might vote on it without realizing which subreddit that content was submitted to (though there's nothing to be done about that)."

ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,CrystalLord,6,Thu Mar 12 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'll chime in! These are all great questions.   Some of this is repeating what /u/CrystalLord already stated, but I wanted to get all of this in one post, so please forgive any redundancy.     The difference between the INE and the IN  The Imaginary Network Expanded (INE) was inspired by the Imaginary Network (big 4 - landscapes, monsters, characters, technology), however the two groups were not able to successfully negotiate a merge, so the INE is in fact run independently by a different mod staff than the big 4.     INE Mission Statement:   It is the goal of the Imaginary Network Expanded to share, inspire, discuss and appreciate paintings, drawings, and digital art while maintaining artist credit and source links.    What differentiates the INE from other subs?   The INE differs from most other subs in our rules. Particularly:   Rule #1 - You must submit the original source if known.    This rule is to help maximize views to an artist's webpage.    Rule #2  - You must include the real name of the artist in the submission title if known.    We bill ourselves as giving proper artist credit network-wide. Also this rule helps prevent reposts by always using the artist name, as opposed to what could be multiple pseudonyms depending on what source the artist posted to (example, different username for tumblr than DeviantArt).   Rule #8 - This is a curated forum. Posts and comments are subject to removal at the discretion of the moderators.   This is the catch-all rule that was intended to cover quality control. It is rarely enforced because it is so very subjective. On personal preference, I don't like to deal in heavy handed curation myself. I'd rather let the downvotes fall where they may.   That being said, the rule is there for good reason. The INE is democracy in whole, and each individual sub has the prerogative to use rule #8 flexibly, so long as it is done respectfully.   The fear with heavy handed curation is that it will alienate submitters. Also you can be sure to get in a lot of arguments regarding the quality of a piece. My personal worst fear would be to remove OC and damage the psyche of a budding artist! The up side - a culture of only high quality submissions, possibly increasing subscriber count.   The fear with never enforcing rule #8 is that subscribers dwindle because the sub is saturated with what are perceived to be low quality works.     When I first joined the INE team it was important for me to grasp how something like /r/ImaginaryEquestria was different from /r/mylittlepony, so I latched on to the above rules... yes, this is how we are different. And while that is true, it is not so important to me anymore to make that distinction, because the bottom line is: reddit is a free market and subscribers go where the content, activity, and community are. It is the goal of the INE to have quality content and be a generally fun place to be. If you build it, they will come.    The INE Dropdown Menu  The dropdown menu is the handy black menu bar beneath the sub name. Hover over any tab and the menu will drop, showing each sub included in that category. Click directly on the category instead, and you will be taken to a multireddit of that tab.   The dropdown menu works on CSS and the sub list portion must live in the sidebar. There is a sidebar character limit which we are approaching in many subs. It has been proposed that we replace the dropdown menu with a wiki. That may very well happen in the near future, if no other solution can be determined. We really love that dropdown menu and would hate to see it go. I don't think many people use it or even notice it. I find it to be super handy.     What is ""Imaginary""??  This question comes up fairly often at places like /r/ImaginaryBeasts and /r/ImaginaryCityscapes. OH NO YOU DIDN'T POST TORONTO! Yes I did. ""Imaginary"" is simply the naming scheme that ties all of our subreddits together into a single network. All artwork is inherently imaginary.    Why are there so many mods here?  The INE has a open-door policy on moderation. This  means that we have no limit to the # of mods we can have. We're always looking for fresh blood that will bring value to the sub.  There are 3 levels of moderator here at the INE:  Senior Mods:   A Senior Mod has provided much value to the network in order to get where they are today. Any mod can be promoted if their commitment is great enough. Senior Mods are assigned mods to EVERY official INE sub to ensure network-wide oversight. Senior Mods are responsible for assisting and coaching Curators & Junior Mods. Senior Mods vote weight on INE [VOTE] threads are x3. Their posting requirements are voluntary, being that it is unreasonable to ask anyone to post in 130+ INE subs on a weekly basis.   Curators:    A Curator has provided value to the network in order to get where they are today. Any mod can be promoted if their commitment is great enough. A Curator is responsible for every sub on a specific tab. Curators are responsible for assisting and coaching Junior Mods. Curators vote weight on INE [VOTE] threads are x2. They are expected to make at least one submission or comment per month to each sub that they curate.   Junior Mods:    A Junior Mod is any mod that isn’t a Curator or Senior Mod. Junior Mods typically moderate between 2 – 5 subreddits. Junior Mods are responsible for understanding and implementing INE rules and best practices. A Junior Mod can be promoted by showing their commitment to the network in the form of proactive participation. Junior Mods weight on INE [VOTE] threads is x1. They are expected to make at least one submission or comment per week to each sub that they moderate.   You can see a list of Senior Mods and Curators here    What is a ""champion"" mod?  This is an unofficial term we use to note who really loves a sub and takes special interest in it. That person typically calls the shots there within the confines of the INE rules and template. For example, I mod all the INE subs, but you could call me champion of /r/ImaginaryTurtleWorlds. It's like... my baby. <3    WHEW! I think I addressed everything you all brought up. Sorry, I have no TL;DR for you. Cheers! :)"

It seems that many of the ""imaginary"" subreddits have little-to-no description or posting guidelines at all, which makes for an interesting community self-moderation experiment, but not so good for consistency.  To my best understanding, the general idea seems to be original art and illustrations (not photographs) on a theme, with strong fantastical elements that wouldn't necessarily exist in the ""real world"". Like /r/ImaginaryMonsters, these are things which you might imagine existing but don't really. We could also call this place the ""fantasy-themed"" part of the MLP fanart community.  This takes on an interesting meta aspect when paired with an already-imaginary subject/muse, in this case the universe of MLP and the land of Equestria. Maybe appropriate submissions here might be that which venture outside the ""known"" universe of MLP. Not necessarily things which won't be on the show, or else general shipping and headcanon would apply. It's more complex than that.  In my opinion, the stuff that should be submitted here is not necessarily that which we would imagine as outside observers and fans of a TV show, but rather the things that a pony artist in Equestria might create, or in other words, the fantasy of a fantasy world."
ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,CrystalLord,5,Thu Mar 12 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"Artwork that expands upon MLP is certainly welcome and appreciated, but we primarily focus on quality. Quality however, is very subjective, and if you choose to define quality as innovation, you are completely free to do so.    Back in the summer of 2014, I lost my status here as the champion moderator. I am now the curator of Fandoms, meaning I run all the fandom subreddits in INE. Perhaps I should edit the wiki for all of them stating the purpose of the fandoms tab. They all need a lot of work, but 30+ subreddits is hard to maintain, even with the seniors' help. Most of them don't belong to any fandoms. In fact, I am the only brony on the mod team here.    I will likely make a wiki page in /r/ImaginaryNetwork that describes the purpose of each of the fandom subreddits, then link them in the sidebar if the space provides."
ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,CrystalLord,3,Thu Mar 12 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"I know you already mentioned two other users as possible moderators, but if you're looking for help, I wouldn't mind lending a hand."
ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,CrystalLord,2,Thu Mar 12 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of paperwork, let me see...  14 posts in IEQ is a little low, but it's acceptable.  To become a mod, you must have be active here for at least one month, as well as substantial karma. You meet those requirements so, yes, you are welcome to mod the subreddit.    Junior Moderation Crash Course:   You must post at least once a week, preferably everyday though. You probably should get reddit toolbox if you haven't already. You will have to enforce the INE sidebar rules. Even mods make mistakes, but there's a reason mods exist. If you see someone breaking the rules, you must remove the post and explain why. You will be spammed a lot with modmail, PMs and other biz. No exceptions.     You already mod /r/MyLittlePony, so I don't have much doubt if you can handle this small place.  I'm more inclined to give it Coelacanth or Schnitzy, but we have an open door policy. If they ask for modship, they are welcome to have it. Same goes for you.  So... you still up for it?"
ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,bvr5,3,Thu Mar 12 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Hrm... my only reservation is posting at least once a week, though I have no doubt that I could do if I made the effort.  The problem is me making the effort.  But I have been meaning to stop ignoring my dA queue (which apparently caps at around 10,500) and that would absolutely give me enough content to submit here.   Everything else I'm already used to being a mod of /r/mylittlepony, though I'm not familiar with reddit toolbox; for what would I need that?"
ImaginaryEquestria,2yt9zw,indigoblie,2,Thu Mar 12 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Hrm... my only reservation is posting at least once a week, though I have no doubt that I could do if I made the effort.   Yeah, which is why I named Coelecanth and Schnitzel, as they submit nearly everyday.   though I'm not familiar with reddit toolbox; for what would I need that?   It's a live modqueue and reply extension. It updates every minute or so, and makes popups to tell you when things in your subreddits happen (like reports, spam filter acts up, someone replies or PMs you, etc, modmail)  It also allows for mod tags. Like, I can tag someone here ""U Wot M8"", and you will see that tag beside his/her name, as well as a comment as to why I tagged the user.  It's mostly useful when you mod +2 subreddits, as it allows you to sort through modmail by subreddit, and gives custom programmable macros for each subreddit.  It also shows you your unmodderated submissions for each of you subreddits.  Basically, very, very powerful mod extension, but also can get really annoying."

ImaginaryEquestria,2hstce,Coelacanth0794,2,Mon Sep 29 16:34:15 2014 UTC,...that looks like an incredibly fun game...
ImaginaryEquestria,2hsa8v,Lol33ta,2,Mon Sep 29 13:18:07 2014 UTC,"RD is just being modest, she is beyond awesome."
ImaginaryEquestria,2hsa8v,CrystalLord,1 point,Mon Sep 29 15:43:40 2014 UTC,Borderline NSFW?
ImaginaryEquestria,2hsa8v,bvr5,1 point,Tue Sep 30 01:20:12 2014 UTC,I looked up the costume; it is supposed to look like that. Nothing sexual is being done so it's in the clear as far as I can tell.

ImaginaryEquestria,2hn307,xHaZxMaTx,3,Sat Sep 27 20:03:24 2014 UTC,Closest thing to the artist's actual name that I could find.
ImaginaryEquestria,2hn307,CrystalLord,2,Sat Sep 27 20:03:44 2014 UTC,"I'm betting the Crystal Giant would win.  No, I'm not biased at all."

ImaginaryEquestria,2hfuaz,CrystalLord,1 point,Thu Sep 25 15:58:11 2014 UTC,A link to his deviant art for the lazy.  I wish there were more Starcraft x MLP art out there... so much potential.
ImaginaryEquestria,2hfg15,Lol33ta,2,Thu Sep 25 13:37:01 2014 UTC,"Darling, while what you are wearing is certainly....creative, why don't we go back to my boutique and I make you something fabulous.     Oh! oh Idea! We'll go get makeovers to match your new look! No don't you worry about a thing it's my treat. As a sign of our new friendship. I won't take no for an answer. I insist! lets go!."

ImaginaryEquestria,2he5ui,Lol33ta,2,Thu Sep 25 02:49:10 2014 UTC,"Amazingly, this is the first time his artwork has been posted here. I suspect there will be more in the future."
ImaginaryEquestria,2hb3ke,xHaZxMaTx,2,Wed Sep 24 06:35:44 2014 UTC,Looks like a ponified version of the intro to The Grey. I'm okay with this.

ImaginaryEquestria,2h5zft,Coelacanth0794,2,Mon Sep 22 21:25:47 2014 UTC,I'm curious as to what the text beneath the image says. Anyone here able to read the proper Chinese dialect (I would guess Mandarin)?
ImaginaryEquestria,2h5zft,CrystalLord,3,Tue Sep 23 00:08:56 2014 UTC,"新春愉快，Pinyin: xin1chun1 yu2kuai4   It's another way to say ""happy new year"" (lit. ""happy new spring"")."

ImaginaryEquestria,2gz72f,Lol33ta,3,Sat Sep 20 20:15:04 2014 UTC,Artist DA  xpost from /r/ImaginaryOoo
ImaginaryEquestria,2gz72f,CrystalLord,2,Sat Sep 20 20:15:25 2014 UTC,"Subbed. I've come across quite a bit of AT content, perhaps I can post there. I've noticed you've been around /r/adventuretime a lot."

ImaginaryEquestria,2gyj8h,mronosa,2,Sat Sep 20 16:13:07 2014 UTC,"I imagine they step on them, and then use their mouths to pull them up.  Here's some art by DarkFlame that I think visualizes it pretty well."
ImaginaryEquestria,2gtpio,CrystalLord,2,Fri Sep 19 02:39:45 2014 UTC,The extra hair strands in the front were a nice touch. That flower as well :)
ImaginaryEquestria,2gtsuq,Torvusil,2,Fri Sep 19 03:15:31 2014 UTC,"Looking at his/her Tumblr page and Google links, I cannot get a concrete real name for this artist. So I went with ""Missy Birb"", the title of his/her Tumblr."

ImaginaryEquestria,2gqhhu,CrystalLord,1 point,Thu Sep 18 05:11:17 2014 UTC,She's very adamant about calling herself Dino. Perhaps it is a real name?
ImaginaryEquestria,2gq78g,Torvusil,1 point,Thu Sep 18 03:16:08 2014 UTC,i actually really like this one
ImaginaryEquestria,2go1ad,CrystalLord,2,Wed Sep 17 15:31:22 2014 UTC,I imagine this as your OC for some reason.

ImaginaryEquestria,2gmjez,Torvusil,2,Wed Sep 17 03:07:34 2014 UTC,"Hmm, she's also known as Mirapony. Could someone double-check and see if her real name is posted somewhere?"
ImaginaryEquestria,2gmjez,CrystalLord,1 point,Wed Sep 17 03:08:13 2014 UTC,"He's an Asian 22 male, known as Mira (Inkbunny account). However, Mirapony seems to be an alias, and I could not find a better name.  Thank you for commenting when you were uncertain, it really helps the process move along. You've proven that you in fact checked for his name.  It is possible his tumblr has some details in the history, but I didn't feel like sorting through the clop and furry porn, no offense. :P  EDIT: Age 22 might be inaccurate, but I cannot confirm otherwise."
ImaginaryEquestria,2gldv3,CrystalLord,2,Tue Sep 16 20:31:08 2014 UTC,"Huh. She has a unicorn's horn, but her wings are styled from trees with branches an leaves etc."
ImaginaryEquestria,2gldv3,Coelacanth0794,2,Tue Sep 16 22:46:25 2014 UTC,"I imagine the horn is wooden too. Her wings are growing out of her back, and end in long banana tree leaves. She's part plant here.  But that is really interesting. I guess AJ would be a neat goddess of nature."
