Move that another day.   DisneySea an all day event?   Up to you. it fills a day.   F 10/30 - Hakone Free Pass (following sample itinerary[1] on Odakyu website); Shinjuku; Tokyo Metro Gov't North Tower   The ropeway is closed because of volcanic activity.   Heard Tokyo subway/JR trains are brutal during rush hour. When should we avoid on weekdays? Or is that something we should experience once?   Depends from where you are from, but yes, the rush hour can be extreme. With kids, I'll certainly avoid, that would be abuse... Avoid 7:30-9:30, with the very peak being 8:30-9:00."
JapanTravel,3e5q0y,Titibu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:13:51 2015 UTC,"This is a somewhat ambitious itinerary with two young kids in tow, but you should have good (i.e. not hot) weather in your favor, and you don't have too many activities crammed into each day planned so you should mostly be fine.  Instead of hopping back and forth between Ghibli and Ginza/Yurakucho (I live here and I have no idea what there is to see there as a tourist besides shops I can't afford), I would consider going to the Nakano Broadway complex which is on the same Chuo/Sobu line. It's all anime and vintage western toys/games/etc; good shopping for the kids and good nostalgia for the adults.   DisneySea an all day event?   Absolutely. Also keep in mind that Disney does special stuff for Halloween (at least Land does, maybe Sea not so much) so they will be fairly busy, even on a weekday.   Will there be enough seats on Nozomi trains (they seem to run every 10 min) without buying tickets in advance?   With 5 travelers I would be prudent and buy tickets in advance, bearing in mind that you can get the tickets changed (so long as the new train you want has spots available). The J.League Cup Final is on that day in Saitama Stadium and if a Kansai-area team is playing there will be a lot of fans heading back around that time.  I would also consider boarding the shinkansen at Shinagawa Station, which IMHO is easier to navigate, than Tokyo.   Heard Tokyo subway/JR trains are brutal during rush hour. When should we avoid on weekdays? Or is that something we should experience once?   Heading toward the city: 7AM-9AM  Heading away from the city: 6-8pm but it very much depends on which line you're taking and which station you're boarding at. Even on my busy commuter line I can usually get a seat during rush hour by walking down to the middle cars rather than one near the front.  Rush hour honestly applies more to subways and few tourists ever have to deal with it; just make sure that you're moving your luggage during downtime."

JapanTravel,3e28tn,EmberHands,2,Tue Jul 21 12:51:47 2015 UTC,"Originally, I wanted to go because I was a huge nerd, started off with video games, and then later on, anime & manga.   I wanted to see the magical place where all these things came from. As I got older, and wiser, I became more interested in the history, and culture.   There's just so much to see and do in Japan. Also, the transportation system makes seeing and doing a lot of that, in a short time viable.  We went last October for the first time, and plan on going back. The highlights of our trip were spending time in/around the Gion area in Kyoto, and visiting Akihabara & the Ghibli museum in Tokyo."
JapanTravel,3e28tn,reol7x,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"Because it's so very different from anything in my own country. The culture is different, the food is different, the landscape/nature is different.   Being there made me actually feel like I was away from home. I'm from Europe and I've been to several other European countries and the US, and while those are different they still feel similar to my own country. In Japan it's different."
JapanTravel,3e28tn,Rhispa,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"The main thing for me was the influence of pop culture--I want to be able to stand there in that same country, that same city, and just sort of be there. In a similar fashion, I'm obsessed with the old (soon to be new again) show, Twin Peaks. Last summer, I finally went to a couple of the locations from that; it was very emotional for me to actually be where it all ""happened"" and see it with my own eyes. (The whole PNW is totally awesome, anyway, I highly recommend a visit.)  Besides that, there's also the shopping (although that interest has waned a bit over the years since we can now get nearly everything online or even in stores), the food, the marvelous gardens, the temples and shrines, the sheer scale and offerings of a city like Tokyo...that sort of thing. Hell, I'll be staying in a hotel near the busiest train station in the world. I'm sure it will give me no end of grief, but still, that's something to marvel at.  Even though Japan is considered in some sociopolitical ways a ""western"" country, it's still the most ""foreign"" country I will have ever been to. Yet despite my ongoing general fears about this trip (which seem to center heavily around ordering food), I'm comforted to know that I probably won't be in any danger. The low crime rate, cleanliness, and technological and economic development of the cities, along with the famous politeness of the citizens, can make it more appealing than some of its neighbors (and I'm not a weeaboo--I know it has its share of problems and assholes, but in general). Using English on some of the signs is a comfort, too."

The attention to detail Japanese people seem to put in everything.  The efficiency and scale of public transportation.  And the maid cafes.  ;)   I haven't been yet, but I'll be arriving in Tokyo in October.  Can't wait!"

JapanTravel,3e28tn,DevonOO7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"A very important point is that it is a country at the top economic level, so it can offer maximum change of scenery while enjoying the same level of comfort as any other country. Because when people from the USA, or Europe, for instance, go to another of these western countries, it can be very nice but not everything is different. In Japan, everything is foreign and amazing to discover.  And these things to discover are very diverse, because Japan is a top technological county while staying in touch with its tradition (which is also a very unique fact in the world). So you can be amazed at modern stuff in Tokyo and then soak in an onsen in a traditional ryokan in the mountain that makes you feel like you are going back hundreds of years."

It's just so fun being on vacation and spending time in Japanese bars. I was always the most popular person at smaller bars just because they found foreigners to be interesting and would buy me drinks for hours. It felt really good.

I had a friend with me who spoke Japanese-ish so that was convenient.  In March there is a festival just outside the city in the mountains. (I believe it's a Shugendo festival). They walk on hot coals and if you line up early enough you can too. (I don't suggest it as the line is like 4 hours and you have a poor view of the festival).   That is the only March specific thing we did, I think.   Weather was ok while we were there. I wore a sweater some days, it only rained 1 day. Pay attention to whether people are carrying umbrellas, the only day we forgot ours was the day everyone else had thiers.   The plum blossoms are starting but the cherry blossoms aren't close, so it's not impressive.   The March Sumo tournament is in Osaka not Tokyo so Sumo is kind of out."

JapanTravel,3e2nmi,asiageek1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"Two weeks in December for sure.  December is much colder than March, but one week is just not enough time to scratch the surface.  Plus Christmas in Tokyo rocks (lots of beautiful decorations, light shows, German-style Christmas markets, and strawberry shortcake).    I will say from December 28th - January 4th quite a few attractions and restaurants are closed, but just see those attractions that will close over that period before that, and there is still plenty to do and see during the New Year's holiday.  Also food in general does suffer over the New Year's period, since the even the chefs who are open for business don't have access to the Tsukiji Fish Market, so booking fish focused meals at the start of your trip is advisable, and then eat stuff like tonkatsu and monjayaki during the latter portion."

Christmas in Japan is a 100% commercial venture - the holiday illuminations are the only thing of interest, and of course Tokyo Disney Land/Sea get all dolled up. It's just another work day in Japan, while the Emperor's birthday (Dec 23) is a national holiday.  March in Tokyo is hit-or-miss; this year the high temperatures were very much above historical averages, but the low temperatures were below average.

If you compare the cost of the train to the hotel in Yoko, it'd be better to just go there from your apartment. It's not a long ride and it's wonderful to enjoy the view of the ride. Get a pass and just throw some money on it so you dont have to worry about having to constantly buy a ticket"

Most likely it would take you about half that depending.  It is much easier to get around at night.  I like to stay at the Yokohama Sheraton because it's right across the street from Yokohama Station but I don't know if I would if I already had something in Tokyo.

JapanTravel,3e20au,Analog18,4,Tue Jul 21 10:04:40 2015 UTC,"Entirely depends on your bank. I got a significantly better exchange rate at the 7-11 ATM than at Narita.  At the same time, I didn't trust my bank to allow me to withdraw what I needed, so I brought about $800 USD and converted it at the airport, and used ATM's for the rest."
JapanTravel,3e20au,reol7x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This sounds like a good idea. I'll probably just exchange some at narita and use atm for the rest of the trip. I also just remembered i got some ""okozukai"" from my family members too for the trip haha"
JapanTravel,3e20au,Tw1987,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:36 2015 UTC,I spent about 1800 - I did 1000 upfront which was spending money for the Kansai region - and then the other 800 at Tokyo. I was planning to spend up to 2000 of spending money but ended up spending less. Did this so i could budget half and half at each area.
JapanTravel,3e20au,otsukarekun,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think it more depends on your bank. My American bank (Chase), has a $300 per day withdrawl limit at ATMs.      It's probably safe enough to withdraw all $2000, but I personally wouldn't. There still is a non-zero chance of losing it or getting it stolen etc. It doesn't seem worth it just to save a hand full of $5 service charges."
JapanTravel,3e20au,ChefBoyAreWeFucked,2,Tue Jul 21 10:34:19 2015 UTC,"I personally had pretty good luck with 7-11, I did the math, and any fee I paid was small enough to be unnoticeable when withdrawing $200 or so.  Contact your bank before going to change your withdrawal limit if that's a concern.  Keep in mind, you'll only be estimating the USD you are taking out, so if you intend to withdraw just under the limit every time, increase your limit.  This may be less important with USD to JPY due to what the exchange rate happens to be now (slightly over 100/1, so withdrawing your limit in USD * 100 should be fine).  I used Japan Post Bank (ゆうちょ銀行) in the past, but their ATMs only accept PINs 6 characters or shorter IIRC, so I had to go with 7-11.  It was initially a bit scary arriving and encountering the possibility that I wouldn't be able to get any cash because of the length of my PIN, but 7-11 worked fine."
JapanTravel,3e20au,fotoford,0,Tue Jul 21 12:35:24 2015 UTC,You'll probably get a better exchange rate from BofA if you get all the cash you heed before you leave on your trip. Amble in to a branch and ask them.
JapanTravel,3e20au,gibagger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:44 2015 UTC,"In my experience, exchange rates are better at 7-11. Just take a few hundred dollars (200-400) cash to exchange in Narita just in case anything goes wrong. Banks sometimes have a penchant for blocking your account even if you let them know in advance. This happened to me last trip but luckily I had cash with me so I exchanged it for about 30k yennies, which lasted a few days."

That said the areas passes (which ones did you look at?) it's not like you need them for your 6 days? If you travel around Osaka for example I guess you will have to use subways which are not included in either passes. Or Kyoto... buses or taxis (or bike rentals) are the way to go. So adjust your itinerary I would say or post your whole schedule so we can say a pass makes sense or not.

JapanTravel,3e15al,otsukarekun,4,Tue Jul 21 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Just to break even, you need three longish shinkansen trips per week. It's not worth a JR Pass to just get around Tokyo. You can check google maps or http://www.hyperdia.com/en/ to see the train prices and compare them against your itinerary. If your destinations are a week apart, it is probably not worth it."
JapanTravel,3e15al,kaseijin64,3,Tue Jul 21 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's not worth it unless you do a crazy Shinkansen journey.   If I ever go back to Japan, I'll be getting a 1 week pass, but I'll be using it to literally travel everywhere during that week. I say it's worth it for a crazy Shinkansen adventure where you just go to far places and see what's there, but you could probably have more fun slowly going across the country and see what there is to see.   If I was in your position, I'd get a 1 week pass, do a week of scouting all around the country, then I'd take the slow train back to the places I thought were worth an extra look and take in all the little towns along the way."
JapanTravel,3e15al,kaitensoshi,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"Don't get a JR Pass if you're going to use it in Tokyo. It's totally not worth it! Get a couple of day-passes at most.  This isn't a good idea either. Many of the train/subway and bus lines in the cities you're visiting aren't JR-Pass compatible so it wouldn't be worth it to get it for each city/week. Get a city-specific day pass. You can check out the Kansai Surutto/Thru-Pass for Kyoto and Osaka. I think they have a 3 day version and a 5 day one which costs a fraction of the JR Pass. Well OK, the JR pass is (like what someone else said) really useful if you're travelling long distances via shinkansen/bullet train. The 7-day pass is barely 'worth it' for a round-trip from Tokyo to Kyoto and Osaka and back to Tokyo again.    Getting a JR Pass will only make sense if you plan your major travelling routes right! How are you travelling to Sapporo? By a domestic flight?   E.g.  If you were to travel by shinkansen from Tokyo to Sapporo, stopping over at a couple of cities in Northeast Japan along the way. I've done this before, and it's not too tiring if you space everything out nicely. If you're keen on doing this route for a week or two, then the JR Pass is very, very worth it."

Semi twin rooms are also pretty common, but these basically are for couples as the beds aren't really large enough for 2 people to sleep comfortably unless they don't mind being very close to each other.

It includes unlimited Karaoke, pool, arcade, a massage chair room, showers, etc. I've often considered overnighting there as an alternative to a hotel.

Not sure if you are planning on climbing Fuji or not? If so shelve your plans unless you are a very experienced climber. Fuji is very cold and dangerous outside of the summer climbing season. It's possible to climb in October but probably not a good idea. If you just want to go to the base or 5th station and hang around that's fine. If you just want good views of the mountain I suggest going to Kamakura, specifically Enoshima.   Kyoto is a doable day trip on the railpass, go from Tokyo station and it should take about 3 hours to get there. Osaka is doable as well.

August is a fine time to do it, but just be prepared, the peak is almost always freezing cold at night and the wind is very strong. During the day there are no trees so the sun is very strong.   I climbed it overnight for the sunrise and frankly I had never been more tired in my life, then I had to climb down, I can't really say I recommend it, but in August I'd say it's safe to climb. Just be prepared, bring lots of water, bring something to keep volcanic pumice from getting in your shoes, and take the ascent slow so you don't get altitude sickness."

JapanTravel,3e06z9,SarahSeraphim,4,Tue Jul 21 00:52:13 2015 UTC,"How do I get from Narita to Hanzomon station with the JR Pass and using as little money as possible?   The most convenient routes don't use the JR lines so you have to use Keisei and subway lines. You could take the NEX to Tokyo Station but you're still paying for the subway after that.  Sounds like you made the mistake of buying a JR pass without doing the research to see whether or not you actually need it. If the only trip outside of Tokyo you take is to Kyoto (and that's not really a day trip), you've actually lost money on the transaction.  Remember folks: If you need to ask ""Any MUST SEE _____?"", you haven't done enough research on your own."
JapanTravel,3e06z9,dokool,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info. Im trying to avoid taking taxis, which I hear are expensive, so using the pass + subway Im guessing is much more affordable.

JapanTravel,3dyovo,HerrCo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on how long you plan on staying in Tokyo, but if it's more than 2 days, get a SUICA/PASMO card (interchangeable). It's just a prepaid chargeable IC card, and you'll be paying full fare, but the convenience will be worth it."
JapanTravel,3dyovo,ukatama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:44 2015 UTC,Do you know if one of these cards also works in/around Makuhari?
JapanTravel,3dyovo,PlatinumMinatour,4,Mon Jul 20 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"All the main IC cards work nationwide since March 2013. You won't have an issue getting to, or around, Makuhari."
JapanTravel,3dyovo,ukatama,3,Tue Jul 21 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, they work nationwide (save for a few minor railways and bus companies)."
JapanTravel,3dyovo,SJ_RED,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:34 2015 UTC,"For within Tokyo and Osaka, subway+walking usually gets you anywhere you need to go. Because of that I would recommend getting a Suica card. These are chip cards that you can top up with money and check in/check out with at subway stations to pay for your fare.   I bought my Suica from a kiosk at Narita Airport when I arrived, but I imagine they sell them in Osaka too.   As for Osaka to Tokyo, probably the cheapest way to go is by train. Depending on budget, the Shinkansen might not be the cheapest option, a little under €110 if I recall correctly for a one-way reserved seat on the Nozomi. The Nozomi is the most expensive Shinkansen though, and reserving adds some to the price too.   My railpass had expired, I needed to go on one final Shinkansen ride to get home and I thought ""fuck it"". I didn't really mind as I could afford it, but for your friend it might not be the best.   Alternatively, there are regular slower trains that'll get you there, but prepare for several hours on a train if you go that option."
JapanTravel,3dyovo,mybigleftnut,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"Does the Suica card work in Osaka and Tokyo or just Tokyo, what about for Kyoto?"
JapanTravel,3dyovo,SJ_RED,4,Mon Jul 20 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"It definitely works in both Tokyo (where I bought mine, at a kiosk at Narita Airport) and in Osaka, as I've used mine over a period of two weeks in both with no problem.   In Kyoto my card worked for the subway and buses as well if I recall correctly."

JapanTravel,3dyovo,SJ_RED,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah, I was thinking about Pasmo Card as well. I couldn't exactly figure out how far the area in which I am allowed to travel would be — is Makuhari, for instance, accessible with the Pasmo Card as well? Or if there is a cheaper alternative for a period of time instead of  paying for individual connections?"
JapanTravel,3dyovo,reol7x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"I would honestly advise against Pasmo, as it is only valid in Tokyo itself. Suica is also valid in Osaka and as you'll be spending time in both, it would be a waste to get the Pasmo.  Scratch the above, as /u/reol7x said both Suica and Pasmo offer almost the same service since 2013-ish. Suica has… a cute penguin mascot? ;)  I do not know if Makuhari accessible via Suica or Pasmo, as I've never been there.   As for cheaper, going by subway is already pretty cheap compared to distance quickly covered. From my hotel (near Mitsukoshimae station) to Suehirocho station (the start of Akihabara district) is two stops, via Suica that costs 170 Yen which translates to €1.26. So if you want it any cheaper, you'll have to walk ;)"
JapanTravel,3dyovo,SJ_RED,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"I think all the IC card systems are interchangeable, at least, that wasn't our experience with Pasmo last October.   We used it throughout Japan, Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, & Kumamoto."

While in Tokyo, we were staying in the Ueno district (which has decent shopping/markets and the park) and made sure to visit some of the other nearby districts (all easily reachable by subway and walking): We spent a day in the Akihabara anime/gaming/electronics district, visited Shibuya for karaoke, sushi, and the famous busiest intersection crossing.  In Shinjuku, you can see Godzilla and there's a bunch of arcades, while Asakusa has an enormous shrine and the Skytree, and Tsukiji is the famous fish market.  The Imperial Palace, Meiji Shrine, and Tokyo Dome are all worth seeing, too. Once you leave the Tokyo area, heading south toward Yokohama, you can go to Kamakura for the Great Buddah statue, shopping, some awesome shrines, and the Walk of Hydrangeas. Farther west (reachable by an affordable train in ~2 hours) is the Hakone National Park with some really pretty mountains and the famous shrine on Lake Ashi.  You can probably also go to Mt. Fuji.  We didn't get to because it was closed to hikers while we were there, but you should be able to go if you like.  You can use this site for info about Fuji-san. We were down in Misaki, which is about 2 hours south of Tokyo and is a beautiful rural town/fishing village in Miura. If you have anything specific that you'd like to do, like hiking, shopping, or visiting shrines/gardens/museums, I might be able to recommend specific places for those activities.  The food is just amazing, everywhere.  We had traditional ramen (of course), soba/udon/yuba, sushi, okonomiyaki, tempura, shabu, mochi, etc.... eat lots of things that you can't identify, because they're usually really good! Our trip was so much fun- really take advantage of your time there and enjoy all the scenery and culture!"
JapanTravel,3dvzuy,UnexpectedDubstep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:47:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the info. I really enjoy hiking and I am planning to visit as many shrines and gardens as I can find. If you can point me towards interesting places that would be awesome!
JapanTravel,3dvzuy,Ghost772,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"If it's hiking, shrines and gardens you are after, then I would recommend Kamakura (off Tokyo) for hiking and Kyoto for the shrines and gardens. There are plenty of them to visit in Kyoto like Kiyomizudera, Heian, Kinkakuji, Arashiyama and more. The hike in Kamakura is pretty nice and you can stop by the (money-washing) wealth shrine in between the hikes."

JapanTravel,3dvzuy,UnexpectedDubstep,2,Mon Jul 20 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"Mostly by train, especially subway around Tokyo.  There is a very extensive train system throughout that region, and lots of lines that go to pretty much every city.  The trains are fairly inexpensive too, and you can take buses and walk to most places that the trains don't reach. This site and others are helpful for getting between and around cities."
JapanTravel,3dtzsq,suprazero,2,Sun Jul 19 13:22:51 2015 UTC,Well be aware that taking the loop line over the subway when you can will save you a bit of money.   Use hyperpdia or google maps to add up your cost of traveling for the day. If it is worth it to you then you can buy an unlimited day pass.   Scroll down to the special ticket section http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4006.html  Also tomorrow is a holiday here in Japan so have fun with all the crowds at the places you listed.

It's small, very very busy at weekends and I think you could spend your time better elsewhere. Though if you happen to like Naruto there is an exhibition near the aquarium (can't miss it) its amazing.   Namba is a great area for food, shopping and stuff. In Dotonbori there is a spa at the new Japan cabana where you can get a spa day pass (shower, pool, sauna, gym, erythang) for under $20. Wurf."
JapanTravel,3dtzsq,Nayphun,2,Sun Jul 19 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Personally I really liked the aquarium, what other aquariums have you been to to consider that one small? The centre tank was impressive with the two whale sharks and the jellyfish section was also incredible, I'm fascinated by nature so it was a must for me. There's also the massive ferris wheel but I can't vouch for the view because it was closed when I went."

I travel abroad to festivals all the time and this one is the first I'll be doing alone (the lineup more than makes it worth it though).. it's also a bit of a taster trip as I plan on coming back to Japan and doing a much longer visit.  I'm into electronic music, so Porter Robinson (Live) is my main one on the Saturday, and I love The Chemical Brothers + The Prodigy so I'm hoping I can catch both on the Sunday.

Shigaraki pottery is famous in Japan, and you can even make your own. Shigaraki is in Koka city which is famous for ninjas, and they have a ninja house and a ninja park (where you can study to be a ninja). You can also try the ninja park in Iga city in Mie prefecture.  From Osaka, I also recommend Nara. You can hit the top spots in a day if you plan it well.  You should also go to Himeji south of Osaka to see the castle."

JapanTravel,3dumf2,ThisIsSoWrong,3,Mon Jul 20 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"Uji, near Kyoto (20 mins in express train) has this street which is absolutely lined with tea shops. The shops also sell matcha-flavored goods such as ice cream, daifuku, cookies and your standard fare of japanese sweets. I'd suggest you to buy a good bag of ""shincha"" for your friend. Shincha is tea made with very tender leaves and has a very delicate taste."
JapanTravel,3dumf2,Bob_Slefty,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"On one of my trips I came across a tea shop in a shopping mall. Nothing super fancy, but they specialized in tea. They would make you a small cup of any tea you were interested in. If you can find a place like that (and they should be everywhere), you can actually try the tea before you buy it and bring back something for your friend that you picked yourself!  But yes, do consult the r/tea snobs."

JapanTravel,3du7td,Apocsky_,3,Sun Jul 19 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"You'll always have to tap out as you'll be transferring to trains owned by different companies. Many of the stations are 'connected' though, in that you'll tap out of the JR line and then just walk to a different part of the station to transfer to the Metro line. Depends on the station though, for some of them you would physically exit the station to get to a Metro line."
JapanTravel,3du7td,Fuuko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply! So there won't be scenarios where I would be able to walk across the station to a different platform, transferring from a JR train to a Metro/Toei train, without needing to tap-in and tao-out?   Another question: If I weren't too hard pressed for time, that would mean that buying a 3-day Tokyo Subway Ticket would serve my cause more, right?"
JapanTravel,3du7td,rainbow_city,3,Sun Jul 19 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"Since you're talking about tapping in and out, I take it you'll be using something like a Suica card?  If so, you can use that on any of the subway lines too.  If you think you'll be taking the subway multiple times during the day, sure look into the Subway Ticket, but it might not be worth the cost."
JapanTravel,3du7td,Fuuko,3,Sun Jul 19 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"No. As I say, they're owned by different companies so your fare needs to be paid to each one. You can transfer from one JR to another JR line without needing to tap in and out but not from a JR to a Metro/Toei or any other railway line.   I actually haven't a clue about the subway tickets sorry. I just used my Suica card for everything when I lived there."
JapanTravel,3du7td,RealArc,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah the concept is a bit skewed for me because in my country, different companies run different train lines but we can transfer from line to line and only tap out at the station.   So for example: Ueno station.  I exit the Ginza line platform (Metro), I have to tap out from Metro gantry, walk to the Yamanote line platform, tap in to the JR gantry, then I would be able to board the Yamanote line JR train?  Thanks for your patience. Trying to grasp the concept of transferring lines in a foreign country with a system I'm used to in my country."
JapanTravel,3du7td,Fuuko,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ginza line is underground at Ueno station so you tap out, walk upstairs to get to JR gate, tap in and walk to the Yamanote platform"
JapanTravel,3du7td,ukatama,0,Sun Jul 19 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I thought it was such that stations are internally-connected and there wouldn't be a need to leave a Metro station to enter a JR station."
JapanTravel,3du7td,ukatama,4,Sun Jul 19 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"You don't usually leave the station, you just walk to a different part of it to transfer to a different line."
JapanTravel,3du7td,Gurtang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on wgat you mean by ""Leave the station"". At a lot of the bigger stations, the ""station"" is one huge complex that houses multiple lines/companies. So you wouldn't be leaving the station building, but moving from one part to another. Which in certain cases can mean a mile-long walk."

JapanTravel,3dtqgs,rainbowsloth72,4,Sun Jul 19 11:16:30 2015 UTC,"Only a few hours allocated to explore the place will be extremely difficult.  Simply because you can easily be stuck in a store for half an hour, depending on your interests, and there's many stores around.  My tactic requires 1 full day to blitz through every store systematically (often unsuccessful due to time contraints), as I plow through each street and alleyway, making quick memories of what I'm interested in acquiring and rough price range.  The next trip is when the actual buying begins, as I have budget and try to minimise impulse purchases.  Often Animate, Gamers and Tora no Ana, have store exclusive bonuses for the same product on promotion.  This has stuffed me up on a few occasions.  I am fond of a particular music/manga artist, but each store offered different store-exclusive promotion goods with the purchase of the album/manga - but I don't need 3 copies, even though each of the promotional goods is very tempting...  OTL"
JapanTravel,3dtqgs,gisdaman,4,Sun Jul 19 13:23:25 2015 UTC,"Two good guides from Kotaku for games and anime/figures here!  For gaming, you want to hit up Super Potato (the most famous of the retro gaming stores in the area). You'll want a map, as it's not on ground level, you have to go up some stairs so it's easy to miss.   More or less opposite that on the same street is a HUGE store with a massive green sign called Kotobukiya which is stocked full of anime, figures, merchandise. It's massive and great. Also, find Mandarake. It's big, black and imposing but full of interesting stuff.  And, as others have said, just wander down the main strip (both Super Potato and Kotobukiya are off down a side street). It's basically ALL anime and gaming. You don't have to look for it.  Oh, and visit the Hey! arcade. It's the best.  Have fun!"

Choose a category and all the stores will appear on a map. Then just tap a store and you will get directions and other relevant informations about what the store offers. Using the app's augmented reality function you can see the direction and distance through a live camera feed.   The app is free and it works in seven languages including English. It's very handy!

JapanTravel,3dt6kp,xinganbaobei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:03:37 2015 UTC,So i would have to know someone that goes regularly to make a reservation with them?

JapanTravel,3dt6kp,xinganbaobei,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's totally impossible, but that is my understanding. Someone that has dined before or a regular can reserve and bring you as a guest. But if you are staying at a good hotel I would definitely ask the concierge (and even voyagin) to try to make reservations on your behalf. It doesn't hurt to try. If they have a good relationship with the restaurant they can work magic for you."

JapanTravel,3dst1m,pynchonwithit,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:43 2015 UTC,"Just remember if you've just arrived in the country, you will not have your JR Pass on hand. It will be a voucher. You have to find a JR office to exchange the voucher for the actual pass.  If you have a group and you want everyone to sit together try to reserve seats. It's not impossible, but don't be butt hurt if you have to split up.  If the queue looks too long, or you can't get everyone a seat, you can absolutely just wait for the next train. There'll probably be another one in 30 minutes. It's not a huge scramble as everyone is very polite, but there is a sense of urgency. I've seen people sit on their luggage in the areas between the cars next to the doors too. It's way better than standing room only on a train in Europe.  People will be getting off at different stops so you can probably snag a seat later if you don't get one right away."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,xinganbaobei,2,Sun Jul 19 03:29:29 2015 UTC,To reserve seats for the JR can you do all of them on the first day that you get there or are you suppose to reserve a day before or so?  Also should i buy the green JR Pass or the regular one for 7 days?
JapanTravel,3dst1m,mybigleftnut,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"I've only ever reserved a day in advance, but yes you can book farther in advance. This seems to be a good idea if you have a large party and want to sit together.   I've never ridden the Green Cars before. The regular cars have tons of room and are very nice and clean, you won't be disappointed. I'd spend that extra money on something else."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,xinganbaobei,2,Mon Jul 20 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you for the help."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,mybigleftnut,3,Mon Jul 20 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"To reserve seats for the JR can you do all of them on the first day that you get there or are you suppose to reserve a day before or so?   The times I did that, the time I exchanged exchange orders with JR Passes, I did reservations for all the legs of my trip (I went ahead and gave the clerk a printed sheet with all the train numbers, departures, and destinations). Like that I've never had issues in finding seats (and that was during the Obon season)."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,einar77,2,Mon Jul 20 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"It sounds more convenient that way, so i'll probably do it like that. Thank you."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,mybigleftnut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:01:44 2015 UTC,"Is it true that there's no point trying to get reserved seats that day?   Pretty much, yes.   Is it a queue or a scramble for the non-reserved seats?   A queue. With a lot of people.   If only standing room remains, can I ensure a seat somehow,   Nope.   should I choose to wait for the next train?   Yes, but the next train will have the same problem.   If you get on at a stop towards the end of a journey, are you just screwed?   If you are in the non-reserved section, you might get lucky with someone standing up.    any other advice apart from to avoid these situations at all cost?   Standing in the shinkansen is not as terrible as it seems. For instance, it's way, way more comfortable than a daily commute on a crowded train. You can just go between cars, maybe sit a bit on your luggage, move around, etc."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,Titibu,2,Sun Jul 19 07:33:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Part of this confuses me, though.  If it's a queue, and rather than stand on the packed train, I decide to wait for the next one - can I not be at least near the front of the queue, and therefore ensured a seat? Practically, I mean, not legally."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,Titibu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"Basically, there are signs on the floor regarding where you are supposed to be queuing if you want to be on the next train or the next to next. The people queuing in the ""next to next"" move to the ""next"" queue when the train departs. I do not quite get your question, it's a simple, organized queue, each one his turn. If you want to skip your turn, you just wait and let the person behind you get in front of you."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,xinganbaobei,2,Sun Jul 19 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"The queueing is a very proper line. The Japanese take it seriously. It's very important you stand in the long colored boxes marked on the ground for the correct car you are planning to board, and you do it in order of arrival so it is fair to other passengers. No cutting!   I've never seen an actual queue for a ""next to next"" train (sounds so japanese!), just people kind of hovering away from the actual queue lines. If this happens just make a mental note of who was there first and file in line behind them when it's your turn to get in the queue area for the next train."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,xinganbaobei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, you're painting the picture well - I realise now I didn't specify something.  I was confused when you said that you can't ensure a seat, even if you wait for the next train (moving further up the queue), because I'm picturing the beginning of a journey (when there's no-one yet on the train. Surely in these situations, you're ensured a seat if you wait until you're near the front?  just as an aside - I know this all sounds finicky, I'm really just trying to map it out and get specific, for future searchers as much as me"
JapanTravel,3dst1m,xinganbaobei,3,Mon Jul 20 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like, at least in my experience, queueing in the next line only to let people in front of you so you can be first in the next to next train queue, is bad form. There are other people properly waiting outside of the next train queue for the next to next train queue. Did that make any sense at all?  I think if you enter the car and don't find a seat and come back out, the queue for the next train will have already formed if it's a busy travel day, and you should wait at the end of this new queue.  BTW, are you actually going to be there during obon week? I don't think it's as bad as like Golden Week where the entire country has off, but perhaps someone else with more personal knowledge of obon week can advise. I realize you are planning for worst case scenario but I'd bet money you are worrying for no reason!  Japan-guide says: ""In 2015, the peak of the Obon travel season is anticipated to take place between August 8 and August 16. The busiest days are expected to be August 8, 12 and 13 with people leaving big cities and August 15 and 16 with people returning to the big cities."" With this knowledge you can try to travel in the opposite direction of big crowds... leave small cities and head to bigger ones at the beginning of the holiday and at the end flip it."
JapanTravel,3dst1m,Black-Box,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate it.  Personally, I am doing a few shinkansen trips that week. I'll be fine, I'm not really bothered by standing or anything. I'd just prefer to know what to expect, and like I mentioned the info online just seems to dry up if you're talking obon/golden week.  I mean there's POV videos on youtube of how to buy train tickets and how to eat bento boxes and how to direct yourself from train stations to hotels. All pretty excessive in terms of preparation, so when people just tell you to avoid something, you wonder how bad it must be."

You probably know it was one of the hardest hit areas in 2011 though.  The main issue will be the ferry (Ajishima line), there are only a handful per day (see the link for the schedule).  You can not make it in time for the first ferry at 9am from Tokyo. It takes almost 2h45 from Tokyo to Ishinomaki. To take the 11:30 ferry, say you need to arrive at 10:45 in Ishinomaki (it takes only a few minutes to get to the ferry , but there is no issue in taking a bit of slack). Taking the 7:36am Shinkansen will have you at 10:16 in Ishinomaki, in time for the 11:30.  Last ferry during the WE is after 4pm. That should leave you a few hours to explore the island. You'll be back in Tokyo at 8:30 or 9pm"

I'm not sure where you're from, but I guess maybe USA as you mentioned tipping? There's no need to tip at all here, but when you're paying, it's best to put the money in the small tray, or on the counter if there's no tray.   I don't think you need to worry about the two hands thing either - it's mainly for business cards/documents and that kind of thing. The cashier will hand you your card with two hands as a sign of respect to you as the customer, but I think it's totally fine to accept it with one hand and a small head nod as you say thank you.   To be honest I behave exactly as I would in my own country. I try not to be too loud, don't talk on the phone when on the train, wait patiently in queues, hold the lift for people who are trying to get on and off. I think day to day life is really similar.   Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about your etiquette, as Japanese people are very forgiving to foreigners, especially if you are obviously a tourist.   Have a fantastic time here!!!"

So you either catch the last train with thousands of others, party through or are near enough the nightlife you can walk home.   Taxis add a 20% surcharge for late night transportation. Taxis are a licensed business in Japan but  (afaik, uber doesn't exit in my country either) the general uber is cheaper by not being one... So in Tokyo they kinda had to partner with the legal taxis.

We could also see on the app where the Uber drivers were. If they don't work for Uber how would we see that? Perhaps they have a different car service contracted out to Uber. They absolutely were not the typical taxis you would flag down on the street. We took the same route, once with a taxi, once with an Uber. Uber was cheaper. We also checked taxi fare estimates before using Uber and Uber was always a little cheaper. Maybe it doesn't happen to be cheaper every time but the few times we used it it was. Perhaps it was because Uber didn't get lost, or took a more direct route."

The nice thing about Uber is you've already put in the app where you want to be picked up and where you want to be dropped off so you don't even have to talk to them. They just use their tablet or phone to get you where you need to go. The only time I said anything was ""Shinkansen, onegaishimasu"" on the way to Tokyo Station with our luggage and he knew exactly which gate to drop us off at so we didn't have to go far to catch our bullet train.   We mostly walked or took trains whenever we could, but on occasion we were pressed for time, or I was wearing heels, so we'd taxi or Uber. 2 taxi experiences got us lost since we had to tell them where to go, or show them a printed address. The very first taxi we got the night we arrived drove around our hotel in circles (we could see it from the taxi window 1 block over) as I was frantically yelling in my broken Japanese ""sutoppu! koko wa ii desu!"" for 15 minutes from the back of the taxi. Even his GPS system was telling him to turn where I was telling him to turn and he wouldn't stop and let us out. Being service oriented Japan, he was determined to drop us off at the front door, when we could've just walked over much faster. Of course that extra time added to our final bill. So then we tried Uber. They picked us up right outside our hotel front door, on time, I didn't have to say a word to him as our destination was already mapped out on his GPS."

JapanTravel,3ds6n1,shmelanie,-4,Sun Jul 19 02:39:41 2015 UTC,"I bought Yen today because I am betting that the Yen will strengthen before I arrive in February.  In other words, I am buying yen now while they are on sale."
JapanTravel,3ds6n1,shmelanie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:52:02 2015 UTC,For such a small amount ($485) you aren't really saving that much if the Yen does go back up in 6 months. Say it goes up 7 points in 6 months. You'll only save about $30. Then also consider banks here have a slightly worse rate than overseas and could charge a fee on top. You should call them to get the exact rates and any fees. I think it's only worth it if you exchange like $2000 or more. but if you have that much to start with its better to invest in some Japanese ETFs so you can lock into today's rate.
JapanTravel,3ds6n1,shmelanie,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"I bought 120,000 yen yesterday."
JapanTravel,3ds6n1,shmelanie,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:09:51 2015 UTC,I've been watching and researching the histories of conversion rates for the last two months and I think this is probably as good as you're going to get for a while. It won't probably go past ¥125 per $1 like it was in June again... At least according to all the articles I've been reading.

You could throw your luggage in any station since there's lockers at all of them (you might need to exit the station) so for convenience, maybe it's worth going to to Tokyo station first just to drop off your stuff.  From there you'll have 4.5 hours so you could really go in any direction to kill time. So wander around Tokyo station / Imperial Palace, you could go over to Ueno and check out the market or park, or go to Sensoji. Tokyo is so easy to get around I don't think it matters where you go the first day since you're arriving early.

The philosophers walk has a lot of temples along the route that you may or may not want to stop at (e.g. nanzen-ji is pretty great and you might want to climb the sanmon gate, visit the gardens next to it).  Higashiyama area also has lots of cool stuff you might want to stop at so maybe allow yourself some time to stumble into something interesting. Shoren-in and Chion-in are pretty cool. If you can spare the time then you can start off here, stop off for lunch at maruyama Park and head over to kiyomizudera. Gion is not too far. Pontocho is walkable from there.

If it's per person, I think it looks ok for a reasonable trip, it's fairly close to what I budgeted on my last trip.  *Admission: I would recommend adding a little bit of a cushion to the admission fees, you may randomly run across things you want to visit, maybe plan an extra 500-800 yen/day.   Food: It seems you've got roughly 4000 yen/day, that also seems reasonable for a day's worth of food. Some days I spent that on dinner alone, but most days, I think I spent no more than 2000 yen on food. Transit: Add a little more there; unless you're super specific about the when and where's, sometimes I found myself going extra places, or backtracking to something I was at on a different day. Oh, Kyoto has an all-day bus pass for 500 yen, just ask the driver when you get on. YMMV, but we used it a lot when we were there. Lodging: Do you have your lodging arranged already? (hostels, hotel?) I found lodging in Kyoto pretty expensive, you may need a bit more if that's the value for a group.   EDIT:    Time:  Yeah, you may not have enough time to see/do everything you've got planned. In theory it sounds doable, but in practice, probably not enough. You're not in a theme park with rides to check off on a list, you're visiting a new country exploring. You'll get distracted, or find things you'll want to spend more time at."
JapanTravel,3dmfp4,reol7x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed with others, you're not budgeting enough time for sites / transit.  When I was in Kyoto the distance between sites were much greater than they seemed on the map. I remember looking at Google maps and it showed that it was a quick walk. It was not, and I had rented a bike.  More importantly, with Kyoto I found I would look down a street and find something interesting so I kept getting sidetracked which was great. I found so many random things so I was pretty happy I didn't have a SET schedule."
JapanTravel,3dmfp4,MoneyWeHave,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:41:11 2015 UTC,You have grossly underestimated the amount of money you need the time you'll need to do all of the stuff you want to do.
JapanTravel,3doc7x,w4terfall,3,Fri Jul 17 22:25:41 2015 UTC,It really depends on your weather preference. It really is high 30s and humid every day unless it's raining. I'm from Boston and its like standing in front of an oven sometimes. Depends what you want to do here as well.   But if you don't mind being gross and you take it slow it's not like it will kill you.

JapanTravel,3doc7x,shmelanie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:35 2015 UTC,Yes it is. In August you should go somewhere warm weather is an asset (like tropical beaches and stuff). Japan is best enjoyed in the 3 other seasons.

My family (from near D.C.) came to Tokyo one August, and one member had to stay in the hotel for a day of the trip because of the heat/humidity. They swore they would never ever come again in summer.  Honestly, I've not done much international travel, but I would imagine there are much better places to go in August than Japan. Like others have said, Japan is best in spring or autumn and can be interesting in winter, but summer is to be avoided."
JapanTravel,3doc7x,imaginaryparakeet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm from Canada where -30 isn't abnormal for weeks at a time. If you really can't handle a temp extreme like 40 with humidity, then skip Japan in August. But, if you can adapt by ducking into little shops to stay cool, eating tons of fresh fruit, ice cream and drinking lots of water and Aquarius (Haters, come at me.), and actually being okay with getting rained on because it's warm and the rain is delicious in the heat when you're standing in a temple that's older than most of us in this sub, do it. Go for the adventure. Your hostel/hotel will have air conditioning. The shops and malls are all air conditioned. The sun goes down by 7pm so night time is the perfect time to go out and explore for food that would not make sense in colder weather (cold soba with fresh veggies and dipping sauce!) or to find a little backalley pub and sit on the street and eat food and drink until the early hours.  It's all about how you think you can handle it. If this is your literal one and only chance, take it. The beauty of the country will probably overwhelm you more than the heat and if the midwest is like Canada, the temp can only change so much before you just don't even notice it any more. (Usually right when -30 becomes -40 for us is when it just doesn't matter...)  But if you have time to go again in the future, then wait. Plan for November to May instead, you could even angle for going during peak cherry blossom season!"

Fukuoka is a lovely city. Nice streets to walk, cool shops, and lots of nice food. Tenjin is the main downtown shopping area. Lots of multifloor malls but also smaller side streets with funky shops. What kind of food do you like? There is a Fukuoka-specific chain izakaya (pub) called Futoppara that might be a good place to start, as there are multiple locations. Tonkotsu (pork based) ramen is the specialty with lots of pop-up street stalls.     Within the city limits there are nice parks like the ruins of Fukuoka Castle (Maizuru Park) and museums and temples, most notably Dazaifu. There is easy bus access to other awesome Kyushu places like Beppu in Oita, Mt Aso in Kumamoto, Nagasaki, or you could even hop down to Kagoshima on the Shinkansen. If you drive, there are lovely coastal roads going west out of Fukuoka into Saga prefecture.   PM me if you'd like some more ideas. I <3 Kyushu"

JapanTravel,3dmh21,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"I have three suggestions:   Usually to make women feel more comfortable using the shared onsen, some shared onsen do allow (or require) bathing suits and/or towels. I couldn't find any websites in English for these places, but here's a collection of such places in Kanto put together by a popular Japanese website: Big Globe Onsen. Keep in mind that I don't know if this would keep you from getting kicked out of a place that doesn't like tattoos. Find an onsen/bath that allows tattoos. I'm sure you're already doing that with TattooSpot and know that this is easier said than done. Go to a ryokan/onsen/bathhouse that has ""kashikiri"" baths. These are private rental baths (i.e., only you two), so you don't have to worry about other people seeing the tattoo and freaking out. Of course, it won't be quite the same atmosphere as a bath shared with others, but it's by far the ""safest.""   I found a Shirahone ryokan called Sansuikan Yugawaso that seems to have private baths for free for people who stay at their ryokan. Staying at the ryokan is pricey, though. You can find kashikiri bath at some daytrip bathhouses/onsen (where you don't stay at the hotel/ryokan and only pay for bathing OR where the place itself is only a bathhouse and doesn't have a hotel), so consider looking into those for a more reasonably priced option.  Good luck."

With the trip so near I don't see anything wrong with exchanging some of what you plan to take if you can get a good exchange rate to hedge against further weakening. It sucks you're going right as your currency is losing value, December of 2014 it hit a 7 year high, but at least you're getting around the average for the past few years and well ahead of where it was most of 2012. 10 year history  I'm planning for a trip next year myself and with the USD at/near the best exchange rate of the past 10 years I'm wanting to pull the trigger myself.

In investment terms, you're trying to time the market and that's never a good idea.

Roppongi has a bad reputation for drink spiking complimented with exhorbitantly expensive bills after a bad hangover. However, just be smart and ignore the touts typically coming from Nigerian bars. Not a city, but I'd recommend you check out Golden Gai in Shinjuku."
JapanTravel,3djci8,1PercentDivergence,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"In Tokyo I stayed in two hotels, one was in Shinjuku, it was a great location. Our hotel was directly linked to Shinjuku Station via an underground walkway so it was super convenient. Shinjuku station is on the JR Yamanote Line and I used line this every single day. It loops around Tokyo and will take you close to where ever you need to be. The second hotel in Tokyo was at the Tokyo Dome, so if you're looking for a few days of fun then I highly recommend it. It's surrounded by restaurants, arcades a couple of roller coasters and shops as well as being near Ueno and Akihabara so the location is also great.  Shinjuku and Shibuya have a great night scene - if you do go to Roppongi be careful of cover charges at bars or restaurants. You might think you're getting a good deal but when you try and leave they'll slap you with a bill for tens of thousands of yen.  I recommend making sure you know exactly what to do when you go to Osaka. In Tokyo, when we had some free time we always stumbled across something we wanted to see or do but it seemed a lot harder in Osaka."

Typhoons usually hit the coasts of Okinawa, Kyushu and Shikoku and cause strong rain and wind in wide parts or all of Japan for about two days. Luckily, typhoons are often followed by perfectly clear weather. The weather in September can still be quite hot and humid, but the crowds of August have mostly disappeared.  October is one of the most pleasant months for traveling in Japan as the weather remains warm, but is not hot and humid anymore. Trees begin turning colors in the northern regions and higher elevations.  November is one of the best times to visit Japan, as the weather is relatively dry and mild, and the autumn colors are spectacular in many parts of the country. Travel activity tends to be low except around popular autumn leaf spots."

Kobe and Himeji are nice and are directionally west. Avoid Kurashiki/Okayama... boring imho.

You won't have access to JR railway, or other privately-operated lines with this pass.  The JR Yamanote line is excellent, as it stops at Tokyo, Akihabara, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Harajuku, as far as Tokyo hotspots are concerned.  I rather just pay extra to travel more flexibly and efficiently. Remember that 6 days is very short, so saving time by spending less time on public transport, gives you more time to appreciate things while on foot."

If You can squeeze those places can be reached by Metro/Toei in three days, then it can saves a lot of money for you.  I thought in most case, you can take Metro/Toei rather then JR, but you will spends more time. Still some places like Mitaka, Nippori can be reached by JR only. For those case, you can also squeeze them into the same day and use this pass.  Another advantage to use pass instead of SUICA is that pass allow you the enter and leave the same station, while suica can't. So you can make use of the toliets, drinking fountain in the station."

We make sure the serious offending posts get taken care of, but there's really only two mods here to look after things. I know you're fairly active here, would you be interest in (another) mod position?  Anyways, I think the most appropriate response when someone is too vague or lazy is to just not respond at all.

JapanTravel,3deaaw,Flincher14,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"Once you both have degrees you can come teach English. That's about it. There is no other demand for your current skills, and a normal tourist visa is 90 days.   If you save up you could come to Japanese school out something together."
JapanTravel,3deaaw,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"JET will be minimum a year long so you're looking at a much longer commitment there. I've heard stories of couples getting placed close together and also stories of them being placed far apart so it's a gamble. Your chances of being placed near to each other increases if you're married.  I'm going to assume you're from America which wouldn't make you eligible for a Working Holiday Visa unfortunately (I'm mentioning this just in case you're not American).  You could both look for English teaching jobs by yourselves in the same area until you both secure jobs. You will need a degree to qualify for a work visa. You will likely be breaking your contract if you leave after only 3 months though. My boyfriend worked in one for a few months without ever signing a contract but he was on a WHV so there were no visa issues there.  WWoof is probably your best bet for a short term work/stay tbh.  For your future, becoming fluent or near-fluent in Japanese will obviously massively open doors for you working in Japan. There are some universities that have programmes taught through English though so definitely check those out and maybe what it takes to get there (PHD but not necessarily fluent Japanese). For example, I attended Sophia University in Tokyo where there were several non-Japanese professors teaching through English to both Japanese and exchange students. Stick with the Japanese for sure though as it really will broaden your options for the future if you do decide to relocate to Japan."
JapanTravel,3deaaw,Fuuko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could try working at a hostel (under the table. if you google hard enough I'm sure you'll find something.).. but I feel despite what you want to do, the toughest thing will be getting a visa for more than 90 days. Assuming you're from USA, the visitor visa is 90 days long, but if you wanted to stay longer you'd probably have to go visit a neighboring country for a little bit so you can re-enter Japan with a new visitor visa. I think any more than 180 days a year may draw Japanese immigration suspicions. Also keep in mind that the visitor's visa technically doesn't allow you to work anywhere. Like others have said... you could try looking into wwoof to work on an organic farm for your lodging. Last time I checked wwoof doesn't handle anything to do with visas so you would probably have to come with a visitor's visa..   There are other types of visas but they don't seem as feasible to obtain, or at least I don't really know of an easy way to get them. You could try to find work in Japan so that a company will sponsor your work visa (Maybe JET, ECC, or AEON to teach English for a year?). You could also pay money to sign up for a Japanese cultural class, which allow you to get a cultural visa (Japanese language programs, as well as other Japanese cultural courses). If your country has a working holiday agreement with Japan (USA is not included T-T) , you could spend up to 1 year in Japan doing whatever you want, including finding work if you want. Anyway, I hope that helps."

Ueno, per se, consists of the big park and a market district (Ameyoko).   Spring makes the park interesting because of the sakura, but that also makes it very noisy and packed. You can just pass by because its the area you walk to get to the museums nearby. Also nearby is a pond, Shinobazu, filled with lotuses.

I have been doing a lot of research as well as looking at other people's itinerary for suggestions and guidance. I was mainly worried about if I was seeing enough of Tokyo to get a 'full experience' and if this was feasible. Thanks for the tip on Omotesando Koffee
JapanTravel,3de8s2,amyranthlovely,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"Tokyo Skytree is not in the general vicinity of Akihabara. The Skytree is closer to Asakusa area (Sensoji), which you didn't put in your list of to dos. You can catch a shuttle bus from Akihabara or Ueno to Tokyo Skytree. Skytree is good at night. When it is too windy they will not allow people up. They will wait until the winds subsides.  I think not too many people know about the Bandai building near Asakusa. It's like a showroom with some life-size characters outside the building.  Nintendo stuff (the main office, and a sorta museum I think) is in Kyoto.     Imperial palace is a black hole, literaly. (Check Google maps) You can't really go inside for security reasons. You'll end up walking around the gardens. All you can see now are the moat and the foundations of the once proud Edo castle.     Your vacation coincides with Obon in Japan. Expect crowds an some of the attractions you listed."
JapanTravel,3de8s2,amyranthlovely,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think I'll definitely have to hit up Asakusa while I am near Akihabara. Thanks for the tip with the skytree, I was originally planning to go in the day, but now I'll have to see it at night for myself. Also do you know if the Asakusa Shrine is worth seeing?"
JapanTravel,3de8s2,CasualNerdAU,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:22:16 2015 UTC,Sensoji during Obon has some festivals. The temple grounds are open 24 hours but the prayer halls are closed. It is quite picturesque at night. No crowds.  Too bad you're leaving before the Asakusa Samba festival.
JapanTravel,3de8s2,CasualNerdAU,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:32 2015 UTC,Ooh! Thanks for the suggestion! Sensoji temple looks really cool. I'll definitely have to stop by while in Asakusa
JapanTravel,3de8s2,CasualNerdAU,2,Fri Jul 17 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Do you speak any Japanese? I only ask because I slept at that same manga cafe to get to Tsukiji early and there's no one there that speaks English. I had to use some of my poor Japanese because you need to sign up for a membership card to get a room.  After the tuna auction, see if you can get a seat at Daiwa Sushi (no reservation, there's just a line in front of the door). Freakin' amazing sushi and very reasonably priced.   In Ikebukuro I can recommend staying at Sakura Hotel if you don't already have a place picked out. It's just a few blocks from the station, it has laundry and wifi, it's cheap, and it has a 24 hour cafe with free breakfast."
JapanTravel,3de8s2,corialis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:43:36 2015 UTC,Shiieet. Unfortunately I don't speak any Japanese. I'm gonna rely on body language & a list of useful phrases so I can at least let them know what I want/am looking for and hope they'll understand. Also thank you so much for the food/sleeping recommendations !! Definitely will check them out ^ cheers

JapanTravel,3dcnsb,Hornstinger,3,Wed Jul 15 05:57:16 2015 UTC,"You will probably save some money with a 7 day pass, if you need to buy a 14 day pass you won't save money.   Shinkansen passes are expensive, but the Shinkansen are very expensive too, I think you will be riding enough to justify getting one, make sure you fit all the Shinkansen travel within a 7 day period.   Another option is Seishun 18, it's cheaper, but you can't ride Shinkansen and have to take slow trains, about a 12 hour trip between Tokyo and Osaka instead of 3. Also you need to transfer a lot, not recommended if you are unfamiliar with the train system.   Since you are traveling for only a short time, maybe spending more money for faster trains is better."
JapanTravel,3dcnsb,kaseijin64,2,Wed Jul 15 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't recommend the Seishun 18. It's really meant for students and other people with boatloads of free time and not much money."

I was freaking out that she might have DVT when she simply said her legs were swollen without telling me much else. I didn't get her message until she had gone to bed.  She believes her ankles swelled up from the sheer amount of walking and stairs that she is doing. It's her first overseas trip and she does not do any exercise back home, she literally spends all her spare time playing League of Legends... so I suppose her fitness has gotten a rude awakening with her tired feet and swollen ankles.

Maybe it's because I'm in my mid-30's, but that would kill me.  Universal Studios, in any country, is a day of standing in endless lines (although in November Universal Studios is a breeze in the US due to the Thanksgiving holiday).  But it sounds like you'll be traveling more between the cities than you will actually staying in them.

JapanTravel,3d9ked,benjaminbrownie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"One of my main concerns of this itinerary is that you didn't indicate how you would be getting from Hiroshima from Sapporo, it's a 14 hour journey using the bullet train. The JR pass excludes travel on the Nozomi and Mizuho Shinkansen which you would need to travel to Sapporo. If you were to take this trip, the cost of the JR Pass is almost half paid off to what you would spend on this trip alone, the 21 day JR pass is a really good deal at this point.  The JR rail pass for 21 days costs $466 USD, assuming you're traveling from the 7th, you'd most likely arrive in Japan on the 8th since it's a day ahead in most cases. Assuming you are flying into Osaka International here are a couple prices of the train tickets (which you said you are traveling too)without the JR Pass which.   Osaka to Hiroshima - ~$88 Hiroshima to Sapporo (14 hours) - ~$313  Sapporo to Tokyo (10 hours) - ~$192   I've lived in Japan and now I live in NY, I visit Japan a lot as well (Going August 4th-17th actually) and including Sapporo and Hiroshima visits I highly recommend traveling by air in this case. Tokyo to Hiroshima/Osaka and surrounding areas I think would be a more fun visit, plenty of stuff to do in Tokyo (Don't miss the Tokyo Bay Fireworks on the 8th! 12,000 shells!)  I think you should exclude Sapporo from your trip and focus on things to do around Tokyo, Osaka and Hiroshima. Just my 2 cents  Edit: Mt. Fuji isn't an easy mountain to climb, it is pretty damn high and you will need experience in mountain climbing to do so.  Edit2: If you're into Music, don't miss this!"
JapanTravel,3d9ked,Krynox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"Edit: Mt. Fuji isn't an easy mountain to climb, it is pretty damn high and you will need experience in mountain climbing to do so.   Depends really on the OPs physical condition. If they're physically fit they could probably do it. Most climb from 5th station anyways. If they plan to do a ""traditional route"" e.g. base to summit from one of the Sengen Shrines, then OP must be in tip top shape.  The OP should read up though. The Fuji-san hike/climb, with the big altitude changes, is not a walk in the park. Coming in unprepared will definitely ruin OPs day.  Try to avoid the Obon days. If you're comming from Tokyo, you'll probably end up using the Fuji-Yoshida (Mt. Fuji 5th station) trail. This will be the most crowded trail. Weekdays with no rain forecasts (or typhoons) will be the best option."
JapanTravel,3d9ked,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah we were planning to drive up as far as possible.  Everything I have read online seems to indicate it's doable if you go up slowly (most people sleep at some point?) and are in good shape, which I consider us to be."
JapanTravel,3d9ked,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"drive up as far as possible   That would be mostly to one of the four 5th stations.     There are mountain huts along the way. They serve warm food (some even have English menu), a place to rest, a place to chit-chat with other hikers/climbers. If you have reservations in the huts, you can sleep in a bed and have a chance to stretch the back. If it's full or you don't have any reservation you can try to rest at the benches outside the huts. Not very comfortable but it lets your legs rest a bit.     Pace yourself and bring coins! You need coins to operate the bio toilets (200yen) or buy (expensive) water from the vending machines at the mountain huts."
JapanTravel,3d9ked,tadpole64,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:52:42 2015 UTC,The JR pass can save a lot in travel costs. Although you will still need to pay for the super fast ones and for private cabins on sleeper trains. Otherwise standard seats on standard shinkansen/night services will be covered. Be sure to get a suica or a passmo as well as most lines are owned by rail companies other than JR.
JapanTravel,3d9ked,rukutksvo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, first thing you have to do upon arriving in the country, is to check and book the shinkansen seats as soon as possible. Especially for the trains, from Shin-Osaka to Hiroshima on 12th August,  returning to Osaka on 15th Aug (and preferably Osaka to Tokyo on the same day).  (As for the trains bound for North from Tokyo, I don't think you need to worry about too much since 15th Aug. should be off-peak then.)  I just checked how the seats on particular dates above are booked as of now, found out that:   On 12th Aug.(Shin-Osaka to Hiroshima) during 8:00 - 13:59(departure time), about half of the trains that are available for JR Pass holders (Hikari, Sakura, Kodama) are already fully booked, half of the rest have a few seats left. On 15th Aug.(Hiroshima to Shin-Osaka) during 12:17 - 19:11(departure time), half of the trains (same as above) nearly fully booked, half of the rest are fully booked.   Note that, booking shinkansen seats is only available from one month prior to the boarding date, which means reservations on the dates above have been made within just 4 days and 1 day respectively. By the time you land in Japan, more trains can be fully booked. That said, you can always hop on the non-reserved cars (every train on Tokaido- Sanyou shinkansen has non-reserved cars) though, if you don't care standing all the way, and sometimes, reserved-seats being fully booked does not necessarily mean that non-reserved cars, too, are packed. (People often make reservations just in case). Still, in the worst case scenario, dragging large luggage on a fully packed train can be pain in the ass. If you are traveling solo, all this might not matter that much, but you are not? right?"
JapanTravel,3d9ked,rukutksvo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up on the trains, I didn't realize they were so busy.

So, from Sunday the weather is going to be fine, just probably hotter than normal, since the day after a typhoon tends to be quite hot and humid.

JapanTravel,3d9pup,tadpole64,5,Tue Jul 14 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"When I went to Odiaba in Tokyo, a burger with fries and drink can cost upwards of Y1300 or about $13. As an Australian this seemed a reasonable price.   Elsewhere expect to pay upwards of Y600 (~$6) for a fast food meal, or upwards of Y100 for finger foods such as onigiri and corn dogs.  Small restaurants would be priced around Y900, Y10000 (~$9-$10). For the fancy stuff, such as Kobe beef or eel, expect to pay around Y60000 ($60).   Just remember that the some places don't display the 8% GST/VAT on the price of the meal.  Either way most food in Japan is good. Try going early morning to get the fresher stuff. Mid afternoon to miss the lunch rush. And late evening to see how well mannered most drunk Japanese people are.  Expect sandwiches with cut crusts, sweet breads, and lots and lots of coins after a few days of not wanting to hold the line at a convince store so you give the shop keeper a Y1000 note instead of counting out the Y1 and Y5 coins you cant get rid of because the vending or ticket machines wont take them."

These places may have an english button or a picture of the food if you cant read japanese. However most resteraunts have models of food in the shop window.   If you have a train pass like a suica or passmo you can buy food with it in some low end resteraunts, most convience stores, and most vending machines, as well as paying for a trip in some taxis. Depending on which airport you fly out of you can buy stuff at some duty free shops to get rid of any remaining money."

JapanTravel,3d9pup,folderol,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"The food is amazing! I had a short one week business trip but enjoyed myself tremendously despite the busy schedule. In fact I am already planning for a leisure trip this September, bringing my SO around for the Tokyo Game Show, Hakone Ryokan and Ghibli Museum.    Price wise, it really varies because I'm not sure where your tour guide is taking you to. I set a 40 dollars budget for just one meal at Tsukiji (~4000 yen) because the sashimi is simply marvelous there and for the Asakusa part, probably 20 dollars (2000 yen) because i went directly from Tsukiji afterwards and I was still full. Breakfast prices you can just try the convenience stores because they have a wide array of bentos, onigiri, desserts so definitely drop by if you can. I'll send you my imgur album so you can take a look at the prices link."

JapanTravel,3d9pup,broomless,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"usual tourist hot spots?   Depends on what you mean by this.  For instance, Asakusa, a major tourist location, is also a really old neighborhood with a huge local population and restaurants that date hundreds of years.  On the whole, the food is going to be good, great or excellent.  On the other hand, restaurants such as those in the SkyTree complex, which was created mainly with tourism in mind is going to be overpriced.  If you go to the countryside, where the restaurants rely on tourists, the food is going to be not as high in quality, and relatively overpriced."
JapanTravel,3d8v5s,SureMustBeNice,3,Tue Jul 14 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have been to Ayumi Hamasaki concerts five different times, I actually just came back from the last date of arena tour 2015 just 1.5 weeks ago!  There are many ways to obtain tickets, all with varying levels of difficulty.  The best way, is that Ayu now has opened up a global fan club. It costs 4200 yen a year, roughly $40USD, and this gives you access to ticket pre-sales for fanclub members. Not only will you get early access and get to pay the original price, 8,900yen per ticket, they usually give pretty good seats for fanclub members as well. I would definitely recommend this as your best option. I only just joined her fanclub so I could buy tickets this way for future concerts.  In the past, I have used ticket services like Celga and fdjp.com. I do not recommend using fdjp.com, they will do anything to rip you off and seem like a shady bunch overall.  Celga are much nicer, what you do is they identify a Yahoo auction that you want to buy, or give them a link to a ticket website where tickets are still available, and they will purchase on your behalf, as Japanese sites DO NOT ship to overseas addresses, and as such you need middleman services like Celga. So Celga buys on your behalf and it gets sent to their warehouse, and then they will send it to you, either in your native country or to your hotel in Japan.  The peculiar thing with Japanese tickets is sometimes some of them wont be ticketed/printed until 1-2 weeks out from the event date, to prevent scalpers. For example with Arena Tour 2015 the FINAL, because it was an extra added date, they didnt print any tickets until roughly a week before the concert. I couldn't buy on Yahoo auctions even if I wanted to.  So this brings me to the third option, is to buy it from ticket reseller stores in Tokyo. There are 3 Yokohama Ticket stores in Ueno, Shinjuku and Shibuya, and there is also Gorakudoh in Harajuku. They will usually be more expensive for good tickets, whereas crap tickets can be bought at the same price, sometimes even less than original price if they are desperate to sell!  Ticket prices can really vary depending on the date of the tour, whether its arena tour or CDL, how close up it is.... For example with the final date of arena tour 2015, there was a front row dead centre seat for 125,000yen, it was snapped up and gone within an hour. Last year I bought a fifth row seat for only 22,000yen, I thought that was INSANE and I was very lucky to get that as I have previously paid more to sit further away!  The ticket I bought this year was on the first level of stands, near the stage for 11,000yen, only 2k yen more than normal price and I could see everything quite clearly, was sitting directly in front of catwalk as well.  All in all, for Ayu I'd recommend joining her fanclub, the easiest way to get tickets and at the least cost as well. Also fanclub members get special stuff at the concert venue too, there will be lotteries or booths that only fanclub members can access."
JapanTravel,3d8v5s,hdfb,2,Tue Jul 14 23:45:43 2015 UTC,If you don't know anyone in Japan who can get you tickets you can use a service like this. I've used this service before and it was really easy.

JapanTravel,3d9r1v,momotaro-san,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:34:44 2015 UTC,"This info is all about the Tokyo summer sonic. I have never been to the one in Osaka.   Short answer is no.   If my memory is correct the ticket is twice as expensive. The only benefits are a sectioned off area near the front of the stage, and some premium seating / bar areas.   As long as you don't mind sitting on the floor there are plenty of places to chill out inside and out. So the premium seating is kind of a waste of money.  As for the vip area of the stages they are always in the front off to one side of the stage. Usually the left side. So if you want to be front and center it's a waste of money as you will be standing with everyone that bought normal tickets anyway.   The only reason to buy a premium ticket that I can see are if you want to get to the front-ish area of a show with less hassle. If you want to be front and center you need to come for the last 15 min. of the previous artist's set and then push the front when people leave, and then stand there and guard your spot during the 30 min break. which is a lot of time that you could be using to go to the bathroom or watch another artist.   Also, useful if you want to be very close in the pit (but again way off to the side) and not be squished. Especially for the headliners that play in Marine Stadium. I was in the pit for Jay Z one year and it was horrible, hot sweaty, stinky people all smashed tighter than salary men during rush hour, seriously, no joke. After that I have opted for low level stadium seats every year.   Over all I feel like you can get good or better seating for the normal price for most of the acts. All the best places to stand are first come first serve. And as long as you come early enough you should be able to get a decent space."
JapanTravel,3d6ijr,superintendentchalme,24,Mon Jul 13 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, they used to.  Five years into the Meiji restoration, the Meiji government decided to commemmorate five public parks in Tokyo; one of which was Ueno. A decade later, it was decided to build a railway station on the desolate hilltop at Ueno, which attracted poor migrants from Hokkaido and the Tohoku region. For decades, Ueno Station was the terminus for trains from the north, and the Yamanote Line's success catapulted the station's status.  The portion between Ueno and Tokyo was a freight line. However, after the Second World War, the government of Allied-occupied Japan ran passenger trains through this portion of track. This continued until the postwar economic boom (and the Shinkansen) reared its ugly head.  Eventually, Shinkansen trains replaced the need for long distance north-south trains around Honshu that departed from Tokyo Station. In particular, JNR proposed that the Tohoku Shinkansen would become the principal rail link between Tokyo and points north. Its right of way cut into the Tohoku Main Line between Ueno and Tokyo. As a result, the Ueno-Tokyo portion of the Tohoku Main Line was shut down to passenger service in 1973, and freight in 1983. The Tohoku Shinkansen of course started in 1982, with services extended to Tokyo Station in 1991.  This ended up backfiring since it screwed over commuters between central Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture. To help alleviate this, JR East opened the Keihin-Tohoku Line and Shonan-Shinjuku Line...which promptly became overcrowded to the tune of 150% capacity or more. In the early 90s, JR East proposed extending the Tohoku Main Line to Akihabara Station 2F and onward to Tokyo Station, but the residents in Kanda strongly opposed the measure.  A Ministry of Transport report from January 2000 (運輸政策審議会答申第18号) recommended restoring this portion of track by the year 2015. However, environmental concerns, budget overruns (the budget was originally 30 billion yen, and later increased to 40 billion) and the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake led to significant delays. In addition, there were only 3.5 hours per day alloted for construction. The new tracks were built as a viaduct over the Tohoku Shinkansen in small overnight intervals to avoid disrupting service. It really shouldn't have taken this long, I agree. The Ueno-Tokyo Line should have been done by 2007."
JapanTravel,3d6ijr,nostradamus1111,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:22 2015 UTC,"I have some follow up questions:  What attracted poor migrants from the north to Ueno?  When did the freight line between Ueno and Tokyo open, and was it switched to passenger usage before the war?  Was the original Tohoku Shinkansen plan in the 1960s going to terminate at Ueno Station, or Tokyo Station? If the latter, why did it take a decade for the Ueno-Tokyo Shinkansen tracks to be constructed? If the former, when was the decision made to remove the Tohoku Main Line tracks for the future extension to Tokyo Station?  From between the Tohoku Main Line's truncation to Ueno in April 1973, to the Ueno-Tokyo Line's opening in March 2015, which alternative Tokyo-Saitama commuter corridors did JNR/JR East create? How quickly did they become overcrowded? Did JNR get blindsided by how popular the Ueno-Tokyo portion of the Tohoku Main Line was with commuters between Tokyo and Saitama?  Did the Keihin-Tohoku, Yamanote, and Tokaido Lines have tracks separate from the Tohoku Main Line? That is, did the K-T line use the Tohoku Main Line between Ueno and Tokyo, or was there a separate right of way available between Tokyo and Omiya?  By the year 2000, when the report was commissioned, how overcrowded were train lines between central Tokyo and Saitama? Was the year 2015 estimate to reopen the Ueno-Tokyo portion an underestimate, and should it have been constructed sooner?  JR East approved the project in 2002, but construction didn't start until 2008 and took seven years. Why?!? Was it the tsunami? Was it the fact that construction took place when trains weren't running, in the overnight hours? Was it typical Japanese political inertia?"

JapanTravel,3d3axw,forbidden-donut,2,Mon Jul 13 04:33:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience, preplanning is the only way to gaurantee that you will have a room in Japan. I've never couchsurfed so I won't include that.   When in September will you go? There is a long holiday and if you will be there during that time, BOOK RIGHT NOW.   We made a mistake booking in Hiroshima during March. It was the beginning of Sakura season but not officially the beginning (no actual flowers yet) and we had accidently forgot to book the first night. We could not find a hotel under $400 within Hiroshima including on airbnb and hostels. We ended staying one shinkansen stop away and paid $275 a night. I've also had difficulty booking hostels in Nagoya if there is any school related thing going on, a festival, or a holiday.   Maybe other people have had different experiences than I have but I wouldn't leave it up to chance. One night I missed my train and ended up meeting up with a guy off Tinder (that I'd been talking to for a while) just so I didn't have to sleep on a bench.   Edit: It might not be as big of a deal if you are willing to spend the night in a internet cafe or 24-hr Manga cafe. I personally prefer to sleep horizontally."

It's no LoveMerci but the interactive dildo action sampler is pretty impressive by any standard as is the wall of anime-themed fleshlights.

I think there were a few more cities that we wanted to visit.  We wanted to visit Namariyama bay. We are not sure if that beach is public and usable for everyone.  Your assumption was right thou: 1 day for Nara and Kobe and 2-3 for Kyoto. 1-2 for Osaka max (because some sources say the city is quite bland)  Could you add a note why we should visit Kamakura / Yokohama ? It seems that both locations are only 1 1/2 hours with a train from Tokio. That's perfect for a day trip. We need to check/research what's worth seeing in both places (if you didn't already say).
JapanTravel,3d12g6,adam_364,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly can't say much about Yokohama because I haven't been there, but I've read that it's quite nice and all, so I guess it's worth a visit if you have time.  I really liked Kamakura though, one of my favorite parts of my whole Japan journey. The beach is really nice, especially with the two peninsulas you can visit. There's also interesting temples and of course the Big Buddha which is very nice. You might also be able to catch some fireworks or festivals, but I'm sure."

Not sure how far they are either.    http://hanabi.walkerplus.com/detail/ar0313e00881/  http://hanabi.walkerplus.com/detail/ar0313e00635/
JapanTravel,3d05gs,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"Both are relatively near Shinjuku.  The first one is on a river that divides Tokyo and Kanagawa. From the map of the event, it seems you can take the Keio line from Shinjuku to one of the stations nearby (Keio tamagawa). Then walk 10 minutes.   布田会場：京王線布田駅または国領駅より徒歩20分、調布駅より徒歩25分、京王多摩川会場：京王線京王多摩川駅より徒歩10分、調布駅より徒歩20分   The other one has weird transportation options. Trains then bus.   西鉄東大和市駅から西武バスイオンモール行に乗り30分 武蔵村山市役所下車徒歩15分、JR立川駅から立川バス箱根ヶ崎駅行または三ツ藤行に乗り40分 横田下車徒歩15分   IMHO it should be no problem even if you don't speak Japanese. Follow the crowds! Arrive early so that you can still find spots to sit down. Walk slowly. It's easy for a big group to get separated.  There will be festival food all around, hotdogs, yakisoba (stir fried noodles), cotton candy, and beer. You won't get hungry.  The public transportation (trains/buses) will be jam packed after the hanabi taikai!  If it rains, the event will most probably be cancelled."

Do you think for the first one i can do a half day in Hakone and then go to the festival around 4pm or maybe earlier? or should i just do stuff around Tokyo and then go there? What time would you recommend going there?  And thanks for the help btw."
JapanTravel,3d05gs,sessyargc_jp,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"Hakone area shops will probably open 10-ish. Some areas in Hakone are still closed off (e.g. ropeway) because of the recently high volcanic activity in the area. The ferry cruise seems to running though. IMHO if you do Hakone in the morning, you can go directly to Keio-tamagawa in the afternoon. Remember that the JR Pass does not cover the Keio trains. Check the Hyperdia link on the right panel to plan the train route.  I don't know how crowded this particular event is. 4-430pm if you have a big group that want's to find space. You'll be sitting on grass so bring a small ground sheet. 5-30pm should be OK if you're alone or just a small group.  The festival will start on time. Most of the time they will fire off blanks around 15 - 30 minutes before the actual start."

JapanTravel,3czgut,saytseff,3,Sun Jul 12 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"Estimate time of arrival from most sources (Japanese news, jma, and other Japanese weather sources) say the typhoon will hit Shikouku/Kyuushu around Thursday night (3 am on Friday). Which means, it will wreck havoc and be gone by the morning. It will go through Kansai (Okayama, Osaka) before turning North.  So, don't go outside when the typhoon is happening. The rain and wind are really strong. If you managed to not get blown away, or swept away by the water, you will 100% be drenched if you walk around outside while a typhoon is occurring. Depending on the severity of it, you may be asked to evacuate your area (due to flooding usually.) But, this is usually in remote and mountain areas. Typhoons can get pretty devastating in Japan, but they usually fly by quickly once it hits land."
JapanTravel,3czgut,kureejii,4,Tue Jul 14 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"Did you check Japan Meteorological Agency？  Nangka coming time is probably Thursday or Friday.

JapanTravel,3czgut,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:45:21 2015 UTC,"Looking at the forecasts now, it's still pretty far away from Japan. If it does hit, it won't hit for at least 3 or 4 days. If it does hit, you probably won't be in any danger though. It will be really rainy and windy. Most of the tourist spots in kyoto will probably be closed, but plenty of shops, restaurants etc. will remain open. So if it does hit while you're there my advice would be to hunker down in a bar somewhere near your hotel and just hang out. Typhoons don't usually stick around for more than half a day or so, so it won't completely ruin your trip."

JapanTravel,3cygta,GHDpro,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Those SIM cards aren't very cheap (if you want decent speed anyway), so $40 doesn't sound too bad.  I also understand why your leaders told you to leave your phone at home, I think they want you to concentrate on enjoying the jamboree and avoid scenes like this :)  This map I got from FB. No I don't know what the difference between the red and blue circles is. Or who even will get access, and if we all get access, how crowded (slow) it is going to get. So having a SIM in your phone is a good backup, probably.  Enjoy the Jamboree, cya soon"

JapanTravel,3cyihv,saibayadon,4,Sun Jul 12 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"do they stand still?   Yes, in places. If you get caught behind a large tour group in the rocky sections of the climb, you will be standing in line or just standing. This also happens when you get close to some of the mountain huts. After the Fujisan Hotel mountain hut at the 8th station, the trail becomes more crowded. Last year I hiked the Yoshida trail during Obon and the trail was three to four hikers abreast near the top. It was just before sunrise so it was very crowded and very slow moving. Please don't try to leave the trail as that often sends debris crashing down on the people below."
JapanTravel,3cyihv,Mametaro,2,Mon Jul 13 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, I guess I'll have to make do and bear with it.   Also another quick question if you don't mind. I was planning on starting my hike at 9 to 10am (So in theory I would be back to the base around 7pm), what do you think? I don't mind missing the sunrise at the summit."
JapanTravel,3cyihv,saibayadon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:39:17 2015 UTC,"I've hiked it during the day and much prefer it to hiking it at night. You will have less problems with tour groups and crowds during those hours. What time are you planning on arriving at the fifth station? You should give yourself at least an hour there to help your body acclimate to the higher elevation. If you are in really good shape, you might be able to do the hike in that amount of time. It usually takes three to four hours to descend at a pretty fast pace. You've given yourself about a total of ten hours minus the descent let's say three and half hours (four is more likely) and you have only six and half for the ascent. I think that is really optimistic. I would give yourself more time for the climb by arriving early at the fifth station and plan to catch a later bus down. (http://www.japan-guide.com/bus/fuji_season.html) Good luck with your climb!  /Don't forget the sunscreen and drink plenty of water during your climb. Save your energy and buy the water at the mountain huts. It is more expensive but it is worth the cost."
JapanTravel,3cyihv,Mametaro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the info!   The 7pm schedule was more of a ""how long will I be there"" more than anything else. I don't mind spending 1 or 2 more hours on the ascend or descend, so I will pace myself for better enjoyment."
JapanTravel,3cyihv,saibayadon,2,Mon Jul 13 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"Get to the fifth station earlier so that you can acclimate to the altitude. As you hiking to the sixth station, you will be passing the hikers that were on the mountain top for the sunrise. After the sixth station, the ascending trail and the descending trail separates.   Keep an eye on the clock as you descend, you don't want to miss the last bus from the fifth station. Also be sure to have enough water for your descent. The last place to buy water is the Shita-edoya mountain hut (where the Subashiri and Yoshida trails diverge). It is a long walk to the fifth station. You should also have a flashlight/headlamp because it will be very dark. There will be very few other hikers descending at this time. Again good luck with your hike! I really envy you!  /From experience."

I guess I'm just looking for advice from people who have done something similar or already live there and could give me some advice (I have asked my brother of course, but he was near fluent in Japanese when he went out, and he did a very different kind of working holiday than the one I have in mind)."
JapanTravel,3cydaq,Tw1987,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:39:46 2015 UTC,The point /u/its_real_I_swear is making is that absolutely no one here will tell you NOT to go to Japan because we all love it. We would be bias and wouldn't be fair to you

JapanTravel,3cydaq,Tw1987,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:37 2015 UTC,I think a good place to the askreddit sub. I am sure you will get some responses there - maybe [serious?]. The trip was so good I can barely think of any cons. Again I didn't experience day to day life there - but from a tourist point of view it was the best and definitely going back.   If i just graduated university and was single I would teach their for a year without a doubt - after the experience I had there.

JapanTravel,3cwcwh,Xelank,2,Sat Jul 11 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know when your trip is but basically, as soon as you get to Japan go to a JR office to make your reservations. That's the best you can do really - if the 8/9am happens to be full, there'll likely be free space an hour later so it's not really a big deal. Unless it's a holiday and you're looking to book a day or 2 before you travel.  But yea, I wouldn't worry too much about how much space there might be right now cause no one will know for sure until you get there. Just be a little flexible with your plan (prepare to maybe have to catch a 10am instead of an 8am for example) and you'll be grand!"
JapanTravel,3cwcwh,Fuuko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:10:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try and come up with back up plans if it got full.
JapanTravel,3cwcwh,Titibu,2,Sat Jul 11 10:36:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the date and trains. During some holidays (oBon, GW, trains towards Nagano during the ski season...), the earlier shinkansens will be packed and sometimes running over capacity. During ""normal"" times, it will be rare to have a shinkansen running at 100% and you'll have no issue reserving or just hoping on board in the non-reserved section. Worst case scenario, just take the next one.  If you are talking about the local JR lines in Tokyo,  8-9am is the peak hour, and if not during the holiday season it will be packed to a point where having some sort of luggage will be very inconvenient to you and others. Avoid 8-9am for your movements inside the city."

JapanTravel,3cwcwh,Black-Box,2,Sat Jul 11 10:35:52 2015 UTC,you can always get on a non-reserve car with your pass. just show up early so you're first in the queue to get a seat.

JapanTravel,3cwcwh,FliryVorru,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:20:58 2015 UTC,Yes. The trains can often be at capacity during peak times.
JapanTravel,3cwcwh,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the comments on here so far, but I think it also kind of depends on the train's origin and terminus.  I live in Niigata and 4 weeks ago I had to go to Tokyo for business via the Joetsu shinkansen. I left just after 8am and while the train was populated, it wasn't packed at all. By the time we got to Nagaoka (3rd stop), it was crowded. When we got to Takasaki (6th stop), holyshitfuckme I didn't know they could legally sell that many tickets. But that's the trend on that particular train and it's very consistent.  It would benefit you to ask about the specific shinkansens you plan on using, as each is a little bit different. I hope this helps in some way!"

JapanTravel,3cwyp6,Titibu,-6,Sat Jul 11 14:51:11 2015 UTC,We don't have anyone who speaks Japanese. Us being with a group of around 20 people made us think we might want/need to apologize to someone. This in combination with our impression that business cards are almost sacred in Japan made this for a nice solution in our mind.
JapanTravel,3cwyp6,JCreazy,14,Sat Jul 11 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"Business cards are important, for business. Not for visitors.  Reverse the situation, imagine a group of Japanese tourists, going to wherever you are from, and suddenly handing you a card written in your language with an apology. That would feel very weird.   Best advice would be ""don't act like dicks and don't be too noisy"", you're short term visitors, so everyone knows you won't be able to get the small subtleties.   Learn simple ""sorry"" sentences. Sumimasen, or sumimasen deshita if you feel you really need to apologize for the ruckus you made. That should be enough."

Nearly all of my friends who lived in Akita City have moved elsewhere, and the ones who still live there have small children, so they can't help. If you hang out near the station, though, you'll run into westerns who might volunteer their floor space. In the meantime, if you can't get a church to put you up, net cafes are cheap. I believe the Round One up there is 24/7, too, and if so it's a nice place to hang out. A bus ride from the station."

Winter's appearance seems to vary by a month or 2 each year, but it's probably pretty safe to aim for November!   As far as sushi goes, you can't really go wrong. Ramen has a lot of different kinds, and I tend to prefer the rich/thick/heavy type. How about you?   Samurai Soup Curry is a pretty special treat, but most soup curry places (Lavi Lavi, Ramai, Kokoro) are all really good! They each have their own styles."

You can take the Shinkansen to Hiroshima station and then take a bus right to the Atomic Bomb dome.  You can check that out, the gardens, and make sure to go to the museum and the victims museum (cant remember exactly what its called, but they had a victims museum when I was there in June).  If you have time, take a walk through town to the Bank of Japan building that survived the bombing.  Its empty now, but was interesting to visit.  If you need something to eat, I highly recommend going to Nagataya which is right across from the parks.  They have amazing Okonomyaki.  Even closer than Hiroshima, would be Nara.  Nice temples and sights to see there, also get to see the deer.  I believe there is a train that goes directly from Kyoto to Nara, but I went to Nara while I was in Osaka so don't quote me on that."
JapanTravel,3csj8a,Decivox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Nara over Hiroshima only because it takes quite awhile to get there. You could spend more time in Nara that would otherwise be spent on Shinkansen and buses. However, the museum there is great, solemn but great."

A cheap meal is about ¥700 (+-¥300).     That leaves you with about ¥9,000 per day for transportation, supplies, snacks/drinks, expensive meals or hotels, entrance fees, and other costs.

The sites mentioned already, www.jrpass.com and www.japan-rail-pass.com are both reasonable options with good reputations, although you may need to factor in shipping costs. For me, they have always been more expensive than the local authorised agents. Some travel agents near you may also price match. Depends on exact pricing, their policy, and where they source the passes from.    Pricing of the JR Pass tends to be fixed in Yen, so you can sometimes save some money if there are large fluctiations in the currency exchange as most authorised agents will have a set timeframe that they adjust the local currency pricing. Some might do it on a Wednesday each week or each fortnight, or once a month, etc. So you can sometimes find an ""old"" price which is cheaper than the others."

JapanTravel,3cnjrp,saytseff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:56:55 2015 UTC,"Going on a trip with my boyfriend. We've both been in Japan before. He has only traveled around Tokyo and I've been around traveling with the JR Pass before. I've actually visited most of these places before, so I thought I'd show him some of the other historical and cultural places that he didn't see so much of in Tokyo.  The only problem is now, that I look at it, I think it's maybe too cram-packed with temples, gardens and castles and not so much of the modern day-of-life that he wants to see.   I'm also a bit uncertain about my itinerary for the day in Takayama. We go from Nagoya the day before, travelling along with the Wide View Hida (is it covered with the JR Pass?). Is a half day enough to see the bigger part of Takayama? Also, are there places to store luggage at the JR train station?   Are there any suggestions or places that are worth mentioning according to you? Or any suggestions on things to strike out and replace with another destination completely?  Thank you!"
JapanTravel,3cnjrp,Bob_Slefty,2,Thu Jul 9 08:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, the Wide View is covered by your JRP.  There are coin lockers at Takayama Station but whether there are large enough ones available on the day you go is the question!  I think that you could spend your afternoon in Takayama visiting the Jinya and then on to the San-machi Suji area of wooden merchant houses and the sake breweries. End at the Yatai Kaikan, where the festival floats are kept.  The next day your schedule seems maybe too packed to include the morning markets, then go to Shirakawago and then go on to Kanazawa and do all the sightseeing you've listed. I don't think there will be time for all that.  The morning markets are interesting but I'd suggest heading straight on to Shirakawago, spend a couple of hours there and then head on to Kanazawa. You'd have time to visit Kenrokuen and stroll around Higashi Chaya-gai and Nagamachi before it gets dark."
JapanTravel,3cnjrp,Bob_Slefty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:32:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!  People seem to mention the Wide View as something extremely special? Should I book tickets for it in advance?   Our accomodation for the evening in Takayama is in the mountains, onsen ryokan with few rooms so few guests... I read that it would take an hour to 100 minutes to reach with bus. I don't want to be late for the dinner either. I was wondering, how long would say would take to leisurely stroll through these sights that you mentioned?"
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,InfernoBA,4,Thu Jul 9 00:00:44 2015 UTC,"Many, many places do not take cards. That was one of the major culture shock things I experienced as an American. Visa was best though with MasterCard being spotty. I was there 2 weeks and brought $500 USD cash so ~60k ¥ and I still had to withdraw 30k more. Your debit will work in Post Offices and 7-11 but post offices close very early. 7-11 was everywhere. If being robbed is what you're worried about, you shouldn't be.  You'll be fine carrying large sums of cash there."
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,Captain_America619,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:58 2015 UTC,"So you will most likely not be able to use your debit card, but your credit card will probably be fine.  You might want to phone your credit card company and tell them that you will be making charges in Japan before you go so they don't think those are fraudulent charges and freeze your card.  But it is incredibly important to carry cash around since not everywhere accepts credit. I usually carry maybe $100 equivalent in yen which is basically around 10000 yen. That should be fine for most of your meals and such eating out.  Most shopping places in the mall and such will accept credit, but at restaurants I suggest just paying in cash to avoid a pain in the ass."

JapanTravel,3cm5qe,PANDADA,2,Thu Jul 9 00:36:45 2015 UTC,"I would confirm with your bank. Even if it does work, there may be an international surcharge.  I went to Tokyo last year and my Master Card through Capital One did not work at Lawson at the Haneda airport, even though they had a sign that said they accepted MC (my credit card was notified of my travel too). So after that attempt I didn't try to use credit card for anything. I figured if it wouldn't work there, it wasn't going to work anywhere else.  However, I use a credit union and not a bank, so my debit card worked at 7-11 and ATM's in the airport to withdraw money and there was no surcharge at those locations. It all depends on your bank so it's best to reach out to them to verify."
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:05:34 2015 UTC,Well based on my experiences nope.

Make sure you know your daily withdrawal/transaction limit and your international ATM fee and take advantage of it. For instance if it's a flat fee, take out the max amount of cash you can each time. When you get low on cash you can supplement with card purchases at places that take them."
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,ninkobob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"I found having about $300-500 USD or so day was more than enough. Also, 7-11 were super helpful to get cash and a little food each morning. If you have not already found a credit and debit card that works abroad I recommend the Chase Sapphire (only used for bullet train tickets) and Charles Schwab Debit card. Both worked without fail for us while in Japan. I used NerdWallet to find these two cards. Oh I can't emphasise enough. Get a wifi hotspot! Was worth every penny!"
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,cynikles,0,Thu Jul 9 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"If your debit card is a visa debit you won't have an issue. I still use my Australian debit card here occasionally when I need to. You can use post office and 7 Eleven ATMs to withdraw cash should you need it.   However in saying this, I wouldn't rely on your card to go shopping. The major department stores should be fine, but the little grocery store and the convenience store will probably frown at you if you produce a card. Big companies should be okay with visa and the like. I have a Japanese visa debit card that I use and even then I try to use cash as much as possible because they are still a lot of places that don't have the facilities for it. That I've found anyway.   10,000 as a bare minimum to carry, but it depends on what you're going to be doing. If you do make cash withdrawals on your card you will be charged a conversion fee and a withdrawal fee so if you're worried about those bits of money disappearing, it would be better to hold more cash."
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,ukatama,4,Thu Jul 9 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every single convenience store accepts credit cards. Even local ones like SaveOn, Coco and Poplar."
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,cynikles,2,Thu Jul 9 01:20:03 2015 UTC,Really? I wasn't aware. I've never tried. I would still not recommend using one in any case as you run the risk of pissing off the others that are waiting as it invariably takes longer to process than cash.
JapanTravel,3cm5qe,ukatama,3,Thu Jul 9 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"It actually doesn't. No pin, no signature for transactions under 10,000 yen, just swipe through the machine and you're done in 5 seconds. A bit more time than, say a Pasmo, but quicker than cash."

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,PopeOfMeat,-28,Thu Jul 9 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"Just a tip, don't mention to the cops that you were drugged. There is a chance they might arrest you to ""investigate"".   Sorry to hear about your troubles, but there is very little chance of you seeing your money again."
JapanTravel,3cjjjp,Veraxnihon,26,Wed Jul 8 23:29:59 2015 UTC,"I think he should definitely tell them that he was drugged as it seems to be a known issue:  ""The U.S. Embassy continues to receive reliable reports of U.S. citizens being drugged in Roppongi-area bars. Most reports indicate that the victim unknowingly drinks a beverage that has been secretly mixed with a drug that renders the victim unconscious or stuporous for several hours, during which time large charges are fraudulently billed to the victim, sums of money are charged to the victim’s credit card, or the card is stolen. Victims sometimes regain consciousness in the bar or club, while at other times the victim awakens on the street. Assaults on Americans have also been reported in connection with drink-spiking.""

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,PopeOfMeat,-9,Thu Jul 9 09:26:11 2015 UTC,"Downvote the messenger all you want, but telling the cops you were drugged is never a good idea. In Japan, using a controlled substance is illegal, if it was unintentional, then they will probably let you off. But the way the cops see it, if someone comes in and admits to having something in their system that is potentially illegal, they might decide that's worth an investigation. To investigate they need to lock you up, give you a drug test, and figure out if you will admit to willfully slipping yourself a roofie and partying with hookers. Or maybe you'll stick to your story about getting drugged and robbed. Either way, 3 weeks in custody ought to clear it all up. This might not happen, but the chance that it might happen (and this does happen) means that you're better off not mentioning being drugged."

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,ninomojo,5,Thu Jul 9 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"Its a short story: He was out with some coworkers from his home university, one of whome lived in Japan. He did the mistake of being escorted to a bar in Roppongi (mistake 1) by someone he met that night (mistake 2), had a drink, noticed something odd was happening with his cognitive functions, paid for drink with card (mistake number 3), left, got worse, and realised that he had probably been drugged. So he goes to a police box and tells them in English first, ""I've been drugged"" and when the cops didnt understand, he tried to use katakana 「ドラッグ」they thought he meant that he had taken drugs, not been drugged. Locked him up and it took a week to find him (well, more like 5 days) and another week to tell the cops they had a visiting professor who was presenting at a up there Japanese university. So many hoops had to be jumped through just to convince the police that he wasnt a drug lord.   So yes, in my opinion, you should not flat out tell the cops anything about drugs unless you know the actual verbage of being unwillingly and unknowingly drugged / spiked. Even then, bring lots of info to back up that you are a good guy and want to get to the bottom on this 60,000yen charge. Oh and bring a native japanese speaker. But I would go to the embassy first to tell them whats up; They might even have a police liaison for these kinds of crimes."

He went to the cops, out of his mind saying ""drug"". What the hell? The cops obviously arrest him because hes saying ""drug"" to them. What else are they going to do?

After ordering water (I paid by cash) I remember going to the toilets, as I turned around it looked like someone followed me in then quickly turned around. I then looked at my water and left it there as I think I started to feel strange. The next thing I remember is being on a bed naked with a prostitute. She offered me a drink which I refused and asked for water, then I have a memory of picking up that drink and her stopping me from drinking it. She asked me to put my phone, wallet and other things in a plastic bag. I have very brief memories of sleeping with her (sti check when I get home :/ ), being at a cash machine and her telling me how much I needed to withdraw, then her saying time was up and I could get the first train now. My memory of this point is a lot better so whatever I was spiked with was wearing off. I asked her how much I had spent and she told me she thought it was around $500 for two hours. I said I didn't remember and she told me she didn't know why. I  have no idea if she was involved in spiking me, spiked me again or found me at the station. As I left there was an old Japanese guy outside who said thank you, I went down a ramp and found my way to the station.

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,njtrafficsignshopper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:59:31 2015 UTC,Atom has three floors. Harlem is next door and there are a lot of other clubs in that area too.
JapanTravel,3cjjjp,yb0t,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:59:27 2015 UTC,I remember it was next to a club that was 6k/7k yen to get in that I skipped as it was a steep price. It's possible it had more than two floors as I only remember two
JapanTravel,3cjjjp,Aynatix,0,Fri Jul 10 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure it's not ATOM. I am very friendly with all the DJs.  I have a lot of respect for all the people that work there. ATOM is probably one of the LEAST sketchy places, if not sketchy at all.  If anywhere is sketchy, I would say gas panic. Vision, Asia, Atom, and Womb are all pretty responsible."

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,yb0t,19,Thu Jul 9 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"This happened to a buddy of mine recently, even for the same amount.   He went to his embassy (New Zealand) and they said they couldn't do anything. The cops basically told him it wasn't worth their time to investigate as the amount of money wasn't that high. And his bank (a Japanese one) refused to reverse the charges.   I wouldn't expect the cops to do anything, and whether your embassy can do anything is probably up in the air. That said I'd still go through with opposing the transaction through your bank, they probably have the greatest chance of being able to help you."

They were at a sports bar (was it the same one?!) and they think maybe the staff were jealous of them being with a couple of girls.    Anyway, luckily the larger of my friends took the spiked drink. The other friend is pretty small so who knows what it would have done to him. He felt pretty horrible for the rest of the day.    Edit: The staff weren't Japanese."

If you're still in the Shibuya area, I can meet up with you some time tomorrow and talk to the police.  Not sure how much they'll be able to help getting your money back, but at least the place might get investigated, especially if they keep getting complaints from the same place.  I helped a couple guys from the UK a few months back with something similar, except rather than getting drugged they just got locked in until they paid up an extra 40k.  They said their insurance covered it, but it doesn't sound like you'll have luck with that or with getting the transaction declined..."
JapanTravel,3cjjjp,tokyohoon,3,Thu Jul 9 08:00:24 2015 UTC,"Japanese national here. Read this post and your comment and sorry to hear what happened, but your story has a lot of holes. Did you wake up at Shibuya station? Atom is a pretty big club and I really doubt a staff member there drugged you. Possibly yakuza at the club? Were you at a hotel or in a shady room? If you were in a shady room, sounds like you walked in to a massage parlor and you most likely didn't have sex, especially in the state that you were in. They don't need to have sex if you were that incoherent. Also, if you pulled out money at the ATM, you maybe shit out of luck since you withdrew the money yourself. Do you have a receipt or copy of the bank statement that says otherwise? You might get the money back on your card though. The 60,000 exact suggests you were in a fuzoku, massage parlor establishment that determines price based on how drunk you are though. You should contact police and your embassy as quickly as possible."

JapanTravel,3cjjjp,Aynatix,2,Fri Jul 10 07:04:47 2015 UTC,"I've went over the night in my head a lot and it does seem unlikely that it was the staff that served me (I guessed it was as the blank out happened around 20 minutes later). I'm now fairly sure someone followed me in to the toilets and put something in my drink there as I foolishly put it down for 30 seconds (i have the image of a Japanese man around 5 foot 8, bald head and broad/chubby in my head). I remember having a drink, thinking it tasted weird and putting it down. I'm not sure if I got out of there fast or told someone I thought my drink was spiked as I don't think the guy found me.. I'd guess the girl found me at the station or whoever spiked me took me to her so I'd think I had a crazy night. We definitely had sex. It was a shady place with a tiny bedroom and shower and there was an old Japanese guy sat outside when I left. Slightly north east of station if my memory is right, yakuza place? I can mostly just guess the details as I have about 2 minutes memory of four hours"
JapanTravel,3cjjjp,ExtremelyJaded,5,Fri Jul 10 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"As long as the ""club"" was not some tiny 5-seater in a dark basement, but a proper club, they are probably the second stop you should make (after the police).  I can't believe a large-enough club would do that as a matter of policy (being known as the club who spikes your customers' drinks and overcharge them is not a very good long-term strategy), so it's likely a rogue employee. If so, there is a chance they'll make some effort to help you sort out the situation.  If they are unhelpful, you should at least post their name here. There aren't that many nightclubs in Shibuya, so it would be helpful to future travellers.  BTW: as others have pointed out, the receipt has zero mention of a shop name (or yours). Which is a bit unusual. I assume you kept your card on you at all times and are positive the only possible time they could have done this, was when you handed it out to an employee? If so, they may very well have had their own debit machine or some other trick to avoid bringing the club's attention to them…"

JapanTravel,3cm8lj,Archon7,5,Thu Jul 9 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"I know NZ summers are mild, but Japan isn't at the point where you'll just die in the sun. There's a lot of good things to do during the summer time and as long as you keep yourself well hydrated, you can enjoy yourself. 2L of water in Japan is about $1 so that isn't a major problem. Lots of drinks out there as well that help you maintain your natural salts and...stuff as well.   The only thing I would be worried about is the rain and the possibility of typhoons. It is around this time that you'll have some typhoons coming through and causing a bit of havoc (the majority of them stop around Okinawa, but we still cop wind and rain in Tokyo). This is just a maybe though.   All I can say is, dress light, drink plenty of water and enjoy the shade when you can. Otherwise, make sure you have a few activities lined up that can be done indoors."
JapanTravel,3cm8lj,cynikles,2,Thu Jul 9 00:42:51 2015 UTC,Not sure why someone down voted you but yeah that's some good advice.

JapanTravel,3cm8lj,2014timesaday,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"We are yet to see blue sky   It is rainy season now. It usually ends around 7/19 in the Kansai area, (http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html) but often ends earlier.

Enryakuji on Hiezan is about 10 degrees cooler so consider that as a day trip. Kurama-dera as well! (though not JR pass eligible they are totally worth it)"

JapanTravel,3cm8lj,-nautica-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every single convenience store sells umbrellas cheaply, so you'll be fine. :)"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,Shleepingbuddah,2,Wed Jul 8 20:16:33 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're visiting during quite a humid period! Be prepared. Always have some kind of a small umbrella on you.  1) Tokyo Bay Fireworks: It will be packed just like any of the other major Tokyo fireworks display. If you want a good spot anywhere, you'll probably have to secure a spot by early afternoon.  There are a few official viewing spots that require a ticket that you must obtain through lottery (I think only open to Japanese residents via web or mail.) Toyomi Sports Park is an official viewing spot doesn't require a ticket, but you better get there by early afternoon. It's accessible by Oedo Subway Line off of Kachidoki station.  Another good spot is Odaiba Park but this part will also get pretty packed early in the day (like noon, at the latest). I hear that the crowd in Odaiba Park will be ""couple""-ey than others, since Odaiba in general is a dating spot.  Make sure to bring some kind of a picnic blanket (or a tarp/plastic sheet?) to claim your spot. There are some onvenience stores (7-11, Lawson, etc.) or even grocery stores (nice thing about Japan in general is the bento-culture, so you'll find lots of ready-to-eat food-straight-out-of-the-box options) to keep you entertained and stuffed.  Any other spots around the bay won't be that optimal, since there will be a bunch of buildings in the way and you won't get a full view of the displays.  And make sure to allocate plenty of time for the travel home. The crowd to enter the subways/trains will be insane, the trains will be packed to the point where you'll be crushed to death, etc. It will all happen in a civilized, calm manner, however.  2) Daimonji Gozan Okuribi  You can pretty much see them anywhere. The best spot is along Kamogawa River for one of the characters (""Dai"" that looks like a stick-figure person). I'm not sure if any of the areas offer the views of all 5, but even if it does, you'll probably be super faraway and it won't be as impactful.  And I wouldn't make this a huge deal to be frank. Yeah, it's kinda cool, but the novelty wears off after seeing the fire for about 10 minutes lol. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Kyoto with all the yatai (food stalls) selling all the delicious street foods.  3) Kyoto duration It obviously depends on what you find interesting, and how much you want to get done in a day. Given that you are staying quite a bit of time in Japan, I think 5 nights is plenty - IF you can even find a room. You're traveling during Obon season, and with only one month out, I'm not sure if you'll be able to find decent hotels at a reasonable price at this point. You might have to book a hotel in Osaka and commute to Kyoto (15 min from Shin-Osaka station to Kyoto by Shinkansen (bullet train). I was able to do Kyoto in like 2 days.  4) Osaka Osaka is nice. You'll have to research more on Japan-guide.com to look at each of the distinct areas within Osaka to find what you'd like. The Osaka Castle is essentially a museum shaped like a castle, by the way. And constantly packed with tourists from China. Universal Studios is also fun, esp with the Harry Potter section. Make sure to buy the Express Pass to skip the lines since it'll be August.  And as far as places to stay in Osaka, stay near Umeda area (centered around Osaka Station) or somewhere near/inside the Kanjo Loop Line. Area around ""Shin-Osaka"" (note thta it's different from ""Osaka"") is boring as fuck, but I guess it'll be cheaper. Make sure to visit the Umeda Sky Building!  5) Other cities Hiroshima - Kind of a magnet for attracting foreigners for the Peace Memorial Park and Miyajima (island off of Hiroshima). Miyajima has the gorgeous Itsukushima Shrine (with the Torii gate out in the water) with some nice hiking trails. It takes like 2 hours from Osaka on the Shinkansen, so I'd recommend it as a day trip.   Kobe - It's about 20 min by Shinkansen from Osaka. Known for Kobe beef, obviously. So if you have the cash to spend, definitely try some of that. There are many restaurants serving authentic Kobe beef. Definitely doable as a day trip from Osaka, and I wouldn't allocate more than a day.  Yokohama - About 30 min away from Tokyo. Has the cool Ramen museum (kind of silly though. Not really a museum, but more of a themed food court. I love the ramen from Komurasaki, which is a Tonkotsu ramen with the roasted garlic chips. SO GOOD. There's also the Chinatown (Chinese food there is better imo than China lol), Sea Paradise (shopping mall/amusement park/aquarium, a huge date spot), etc.  Kanazawa - 2-3 hours from Tokyo on the Shinkansen. Has the Kenrokuen garden, lots of historic attractions, etc.  Nikko - 2 hours north of Tokyo via Tobu Line. Lake Chuzenji, Yumoto Onsen (hot springs resort), etc. It's a bit more developed/touristified than say, National Parks in the US but it provides some ""nature"" entertainment.  Hakone - 2 hrs southwest of Tokyo via Odakyu line. Another hot springs resorts with the views of Mt. Fuji.  Nara - 1 hr from Osaka. Deer park, big Buddha statue, etc.  Sapporo - Major city up north in the island of Hokkaido (northern most of the four main islands.) You'd probably have to fly into New Chitose Airport (I'm sure you can find airfare as cheap as $50 bucks each way on a low-cost carrier like Peach or Vanilla Air; most are around $100.) You can also visit Niseko, which is nearby. It's like a Japanese version of what Montana is like. Definitely a slower pace than other major cities.  Okinawa (Naha) - Definitely a different vibe than the rest of Japan in my opinion. Again, you should be able to find cheap airfare.  Definitel look into cities in Kyushu as well (Kagoshima, Miyazaki, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and their neighboring leisure areas.)  6) Other general advice: Bed/hotel: There wouldn't be any problem having two guys in a single-bed room. But make sure to pay attention to the bed size. ""Semi-double"" is usually sold for two-people, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want decent sleep.  Breakfast: It can be hard to find restaurants open before 10 or 11am, so I'd try to book a hotel plan/package that includes breakfast. There's also the option of getting some food (bento, spaghetti/noodles, etc.) from convenience stores (which are marginally better than the ones in the US. 7-11 sandwiches actually taste good in Japan.)  Restaurants: If there's a line, it'll be decent. The exception would be if you see a bunch of non-Japanese people in line - who obviously google searched ""Best affordable Kobe beef"" in English and decided to line up for the first search result, etc. If you see a bunch of Japanese men in suits in a line out the door for a restaurant around lunch or around 6-8pm, you can guarantee it'll be affordable and delicious... But another thing to watch out: I went to an area in Osaka with a bunch of revolving sushi restaurants near each other. I popped into one of them, but didn't have the patience to wait in line for 20 minutes, so decided to go into a place across the street. Turns out the sushi was pretty crappy and looked stale.  The ramen at Ichiran (can be found in a bunch of places throughout the country) was godly, and beat any ramen in NYC. I love Japanese curry, too.   And definitely try some Michelin-starred restaurants (there's SO MANY of them in Japan) and go in during lunch time when the prices are more reasonable."

The gay climate is pretty nonexistent - just be respectful of the culture. Its definitely not like New York City when it comes to openness. In Tokyo check out Shinjuku Ni-Chome we had a lot of fun at the bars there. Careful which ones you go to they're not all  accepting of foreigners.   As far as Osaka goes I could have skipped it for something else. Its much more laid back than Tokyo but I had the least fun there - the aquarium there isn't bad though. I'd replace Osaka with something in nature like you wantd to do."
JapanTravel,3clbsc,space_honey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:19:14 2015 UTC,"Seven days in Tokyo sounds good you definitely be able to find a lot of stuff to do everyday! Where in Tokyo are you staying? I was just there only for three nights and there was no sign of boredom since every main district has so many things you can do throughout the day. As some people mentioned Shinjuku/Shibuya area has a lot of great bars and stuff but to be honest there are great bars everywhere you just have to know where to look. I'd recommend looking down small streets around your hotel or even asking your hotel what they recommend.   With Osaka it is a lot more laid back than the other main cities and you can sort of use it as a place to take a break. There are a lot of hidden bars and a famous shopping area as well (though if you feel like shopping wait till Kyoto that place is amazing). Whilst in Osaka though you can use it as a base camp for example Nara and Hiroshima are easy day trips with the bullet train!  Kyoto is as amazing as you have heard. Amazing sights, both local and touristy, really cool heritage since it was the capital for 1,200-1,300 years and the people there are really friendly. As mentioned shopping in Kyoto is amazing and very easy to cruise around. They have a lot of local clothing stores and second hand stores at really good prices.  Some places I would recommend would be Hiroshima, Matsue, Sendai, any onsen (public bath) village in Nagano or if you're interested in Buddhism a small town called Koya-san will blow you away, its the most sacred area in the religion.  Lastly in regards to homosexuality in Japan it is not very common. In main cities it would be fine but if you go to smaller, local places (mainly those with an older population) as crappy as it is to say I'd say stay away from showing a lot affection. Unlike other parts of the world its still something that not a lot of people have accepted there yet. Don't let that scare you though you'll still have a great time!  That aside it sounds like you have a pretty great trip planned out :)"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,donouan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"About receptiveness of gay couples: any public displays of affection are not really well-liked or common, regardless of orientation. But you shouldn't run into any issues; Japan is super safe and they have made a lot of recent advancements in glbt rights (couple things in the courts right now that I have my fingers crossed for).  Sounds like you got your festivals covered, but I would suggest leaving earlier than you think so that if (when) you get lost/need to find a better spot, you won't be stressed for time. If you do get lost or need help, some Tokyo stations and hotels have tourist helpers. I've stopped at a random hotel to ask questions in Tokyo before because they are willing to help foreigners.  Kyoto is the shit. Tokyo is the metropolitan center and Kyoto is the cultural center (all the temples and gardens you could ever desire). I would highly suggest taking day trips to Osaka and Nara from there, but no need to stay in either place.  As for another place to stay, I would highly suggest going to Hokkaido if you can swing it. It's very different than either Tokyo or Kyoto, so you will get another type of cultural experience for sure.    Best of luck on your trip! It sounds like a blast, and I suspect you'll both have a great time :)"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,Ginsbergs-girlfriend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  So for the Tokyo Bay Firework Festival, where is that located? I've been to so many fireworks in Japan it's hard to know which one it is so if you could tell me the location I probably know a good place there. Also standard time to arrive if you know where you're going is around 5 PM or earlier to get a nice seat for a picnic blanket or a bamboo mat(which is basically a must bring)  Personally I've never been to Kyoto so I can't help there.  I've heard people say Kyoto is great, but if you're more of the party type people then you might want to go back to Tokykok for your extra 10 days before your flight and there's plenty of great clubs and drinking spots or other things to do.  Oh and climate for gay people is well.... It really depends.  If you don't look asian or Japanese then I'm pretty sure you'll get a Gaijin Pass because sometimes guys do this to be cheap. But also a notable thing is that many many hotels in Japan (Tokyo at least) are charged by how many people are staying not by how many beds.  So if you pay for 2 people you'll definitely get two beds anyway. When I stayed in a hotel in Tokyo for a bit I paid for one person but got a two bed room anyway so I think you'd be fine.  If you don't have an idea of what you want to do in Tokyo I could absolutely help you guys find stuff to do. I'm finding stuff for myself to do on my trip there in a week anyway so I bet I could find some great stuff for you to do."
JapanTravel,3clbsc,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there!   I've found this info on the location for the fireworks:  Harumi Event Area (Harumi Athletic Field 5-9 Harumi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo)  Access: 15 min. walk from Kachidoki Station on Toei Oedo Line, or 20 min. walk from Toyosu Station on Yurakucho Line.   Sorry but what exactly is a Gaijin Pass lol?  Definetly looking for ideas on what to do in Tokyo! I study architecture and would love to visit some more modern buildings that may be famous but arent temples? We both love japanese food, any place for especially good eats on the cheap side? We also love pokemon haha. Bar suggestions are welcome, probably wont be partying too hard but will definetly check out the scene ;)  thanks!"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Ah the fireworks there was one of the ones I missed going to last time, but my friends say that they found tickets for a boat ride that goes past the fireworks so basically they were almost under the fireworks that were exploding and they said that it was amazing.  Also Gaijin Pass is basically foreigners get away with anything kind of thing.  An AMAZING place for modern architecture would be Odaiba. Basically all of Odaiba is really new so all of the buildings are beautiful including the Convenention center and the Fuji Television Broadcasting building (The one with the big ball in the middle of the building). You would also definitely love Sky Tree as that was a pretty glorious building and it has a beautiful view. Tokyo Tower is also a pretty dated version of Sky Tree.  For Japanese food you have to try going to this place called ""Shakey's"" it's basically a pizza place that depending on when you go has a buffet style of Japanese Pizza and Pasta and Curry(all of which are like my 3 favorite foods) and you can get unlimited food eating which is amazing, and if you go later on you can order pizza and such without having the buffet and such, but it's a good chain restaurant.  If you want a bit more of a fancy food place you should check out this place in Takatanobaba called JoJoen which is like a table top grill place and it has simply the best meat you'll ever taste. It's a bit pricey so I only go once every visit to Japan, but it is super worth it. Not really fancy as in dress up though, you can wear casual clothes.  Also if you like pokemon of course check out the Pokemon Center in Tokyo.  Since I'm 17 I've never been to a bar and such, but alcohol is cheap cheap cheap in Japan. That shit is as cheap as soda in a lot of places and it is amaaaaaaaazing. (Plus they don't give a fuck about the drinking age and sell alcohol to kids as long as they say they're getting it for their parents are shit)  But alcohol is plentiful in Japan everywhere, but the downside to that is that it's almost all the same draft beer. Not much variety and foreign beers are pretty expensive, with the exception of some mildly priced Russian Beers.  Also a fun night everyone loves under the influence of alcohol is Karaoke. Best thing ever with other people so you should check that out. There's Karaoke everywhere in Japan.  I think I'll have more, but if you narrow down what you want to visit I could provide more tips and such, just ask me anything and I'll answer"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,ukatama,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"You realize that Shakey's is an American chain, right?"
JapanTravel,3clbsc,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:36:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's different in Japan.  I haven't seen one outside of New York though.
JapanTravel,3clbsc,Dark51d3,0,Wed Jul 8 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"That's the same thing like saying, ""7-11 and Denny's are American."" They are very different in Japan.   For sure, TGIF is American in Japan. But I usually recommend, to American visitors to Japan, to try 7-11 since they aren't the same."
JapanTravel,3clbsc,ukatama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well, first, you're comparing 2 different things.  7-11 and Denny's, for the Japanese territory, is a case where the rights to the trademark were bought out and operates completely independently from their US counterparts, whereas Shakey's (and TGIF) are operated under franchise licenses.  And, second, I was merely pointing out the absurdity of recommending crappy pizza (no matter how different) in a country full of great food.  One meal wasted on a Shakey's should be spent eating something great.  And if weird pizza is what you want to experience, then the major delivery chains all have much better options."
JapanTravel,3clz85,PitchforkEmporium,2,Wed Jul 8 23:09:14 2015 UTC,Hi there! I could help you around Tokyo personally depending on when you're going!  In Tokyo there's a LOT of stuff open on weekends and walking tours and bus tours are pretty shitty. But I could suggest a lot of things to do
JapanTravel,3clz85,orangefreshy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"I had more time than you when I went, but we basically researched sights and restaurants we'd want to go to and kind of grouped things together geographically - so for example, we did Meiji shrine and gardens, then went to harajuku straight after, walked around, found a restaurant to eat at, etc as part of 1 day. We didn't plan everything out 100% though but had a few must-do's and sees. Exploring was half the fun, really and a lot of the things the guidebooks suggest are true - there are certain neighborhoods or alleys, etc that are really worth a walk and checking out.   That being said, have you checked out Viator.com? They have a lot of different tours and activities at different price levels, all with reviews so you can get an idea. Maybe you'll find something you like there. You could even just use the descriptions as an idea and put a plan together to explore yourself!"
JapanTravel,3clz85,SJ_RED,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"Another user recommended Meiji Jingu (a Shinto shrine, located in a forest and visually and audibly cut off from the urban area of Tokyo). I can vouch for that, it is a peaceful place to visit and well worth your time.   For a busier one, travel to Sensō-ji (a Buddhist* temple, surrounded on all sides by buildings)."
JapanTravel,3clz85,ukatama,2,Thu Jul 9 00:17:46 2015 UTC,Senso-ji is a Buddhist temple. Ji (寺) is temple. Though there is a small shrine towards the rear of the temple.

JapanTravel,3cjz9f,Foobyx,2,Wed Jul 8 14:34:45 2015 UTC,My vote is for Osaka if you're looking for a bit more laid back atmosphere and more outgoing locals.
JapanTravel,3cjz9f,KingDog554,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:53 2015 UTC,"You're not going to get away from foreigners by going to Osaka. There is a foreigner community in every decently sized city.  Since you don't speak any Japanese and aren't staying very long, I would recommend looking for international type groups, often centered around a sport or other activity, that have a mix of foreigners and Japanese people. If you're looking to make Japanese friends, this type of group is more likely to have Japanese members who speak English.  Personally, I think that, especially if you haven't been, Tokyo is the place to go. In such a large you can be sure you'll find things to do that align with your interests."
JapanTravel,3cjz9f,chazchaz101,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Osaka. As part of Kansai places like Kobe, Nara and Kyoto are nearby. The people in the city are lovely, nightlife is awesome and theres loads of gaijins. It's smaller and more down to earth than Tokyo and that why I prefer it. Osaka really did steal my heart whilst living there."
JapanTravel,3cjz9f,Suminoekoen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"If you have to choose strictly, Tokyo is better because it's whole prefecture, not just one city as Osaka. You can go to Tokyo islands or different lakes and mountains of Tokyo."
JapanTravel,3cjz9f,Rambalac,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:06 2015 UTC,If you love cities like NY SF Chicago go to Tokyo. Osaka/Kyoto (really near eachother) are a better balance of mixing modern/ancient activities.

JapanTravel,3cjz9f,Titibu,0,Fri Jul 10 08:00:05 2015 UTC,"There is not much (nothing) in Osaka that you won't find in Tokyo. Osaka itself is smaller than Yokohama which is a suburb of Tokyo, so there's that."
JapanTravel,3cjz9f,PitchforkEmporium,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet you'll basically be there the whole time that I am!  But I'll be in Tokyo so of course I would suggest Tokyo.  Honestly while you're in Tokyo you won't see that many foreigners, me and my little brother always play a game of find the Gaijin and sometimes the whole day can go by without seeing any tourists.  I honestly think you should go to Tokyo though, it's very English friendly because all of the metro has signs in English so you can navigate the metro with ease, there are plenty of Homestay things you can do or go to a Gaijin house which is kind of where you just stay with a bunch of foreigners in a house for as long as you need and you're all basically room mates. There are people from all sorts of countries just staying there and it's basically dirt cheap to stay there.  If you want any help finding stuff to do I can help with that!  And if you want someone to show you around some nice places for you to hang out I'll be in Japan up till the 26th of August.  But honestly I think Tokyo would be best for someone who doesn't speak Japanese at all."
JapanTravel,3cjg2g,touch_my_tra-la-la,3,Wed Jul 8 11:32:14 2015 UTC,I do love Tokyo and can go there over and over again but I would advise you to include some Kyoto and more of the Kansai area.

I don't know if this is a popular suggestion, but I think you should look into staying at an AirBnB while you're in Tokyo. Usually the rates are comparable to hotels, and there's a bit more freedom. Plus I enjoy the feeling that you're ""living like a local"", staying in an apartment and living in the neighborhood. It might make your trip more enjoyable! I'm going to be splitting my time between an affordable hostel, and a nice apartment I found in Minato ward.  Maybe try to find somewhere in between two different subway or train lines so that you have multiple options and more flexibility in travel.   Like someone else said, I would also encourage you to head to Osaka a few days earlier so that you can spend some time enjoying the Kansai area and visiting Kyoto as well, before you fly out to Ishigaki.  IDK if your flights are booked, but maybe give yourself one extra day in Osaka after you fly back just so you aren't jumping straight from the flight onto the train back to Tokyo."
JapanTravel,3cjg2g,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! Where are you travelling from? We're actually going to be primarily using AirBnB for our stays in Tokyo. From what I've seen, we've found some pretty decent places from $50-90 in the heart of the areas we would like to stay in.   Your advice about Osaka is definitely something worth considering. I think we'll definitely stay a night on our way back from Ishigaki (yes we have our flights booked) and I think it's a good suggestion to go a few days earlier to check out Kyoto and the Kansai area. Luckily, we have a lot of time to play around with!"
JapanTravel,3cjg2g,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:59:08 2015 UTC,"So for while you are in Tokyo i know of a hotel called the ""ARC Hotel"" which is always a reasonable price and is pretty foreigner friendly. They have breakfast and internet included which is great.  It's located in Higashi-Ikebukuro which is basically in the heart of Tokyo and is walking distance from Ikebukuro which has a huge train station that has many many number of different number of lines going through it so it's a great place to transfer trains and go to all sorts of places. So it's a good location and the hotel has everything a hotel should have for a reasonable price."

However, if you were focusing say on Shikoku Island you could do a good 3 week backing trip and cover a good portion of it, especially if you stuck to something like the 88 Temple Pilgrimage trail. (I tried to link to the Tourism Shikoku page but it seems to be down, if you google tons of information will come up about the walk/hike).  You should check out the various regions and pick one area to focus on so you don't lose so much time in bullet training around the country to stuff a bunch of sites in since it seems you are more wanting to just experience the local areas.

At the main entrance there is a big open area with some buildings and lanterns giving it a nice atmosphere.  Another good suggestion I've heard others say before is to go to Hakone outside of Tokyo and stay overnight at a traditional japanese hotel (Ryokan). If you book well enough in advance you could get a room with a private hot spring bath and a view. I think this could be a really nice romantic setting for asking her if you want to make it a more personal affair :)."

JapanTravel,3cjb6z,llbdtiberio,2,Wed Jul 8 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"Hakone is just the most well known national park and has a lot of ryokans meaning you can see some nice nature during the day and chill out in the ryokan at night :-) I'd think that any nice ryokans with a private hot spring will be perfect, not sure if there are any in Tokyo though."

JapanTravel,3cjb6z,Bob_Slefty,3,Wed Jul 8 19:30:12 2015 UTC,You must go some places where are famous with  Autumn leaves.     Kyoto is best.  Nikko  is good. Shosenkyo(near  Kofu) is ok.  Mt.fuji with snow is beautiful .Onsen(hot spring) is must. Matsutake(high price mushroom) is a good food which you should try to eat in Autumn. ( but the smell is high price smell)    Many other Autumn Japanese foods will make your situation successful.
JapanTravel,3cjb6z,2014timesaday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:26:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I would love to see Mt. Fuji with snow.  We were already planning on going to an onsen when we're in Japan, but we don't know which one yet.  Haha, I love mushrooms, but my girlfriend doesn't like them. I will try to taste matsutake, thanks for the tip! ;)"
JapanTravel,3cjb6z,Gurtang,2,Wed Jul 8 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's no problem at all about proposing anywhere you like, so no need to worry about that.  As for exactly where, I think that what constitutes a romantic location may vary from person to person to some extent. Odaiba in Tokyo is a popular place for proposals among Japanese but I'm not sure that it would be my choice.   If you're in the Kansai area towards the end of your trip you may be lucky enough to be in Kyoto when the fiery Autumn colours are so wonderful. Perhaps proposing in one of the beautiful temple gardens such as at Ninnaji?"
JapanTravel,3cjb6z,Gurtang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:46:02 2015 UTC,Oh wow Ninnaji looks really beautiful!
JapanTravel,3cjb6z,Gurtang,2,Wed Jul 8 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I am not sure where the best places to propose would be but if you are looking for a romantic night, I would check out kamo river and wander down the alleyways that are parallel with the river. Spend a night wandering. Kyoto is a gorgeous city and my favourite from our Japan trip.   EDIT : Also, before I forget of course, good luck mate. Have a great time in Japan."

JapanTravel,3cila8,Usakiia,4,Wed Jul 8 04:51:16 2015 UTC,"How big is the group? I honestly wouldn't go with a bigger group than 4. Getting spots in hotels, restaurants, bars, taxis etc... can be a problem and time consuming with a large group. Then you all have to agree on what you want to do, how much you want to spend on dinner, and you all have to wake up and be packed and ready to go at the same time. You might just find one friend that has a similar budget and can commit with you and the two of you start setting dates, buying tickets, and booking reservations. You'll quickly see who else is committed and who isn't. If you're determined to go with a really large group you might look into a tour group where payments are made upfront and everything is scheduled for you. This way no one in your group of friends ends up being the travel nazi (which, honestly sounds like it will be you and will suck for you). Good luck."
JapanTravel,3cila8,xinganbaobei,2,Wed Jul 8 06:42:48 2015 UTC,"Never pooled funds. I wouldnt recommend going as a large group or at least plan to split up. Some people travel faster than others and have different interests. When I went with my group of 6, we ended up splitting into three groups at the end (stayed at the same hotel still and did major attractions together. Shopping or just browsing was your own time)"
JapanTravel,3cila8,DISKFIGHTER2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:17:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat. I usually plan trips for myself and my wife, we're going with a friend next year and are working out the logistics now.  So far what we've come up with is this:   Plan overall trip, estimate budget. Every 3-4 months or so, check on budget Various Deadlines (apply for passport by x, must give me airplane ticket money on y, etc)   If you can't meet the deadlines for up-front payment, then you can't go, that simple. Things have to be booked/reserved in advance.  On a related note, does anyone know a good app or website that's easy to coordinate planning things like this? So far we've just been using shared docs in Google Drive, but I feel it's lacking the collaboration part a bit."
JapanTravel,3cila8,reol7x,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"We are going next spring and I'm main planner of the group of five. In order to prepare for this trip, I did research regarding accommodations, flights, bugeting and etc. I'm also the one who put money down for accommodations and most recently, the plane tickets (it was so cheap!). We agreed to pay me back on monthly basis.  I created a spreadsheet which has our planned agenda, budget, places to visit, deadlines and how much people owe me.   I find that it really helps to sit down and have a ""meeting"" so we are all on the same page. When I booked the accommodations and the flights, everyone got on Skype to discuss."
JapanTravel,3cidi0,rainbowbrite07,3,Wed Jul 8 03:35:20 2015 UTC,I believe that it is okay! Some other people I know bring their own and there are many stories of foreigners who don't fit the typical Japanese size who bring their own as well.  As long as they don't scuff up the floors it shouldn't be a problem.
JapanTravel,3cidi0,Kitakaze_Punch,2,Wed Jul 8 04:57:35 2015 UTC,"It's not really OK. The point of slippers is keep things clean and carrying your own around implies that you don't think you will be provided for properly.   It's also definitely not OK to carry around your own bathroom slippers. Once they touch the bathroom floor they are ""unclean"" and keeping them in you bag would make it and you unclean."
JapanTravel,3cidi0,its_real_I_swear,3,Wed Jul 8 08:03:34 2015 UTC,Really? I wear a U.S. men's 13. I should just leave my slippers at home and stuff them in to the biggest available?
JapanTravel,3cidi0,japanqs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:48:30 2015 UTC,The bathroom rule is much more important.   The whole point of slippers is basically magical cleanliness. So it is most important at temples which is exactly where you probably want to wear them. You're supposed to use the ones they provide and maintain
JapanTravel,3cidi0,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking on the OP, I wear AFOs. I think that if I wear socks over them (as well as under them), I should be OK on tatami floors (it shouldn't be any different from my wearing socks over my feet normally).   Slippers on hard floors might get weird, though. What's the maximum size they go to? I wear a women's 9-9.5 normally, but I have to wear an 11 because of these things.   FWIW, I won't be staying at anyone's house. I only expect to run into this with temples and a maiko event that I believe is on tatami mats."
JapanTravel,3cidi0,macphile,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:49 2015 UTC,If it's soft it shouldn't be a big deal. Tatami can be physically damaged by shoes so they're pretty strict about that.   As far as templesa woman's 11 is 26cm so that's well within average foot size
JapanTravel,3cidi0,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't think other slippers are clean, it's that I have wide and flat feet and wear a women's US size ten. Strictly a size issue. Also I wouldn't use them in the bathroom.   And yes here at home I do take house slippers with me when I go to certain friends' houses, especially with split-level homes where you enter the home at a 6'x6' landing and immediately go either up or down stairs. I don't like going up and down wood stairs in socks - they're slippery - and many of them have guests leave their shoes at the door."
JapanTravel,3cidi0,its_real_I_swear,0,Thu Jul 9 03:35:46 2015 UTC,A women's size ten is within average foot size for men so slippers should be fine.   The etiquette in America regarding slippers has nothing to do with the etiquette in Japan regarding slippers.
JapanTravel,3cidi0,SoKratez,0,Thu Jul 9 07:41:59 2015 UTC,"No. Don't bother. Anyplace you go where slippers are expected, they will be provided. Do you think Japanese people carry around slippers with them?"

JapanTravel,3chyhp,devinecreative,3,Wed Jul 8 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"For example, is it reasonable to book accommodation say, 2-3 days before I arrive each location? I'm familiar with most accommodations having quite flexible cancellations prior a few days of arrival, which is great. But do you guys see any potentials that could leave me short? In my mind, what If I really, really enjoy Kyoto and wish to spend more time there, but I have to fulfill an already booked accommodation in Hiroshima or Osaka. Or I come across a nice Ryokan on my way back from a destination and in spirit of the moment decide to stay there? This is my first time in Japan and I don't necessarily have a good idea about where to stay or what I might enjoy/experience the most first time round. So I feel my approach could either be successful or terribly misguided.   It could be both. Terribly successful and horribly misguided. The only thing I can say for sure, having been in Japan at this time two years ago and trying to find accomodations in Naha Okinawa before a typhoon hit, is that I ended up paying double what I normally would for a room because they had no dorms left and I had to stay in a double room... or sleep at the airport. Then a few days prior, I encountered a group of backpackers at the front desk of my hostel in Kyoto begging for a room to sleep in, but the hostel was completely booked solid. You run the risk if you don't book in advance somewhat, or at least are very sure of what your alternatives are in case you can't. If you're really, truly not caring about where you stay, you should be fine to do whatever but that's up to and including sleeping in a park at night if you can't find a hostel/accomodations, or paying up to $300.00 a night to stay in a high-end hotel because everything else is booked.  I hope you have enough money to cover any kind of possiblity if it comes to that.  Other than that, you can indeed do just about anything you please, but I agree with the other posters on Ryokan. I don't think very many of them take walk-ins, for lack of a better description. If it was something you really wanted to cross off your list, take a look now and you might find one that suits you in Kyoto."
JapanTravel,3chyhp,amyranthlovely,2,Wed Jul 8 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's possible to extend your stay at your current location as long as they have available beds. If not, there shouldn't be any issues with finding a bed in Tokyo or Kyoto, what with hostelworld or airbnb.  As for the other booked accommodation, you should call the hotel/hostel and try to rearrange the dates. Chances are, they would still charge your first night as that's what most places do.   For a Ryokan, I'm very doubtful they would accept you without reservation. But I might be wrong, and it wouldn't hurt to try.  You might know this already but you can use the JR Pass for local trains too, as long as they fall under JR. You'll use it a lot more in Tokyo than Kyoto though.  Wandering around Tokyo without a fixed itinerary is my favourite way to enjoy the city (if you have the time). As you have said, get a general sense of direction that you want to be in and just start walking. There are maps planted around, with directions in english/romaji so you wouldn't get too lost."
JapanTravel,3chyhp,EjectaFizzy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"I booked all of my accommodation the night before i arrived, i never just turned up without a booking but you definitely could have as there was plenty of room.  If you book via hostel world then ignoring a booking only costs you $2-3 so it's not a big deal."
JapanTravel,3chyhp,dbxp,2,Wed Jul 8 09:56:21 2015 UTC,"I think you should be ok, suggestions of booking a night in advance are great, there's plenty of websites online to book hotels/hostels. AirbnB is also another option.  I'd do some checks to make sure there's no festivals in/around where you plan to be and risk losing a place to sleep.  On the other side of the coin, I had a list of ""must-do"" things in each place we went. We pre-booked rooms for our two week trip. My big concern was we would get distracted in a certain place, and not want to make it to our next destination and miss out on something we REALLY wanted to do.  That said, I really wish I had another day or two in Kyoto and a bit less in Tokyo :("
JapanTravel,3chyhp,reol7x,2,Wed Jul 8 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"I booked hostels on the same day usually, it only really blew up on me once, a Saturday in Kyoto.  What I could have had if I had booked early: a dorm bed for 2500 yen.  What I actually got: arrived at the train station with nowhere to go so I stored my luggage in a coin locker (500 yen per day plus 500 for overnight), but I kept a change of clothes and my toiletries in my day pack which I then had to carry around everywhere. At 10 pm I looked for a manga cafe, but the one I found online was permanently closed. After some more frantic searching online I found another one. I went in, saw the booth and the reclining chair and bailed. Walked around, tried to find a hotel, failed. Went back to the cafe, this time they handed me an English menu and I realised there's a booth big enough to lie down in for 3600 yen for ten hours. I booked it and, well, it was an experience. No proper bedding but the floor was padded and they did provide a blanket. I had a computer in my booth and free hot drinks. It was a little noisier than a dorm room (both late at night and early in the morning) and I hadn't brought my ear plugs.  In the morning I had to force myself up because of that 10 hour limit. I tried to shower (free) but there's only one shower between about 20 people and it is booked in 40 minute slots. I could either wait two hours or give up and stink up Kyoto a little. So I left.  So yes, it was an experience, but an expensive one considering that it had no other upsides whatsoever, except for giving me a reason to taste test 20 Japanese soft drinks. Ultimately I wish I'd booked in advance.  If this has intrigued you, an hour at the manga cafe only costs 440 yen in the day time.  tldr in a tourist hot spot or a city? On a weekend? Book that shit.  PS booking.com allows reservations without deposits."

JapanTravel,3cgoql,mybigleftnut,3,Tue Jul 7 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"Most of your days are very busy already. I assume you like a fast pace. If you must fit in Osaka then I would do Fushimi Inari early on one of your Kyoto mornings, probably the 26th. Then go to Nara early on the 27th, and go to Osaka in the afternoon/evening. If you only see Todaiji and the deer then you don't need a huge amount of time in Nara. On the 28th do Himeji Castle early in the morning (arrive as soon as the castle is open) and if you need to see more of Osaka go to Osaka after Himeji Castle.    Do you already have your Ghibli Museum tickets? If not then I would order them as soon as possible, either via JTB or using a buying service in Japan like bridge.jpn. Do not wait until you are in Japan to purchase these as they will more than likely be sold out. Aug 30 is a Sunday so that makes it even harder to get tickets. Might be better to swap your Ghibli visit to one of your other Tokyo days. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3041.html#section_admission    I assume you will have a 7-day JR Pass? I would set activation date as Aug 23 or maybe Aug 24 when you exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass. If you arrive and depart from Narita then I'd probably get the NEX Round Trip Ticket:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_nex.html"

Is it possible to maybe do everything in Hakone and then go to the onsen there for a bit and then back to Tokyo or would it be better to spend the night there at a ryokan?   Or would it be better to stay at a ryokan somewhere else like maybe Takayama and skip Hakone?
JapanTravel,3cgoql,jaqueass,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would consider cutting a few things; I would guess you could do half your planned activities and still stay quite busy.  Hakone is fine, I was there last week. If you want to go up into the mountains more though you may have trouble.  Also, randomly, you should look into Koyasan. It is close to Osaka and much more interesting than a lot of the places you're looking at."
JapanTravel,3cgoql,jaqueass,2,Wed Jul 8 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"I would drop sky tree (it's a sprawling tourist trap and isn't as good as the metro govt building anyhow) and Asakusa (interesting if staying in Tokyo, boring if you're hitting other major temples in less urban areas). If you're doing Tsukiji you have to be there very early to see the auction or many of the good sushi places anyhow. Just do that and hit Hakone after."
JapanTravel,3cgoql,adam_364,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:16 2015 UTC,I wasn't planning on going to see the auction just going to the market and looking around and then eating some breakfast there.
JapanTravel,3cgoql,adam_364,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"Right - so depending on where you want to go will affect when you need to show up.   The classic tourist place is Sushi Dai; if you want to go here I would recommend you show up around 3-4am (I believe they open at 5). If you show up later you may have to wait in line for 6+ hours or not get in at all (they close at 2p, I think). Hard to say if it's ""worth it""; it is very good, but probably not worth such crazy wait times. Still worth going to at least once. I went at 3:45am and got in around 7am. This is less crazy than it sounds as you'll probably be jetlagged and up at that time anyhow.  As alternatives I would recommend Daiwa Sushi and Ryu Sushi. Both are great alternatives with far more reasonable wait times (maybe 1-2 hours for Daiwa, no wait for Ryu when we went). There's another place between Daiwa and Sushi Dai that is supposed to be good as well (can't remember the name, I want to say Yamazaki?) and usually has little wait.  If you don't mind a bit lower quality you can always go to the sushi places just outside of the market. They're fine - great by foreign standards - but the fish wasn't as good by my experience. Good luck!"

I'd definitely visit Fushimi Inari and Kinkakuji and yeah maybe Ryoanji since it's close to Kinkakuji.   Also, I'd recommend making Hakone a stop on the way from Tokyo to Kyoto, otherwise you'd have to ride west, east and then westwards again."

JapanTravel,3chutk,PlatinumMinatour,2,Wed Jul 8 02:38:18 2015 UTC,"There's more options in Japanese, so you might want to ask your friend to help search. On Jalan, 10 places come up for ryokan with private baths available (the Japanese site comes up with 18 ryokan in a similar search). Japaican doesn't have a private bath search, so you'll have to check each individually. It does have an ensuite bath search, but unless money is no object, they may be a little too expensive."

JapanTravel,3chutk,AisurDragon,2,Wed Jul 8 23:42:44 2015 UTC,Considering Kobe is is the HQ of the largest Yakuza I'm sure you could find an Onsen which will accept people with tatoos
JapanTravel,3chutk,khoins,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:59:00 2015 UTC,I've heard that people have gotten away with using bandages to cover small tattoos to get in to onsens. It lets the Japanese pretend they don't know you have a tattoo.
JapanTravel,3chutk,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:27:52 2015 UTC,In my experience if someone spots them then they'll most likely ask you to leave (I've been asked to leave Spaworld before because of a small back tattoo I have). Next visit I just hid it behind a towel on my way in.  Yours sound pretty small and easy to cover up - just hide it from onsen staff with the provided towel and you shouldn't have any problems. Worst case they will very politely ask you to leave.
JapanTravel,3chutk,its_real_I_swear,2,Wed Jul 8 04:31:16 2015 UTC,The one on my wrist will be easy to hide.  It's the one on my chest which concerns me.    Throwing a bandage over it should do the trick though.  I just don't want to go through the embarrassment of getting asked to leave.
JapanTravel,3chutk,its_real_I_swear,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:27:51 2015 UTC,I don't know why people want to give people who don't want their business money so badly
JapanTravel,3cfai8,Semigruntled,3,Tue Jul 7 13:40:44 2015 UTC,tbh I think meals are a big part of the traditional ryokan experience so I would book half-board.   Also 150 per person or the night?
JapanTravel,3cfai8,RealArc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:03:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I am sort of on the fence about meals. On the one hand I'd kind of like to be able to get out into the city and try some various restaurants and such and that way we don't have to plan and make sure we are back at the ryokan by 7pm or whenever dinner is. On the other hand I hear you about that being part of the experience. Sort of why I was thinking may half-board with just breakfast would be good.  Ideally $150/night but again I'm not sure if that's realistic?
JapanTravel,3cfai8,RealArc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"http://www.insidekyoto.com/uemura-southern-higashiyama  I saw this but dunno about availibility. They only serve breakfast.   TBH when I go to a ryokan and don't wanna pay for two meals I often skip breakfast and book dinner instead. I like Japanese style breakfast (I also like natto) but it's not for everyone and imo a bit less spectular than dinner.  Also do you wanna stay the whole 5 nights? I get not wanting to move hotels but ryokan stays are enjoyable like 2 nights max (imo, because most people go to relax, bathe, eat dinner, sleep, repeat) after that I would want a cheap room with a private bath and the freedom of choosing my own meals.  That said, 150 per night will not make it easy."

JapanTravel,3cfai8,hi5yourface,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that important to specifically stay at a ryokan if you're neither interested in an onsen nor dinner. If you want a traditional ryokan experiance, how about 1 night outside of Kyoto with dinner included?"
JapanTravel,3cfai8,Gurtang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at gion apartment in kyoto.  More like an air bnb than a ryokan, but it's great for how cheap it is, about 100 night.  They've got a website."
JapanTravel,3cgjf2,Dave_the_lighting_gu,3,Tue Jul 7 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would say in general, AirBnB is trustworthy.  I stayed with three different AirBnB hosts in my Japan trip last year. Two in Tokyo, one in Kyoto. All three hosts were awesome, great communication, I had quite a few questions beforehand, and they were usually pretty quick to respond (especially given the time-zone difference).  Each of my rooms were quite clean, and for better or worse exactly as described.  Two of the hosts I plan on using again if I go back to Japan, the 3rd I'll not bother with. The issue wasn't the hosts, but the room itself, it was located right next to the JR Chuo line, as in, several feet out the window was the pillars of the line.  I vastly underestimated how much noise that would make.  In their defense, the listing did mention is was very close to the tracks and the trains make quite a bit of noise. I was just thinking ""eh, how bad can it be.""  Look for anyone with a lot of positive reviews or a Super host, I think it's called, some sort of badge they give certain hosts.  Ask them an innocuous question, maybe a little more specifics on the location, some sort of nearby attraction you plan on going to, see what kind of response you get.  If you're satisfied with the listing, and their response, you'll probably be ok."

JapanTravel,3cgjf2,reol7x,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"Having a kitchen was great, although we didn't use it as often as we thought we did.  The biggest plus for me was being able to do laundry easily at our convenience."
JapanTravel,3cgjf2,DateATouhou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Be careful with the pictures though. My girlfriend did an AirBnB that had pictures of a pretty large room with a bed. Description didn't say anything about the bed or room or anything, but the title did say ""BIG ROOM"" and the pictures did look promising. However, once she got there, her room ended up being a small room with a futon. The big room was already occupied. She already paid so she can't really refund, and it would be a big hassle to find another long stay in the area.   So yeah, if you go AirBnB, ask for more details about the room."
JapanTravel,3cgjf2,HARADAWINS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:24:28 2015 UTC,"In general almost everyone I've encountered in Japan (I've been to Japan a lot, have family there, etc.) is really honest. I would opt for an airbnb simply for the fact that everything is so expensive in Japan and because it's such an easier time. Hotels can also be super tiny. At the same time, Japanese service is next level so if you're traveling outside of Tokyo, a hotel might really be better given that you might want some help getting around."

JapanTravel,3cfybm,Aerim,2,Tue Jul 7 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"No, only one single Shinkansen ride won't pay off. Himeji and Nara can be reached via JR though (doesn't make the JR pass worthwhile though). JR is basically worthless for Kyoto though.   Buy a regular ticket for Nozomi Shinkansen and enjoy."
JapanTravel,3cfybm,RealArc,2,Tue Jul 7 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"Having been there myself in the past month, I would highly recommend Himeji Castle. It's a beautiful, pure white castle that stands proud and tall in the sunlight and is in almost original condition (save for some restoration works over the centuries) as it has never been damaged by fire, earthquakes or wars. Not even the Allied bombardments during WWII scarred the castle, as they had thrown camouflage netting over it."
JapanTravel,3cfybm,SJ_RED,2,Tue Jul 7 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"You mention ""only a single Shinkansen ride"" so do you fly into Osaka and out of Tokyo? Or are you doing a round trip from Tokyo to Kyoto and back to Tokyo again? ie. Do you mean two Shinkansen rides?    If round trip from Tokyo I would get a 7-day JR Pass. It covers Tokyo to Kyoto, Kyoto to Himeji and to Nara. You could also use it for the five other days you are in Tokyo on the JR Lines, or for another day trip from Tokyo to somewhere like Nikko or Kamakura.    If you must see Himeji and Nara then you can consider arriving at Himeji Castle when it opens, then go straight to Nara. Probably possible if you like a fast pace and only really want to see Todaiji and the deer.    If you don't end up using a 7-day JR Pass then the JR Kansai Area One Day Pass (2200 yen) is worthwhile if you go to (just) Himeji. It would also let you go to Himeji and Nara if you squeeze those two into the one day:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_03.html"
JapanTravel,3cfybm,david_131,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry, I meant one round-trip Shinkansen ride, since we are flying into and out of Tokyo."
JapanTravel,3cfybm,Gurtang,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"As already pointed out, the JR pass depends on what you mean by ""single shinkanse ride"".   If it's a return trip Tokyo-Kyoto-Tokyo, with Himeji the 7 day pass will pay out. If it's really only Kyoto-Tokyo, then no (even with Himeji).  But doing Himeji, Nara and Kyoto in 2 days, honestly I don't advise it. It's doable (everything is doable), but very rushed. You'd have to wake up really early on both days and spend half a day in Himeji/Nara before touring Kyoto the two afternoons. Or the other way around but I think it would be better to be on the train early in the morning before Nara and Himeji open. Better time management.  Himeji can be a pretty fast tour (you go there, see the gardens, go up and down the castle), but with the train rides you need to plan for half a day.  Same for Nara but even longer because it would be a waste to go there just to see the big buddha and get back, for instance.   If you absolutely want to do it, I'd say go to Nara first, early, see what you want, depending of whether you enjoy the place or not you can do the ""get there, get back"" thing or stay a little longer and then enjoy Kyoto in the evening (most temples are closed after 4 PM). You can check out Fushimi Inari on the way there, or back.  Second day do Himeji in the morning and then Kyoto in the afternoon : maybe 2 temples (like Kinkakuji and Kiyomizu-dera, or just stick to the east side and go from the Ginkakuji to Kiyomizu-dera)."

JapanTravel,3cduul,Tw1987,5,Sat Jul 18 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Japanese people tend to love it when you use ""shoganai"" correctly.

When I tried to pick up a bartender, and he told me he had a girlfriend, I said ""shoganai"" and he thought it was so funny, he gave me a free drink.  Another great one is to say ""gochiso samadeshita"" after a meal. This is thanking the chef/restaurant for the meal.

It will bring you to the 5th station from where people usually start climbing the mountain. If you choose to do it at night to see the sunrise, I'd recommend renting a bed in a hut on the 8th or 9th station, to get some sleep before the last climbing stretch before sunset.   Make sure to bring pleeeenty of water and food (I had a pack of Matcha KitKat for the 5 hour climb and I was very hungry by the time I got to the hut to get some food). Bring warm clothing (jacket, wool hat, gloves, sweater etc.) as it's going to be freezing cold the further up you get. Oh and of course a headlamp if you climb at night.   I'd also recommend not making too many schedules the next day as you're most likely going to be really tired.  If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask."

JapanTravel,3ccyy9,Titibu,4,Mon Jul 6 23:56:15 2015 UTC,Backpackers hostel? http://www.backpackers-fuji.jp/  I've stayed here for 2 nights before. It was kinda a slow week so I had a double bunk bed to myself. It is quite near either Narita Stations (JR and Keisei). Looks like they're all booked though
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,sessyargc_jp,2,Tue Jul 7 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"A little more expensive, but in Tokyo, is the Guest House Shinagawa-Shuku. I've never stayed there but walk by it all the time, and it looks decent. It's right on Kita-Shinagawa shotengai."
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,PlatinumMinatour,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:31 2015 UTC,Yeah travelling to Tokyo will probably give the OP better options in getting a bed.
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,sessyargc_jp,3,Tue Jul 7 01:24:43 2015 UTC,Anshin Oyado Capsule Hotel is right by Shiniuku station and lets you leave your stuff in a free locker during the day if you're staying multiple days
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,RyanPhamcake,2,Tue Jul 7 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"I understand the idea and logic behind wanting to stay in capsule hotel until your partner comes but if you can find actual accommodations (even if slightly farther away) I personally would do that.   My travel buddy and I stayed in a capsule hotel and it sucked. These were were some of our issues:  -Obviously there wasn't much space in the facility to sit or hang out. -Locker room showers (I saw a lot of unintentional dicks) -as a tall person (not crazy tall just regular tall), the capsule was actually not long enough to sleep comfortably in -there are forced wake up & get out times. As a previous user mentioned, you have to leave the facility for a period of time every day. That's not fun if you've been out drinking the night before. -having just a thin screen between your pod & the rest of your floor, I heard everything including people walking around, snoring (super loud I might add), and what I thought was someone masterbating near by.  These were my issues w/ the capsule hotel we dealt with. I'm glad I did it, but one night was more than enough. If you don't mind possibly dealing w/ some of these things, by all means enjoy your stay. Those are my two cents (or my 2.45 yen the by the current USD/JPY rate)."

JapanTravel,3ccyy9,PlatinumMinatour,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge all capsule hotels require you to check out every day. So from around 10am until 4pm, you will have to store your luggage somewhere else. Do you really want to do that for four days?"
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,PlatinumMinatour,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:58:27 2015 UTC,All I'm taking is a backpack so thats not a big deal.
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,sessyargc_jp,3,Mon Jul 6 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"In that case, take a look at Cheapo Tokyo's recommended capsule hotels."
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,darey1,3,Tue Jul 7 01:19:21 2015 UTC,"That site mentioned Toyoko Inn.  It's a good budget hotel that have a Midnight Time Service. Operates ""capsule style"". You checkout for the day, then be back at the counter around 2300 to catch another Midnight Time Service. Rooms are definitely more spacious than a capsule! And free breakfast (rice balls, scrambled eggs, toast, coffee) in the morning! They should have some English speaking staff so no big issues in communication.  You can get the International Member's Card (pay extra 1500 yen though) :-)  (you use it as your room key, and a unique souvenir from JA)."
JapanTravel,3ccyy9,jaqueass,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"First Cabin in Akihabara might be an option, slightly more spacious that a capsule but still the same concept really. For what it's worth, I spent 3 nights in these hotels in a row (2 nights in 9 Hours Kyoto then 1 night at First Cabin)...I felt like a mess at the end. It's do-able and actually quite a fun experience, but it's unlikely you'll get the greatest nights sleep so four could be pushing it (unless you join in and get hammered like most the people staying there, in which case you might just join in the snoring chorus and sleep like a baby, but equally be worn down after four days)"

It is more temple and less hiking.  In southern Akita, Mount Chokai is accessible. A giant beautiful mountain overlooking the sea.  In Aomori, near Hirosaki, Mount Iwaki is a great day trip.  These are all accessible by bus or bus and taxi."

JapanTravel,3cbka3,Thunder_Cats,10,Mon Jul 6 17:09:06 2015 UTC,Do you need to dry wet clothes or reduce the humidity?  Because it's a dehumidifier with 'clothes drying' (hang clothes over it) option.
JapanTravel,3cbka3,ShawninOP,4,Mon Jul 6 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"Andother usage of it is humidifier (the second button from right). the Air conditioner in hotel is usually dry, this machine can help you to increase humidity level and prevent you from bleeding nose.  To use this function, you need to add water into its water tank, ususlly in front of it or by the side."

That's why you have the compressor sitting outside to blow air through it, or if you're in a building you have a chilled water loop.  On dehumidifiers, they use the intake on the unit to pull it across the coils (condensation collects on the coils, drips down) and at the same time it uses this cooler, less humid air, to then cool the compressor so it doesn't burn up.  You can quite literally heat a room with most dehumidifiers if they run a while."

JapanTravel,3cdrv3,consolewars,3,Tue Jul 7 03:07:25 2015 UTC,Probably shinkansen / bullet train.
JapanTravel,3cdrv3,JustVan,3,Tue Jul 7 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"Shinkansen. Don't buy a rail pass overseas before you go either. It won't get you on the fastest Shinkansen and generally not worth it unless you're travelling by train a LOT.  Also, the bento's on the Shinkansen platforms are coveted/sought-after, so buy one and enjoy it. No need to pack snacks as there will be a lady pushing a snack/drink cart down the aisles during your journey.  Lastly, if you're going all the way down to Kyoto, I'd highly recommend zipping over to Osaka since it's only 30mins away by train. Kyoto is beautiful and serene, but it's easy to overload on temples, whereas Osaka is a lot more lively and the food is out-of-control awesome.   Have a great trip!"
JapanTravel,3cdrv3,Rancid_Bear_Meat,2,Tue Jul 7 06:38:39 2015 UTC,Can you explain the diff between buying rail pass overseas vs not buying it? didn't read about this before i went.  Edit: also if you dont feel like going back to Tokyo - you can go to the KIX airports in the Kansai region for your return flight.
JapanTravel,3cdrv3,Tw1987,4,Tue Jul 7 11:48:34 2015 UTC,"Difference is cost. A pre-purchased rail pass allows you to travel by train freely without having to buy a ticket at the station, though you're restricted to certain lines in some cases. If you're plans involve a lot of rail travel, the pass can work out to be a lot less expensive.   If you're just going to make a couple/few trips, it's often less expensive/worth the freedom to just go to the station and buy tickets there. Particularly with the Shinkansen, the attendants are SUPER friendly, helpful and speak English.  Here's a little guide I give to first-time visitors.. maybe some of it will make your trip easier:  TAKE THE SHINKANSEN. Although it works out to about the same price when travelling down to Osaka/Kyoto, the JR Pass is not valid for the fastest type of the Shinkansen trains. You can buy a Shinkansen ticket in the Japan Rail office, located in the major stations. They have very nice, English fluent attendants who'll guide you through seat selection and any other needs you may have. Also, the JR Pass leads you to believe you can use it for the local subway and commuter trains -this is not always the case and can be a huge hassle. See below for EASY, local train solution to travel like a local.  When you land at the airport, go to one of the ticket kiosks and buy a 'Pasmo' or 'Suica' train pass card, and charge it with some cash. $30-$50 is a good start and there are attendants to help you with this at the major stations. This will allow you to just breeze through the station gates like a local with easy access to all of the local trains in the major cities. PASMO/SUICA cards are also accepted at most of the conbini stores and many vending machines -so it's effectively your own credit card while you're in town. Extremely handy!!  INTERNET  If you are taking more than one internet device (Phone, Tablet, etc), save yourself a lot of hassle and rent a MiFi from these guys: Global Advanced Communications -They'll deliver the device to your hotel or the airport post office. No hidden fees or funny business -just pure, reliable, connected internet access for up to 6 devices simultaneously. Having this and a tablet really gives you an edge with navigating (maps), booking hotels, staying in touch, finding fun stuff to do, etc. Cost is roughly $90 for 15 days of unlimited data. I just kept it in my pack all day with a spare battery and had a solid connection in every part of the major cities.  POWER If you are taking multiple devices, I recommend buying a spare, external battery as you'll be out most of the day and will find it difficult to recharge. The conbini sell a wide variety of small external battery packs, but getting a single, larger charger with multiple plugs WILL save you hassle. I recommend This one will reliably charge each of your devices multiple times each throughout the day if you're a heavy user. Don't forget to recharge overnight :)  ATM's  Getting money at the airport ATM's is the same as it is in the states; simple. Hotels will take your credit card but most other places may not. Japan is still a largely cash-based society so be prepared to be carrying tons more coins than you're used to. Even more reason to pickup the PASMO/Suica cards I mentioned earlier.  TOUR  If you're in Tokyo and want to see a bunch of the awesome tourist sights in one day without the hassle of walking in crowds -while also having fun, then consider doing the Great Tokyo Cycling Tour. Absolutely awesome human beings run this tour and it's so fun, easy-paced. Doable by anyone and you get to see more in one day than you would in a week by foot. Saturday tour is the best with Tokyo Bay ferry ride, Tokyo Tower, Old Temples, Festivals, Imperial Palace, Statue of Liberty, the best soba restaurant of your life, etc. And seeing Tokyo from a bike is an awesome experience!  GUIDE  If you don't already have it, there's a great guide to Uncharted Tokyo (and other areas) made by Redditors!  Etiquette  No talking on cell phones on the trains (which makes for a wonderful, serene environment). It's important not to obstruct flow of traffic in crowded areas (like subway stations) and you'll also be a tourist hero if you pay attention to which side of the escalator to stand on (you'll be on them a LOT). Tip: In Tokyo , stand to the left; In Osaka/Kyoto, stand to the right.  Good luck and have a great trip!"

JapanTravel,3ceaux,tlexa,3,Tue Jul 7 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"Replace the word restaurant with show in your mind.  When I went, I think perhaps 10% of the audience received food.

I tried it, it was absolutely terrible."
JapanTravel,3ceaux,reol7x,2,Tue Jul 7 12:15:20 2015 UTC,The food is... okay... But not worth the money at all. You are better off just getting a few beers into you and eating afterwards. I guarantee that you will have a lot to talk about at the table

If you wanted an area that's brightly lit, with lots of restaurants, and a great night time atmosphere, you definitely chose the right place. I stayed in Shinjuku my first time in Tokyo and had an absolute blast, went out and had a great time in Kabukicho every night, then stumbled back to the hostel.  Kabukicho area does have tons of sex industry shops and stuff, but it's also a totally normal nightlife area. The main thing is avoid the touts. There will be lots of dudes trying to get you to pay for sex or enter their bars or restaurants. Just don't follow any of those dudes and you should be ok. The only other thing you have to worry about is make sure you know how much a place is going to charge you. Sometimes they like to add sneaky fees, so just make sure you know what charges there will be beforehand. Entrance fees for bars are pretty common, fyi.   Just keep your wits about you, don't get too fucked up, and you'll be fine.  You're going to have an amazing time! n_n"

JapanTravel,3cb6z1,Black-Box,2,Tue Jul 7 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"Going near Godzilla are we.   Yes, no problem. Just ignore them (and actually you can show your discomfort if they try to tout you, what they are doing is illegal, they know it, and they would not want to cause too much trouble). The path from Shinjuku station to the hotel is wide and full of people anyway."

They get you in saying ""all you can drink for 2 hours, 4,000 yen"", then when you leave you'll have a bill of a 200,000 yen suddenly.  They'll physically stop you from leaving until you pay it.

BUT, it's still way safer than any party district in a big city elsewhere.  Just don't go in to the bars and it'll be okay.

It's definitely more expensive (expect to pay around $20/drink after everything is done) but is one of the best little bars in the world. Worth it if you have the money.  Ant n'Bee in Roppongi is good if you want to try Japanese beers. Also Good Beer Faucets in Shibuya. Brewdog has a place in Roppongi too that's good, though pretty westerner-heavy. They have a lot of Scottish staff.  Oh, and if you need a place to go in Hakone, I was just at Yuryo (http://www.hakoneyuryo.jp/english/) and it was a nice day trip. Right by the station.

It seems to get a bit of a bad rap in some guides as well for being not friendly to foreigners but that seems like a beat up as well, if the sign out the front is in English you'll likely have no trouble from what I can gather (provided there is actually room for you inside!). Can personally vouch for Aruku and Hair of the Dog, drank right through til closing time the next morning."

See the scramble crossing, be awed that you're in Japan, maybe do some shopping (especially if you're into music). Alternately it's doable whenever you do Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park (Sunday is a good day for this, weather permitting.)  If you are an anime fan looking for older goods, try Nakano Broadway on your way back from the Ghibli Museum. Ghibli is great but won't take a full day. This is also a good day to do your Shinjuku shopping but Shinjuku Gyoen is closed on Mondays.  DisneySea is a full day commitment so keep that in mind. As an alternative, you could visit Asakusa in the morning and take a water bus to Odaiba to visit the museums, arcade, and Palette Town there.  Understand that Akiba is fun for all but mostly geared to modern male fans. It is convenient to Asakusa. If your fiancée is into anime, consider a stop in Ikebukuro. Shibuya also has some good anime shopping."
JapanTravel,3cc9k5,pantherpg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:46:54 2015 UTC,If you like nightlife/shopping/food in the Osaka area i would recommend the dotonbori/shinsaibashi and surrounding area. If you want to include a small hike you can add Mt. Inari in Kyoto (Fushimi Inari Shrine).  We had a trip similar to yours and 7 day was fine. Can use the IC card in Tokyo and activate your JR Pass in the middle. The trick is you have to visit most of your sightseeing things within the 7 days to get the most out of it. For example - Kamakura/Hakone/Tokyo>Kyoto/Osaka/Nara and such. but you have alot of time to plan so see what works best for you  Instead of Flying out of Tokyo you can fly out of the Kansai region at KIX airport if you are travelling back just for the flight. Saves you 4 hours and possibly a half day of sightseeing.

What is your day by day itinerary, or at least what date do you leave Tokyo toward Kobe and what else do you see along the way and what date do you return to Tokyo? Have you booked flights? It might make sense to fly into Tokyo and out of Osaka or vice versa.    Rule of thumb is 7-day JR Pass = Tokyo - Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe - Tokyo. So as long as you have your away from Tokyo time within 7 calendar days then a 7-day JR Pass is useful although it won't save you much money.    If you are on a tighter budget then consider overnight buses."

You can lounge all you want at the field (it it's not raining). Sometimes they have people inside that will do your caricature.  EAT at the Ramen Street on the 10F (or maybe 11F) of the Isetann mall outside the station or at Nishiki. There is an udon museum around Gion area too.  WALK the SkyWalk after eating your full of ramen. or HIKE along the Kamogawa river. Further up the river there are stepping stones so you can cross to the other side.

Monkey Park in Arashiyama where you can feed the monkeys, get your photo taken with one of the big ones and generally feel intimidated by monkeys. I also recommend taking a walk through Sagano bamboo grove while you're so close.  Museums - there are plenty.  Regarding the manga museum I would only really visit if you're a fan of the artwork because there's very little to read if you're not fluent in Japanese. It's kind of like a mixture of a library and a museum with display cases detailing how manga evolved etc. There's a small foreign language section."

A secure private room to yourselves, with the extra floor space for your luggage. Standard capsule hotels only have a storeroom for your luggage. Some capsule hotels don't have individual showering facilities (public open baths).   Your hotel link points to Shizuoka, by the way...    Get your JR rail pass vouchers from JTB, then use that to exchange for the pass itself at a major JR train station in Japan (that's how the system works).  http://www.japantravel.com.au/List-Rail-Passes.asp    Cheap eats...  Well, as a fellow Melburnian with a huge eating capacity, eating out in Japan is often cheaper than back home.  Many of the business districts have restaurants that offer 1-coin (500 yen) lunch sets, but it will be peak hour and it's an eat-and-jet-off affair.  Family diner chains like Sukiya, Yayoiken (unlimited rice!) and other donburi stores are good value.

JapanTravel,3c9p3f,gisdaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:23:16 2015 UTC,"A return trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima with the shinkansen with reserved seats, will cost more than a 7-day JR rail pass (which has the benefit of being able to reserve seats at no extra cost).  In all 3 of my trips to Tokyo, I'll use a 7-day JR rail pass to hit the Kansai region (Kyoto and Osaka), and add a city or two as well.  I've done Hiroshima, Okayama and Kobe (one of those 3 cities per trip), plus day trips like Nara and Arashiyama.  Note that it's 7/14/21 days inclusive, so if you activate on Monday, you better return by Sunday.    Shizuoka is also accessible via shinkansen from Tokyo (1 hour), or local trains (3 hours)    Kagoshima is doable via shinkansen, but is really rough on the travelling time (7 hours from Tokyo, but 2.5 hours from Hiroshima).    If you're keen on loading up the schedule, you could milk the JR pass many times its worth.  Tokyo -> Shizuoka -> Osaka -> Kyoto -> Hiroshima -> Kagoshima -> LONG HAUL back to Tokyo.   Osaka is better from afternoon onwards, due to a lively nightlife. I'd base myself in Kyoto and do a morning walk, before heading for Osaka for the afternoon and rest back in Kyoto - because it's only a 30 minute train ride, but the packing up and relocating hostels eat up more time. Hiroshima is rather bland when the sun goes down."
JapanTravel,3c9p3f,gisdaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:52:09 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good idea, as my brother really needs to budget. Can you take suitcases on a shinkansen? I've been on one before, but we'd sent our luggage ahead to Osaka.  Ninja edit: After thinking, we might go straight from Shizuoka to Kyoto, then the rest, then from Kagoshima to Osaka, where we could stay for a bit before returning to Tokyo (since we're there for 3 weeks total). Also is it possible to include Nara/Miyajima in there?"
JapanTravel,3c9p3f,pantherpg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a small area behind the last row of seats of each carriage to slide your luggage in.    Miyajima will take up most of your day (especially, if you're aiming for low tide, or like being a wanderer), leaving it very difficult to make it back to Hiroshima and visit all the other attractions before closing time.  Hiroshima to Miyajima takes about an hour, train + ferry.  However, since the memorial park opens early in the morning (8:30am), you could rise up early in the morning, visit the park, then head straight to Miyajima for lunch before continuing the rest of the day.    Nara can be very time-efficient, if you're based in Osaka.  Do Nara during the day, then Osaka in the evening, and crash for the night.  However, if either of you are into anime and its merchandise, then Osaka is going to be a full day trip (Den Den Town in the morning, Dotonbori at night).  Basing from Kyoto is fine too, if you're doing a temple run day, visiting the Fushimi Inari shrine first, then continue your way to Nara."
JapanTravel,3c9p3f,Ivytiu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:48:09 2015 UTC,"You are going to have a blast!  For Tokyo accommodations, you might want to check out a backpacker's hotel. I personally have experience with the New Koyo and my husband has stayed at the Aizuya Inn. Having lockable private space big enough to stand in and for your luggage is nice, and these establishments are also well versed in helping foreign travelers.  How to get to your hotel from the airport will really depend on where you book, so let us know once you do that.  Dining at universities is inexpensive but not so much that you should go out of your way. Once you are settled at your hotel, you can grab bread and/or eggs from the nearest supermarket and you're set for breakfast for a few days. There are plenty of low price katsu, ramen, and soba shops around, and Yoshinoya still has a very reasonable beef bowl. On your way home at night you may be able to get marked down bento at your local super. Get only snacks or desserts at the theme cafés when possible because the food is generally mediocre and overpriced. If you're going somewhere fancy, try to go on lunch.  If you plan to do some museum hopping in Tokyo, pick up a Grutto pass at the ticket counter of the first place you go that offers it. After purchase, it offers free admission to a bunch of attractions like the Ueno Zoo, the Miraikan, and others.  I am having trouble looking up low cost carriers on my phone but I suspect you may be better off and have more fun flying to Kagoshima and using Willer buses and/or a Seishun 18 train ticket to work your way back up to Tokyo over the course of several days."

JapanTravel,3c7zyf,Tw1987,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:11:59 2015 UTC,Oedo Onsen is perfect for a day one. I speak from experience! Make sure you get there around noon-3pm tokyo time because around after 5 a big crowd comes. (This was on a tuesday)  They have feet only places and its outdoors in a secluded area. We did the fish eating dead skin thing - its a trip should try it if you want to try something different
JapanTravel,3c7zyf,JGJP,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"There's no point in going to Ooedo Onsen in Odaiba if you don't want to get naked and just want to soak your feet, it's deadly expensive and way out of the way for any normal sightseeing itinerary.  I remember hearing about a very old natural onsen maybe around the imperial palace that's free entry and only for feet but can't do the research right now.  If you're up for some Google translate though here's a list of places in Tokyo (feet only baths are referred to as 足湯 or ""ashiyu""):  http://www.go-spa.info/tokyo/tokyo.html  edit: I should specify that Ooedo Onsen is almost worth it if you make use of everything you pay for, as you can't pay for just the ashiyu section."

Unless you have a JR Pass or pay the extra fee, you will be getting a non-reserve ticket anyway. The longest I have ever had to wait to take a shinkansen due to fullness was one hour.      However, you are going during a major festival, things might be more full. But, I doubt you will have a problem getting a ticket day of anyway. A few days in advance should be no problem at all."

Nozomi is expensive, reserved seats (IIRC, 3 front cars and 3 back cars/carriages are non-reserved), take you there faster because it has fewer stops in between. Kodama is like the local train of the shinkansen. It stops at ALL shinkansen stations, it is all non-reserved seats. Hikari is the in-between. All have plush and more expensive seats in the ""green cars"". Seats in the green cars are always reserved.  Getting a ticket a few days before is OK if you are getting a reserved seat! If your buying non-reserved, do it on the day of your trip."

If you want to go to all the places you listed in Osaka then you won't have time for Himeji. To walk to the castle take a little time and you'll easily spend at least half a day there. That's the very least. Plus Himeji isn't really on the way to Osaka, you'd have to track back which means losing time again.

Didn't stay overnight tho.  About your itinerary, consider swapping Yoyogi Park to Sunday, as it's much more interesting then (rock&roll dancers, cosplayers, street musicians, artists, etc). You could do Hakone on Friday, Tsukiji, Asakusa, SkyTree, Odaiba. on Saturday, and Meji Shrine, Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, Shibuya on Sunday  Also, it's often possible to book an ""open-jaw""-ticket, where you leave from an airport different than the one you arrive at. So you could for example arrive at Narita and leave from Kansai which would save quite a bit of train travel between Kyoto and Tokyo. Which would then allow you more time to visit Osaka or Himeji."

It's easily accessible by bus but if you have a lot of luggage I advise getting a cab. The public buses were kinda small. My cab fare was 710yen so if you're with someone else, it isn't too bad."

It is a little more touristy now, and the service I got in 2010 was less personable and intimate as in 2000 but I would still go back if I had the chance.

But since you're going solo, I recommend you hostel it. It's cheap and clean and you'll meet some solo travellers along the way. Check out jhoppers.   Land at whichever is cheapest for you, it doesn't make a difference which way you do the circuit  Can't hand hold you on that one, you just have to dive in and research what tickles your fancy.   Familiarise yourself with Hyperdia and some basic Japanese phrases. A quick reddit search on it will help you. The Japanese are very generous and benevolent, you'll be okay!  Hostels bro.  JR passes if anything, generally break even. Again gotta do your research (ie cross check with Hyperdia) and see if its worth it for your case  The best fun is immersing yourself in the research/planning phase. Have a shot at putting together an itinerary and post it back here, and we'll be able to give you more personalised advice. All the best, bro!"

As a way far out there suggestion that I wanted to do but didn't get the change is to visit the rabbit island. Its along the train route to Hiroshima.

This will also give you time to go back to things you missed.  As Benkyoushiteimasu has stated. Get a 7 day pass and activate it in the middle of your trip. It might also be worth just using Kyoto as a base and then going to Nara and Osaka as day trips. You could also decide later to make a run to Hiroshima/Miyajima or Himeji while you're in Kyoto.

JapanTravel,3c7kel,david_131,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"Note that you can set the activation date when you exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass. ie. you can exchange when you land at Narita on the 20th, just make sure you specify the 27th as the activation date. Once you have the actual JR Pass you can also start making seat reservations, even if the pass is not ""active"", so you could reserve seats on an early morning Hikari Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto while you are still at Narita after you exchange. This will probably save you a lot of time on the morning of the 27th and allow you to see more of Kyoto on that day."
JapanTravel,3c7kel,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:47:19 2015 UTC,Might be worth seeing if you can change dates on your hotel. I did 7 days in Tokyo in May. 4 days on the front end and 3 on the back end. It made things much more relaxing since I was able to take my time at the end and revisit a few things. e.g. shop.
JapanTravel,3c7kel,uhoherk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:16:20 2015 UTC,Your trip looks similar to the one we had but we left days in Tokyo like the others mentioned so we can relax before leaving. To get from the airport to Tokyo we used N'EX but for out next trip might go for the bus since it cheaper.. maybe. When we picked up our JR pass at the airport we also purchased our Suica card at the same place which made it super easy. From there we used the Suica card whenever we were in Tokyo. We got the 7 day pass and activated it when we left from Hakone to Kyoto and used it the whole time till we got back to Tokyo from Osaka.

Please check with Hyperdia for as to which station you intend to depart from to get to Osaka, to see if you can make it.  3) Commuter trains: no. Shinkansen: Yes, for peak times - at the JR counter  4) Please refine your question.  5) If you're arriving in Kansai Airport, then going to Osaka is perfectly fine."
JapanTravel,3c6pf9,gisdaman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"in relation to (3). I'll be arriving at 5pm in Tokyo on the 23rd and wanting to go straight to Osaka, given this I can prebook online? for the trip from Kyoto back to Tokyo I should be right to prebook that when I arrive in Japan? The trip from Osaka to Kyoto I wouldn't need to book would I, from what I can tell it is just a short 30 min ride?  In relation to (4) Sorry I was asking how long I should allow between landing in Tokyo at 5pm and leaving on a bullet train to Osaka from Tokyo station  in relation to (5) we fly into narita so then we are going to travel by train to Osaka and work back to tokyo to fly out"
JapanTravel,3c6pf9,gisdaman,2,Sun Jul 5 11:59:14 2015 UTC,"Okay. This is the sort of trip I've done thrice before.  This is, land in Tokyo and then head to the Kansai area within a couple of days for a week, and then get back to Tokyo, during the Christmas period.    Ref #3: Easy question, are you considering a JR rail pass? Gives you unlimited travel on all JR train lines, including standard shinkansen services for 7 days. In any case, just turn up to a major JR station office and reserve/purchase your seat on the day.    Ref #4: It is extremely likely that you will catch the last shinkansen service to Osaka for the day.  1 hour should be enough to exit the plane, collect luggage, clear customs and head for the station.  It will take you 70-90 minutes for you to get to Shinagawa or Tokyo station.  You can reserve your shinkansen ticket at the JR office at the airport, but you have to be confident that you will make it to the train on time.  Tokyo station is very large and complex, and will take about 15 minutes to change platforms (it has subway, railway and shinkansen lines in different areas).  Catching the Narita Express train directly to Tokyo/Shinagawa stations is advised, however limited train services means you may have less time to play with, if you make mistakes or get lost.  There are other ways to get to Tokyo station, using more frequent local express trains, but they take longer and require a few platform changes - but may allow you the flexibility to leave earlier and allow more spare time to compensate for getting lost (not much more)."

Koyasan can be done in a day easily but again you're just constantly on the move.  You plan on walking from Kinkakuji to Ginkakuji? That's a pretty healthy walk. You're better off taking the bus since you'll need to get from Ginkakuji back to wherever you're staying.

You may wish to consider flying into Tokyo and out of Osaka (or vice versa) if you can, then you won't need a 7-day JR Pass and you usually save a bit of time.    There are no regular Sumo Tournaments in August but there are a couple of special one day events. Probably none near where you are but that depends a little on your exact dates and how much you wish to adjust your schedule:- http://www.sumo.or.jp/en/jungyo/schedule https://buysumotickets.com/sumo_event_calendar.html#special-events    Your list seems reasonable although it is a fast pace. I would try and catch the Shinkansen much earlier in the morning, ie. before 7am, so that you arrive in the next city around 9am, otherwise you ""waste"" too much sightseeing time if you don't arrive until noon. Use coin lockers at the stations or drop your luggage off at your next accommodation early if you have to.    Koyasan and a stay at a Shukubo will consume most of one day.     Try and schedule your Hakone stay mid-week and note that your options are reduced as a number won't accept solo travellers (or you may be able to pay for two people)."

I took a Japanese friend the first time (go over to japan-guide.com and go to penfriends and find one, you'll have lots of people who will help you -- you can offer to buy them lunch or something :).  The prescription information is the same, so there won't be any translation problems. They might send you to one of those machines where you look at the thing really far away, but that's it.  If you don't need any special glasses, it should take about 2-4 hours. If you want special ones (for example, PC glasses) it takes about five days unless there's a typhoon.   I went back by myself and got another pair (without my Japanese friend) and I managed to do it, combining their English and my bad Japanese.   It was a really good experience. The glasses were very affordable and I really like them. I got three pairs for the same price of one in my home country."

They called me it was ready after 4 days I think, and they turned out to be 5000 yen cheaper so they refunded me.  Can you speak Japanese?

I bought one from Telecom Square and it was easy as pie to set up on my iPhone 6.  You'll likely need to manually install an APN profile to make it work. Delete it after you leave Japan. It took me too long to figure out why my phone couldn't get on my cell data network when I got back stateside.   Also, look into renting a Pocket Wifi as another alternative."
JapanTravel,3c20dk,marktronic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"I used the b-mobile Visitor SIM which worked OK. You need to install an APN like marktronic said. It was slow (about 3 Mbps and high latency) but worked.  You also don't get any signal bars (because the SIMs don't have any voice support period) and there are compatability issues with some phones, but if your phone is recent it should be fine.  Better, though, really, is to rent a Pocket WiFi, which are much faster. They're just much much more expensive unless your trip is very short.  All the SIM providers and pocket wi-fi providers advertise throttling after some amount of usage, so don't go nuts with it."

Sure, the view is nice, but the bar itself is tucked far away into the hotel and takes quite awhile to get to. On top of that, they add a $20 cover charge per person.  My favorite bar experience in Tokyo was visiting Bar High Five. I came by right as it was opening for the evening and stayed for three hours. I had the time of my life talking to Ueno-san and the other patrons and the drinks were some of the best (if not the best) I've ever had in my life  Edit: Just realized you wanted something with a view.

JapanTravel,3bx9tf,GoufingAround,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"Hm. I know when it was still using Circles, the Amex Plat/Cent concierge line could get a reservation. It may be that the new company no longer can."
JapanTravel,3bx9tf,blue_apron_cooking,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"Fyi for those of you interested in getting reservations in Sukiyabashi Jiro (Ginza), it's nearly impossible to do so.  I tried getting one last year while I was in Japan for a month, and found out the procedure is as follows: * Reservations open up a month in advance and fill up in the first couple of days.  (i.e. Reservations for July open in June, and are filled by June 2nd or 3rd). * You must speak Japanese, as no one in the main restaurant speaks any English.  * You must provide a Japanese address and contact. * Lastly to confirm the reservation, you must drop off a deposit of 20,000yen (approximately $200) within a week of making your reservation.    Honestly, I know a lot of people are enamored with the thought of eating the ""best sushi in the world"" after watching the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi.  But his restaurant doesn't rank that high among locals.  It's not even in the top 10 of Tokyo, let alone Japan. http://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1301/A130101/13002260/#anchor-rd-detail"
JapanTravel,3bx9tf,xinganbaobei,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. You can make them through govoyagin.com (as mentioned already) with a deposit or through a high-end hotel concierge. My hotel booked it for me without a deposit with about 2-3 weeks notice, but they did explain that if we were a no-show we would be charged 50% of the meal. It leads me to believe he has special relationships with some hotels in Tokyo.  Now the other argument is if it is worth it. If you have the money to blow and have already tried lots of other sushi bars in Tokyo, or just have your heart set on it, go for it. If it is unlikely you will return to Tokyo again I agree it may not be the best choice for a lot of foreigners used to Americanized sushi. It is super traditional, and super fast. I think much of the nuance and restraint is lost on our palates."

I read your post and thank you for your information... I was wondering if there is a way to buy a reservation or something like that? I really would love to try Jiro with my girlfriend, as it's been close to 10 years since I have gone to Japan!  Thanks"
JapanTravel,3bx9tf,xinganbaobei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"Hi Unfortunately, this is par for the course now with Jiro Honten. If you're staying at one of the top hotels then you could try to get your concierge to keep pushing for a waitlisted place but in all honesty, you're probably out of luck on this occasion.  BUT... ok, look, I know that Jiro's now super famous in the west and all that, but to locals, his restaurant is not one of the top sushiya in Tokyo. It's very expensive, a rushed meal and no guarantee that Jiro himself will be there. I get that people want to eat at such a famous restaurant but with sooooo many other (better) sushi restaurants to choose from, personally, I'd rather save my money and have a more leisurely and enjoyable meal elsewhere!"

Your itinerary overall is ok if you like a slow pace, although perhaps a little long in Nara. Have you considered going to the Sumo in Nagoya? Tickets are pretty much sold out but you may be able to acquire some via queueing up early for the day release tickets, ie. before 6am.     If you plan on a day trip to Hiroshima/Miyajima then a 14-day Pass is a little closer to being reasonable."

JapanTravel,3bx82i,Jaimonster,2,Thu Jul 2 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"The JR pass will pay for itself quickly, especially if you use the Shinkansen a couple times. It's also less hassle to use it on commuter trains too.  I went in November a few years ago to see some of the geeky things but a lot of the more traditional and nature-y things, especially food. Most of the places you are looking at seeing I didn't go to.   My advice:   Buy your JR pass online from JTB before you leave for Japan. You'll need to take the voucher you receive to one of the JR offices to exchange for the pass. (There's one at Narita if flying into Tokyo) Ghibli Museum is a great place to visit. Order tickets online in advance too. If you are planning to go to Kyoto and unable to get a place to stay there, try in Osaka and use the Limited Express trains to get to Kyoto (half hour) or stay in Nagoya (half hour by shinkansen to Kyoto) If trying to find the best way to get between different place try Hyperdia. It covers rail, bus, plane and ferry schedules. Just put in a starting station and destination and it'll give you options. It made my trip so much easier."

JapanTravel,3bx82i,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"I've done a similar itinerary before. For Tokyo, we stayed in Akihabara at the Remm Hotel, for about $100/night. The room is pretty darn compact, but the location is super ideal for exploring all the hobby shops around. And it is right next to the station.   Wherever you do decide on staying, a general rule of thumb is to grab their business card when you get there and put it in your wallet. That way, you can ask people if you get lost, or show it to a taxi driver to get back.   You listed all pretty fun places. For pokemon center, I like Osaka's a lot better than Tokyo's. It was bigger and cooler looking. Plan at least a full day or two for Disney Sea, because it is totally worth it.   There's also the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building in Shinjuku. They have a free observation level for you to see the skyline of Tokyo. The nightview is gorgeous.    How about Osaka castle? Are you into cool looking buildings? Check out Umeda in Osaka."

There's also tons of department stores at Ginza for you to browse or people watch. If you go on a weekend or holiday, the main streets of Ginza is closed off for cars, and all the pedestrians can walk in the middle of the roads. I really like visiting Tokyu Hands, which is like a department store, because it has fun stuff to browse.   You mentioned you're going to Disney right? Here's a site for you to see if it will be crowded or not: http://www15.plala.or.jp/gcap/disney/ This site shows estimated crowds based on school and holidays. It's only in Japanese though.

JapanTravel,3bx82i,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Okay hi there!  So I got back and I have a plan for you and some tips.  First off, when you go to the pokemon center just know that it's basically in an alley so it's real hard to find at first.  Second I suggest going to Sky Tree on top of going to Tokyo Tower since Tokyo Tower kind of has gotten outdated.  The gundam Cafe is a definite must.  Oh also if you find you want more to do go to Joypolis in Odaiba.  Odaiba has a ton of shit that all people would like, it's also where the Olympics will be held in Japan. There's tons of museums there you'd like to check out I bet.  Oh and the Ghibli Museum find a way to buy tickets in advance since you're going to need to, in order to go on what days you want.  Also I'll be going for 6 weeks starting in around a week and a half so if you somehow remember to message me or something I can tell you what I did.  I'm just visiting family but I go to a lot of places like those you've listed so you'd most likely enjoy them.  Also on top of that you should go to Jojoen if you ever get the chance. It's a restaurant that is kind of like a Korean table top barbecue except with the best damn meat you've ever had.  Basically go to any table top grill place and ask for ""carubi"" which is a part of the cow that is just fucking delicious.  I probably have more but I forgot a lot, if I think of more I'll try to remember to come back to post here.  OH ALSO.  There is this place called Higashi-Ikebukuro, and there's this shopping center called ""Sunshine City"" and it is amazing.  Inside there's so many nice stores and good places to eat and on top of that it has a theme park-ish place inside of it called ""Namja town"" and that place is fun as hell and also has good food inside. And also on the top floor they have a huge Aquarium that is beautiful.  If you go to the bottom level of the shopping center and go through a tunnel you can go to the Toyota center that basically acts as a museum and they have driving simulators and a lot of it is english friendly.  Then if you go farther through the tunnel there's a little ice cream place and then when you come out the other side there's this store called Tokyu Hands which is the best place to get souvenirs and gifts for friends since they have a lot of quirky items that are special to Japan."
JapanTravel,3bx82i,mybigleftnut,2,Sat Jul 4 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the pokemon center in Tokyo is really easy to find; you get off on Hamamatsucho stn (I believe that's the stn name?) and on the main street. But, from what I remember, the Osaka one is kind of hard to find, having to go thru an alley or something first."
JapanTravel,3bx82i,PitchforkEmporium,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:29:11 2015 UTC,"When I went to find it, it was off the main street in like an alley.  It's been a while since I went anyway"

Kyoto is a major historical place it would be cool to go there. Hokkaido is just for skiing etc? Any big differences between Hiroshima & Tokyo?"
JapanTravel,3buq0u,ukatama,5,Thu Jul 2 08:58:31 2015 UTC,Hiroshima doesn't ring a bell?
JapanTravel,3buq0u,Sciby,0,Thu Jul 2 09:42:07 2015 UTC,Well what do you mean the atomic bomb? The city looked rebuilt in google images. I dont know of any other differences between the cities
JapanTravel,3buq0u,Pugshaver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"The whole country is historial, it's just that Kyoto is more well known. Nara city has 16 blocks of shrines and temples in the middle of the city with the famous bowing deer."
JapanTravel,3buq0u,blp0121,2,Thu Jul 2 10:37:42 2015 UTC,"Kanazawa is a really nice place; a single two-hour train ride north from Kyoto. I spent 3 nights there, but I think a 4th would have been just right.  Better still, when you leave you take a short train trip east to Tateyama. From there, you can go over the Tatayama Kurobe Alpine Route. This was the best part of my trip. I strongly recommend you stay overnight at one of the hotels at the top at a place called Murodo. Beautiful spot up there (especially if it's been snowing) and Japan's highest onsen! Also, try to avoid doing it on a weekend since it gets pretty busy.  From the end of the route you can pretty easily then go to Matsumoto for the castle, and continue on your way to Tokyo."
JapanTravel,3buq0u,blp0121,2,Thu Jul 2 09:55:30 2015 UTC,"Kyoto is famous for foreigners;Kinkakuji,Fushimiinari,movie village, and so on! Which season are you going to come? If summer,you can see beautiful night view from Mt.Rokko,which is in Kobe."

JapanTravel,3buq0u,Sciby,2,Thu Jul 2 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"Oh,if you come in spring,you can see awesome cherry blossom,everywhere:) Kobe has a port that's is famous for its historical story;Tairanokiyomori,and you can see it with right up from mountain!

JapanTravel,3buq0u,Sciby,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"Split your time into two halves - Half for Tokyo and Hokkaido (it's not just for skiing, it's a pretty interesting place, with lots of history and corn/butter ramen). Go to Yamagata on a day trip, take the sleeper train up to Sapporo.   ...and half for Osaka. Use Osaka as a base, 30 min train ride to Nara city, Kyoto, Kobe, 90 minutes south to Koya-san, also Arashiyama in the north (considering how much time you've got, this is worth the day it'd take. Most people on shorter trips don't feel they can afford the 5-6 hour round trip it takes to get there).   Plus, Hiroshima with Miyajima and Bunny Island to the west of Osaka..."
JapanTravel,3buq0u,Titibu,2,Thu Jul 2 10:37:07 2015 UTC,"All cool and all, except for Hokkaido, which has many things but not ""lots of history"".  Probably the less historical area in Japan, unless you are into Ainu stuff.  Good food, nice scenery, but little history."
JapanTravel,3buq0u,Sciby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of ""historical"". Considering the Ainu are a long-standing and hugely important part of Japanese history, I'd say it's worthy.  Not all Japanese history is the 47 ronin and nice temples. ;)"
JapanTravel,3bugxm,mikgeo,3,Thu Jul 2 06:34:11 2015 UTC,I'd skip Osaka entirely - 2 nights in both Tokyo and Kyoto or even 1 night only in Kyoto depending on your interests.
JapanTravel,3bugxm,pomido,2,Thu Jul 2 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"I'd agree. As much as I enjoyed Osaka, with only 4 nights I'd do 2 each in Tokyo and Kyoto so you get the city/modern side of Japan and the temple/older side of it as well."

JapanTravel,3bugxm,Ghost772,3,Thu Jul 2 07:06:06 2015 UTC,"Like the previous post, there are certainly more things to see in both Tokyo and Kyoto. If your interests lies in shopping, Tokyo and Osaka offers quite alot of those. For temples, Tokyo and Kyoto are the place to be. It really depends on what you want to do during your trip there. Foodwise, all 3 places offer quite their fair share of food variety.  Even if you stay in Kyoto, the distance via train from Kyoto to Osaka is short enough that you can get to the airport easily."
JapanTravel,3bugxm,pomido,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:27:40 2015 UTC,"I guess so, since you'd be leaving from there anyway.

Kyoto really takes a good two to three days to see properly."

If you're willing to splurge a little I would definitely recommend staying in a ryokan, or Japanese style inn. Many will serve breakfast and dinner and some even have private baths for each room so you and your new spouse can enjoy it together. They are on the expensive side but even if for just a night or two I would say that its worth it to stay in one of these beautiful places for a great Japanese experience."
JapanTravel,3bva1p,HavokIris,2,Thu Jul 2 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"We're definitely planning on staying in a ryokan for a night or two. I'm not sure exactly what our trip is going to look like yet. I know we'll be in Tokyo for probably 4-5 days, and then I'm thinking about spending time in Osaka and doing some trips out from there.   I've been reading a lot about Koya-san lately and I'm thinking that might be a good place to do our ryokan stay."

JapanTravel,3btmqt,ItsKentK,3,Thu Jul 2 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"Basically, especially in Tokyo and Kyoto, have a guidebook and explore the must see places area by area.  In Kyoto don't miss these : Kinkakuji (golden pavillion) on the west side, Kiyomizu dera on the east side, Fushimi Inari in the south. That last one you can do on the way of a side-trip to Nara (there, check out Todai-ji with the big buddha, and the garden Isui-en, and there will be deers everywhere). Those are the good stuff for a first timer.   You can add the bamboo grove and monkey park in Arashiyama but it'll be short for a 2-day trip.  In Tokyo, honestly just follow itineraries, like those : http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3051.html You can really do them all (western full day, Asakusa/Odaiba full day, then add the imperial palace / Ginza half day). There will still be much to do so you can of course adapt.  If it were me, I'd remove one disney day and add one in Kyoto. By the way, it's going to be the school holidays so everything will be very, very crowded (Disneyland is always crowded anyways).  Oh, very important stuff : rent a pocket wifi. You can do that online and have it delivered to you at the airport. That way even if you fuck something up, get lost or anything, you are not helpless."
JapanTravel,3btmqt,Gurtang,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:31:45 2015 UTC,Hi! Can you tell me why that pocket wifi is cheaper than a sim card? I'm looking at Global Advanced Communications offers.

JapanTravel,3bsp4a,Bobbsen,3,Wed Jul 1 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Soccer journalist in Japan here.  Before I begin, you should be aware that both Diego Forlan and Cacau left Cerezo last month, in case your goal was to see either of them play.  The J2 League (second division), where Cerezo play, ends on November 23, with the Promotion Playoffs finishing on Dec 6. Any J.League teams not participating in the Emperor's Cup usually shut down between the end of the season and January 10 or so.  The following matches take place on your dates:  December 26, 2015: Emperor's Cup Quarterfinals  December 29, 2015: Emperor's Cup Semifinals  January 1, 2016: Emperor's Cup Final (Ajinomoto Stadium, Tokyo)  Cerezo could participate in any of these games, but if we're being honest I doubt they get that far.  Because the Emperor's Cup is a 'neutral' tournament, the QFs/SFs could be played anywhere - but one is usually played in the Kansai area and the other in the Kanto area.  The Emperor's Cup Final is a big New Year tradition, and if you can attend I definitely would. It's bitch-ass cold and the atmosphere depends entirely on the finalists but it's Japan's oldest competition and well worth attending for a neutral.  After that if you're really jonesing, the All-Japan High School Soccer Tournament kicks off around New Year's and the final is around January 10 or 12. It's a very big deal here and worth attending if you want to get in some grassroots. No details yet, though."

Order from another rental place?"
JapanTravel,3brnfk,apparition47,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:22 2015 UTC,They have counters at most major airports but they won't fulfill your order unless you pay by credit card beforehand. You could also replace the order a few days before your flight then pay then.
JapanTravel,3brnfk,reol7x,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"They mail the device to the airport/hotel/location you pick it up, so there's no ""booth"" you can pay at.  I'd email them back, if your trip is still a little ways out, I'd see if you can still pay it, or just reserve another device.  If all else fails, you can pick up one from a booth at the airport. The rates were a bit more than I was quoted from GAC when I went, probably 30% higher."

Yeah gimmicky, trying to be cute, nyan nyan tsyuuu :-)  FWIW the Imperial Palace is a black hole. Try to check it out on Google Maps. At the center of Tokyo, see the moat, green trees, and nothing. All you can see are the foundation of the Palace.  You'll be in Tokyo and Tsukiji is not in your itenerary? At least get a good breakfast there. The next time you visit, the Tsukiji might be in a different location.  Nearby Shibuya is Meiji Jingu, Harajuku (teens)/Omotesando (grown ups with tons of cash), Yoyogi koen. During weekends drop by the outdoor auditorium near the NHK buildings. They have festivals there.  From Kyoto, maybe a day trip to Nara or Osaka or even Koya-san. In Kyoto station, at the 11th Floor of the mall there is a Ramen Street. Different kinds of ramen from other parts of Japan. There is actually also another one in Tokyo Station, B1F.  Out in Kyoto (and even further west), JR SUICA/ICOCA cards are better bets on buses, and trains (except private lines of course)."
JapanTravel,3bs8ve,sessyargc_jp,2,Wed Jul 1 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"If you're in kyoto, go check out arashiyama. that place is great. They've also got a monkey park which if you're down for the hike/ climb, allows you a beautiful view of the city, while also seeing some monkeys. I woudn't recommend the maid cafe because to me it felt kind of gimmicky and seedy, but maybe that's just because of the one i went to. Try and get a JR pass if you can, it'll be easier to travel around the country that way. Try visiting an onsen if you're ready to be a big boy and understand the etiquette. Make sure you do your research first before committing a cultural faux pas when going to such places. I strongly suggest this unless you want to piss off an old japanese man by not knowing what you're getting yourself into. There are also tons of arcades, which if you're into, you can spend some time in. I'd also stop by nishiki market in kyoto, just to check it out, or up in tokyo, tsukiji fish market is cool too. It's pretty easy also to just google tokyo downtown or kyoto downtown and find lists of places to go. Have fun!"

JapanTravel,3bs8ve,PlatinumMinatour,6,Wed Jul 1 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of public bathing spaces/areas in Japan. Onsen is the more high-end one. The hot water is pumped directly from underground, and would contain various minerals, etc. The sento is the community public bath, it uses normal water that is heated.  Basically an onsen and sento is same inside. There is a counter where you pay the fees. You can buy towels here probably, and small tubes of soap/shampoo. The ladies and gentlemens areas are different. They'll probably point you to it. There is a dressing area where you remove all your clothes and put them in a locker. There is a bathroom nearby should you need to relieve yourself.  The next section is the bathing area. DO NOT go into the tub and soak! Please clean yourself first. Scrub yourself outside the tub, rinse, then soak. The tubs might have ""air jet"" massagers, or electricity (i love those), some tubs are lukewarm, some are plain water (i.e. cold). If there is a sauna inside, that is additional fee.  Only birthday suites allowed inside!  This website will cover the other subtle points: http://www.sentoguide.info/etiquette  There is a good onsen in Kyoto-area, up the mountains. Kurama Onsen, I haven't tried it but I've always heard good things about it.  Enjoy your sento/onsen experience.  Edit: ""Scrub yourself outside the tub, rinse, then soak."""

The issue with ""Take a shower outside ..."" is that when some people shower they don't soap up and scrub. (I see other Japanese do this at a sento.) This makes the water in the tub iffy ...

America and a few others can't.  You can drive for a year on an international permit with no test and no previous driving experience necessary, just need a valid license. But the instant that year is up suddenly it's illegal to drive without proving you know how.   Basically fresh off a plane? No driving experience in Japan? No problem you can drive.

JapanTravel,3bnxda,syn3rgyz,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Also, you should look into ""Highway Oasis""s.  https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9  (the link is in Japanese; just run it through a translation engine).  What this is, is basically a small tourist attraction that's connected to a highway rest stop. You can access it from both sides. Of course, getting there is still going to be a problem as it's meant to be accessed by car.  Maybe look for a local bus?"

JapanTravel,3bnxda,kaseijin64,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:47:18 2015 UTC,Highway busses often stop at expressway rest stops for very short rests.   Otherwise it's illegal for pedestrians to get on the expressway so you can't walk to a rest stop unless there is one somewhere with a pedestrian entrance open to the public.

JapanTravel,3bn1v9,Mametaro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:30:29 2015 UTC,Late september is when the weather starts cooling down. You might be able to see some gorgeous fall foliage during October.
JapanTravel,3bn1v9,Mametaro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:19:28 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of festivals in Japan for September and October. For some reason it doesn't include the famous Kishiwada Danjiri Festival (September 13th, 14th). There are many smaller festivals but as you can see from the list July and August are the big festival months.  As far as things to do, have you taken a look at tripadvisor? I think its lists are pretty accurate. Since you are spending a week in Osaka/Kansai area, besides Kyoto and Osaka, you might consider day trips to Nara or Kobe. You could take a trip to Koyasan or take longer trips to Himeji Castle or Miyajima near Hiroshima. Both of these places are very easy to reach by shinkansen/bullet train.  Whether or not you should buy a train pass (and which one) depends what you decide to do/see. You can check train fares to each destination by using Jorudan or Hyperdia. You could then check JR's (West Japan Railway) to see which pass is best for you: https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/travel-information/  Keep in mind that you may not always use JR trains as there are many other train lines in the area which are not covered by the pass.

I will say we spent 5 days in Kyoto and 5 in Tokyo with a couple day trips from each, we were pretty exhausted by the end.  Depending on how much you want to see/do in each place, you may want to add a couple of days there, but you'd have to drop others to do so.  We're expecting our first child, but have a trip planned to go back in 2017 and haven't decided whether to take ours or bring him at home. We're leaning towards leaving him home.  Good luck!"

Living costs shouldn't be astronomical. I find food here is generally cheaper than it is back home (Australia) and out of the bigger cities there should be some cheap supermarkets.   Should be pretty safe like most of Japan, just use common sense.  Aichi generally doesn't get a whole heap of snow in winter, but I think it did last year. Lowest temperature was -2.3 degrees celsius last year.   April would be a whole lot warmer, yeah, probably a nice time to come really.

As for your itinerary. If your intention is to maximize a 7 day JR pass then I think you've done a pretty good job. You could technically make a run for Hisoshima / Miyajima but you would have to drop Osaka or Nara.  Suica works in Kyoto and Osaka so you're good there, however, it's probably easier to buy an all day pass when you're in Kyoto. In Nara I just walked everywhere but again, an all day pass is like 500Yen"
JapanTravel,3bk0vc,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:04:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion. I'll keep Hiroshima as a backup for Nara or Osaka. 500 Yen seems reasonable for a day pass in Kyoto, I'll look it up."
JapanTravel,3bk0vc,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah Trains kind of suck in Kyoto unless you're going from Kyoto station to Arashiyama. As for the best pass, look up the raku pass which is specifically aimed at tourists."
JapanTravel,3bk0vc,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:15:12 2015 UTC,I looked up the Raku and it seems to be three routes targeting different tourist spots. I wonder if it may be an option to plan sightseeing routes around these bus routes?
JapanTravel,3bk0vc,dokool,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yes that's the one I used. Essentially the 3 lines will get you to all the major stops. The daily bus pass actually works for all buses. The Raku ones are just aimed specifically at tourists.  Google the Raku Bus Map in images and you'll see what I'm talking about. Essentially just pick your attractions along the way. It's obviously best used for day 2 on your trip. On your arrival day you could use your JR pass to get you to Arashiyama and Fushimi Inari. For day 3 you can do whatever you missed or make the run to Miyajima / Hiroshima.  I warn you now though, days 7/11-15 will be very tiring as Kyoto / Osaka / Nara will have a lot of walking. It's doable, but you'll just be moving at a faster pace as opposed to Tokyo. I did a similar route and just dropped things if I got tired."
JapanTravel,3bk0vc,dokool,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"There is a baseball game at Osaka Dome the day I'm planning to go there. Is this something I should try out?   You'll have a much better time if you go to the Hanshin Tigers game at Koshien instead, which shouldn't be that much further distance-wise. It's the Japanese equivalent of seeing the Red Sox play at Fenway.  My suggestion for the full experience: go early and find one of the shops outside the stadium that make custom uniforms, a Hanshin fan tradition.  You buy a blank jersey ($30) and then select your iron-on patches which can be decorations, lyrics to fight songs, logos, etc (those get very expensive) and then instruct the staffers as to where you want the patches placed - they do all the pressing while you wait.  Mine had to cost about $200 when all was said and done and even though I haven't been to a baseball game in years I treasure it. I would go as far as to say it's the coolest souvenir in sports.

I'm also not sure if using the JR Pass to visit Hokkaido is the best idea.

JapanTravel,3bk57c,david_131,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:49 2015 UTC,Rough date/month/time of year? Seems like a ridiculously fast pace to me. Way too fast for most people. As you have covered a bit of Japan before I assume you understand your desired pace but this still seems way too much to me. You also seem to be underestimating travel time to a lot of places but maybe you enjoy spending a huge amount of time (4+hours) each day on trains.    I'd probably start by writing in exact travel times for every single segment and then work out if you can actually do what you want to do in each place.    How long are you actually in Japan for? The other option rather than cramming in 21 days of a crazy pace is to maybe consider using some of the regional passes and spread out your travel time a bit more. The JR Kyushu Passes are often good value for example and you can have a bit more time at either end perhaps. There are a number of LCCs like Peach or Jetstar Japan which can get you to/from different parts of Kyushu.    You also don't need a JR Pass on Yakushima for example so that gives you a bit more time also. Maybe something like 14-day JR Pass and a JR Kyushu Pass will actually give you more time for exploring.

You can buy an onsen pass that lets you experience all the onsens.  But yeah what i mean by no problems with tattoos is I checked with the tourist information office there about it and was given the green light.

JapanTravel,3bk23z,thehahal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"re: Kyushu;  Went to Kurokawa Onsen last October with my wife. We stayed at Sanga Ryokan. My wife has two small tattoos near her shoulder blades. About the size of a credit card for reference.  Sanga had several private baths, all could be reserved at no charge for staying guests. We used those quite a bit. While there were very few people there, in the public bath, either nobody noticed or cared. It seemed most the guests with us were foreign as well.  The village has a lot of onsen/ryokan, I can't speak for the other onsen there, only for what we experienced at Sanga.  I think their official policy is ""no tattoos"" so YMMV.  The entire town seemed to handle foreign guests frequently, the visitors center took luggage for us, quite a few people spoke English."
JapanTravel,3bjwxj,mdz92,3,Mon Jun 29 20:46:34 2015 UTC,"Nothing, really. Shoulders and cleavage, kind of, but you'd get a free pass as a tourist. And wear appropriately in nice restaurants. Other than that, as long as you don't have ""kill the japs"" emblazoned on your T-shirt, you should be good."
JapanTravel,3bjwxj,ukatama,0,Mon Jun 29 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Japanese don't show shoulders and cleavage. It's considered pretty indecent. Shorts are considered clothing that little kids wear, but again, they'll accept you as a tourist. Girls usually wear shorts or skirts/dresses with leggings, because showing too much leg is also considered indecent. Flip flops are kind of frowned upon as well. Try not to walk and eat/drink, although I'm totally guilty of that.   Pack an umbrella if forecast says rain, or buy one there (they've got really pretty ones). You can also use it as a sunbrella."

Off the shoulder stuff is really popular right now in Japan, so showing shoulder will not offend anyone bet the eldest of grannies.  Now, spaghetti straps with deep cleavage are uncommon, so if your sister is of ample bosom and she's afraid of getting leered at, she might want to back off of those.  As for you, guys used to not wear shorts much because they pretty much grow up wearing dark navy or black pants all year since they wear uniforms.  BUT more and more young guys wear shorts now, so no one will be looking at you odd for wearing shorts."

JapanTravel,3bf6zm,Skateboardingkittens,6,Mon Jun 29 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"We should be careful to differentiate between eating on the train and eating on the metro/subway. Eating on the train or Shinkansen is quite alright. After all, they even sell food on trolleys on the train. But scarfing something down on the subway, especially if it's noisy or messy, definitely looked down upon.  Eating while walking down the street is a different beast. During festivals, you see people walk and eat all the time. Same with lots of downtown Tokyo. I think the best thing you can do is to look around. If you see locals eating and walking there, go ahead. If it looks like you're going to be the only one, don't stand out. Have a sit down somewhere and then enjoy your food."

Some places need reservations well in advance. When I stayed the restaurant I wanted  had been booked solid for my entire stay. So again it depends. Also to go with my first point, if you think you have a restaurant you want to go to find another just incase anything goes wrong. DO NOT try to just wing it unless you and who ever you are going with are 100% ready to just walk around and find a place. Some areas are easy to just walk a block and find numerous choices, but others will leave you eating a tastey (however unsatisfying) snack cake from a seven eleven."

JapanTravel,3bi2eb,xemuj,2,Mon Jun 29 11:59:52 2015 UTC,"Speaking for Kyushu and Shikoku.     Shikoku has some pretty parts, but most of it is kind of run down city areas and rice fields. In general, the big cities are just typical of any large city in Japan, like a smaller version of Osaka or Fukuoka. The main attractions of Shikoku is the temple pilgrimage, the castles, and the regional food.     Onsen Dogo in Matsuyama is really amazingly pretty, and good for long exposure night shots and amusing because people treat the area like an small onsen town, but it's urban. The rest of the city is how I mentioned, pretty normal Japan city.     Takamatsu is pretty run down like I mentioned, otherwise, it's just a city. There are some good places to view the Seto Inland Sea, but personally I think if you go the other side, to Miyajima, you get a much better view. Kotohira and the shrine is nice, it's high up and has a view of Kagawa. But, again, it's nothing amazing. There are better shrines in Kansai area.     Kochi is a nice city, it has more of a modern feel of the Shikoku cities.     Iya valley in the center of Shikoku is really pretty. The unfortunate thing is the train and bus support is pretty bad, so if you go, you will miss a lot by not having a car.     To be honest, with exception to Iya valley and mayybe Dogo Onsen, nothing in Shikoku is really awe inspiring. It feels like the places it excels at is done better by places in other parts of Japan.     For Kyushu, it sounds like you went to some of the best spots. I might suggest places in the center if you into onsen towns; Kurokawa is amazing, Yufuin and Beppu are nice. I haven't gone, but I hear Yakushima is worth visiting."

We offer them here: http://japanwifibuddy.com/products/unlimited-gold-wimax-2?variant=1240164767  One of the things to remember is that with Wimax, your speeds are more affected by where you are. Simply placing the device by the window can speed things up a lot.   Other options that work on 4G like our YMobile device or Docomo devices aren't as affected by where you are in the building. But they also don't can't claim the speeds that Wimax2+ can."

And also what looked like super cool info... Buuut I can't read Japanese so I relied on my current understanding of science.  Second recommendation: (poor description and directions sorry) If you happen to be checking out the Sky Tree in Tokyo the building next to it is a mall or something like it, and the 10th-ish Floor has 2 small rooms that have some working robotics as well as lots of space exhibits, and amars rover simulator. It's not a big thing, maybe 30 minutes is more than enough (At least if you don't know Japanese)... But it was super cool and high tech, it was affiliated with one of the universities. Showing off their stuff I guess?"

JapanTravel,3bh2da,Propriapersona,2,Mon Jun 29 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"Summer months can be busy so yeah, it can be worth reserving a seat to make sure you get the train you want, when you want.  This can vary by route with some routes being more popular then others.   Also, not all routes have non-reservation cars and require you to reserve.   When arriving in a city you can easily go straight to the manned ticket station and get your next leg reserved. While it does commit you to a specific time, it means you can guarantee a seat.  Sometime the bigger cities, like Tokyo > Kyoto are every 15 minutes so it isn't as big a deal, but some routes are much more sparse for depature times so check it out first"
JapanTravel,3bh2da,Vagabond_Sam,2,Mon Jun 29 04:05:10 2015 UTC,"The simplest way to use the JR Pass is to get reservations. You can get them on a preceding day, or you can get them when you arrive at the station on the day you want to leave.  Even an hour or thirty minutes before departure is reasonable.  Some trains only have reserved seating, and others have unreserved sections that may fill up, and since figuring that out can be tricky if you've never taken that train before, the best move is to go to the Green Room or Green Window at your departing station and make reservations."
JapanTravel,3bh2da,sakaibashi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"For long distances, if you want to ensure that you have a seat and not be left standing on the train for 2 hours, you get a reservation.  It's recommended, especially during the peak travel seasons, but not a must.  You can always book your seat just before you're about to leave, but then again, you risk that the reserved seats on that train is fully booked out.  It all depends on your preference and your travel plans."
JapanTravel,3bh2da,ukatama,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:09:32 2015 UTC,"What is your itinerary (including dates) and where will you be ""taking the train a lot""?    Do you know what dates and times you plan on taking most of your long distance trains or do you have a very flexible itinerary?    I tend to book my long distance morning trains that go to a city a day or two in advance. eg. 7am train from Tokyo to Kyoto when leaving Tokyo.  For trains that are returns on a day trip or for late afternoon transfers when I am not sure what time I will finish sightseeing I usually just book them 15-30 minutes in advance on the day.    Obviously the above depends a lot on where you plan on going and what dates you plan on travelling due to peak seasons, holidays, festivals, etc.    Reservations are free with a JR Pass so I tend to use them where possible. If I'm in a huge rush and don't mind the possibility of standing then I sometimes use the non-reserved carriages. Fine for short trips but you don't want to be caught standing for hours on end, or at least I don't enjoy that even though we have done that sometimes."

When I booked my trip in 2013, the cherry blossoms bloomed early and I missed most of the bigger places to see them. They are full for only so long. The time frame of when Mt. Fuji is climbable is a lot bigger, so it's easier to book. That being said, I prefer the cherry blossoms over climbing Fuji, but you can't go wrong with either choice. Yes, it would be hot in the summer months, but it'll also be hot to say that you climbed the most popular mountain in Japan."

Summer (late July - late September) is pretty brutal, Bangkok levels of heat and humidity in most of the country.

In many countries, this is because of late/slow transport. In Japan, it's because you'll want to spend more time exploring and admiring the scenery. My one biggest regret from my trip to Japan was packing too much into each day.  You don't want to be constantly on the run. Take your time; it's a holiday. Just wandering and doing a little people watching or looking in shops is enjoyable in itself.  Maybe you plan to spend an hour at a particular attraction. What if you like it so much you want to stay longer? What if you're hungry afterwards? It's easy to rack up an extra 30 minutes here and there when getting a snack or going for a bathroom break."
JapanTravel,3bex9m,Pugshaver,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"I did Hiroshima / Miyajima in one day a few weeks back and it was exhausting even in May when it wasn't that hot. I decided in advance that it would not be possible to see everything so I had to make sacrifice.  For reference I departed Kyoto at 7:20am and arrive on Miyajima island at roughly 10:20am. My original intention was just to spend 2-3 hours but as others have stated, you just come across things you don't expect. I spent an hour at Daison-in and it was my favourite temple the entire trip.  Departing Miyajima and Arriving at the A-Dome took roughly 45mins (ferry / JR train / tram) and arrived there around 2 pm. After this I headed to Okonomi-Mura for Okonomiyaki. Of course along the way I stopped at various places that peaked my interest.  I got back to Hiroshima station around 4pm and quickly realized that the next Shinkansen would not arrive for another 75mins and it was not even direct back to Kyoto. I suppose I could have done Himeji also but I would have been stupid tired and probably would not have enjoyed myself."

The Danish agency sells tickets for $75 per person (which includes tickets, guide, and transportation). That seems really expensive, since the tickets themselves should only be 1000 JPY(?) = $8(http://www.jtbgmt.com/eng/ghibli/TicketSystem.html#Regions).  I only want the ticket - is there any way I can order that separately?"
JapanTravel,3bcvvl,Fade-out,2,Sun Jun 28 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"It's perfect, I almost only use booking for everything everywhere.  Some really nice places are not on it, but nothing beats the convenience of having everything in one place, being able to modify/cancel/etc in one click.  Also, once (in Japan also), I wanted to cancel a booking but by missclicking, I ended up cancelling only one of the 2 rooms I had booked, and didn't notice it until it was too late for free cancellation. I sent a message to booking, they relayed it and the hotel accepted to cancel the second room free of charge too.  So I really only have positive feedback."

JapanTravel,3bajo9,MoneyWeHave,2,Sat Jun 27 20:32:00 2015 UTC,Great photos! What camera did you use?
JapanTravel,3bajo9,THE_CUNT_SHREDDER,2,Sat Jun 27 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Looks like a Fujifilm X100T, it is a pretty good point and click. It is like the enthusiast equivalent of a non-DSLR. It comes with a APS-C sensor (the same in most lower level DSLRs) so in terms of potenential image quality, it does a very good job standing out above the competition. Also has a 35mm f/2 lens which is nice. Has no zoom, and not the best for fast moving subjects though.  I would also check out something like the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100 if you were looking for those kind of cameras. Perhaps even midrange mirror-less choices like the Sony a6000 for a step up but still avoiding the DSLR market."
JapanTravel,3bajo9,MoneyWeHave,2,Sat Jun 27 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"As you said, x100T - I bought it just before the trip and I have to say it's the best travel camera I've ever owned. Perfect for what I like to do.  I wouldn't say it's a point and click though, it's more like an old Leica rangefinder with a 35mm permanently attached. It has full manual control in the style of the old 35mm slrs (ring and dial).  I couldn't recommend the camera more to anyone looking for a good travel camera, plus a Spider Blackwidow holster to hold it."
JapanTravel,3bajo9,polyrhythm7,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"It looks so much like a Leica! I guess 'point and click' isn't quite right. 'Enthusiast compact' is better.  It is my top pick for a compact camera, along with the LX100 I mentioned above, depending on needs.  That said, I loved using the Leica M type 240. I would not recommend it though, the price is hardly justifiable. If you need something not very hefty but got that kind of the, full frame mirrorless is the way; Sony Alpha a7 is thus my travel camera of choice. I would buy one now if we weren't thinking of  upgrading from a Nikon D700 and Canon 6D to the new 5Ds or D750 (don'twanttolosemylenses;)... Or we will just travel instead... Photography couple problems.   Sorry for the tangent, bored on train."
JapanTravel,3bajo9,MoneyWeHave,2,Sat Jun 27 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"I really wish Fuji made a full frame mirrorless...  The way their cameras produce color right in the JPEG is fantastic.  I've also been wanting an A7 (the A7S specifically) - It's actually pretty much the exact same body size as the x100T, minus lens."
JapanTravel,3bajo9,octave1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"The A7S is like 4 stops better than the A7 and R! It is pretty good in low light (ahaha that's the point of the whole thing). Sony screwed up the A7 II if you ask me though.  If you do not mind APS-C, there is always the Fujifilm X-E2. It is a pretty good camera. The  X-T10 just superseded it. It is essentially the same camera with more features (better ISO and shutter speeds too but same image sensor), so I would get the X-E2 now that it will cheap as a discontinued model. However, that is if you really wanted mirrorless. The x100T is a brilliant camera and I doubt it is worth upgrading in such a small manner so soon unless you are really cashed up (or whatever personal reasons I do not know that justifies the purchase). Also, the gap between fullframe and APS-C is closer than ever, it may not be justified going fullframe (though it depends on your needs of course). The Nikon D7100, Sony a77 II and Canon EOS 7D Mark II are brilliant choices in the DSLR range. There is always the Fujifilm X-T1 (the bigger but slightly better version of the X-T10) for mirrorless too.  (If you cannot tell, I love cameras)"
JapanTravel,3bajo9,zaraki38,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"I do some video work so the A7S's low light capability is a pretty enticing feature (That moonlight video is basically the whole reason why I want one).    Yeah, as of now I don't see myself upgrading to anything - the X100T is perfect for my needs... now if they release a new model with weather sealing and better video...  I own a 7D but I realize now that aside from using it for video, my photography needs align more with the X100T and compact cameras in general."
JapanTravel,3bajo9,Jibbles86,2,Sat Jun 27 22:00:34 2015 UTC,I use a Sony a6000 and I love it. It's so much easier to shoot with compared to my DSLR.
JapanTravel,3bajo9,pyroaries,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"Sony a6000    That is good to hear! Though one of the draw backs of  Sony's e-mount cameras is the lack of lenses available compared to something like Fuji's x-mount cameras but, image quality to price the Sony is hard to beat!"
JapanTravel,3bajo9,ohnoitsrambo,2,Sun Jun 28 06:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yes that is my biggest knock, plus you end up paying a premium for e-mount lenses. That being said, now when I travel I'm perfectly fine using just the stock lens. Maybe I'll take one extra lens with me, but overall when I travel I want to enjoy myself and just take photos without thinking too much about them. Since switching to the Sony, I never want to bring my DSLR on trips. The weight of my DSLR really does affect enjoyment after about 4 hours of walking around.  I just returned from Japan myself and finished processing my photos but I have yet to write a blog post about it. I'll share it here once it's up so we can ""compare"" cameras.  I did quick edits on my Instagram account"
JapanTravel,3bajo9,shanshanjapan,2,Sun Jun 28 14:10:52 2015 UTC,I agree! Was there any post processing involved? I love the look and feel of these pictures.
JapanTravel,3bavdp,MilkMan87,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"As /u/RealArc said, you have to apply for the WHV in your own country. The minimum processing time is a week but I didn't hear about mine until a month later."
JapanTravel,3bavdp,shrewdster,0,Sun Jun 28 12:16:51 2015 UTC,"It's Japan that issues the visa, not your embassy. In your case usually the Japanese embassy in GB. I'd ask them. I guess they would direct you to the immigration bureau of your area, you can try that too (google it).  Also, since you don't seem to be very aware of things (sorry if I'm mistaken), are you aware that a working holiday visa is for part time jobs only ? And even if that's the case of the job you've been offered, ""The main purpose of the stay has to be tourism"", so usually when you mention work they turn you down and tell you you need a working visa sponsored by your employer.  Basically, you have to tell them you come for all the wrong reasons (like you love manga and making trips and tourism) while showing proof that you have enough money to not starve. The ""working"" part in the name of the visa is just to allow you to make some extra pocket money and not waste all your savings, but don't mention something specific, as I said they'll turn you down.  Many friends of mine had nice plans, some money in the bank, interests in culture and exploring the country, and plans for working part time. They were all turned down and/or told to remove the working part of their application, and just show as much money in the bank as possible."

JapanTravel,3bavdp,RealArc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:53:41 2015 UTC,lol what? You have to be in your country to apply for the WH visa. You have to be there in person.  Also I know plenty of people who work full time while on the WH visa. I'm on the WH visa myself and obviously my schedule was too perfect but I put down my ideas for working and got approved just fine
JapanTravel,3bavdp,Gurtang,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:31:58 2015 UTC,"You can be lucky. But since absolutely no one will check your actual activities during your stay, it's better to just do as I said and not mention it. It's something they tell you themselves.   Did you put down that you would work full time ? If you did and got approved you were more than lucky, you came upon someone who didn't understand the visa lol.  Once you are in Japan you can do as you want as I said, since nobody checks. The only restriction is that you have to find a boss who will ignore the law (which is easy on the kinds of job usually associated with the whv, like cashier or waiter, etc). But before that, it's better to act all ""I want to go to Japan to discover the country. Oh and maybe work a little if I need to.""  It all comes down to how much you have on your bank account anyway."

JapanTravel,3b6j35,pissygaijin,2,Fri Jun 26 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yes the Japanese take pride in being very meticulous and serious about everything they do, down to bagging your soap and food separately. Money is also handled with great respect, and that's why the cashier is telling you everything she is doing down to each yen. She is appreciating your money and showing care in taking care of it. It's also another reason why they offer a little plate for you to place your money, because taking money straight from your hand or handing you money from their hands is considered rude and hasty."

JapanTravel,3b5l8g,crabsnz,2,Fri Jun 26 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Even though you talked about avoiding restaurants, I can't help but suggest a place with a nice view and atmosphere, like the Grand Pacific Daiba's ""star road"" at sunset, or the Peak Lounge at the Park Hyatt Shinjuku.  The problem with more ""public"" places is that there will probably obviously be more people. In restaurants you can arrange to have the right table right next to the window overlooking the bay or the skyline, that kind of things.  The scenery from Odaiba is really famous, a friend of mine proposed there (I'd say it's kind of like the Yokohama Pier someone else suggested).  Of course if you're Americans and from a big city, maybe you're too familiar with that kind of scenery.  If you're going late march and the timing for the sakura is right, maybe you could rent a little rowing boat in Chidorigafuchi (Edo castle moat) and propose under the sakura, that would be fun (but the wait for the boat will be long, like 45 mns). I checked it out this year.  Other than that I don't really know. Places like Miyajima at sunset would be really cool of course, but there will be people everywhere in the right spot."

Kyoto -> Hakone -> Tokyo is do-able. There's a direct train from Kyoto to Odawara that takes 2 hours. Do some research into where in Hakone you're staying and how you get there. Most transport around the area is by bus, there are two companies and timetables can be a little tricky to navigate. if you're staying overnight the hotel should be able to help you plan this.  If you haven't already done so try plugging some routes into Hyperdia and get a feel of how long it takes to reach places: http://www.hyperdia.com/  If you're going all the way up to Shirakawa-go you might also consider stopping off at nearby Takayama.

JapanTravel,3b5gdq,bacon_kitty,2,Fri Jun 26 07:42:45 2015 UTC,"I feel it helps to break it down into steps to make it less overwhelming to plan:   Select and finalise the dates of travel Take a look at the map of Japan and pick the major areas you wanna go to (Tokyo, Osaka, Hokkaido, etc). Split the days and allocate them to the locations  Book the transportation for travelling in between these areas. This way you won't keep tinkering with the dates. Find good accomodation for each area. airbnb should be pretty reasonable. Use websites and blogs to figure out what's fun at each place and plan your daily itineraries. Have fun!   I feel what's important is to be decisive at each step and finalise each detail before moving on. That way you won't feel like you need to juggle so many things, and you also won't keep crossing out and restarting your plans. And IMO you're right you should visit Tokyo last (if you're flying off from there) cos you tend to buy more shit in Tokyo."

JapanTravel,3b5gdq,onsen_tamago,2,Fri Jun 26 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are not so much struggling to plan a trip to Japan as you are just struggling with the idea of traveling. First off, get organized. Then start to ask yourself questions about the trip and try to answer them. Ask yourself what you are expecting our of this trip and what your travel style is. This will decide whether or not $9k budget for 2 for a month is sufficient. Will you guys be backpacking or will you need daily hotel accommodations? Are you expecting to travel in style? How many creature comforts are you willing to sacrifice, if any? Traveling for a month while constantly being on the move can test both yourself mentally if you have little to no travel experience, as well as test your friendship with your travel buddy. Plan ahead for that. Or not.   Ticket prices fluctuates widely throughout the year. I have paid everywhere between $800 - $2k for my tickets to Japan, all depending on what time of the year I travel, when I booked my ticket, and which airline I flew with. There are a few other factors to booking flights that will change the costs but let's stick to the basics for you.   I say start reading everything on the side bars on here and r/travel. Read just about every page on japanguide.com that are of interest or usefulness to you and start making a list of places you want to hit up with things you want to do. If you got time, make a rough itinerary on a Google maps doc. This will help give you a very good idea of travel routes, distance relationships from one place to another, and even plot out trains to take (with their prices) because Google maps is awesome like that. If you get a WiFi device in Japan, you can also access your saved doc to help you keep you on track if not serve as a reminder of all the awesome stuff you have read about during your research phase of your trip planning.   Once you have a more solid idea of how to you to shape your trip, come back and ask specific questions that anything a quick Google wasn't able to answer for you. You will find that people will be much more helpful then. Help yourself first so we can help you better."

If money is a factor, I'd honestly say consider looking outside of those places, there's some really charming neighborhoods in Tokyo, 15-30 minutes away from Shinjuku/Tokyo Station (depending) where you'll save a bit of money. Pretty much any hotel/airbnb/hostel that's within a 5 minute walk of a station will suffice."

JapanTravel,3b290i,EmberHands,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:59:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking Shinjuku since it's easier to travel to anywhere else from there. Did you also travel to other cities? I guess my concern is whether it would be difficult to carry luggage across to tokyo station on the subways.
JapanTravel,3b290i,lyra1227,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:10:08 2015 UTC,Yep. I went Tokyo - Kyoto - Kanazawa - Tokyo. Although I picked up the Shinkansen in shinagawa. Especially for shinjuku you need a planned route through the station. Find elevators beforehand and do not attempt to take luggage through during rush hour.
JapanTravel,3b290i,MoneyWeHave,2,Fri Jun 26 11:57:10 2015 UTC,If budget is an issue look for places that aren't as popular but yet only a few stops from the major areas. I stayed in Ebisu with Airbnb and it was 25% cheaper than Shibuya which was just 1 stop away.

Those were nowhere to be seen on the actual JR Pass voucher. I went to the train station in Japan, gave them my voucher, and they let me choose the actual dates I wanted to use the pass.   2) It seems to be hard to find info on the fall Takayama festival, I considered going last year but we decided not to solely because I couldn't find answers to the same questions you're asking.  Good luck! If you do go, perhaps you could update us later?  3) I don't know the answer myself, but Japan-Guide has been incredibly accurate in helping me figure out things relating to being in Japan. I'd defer to them with the driving permits, if it's correct, it looks like you just need an IDF.  I can't really help with your other questions, but good luck!"

The exchange voucher is only good for 90 days from date of issue, so I think that JTBUsa wanted to confirm that activation would occur within that period.   It seems that what is usually called the ""activation date"" by most people is actually the start date, but sites such as this one consider activation date to be the exchange date."

I may go ahead and pick up a couple of 1-week JR passes just in case I decide to do a burst of travel at points in my trip, and just deal with normal costs outside of that.  It would cost over $1,300 to have JR passes cover my whole trip, which is pretty steep.  I'll definitely be going to the festival, so I'll be sure to do a write-up afterward since there seems to be a dearth of info on what the experience is actually like.  I think you're probably right about just needing the IDF.  I'll get that done anyway, and hopefully not have any problems while I'm over there."

It is valid for one year, after which you will be forced to take the driving test to get a Japanese license. Do note Japan drives on the opposite side as we do in the States. So please be careful.   Source: I've lived in Japan with American friends who did the above."
JapanTravel,3b3p0x,rukutksvo,2,Thu Jun 25 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"I've not visited the festival myself, so don't take my word as it is. But anyway...  How crowded does the fall Takayama festival get ?  According to Japan-Guide:   The Takayama Festival is a very popular event, visited by several hundred thousand people from across Japan and the world.   You can get a rough idea what it would be like:  Youtube list by keywords ""takayama festival autumn"", ""same keywords, but in Japanese"".  How late do events usually run in the evenings?  Again from Japan-Guide:   Evening Festival  October 9: from around 18:00 to around 21:00   Other couple of sites confirm it. Gifu Travell Guide (scroll down to the bottom), Official tourist information site of City of Takayama (in Japanese).  I'm concerned that the trains may stop in the evening before events are done for the night.  You can always check the train timetable on Hyperdia, also Interval time table.  In summary, evening event ends around 9:00pm. The very last train departs at 9:45pm for Gero. Gifu Travel Guide above says it takes you about 20-minutes by foot to Takayama station from the area events are held.  One thing I noticed that I think should be mentioned  Events at the festival could be cancelled due to weather condition. The festival floats (yatai) are designated as nationally important cultural property. Getting wet in the rain can be critical damage to them (they are mostly made of woods). Events on Spring festival this year (14th April) were cancelled due to rain (in Japanese), actually. I recommend you have a backup plan for the period in Gero or Takayama just in case.  Hope this could be of any help, excuse me for my poor English."

But planners in Japan are cognizant of train schedules. Matsuri don't usually go that late anyway.  You can drive on an international permit for up to six months, then you need to take the test There are car rental places everywhere, but the local ones don't have english There is a scene (Tokyo has every scene you can possibly imagine), but I have no idea how easy it would be to get a gig."

JapanTravel,3b4hea,Gonazar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:46:23 2015 UTC,"Do you have exact dates?    Yes, my advice would be to just buy a 7-day JR Pass. Set the activation date when you exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass when you arrive in Japan. I would do this at the airport or during your first day in Tokyo, just make sure you specify the correct activation date.  Once you have the actual JR Pass you can also start making your seat reservations so you can, for example, book your Tokyo - Kyoto Shinkansen. This saves you a lot of time on the morning you transfer to Kyoto. I usually recommend you leave Tokyo early on ""Day 1"" of the JR Pass, ie. around 7am, to maximise your time in Kyoto/Kansai.     Yes, buy a Suica when you arrive.    Buy Hakone Free Pass for Hakone:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_008.html    Most of your small day trips from Tokyo can be handled via other passes or just by Suica. eg. Tobu Passes for Nikko.  Just note that given your current list a 7-day JR Pass actually doesn't save you much money if at all, but it will give you flexibility from Kyoto. Especially true if you decide to day trip somewhere like Hiroshima/Miyajima.  You may wish to include a half-day trip from Kyoto to Himeji Castle also. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3501.html"
JapanTravel,3b4hea,david_131,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:04:19 2015 UTC,If you haven't already got your tickets look into flying out of Kansai instead of having to return to Tokyo. It ends up costing about the same (or sometimes less) but you save a lot of time.
JapanTravel,3b4hea,xinganbaobei,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"If you can get all your Shinkansen travel within the same week you should get a 1week pass. Otherwise no pass would be my choice.   With limited time you want to use the Shinkansen, I usually recommend getting a 1 week railpass and then using the Shinkansen every day during that week so you can get to see a bunch of new places.   A 1 week pass won't save you much money over a round trip between Kyoto and Tokyo. But if you do 7 trips of equivalent distance? You just got 7 times the travel for the price of one."

JapanTravel,3b0fg8,el6478,4,Wed Jun 24 23:37:14 2015 UTC,Looks like most questions are covered. One point of caution - English is very uncommon outside of the large central cities. You won't really find many English speakers in Hokkaido.
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,jaqueass,4,Thu Jun 25 01:19:32 2015 UTC,I had the same question as you. Your answer to #3: https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/33usb4/what_is_it_like_being_an_asian_gaijin/
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,1PercentDivergence,3,Thu Jun 25 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"Good dates. It's just after the Obon vacation! I hope you like walking! You can walk from Heian shrine up to Gion, up to Kiyomizudera. And enter the temples along the way.   Is it worth it/safe to climb Mt. Fuji? Since I am going alone (and I am a female as well), would it be safe? Also since I am backpacking, I won't be carrying a ski jacket from home. Are there places to rent them (and hats and gloves as well)? I really like mountains and I would love to see the sunrise on Mt. Fuji.   One website: http://www.garyjwolff.com/climbing-mt-fuji.html   What is there to see in Tohoku? I feel bad for passing through it in my itinerary. I want to see Dewa-sanzan but apparently it's hard to get to? Also would it be similar to Koya-san?   I haven't been to Tohuko myself. Soon maybe. Someone has been asking about Dewa-sanzan, you might find more info here.   I am a Chinese-Canadian, so are there any things I should know as an Asian-gaijin (i.e. would I be treated differently from other gaijins)?   Not really. Treat everyone as you would treat yourself or friends. They can be friendly without speaking a word of English. If they do speak up in English, get yourself ready to have a tour guide for the day! (read as ""You'll be tired walking all day"", this happened to a lady whom I shared a hostel with.) If somebody irks you just let it be, walk away. (I'm a short brown Asian, and I don't attract too much attention. Sometimes other Japanese even ask me for directions while I'm in vacation at those tourist spots.)  Have fun, enjoy Japan."
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:32:37 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the advice! The links are really helpful. :)
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,jaqueass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm half-Japanese and was mostly treated in a friendly way. I did run into someone in Nara once who told me that it was bad for interracial couples to have kids because it was confusing and unhealthy for them. Every country has its conservatives I guess.  Just remember that Japan is 99% Japanese, so even if they aren't maliciously racist they don't really know much about other cultures. This inevitably means that most of their perceptions of other cultures are based on stereotypes."
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,JapanWifiBuddy,3,Thu Jun 25 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks like you have quite a trip coming up! Good work :D   Regarding Mt. Fuji, one thing to be aware of is that, ever since it became a World Heritage site, it is apparently exploding with hikers all day. So I think it's unlikely you'll be caught alone in the middle of a forest somewhere and find yourself in trouble.   You won't be treated any different from other gaijin, except people may be surprised if you can't speak Japanese. But they'll understand quickly, especially in the bigger cities! I find that most Japanese people are really delighted if you go out of your way to say ""thanks"" or whatever in Japanese, when you're clearly not Japanese.   Hokkaido's gonna be really refreshing for you at that time of year! We're up in Sapporo, so we're down to meet up if you would like to!   Tre"
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,jaqueass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:18:37 2015 UTC,I am still debating on whether I should go to Sapporo or not. I can't drink so I feel like I'd be missing out on the best part of Sapporo if I go. What else is there to do/see there?
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,jaqueass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:28:36 2015 UTC,"I like Hokkaido a lot, but it can be a bit tough to get around without much Japanese knowledge. There's a few landmarks I can think of: Daisetsuzan (park/mountain), the crane preserve, the zoo in Asahikawa (great zoo, though not as good as Nagasaki's biopark for sure).   Niseko is a little weird to get to but is a very English friendly town - the joke is that it's half Australians. But other than Niseko, don't be surprised if you spend five days there and never see another white person!  Also FYI the drinking age is 19 in Japan, and they don't really care/card at all. It's mostly the trust system."

JapanTravel,3b0fg8,jaqueass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Oh whoops. It is 20; I went when I was 12 and then not again until 31, lol.  Though according to Google's automated result:   But, let's just pretend that people care for a moment. The minimum drinking and smoking age is 20 years old, the age when people are considered to be “adults” in Japan. There are laws against consuming, selling, or giving cigarettes or alcohol to minors, but nobody listens.   When it comes down to it, as a non-Japanese you'll look older anyway. Convenience stores simply pop up a screen asking you to click ""yes"" to confirm you're 20. And there's always vending machines for beer on the street too. Nobody really cares.  Hokkaido, only onsen I went to was La Vista Daisetsuzan. It is a little remote (they have a shuttle bus from Sapporo or Asahikawa, but honestly I found it pretty confusing even knowing some Japanese), but it was beautiful and fun. It's a remote ryokan hotel with extensive baths."

JapanTravel,3b0fg8,dawgpound12,2,Thu Jun 25 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"In regards to #3:  I'm female Chinese-American from California, and I lived and worked in Japan for a year. Specifically, it was in a smaller town, nothing like Tokyo or any of the big cities. Yes, the Japanese are very friendly and helpful, and as long as you try to use some Japanese to communicate, you'll be fine.   Side story: Because of my Asian face, Japanese people in my town were extremely confused as to why I could speak such good English. I often got questions as to how I learned it back in my ""home country."" In other words, they all assumed I was from China/Taiwan/etc and studied English in school. They tend to have trouble understanding the concept of ""Chinese-American,"" the idea that our parents/grandparents immigrated to an English speaking country, and thus we look Asian but speak native English too. Then once you explain all that to them, they all of a sudden forget that you're still Chinese and they start making comments like ""Oh you are so good at using chopsticks!"" because they think white people don't know how to use chopsticks. Basically, they can understand ""Chinese"" and ""American"" but not when combined into ""Chinese-American."" Just thought I'd enlighten ya. :)"
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,chazchaz101,2,Thu Jun 25 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"Your itinerary looks pretty ambitious! Just keep in mind, the amount of time it takes to get from one place to another is usually longer than expected. Traveling to/from train stations, the actual train ride, and checking in or out of hotels/hostels really adds up!  If you have a smart phone, I'd recommend getting a SIM card with data (if your phone is unlocked) or using a mobile wifi service like this so you can use google maps. It's incredibly useful for navigating the trains and buses throughout Japan. Plus you can use the internet to search for things to do or places to eat.     Additional things to do (not already mentioned by you):  Osaka: Osaka Aquarium and the Yodobashi Camera department store near Osaka Station (there's another huge store in Akihabara).  Kyoto: Fushimi inari taisha and Kinkaku-ji are nice if you can find the time. At Kiyomizu dera, there's a little area called Tainai-meguri that you should try to find. There's a short paragraph about it here. Outside of Kyoto Station, there's a bus stop area. I'd recommend buying the one day bus pass (only 500 yen!). It comes with a map and the buses can take you to most of the big sights in Kyoto.  Tokyo: Tokyo Skytree, Meiji Shrine (Harajuku and Yoyogi Park are nearby), and the Odaiba area are recommended. I've been to Tokyo a bunch of times and have friends there; if you have anything you want to see or do in particular, don't hesitate to ask!  Have fun!"
JapanTravel,3b0fg8,otsukarekun,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"I just spent a little longer of a solo trip in Tohoku. If you're heading north to Hokkaido, I'd definitely recommend stopping alone some Tohoku places along the way! If heading to Hokkaido via train, you'll be able to stop along Sendai, Morioka, Hachinohe, and Aomori via shinkansen. Sendai is the largest Tohoku city and has a lot of neat stuff to do. There is are really nice gyuutan and sushi restaurants at the station. Also by the station is a really neat massive covered outdoor shopping mall and also the AER building, which offers a free panoramic view of Sendai from above (on the 31st floor if memory serves right.) I really enjoyed Morioka but if you're time pressed, there's not too much there to do from a tourist perspective other than a castle ruins park and a really neat shrine further east of that. I wasn't a huge fan of Hachinohe so if you aren't spending much time in Tohoku, I'd probably give it a pass.    You'll most likely be stopping at Aomori before you depart the train (or ferry) for Hakodate so if you have some time to kill in Aomori (the northern most prefecture in Tohoku) there are some neat things to do by the JR station. There is a museum for Aomori's Nebuta festival which was incredibly interesting and a nearby historical boat if that is more your thing. The Aomori bay area is neat to wander around and if you have time, visit the nearby Aomori tourist building. It has a lot of neat local stuff and a high observatory where you can view the city from above (costs 500 yen to enter but you at least get a complimentary drink).    If you have more time or if you ever want to more thoroughly explore Tohoku, I'd strongly recommend Hirosaki (castle and a beautiful park), Kakunodate (well preserved samurai village), Yamadera (1200 year old temple on top of a mountain), Hiraizumi (World Heritage site and once rivaled Kyoto), and Matsushima (neat tree covered isles close to Sendai that are heralded as a top three sight in Japan.) I also have a Hokkaido recommendation! Do visit Hakodate. There are a lot of neat European style colonial buildings and even a European style fort, an interesting contrast from the rest of Japan. But my favorite attraction is Mount Hakodate, where from the top of it offers an amazing view of the city (seriously, google it).      In summary, if you are on your way to Hokkaido but want to spend some time in Tohoku, I'd stop at Sendai and/or Aomori because the shinkansen route will take you there anyway. If you have any questions feel free to ask away, I'm willing to help! Enjoy Japan!"

Guess it depends on if you want to see Tokyo at all or not. If you don't want overnight buses you can consider flying with one of the LCCs like Peach or Jetstar Japan between Osaka and Narita.

They haven't ever checked to see if I have a return ticket or not. Unless you are for some reason acting suspicious they will not likely do much more than check your passport and give you the 90 day visa waiver (assuming from a visa waver country).   You may be required to prove that you don't have an intention of staying in Japan/ability to return. If they ask you for this I believe as long as you can demonstrate ability to pay for return airfare they will accept that.   As long as you aren't trying to do anything illegal Japan is generally pretty accommodating and not overly strict.

Haha I've never seen or watched baseball before, potentially, how much does it normally cost? (student so trying to keep costs down)"
JapanTravel,3ayj0v,jaqueass,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"If you're in Shibuya, maybe we can hit up Goodbeer. It's very English-friendly. Maybe we should keep up by message, as jetlag might claim you on the 29th.  I can give you my cell # if you have iMessage (still works via wi-fi, though I'll have my phone disabled) or I can talk via skype.  Baseball I think is around $10-$50 for tickets, but I was gonna splurge for the $50's."

Not too far from Tokyo is the Yokohama English Garden, which is lovely. Also, the Meiji Shrine is one of the best Shrines in Tokyo, so you should check that out :)  Happy to help with any other questions, from the UK myself and I've not long got back from Japan."

JapanTravel,3azci4,LikkleYute,3,Wed Jun 24 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"Phone post but I'll try to give more later. Nara is known for its deer which are sacred. In the parks north of the train station they roam free and headbutt people in search of cookies. Be sure to go, check it out, buy deer cookies and pet them!  Also, maybe look into koyasan near Osaka. Wonderful Buddhist mountain site. Fun to get to. Stay at a temple!"
JapanTravel,3azci4,jaqueass,10,Wed Jun 24 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"Be sure to go, check it out, buy deer cookies and run for your life as it is crack cocaine to them.  FTFY"
JapanTravel,3azci4,gibagger,2,Wed Jun 24 20:09:21 2015 UTC,This comment is 100% accurate.
JapanTravel,3azci4,jaqueass,3,Wed Jun 24 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"Nara is a no-brainer. Go into the parks with all the aforementioned deer and temples.   In addition to that, you may want to check out the grounds of the former imperial palace. It is a ruin, with not much more than foundations remaining, but it may be of interest. If nothing else, it is a nice, quiet open space once you get tired of the masses of people everywhere in the other park.  Osaka has Dotonbori, which is pretty much the exact opposite of everything in Nara. Riverfront shopping extravaganza. Home to the legendary Glico man and all sorts of other things. Go explore. Eat some ramen. Find ridiculous and crazy shops. Get confused at Don Quixote's (this is a chain store with outlets around Japan. Go anyway. It's ridiculous).  Namba area is rather nice as well.  Kobe is a short shinkansen ride away. They have some remnants of their earthquake.  Hmmm probably others that more people will chime in with."

JapanTravel,3aydt8,mybigleftnut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:59:17 2015 UTC,That's good! Flights miraculously dipped down to $850 briefly in February this year (!!!) so I'm crossing my fingers for a similar deal in 2016.
JapanTravel,3aydt8,valyse,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yah, I just checked the same tickets that I booked 2 days ago. It's up to $1870 now. I'd say, figure out a range that you're comfortable paying tickets for because prices jump wildly day to day."
JapanTravel,3aydt8,aznprd,2,Thu Jun 25 19:08:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot of things, so here goes:  Flights  Varies by season and where you live - assuming US for the below costs. Could be as cheap as $1,000 in an ideal situation, but $1,200 is more realistic. If you live east of California, it will likely cost more. High season you could be looking around $1,800.  Lodging  It really depends on what you want to spend and where you want to go. The good news is that if you want to be cheap in Japan, you can be dirt cheap. Even in Tokyo you could stay in a capsule hotel for $15/night. I would recommend you book any hotels for Friday and Saturday nights well in advance because these times get far more expensive than the trivially cheap weekdays (just booked a 4 star in Tokyo for $75/night for next week even). If you stay outside of Tokyo and Kyoto, things get considerably cheaper; Sapporo is very cheap.  Food  You get what you pay for. If you stick to Japanese-type food and don't splurge on fresh fish and beef, food is surprisingly cheap. I could easily get by on $10/day for food in Japan, and that's going out! But you should of course plan for more if you want to enjoy yourself and try a lot of things. The ceiling for high end food costs is similar - perhaps higher - than the US.  Transportation  Japanese transportation is great and cheap. Look into the JR pass. Do not rent a car. Still, if you want to travel a lot this will add some cost. JR passes are now about $230/week for unlimited train use on most trains. Note it's only cost effective for inter-city travel; local trains are cheap.  tl;dr  In summary, as stated above 2.5k is more than enough if you take cheap flights and don't spend a lot. Personally I like to live it up a bit, so I estimate around $200/day for food, travel, and hotel. Add in the plane and that's about $4,000."
JapanTravel,3aydt8,jaqueass,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:34:59 2015 UTC,Slightly more than 2.5k usd is enough imo if you stay at hostels and take cheap flights
JapanTravel,3aydt8,Lapemis,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"Japan Guide has a great guide to budgeting/sample budgets. I found it pretty accurate.  For myself and my wife, we estimated a budget of about 6k for two weeks. We ended up splurging on a few things/places, and ended up spending closer to 8k."
JapanTravel,3aydt8,reol7x,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"I have a 10 day trip scheduled, here is the run-down of my costs:  Berlin - Osaka flights: 480 eur.   Lodging: 230 eur (cheap airbnb/hostels)  Rail Pass: 210 eur.   Which brings it to about 920 for everything except food and certain local transpotation (such as metro which is not covered by Rail pass). Given my experience with previous travels, It should be another 40-60 euro a day, and this includes beers, and eating out all day, with one relatively nice lunch, a combini grab-n-go breakfast and an inexpensive dinner.   So for me, for 10 days, it will be about 1500-1600 eur, and this is without much restraint.   How to make it cheaper:   Use night buses instead of Shinkansen. Not very comfy but you save a night's lodging and train money. Rely on combinis, yoshinoyas and other cheap eateries more than regular restaurants. Don't hit up bars that much, or try to do most of your drinking out in the streets.  Thoroughly plan your days around areas of the city so you can move while walking and can save an extra 5-6 bucks a day in public transportation. An average metro ride in Tokyo is about 2-3 USD.   If I did all this, I could shave perhaps 300-400 eur of my trip expenses.  Good luck!"
JapanTravel,3aydt8,gibagger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"That seems very high to me. You'll have a great time though! My boyfriend and I have done a lot of research (and nabbed awesome priced tickets- only 1600usd for both of us round trip!). We are budgeting about $3000 for our two week trip (4600 including airfare) including JR passes although we are still debating them. We are only staying in a hostel for 3 nights of the trip, the rest will be business hotels (try agoda there are a lot of good deals in the $40-50 a night range and you don't pay to reserve) and possibly one airbnb place we found that is only $23 a night. The business hotel in Tokyo we are looking at has a fridge, electric kettle, microwave and hotplate in room so we can save a little money by eating some meals in (just add water or frozen meals). We are planning on staying in a $250 a night Ryokan in Hakone and going to a couple of expensive things ( Tokyo Disney, Odaiba, etc) so you could go much lower if you can go without. Japanguide and Japancheapo/Tokyocheapo are excellent sources of information."
JapanTravel,3aydsz,Noble-K,2,Wed Jun 24 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"Robot Restaurant is definitely a must see while you're in Tokyo, it's crazy and a ton of fun. I also hope you got Ghibli Museum tickets, since it'll be sold out if you didn't get them already."
JapanTravel,3aydsz,asanisimasa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:25:56 2015 UTC,I did this when I was in Tokyo last month. All I have to say is the experience is mind blowing. A few beers definitely helped me process the whole thing.
JapanTravel,3aydsz,Hodgeasaurus,2,Sun Jun 28 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"That's crazy, you have a very similar itinerary and interests to me!  You should look for a place for June 27th and July 3rd immediately. These are weekend days and hotels are very slim pickings on them. [http://www.expedia.com/Hotel-Search#destination=Tokyo+(and+vicinity),+Japan&startDate=06/27/2015&endDate=06/29/2015&adults=1&regionId=179900&sort=price](Here's a search for June 27th-29th). I like to make small bookings at different hotels to see different parts of the city. Capsule hotels are cheap but look them up if you're not familiar so you know what you're getting into.  The weekdays should have lots available. You can book a business hotel cheap, even 4* ones during the week. Hostels though may already be booked.  If you're into tech and gaming and anime, you should of course go to Akihabara, the mecca for those things. You should also check out Harajuku if you're into Japanese fashion things. Yoyogi park is always popular with cosplayers too, though it seems unlikely with the current weather.  You should certainly check out Tsukiji and get breakfast there once. It's not cheap, but it's some of the best sushi you'll have. Or at least hit up a sushi zanmai and get some chu toro. I can recommend some restaurants and things if you let me know what neighborhood you end up in as well.  I wouldn't worry about the language barrier. Tokyo is extremely English-friendly; I only speak ""enough"" Japanese to get around but am far from fluent. If you get in trouble, try to find a Starbucks; I always find they have someone who speaks fluent English there as they hire a lot of former exchange students.   Or just look at a map and look confused. There isn't much better way to get an English-speaking Japanese person's attention than a confused white person staring at a map.  EDIT: You should also check out the Don Quixote store in Akiba. Ridiculous amounts of cosplay stuff."
JapanTravel,3aydsz,jaqueass,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"Capsule hotels   Word of warning though.   Most capsule hotels are male only. Some have a strict no tattoo policy. The capsules are not sound proof (in case you're wondering), a snorer a few capsules away might make your night miserable (that's the reason most travel tips include bringing earplugs). Good points they almost always have a sento somewhere and relaxing massage chairs. Another option will be ""mangga kissa"" / mangga cafe, I haven't stayed in one though. I feel it is a rung below capsule hotels."
JapanTravel,3aydsz,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"All good points. Worth noting that rather than just being male only, they're usually single gender. This means lots of male only and many female only ones as well (at least in Tokyo)."
JapanTravel,3aydsz,jaqueass,2,Wed Jun 24 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"Understood ... i was just not looking for female capsule hotels. Very few it seems. I only see them on web searches, but walking along the streets I don't notice them."

JapanTravel,3axswa,Oliversum95,5,Wed Jun 24 10:40:33 2015 UTC,"While I'm not climbing Mt Fuji this August (as i did it last year), I would totally recommend doing it at night to be at the top for sunrise. A few things to consider:  -bring a headlamp. It helps to have both hands free.  -you can do it alone as the trail is well marked and there will probably be decent foot traffic along the way. It's a long trek, but feasible to do solo if you're in ok shape.  -bring layers. It is amazingly cold & windy on the top. Gloves might help too.   bring a hat w/ brim. It sounds silly but the climb down is hot and in direct sunlight. I got a hefty sunburn myself.   -bring some food & water. You can buy it going up but it's mega expensive. Plus there are not as many opportunities on the way down.  This being said, being on top of Mt. Fuji was breathtaking. Not only is it beautiful but your sense of personal accomplishment is a pleasant bonus. Best of of luck!"

JapanTravel,3axswa,DaveBombay,3,Wed Jun 24 17:51:40 2015 UTC,It took my friend and I from sundown to sun up to ascend. It took probably 5 hours to decend. For us the decent was much harder as you are just going back and forth down steep volcanic gravel switchbacks. We both fell a couple times too.  There is no transportation in either direction. You could hike partially up during the day (which is a common option) and down before sunset.
JapanTravel,3axswa,evanthepineapple,3,Wed Jun 24 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"As a five time fuji climbing gaijin here are my tips: Go alone, Go at night, Spend a few hours in one of the lodges on the upper slope, Bring some alcohol of your preference to drink in said lodge, they do have sake for purchase (the cheap kind), (It won't take much to get a buzz on up there).  Make some new friends. Explore the top. to many people just go up and then go down after an hour.  Go to an onsen after you get down."

Yeah, the ghibli museum is so hard to get into. I'm gonna look into tickets probably when I get there and see if some are available. Are you also into going tokyo Disney land and sea? Or nah?

JapanTravel,3axb7o,0for,3,Wed Jun 24 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"The five-day pass you're talking about is the Seishun 18 Kippu.  Anybody can buy it, not just people on tourist visas.  With it, you can ride JR trains (not limited express or bullet trains) as much as you want for five non-consecutive days.  You can buy it, use one day (the better part of a day from Kyoto to Tokyo) and sell the rest at a ticket reseller.  Or you could go to a reseller and just buy somebody's leftover one-day ticket."

JapanTravel,3awwvb,Tw1987,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:49:37 2015 UTC,"It is very easy to get around and the language barrier isn't too difficult in the big cities. It's harder when you get outside of Tokyo and Kyoto. I would recommend spending a couple months learning the basic alphabets (katakana alone will enable you to read half the menus out there), but it doesn't sound like you have time.  You can still go and have fun and I'd recommend it. But it'll certainly be harder without some language familiarity."
JapanTravel,3awwvb,jaqueass,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, go for it, katakana and hiragana are very simple and you could learn them in a few days, if not one. katakana would likely be the most useful to you because it is generally used for foreign words.  Definitely try to research things that are of interest to you! I love music and art so I found a few cool concerts and galleries to see while I was there.  Good luck studying and have a great time, whatever you choose to do!"

JapanTravel,3atcfj,Tw1987,4,Tue Jun 23 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"Not including hotels and transportation, you would be comfortable with a budget of around $2,500 USD spending money (food, shopping, entry for events etc) for 2 weeks, the more the better. It can be done for less but i personally like to enjoy my holidays and i did a fair bit of shopping for myself.   Most of the time we were happy to eat Bento boxes/convenience store food as well (great quality!) and the counter people usually offer to heat the food in microwaves behind the register which is awesome (not usually on train platforms or stations though).  Accommodation was split between us and it worked out to be around $1200 USD each (including a 1 night stay in a ryokan in Kawaguchiko). I did look around for deals though on your usual accommodation websites like agoda and expedia. Hope that helps!"

JapanTravel,3atcfj,EmberHands,2,Tue Jun 23 11:11:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Btw the only time we took our luggage on the Shinkansen was in between transferring hotels. Myself and partner had a piece each of big luggage with wheels (like in the beginning of the vid) each and that got a bit tricky at one point on a packed Shinkansen from Kyoto on our way to Kawaguchiko (via multiple transfers). We managed to get a dual unreserved seats with our luggage in front of our legs (partner had stretched out over my lap to save space) and it's tight (I'm around 5""10 and 88kg) but it can be done.  Top storage is not suitable for big luggage bags with wheels. I wouldn't go any larger than cabin bags (maybe slightly larger) up top on Shinkansen rides. Hope that helps!"

JapanTravel,3av1ci,Kaylemonade,2,Tue Jun 23 19:00:53 2015 UTC,"Amanohashidate is definitely a full day - it's at least a two hour train ride from Kyoto (3 if you base yourself in Osaka) but it's worth it. It's a beautiful area and it's one of the Three Views of Japan which not many people see, so you can mark that off. :)  It is, however, a bit of a trial - to go from Namba station in the southern area of Osaka City, it's 5 trains, with four changes, over three hours... one way. You can use a rail pass most of the way, but the last two legs are owned by the private Tango rail company, and I don't believe they accept the railpass. It's 770Y one way for that leg. JR Passes are excellent, but the further west you go, you will run into private trainlines that don't use it.  Everything else looks good, and do-able. Just remember to allow for travel times to and from whatever you're doing - it's amazing how many people forget. Osaka, Nara and Arashiyama are within ~30 train travel from Kyoto, so that makes it easy to relegate them to day or half-day trips. (I find that Nara city - ie, the deer and main temples) can be done in a morning, and then have lunch there, or head back)  As for Ryokans, you're looking at travelling over right at peak cherry blossom season, so it's no wonder they're going fast. They're worth the experience for one night, but honestly, I'd take whatever you can get."
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Sciby,2,Wed Jun 24 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"The main cherry blossom season in kansai and kanto is more on the first week of april. However the 3rd week of april the sakura usually blossom around mt fuji, that's quite a sight, weather permitting.   You can find pretty good deals on ryokans on sites like booking or japanican, if you can afford it I'd strongly advise to try one, with a good open air onsen, and food included :)   For just à round trip tokyo/kyoto you don't need a jr pass, it's pretty much a wash. You can save more by taking a night bus but that's of course less convenient (you can also do one way by bus, the other by train...)   Only things in your program I feel like need advice are Hitachi Park (check the blossom ""program"" on the site ; it's kinda far from Tokyo and maybe not worth it) and amanohashidate : doable as a day trip but also kind of far, and really needs good weather so if it's rainy or completely cloudy, not really worth the trip.   Also maybe consider a fujisan day trip if the weather is good :)"
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Gurtang,2,Wed Jun 24 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Plus one for the open air onsen. Gurtang speaks the truth.   The main cherry blossom season in kansai and kanto is more on the first week of april. However the 3rd week of april the sakura usually blossom around mt fuji, that's quite a sight, weather permitting.   Fair call but -  but most people book their holidays taking up all the hotels for mid april. The fever pitch around it is amazing - reports on the tv weather reports, trying to predict the bloom time, etc.  Yoshinoyama in Nara prefecture is also great for late season cherry blossoms.  Amanohashidate: I dunno, I do and don't agree if it's rainy. It's much better in the sun for the touristy sites for sure (it'd suck to be on the chair lift in the rain), but I like the whole area and think it's worth visiting even if the weather isn't perfect. (that said, I dated a girl in Miyazu for a while, so maybe I'm biased)"
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Sciby,2,Wed Jun 24 05:09:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah about the sakura that's for sure, and that's also the time when many countries have holidays so the amount of foreign tourists (especialy western) gets a big bump, but still, a big part of tourism in Japan is japanese people, and those are the ones who will, for instance, completely book Kyoto on the week-ends late march/early april. :D  About Amanohashidate, the thing you have to consider is the fact that it's quite a hassle to get there. That's why I think that when you're making a short trip in Japan, if the weather is bad your time and energy are better spent doing something more easily enjoyed."
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Gurtang,2,Wed Jun 24 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"C'mon man, I just want to see if OP will do the 3 hour four-or-five-trains journey up there just because I ranted on about how great it is in the rain. ;)"

JapanTravel,3av1ci,jaqueass,2,Wed Jun 24 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"Since you are going from Tokyo to Kyoto on (I assume) the shinkansen, get the JR pass as it will be more than worth its cost. But do remember it does not work on non-JR lines."
JapanTravel,3av1ci,jaqueass,2,Wed Jun 24 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"So - I've been doing trips like this for 2-3 weeks for the last few years, and would consider this way too much to do in one trip. You will just be running around all day if you do it as many of these things are full day activities.  Stay in Kyoto for 3-4 days. Kyoto itself has some interesting points (kiyomizudera, other temples, the city itself) and is worth a day. Fushimi Inari takes the better part of a day as well. It's about half an hour on the train, and then you hike around for maybe 3 hours on the mountain. Then you've got arashiyama and the monkey park. Nara is also a good day trip; you can get there in about 45 minutes by train, so no need to stay there.  I figure that alone is 3-4 days plus travel time, so is almost half your trip.  Tokyo has an immense number of things to do. Each town has its own culture. Check out what you stated, but also check out places like Harajuku, Shibuya, Akiba (if that culture is your thing; even if it isn't check it out for how bizarre it is), Asakusa, Ginza. Disney Sea and Odaiba will take a day as well as they're a little remote. Kamakura will take a day (I think it's about 90 minutes on the train?). I didn't find the buddha that interesting, but there's another temple down the road south of there that is way more interesting (and has a network of caves and shrines!). Hakone is a day as well.  If you're going from tokyo to kyoto and back, then yes a JR pass is worth it. If not, then it's more questionable. I think Tokyo => Kyoto is $120 or so (might not be up to date). The other trips (aside from Hakone) will all use local trains which are cheap.  Ryokan are worth the extra money, but you're paying for the experience and the food. Most ryokan will come with an impressive and elaborate kaiseki meal or two. Be sure to look up the reviews and the food before booking. Also, note that the prices are PER PERSON for ryokan, not per room. This is a common mistake and gets a lot of folks in trouble. Many also take cash only.  I am not sure on the tea ceremony, I've only really done them in Kanazawa and other places you're not going. Still, it's mostly a tourist thing and not a ""real"" tea ceremony. You can do them at a lot of touristy temples or (paid) parks. You can also try geisha districts like Gion in Kyoto.  Feel free to ask any other questions you have."
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Tw1987,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I feel it will be too rushed too. We are taking off Amanohashidate and Hitachi Seaside Park. When you say 3 hours on the mountain for Fushimi Inari are you referring to going through all of it? We planned on only walking up a bit just to check it out, not necessarily through the whole thing or anything. I read we could spend just 30 minutes to an hour doing that but maybe I misunderstood.   We booked 1 night in Tokyo for when we land, 3 nights in Kyoto, then were going to head to Hakone for one night, then back to Tokyo for Disney Sea and all Tokyo sites for the remaining 4 nights.  We are thinking of doing Nara and a couple sites in Osaka (mainly just Himeji castle and eating) on the second 'Kyoto' day (just mean second hotel day there as home base).   I know we will be rushing through the temples/shrines to see as much as we can in the short amount of time we have but I hope it will still be enjoyable. If we sense that is it much too rushed, we can slow down and cross certain things off the list. I will most likely bug you again for more help! haha thank you so much!"
JapanTravel,3av1ci,Tw1987,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:22:45 2015 UTC,On phone so will be brief. Fushimi is a good half day for me at least. The real enjoyment is hiking up the hill and stopping by the little cafés on the hillside. Great view of Kyoto halfway up too.
JapanTravel,3av1ci,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"What i did was start in Osaka then ended up in tokyo so i didn't have to travel back. Flew from KIX to HND. you can do HND to KIX if you have no reason to go back to tokyo other then the flight.  Arashiyama/Monkey Park, Kamakura, and Nara are all good day activities - but it seems you should plan some night activities. An example of what we did was Nara during the day and Dotonbori/Shinsaibashi Area at night. If you arent into shopping/drinking/food then I guess you don't really need a night activity.  edit: Flew in to LAX > KIX left from HND > LAX"

You can check out this link on japan guide to see if you are eligible for any.  if you want just normal tickets, there's nothing stopping you. just go to a midori no madoguchi and just tell them the dates you'll be travelling, from which station to which, and they'll make the reservations when you pay. you'll have to pay for each trip individually just like a japanese person would.   Edit: I'm wrong. I stand corrected. Had no clue about 途中下車."

Just go to the manned gate and tell them it's 途中下車 (tochu-gesha). I do this all the time; getting off at Shizuoka on my way to Nagoya.  Edit: see /u/ruffas's link; it explains it in detail much better than I."

JapanTravel,3axgby,hodex,30,Wed Jun 24 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"It's an incredibly bad idea to try and buy drugs in Japan   The police make a concerted effort to catch foreigners with drugs and make an example out of them. There is no ""warning"" or ""looking the other way"" having marijuana in Japan is like possessing child porn in Australia. You will go to jail/deported and there is NO leeway. From what I understand those that do drugs in Japan have strong connections in the drug community to protect against police interference and you aren't likely to break into those communities as a tourist. If you can't go overseas without your drug of choice exactly how dependant on it are you? I wouldn't dream of trying to buy a beer in Saudi Arabia, why can't you go for a few weeks in Japan without weed? That's pretty sad. Different cultures have different values. In Japan you can buy booze anywhere, drink pretty much any place with no hassle from the Police. In Australia you run a pretty high risk walking along the street with a beer.    TL:DR - You won't be able to find it. Even if you do it's not worth the risk."

JapanTravel,3as007,parricc,3,Tue Jun 23 01:11:03 2015 UTC,"I did Dewa Sanzan in 2013. Haguro-san is easy, hardly any preparation required. If it is a bit rainy wear shoes that don't slip easily on wet stones. There is a rest stop somewhere halfway the trail which gives you a certificate (at least, they did for me): http://i.imgur.com/wEsoui7.jpg http://i.imgur.com/OGIqfes.jpg  Here are the bus times:   http://www.shonaikotsu.jp/local_bus/img/jikoku_PDF/20150401/t10_haguro.pdf (Japanese)  鶴岡駅前②のりば = Tsuruoka station No 2 bus stop   随神門 = Zuishinmon. You want to get off here and walk the rest.  羽黒山 = Haguro-san  月山八合目 = Gas-san 8th station.   I didn't stay at temple logding; I took the bus back to Tsuruoka the day I did Haguro-san, and took it again the following day all the way to Gas-san. TIP: Take the very first bus so you don't have to rush (see below)! (6:00 am departure from Tsuruoka, 7:00 am Haguro arrive at Gas-san 8th station at 8:00)  http://www.shonaikotsu.jp/local_bus/img/jikoku_PDF/20150401/t11_yudonosan.pdf (Japanese)  湯殿山 = Yudono-san. Note that the last bus leaves 16:45. That's why I advise to take the very first bus from Tsuruoka, to give you plenty of time to climb. Alternatively find logding at/near Yudono-san or some other way to get back (I guess a taxi will be extremely expensive).  Like with Mt. Fuji, if the weather is bad, you might want to reconsider climbing Gas-san and Yudono-san. Gas-san isn't terrible, you could do it and return, but the decent from Yudono-san was quite bad (for me). It's so steep at times there are even ladders down (no kidding): http://i.imgur.com/ukHyndN.jpg  I didn't take the first bus (bit of a mistake) so while I didn't have much trouble getting to the Gas-san summit, getting to Yudono-san was not very fun, mainly because I knew very well when the last bus was going and didn't have a clue what to do should I miss it. Apart from that the path to Yudono-san was pretty difficult. It was also not really properly marked, I ended up looking at Google Maps a lot (if you have an unlocked phone get a sim-card or rent a mobile wifi) to see if I was still going somewhat the right way. It was telling that most of the Japanese (the path to Gas-san was quite busy despite the weather) didn't go to Yudono-san (or so it looked like). Either that or I took the wrong path. The only two people going the same route as I was were two other foreigners who were a little ahead of me. If you want to take that route (from Gas-san to Yudono-san) I'd recommend arriving at Gas-san no later than 12:00 max so that you have the rest of the afternoon to get to Yudono-san. It's better that you have to wait for the bus than the have to rush for it (which I ended up doing).  There is a small tourist office on the left side of Tsuruoka station (to your right when exiting the station) that might be able to give you a few maps etc.  More photos from my trip: http://imgur.com/a/z5uGA"

JapanTravel,3as007,SlimePrime,2,Tue Jun 23 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"Did Dewa last year, first off great choice. Secondly Haguro takes all of one hour to hike, you're going to have a very slow day if you stay there.  Thirdly it doesn't really matter how you split it up, honestly all three are doable in a single day if you take the first bus from Tsuruoka station around 5AM or whenever it was, hike Haguro quick, bus to the entrance of Gas-san from Haguro on the second bus of the day IIRC, then leave on the last from Yudono's entrance. If you spend the night at Haguro you'll have more than enough time by taking the first bus of the day to Gas-san's trail entrance.  PS: Check out Dainichibo and Churenji if you have time."

I've eaten there enough times... well, enough to do some damage to the crab stocks, and never got a bad serving. Sorry you got the crappy stuff. :/  Hyperdia is a train/transport journey planner specific to Japan. You give it your start station/location and a destination and it'll give you up to five differing options to take, with specific trains, busses, bullet trains, even flights, to get where you're going.  Where it shines is that it's A: very accurate (because Japan's transport systems are very accurate), and B: it's intelligent in its planning. You can give it a starting train station, and one on the other side of the country , and it'll give you each train, with each changeover, including walking time to get to the right platform.  It's great for tourists who know the name of where they need to go, but don't know how to navigate and the right changeovers, etc. Not so much needed for getting the bullet train from like Tokyo to Kyoto, but for local train trips, it's good value.  Edit: Here's a good example of a journey that requires a change http://i.imgur.com/YBntctu.png"

A great example is going to see Amanohashidate - to get there from say, Namba station in Osaka, it's five trains, four changes, and Hyperdia is great for getting newbies to the right place  - it even lists what platform a train will be waiting on.  Man, all this has reminded me of how much I loved just travelling about on the train system in Japan. :)  And maybe next time the crab legs will be better. ;)"

JapanTravel,3aow39,mrkirkland,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:38:02 2015 UTC,thank you!  do you have a suggestion for the days spent in the areas you suggested within 7days?
JapanTravel,3aow39,mrkirkland,2,Mon Jun 22 10:43:21 2015 UTC,"For ease of travel, once you activate your pass, you could go along way West first (like Hakata in Fukuoka), and then work your way back East. Also you could finish with a day and night in Hakone, which is just a short trip from Tokyo so you'd not even need a night bus.  So here's an suggestion:  Tokyo -> Hakata -> Osaka + Kyoto -> Nagoya -> Hakone -> Tokyo  Also, there's a festival in Hakata on the 11th and 14th http://japancheapo.com/events/hakata-gion-yamakasa/  And check out the Gion Festival while you're in Kyoto. http://japancheapo.com/events/gion-festival/"
JapanTravel,3aow39,mrkirkland,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:33:12 2015 UTC,"is it really doable in 8-9days? from 11th-19/20th. isnt Fukuoka like really far?  what would be your recommendation in the days spend in each area?  thanks, i'll definitely check out the festivals!"
JapanTravel,3aow39,mrkirkland,2,Mon Jun 22 08:42:05 2015 UTC,"Fukuoka is 5-6 hours on the Skinkansen, plus Osaka and Kyoto are just next to each other so it's defintely doable in 8-9 days. If you fancy a slower pace, then you could leave out Nagoya and/or Hakone.  Actually, Tokyo, Hakata (or Akita), Osaka + Kyoto is already a pretty great trip."
JapanTravel,3aow39,KaleChipKotoko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"thanks for making me think twice, i might actually cut down on the places i have to go since it feels very rushed for me.   i certainly fancy a slower pace when i travel, it's less stressful.  however i'm just worried that there's not much to do in Osaka if i take away Nagoya, do you have any recommendations?"
JapanTravel,3aow39,KaleChipKotoko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"Go to Kyoto, rather than Osaka. You could easily spend a week just in Kyoto. Osaka is great too, and it's just 40mins from Kyoto so you can easily check it out aswell. But you'll already get a good big city experience from Tokyo, so I'd suggest you spend more time in Kyoto: * Temples * Ryokan * Nature - the river, the hills etc."

JapanTravel,3anrux,Ender00110011,2,Mon Jun 22 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"Japan is generally very strict on any sort of psychoactive drugs. I'm not sure what the particular laws toward Xanax are but it's possible you may need to fill out some paperwork before you travel to bring it in to the country, check with the Japanese embassy in your country for specific details.   Generally you are allowed a 1 month personal supply of your perscription medication, as long as you declare any medication on your customs forms and don't bring in an abnormally large amount that looks like it is not for personal use you won't run into any problems. However certain types of medication are more strictly controlled than others and may require additional paperwork.   Edit:   I checked a bit online and it seems that generic Xanax is sold in Japan, so it is most likely legal to bring in. Still check with the embassy to be sure but it looks like as long as you declare it on your customs form and bring 1 months supply or less you shouldn't have any problems. As long as you are honest on your customs forms worst case scenario is they confiscate it."

So they're actually anti-seizure drugs. Last year when I flew to Tokyo for a few days, I asked if I needed to declare ""prescription drugs"" (I also have type 1 diabetes, so I take insulin as well) and the flight attendant didn't understand the word ""prescription"" so I said something like, medicine given to me by a doctor and she said no. So now I'm really confused. Lol."
JapanTravel,3anrux,PANDADA,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html  It seems that you don't need to declare your medication if it's for personal use and less than one months supply. The exceptions being restricted and prohibited drugs. They specifically mention narcotics and psychotropics, it seems you will need to either apply for permission to import in that case. If it is a completely prohibited drug you cannot bring it in under any circumstances.   I'd say you don't need to declare your insulin, but you should check your other drugs just in case they fall under the restricted category."
JapanTravel,3anrux,kaseijin64,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but insulin is injectable, so unless I read it wrong, it looks like I do need to declare it since I'll have syringes and my pump supplies.

Nobody else in my group did either.  Like others said just one month, in the prescription bottle. And as far as declaration all it asked on the form was ""any illegal narcotics"" so I didn't declare anything.   Just be honest and don't try to hide anything by putting it in Tylenol bottles or anything like that you will be fine.  According to some of the people who I spoke to who travel in and out of Japan alot is that antianxiety and antidepressants are commonly prescribed over here, and the only thing they are ""strict"" about is illegal buying and selling of drugs."
JapanTravel,3ao9v7,JackQHT,4,Mon Jun 22 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"However, the total costs for this trip is listed as ¥12,590...   Because you also have to pay the shinkansen seat charge of 5,620 (which is covered by the JR pass). You'll only have to pay the 310 charge of the Odakyu line.   Q2: Am I setting the parameters on Hyperdia to accommodate for the JR pass correctly?   Pretty much, yes.   Q3: And finally, is it true that the JR pass isn't really good for traveling within a city?   It's not horrible, but say in Tokyo for example, you'll be spending less that 1,000 yen/day and you'll be limiting yourself just to the JR lines, which can be inconvenient. In central Tokyo, there's a lot of non-JR lines."

JapanTravel,3ao9v7,PlatinumMinatour,2,Mon Jun 22 04:15:57 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but it looks right to me. The only other trick may be to do a second Hyperdia search with ""Private Railways"" unselected to check if a slightly sub-optimal, but free, alternative exists."

JapanTravel,3anfyr,padalarang,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"You might check a Yodobashi camera for laptops, although I doubt they will be very cheap. Akihabara is the electronics district in Tokyo and you might find good deals there.  There is another place in Osaka called ""den den town"" that is a bit of an electronics district, shopping there might be a good idea. It's possible you might be able to get a good deal on a laptop at a tax free store as well depending on your own countries taxation policy on such things.   Other than that there are plenty of good places to see in both cities. As a Muslim I'm unsure how you would feel about visiting temples, as a Christian I don't worship at any temples, but I often enjoy walking around the temple grounds as they are usually very pretty.  Asakusa in Tokyo the main attraction is the Temple there, but there are also a lot of places to shop and old style Japanese restraunts and shops. If you are lucky enough to have a clear day the Skytree offers nice views of the city, but if it isn't very clear then go to the Tokyo Government Building in Shinjuku instead as its observation deck is free. Another place I enjoyed was the Imperial Palace grounds as they are also very pretty.  For Osaka I recommend going to see the castle, it's been rebuilt but is still interesting, if you have time also head to Himeiji and see the castle there as its supposed to be very impressive having never been rebuilt. Kyoto is also close to Osaka and is famous for many old palaces and temples.   Make sure you try as much Japanese food as possible as well, I recommend trying a conveyor sushi place at least once."

Don't go to Tokyo Sky Tree, it's expensive and it probably won't be very clear. Do go to the observation deck at Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, it's free and you can have a nice reasonably priced lunch there with nice views of the city.   Less touristy things are fun but hard to recommend unless I know some interests. I like food personally so I would recommend just trying all the little restraunts around, definitely do conveyor sushi. I like a little place across the street from the Taco Bell.   Oh also don't do Taco Bell, it sucks.  Do do an all you can drink Kareoke though, you can do 2 hours for about 4000¥ it's great.   Also check out this place called round 1, Its one of these giant Japanese entertainment centers, you can get something like 3 hours of unlimited Karaoke, pool, ping pong, karaoke, video games, karaoke for 2000¥ or so.

JapanTravel,3an0np,wuerworm,0,Wed Jun 24 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"Debit is definitely more convenient and the recommended route for most travelers. Just be aware of your daily ATM withdrawal/Debit transaction limit as these are often combined. I usually bring a lot of cash and exchange it at the airport upon arrival and supplement with ATMs along the way.   You might get a slightly better rate with TCs however it will be a bitch to find a bank to exchange them, and you'll have to wait in line. The little savings of the TCs exchange rate is often offset buy the initial purchasing fee (if your bank even sells them to you). In the end, for most low/mid-range travel budgets it all comes out in the wash whether you bring cash, use debit or exchange TCs. Some fee somewhere will get you. Debit all the way."

JapanTravel,3an0np,beekachuu,-2,Mon Jun 22 05:22:04 2015 UTC,Currently in Japan on a school trip. College student traveling with highscoolers and Japanese native teacher. A student brought travelers checks he received from his parents and had no fees and even got a couple extra yen per dollar. Because his parents had good credit with their bank they paid no fees for the travelers checks.   Even my teacher didn't know about travelers checks but she said next time that is what she'll do. The student made about an extra $300 exchanging with travelers checks.   So seems to be a good idea.   Although the airport had VERY reasonable exchange rates as well if you want to bring cash.   But as others have mentioned you can just use your debit card in places that accept visa.
JapanTravel,3an0np,beekachuu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:51:02 2015 UTC,Actually the day I arrived at the airport the exchange rate was 122 per dollar and they were exchanging at 120. I don't think 2 yen difference is a big deal and is very reasonable.

Since I helped out, and the manager had taken liking to me, he gave me the same access. The onsen there was partially indoors, partially outdoors, and had different 'styles' of onsen - one had milk added, one had sugar, one had a low voltage current.   Anyway, after relaxing in the indoor onsen, I went to an outside bath. As I lay back, I realised it had started to snow...

As for onsens, you're best bet would be Hakone, since it's very easy to access via Tokyo.

It's about 10-15 minutes away by subway (10 minute walk to the station not included) from Osaka's Shinkansen station, Shin-Osaka.   The hotel is a three star budget hotel according to the internet, but the service is above and beyond and the facilities are great.  They have a Japanese-style bath in the basement, too. I'd recommend doing that at least once.   As for the Haneda/Narita question, I can't help a lot. I flew in to Narita and flew out via Haneda, but spent time in Tokyo too. It's definitely pricey to fly to Tokyo just to take a Shinkansen to Osaka.   Instead, I would recommend looking into flights to Kansai International Airport in Osaka itself."

So now I just need to find a hotel that is relatively near the Yumeshima island, but I can't find much online about Yumeshima island except for old articles from last year about them building the casino.

You might need to get as close as possible via subway/train and then go for a taxi for the rest of the distance.   As for a hotel, I'm afraid I cannot recommend any hotels in Umeda as I didn't stay there. However, Umeda is only one or two stops away via subway from Yodoyabashi, where I stayed. This was my hotel as recommended above. If you stay one week, which I would recommend if you can afford it (as there is a huge amount of things to do in and around Osaka), it would come in at $1020 for 2 rooms, 3 guests.   The rooms are, as (I believe) with most Japanese style hotels, not really sizeable enough for an extra person to 'sleep on the couch'. For the amount intended, however, it is decently large.   The price will of course go up or down depending on if you extend your stay or stay less than 1 week, but I had to pick a time frame to work with. Above prices are via Booking.com for Sept 1st - Sept 7th, you might find cheaper or more expensive if you change the time period."

I think a lot of fans have already booked hotels! So I emailed the hotel to help me get to Yumeshima island. If I find a better place, I can cancel for free until Sept. 18. I booked Sept. 19-26 (so you were right for seven days!). I wanted to make sure I have some place reserved since so many reasonably priced hotels are all booked!   The hotel was about the same cost as yours - they only had one quintuple room left, so if my friend goes and I find two other people to stay with us, we'll save even more. :)"

JapanTravel,3ajnbu,kaseijin64,2,Sun Jun 21 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yes it is possible and somewhat reasonable depending on budget. The shinkansen will get you from shinkobe station to Hiroshima station in about an hour. It'll run you about 10,000yen per ticket for one way. With the two of you, 40,000yen round trip just for the shinkansen from Shinkobe to hiroshima and back.   If you have time I recommend a visit to Miyajima also, a very beautiful island that is one of the world heritage sites.  If you leave in the morning and spend the day there, the last shinkansen back to shinkobe is around 9:30~10PM. I would check on the day you're there to be sure.

BUT- I'd also suggest you pick her up some other candies as well because most of these taste pretty awful. I've tried 5 or 6 of them (I really love those videos) But they have a weird gelatin-y grainy texture.

If you just want to go to Miyajima, I would recommend taking the Shinkansen Hikari to Hiroshima which will take about 2 hours. At Hiroshima station you will transfer to the JR Sanyo line and get off at the Miyajimaguchi Station (about a 30 min ride). Lastly, you will take the ferry to the island which takes just 10 minutes.

Won't be raining, but it'll be like being in a sauna. Find street corners where people are handing out plastic fans, and get a few - these will save you. :)  That schedule is pretty rushed - you're already overloading yourself with racing to cities instead of racing to attractions, which frankly is worse. Travelling between cities involves checking in and out of hotels, dealing with bags, etc etc. :)  That Aug 21st start will be a killer after flying all that way, then getting all the way into Shinjuku then getting up early to shink it up north. Ask yourself if you REALLY want to go there? Is there something specific you want to see? If you HAVE to do sapporo on the 21st, stay right next to the shinkansen station.   Ditch the Yokohama museum, you're going to waste 1.5 hours on a round trip, and Tokyo has tons to look at (unless you've been there before and you really like noodles). Even just walking around Yoyogi Park in Harajuku will take a good chunk of your day, and there's nice areas just to wander about and explore if that's your thing. (Mine too, was my favourite thing to do when I lived in Osaka)  If you do Himeji, take a shinkansen, a ""rapid"" local train will take over an hour. But really, Osaka castle is just as good, if you're not 100% set on specifically seeing Himeji. Kobe, if you're sick of Japanese food by then, Chinatown there is great, with a pork dumpling place that's amazing, right in the centre.  Nara is awesome, one of my favourite places, but honestly, you can see all the important stuff in 3-4 hours. Whenever I've been or taken a group, we've grabbed breakfast, and hit nara at 9ish. We're heading back to Osaka by 12:30-1pm. Go visit Den-den Town in Namba in the afternoon to get your geek on. (it's just as good as Akihabara, it just doesn't have as many shops selling the same things), or take the afternoon to see Osaka castle.  Or... find a spare day to visit Koya-san and the temples. It's worth it (and better than a noodle museum, no offence. ;) plenty of wandering there and some amazing stuff.  Anyway, sorry if it sounds a bit critical. You'll enjoy yourself no matter what. :)"
JapanTravel,3ahque,Sciby,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"It's my first time in Japan so any advice is well appreciated. All the hotels I booked are located as close to a major station as possible. I bought a 2 week JR pass and plan to use the Shinkansen as much as possible as long as the route is convenient.   For the Kansai part of the trip I booked a hotel near dotonbori for 5 days and plan to use it as my base for day trip to the other cities. Are any of those cities more than 1 hour away by Shinkansen? Should I get a 3 day Kansai pass for buses/subway or suica pass?   I wasn't to sure where to stay in Sapporo so I booked a Airbnb apartment for 3 nights near Sapporo station/Odori park, is that a good area?  I understand it's alot of day trips to other cities from Osaka but that was the condition of the trip, the other group threatened to do a $1700 6day/5night bus tour and I absolutely do not want to do another tour. Bad Thailand and northern Vietnam tours left me with a hatred of cheap tours by Chinese/viet agencies. I really don't want to sit in a bus for 6+ hours when I can take the Shinkansen in only 2ish hours  I guess the next part ofplanning is to figure out what attractions are close together and worth visiting and how to guide my group there using the public transportation."
JapanTravel,3ahque,Sciby,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"Well you're going to love it. :)  And especially since its' your first time, definitely trim the list down. It'll be quite a bit of overload, and you want to have leeway to be able to go ""hey, that thing looks cool"" and explore that, rather than have to move on because you're rushing for yet another train.  I lived in Osaka, so I know Kansai best - unfortunately I don't know Sapporo at all. You don't need the shinkansen in Kansai - it's easier to just get a local express train to Kyoto, it's like a 30 minute trip. Same for Nara. And don't get me wrong, doing day trips from Osaka is fine - it's well suited for it, since Nara, Kyoto and Kobe are all 30 minutes from O-town.   You should just get a Suica card, the JR pass can't be used on Osaka's subway, and there's a lot of non-JR train companies in Kansai.  Do yourself a favour and spend some time on http://www.hyperdia.com/en/ to check how long each of your trips will take. Some places can be deceptive - like Osaka's shinkansen station, Shin-Osaka. It's not actually in Osaka - it's just to the north, so you'll have to get in, leave that station, find the subway, then take a 15 minute train ride south to Shinsaibashi station to get to Dotombori to your hotel."

Along with wearing comfortable walking shoes, the suitcase with wheels will make it so much easier to travel in between all the train stations. Even though there are elevators, sometimes they are far away at the other end of the station or platform.   Also, get a SUICA card and load it up. Makes it way easier to take the trains."

JapanTravel,3af19e,valyse,2,Fri Jun 19 19:09:49 2015 UTC,Hi! I'm in the middle of planning my trip and we're the most excited to walk around Shinjuku. It just looks like tons of fun to be had just by walking around but we like shops and bars and tall buildings with lots of lights.
JapanTravel,3af19e,valyse,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"definitely tons of fun. Omoide Yokocho is by far my favorite place in Shinjuku, but also be sure to research Kabukicho, Golden Gai and the Shinjuku Gyoen national garden. Personally I also liked the store Marui. It was like 5 levels of stores and there was one store near the top with really cool trinkets and toys and manga."

I actually started a web series about my travel adventures and what I think are must things to do. My latest one is about Harajuku, Shibuya and Shinjuku. I would recommend those locations since they are jam packed with awesome food and sights to see. After you see these I loved Akihabara. It's an electronic district. If you're not into the video game and comic book culture you can skip this. If you're more into the upscale life Roppongi Hills has tons of stores and high end food/ fashion for you. Do you like the story of the 47 Ronin? Maybe go visit their grave site and afterward eat at Yakuniku for lunch/dinner (get a reservation for this place).  This is the episode with Shinjuku/ Shibuya and Harajuku. I hope your trip goes well and feel free to ask any other questions you may have. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdDCscCVs80"

Should we assume if our wheeled luggage can fit in the overheard storage in a plane, they'll fit in a locker? Is it any bigger than that?   We're going next year and I was hoping to squeeze both our things into one wheeled suitcase--not huge, but large enough that we'd need to check it on the plane. Maybe we'll rethink if it would be more practical to have two smaller ones."
JapanTravel,3af19e,awesumwilly,2,Fri Jun 19 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"So most stations have a small, medium and large size coin locker.

Same goes for those people who get frantic when people don't learn lots of Japanese just for a 7-10 trip.  I'd say also to bring your own toothpaste - Japanese toothpaste often doesn't have flouride, and some brands even have added sugar for the taste. You can buy anything else you need.

Just off the boat, was absolutely amazed that such a thing as all you can eat steak existed. After going back a few times, realized that it just wasn't doing it for me anymore. It just... wasn't that good.  Then went for my first Kobe beef. This was the taste I wanted even though I was disappointed with the serving sizes. But you know what.. the Kobe and Wagyu beef cuts are SO well marbled... they taste delicious, but more than a few bites is overwhelming. (And I love fat!) Those serving sizes are small for a reason.   So I would suggest avoiding any 'all you can eat' deals and just look for something reasonable and affordable. In general, lunch deals are much better than the evening prime time at restaurants. Enjoy!"
JapanTravel,3ah8sj,certnneed,2,Sat Jun 20 06:43:02 2015 UTC,Completely agree. You can pay the same or less for a good meal in Kobe and have a much better meal without coming out feeling like you're going to explode :)

I recommend just doing Tenryuji and Kinkakuji, otherwise you'll get ""temple-fatigue.""  7/9: You're sure you want to do Himeji castle from Kyoto? I understand it's about an hour via shinkansen, but that is really far away for a morning trip. I wouldn't recommend it."

JapanTravel,3agqcj,Sciby,2,Sat Jun 20 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"Good god, no. This is pretty much undoable, you will be literally running everywhere, and rushing through the sites. Sorry. :)  Halve the things you're doing each day.  Nara: Nara has PLENTY of lunch options. As much as I like Horyuji, ditch it. Same as Toshodaiji. You literally will not have enough time to chop and change trains, and see things properly. Nara itself has enough to keep you busy for 3-4 hours. Forget the sake tasting. Go to Nara city, the park is 16 square blocks of parks, shrines, temples, deer and of course Todaiji itself. Plus, there's things like a pretty awesome mochi store.   At night -  ""GET OUT @ Shinimamiya Station and walk to dinner (close to Nanba Station)"" - Nope, you need to look at a map. You can walk if you want, but it'll take 40 minutes. Get the Kintetsu Nara train back to Osaka (the station is relatively close to the Nara city parklands). It won't be covered by the JR pass, but it'll put you exactly below Namba's main station. If you must get out at Shinimamiya, you need to change the Nankai line and get a train 2 stops north to Namba.  Forget Himeji, it'll take at least two hours to get there. Stay around Kyoto and pick 3 temples. If you really need to see a castle, go to Osaka castle in the afternoon after Nara."
JapanTravel,3agqcj,saroka,2,Sun Jun 21 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"Hello for Nara I recommend Isuien Garden to be added and to possibly drop every other temple other than Todaiji. The gardens were more unique than the temples in Nara. There is lunch there btw, but it's scattered about the park.  From my uncle, west Kyoto is not as much worth as going for the big Kyoto temples. The Arashiyama monkey park takes a lot of time and only has a small viewing center at the top and no monkeys on the path. Himeji Castle and gardens take a full day because they are stunning. Be prepared for that. Kiyomizudera is east Kyoto and has quite a few other temples around there that are stunning.  I made a post of what my original itinerary was and what actually occurred in my post history if that can help you."

JapanTravel,3agqcj,its_real_I_swear,2,Sat Jun 20 04:10:15 2015 UTC,"when you are at nara walking toward the temples there are alot of food places. also as you are walking out in that direction they have a row of shops that you cant miss with alot of food.  Honestly unless you are talking about 10,000 yen+ places 95% of the places that specialize in one or two things are going to be good. This was a REAL shock to me as there is good food everywhere. I am a foodie from Los Angeles and you have to drive 30min-1hour whatever way to get to the best of the best of X cuisine. This isn't the case in Japan for the 1000-3000yen meals.  If all else fails eat at the train major train stations and you can't go wrong."

They aren't bad things to ask it's just funny. Also I imagine being black in a country with a practically non-existent black population also gets you more attention.

But after some research I found out that Naha isn't as nice as the other Okinawa island (tho you could take a ferry to Aka island)  But I found out if I left from Tokyo I could use the ANA Discover Japan ticket to Ishigaki island for about 150 euro each. Because that meant dropping our car couple days earlier it actually saves us money. And for a good stay, you got some great airbnbs on the island.

The best way to answer your question is to ask chase themselves.   If you can opt for a credit card instead, I recommend the Bank of America Travel Rewards, since it is free and there is no foreign transaction fee at all."
JapanTravel,3adcm1,wuerworm,3,Fri Jun 19 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"I have a Chase debit card, and it works at any place that accept credit cards. So sure, you can use it to buy things, but the availability to use credit/debit cards isn't anything near what it is like in the US. You will be withdrawing money from ATMs frequently anyway.      Also note, the standard Chase debit card has a flat 3% surcharge for purchases outside of the US. And, make sure you let them know you will be in Japan ahead of time."

I did this on the website, there is an international travel notification form, and then called to confirm.  While cash was my primary payment method, I asked to use the card at places that had a VISA logo. I used it at quite a few restaurants in Tokyo and was surprised by how many accepted it, and many department stores also took the card.  I also used it for withdrawing cash from 7-11 ATM's, for whatever reason, Chase never hit me with a forex or ATM fee.

For example, one withdrawal hit me for $417, then when I looked later after it processed it was $429 or something those lines. I only used my Chase card to withdraw once or twice and used my no forex fees credit card in other places."

JapanTravel,3adcm1,reol7x,3,Sun Jun 21 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"Edit: since someone with the card commented and rendered my original comment void, I'll just say this: Outside of large shopping centers, department stores and some chains, credit/debit isn't accepted.  Things have progressed recently, but cash is still king.  For example, while there exists train pass/credit combo cards, you can't charge a stand pass by credit.  I'm pretty sure the answer is no, you can use it to withdraw money from ATMs though.  This is based on when my brother was here AND that I KNOW that I can't use my Japanese Debit that way overseas, and can only withdraw cash from ATMs with it."
JapanTravel,3adcm1,rainbow_city,2,Fri Jun 19 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"As long as it has the Visa symbol on the front, yes, you can.  Make sure your card is signed on the back. I tried to use my debit card at Donki and was told I had to sign the back or they wouldn't accept it. (Usually I write ""check ID"" on my card backs.) I would also call Chase before you go to let them know you will be using the card in Japan so they don't decline your charges as fradulent.   Also, keep in mind that many places accept cash only, so do not rely solely on your debit card for pament."

There's a little map on the website, so that might be helpful for finding out where to get it in Narita.   They activate as soon as you use them - they work for three days after you first use them.

Once you have initially bought the card you can top it up as many times as you want. I put 5000 yen on mine and it lasted for 10 days. Not only can you use them for the trains but a lot of convenience stores, restaurants and vending machines accept them as a form of payment, so you can just tap the card and you're good to go. It saves carrying around more money and getting lumbered with coins that you might not want to take back with you. You can also use this pass in Yokohama.  How to get a Suica Card. I found this really useful, although the link suggests buying your card from a machine, you can also buy them from the counter, I bought mine from the Information Desk at Tokyo Station.   More information  At the end of the trip, you can give your card back and get the money off, or you could just keep the card. I'm keeping mine for my return trip :)   Hope this helped you, I'm sorry I don't know much about the passes you wanted to buy, I do know however you can buy them from Narita Airport if you choose that option. The train station is under the airport, it's sign posted so you can't miss it. There are ticket and information desks there.   If you have any other questions I'm happy to help!"

You can buy this, in cash, at the Keisei ticket counter in NRT airport.   I just returned from Tokyo and got a regular 3 day pass for 1500 at the Shinjuku Bic Camera (I landed in FUK). If you make at least 6 trips in 3 days, it pays off already (you'll be making a lot more than 6).   The pass can get you close to yokohama but more than likely to finish the trip you'll need to take JR.   As others have said, the pass activates once you use it. The machine will stamp the day you started using it.   Almost everywhere in Tokyo is accessible by the Toei/Tokyo pass. I managed to get to where I wanted to go without taking the JR yamanote.   I still got a pasmo but if you don't mind an extra 5 minutes here and there and the odd additional transfer, the Toei/Tokyo will take you where you want to."

Note that you can set the activation date when you exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass when you arrive in Japan. I would recommend you exchange at Narita Airport when you land just make sure you specify Aug 1 as the activation date.    This will save you time on the 1st and you can also make your seat reservations as soon as you have your actual JR Pass, so if you folloe the above you can make your seat reservation for travel from Tokyo to Kyoto (or Osaka) on Aug 1 when you are at the airport on July 30."
JapanTravel,3aatj0,huhlow,2,Thu Jun 18 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"You could do all 3 Kyoto items in one day. It would be a full day. Personally, I'd do 2 in Kyoto over 2 in Osaka, especially since you're going to Tokyo later for 6, so that you have more time to see the historic buildings, temples, shrines, etc.  Ghibli takes 1-2 hours. It's a little out of the way though so that takes some time.  Definitely do not stay in more than one hotel in Tokyo for exactly the reason you said. Hamamatsucho is on the Yamanote Line which circles the inner city, so that is convenient. If you want to stay out late for nightlife (past midnight-ish), you may want to stay within walking distance of a nightlife district, since trains stop running and taxis aren't cheap. Otherwise it doesn't matter too much. Tokyo has some JR and some subway. You'll want to use both but the pass only works on JR. Most of the value from a JR pass comes from long distance use, not moving around the city. Use HyperDia to research costs.  Tokyo April weather is pretty pleasant. 60s or 70s during the day mostly. Fairly humid. Cooler at night, cooler if it rains (high 40's-50's). Osaka is a little more south, so a little warmer."

Buy an ICOCA when you arrive and use that for most of your transport. You can use it in Osaka, Kyoto, and also for your transport within Tokyo. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html    Are cherry blossoms a priority for you? I would allocate two days for Kyoto. Kyoto is likely to be busy due to cherry blossoms although that depends a little on your arrival date. Consider some of the night illuminations in Kyoto also. Dates will be in blue on this page once announced. Note also some of the popular cherry blossom spots:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3951.html     Osaka to Kyoto is cheap and relatively easy. Roughly 30 mins and 500 yen. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2363.html?aFROM=2157_2158 Nara and Kobe are also quick and easy enough from Osaka. No need for a JR Pass for these. You can look up how to access on www.japan-guide.com and the website www.hyperdia.com is useful for looking up fares and timetables or use Google Maps.    Just pay for the Shinkansen to get to Toyohashi.    There are are not many ryokan in Hakone with views of Mt Fuji, so I would probably consider Kawaguchiko instead if that is important to you. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6906.html    Depends on your budget but somewhere like Kozantei Ubuya might suit http://www.agoda.com/asia/japan/fuji_san/kozantei_ubuya_ryokan.html    Ghibli Museum is probably two hours. Make sure you purchase your tickets in advance either via JTB or somewhere like Bridge Jpn:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3041.html#section_admission http://www.bridge.jpn.com/services/tickets    Just stay in one place in Tokyo. Areas are explained here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/hotels/tokyo.html I probably wouldn't pick Hamamatsucho but it depends what your priorities/preferences are.

JapanTravel,3aatj0,mychyu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your responses!  I did the math on the JR Pass, but you're confirming the decision not to buy one. If I get an ICOCA, should I not purchase an Osaka Amazing Pass while there?  We'll probably arrive in Osaka around April 10th -- I knew it was around cherry blossom time, but because sometimes they are early/late I didn't want to plan too much around them, in case they weren't bloomed while we were there.  But if they are it can be an added bonus!  Since it's pretty cheap to go from Kyoto to Osaka, we will probably try to do everything in one day, and if we think there's something we missed, can go back again.  I think the natural onsen is more important to me than the view of Mt. Fuji.  If you know of any, we will definitely look into it.  Is there a reason you wouldn't stay in Hamamatsucho?  I picked it because it was walking distance to the Tsukiji fish market, and we'd be going early in the morning before the buses/subways.  We aren't very much into nightlife, so I assume that we'd be able to get back to the hotel before midnight on any given night.  But I'm open to staying in other locations -- just don't know where would be best.  Thanks for your answers, it's really helpful!  I've made a note to purchase the Ghibli tickets in January 2016!"

If that is the case, id recommend you to visit the rabbit cafe when in harajuku, tokyo. It is really cute, close to the subway stations and cheap (700y).

The travel time between the three locations will eat up a significant portion of your day if you are not careful.  it will be tight and I would recommend getting in to Kyoto decently early if you want to see everything.

The group tours you are seeing are probably more for tastings.

JapanTravel,3a9wo8,jgold16,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:34:31 2015 UTC,Partially to avoid the crowds on Yoshida trail. Primarily because it means a couple extra hours on the train. We're coming from Kyoto and the fastest way to get to the Yoshida trail is taking the train to Tokyo then head back out towards fuji.

We might even do a round trip between Kyoto-Hiroshima. And for the day trips, we are fine with going really far places with shinkansen. (Just as I mentioned shirakawa-go is one example of that.)"

The crowds for autumn leaves aren't as bad, because the season is spread out over the month, so it's not like cherry blossom season where everyone's trying to see the blossoms over a week period.   I also like late April to May, after the cherry blossom season. This may be a good choice if you enjoy seeing fresh green leaves on trees (versus dry, dead looking branches in the Fall).   In other others, to avoid heat, humidity, and rain, do not go to Japan right now or anytime June-Sep"
JapanTravel,3a9uvp,SakuraKiss,3,Fri Jun 19 06:41:10 2015 UTC,"October and November is your best bet. It's warm still, but not super hot and definitely not humid. This guide is really useful."

Overall your plan looks fine for a first time visit to Japan although maybe a little less time in Tokyo.       Day 1 - (07/07/15)  Gion (Arriving in Kyoto by 6pm)     I assume you will walk down Pontocho.    Maybe move Kinkakuji to first thing in the morning of the 9th and go to Arashiyama from there.     Day 9 - Tokyo - (15/07/15) Tsukiji Fish Market (Sushi-dai)     Prepare to queue. Do you plan on going to the tuna auction? If so, get there by 3:30am or maybe 3:45am. You can walk from Tsukiji to Ginza if you like.     Ikebukuro     Maybe combine with somewhere else unless you have specific things planned. Ueno/Ameyoko perhaps? Kappabashi?      Day 13 - (19/07/15)      I would probably do this order:- Meiji Jingu, Yoyogi Park, Harajuku, Shibuya.     Day 14 - Tokyo - (20/07/15)     Day trip to Hakone, or Nikko, or Kawaguchiko, or Kamakura perhaps? All explained under ""Side Trips"" here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2164.html"

Moving Kinkakuji might be a good idea since those two are relatively close together.  Yeah, I need something else to go to besides Ikebukuro on that day. Probably in the morning? Since there's a few pubs I want to try.  I'm staying in Shibuya so I thought that it might be easier to walk from there to Meiji Jingu."

Some of the temples are short visits, maybe only an hour or two, but there are some that you can walk for multiple hours. Also, there's a ton of shopping and restaurants that are unique to Kyoto. Other than that, that's a lot of traveling. Maybe cut out either Osaka or Kobe. If you are going by yourself, that's fine, but if you are going with someone, it might be too much travel.   Have a lot of fun!"

JapanTravel,3a8ica,1st_ID_was_real_name,4,Thu Jun 18 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"About the area : the Kyoto area is not the best onsen area. It doesn't mean there are none, but you will have more opportunity to find good value for money elsewhere. By the way, it's the same in Tokyo (the big onsen resort in the middle of Tokyo bay needs to go get its water hundreds of feet underground).  Tattoos : my girlfriend has 2 small tattoos (one on the wrist, one on the neck), the first few times she put band-aids on it (that didn't cover it completely), then she got tired of it so she didn't and we were never ever bothered. Unless they're of very noticeable size or placement, I wouldn't worry about it (just maybe try to have them covered when you talk with the staff, just in case).  Well I had not seen your ""no hotel"" criteria before starting to answer... It also means that you won't experience the whole ryokan stay, with amazing food and atmosphere ! :(   Oh, and that also means that my best advice is lost, since it's often in places where there's not much to do that the best onsen are (you go there specifically for that and the staying experience).  So yeah know I can't give you any names for sure. For ryokan stays I always advise Takaragawa onsen (4 awesome outside mixed gender baths and very good value), but I don't know about good ""non stay"" onsen (the ones in Takaragawa are actually public, but there really is no point in going all the way there without staying).  I'd advise you to look up the Izu Peninsula area, pretty close to Tokyo (closest town, Atami, is like 1 or 1 and a half hour away. Other big towns are Ito and Shimoda. With a quick google search I found this that seems to mention 2 cool public onsen (don't know about mixed gender, but you can reserve private baths) : http://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-city-guides/city-guide-atami  Also in Izu you can have baths overlooking the sea, pretty cool stuff.  Be aware though that private baths can be a little disappointing compared to the big ""natural looking"" outside baths you can find in places like Takaragawa onsen.  I think there are also some cool big public onsen in the Fuji area, like in Kawaguchiko. You could check that out if you intend to see Mt fuji. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6902.html  Still, I'm really sorry if it annoys you but allow me to insist on the staying in a ryokan thing : if you can take 1 night out of your trip for it, it can really be a great experience just in itself."
JapanTravel,3a8ica,Gurtang,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:09:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the input! I am not at all bothered by your insistence on trying a ryokan; if the experience is that much better it's definitely good to know.  We'll have to look into it.  We are actually going to do a ""climb Fuji overnight and see the sunrise at the top"" day, so maybe we could go relax our muscles in an onsen around there after the descent."
JapanTravel,3a8ica,Gurtang,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sounds like a nice thing. I just have one concern, maybe you'll be too tired after a sleepless night climbing a mountain (since you won't be able to sleep at the hotels with the onsen...)"

JapanTravel,3a8ica,Gurtang,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:46:37 2015 UTC,"Well it was my personal best experience of an outdoor mixed-gender onsen in the nature, and the price was reasonable.  There are other very nice places but for mixed gender + big outdoor baths + overall experience, yeah it was my best.  Be aware that there isn't much to do in the area, so it's really only for the ryokan : you get there, you bathe, you eat, bathe again, sleep, bathe in the morning and leave.  I'm sure there are many nice onsen ryokan closer to Tokyo (Hakone and Izu), that one is special because of the big baths along a river. Also a lot of snow in winter."

In my limited experience of onsen that have mixed baths (I think I've been to 3 or 4), they appear to only be mixed because they don't want to deal will complaints that the best bath is men only. I've only once seen a women in the co-ed bath (at Tsurunoyu Onsen), and she was with her family (husband and two kids).    Tattoo-Friendly    With 2 & 3, a private onsen for the two of you would make the most sense. Also, you wouldn't be rejected because they think you are yakuza, you'd be rejected because they can use the same no-tattoo stance to reject yakuza.    No ""Hotel Onsen""    I was going to suggest this site, but none of the Kansai area onsen are mixed."
JapanTravel,3a8ica,ukatama,2,Thu Jun 18 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying.  Nudity definitely isn't an issue, I just assumed that co-ed gatherings wouldn't be nude as that is really never a thing here in the United States.  If we can't find a mixed-gender onsen it won't be the end of the world.  Appreciate it.  edit: Also that link you included is extremely helpful.

October 25: Tokyo > Kyoto, Fushimi Inari, Gion     I would highly recommend you leave Tokyo early (before 7am) and go to Kitano Tenmangu Temple Market:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3939.html     October 26: Ginkaku-ji, Nanzen-ji, Heian, Yasaka, Koda-ji, Higashiyama, Kiyomizudera     A long day, hope you like walking.     October 27: Nijo Castle, Nara     Posisble if you don't want to see much in Nara beyond Todaiji and the deer.     October 29: Kinkakuji, other?, Kyoto > Tottori       I would probably see Kinkakuji first thing in the morning of the 28th and then move from there to Arashiyama.     Hyperdia doesn’t show the train I want for Hokuei > Osaka, even though they used to show it and other sites still show it. Should I be worried?      Which train? Is it on Jorudan?     Is there time to do Nara and Nijo Castle in one day? Or should I do the castle on 10/29?     Depends what you want to see in Nara. I think yes it is possible but not ideal.     Will it be “fall” enough for Tofuku-ji to be worth visiting (and busy)?      Almost definitely no. You are in general too early for autumn colours in Kyoto. Obviously this can vary year to year. If you want to see autumn colours during your stay I would maybe do a day trip from Tokyo somewhere. Look back through the Koyo blogs on Japan-guide around your dates for some ideas. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014_when.html http://www.japan-guide.com/blog/koyo14/ http://www.japan-guide.com/blog/koyo13/ http://www.japan-guide.com/blog/koyo12/     Basically, what’s the status of Kyoto’s leaves in the last week of October?     Probably very little/none. Here's a report from Nov 7 last year, just note that last year was ""early"". http://www.japan-guide.com/blog/koyo14/141107_kyoto.html     One of the hotels wants to know what time I’ll arrive. How tightly will they hold me to that time?     Depends on how you have paid (if at all), what time you specify and what time you arrive and which hotel it is. If you are going to be late contact them and let them know. Either via e-mail or phone if you have to. If I think when I book that I might be late then I try and specify a check in time an hour or two later than I will arrive. Arriving early (after 3pm or so) is not a problem.     I would highly recommend you rent a pocket wifi or at least get a data SIM while you are in Japan."

I assumed you'd take the train from Yura station (since google tells me it's close to the manga thing) and just searched from there to Osaka on hyperdia and google. What you can do in one day with Nara is Fushimi Inari, which is on the way of the JR Nara line. It will be too early for the full red thing at Tofuku-ji. Maybe you could still check it out since it's also on the Nara line lol ! Sometimes there can be trees that are very early. Once I was in Nikko a few weeks before the peak of autumn colors and one tree was absolutely, completely red, check it out Does the hotel really need the answer ? Is it not just routine ? I think they may hold you to it only if it's a matter of dinner time, stuff like that (they dine early in Japan)."

This site should have all the info you need.   For arcades, you will not miss the red Sega building once you exit the station. However, they only mostly have UFO machines. Head to the main street. There will be another huge red building with Sega on it. That's where the games are.   Continue down the street until you see a shop name ""Hey by Taito"" in orange. Head upstairs for arcade games (or go downstairs for melonbooks).  These two usually have the most (and better) players. Of course there are several other arcades, like there's one upstairs in the Don Quixote building. Just explore the whole of Akiba, you will find them.  If you don't mind, I can also suggest going to Shinjuku Sportsland, which i heard is another arcade with good players. Also on the list, Mikado at Takadanobaba or Club Sega in Ikebukuro.  As for pachinko parlours, just walk around. They're everywhere. You can't miss them."

It won't really save you too much money but it gives you a bit of flexibility and does cover the majority of your day trips. I would leave early on the 29th so you have the whole day in Osaka. I'd consider a bit more time in Kyoto but I assume you don't have much interest in temples/shrines. I would visit Himeji Castle in the morning before Kobe.    Depending on where your ryokan is located in Hakone there are a few different ways to enter Hakone:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5206.html?aFROM=2157_5200    I would suggest you buy the Hakone Free Pass for your time in Hakone:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_008.html    Buy as Suica when you arrive in Tokyo and use it when you don't have an active JR Pass and also for your non-JR transport within the other cities, like Kyoto subways, Osaka subways etc. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html"

I don't regret buying it even tho I may have saved a few bucks taking the local transportation. Also if you are doing Tokyo to Osaka and back that should be close to the cost anyway. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think Osaka to Nara is not included in the jr pass.  Make sure to budget for local transportation.

Nara? etc. What time do you arrive in Osaka on June 29? If you include the day of the week it makes giving advice easier/quicker. Do not do USJ and the Aquarium on the same day. I would visit the Aquarium in the morning on June 29. USJ needs the whole day to itself. If you want to see Harry Potter World then consider using the Express Passes. I don't understand your ""saving money"" theory. Transportation within Osaka itself is relatively cheap, especially compared to the price of a USJ ticket for example."
JapanTravel,3a82au,david_131,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"We're spending 3 days in Fukuoka, a day in Hiroshima, a day in Kyoto, then Osaka as mentioned above, and another at a onsen in Kobe after the 3 days in Osaka.  The days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I shouldve thought to put that in.  The logic is basically that we're saving money and time where we can. It's not like we can save on the price of the USJ tickets, but we can with transportation. We do realize it's a small difference, but it's there.   That aside, I do think your suggestion about going to the Aquarium on the 29 is better, and my friends agree too. Thanks!"

Sure it's a great clean city to visit but not to spend such an extended period of time. Their main cultural activity is spending time in the shopping malls which gets tiresome after an afternoon.   You can't go wrong with the other two though, picking up a little Mandarin in Shanghai might help you in the future."

And they speak English there, so not sure what you would learn. Even though they do speak Chinese there, you might as well go to Beijing/Shanghai for that.   China and Tokyo has a much heavier and different culture for you to learn from. However, the drinking age in Japan is 20, so you won't even be able to buy alcohol for yourself. China is a bit more lax on the drinking age, so if you really want to go somewhere to drink and club, China's the place to go.   Personally, from a culture point of view, I recommend Tokyo. Japan has preserved much of its original culture and traditions, compared to China."

You can rent a board and car rack from places such as this - http://sourceokinawa.com/rental/ ... probably soft top long boards.  For islands accessible by ferry I'd recommend Zamami (swim with sea turtles; nice beaches). Miyako and Ishigaki/Iriomote are great if you want to fly. Kudaka is a tiny island close by that supposedly has excellent and pretty consistent summer surfing (but bring your board on the ferry) and sea snake soup."

Either fly or take the trains from Sendai to Sapporo.     and Matsuyama-Tokushima portions    Use an extra day to cover this.   It might even make sense to shuffle your order, maybe drop Hakodate and fly from Sapporo to Fukuoka/Nagasaki then work your way back toward Tokyo from there.

I'll say go for it."

I didn't cook at a hostel once, and I ate pretty well (even had high end sushi and some Kobe beef in Kobe).  You have to stay in hostels, they are the cheapest option for sure. I didn't really go out clubbing or drinking that much outside of a few nights in Tokyo, even then I was careful about what I spent. Really, it's the drinking that's gonna make you go over budget more than anything."

JapanTravel,3a41zx,JayKsw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Including plane ticket (~$900). I think on average I spent around $50 a day (not including lodging), occasionally splurging a little. Once I got a JR pass I essentially planned my trips and transportation around the pass (In Tokyo I used the Yamanote line to get everywhere, same with Osaka and the loop line) so I only spent money on transportation on local buses and subways (only took a cab once)."

JapanTravel,3a41zx,JayKsw,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"Ehh not really. The Yamanote line is probably Tokyo's most important line, it connects all the major areas in one big loop (Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ueno, Akihabara, Tokyo) so you can use it to get around pretty easily. Same with the Osaka loop line. You do have to use the other subway lines sometimes, but it's not gonna break your bank to go a couple stops.  Kyoto definitely required more walking, but I kind of liked walking around Kyoto so I didn't mind."

JapanTravel,3a41zx,ThezeeZ,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:35 2015 UTC,"Might be a be bit tight but definitely doable if you're frugal. I'm going to assume it's 14 days, 13 nights.  Airfare: I don't know how much fligths are from USA so I'll just say $1000. Just change it if I'm wrong.  Hostels: $30 per night for a dorm bed in a hostel. Definitely possible to find $25 a nighy if you search around. About $390 for two weeks.  Food: A beef rice bowl at a cheap restaurant should be about $5. Could be as cheap as $3 depending on your appetite. At $10 for two meals a day for 14 days, that's $140.   Transport: this is a bit hard to estimate but I think $10 a day should be more than enough if you're just sticking to one city. Another $140.  After all this you'll still have a little less than $1000. I'll say that should be enough to enjoy yourself."

So how much do you think I  would spend now? DO you think Ill have more much money buy cooking my own food or will it even out after clubs and bars?

JapanTravel,3a57ce,oosuteraria-jin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I have learned coming back for japan yesterday. Other then sushi and Kobe beef, the food quality is similar from place to place.  I make the mistake if being a foodie from California where you need to drive an hour to get the best of the best. I did not find that was the case in japan. Only recommendation I can give is that go to a restaurant that specializes in one thing. Example ramen that servers only ramen or Katsu only serves Katsu. Train stations also have amazing food.  However if you are a skeptic then here is what I would recommend for the ""popular""   Takoyaki anywhere on the dotonbori with lines.   Yasube for tsukemen(type of ramen) in the dotonbori/shinsaibashi side alley.  Kamakura for regular ramen if you enjoy drinking all of the soup. It is a light ramen that you don't feel nautilus after drinking all the broth. This is a franchise so u find it at many places like shin Osaka station or shinsaibashi dotonbori area. If you want traditional tonkatsu ramen save it for Tokyo.  Also for ramen you can go to Kyoto stations version of ramen street on the 10th floor. Not sure if you are headed to Kyoto.  Mizuno for okonomiyaki is popular with an hour wait, but I highly suggest going to a local joint in dotonbori shinsaibashi. Mizuno was probably the biggest disappointment to me.  If you got time for a 8000-10000 yen meal then I would recommend getting yakiniku meal of expensive beef. The shit melts in your mouth. I went to matsuzakagyu, if you are a big eater 10000 yen won't fill you up unless you eat it with rice.  Lastly if you are a yelp person from the states take trip advisors recommendations with a grain if salt. Their number one rated place was a pizza place. Holy shit why is it a pizza place in Osaka.  My best experiences was eating Katsu and curry in my first day in the Rain my first japan meal. It was a small 15 seat shop with a chef and 2 helpers which were probably related to him. I bit into the Katsu and it has the best texture and pork not overlooked. I thought of a place I could compare it to in Los Angeles and I couldn't and if I did I would have to travel an hour to get there. Later on the trip I went to wako and katsukura which are popular places. The mom and pop shop held it's own.  Cheers"

There are machines for that as well, but I thought the coin system was easy enough."

The JR SUICA, ICOCA, etc works with other systems (i.e Tokyu, Odakyu, Hanshin, Nankai, etc) with some exceptions (mostly private rail lines).  Day pass can be bought at machines at the stations. Like in Kyoto, there are green machines which dispenses day pass for the bus. Though now the bus can accept SUICA, etc nowadays.   And lastly any other things I should know about getting around on local transit?   Rush hour! You might want to experience it ... or not. Your choice."
JapanTravel,3a3s09,TipToeingWorld,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"1 day pass in Tokyo works for Tokyo Metro, costs 1,000 yen. I'd suggest you plan well where to go before buying 1 day pass. If you only go to 2-3 places in a day, single ticket may be cheaper. Short distance metro (like shibuya to harajuku) costs only 170 Yen.  Ticket vending machine is available in station.

Serving sizes usually are just ""regular"" and ""large"", and occasionally ""extra large"". A common thing that's done is to tell the chef to put in fewer noodles. Outside of family-oriented restaurants that happen to have ramen, you're not going to find ""kid size"" servings."

JapanTravel,3a1yje,Aldotroid,4,Wed Jun 17 15:39:30 2015 UTC,"First, make sure you are in a ramen shop. Saw a couple of tourists 3-4 years ago in a restaurant in Shibuya who ordered Okinawa soba. Their faces look deflated, uninspired by the food that was served to them. One minute they were there, the next moment they were not there anymore. Their bowls un-eaten. My thinking that time was they thought it was ramen and was dismayed to see this ""soba"" in front of them.   No need to finish off everything. It's more polite than throwing up on the shop floor because you finished off everything ... but failed holding everything in your stomach. When I can't finish my ramen, I give a sigh and say ""give up"" with my hands in the air. :-)  Slurping is OK ... because it is a good way to cool off the noodles before it hits the inside of your mouth.   ""Kids serving"" varies. Some store chains have them, Ramen Kagetsu Arashi (らあめん花月嵐) has a 280 yen (!) okosama set. I think its really only for kids.  Some shops will have vending machines, where you buy a ticket and give that at the counter/wait staff. These will tend to have the ""oomori"" large serving printed in one of the buttons. Some shops will not have ""large"" servings instead you will have to order ""kaedama"" after you finish your ""men"" noodles. Make sure you didn't finish off the soup though, kaedama is JUST noodles.  Enjoy the meal and say ""gochisousama deshita"" afterwards, to the cook and the wait staff."

Edit:  Here's a hint: Delta 'Shuttle' flight this Friday from LaGuardia to DC-Reagan (215mi) is US$630 one way and SFO to LAX (338mi) this weekend is US$440 one way.

JapanTravel,3a4o9l,rainbow_city,0,Wed Jun 17 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that Narita is a pain. I guess it's more perspective though. From where I live, Fukuoka, it isn't even a question to use use air or shinkansen. The Fukuoka airport is right in the city, less than 2km from the shinkansen station. And, shinkansen-ing to Osaka or Tokyo is three times the price as LCC."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,otsukarekun,4,Wed Jun 17 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"ut if you wait a single day, Peach Airlines on Saturday is ¥6,790 + ¥3,020 for N'EX, or US$79.41.   Yes, and in the 7 hours since you posted, the price now starts at ¥8,390.   You also forgot to mention that NRT->KIX is a 90 minute flight, and you have to take an hour-plus train ride out to Narita, and then ANOTHER hour train ride from KIX into Osaka, where the Shinkansen takes you right from Shinagawa (or Tokyo) to Shin-Osaka Station, which is literally a 3 minute train ride away from Osaka/Umeda Station. And that train ride is a total of 2 hours 15 minutes.  Generally the Japanese will ride the train if it's less than 4 hours, and fly for anything longer than 4 hours. Tokyo to Osaka? take the train. Tokyo to Fukuoka? Fly."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,geekpondering,0,Wed Jun 17 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"But the question is whether or not the shinkansen is expensive, not which is convenient. More anecdotal evidence, I know people who regularly take a highway bus on weekends to go back to their home towns. They spend 3 hours on the bus rather than an hour on a shinkansen to save money. I hate bringing up more anecdotal evidence, but the only time I hear people using a shinkansen is when their company pays, or for trips 2 hours away and less. The shinkansen is by far the most convenient way to travel, but that doesn't mean it isn't expensive."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,otsukarekun,3,Thu Jun 18 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"But the question is whether or not the shinkansen is expensive, not which is convenient.    Oh for pete's sake. You can only determine whether something is ""expensive"" by making cost/benefit analyses against other modes of transportation. Is Shinkansen more convenient? Does it take less time?    More anecdotal evidence, I know people who regularly take a highway bus on weekends to go back to their home towns.    I'm not sure what this is evidence of. People are trading cost for comfort and (in the case of overnight buses) quality of sleep.  To take this to the ridiculous extreme: Walking is free. Does that make all other modes of transportation too expensive?"
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,geekpondering,0,Thu Jun 18 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"This is going no where, and neither of us will convince each other. But I think my point is got muddied.     All I am saying, is that a shinkansen is not cheap; it's one of the most expensive reasonable modes of public transportation (only surpassed by non-LCC air). From a non-Tokyo-centric, graduate school student budget point of view, taking the shinkansen isn't the norm or default method of travelling. It's great for foreign travelers, businessmen, spontaneous 2-day away trips, and whatnot, but it's also not the first choice for many people living in Japan, which is what the OP was asking about."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,otsukarekun,2,Thu Jun 18 05:42:25 2015 UTC,"All I am saying, is that a shinkansen is not cheap; it's one of the most expensive reasonable modes of public transportation (only surpassed by non-LCC air).   I'm not saying it's cheap. I'm saying it's cheap for what you get. With any mode of transport, there's a trade off between price and convenience, time, and comfort.   For ~2 hour or less Shinkansen trips:   Taking an express train or a bus might be cheaper than Shinkansen, but it's going to be slower and less comfortable.  Taking any plane might be somewhat cheaper than Shinkansen, but you have to book way ahead, and generally you are going to have to go a lot farther to get to airport(s).    From a non-Tokyo-centric   What percentage of the Japanese population lives in Kanto, Kansai, or the corridor between? It's easily over half.   graduate school student budget point of view   Well, sure. Again, people not willing to pay money to save time and convenience aren't going to spring for ANY mode of transport that's more expensive. When I'd travel from SF to LA, I'd usually drive because it made more sense for me to save a few hundred bucks on the flight cost and rental car by driving 7 hours than the flight (~1 hr) plus wait plus rental car hassle, which would end up being 3 or 4 hours.   taking the shinkansen isn't the norm or default method of travelling.   I don't think anyone said it was. The OP had the following questions:   If the Shinkansen is so pricey, for whom is the service designed? And why do Shinkansen tickets cost as much as they do?   And the answer is, compared to other regional services worldwide (European bullet trains, US ""shuttle"" plane flights, etc) it's not 'pricey'. Period."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,geekpondering,2,Thu Jun 18 06:32:47 2015 UTC,The Tokaido shinkansen is the only profitable high speed rail route in the world.   It's expensive because it's the best way to travel between cities. It's competition is airplanes.   Everybody uses them from families on trips to business men. The low end travel market is served by buses.

JapanTravel,3a4o9l,its_real_I_swear,2,Wed Jun 17 07:14:12 2015 UTC,"Apart from what people have said in this thread already, in Japan, people are paid for their daily commute by their work, whether it's a single local train or Shinkansen to a local city. That's what made the Shinkansen possible in the first place, neighbouring cities suddenly become commutable."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,talsit,5,Wed Jun 17 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"This leads to the other point of most people using the Shinkansen are doing it for sorter trips. Few people will ride across the entire country on one because after a certain distance the planes are cheaper and faster. But for shorter trips the Shinkansen saves a lot of time and most passengers are using it for this.   Shinkansen tickets cost roughly the same as the highway tolls for the same distance, so traveling alone by Shinkansen is a better option than driving. Buses are cheaper but much slower so if you are in a hurry they aren't a good option.   Now there are cheap flights available, but unless I live close to Narita (for the Tokyo area) they aren't that convenient and the Shinkansen is a more desirable option.   For example if I live in Yokohama it's much more convenient and not that much more expensive to Shinkansen to Kyoto or Osaka vs a LCC. Now if I live in Narita you can bet the plane is the better option.   If I'm not in a hurry I'll usually take a bus to my destination, but often I'll just pay the extra money for the convenience of the Shinkansen."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,kaseijin64,2,Wed Jun 17 07:19:28 2015 UTC,"Also, Shinkansen is super convenient. They run every, what, 5-10 minutes, you can literally walk up to a non-reserved seat and get on it, no queuing, no lines, no security, just hop-on, hop-off..."
JapanTravel,3a4o9l,talsit,-2,Wed Jun 17 08:09:05 2015 UTC,"Because high-speed standard gauge, continuous welded rails are expensive to maintain, also, until recently with the rise of LCCs, the shinkansen cost the same as a plane did, so it didn't seem so expensive.   Edited for better to reflect accuracy and not a dumb joke..."

JapanTravel,3a0t9d,tojikomori,3,Tue Jun 16 09:52:31 2015 UTC,"Will you be taking the Narita Express back to the airport? Will you be traveling around Tokyo? You can rack up a lot of costs around the cities if you are sightseeing.   However, if you're sightseeing in Kyoto you'll probably be using the bus more and I would recommend getting a 1 day bus pass for 500 yen (I think) each day.   However, I second /u/vagabond_Sam. The JR pass is really annoying in busy stations. It's much more convenient to get a TOICA/SUICA card when you arrive, put money on it and use it around the cities. (Plus it works on subways, the JR, and other railways that the JR pass doesn't work on. However, it doesn't work on the Shinkansen and you'll have to buy those tickets separately)."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,thefullminator,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:23:18 2015 UTC,"I was planning on using the Narita Express both ways, but someone else mentioned the Skyliner being cheaper/easier, so I'll look into that option too. Any other ideas are also welcome, though!  I have a couple of questions about the Suica option:   I've heard that IC Cards are now broadly interchangeable. Does this apply to recharging them as well as using them? i.e., if I use up my Suica in Kyoto will I be able to recharge it at a station there or will I have to replace it with Pitapa or somesuch? How quick/easy is it to buy Shinkansen tickets individually? Can I expect English language machines/service at Kanazawa as well as Kyoto and Tokyo?   Thanks!"
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,chazchaz101,2,Tue Jun 16 12:59:57 2015 UTC,You can recharge the cards anywhere that you can use them.   I believe all shinkansen ticket machines have an English mode.
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,thefullminator,2,Tue Jun 16 14:29:14 2015 UTC,Everywhere I have been has accepted a wide variety of IC cards. I have SUICA and have always been able to use it. (Also it has a cute penguin on it so that's a plus). You should be able to fill it on any machine. Sometimes when you're journey starts in one IC card region and your destination is in another region you cannot simply go through the station gates. The card is accepted but an attendant must do it.   I've never seen a Shinkansen machine that doesn't have an English option. They are pretty straight forward to use. They ask pretty simple questions and there's clear options. (It can be tricky buying the ticket if you are transferring from a JR line to the Shinkansen if you don't exit the JR gates with your IC card). I think all train machines I have seen besides a few in some very old stations in a rural area have an English option. The English signage is pretty extensive in Japan in train stations. You shouldn't have a problem with that.    P.S. Also IC cards should work on bus systems also.
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,david_131,2,Tue Jun 16 15:39:22 2015 UTC,What date do you fly home and from which airport? Are you in Tokyo sightseeing from July 2 to July 4? Are you spending 2-4 hours in Shirakawago on the way between Takayama and Kanazawa?
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,david_131,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:19:30 2015 UTC,"Flying home Jul 16 from Narita. A little sightseeing in that time (our hotel for that short stay is right by Tsukiji Market, for example) but the majority of our Tokyo sightseeing will be Jul 13-15. I was thinking we'd take a look around Hida Minzoku Mura Folk Village while we're in Takayama and then skip Shirakawago.   Sorry for the delayed response BTW. I posted my reply in the other thread and immediately realized it was coming up for 5 AM and I hadn't slept yet. Whoops."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,david_131,2,Tue Jun 16 12:40:43 2015 UTC,"Have you booked all your accommodation? Are you plans relatively set?    I'd probably just get a 14-day JR Pass. Depending on what time you arrive on July 2 I would probably consider setting activation date as July 3 so you are covered on July 16 to get back to Narita via Narita Express. What do you plan on seeing in Uji? I would take the trains from Takayama to Toyama to Kanazawa instead of taking the bus. Trains are fully covered by your JR Pass, whereas the bus is not.    If you are on a tighter budget then there are some other options of course including buses."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,david_131,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for your advice. Our flights and accommodation are all booked, and until I started poking about online to see what others said, I'd assumed I'd just get the 14 day JR Pass. Now of course I'm having trouble deciding!  I've saved up enough for this trip that unless there's a dramatic price difference between JR Pass vs. no JR Pass, budget is a secondary concern for me: ease and convenience come first. It's starting to sound like it may actually be slightly less convenient to use a JR Pass vs. buying individual tickets. I'm hearing that Suica works nationwide for standard JR travel and most buses, and when it comes to shinkansen automatic ticket machines are widely available with English language user interfaces. By comparison, reserving shinkansen seats with the JR Pass means I would have to approach staff each time.  I'm a little worried that people are overestimating the availability or overstating the ease of the machines, but I'd definitely love to hear your thoughts if you've traveled with and without a JR Pass.  Ah, and the Uji thing! Actually: neither of those daytrips from Kyoto are set in stone. I wanted to see Byodo-in, but the idea behind Uji was mostly that it might be a nice break from the crowds: a chance to try some of that famous Uji tea in the town itself, and check out the local scenery. The Tale of Genji connection is a bit of a pull, too."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,its_real_I_swear,2,Wed Jun 17 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"I have used JR Pass or no JR Pass multiple times, sometimes on the same trip. I'd get a 14-day JR Pass. They are easy to use. Once you get used to using them there is not much difference in terms of speed compared to a Suica/IC card. They are definitely more convenient in terms of flexibility as you can change your plans or do different day trips or even backtrack easily if required. Making seat reservations for the Shinkansen is pretty easy with the JR Pass especially for your trips. In general if I am worried I just write down the departure and arrival stations and include a date and if I know it a time. For most of yours you can probably make the reservations easily enough the day before or even 30 mins before departure time if you wish. I tend to plan ahead though for obvious departure times (like most of yours look like they will be). If you are really worried about it you could make all of your seat reservations for the entire trip at once when you first arrive either at Narita or maybe at a larger station in Tokyo like Tokyo Station where you are more likely to encounter staff that can speak some English.    Sounds like you should keep your Uji trip. You just don't have a lot of time in Kyoto itself, maybe 1.5 or 2 days by the looks of it.    Looking at your itinerary I would recommend you consider a day trip to Nagoya from Tokyo for the Sumo Tournament (July 12-26) http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2080.html http://www.buysumotickets.com/ http://www.sumo.or.jp/en/ Obviously this would be covered by your JR Pass if you have one. In general I suggest you arrive at the Sumo somewhere between 1pm and 2:30pm and then it finishes at 6pm."

Should have flown back home from Kanazawa   Ugh, I know! Definitely a lesson learned the hard way.

JapanTravel,3a0t9d,AstroRae,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of inclined to shrug my shoulders and just do it so I can stand in line and slink through the gate for each trip instead of having to sort a fare out.   It's less effort buying a ticket at the automatic station machines and waltzing through the gate then getting your JR pass out, your passport out, getting the persons attention, have them throughly check it, and then wave you through.  Also, some trains have reservations required so you go to the ticket station on top of all that as well.  Unless your clearing break even, the flexibility of no pass is better and more convenient as you don;t have to worry about sevrices not covered by JR.  Also often there are N'EX specials on the ground when you arrive where it's half price for foreigners so you may even save more money."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,Vagabond_Sam,2,Tue Jun 16 10:20:40 2015 UTC,As if they really check it at the ticket gates... they see the pass from distance and wave you through. No passport
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,AstroRae,3,Tue Jun 16 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"This was my experience. I honestly considered Gaijing Smashing and using my JR Pass for an extra 8th day just because not ONCE did anyone ever ask to see my passport or even open the JR Pass. It could have been a year old for all they knew. Not at any stations throughout Kyoto, Osaka, or Tokyo. They just waved us right through. It was actually easier than just tap tap tapping my Suica."
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:52:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Not having to produce my passport makes some difference.  I have a question about using the JR Pass for shinkansen travel. Judging from this video I'd need to approach a ticket officer to request a shinkansen ticket using a JR Pass; I wouldn't be able to waltz through the gate like a regular JR train.  Is that true?
JapanTravel,3a0t9d,Gurtang,2,Tue Jun 16 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"If you want a reserved seat you need to go to a Midori no Madoguchi office in a jr station and have them make the reservation for you.   You can definitely just waltz into a Shinkansen, but you have to go to the free seating car, not a reserved seat car. Basically you run the risk of not having a seat and having to stand the entire train ride."

The buses are crowded and slow. Taxi's can enter the bamboo forest in Arashiyama btw.   You can rent a wheel chair at USJ if you wish. 500yen for regular and 3000yen for electronic.

JapanTravel,3a0ua1,Tukoruko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:05:48 2015 UTC,"1) A rainy day in September is like a rainy day anywhere else. Usually just buy an umbrella/raincoat and you'd be fine.  2) How bad it is usually depends on which part of the country you're in when it hits. Okinawa and Kyushu are usually the worst affected, and the typhoon loses strength as it moves inland.The Kansai and Kanto regions will still get some shitty weather though. The main effects are super-strong winds and horizontal rain.  Airports are closed, trains are usually stopped, and roads might be flooded (depending on the city). Usually lasts a day, give or take, depending on the speed/size. The next day has superb weather though.  3) Early September is still burning hot. Late September would be slightly more bearable."

JapanTravel,3a0ua1,tougarashi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:30:07 2015 UTC,I was in Japan from 1-21 September last year and it was raining whole first day. After that there was two more day when it rain. But I think I was just lucky because it was always raining somewhere else and we just moved from one place to another.  It was that hot but it was quite humid so even 25 felt quite sweaty.
JapanTravel,3a0ua1,nou_spiro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about the weather in September! If anything, you're more likely to melt than to be blown away. Bring an umbrella and you most likely won't have any heavy typhoons or storms to deal with."
JapanTravel,3a0ua1,JapanWifiBuddy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"1) Rain isn't too bad in September.  June is the notorious month for rain.  2) Typhoon season is an experience if you haven't been on one before.  You will have some train delays and extremely strong winds, which I find exhilarating :)  3) Late September if you want to avoid any heat."

JapanTravel,3a0owl,Ivytiu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:15:34 2015 UTC,"Cold but rarely below freezing during the day. Find a good hotel, hostel, minshuku at night. Headwinds or tailwinds are all part of the game. Get a good map, i.e. Mapple. Or make sure your GPS is working correctly.  Do you have a route already?   Shikoku can be hilly, but the coastal road around the island is relatively flat. You'll have to ferry from Shikoku to Hiroshima or maybe Osaka. Or use the Shimanami-kaido route from Imabari (in Shikoku) to Onomichi in Hiroshima. It'll cross the Seto inland sea via land bridges and islands. 60km only from Imabari. From Onomichi is a grey area to me. From Osaka you can take Route 1 to Tokyo. It is a boring highway. You ride with cars, but you won't get lost! (I have not personally tried this route though)"

If so, you are probably too late to buy a JR Rail Pass. You need to purchase it from an agency outside of Japan.     If you are just talking about regular shinkansen tickets, you can buy them from the ticket offices at the stations. You are safe to buy them day of.        What would be a realistic time to arrive at the Osaka hotel in Shinsaibashi      I would say 9:00pm plus or minus an hour.      Your schedule looks line.

JapanTravel,3a0cko,saroka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:15:33 2015 UTC,June 21 activities can be done in day time if you start early (at or 10am) then explore Dotonbori and random neighbourhood in an entire evening.  I'd suggest to include Omotesando and Harajuku too on 29th since they are close to Shibuya.   Tokyo disney sea requires entire day unless you are more interested in taking pictures than having fun. It takes more than 2 hours to get into one attraction even if you have a fast pass.

JapanTravel,39zceg,chazchaz101,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"Also, I would probably split things 3/2 or 2/3 Tokyo and Kyoto, unless there's some specific event that you're attending in Kyoto."
JapanTravel,39zceg,chazchaz101,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:30:17 2015 UTC,Have you ridden the buses there? Can I ask your experience with them?
JapanTravel,39zceg,chazchaz101,2,Tue Jun 16 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Sure. They're not horrible, but also not very comfortable, especially for someone 6 feet tall, and they're not especially dark or quiet either. I rode one from Nagoya to Tokyo, which is about 5 hours, and I wasn't able to sleep much, so I was tired the next day.  Most of them have a toilet on board, and they will usually make several rest stops where you can get off and probably buy some food from a convenience store."
JapanTravel,39zceg,david_131,2,Tue Jun 16 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"I would definitely take the Shinkansen train. I view it as part of the experience of being in Japan, and for your journey I think it is worthwhile.    If you are on a budget then you can consider an overnight bus. This will save you on transport as well as accomodation for the night. In general the buses are clean etc. You may wish to check a site like Willer Express which will give you an idea of the price and configuration of a variety of buses:- http://www.willerexpress.com/    Another option if you don't want to go overnight bus is to use a flight from an LCC like Peach or Jetstar Japan. Often around the 5,000 yen mark but then you have to get from Kyoto to Kansai Airport and from Narita into Tokyo. Not too bad as you can do Kyoto to Kansai Airport for around 1,000 yen and Narita to Tokyo for around 1,000 yen if you wish.     There are some discount Shinkansen tickets like Puratto Kodama but these use the slower Kodama Shinkansen which stop at many more stations (around 4 hours vs 2.5 hours). I wouldn't really recommend this but it may be an option for you. http://www.jrtours.co.jp/kodama/en/    Kyoto to Tokyo access:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2363.html    I assume you arrive at Kansai Airport so would recommend the ICOCA + Haruka package to get you from the airport to Kyoto:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_icoca_haruka.html"
JapanTravel,39zceg,otsukarekun,2,Tue Jun 16 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"Split the difference and take an airplane. You can get a cheap flight from Narita to Osaka for 5,000 to 6,000 yen from Peach, Jetstar, or a different LC airline. It's faster than a shinkansen and only a little more expensive than a bus."
JapanTravel,39zceg,david_131,2,Tue Jun 16 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with your suggestion, just note that it is significantly longer than using a Shinkansen. Kyoto - KIX is 80 mins (Haruka), NRT - Tokyo is around 60+ mins if you are saving money. Even those two are about the same time as the Nozomi Shinkansen from Kyoto Station to Tokyo Station (140min). Add on 15 minutes before check in, flight time (80 mins), disembarkation, possible luggage collection, waiting for the train at Narita, etc. and total travel time using the LCCs will be significantly longer."
JapanTravel,39zceg,sessyargc_jp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:15:20 2015 UTC,I like your thinking sir
JapanTravel,39zceg,kaseijin64,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"So do you arrive and depart from Narita?  The JR pass will allow you to use the shinkansen (except for the Nozomi class). I think it is worth it specially if you'll be using the JR trains for your local travels. The savings add up.  Several years back, I took the JR highway bus from Shinjuku - Sannomiya (Kobe). For comparison this is a bit further than Kyoto - Tokyo route. Clean yes. Rest stops not really, the bus has a toilet at the back! You can bring your own snacks. Seating is 2x2. Cramped ... ahhh yes ... and I'm already a small person! If you can put up with that, it is a very cheap option. Some bus companies cater to foreigners (i.e. Willer) quite well (i.e more leg room, English website)."
JapanTravel,39zceg,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm flying in to Kansai and departing from Narita. I prefer to just pick one city to explore instead of seeing as much as I can in a short amount of time, so I'll be spending the majority of my week in Kyoto before going to up to Tokyo to see some friends and then fly out. I looked at the JR pass but I couldn't justify the cost for just one train ride.   Holy cow those are some fancy buses! Now I'm really torn."

Harajuku: Depends on where you're traveling from, but probably yes. Roppongi: No.   You can't use the pass on subways and private lines, which are prevalent in major city areas.

JapanTravel,39zmbv,charade_scandal,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:00:43 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmm. Maybe skipping the two nights in Yokohama and switching that up to Kanazawa then using the 21st and 22nd for Osaka. Osaka to Nagoya would be easy for the next leg. Kind of sucky to have the long Tokyo to Osaka journey but I mean, three hrs or whatever will not kill me.  I can then lose the 26th in Osaka and head to Hiroshima letting me come back for the final Tokyo show...."
JapanTravel,39zmbv,david_131,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:18:55 2015 UTC,"Are your flights booked? Can you move all your Tokyo time to the end and stay after the band leaves? Seems to make more sense to me. Do you really need all those days in Tokyo? I assume you plan on chilling with the band at the end?     Might be easier to look at your itinerary if you include the day of the week next to each date?    You might find it easier to separately list the band nights you want to attend and work on it from there.     What time does the Nagoya show finish? Could you see the Nagoya show from Kyoto and use Kyoto as a base for a couple of nights?   You have a lot of time in Tokyo so two nights in Yokohama seems fine to me.    Have you been to Matsumoto before? You may even want to use Matsumoto as a base (instead of Nagano) for a couple of days and do the show, a day trip for the Snow Monkeys, and then either explore Matsumoto or perhaps Nagano if you wish. Nagano to Matsumoto is not too far and you can take the Ltd Exp.    Kanazawa is a pretty cool city and I think you will enjoy it there. Certainly enough to see in two days.    What sort of budget are you on? Do you plan on using a JR Pass? Would a 21-day JR Pass and a zigzag itinerary work for you?    I think I would be inclined to place your non-band travel first and then essentially follow the band around for the 10 days they are there. ie. do Kanazawa, Hiroshima, first before band. Maybe spend time between show on 20th and show on 24th in Matsumoto/Nagano, use Kyoto as a base for Nagoya show and then end up in Tokyo.    As you mention, it really depends on your priorities."
JapanTravel,39zmbv,david_131,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"I think you nailed it.  For what it's worth, it would have made more sense to fly over with the band as we're leaving from the same city, do the shows/hangs with them (whatever format I picked) and then just given myself a full 10-12 days AT THE END to do whatever I wanted.  I think I was fixated on getting there as soon as I could (I love Japan) and for some reason thinking I needed to settle in or whatever before they arrived.  As it stands I've probably set myself up for three separate Tokyo stays.   I'm looking forward to Kanazawa! Whatever I end up doing I'll make sure that I go there for sure.  At this point I grabbed my ticket during a seat-sale and it would cost a couple hundred to switch the dates. But a lot of your points make sense and I'm going to try and work with them as much as I can.  Regarding Nagoya, I have only been there once in 2008 and have picked two nights there as it I would technically count it as a 'never been to' city since it was so long ago and frankly, I had no clue what I was doing. Going there would be like spending two days in a new city. I have been thinking if there was a way to get an extra night in Kyoto but at the same time I was just there last year and obviously love it but think if there is a one-night stay in a city, I could live with it being Kyoto.  Overall, looking at what I'll set out I'll probably just bite the bullet and get the three week JR pass. Thought I would try the 14 day one but my loose estimates of having a couple journeys pre-activation I don't know if the savings would be that great.  Thanks for your fresh set of eyes and I'll probably post later on with a more detailed plan once I've started booking things.  It's funny, everytime I go I say 'alright, limit the amount of train travel' and I always come up with a backwards plan and find myself dragging my suitcase to another JR station. But hey, I love it."
JapanTravel,39zmbv,david_131,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"Good to hear! I don't think it is essential to change your flights, but like you say it may be easier to do your non-band travel first, then head back to Tokyo and follow the band. Two nights in Nagoya seems fine also. Yes, I would just get a 21-day JR Pass but maybe it is worth revising your itinerary and then checking from there."
JapanTravel,39zmbv,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Regarding Matsumoto, would you recommend it over Nagano for a two-night stay?  I must confess I only am more familiar with Nagano simply because of the Olympics.  If I can get to the monkey island easy from either city then I'm fluid on where I spend the night."
JapanTravel,39zmbv,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes too much difference as they are only 50 mins apart. I just guessed because the band is going there, and Matsumoto Castle is worth seeing, that it may give you a better option for seeing the band there rather than another city perhaps. Access to the snow monkeys is fine from Matsumoto. I would chat to the friendly staff at the Nagano Tourist Office when you arrive in Nagano but basically I'd just get the Snow Monkey Pass and take the buses as explained here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6027.html?aFROM=6000_6025    Just check with the Tourist Office on bus timetables and where to buy the pass as it is a little awkward as you buy the pass on one side of the station but the buses leave from the other side of the station."

JapanTravel,39w9dn,naephil,3,Mon Jun 15 08:51:02 2015 UTC,"Seems you'll have enough time. With some slack, it takes at most 1h to get off the plane, go through immigration and grab your luggage. Then 7 minutes to domestic terminal (make it 30 minutes with, once again, a bit of slack). Even with that, you still have 45 minutes to register your luggage and go through security, which is more than enough (ANA asks you get 15 minutes ahead of time)."
JapanTravel,39w9dn,Titibu,2,Mon Jun 15 09:03:41 2015 UTC,"You're cutting it close. It can take longer than an hour to get through immigration if you're not lucky, and then you have to get your luggage and go through customs and then clear security again   If you don't have luggage you're probably ok, but luggage would make it dangerous, as they stop accepting luggage a certain amount of time before the plane leaves"

JapanTravel,39w9dn,chazchaz101,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:03:56 2015 UTC,To be honest this is really risky. What happens if your flight to Haneda is delayed? Since you booked your tickets separately you'd likely be out of luck if you missed your Sapporo flight at 14:30 and would have to purchase another ticket.  I've taken the risk before (booking two separate tickets on the same day) and have gotten so close to nearly missing the 2nd flight due to the delay of the 1st. Not worth the stress IMO.

Providing that no delay occur, the time between your international flight arrival and ANA  departure flight is enough.  Should you have any further question, please contact us again.

JapanTravel,39yh58,noumenonandon,4,Mon Jun 15 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"Check hyperdia for prices. Generally, I think the 7 day pass pays off for a round trip between Tokyo and Kyoto. If you are flying out of Osaka though, not sure if it's a smart decision..but again, just check hyperdia, they have all the prices written there and the search layout is pretty simple."
JapanTravel,39yh58,adam_364,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Without the round trip it will most likely be cheaper without the JR pass. I'd almost argue that sometimes it's less convenient to have a JR pass because the manned stations can get bottle-necked sometimes (and they barely glance at it, anyway). The Suica/Pasmo readers are always quick/easy."
JapanTravel,39yh58,serintide,2,Mon Jun 15 21:52:44 2015 UTC,A (national) JR Pass won't come close to paying off so I would definitely not get one.    I would buy a Suica when you arrive in Tokyo and use that to pay for most of your transport within the cities. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html    If you were on a really tight budget you could return the Suica when you leave Tokyo and buy an ICOCA once you get to Kansai but I'd just keep the Suica. Just note you can't return the Suica at Kansai Airport so you miss out on the 500 yen refund. Save the Suica for another trip or give it to a friend going to Japan in the future perhaps.    If you decide to do a longer day trip from Kyoto and don't use a car then there are a few local passes that can be useful. Even if you wanted to go as far away as Hiroshima/Miyajima there are passes to suit. Note that for most of these regional ones you can just buy them in Japan. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html    I'd consider a day trip or half-day trip to Himeji Castle from either Kyoto or Osaka. If you do decide on this then a JR West Kansai Area One Day Pass (2200 yen) will pay off. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_03.html

Although the cards are now relatively interchangeable from a usage point of view (although not exactly) refunds can only be done at the relevant operator. So ICOCA can be refunded at JR West, Suica can be refunded at JR East.    More details here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html"

That's was a gorgeous Ryokan in Izu-Kogen that had private hot springs bath that really caught my eye which is why I chose that place but a 3 hours detour just for it does seem a bit much considering all the train traveling we're already doing. It didn't seem to bad at first when I was calculating a couple hours here and there, it really does add up. The main points of the trip is Tokyo, the festivals and our last day had to end in fukuoka because of the ferry that will take us to Korea. The reason I choose Kyoto and Nara was because it was along the way down and it would break the train travel time so it would not be all one . I would like to forget about the ferry all the way down in Fukuoka to Korea and take a flight over but my friend wants to take the ferry thinking it would be a nice experience. Perhaps it'll be a better idea to convince her otherwise though."

The Ginkakuji Temple or the Silver Temple is pretty too, so I suggest walking the Philosophers Walk to arrive there. To be honest, you'll struggle to go many places without stumbling across a temple or a shrine in Kyoto.  In Osaka, if you fancy getting out of the city centre head to Osaka Castle, it's not far on the underground. The grounds are pretty extensive so if you don't want to pay to go round there are still plenty of places to see there, including a shrine. The Tenmangu Shrine in Osaka has a lot of shopping opportunities attached to it. Osaka is great to explore at night, the area which Dotonbori is in is super fun."

JapanTravel,39v2iv,rainbow_city,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh. I thought the Shinkansen was expensive, and workers who work in Tokyo generally live around Tokyo to avoid those pricey Shinkansen tickets. Plus, many companies have transportation allowances for their employees, and they probably won't splurge on Shinkansen but only cover JR/private surface lines. And again, once you hit Tochigi, Gunma, Ibaraki, Yamanashi or Shizuoka prefectures, commuting to Tokyo on surface lines is torture."
JapanTravel,39v2iv,49nutters,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"Also, that's still $780 US per month just for commuting.   Using the surface lines (which takes two hours), a 3 month commuter ticket is still $400 US per month.  I'd just move to Akabane."
JapanTravel,39v2iv,rainbow_city,2,Tue Jun 16 07:49:32 2015 UTC,"First of all Japanese people do indeed commute 80 minutes.  But those trains are quite popular. I catch the utsonomiya line or the shonan-shinjuku line from Kuki station 20 minutes north of Omiya and it is often standing room only all the way to Tokyo. This isn't germain to your question, but the Tobu Line station I live nearis about 90 minutes from Tokyo (45 minutes north of Omiya) and it's standing room only during commutes. And during normal times becomes standing room maybe 4 or 5 stops south.  But you're asking the wrong question. The utsonomiya/takasaki lines already existed. There are just through trains now. Frequency hasn't increased on the northbound lines.   Also also, trains are part and parcel of Japanese life. Not nearly everyone is going to Tokyo."

What are your interests?    For your middle section I'd consider Tokyo - Kanazawa - Shirakawago - Takayama - Kyoto. Alternatively, I would include Hiroshima, Miyajima, and maybe Okayama, or Okunoshima, or Onomichi perhaps. You could also consider a night in a temple in Koyasan if you think that would interest you. You may also like to consider a day trip to Nara if you didn't do that last time.

Most restaurants that have tatami-style seating also have other types of seating too.

JapanTravel,39rv96,Devar0,3,Sun Jun 14 10:13:30 2015 UTC,"You will completing the hardest part of the ascent at the coldest time of night and with the least visibility. As its during climbing season you likely won't be alone though. Take your time, make sure you have a good headlight and rest for a few minutes at each station you come too. If the wind is up it will be cold so carry appropriate layers. The altitude sickness tends to kick in on the way down if you power up in one go so be prepared for the signs. It's generally a little dizziness. The descent from 9th station to the 7th is very rocky and slow going and you have to concentrate or you will slip and death is likely as you will split your head. The rocks are extremely sharp. This is the time to go slow.  All that aside easiest mountain I've hiked. You will be climbing during season so lots of people, huts open, stores open etc. Don't rush and you will be fine."
JapanTravel,39rv96,_mgr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:03:29 2015 UTC,"you have to concentrate or you will slip and death is likely as you will split your head   Well that's encouraging..! We will definitely be taking it slowly and we'll be packing plenty of layers, a headlight and sturdy shoes.   Do you know if the stores are open at night? Would they mind us stopping and sitting around for 10-15 minutes at each station?"
JapanTravel,39rv96,amyranthlovely,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:12:21 2015 UTC,"The rocks down are closer to loose gravel, or scree. You need to control your walking or you will end up almost running down and skidding on loose rocks. If you've skiied ever and you know how to drop to your butt when you feel yourself start to lose control, you should be fine, but the best way to avoid it is take your time on the way down and DON'T be tempted to run. Especially on the Yoshida Trail, it's easy to overshoot a turn on the downslope and roll the rest of the way down the mountain."
JapanTravel,39rv96,_mgr,0,Sun Jun 14 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"You could slip getting off the bus the difference is you will likely sprain an ankle or maybe break a wrist. You slip on the descent in the same way and you very likely will need to carried off the mountain assuming you survive. I definitely don't want to make out its super hard because it's really not. Everything you will read and hear about it blows it so far out of proportion it's a bit of a joke actually. But the dangers there. So yeah, each step with purpose.   What sort of shoes are you taking? I used a pair of Salomon X-Scream trail runners and they were fantastic. Besides a couple of toe bashing incidents and a sharp rock into the side of my foot they offered outstanding grip and breath super well so if they get wet or your feet sweat lots they will dry quickly and stay warm.  You can hang out where ever you want. The huts are great wind breaks just standing outside them."

Didn't seem that dangerous to me, especially on the paths that are meant for walking. Me and a friend thought that it might be faster to just slide down the mountain, so we did a race who would be faster: us, sliding it down (just for a few hundred meters) or the others walking the normal way. Ended up being a tie, but the sliding was much more exhausting"

JapanTravel,39rv96,teachinginspace,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:51:05 2015 UTC,Is a winter jacket really needed? because it'll kinda take up too much space for a one time use kinda thing in july i will be climbing mt fuji on 15th of july and staying the night at a hut
JapanTravel,39rv96,TheSimonToUrGarfunkl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:29:09 2015 UTC,All the pictures I look at seems to have people in Winter Jackets... lol.  I was thinking the same.  It does take a lot of space.  I have an old one I'm willing to toss if need be (or give to the next climber). 0 C is pretty cold for a long period of time.  If your staying in a night hut though... you might not.  as you won't be outside for that whole period.  It still will be cold.  depends on how you feel about going in the winter with just a sweater.
JapanTravel,39qgeb,imupnext,2,Sat Jun 13 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's the cheapest but if I were you, I'd go to a t-mobile store to make the switch with them so that you have the global coverage on your phone. I had to specifically switch from the prepaid to the postpaid plan to accommodate being able to use my phone no problem.  It ended up being $10.00 more per month (I had the $50 prepaid before and switched to $60 post paid) but I think financially, for one or two months it's less expensive to do this.  Just a note, they do make you get a new sim to switch from prepaid to post, so if you go to the store, you may be able to convince them to give you the sim for free instead of charging you $15.00. When in Japan I did not have to get a new sim or anything to be able to use both my data and normal calling.  When you arrive in Japan you'll get some text messages from t-mobile saying that you get unlimited text and data with global coverage but that they charge $0.20/min for talk.   This ended up being very easy for me and I had everything working on my phone immediately after landing.   Edit:  Actually upon re-reading your question I'm not sure this will work.  I have an unlocked phone I purchased on Amazon so I can switch carriers whenever I want so I didn't need any codes when I did this.  If you purchased the phone from T-Mobile it may not work exactly the same?"
JapanTravel,39qgeb,bobbleheadkitty,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"thanks for the tip.  When I got the unlock code, it says in the email as follows:  ==== below is straight from the T-Mobile email =====  Thank you for taking the time to contact T-Mobile. Below you will see the Instructions for unlocking your T-Mobile ZTE device.   Place the Non T-Mobile SIM Card into the device and turn on device. Press the Center select key. The phone will display a screen to enter the unlock code. Enter the unlock code that was provided Press the Center select key.   Warning: If you enter the wrong Device Unlock code multiple times, the device will lock permanently.  ==== end of email ====  So what you're saying is, I should do this before the trip so I'll know it works. I'll ask about it when I go to the T-Mobile store."
JapanTravel,39qgeb,bobbleheadkitty,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they gave you the code without instructions saying to specifically not do this prior to your trip you're probably fine."
JapanTravel,39qgeb,3xlax,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:07:55 2015 UTC,do you have any suggestions on which SIM cards I should get in Japan if I want 4G or close to LTE speeds?
JapanTravel,39qgeb,3xlax,2,Sat Jun 13 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have the free intl roaming with the $30 plan. But you can get it on the T-Mobile network for $33 from harbor mobile.  The only downside is the data will be only 2.5gb per month with harbor mobile.  I had blazing speed in Japan from roaming, the only downside is the you only get 4g(not LTE) in Tokyo, but otherwise capped LTE in Japan"
JapanTravel,39qgeb,devcoder,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"when you say ""blazing speed"", can you give me an idea? like 30Mbps and above in Japan with Harbor Mobile?"
JapanTravel,39qgeb,jamar030303,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"T-mobile says the speed is capped at 3G speed while roaming international. I didn't do speedtest in Japan, but it was more than capable outside Tokyo with LTE connection. As for Tokyo, the 4G connection was spotty, and had to turn data on and off to resume connection few times."
JapanTravel,39qgeb,teachinginspace,2,Sat Jun 13 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"I've been in Japan for the past 3 months with T-Mobile US, they might very well include free roaming data (capped at 192 kbps) in your plan like I have. It's not fast but it works more than well enough for chat, VoIP (with Google Hangouts), and Google Maps."

JapanTravel,39rra9,teachinginspace,5,Sun Jun 14 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"For AirBnB, I assume people use them before check in time, or if they are travelling between cities and make stops on the way.   As for prevalence, coin lockers are staples of train systems the world over, aren't they? When you don't have a car to leave stuff in, it's nice to not have to lug things around all day (shopping bags, sports equipment, etc)."
JapanTravel,39rra9,PlatinumMinatour,3,Sun Jun 14 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"Then you've never traveled anywhere and needed to store your things securely!  (Kidding. Bear with me here.)  It's mostly because while you CAN leave your stuff at your hotel/hostel, lots of people backpack around Asia, and even local people will want to not carry bags, backpacks, and other accoutrements with them as they travel. If you were carrying your backpack around from city to city, having a safe place to lock it up so you only have to carry your wallet and ID would be a welcome respite. I know I was really happy not having to drag all my luggage to Mount Fuji during my first trip. :3"
JapanTravel,39rra9,amyranthlovely,2,Sun Jun 14 03:19:29 2015 UTC,Safety is one reason. Rolling suitcase on the platform of train station or streets is somewhat dangerous (i.e. hitting other pedestrians) as those space is physically tiny. Non-car society.  Everyone use public transportation system in Tokyo. Nobody want to walk around the town with 40kg of bags.
JapanTravel,39rra9,dubiduba,-1,Mon Jun 15 05:42:34 2015 UTC,Well I'm happy that there are coin lockers but I don't think the 'backpack' around asia is the reason they are there.  I'm just thinking in Canada and US.  Not really much here.  I can see it at train stations and stuff but some are just outside buildings... I would think people would bring their stuff to work and those lugging things would most likely not go to coin lockers during their shopping time.  or after shopping they would just go home or somehting instead of leaving it in a coin locker
JapanTravel,39rra9,rainbow_city,4,Sun Jun 14 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"Many people wouldn't be able to just bring stuff to work, also, many people travel hours to go shopping in places like Tokyo and Yokohama, they can't just run home and drop things off before going to do something else.  Hell, my locker department store specifically has refrigerated lockers for people to store things in until they're ready to go home.  Coin lockers have many uses: One, is yes, people who are traveling often leave their luggage in coin lockers, one reason being check-in/check-out times at hotels.  If you arrive early, you can just shove you stuff in a locker until you're ready to go the hotel, or if you check-out and have time before you leave, you leave you things in a locker.  Other uses include, construction workers using them as storage space for their gear.  People who are going to an event after shopping/some other activity and don't want to carry everything with them.  Men who are hiding their porn collection.  People in tiny apartment who don't have enough room have also used them for storing things like textbooks.  Source: Watching a show where they spent multiple episodes traveling around with a man who's job it was to check on expired lockers."

If yes to either of those, and if you want to spend more time in ""real"" Japan rather than doing touristy things, I'd probably limit time in Tokyo/Kyoto and instead go explore the rest of the country.  Maybe something like Nagoya -> Kyoto -> Osaka -> Kobe -> Shikoku (very few Western tourists end up there) -> Kyushu or Hiroshima before flying back to Tokyo and then back to Nagoya for you.  Or you could head to Tottori from Kyoto and then head up the Sea of Japan coast to Niigata, check out Sado island, and head back to Tokyo via Nagano.  Japan is a fairly big and geographically diverse country all things considered, so you're not going to see everything in two weeks, but you can still see a lot :)"

Don't spend too much time in Nagoya if you can, there's not much to do there and you won't get to see much everyday life (I went to uni there). I'd say Osaka is a good place to have fun. I second Shikoku, and would add Hakone for some nice mountain-clean-air if you are wanting an extra place to go to."

Not a lot of places with English menus, etc. We found one place called Funky Chicken that had a blues/Michael Jackson theme to it that was very accomodating and very friendly. Other places we kind of got the look ""Oh great another foreigner."". We've been trying to adhere pretty strictly to how their culture is, but maybe by doing that we just blend in.

JapanTravel,39o3cs,teachinginspace,6,Sat Jun 13 03:48:45 2015 UTC,"July 1 - Akihabara itself is a whole day in itself, if you enjoy pop and anime culture. There are so many second hand stores every couple of steps that you may end up staying there a full day. If you're not into that kind of stuff, then you'll be done in like an hour or so. Shinjuku doesn't have that much to do as it's mostly a business area with tall buildings. I recommend going to the Metropolitan Government building in Shinjuku at night for the Tokyo night view (free).   July 3 - Is there a reason why you're staying in Kyoto? Just wondering. I usually stay in Osaka as there's more to do at night, and then take day trips to Kobe/Kyoto/Nara from there. It's only 30min from Osaka-Kyoto.   July 4 - The popular places to visit in Kyoto is Kinkakuji, Arashiyama area, and Kiyomizudera.   July 5 - There's not that much else to do in Nara.   July 8 - Have you considered Osaka castle and Umeda Sky building? Also make sure you try some okonomiyaki and takoyaki in Osaka, yummy stuff!   July 11 - Ghibli, Shibuya, Harajuku and Ginza is too much for one day.  I recommend splitting it into two days. For Ghibli, I bought my tickets from JTB in the US. Call them and see if they still sell them.  July 13 - I wouldn't do a day trip to Nagoya on this day. I recommend switching it to right before or right after the Kyoto/Osaka days, because Nagoya is in between Tokyo and Osaka. It doesn't make sense to go back and forth (unless that's what you really want to do..)  There's also a Nagoya castle if you're interested. Food wise, Nagoya is known for their miso katsu, if you're interested.   Does the JR pass work in any other cities (local transit [e.g Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya?] The JR pass works for all JR (Japan Rail) lines, and will NOT work for any of the private lines and local lines that are not JR.   Also what time do most things close in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto (or other places)? Most public places (like gardens, parks, shops, department stores, tourist shopping streets) close pretty early compared to the rest of Asia and the US. They usually close around 5 or 6 or 7, and if it's a ""night"" place like Shinsaibashi in Osaka, they close at 9pm. And they are VERY punctual about time, so if they close at 5pm, they will close at 5 on the dot, and they will not hesitate to let you know (politedly) they are closed and you will need to gtfo. S make sure you pay for all your merchandise before they close.   some other must dos in Tokyo? I mentioned Metropolitan Government building earlier. Also there's Tokyo Disney. There's also a ninja themed restaurant somewhere in Tokyo that looks really cool. Tokyo is also home to a lot of michelin star restaurants, look them up if you fancy them. Also Tokyo Skytree, about Y2000/person to go up to the first observatory, another Y1000 to the very top.   What else is there to do in Nagoya? eat miso katsu  Any other interesting things to do in Hiratsuka and Fukuoka (mainly going there for the festivals)? Fukouka is known for their particular style of ramen - the Hakata Ramen. Try a restaurant named ""Ichiran"" (my personally top ramen pick). They have branches all over Japan.   Kobe beef is every bit as delicious as people say it is, but it's not the only Japanese beef that's good. Japanese beef, or ""wagyu"" is pretty much good everywhere in Japan, and hence its high price tag. Do note though, that Kobe beef is not exported to the US (only recently started being exported to Europe, I believe) so authentic Kobe beef is only in Kobe, Japan. If you're worried about going to Kobe just for beef, there's also a very rich culture of coffee shops and desserts like cheesecakes and pastries to browse, since Kobe used to be a busy port where western ships and goods entered Japan."
JapanTravel,39o3cs,wuerworm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"No real reason for Kyoto... We should have picked Osaka I guess... I can still switch, just losing some money ($50).  Is it worth the switch, is there nothing to do in Kyoto in the evening?  If so, where in Osaka should I stay?  Thanks for all the information.  Nagoya was mainly for the Sumo.  I was planning to do it on the Sunday, but forgot to buy tickets and then all the tickets were gone...  So I could try to go day of and buy the general admission or I could go on the Monday when it will be less competition to buy some tickets."
JapanTravel,39o3cs,hk1018,3,Sat Jun 13 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"I just recently returned home from my month stay in Japan. I wish you luck and hope you have a great time!  Does the JR pass work in any other cities (local transit [e.g Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya?  -Yes, just not private and local lines that aren't JR. Which if you're there for tourism shouldn't be a problem. If you haven't looked into it already I recommend a transportation app that tells you which station and where to transfer to, to help you get around. I used NAVITIME for Japan Travel, it's free and is completely in English. This is a must have for trying to easily navigate Japan's Train stations.  Osaka's other sites that I should go to?  -Have you looked into Umeda Sky Building? On my 2 week stay in Osaka I found this place to be really something special. It is about a 10 minute walk from Osaka Station which is placed right in the middle of a large shopping district. Making your way to the top costs 800yen and has a small gift shop at the top also.  The view from the top http://i.imgur.com/ccCs80L.jpg Also if you have the time Osaka Castle is a must see if in the area. It's about a 20 minute train ride from Osaka Station to the station nearest the castle.  Yokohama sites to see   Yohohama has a really easy to navigate subway system that runs throughout the major tourism parts of the city. I highly recommend that if you have the time to see Yokohama's Land Mark Tower. It's the 4th tallest building in Japan equipped with a full shopping center and seaside views.   Hiroshima will that fill a day? (Miyajima and A-Bomb stuff)  -That will easily fill a day as it did for me. I boarded the bullet train in Shin-Osaka at around 9 in the morning at arriving at 10. Miyajima is a really nice island that can consume a very good portion of time well spent. I recommend trying the oysters at the island."

So, as long you don't mind that you won't see things like the parade and dance contests, Friday's great for just walking around and eating and taking pictures of the decorations.

JapanTravel,39o3cj,Trollshak,6,Sat Jun 13 03:48:40 2015 UTC,"TL:DR: Studying in a beautiful place between the sea and the mountains hundreds of miles away on a weekday, even you can sample a weekend in Tokyo.  (throwaway) Yes. my time to shine (I am American back home in the Eastern US). I guess you got into the Akita International University (国際教養大学) Summer Program? I did the same last year, and I have some tips that I (and maybe you) find useful. Of all the places in Japan, this is why Akita is near the top of my list of favorites.  Getting Around Akita  This page lets you find a bus timetable from AIU to Aeon (very popular place to shop/see a film at Toho/play games/eat a meal for AIU students) and to Wada (for JR). If you take the bus to the train station, you don't have to wait for longer than 20 minutes to change from bus to train and vice versa. The Wada train station even has a small library of sorts.  You can also walk from Wada station to AIU (30 to 40 min), as the last train from Akita to Wada gets in after 22:30 at night. One time walking Wada to AIU late at night I saw only one car pass by on the road, and the one stoplight on the way back was off for the night. Walking between Aeon and AIU is not easily possible because that bus there uses the freeway to the airport.  秋田中央交通 link in japanese sells a student book of bus coupons (通学回数乗車券 worth 100x5+50x15+10x5) for 1000 JPY. Just ask the driver. If you want to pay with 回数乗車券, tear off only the value you need as you get off the bus. Although not Suica, this is convenient if you want to get around Akita, as the buses can be more expensive if you want to go beyond the Aeon/Wada area.  On Tuesdays and Sundays (and 20th and 30th days of the month), the special shuttle bus from Aeon Mall Akita to Akita Station East is free (550 or so JPY otherwise). Little wonder why one of the busiest days of the week there is Sunday. Just take the 160 yen bus to Aeon Mall from AIU, and change there for the shuttle to 秋田駅東口. A timetable in Japanese:  Getting to Tokyo from Akita  The Komachi train is not the only option between Tokyo and Akita. As the direct Komachi train is expensive but luxurious, the night bus is another option here.  If you entered on a temporary visitor visa, you can spend a weekend (or two) in Tokyo for 15000 JPY (choose 5 days out of 2 months) or 10000 JPY (3 days out of 2 months). Get a Japan Bus Pass, by Willer Express. Unlike the JR Japan Rail Pass, you can buy it online in Japan, reserve a seat on a bus, and find a printer there and print out the reservation for that one seat. I printed out the reservation in the computer lab near the AIU library (beautiful modern wooden structure) and brought my passport aboard, and that was all that was required to board the bus.  You can even leave Friday night from Akita (according to Willer, depart Akita station 22:00 and arrive Shinjuku 7:55), get in Saturday morning in Tokyo, mess around there, return to Shinjuku Sunday night, and be back to AIU before class begins.   Willer Express shows one bus daily travelling from Shinjuku to Akita prefecture, stopping at Yokote (6:20), Omagari (7:10) and Akita (8:10). In addition, there is a train from Yokote from 6:33 getting into Wada at 7:28. Assuming class starts at 9:00, by changing to an Akita-bound train at Yokote at 6:30, you can still have time to get an (all-paid-for, if on a meal plan!) breakfast and head to class.  Best of all you only used two travel days, Friday and Sunday.  What you can do in Akita  As for Akita itself, there still is a plethora of fun stuff to do while there. I already mentioned イオンモール秋田, the biggest mall in the prefecture, which everyone here says it's fun.  There is also Round 1 (many parts open at least 22 hours a day) which is a 45ish minute walk (or a free shuttle) from Akita station. You can bowl, do karaoke, play arcade or medal games (the medal games at Round 1 are less expensive than at Aeon, and you lose time there easily. Think of medal games as Candy Crush trying but failing miserably to enter /r/outside), and more. There even is an hourly option, like 1200 JPY per hour for unlimited plays in the arcade and elsewhere) and other specials.   The Akita Museum of Art 秋田県立美術館 is in a modern (2012) building steps away from Akita Station West. I like it because inside it has a huge painting that depicts the beauty of traditional Akita life. 310 JPY  Just walking around downtown and strolling through 千秋公園 it is easy to find a place to do homework. When I was in AIU, the instructor for second-semester Japanese usually assigns us 5 pages of work every two or so days. (we didn't even finish Genki 1! To say something about the difficulty of learning Japanese) Finding a favorite spot to sit and do work in is crucial to accomplishing this task.  Get an umbrella (available almost anywhere there is rain) because in June and July in Tohoku, you will be in the middle of 梅雨 season, and every so often it rains hard. I remember in Sendai one Saturday trying to get onto the 仙山線, only to discover it closed for the afternoon. Why? Because it flooded enough to close almost the whole line down. So make sure to plan for the weather.  Last but not least, sample a 50 yen can of ロサンゼルス コーラ in the Komachi common area trying to trounce the leader with a blue shell, and don't get too carried away.  EDIT: タイプミスがありました。  EDIT2: Don't miss the required activities: they are not just for a grade. Sampling きりたんぽ鍋 by Tazawa Lake, and learning about the wildlife of the Sea of Japan, or East Sea, or whatever you call it, at the 男鹿水族館GAO Oga Aquarium feels memorable also to me. I remember also that room in that honey shop in Tazawako (with the London bus in the front; the shopkeeper swears it is really from London) where everything is Winnie the Pooh memorabilia.  EDIT3: reddit formatting wants me to include http:// in the beginning of links to make them show up properly.  EDIT4: The college cafe food at AIU also is delicious (serves mainly western food like sandwiches and bread), but it is outside the scope of the meal plan (less than 800 jpy though for a glass of tomato juice, a sandwich and  breadsticks). It even serves beer, but iirc they card so that under 20s are not served alcohol.  Another good western food place is ピッツァレクルタ in Aeon Mall 3F. Serves better pizza than anywhere in NYC IMO, perhaps because these pizzas have fresh mozzarella and lots of herbs."

JapanTravel,39lepb,znay,2,Fri Jun 12 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"I climbed Mount Fuji, did the overnight thing, made it to the top by sunrise, and you know what?  It was cloudy as hell.  I saw nothing from the top.    It gets ugly from station 7 up, and I would recommend to anyone climbing Mount Fuji to turn back at station 7 and enjoying the rest of your day.  People generally don't ""start at night,"" they start midday and rest for a few hours before getting up and finishing the climb.  I got up, ate breakfast, went to the bus station, got on the bus, kicked around station 5 for a while, ate lunch, and started my climb.  Some people can squeeze in a crater walk.  I don't know your proficiency level, so I can't really comment.  Look at the distances, and compare with your mountain climbing speed.  In the event of an earthquake or eruption, there isn't much you personally can do.  If you can, try to get back to station 5.  If not, there might be a rescue effort, so try to group with other climbers in your situation.  It's a risk you take by visiting an active volcano."
JapanTravel,39lepb,feembly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:38:17 2015 UTC,It's definitely not uncommon to do it starting at 8 or 9 pm.

JapanTravel,39lepb,a2ms,2,Sat Jun 13 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"1) I did the night climbing about 5 years ago. I started from station 5 about 11pm. There is a lot of people going everyday, even during the night, so yes, bring a lantern but it is impossible to not see people in front of you which illuminates the whole path ahead. I got at the top right on time for sunrise.. however it was very cloudy and I couldn't see a thing, so if you do it be sure to check weather conditions or recommended days. After that I eat and slept at the top (they sell food, drinks and souvenirs). Then I send some postcards from the mailbox at the top and head back down.    2) I did is as a ""day trip"" from Tokyo, so I left my bags in a locker in Shinjuku and went to station 5. So that is what I did during the day."
JapanTravel,39lepb,Meganebashi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:59:49 2015 UTC,Hi a2ms. Thanks for sharing your experience! Was the climb still amazing despite not seeing the sunrise? I'll probably check the weather in advance but i guess sometimes it really depends on luck :)
JapanTravel,39lepb,adam_364,2,Sat Jun 13 13:51:01 2015 UTC,1) Is it really worth it to catch the sunrise from mount fuji? I'm afraid of walking out of the whole trip regretting that I missed the sunrise.  That's the only thing worth doing there. A day climb would be really boring.

JapanTravel,39lepb,_mgr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"I did the overnight climb and slept there (it was a public holiday and the last day of the climbing season so it was fucking expensive). I wouldn't really recommend doing the night climb just for the sunrise though. I saw it, it was okay, but nothing particularly worth the climb during the night. The beautiful starry sky, now that was something different (living in a big city, I am used to seeing 1-2 stars/night so that was really nice). In my experience, the climb itself is really the main reason to go to Fuji and if I ever do it again, I'll certainly climb it during the day."
JapanTravel,39lepb,_mgr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:29:17 2015 UTC,Hi adam_364. Im from the city too. Looking up at the beautiful starry sky does sound like a great experience too :) Thanks for sharing!

You'll be climbing a mountain in the dark without sleeping,  3) no idea  4) If it erupts, you'll probably die. There are emergency shelters but that's for show, they don't have air supplies. But Fuji is the most monitored volcano in the world, if it's going to erupt they won't let people on it. In an earthquake, you'll be outside so it shouldn't be too dangerous. Unless there's a landslide or something. That's the danger of going outside."

If not, I'd recommend Shiraho's Friends House, best place I've stayed in Japan. The owner is amazing and the atmosphere there is incredible. As for places you should visit:  The Palm tree grove is pretty nice. Right before it, there's a shop that sells souvenirs and makes fresh juice with fruits and sugar cane juice, really delicious. Pretty close to that place is Crystal Beach (don't know if it's the official name though), perfect for swimming and snorkeling (beware of tides though). Mt. Nosoko is the highest mountain and while climbing it might be a bit exhausting, it's certainly worth it for the amazing view. Other places that I found nice are the Touji grave, the two lighthouses (Hirakubo, which has another pretty nice beach nearby and Uganzaki), Tamatorizaki Viewpoint and Banna Park. The city itself is pretty interesting too, with the Gurena Mall and many shops, restaurants and Izakaya.   I'd also recommend going to other Islands as day trips. I went to Kuroshima, which was really nice although not having much. It's really just a small island with around 200 people and more than 2000 cows living there, where the highest elevation is 17 meters, but it was just so quiet and nice, I really liked it. You can rent a bike and just drive on the streets as you please (in 3 hours there, I think I saw 2 cars or so). There's a nice beach for snorkeling on the West Island and close to the harbor there's another beach where you might see Sea Turtles laying eggs. I also went to Taketomi Island, but it didn't particularly impress me (maybe I was just tired). Iriomote is also supposed to be amazing, but I am only going there this year, so I can't give you any comment on that.  Food wise, you should try Asa Tempura (deep fried seaweed) if you can find it (I still crave it today and it's a big reason why I am returning), of course the famous Ishigaki Beef and if you feel adventurous, Yagi-Sashi (raw goat meat). There's also some fastfood with Mosburger, McDonald's I think and something that I only saw on Okinawa, an A&W (like the root beer) restaurant. If you drink, you're not gonna get around the famous Okinawa Orion beer and the stronger Awamori.  Also last advice: if you can, rent a car as the bus intervals can be veeeeery long (I once had to wait 5 hours), especially if you go to parts of the island that are a bit further.  Anyways, that's all I have, if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask :)"

It's 1.5x points for every $1 you spent, and the rewards can be applied to any travel related spending in the past 6 months or something like that.  Also, if you use a credit card at a place that can use a different currency for the transaction, ignore it and use the local currency. For example, if you buy something at the duty free at the NRT airport, use the BofA card and choose YEN, not USD or your home currency.  I know it seems counter intuitive, but it's because if you choose YEN, your credit card company will just use the daily currency rate. If you choose USD, the store will use a favorable rate for them and you will lose some money."

JapanTravel,39l4jq,satannik,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:17:01 2015 UTC,"I just got back from Japan last week. I spent a month there and used my BoA debit card. You cannot use it like you can in America by just being able to just straight up buy things with it at the cash register. You'll need a credit card for that.  Short answer is to withdraw a good portion of cash in America and exchange it at a Japanese bank. Although BoA gave a good exchange rate, the fees aren't terrible but they exist. It's like 5 from BoA, and another 5USD for using a foreign card. Basically cancelling out the exchange rate if you're withdrawing small amounts.  If you HAVE to use your card to withdraw money visit any 7/11 convenience store and use their ATM's. They're fully translated into English. Also make sure to notify your bank that you will be out of country for the duration of your stay in Japan."
JapanTravel,39l4jq,hk1018,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"Most places are cash only, so you'll want cash on you always. You can get a bunch of yen before you leave, but ideally you'd just withdraw as you need it - and there's a way to withdraw for free! There are two types of withdrawal fees: fees from the ATM, and fees from your card/bank. ATMs in 7-11s in Japan are fee free, and the Charles Schwab debit card is fee free worldwide (for withdrawls, not for payments!)  What I do when traveling to Japan now is move money there before my trip (I was too lazy to move everything over from my other account), and withdraw when needed. It costs nothing to have an account (no minimum balance, no monthly deposits required).  As for card payments, get a credit card with no foreign transaction fees. I was able to get the British Airways Visa before my first trip, after calling the reconsideration line explaining why I needed the card. I also use my DiscoverIT card (no fees) which works with JCB merchants in Japan, but Visa has wider acceptance. You're better off using a credit card rather than a debit card for card payments (as long as you treat it like a debit card, set up autopay to pay your balance off in full each month!)"

It would make a lot more sense to just go from Tokyo to Fuji Five Lakes on the 14th.    If it is related to your luggage just ship your luggage via takuhaibin from Tokyo to Nagoya so that it is there when you arrive on the 15th. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html    Buy your Ghibli tickets now if you haven't already. Buy your Sumo tickets now if you haven't already. Note that the Japanese (Lawson) allocation for Ghibli is completely sold out for all of July. I suspect JTB will be sold out too but may be worth asking depending on which country you are in. You may have to buy off Yahoo Auctions.      If you don't go to Nagoya on the 14th then a JR Pass will not pay off. Just buy individual tickets. If you do go to Nagoya on the 14th then I guess you can consider a 7-day JR Pass. Seems a strange way to do it to me though.

You will want to buy supplies before you get to the 5th station when you visit Mt. Fuji. Everything is way more expensive once you arrive, and prices only get worse as you climb.  Also, I wouldn't schedule stuff for the day when you climb down. I don't know what kind of shape you're in, but I doubt you'll be up for a full day of activities after 12ish hours of strenuous physical activity and thin air."
JapanTravel,39k1pt,david_131,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:16:28 2015 UTC,I agree regarding the concern about activities after Fuji. Only thing we had planned to do was see the Sumo Matches that day. So not really gonna be running around.    The concern was time wise...would we be cutting it close getting off of Fuji in the morning...getting into Nagoya...changing/cleaning up at hotel...then heading to Sumo matches.  I think that timing may be too tight.
JapanTravel,39k1pt,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:56:46 2015 UTC,In general I recommend arriving at Sumo around 1pm or if you only want to watch the top two divisions then 2:30pm is fine. You should be able to make this easily enough from Mt Fuji.     Note for Kawaguchiko to Nagoya you can follow the main instructions here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6905.html?aFROM=2157_6900
JapanTravel,39izzy,ViewtifulSchmoe,2,Fri Jun 12 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with that particular program but if you are tall, the extra legroom on a 12+ hour flight could very well be worth it"
JapanTravel,39izzy,chason,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'9"" (1.75 m), so basically average or just below average height for an American. If I were taller this would be a no-brainer. I just don't want to drop $170 that I could spend once I'm in Japan."

JapanTravel,39izzy,santacruzmtb,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for letting me know about the entertainment. I'm less inclined to upgrade now that I know it makes no difference there. Delta also gives free beer and wine to all classes on international flights, so all I get for upgrading is liquor. Looks like it might not be worth it."
JapanTravel,39izzy,pandemi,2,Fri Jun 12 02:02:08 2015 UTC,"I flew first when I went but I would completely recommend delta comfort+ for $169. Coach is miserable on a 12ish hour flights, especially if you're trying to get some rest."
JapanTravel,39izzy,datnikkadee,2,Fri Jun 12 03:22:38 2015 UTC,Just get drink with the free wine in the economy class and you wont even notice its uncomfortable

JapanTravel,39izzy,FishFollower74,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:32:25 2015 UTC,100% worth it. Booked it for the return flight as soon as I landed in Tokyo last year. Will do it again.
JapanTravel,39izzy,DauntlessFencer93,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"I used to fly United about once a year to Japan. Their equivalent of Comfort+ was Economy Plus. I never paid for the upgrade, just took standard coach and looked for an aisle seat. I'm a little shorter (about 5'5"") so I don't need the legroom, and there's no other real advantage I can see. I don't sleep on planes so if I have an aisle seat I can wander, etc."
JapanTravel,39izzy,CercleRouge,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a couple inches shorter than you and flew coach here on Delta. I got a window seat to lean against and had no problem catching a few hours of sleep (it was daytime the entire trip and i was very excited to get here so I couldn't sleep much anyway). If you're worried about the money, it's not worth it to upgrade."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,teachinginspace,6,Thu Jun 11 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"Don't bring cash; get a debit card instead. See if you can find a bank that has a generous debit card. I have a Charles Schwab Checking Account and it refunds all ATM fees.  While in Japan, just go to a 7-11 and use your debit card to get money as you need it. There is NO need for currency exchanges. For what it's worth, the ATMs at 7-11 never even charged me a fee so the nice perk of my Schwab checking account never had to kick in.  Not that Japan is dangerous or anything but it's also safer to not carry around $2,000.  Let me know if you have any questions. I just got back from a month-long trip there.  Cheers!"
JapanTravel,39hwi0,marktronic,2,Fri Jun 12 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"adding onto this post... if you do decide to go the atm route, don't forget to notify your bank that you're going to Japan and you might also want to increase the withdrawal limit so you can pull as much cash out as you want one time.  Great info here on fees: http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/debit-card-foreign-transaction-international-atm-fees/"
JapanTravel,39hwi0,similarities,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yes - great point!  Credit cards aren't widely accepted in Japan, but it might be worth having one or two on hand just in case. Airports are pretty credit card friendly. When I was coming home, I used my remaining cash on omiyage/souvenirs and then used my credit card to get other stuff since I only had a little cash left.  If you have a no foreign transaction fee credit card that would be ideal obviously. Capital One has a Quicksilver card that is fee-free and does not have an annual fee."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,marktronic,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:56:39 2015 UTC,I would be more worried about losing 2000$ of cash than someone steal it. But yeah debit card is best option.
JapanTravel,39hwi0,nou_spiro,0,Fri Jun 12 08:35:02 2015 UTC,Yes - exact same concern here if I was carrying around a lot of money.
JapanTravel,39hwi0,marktronic,3,Fri Jun 12 18:04:43 2015 UTC,There are very few currency exchanges (like the ones you see in the countries you mention) in Tokyo.
JapanTravel,39hwi0,ukatama,2,Thu Jun 11 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a Canadian and I was in Japan a few weeks ago. I use TD for my day to day banking and was UNABLE to use 7-11 ATM's. My card did not work at any of them (well not in Kyoto at least).  I simply used Japan Post ATMs and had no problem there. One thing to note, these machines are not 24 hours."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,MoneyWeHave,0,Sat Jun 13 01:23:40 2015 UTC,Was there any fees just curious (I'm with TD too)  I also have a Tangerine debit
JapanTravel,39hwi0,DauntlessFencer93,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'm with TD Bank (US, not canadian) and my debit card works perfectly at all 7-11's I've been to."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,MoneyWeHave,0,Sun Jun 14 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"If you have a select service account with TD and withdraw from there, you get no fees. I looked at the exchange when I got home and it was close enough to the spot rate.  I never figured out why my card didn't work at 7-11 but at least it worked at the post office. Not as convenient but they weren't that hard to find with the google.  If by change you're in Toronto. Guardian currency exchange at Yonge / Adelaide does not charge any fees and their rate is very competitive. I got about $100,000 yen in advance from them."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,wuerworm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:36:48 2015 UTC,"I recommend exchanging your money at home and taking it with you to Japan. Also doesn't hurt to have a couple hundreds more to take with you in case you need more cash.  Another option like many posts have said, is to open a Charles Schwab so you can use its ATM card in Japan to withdraw cash. Also I recommend using a no foreign transaction fee credit card/debit card whenever you can, and save the cash for places that don't take card."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,GosuMagic,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:54:07 2015 UTC,Well this might be a shocker to you but you are ripping yourself off. None what you speak of is an ideal way to get Japanese currency. It would be best if you can get a capitol one 360 debit card. Goto any 7-eleven and get money through their atm. No fees whatsoever.
JapanTravel,39hwi0,chazchaz101,0,Fri Jun 12 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"I am going to disagree with everyone and tell you to bring USD dollars. Most large post offices offer foreign currency exchange at good rates. I don't know why people were having so much trouble.  In my experience, exchanging at the airport or a bank is almost always a ripoff."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,jamar030303,0,Fri Jun 12 05:08:26 2015 UTC,"Where in Canada are you? Vancouver, for instance, has independent currency exchange shops (VBCE, Kingmark, etc) that will change to and from yen at a rate good enough that you won't need to bother with bringing US$ to Japan, and I can't imagine Toronto, Calgary, etc not having anything similar.   Otherwise, as ukatama says, currency exchange shops aren't very commonly found on arrival once you leave the airport."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,piensa,0,Fri Jun 12 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ukatama, there's very few currency exchange places that I found outside of Tokyo.  I exchanged one thousand at the airport and later had trouble finding somewhere else to exchange the rest of my cash.  I was there during Golden Week in May. I traveled as far north as Aomori and as far south as Hiroshima, for context.  I very much recommend exchanging it at a bank before you leave to Japan. Though keep in mind sometimes banks require a week or more to exchange it, depending on the bank and it's location (if it's near an international airport it's likely they have other currencies on hand).  Have fun and safe travels!"
JapanTravel,39hwi0,jamar030303,0,Fri Jun 12 00:52:05 2015 UTC,Well are chip cards okay (for ATM)?  I'm in Canada so we have INTERAC and MAESTRO  my other debit has INTERLINK and PLUS and VISA DEBIT (never used that before)
JapanTravel,39hwi0,amyranthlovely,0,Fri Jun 12 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"Your chip card should be OK.   If you live in a big city, consider opening an account with ICBK. It's UnionPay, so it's accepted at a lot more ATMs than either your Maestro or your Visa card, and they only charge a fixed ATM fee instead of tacking on a foreign exchange fee like most Canadian banks do."
JapanTravel,39hwi0,JustVan,0,Fri Jun 12 03:00:41 2015 UTC,"Maestro, PLUS and VISA Debit are all fine for use at any 7-11 ATM"
JapanTravel,39hwi0,ShawninOP,-1,Fri Jun 12 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"Take cash, and exchange it now before you go. Take maybe $200.00 over what you have already calculated as necessary in case you do run out and don't break it unless you absolutely have to. That way, you can exchange it back when you return. I've never had to exchange it back, but I've always managed to run some kind of miscalculation and had to spend a bit extra for necessities. And it's always been when I've been nowhere near an ATM that takes my card. :/"
JapanTravel,39hwjk,nothrowawayaccount__,2,Thu Jun 11 20:48:31 2015 UTC,I'd say spend sometime in kyoto? From Which airport do you leave Japan?
JapanTravel,39hwjk,Xelank,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"We are going to spend most of the time in Kyoto when we are in Osaka. We leave at the Narita Airport, sorry, forgot to mention that.  Do you think there is enough to see around Kyoto/Osaka to stay a little bit longer there?"
JapanTravel,39hwjk,saytseff,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:44:19 2015 UTC,I would say that there is more to see in Kyoto than Tokyo. After traveling around Kyoto for a week I found Tokyo quite bland and uninteresting. There's definitely more historical and cultural sites to visit in Kyoto.   A say in Nikko and Kamakura maybe? On the way to Osaka you have Hakone as well.   Himeji you should be able to visit en route to Hiroshima as well.
JapanTravel,39hwjk,boxofplaydoh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:08:12 2015 UTC,Id say this varies by the person.  That is if you are more into the cultural/historical stuff - then spend more time in kyoto  If you are more into city life/night life/etc then spend more time in tokyo
JapanTravel,39hwjk,Xelank,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:06:28 2015 UTC,There are lots of interesting places around kyoto and Osaka. Personally I'm staying a grand total of around 9 days in the area
JapanTravel,39hwjk,mychyu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hi! Ive been to Kyoto/Osaka twice and due to work I always go for a really short time. First time i went 3 days to kyoto and second time only 1 day. I think 3 is much better. My suggestion would be to do 1 day of sightseeing in the city (golden pavillion, fushimi inari, and some smaller temples around), 1 half day in arashiyama mountain and night at gion. Then the 3rd day just for shopping souvenirs and seeing anything you didnt have timr to see.  I write a blog and summarized my last trip to osaka & kyoto, you can check it out and get some ideas from there!  Http://whereismimiyu.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/trip-osaka-kyoto  I would still spend 2 days in osaka (since you dont have the same time restraints as I did) because food and just enjoying Japan in general.  Also when i went to tokyo I spent 6 days,  and for 2 of them i went to izu peninsula+fuji mountain.  I hope i helped!"

My husband hates seafood and egg, and many restaurants have been willing to make substitutions (some being better than others).  I always make sure to let them know his preferences at the reservation stage though.  The restaurant that did the best job at accommodating this was Narisawa (ranked by San Pellegrino as the best restaurant in Japan), and it also happens to be my favorite restaurant for many reasons. If you can tolerate fish to some degree, then you have many more choices and would probably do best looking for a restaurant that has menus listed online and take your pick from there.  Restaurants that my husband has liked include Pierre Gagnaire in Roppongi and Sant Pau in Nihonbashi (as well as of course Narisawa)."

JapanTravel,39gte8,xinganbaobei,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding the subway, most people tend to be quiet and keep to themselves if that means anything.

JapanTravel,39gte8,FriedGold,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"What exactly freaks you out about the subway? If it's just the social aspect, don't sweat it - there's no human interaction required at any point. Just swipe your card to get into and out of the stations. When you're on the train everyone is silent and no one will try and engage you in any way. It's not like North American transit systems where you will inevitably have to interact with crazy people.  If it's the underground/claustrophobic aspect, you could stay somewhere along the Yamanote line which is above ground and circles the city, going to most major areas.  But if you absolutely can't deal with it for whatever reason, you're 30 minutes-1 hour walk from Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza, Harajuku or Tokyo Tower area. If you don't mind walking a couple hours a day you would never run out of things to do."
JapanTravel,39gte8,fake_gojira,0,Thu Jun 11 19:20:50 2015 UTC,It's the people aspect honestly. I was freaked out when were in the Philippines visiting her family. I stood out like a sore thumb. :\

And, yes, I stood out like a sore thumb, too, being a brown girl and all, but honestly, no one bothers you - I even went alone while my SO was sleeping to do grocery shopping (we rented an apartment) and not one person looked at me oddly.

But no one is going to call attention to it or make you feel uncomfortable, especially on the subway. And certainly no one will be hostile to you as an outsider - if anything it's the complete opposite, where people are happy to help if you ask them and excited to talk to a visitor who loves their country enough to travel halfway around the world."

I know it can be overwhelming trying to plan a trip, especially not being familiar with the area. Roppongi isn't one of the 'best places to go'. I am not sure where you got that idea. Roppongi has a reputation for Nigerian touts, gaijin bars, and overall seedy stuff."

JapanTravel,39ex8w,charade_scandal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you do decide to hit the madness this is a cool tequila bar across the street from the start of the strip:  http://agave.jp/  Pricey but good décor. More of a spot to hill by yourself.   Last year I did go to a couple bars in the greater Roppongi area that I enjoyed and that are away from the madness:   George's Soul Bar  Kind of a bar that time forgot. Newest location (but still old) of a Tokyo institution. Ratty but in a great way. It was pretty quiet that night I went but they have an upstairs area for DJ events  Main barkeep (a young woman) speaks decent English. Google Maps pin is accurate. Near but just off some main streets. Pretty obvious sign when you see it. Kind of sleepy if they don’t have events but plenty of seating and has its charms for sure.  http://www.georgesbar.co.jp/english/index.html  If you did end up going to These Library Lounge it would make sense to at least pop in for one beer here.  These Library Lounge   Really cool spot! Hard to describe but has a cool adult but not sleek or stuffy vibe. Sounds dumb to say but a good place for 30-somethings!  Pretty inventive layout. Good diverse menu with English. I must say man some of the best french fries I've had in ages.  Prices are reasonable and my bill was much less than I thought it would be for a place that had as good a vision as it had. You'll see with the links I've attached that it's kind of inscrutable and hard to really describe but I really do think you should check it out.   The Google Maps pin is ok and it's actually on a smaller side street. I'll be honest, it was a little tough for me to find. One of those ones where you are like ""I'm here but I can't see it"". They have a pretty small entrance and sign but I think making it a bit of a secret is part of their thing. It's a bit of a hike from the station that Google Maps recommended I go to (forgot which) but it's almost totally in a straight line. It's just when you get to the actual block where it's a bit hard to find the door.   But anyway, don't get dissuaded to go based on what I just wrote. Recommended. It's not the kind of place for a WILD AND CRAZY TOKYO NIGHT but I know for sure you'll all be like 'wow this place is amazing.'  Both George's and These Library Lounge are approx 8-10 minutes away from each other so a decent suggestion for two close but different bars to hit.  http://accidentalepicurean.com/2011/09/these-library-lounge-try-the-late-night-offbeat-insider-tokyo-cocktail-scene/"
JapanTravel,39ex8w,charade_scandal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"Shinjuku Scene   Golden Gai Area  Hair of the Dog Great   Tiny ground-floor bar. Has a sandwich board and/or easy to see door. Host speaks good English and always has amazing punk playing. In maybe the second or third row in Golden Gai (it's a grid an that will make sense when you are there). There is a cover. Tends to be a mix of Japanese and tourists. Good small place to meet people and/or just chat with him. Recommended.   Here's a review that I attached mostly to give you an idea of what Golden Gai looks like. http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d480651-r156460577-Shinjuku_Golden_Gai-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html   Who Bar   Another cool place is called Who Bar. Looks for the mod-coloured sign. It's 2nd floor so you'll be looking for the sign and a stairwell. Great, great, intimate place. Hosts don't speak great English but are really nice. Seems to appeal mostly to locals so you'll probably meet some cool Japanese folks.   La Jetee   http://lajetee.org/address/ http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/venue/404/La-Jet%C3%A9e   Highly recommended. 2nd floor. The owner is an older woman and it closes earlier than many spots in the area. I'd maybe check it out first when you go to the area. It's VERY SMALL and sadly you may be go and find there's no spots. Looks for the sign and a stairwell up.   Zoetrope   Cool scotch/movie bar in Shinjuku. Very vast selection from all prices levels so you go crazy if scotch is your thing or just buy lower priced stuff and enjoy the atmosphere. Owner is an interesting cat who likes everything to be just so so he's usually cleaning or arranging something and does not really have time to chat but that's fine.He usually plays these really cool DVD's of edited Japanese movies trailers that are pretty hypnotic to watch. I guess since he's got a pretty big web presence in English on Time Out etc there were quite a few tourists when I was there.   Defo worth a visit. You're walking distance from Golden Gai etc so if it's not your thing and/or your finish with it you're close to other options.  Google Maps pin is not great! The pin takes you to an arbitrary spot not too far from Shinjuku Station and you're like 'errrrrrrr' I don't see anything. From what I remember there is a three way stop with a diagonal street. It's on that street. So walk up that street. It's not too far from the intersection. Like 20 seconds. You'll see a sign with the eyeball logo. There it is. I remember when I went I was just about to give up and head to the Gai but...the pin takes you pretty close you just need to figure out that last 20 seconds.   Hope this link works but this image will make finding Zoetrope easier. If it's the correct image you'll see a guy in an orange t-shirt. The bar is up that street that the fellow and his friends are walking from. If you look straight ahead that's towards the station and probably the direction you're coming from. The pin puts you around where the crosswalk is so you just have to go up the diagonal side-street.   https://www.google.ca/maps/@35.6948612,139.6986679,3a,75y,176.02h,100.39t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sAQEkzQmaJ5FwTnHz6L8DgQ!2e0  8 Bit Cafe   Really cool video game, electronic-culture bar right on the main drag of Shinjuku (as far as I remember). Here's a kind of a budget blog review but it does capture the atmosphere of it:  http://www.kirainet.com/english/8bit-cafe/  Large food  menu, Good pick for early drinks and snacks. You'll like it! Google Maps pin is accurate but it's still hard to find as there is not a lot of street-level signage. I'm surprised to see a chalk-board in the blog as I don't remember that and had to look for a tiny sign attached to the building. Again, a location that when you are there but will take a couple extra mins when you are outside to actually see it. Remember, it's on the 5th floor so you have to find the sign as there is no other indication you're at the right place. I remember the colour scheme of sign and stairwell to be white if that helps.   Staff are very friendly but speak limited English.   Again, like Zoetrope, it's not too far from other busier areas so it's a good place to start an evening or even for a after-dinner drink before recharging at the hotel before going out again. Good spot.  Shinjuku ni-chome   The gay-area in Shinjuku. It's worth a wander especially since it's only about 5-10 mins from Golden Gai etc. Just about all the bars are 'members only' but there is a place called:   The Advocate  Seems to be the centre of the neighborhood and there are always tons of foreigners milling around outside it with pints. Would be a good place to meet and chat with other travelers if you wished (I guess I prefer locals although the language barrier at times is a shame).  It's more of an English Style bar so large with more seating etc than typical for that area. Google Maps has a pin for it. If you're close, a decent place to at least just walk through and take a look at the scene."
JapanTravel,39ex8w,charade_scandal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Smaller bars are often closed one day a week. Usually Mondays but sometimes Tuesday or Sunday.

I highly recommend not entering the dumb line you see for Himeji Castle, it just takes you to the top of the building and is not worth it. Instead, go through the side and look at the grounds. Then, go to the gardens, that's the beautiful part.   I know you need to pay to get into Himeji and a separate payment for the Kokoen Gardens next door.  So did you pay for both?  Is there anything to actually see inside the castle?  I live in Scotland so am used to Edinburgh castle with the banquet halls etc. Is the only way to see inside via that long line?"

JapanTravel,39dyx5,rainbow_city,2,Thu Jun 11 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"Since 9 and 10 are heading west, they just don't bother to call it the Ueno-Tokyo line.  The Ueno-Tokyo line and the Tokaido main line are the same thing, I live out in Kanagawa on the Tokaido main line and all my trains are either Ueno-Tokyo or Shonan-Shinjuku now.  A lot of major stations use both sides of a track for direction for reasons such as 1:too many passenger getting on and off, often the other side is unused  2:trains might terminate and originate at that station, so you can have one trained parked one side for ten minutes before it leaves.  My station is set-up like this too, and this has been my observation about why it's set-up this way."
JapanTravel,39dyx5,its_real_I_swear,2,Thu Jun 11 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"It's pretty arbitrary. Especially at Tokyo there are many reasons for extra platforms. Parking trains, limited express, the airport train, commuter rapids, cross platform transfers etc."
JapanTravel,39dyx5,Gonazar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:38:10 2015 UTC,"They're extra services and one reason I love the Japanese transit system.  I've seen several instances where you have something like a main service, limited express service, rapid service and special rapid service. Often taking 2 or more platforms.  Basically the main service will follow the expected route and stop at every station. The limited express and rapid services will skip a bunch of the smaller stations and only go to the major ones by taking a second track. That's great if you're going farther because you're not held up by stopping at every station or by a train going slower than yours.  Many lines in Tokyo are built between point A and point B, but often don't physically end there. Since the city is so large, they'll tack on another line to the end of another.  This means you can take two Keisei lines then the Toei Asakusa subway from Narita Airport to Ginza (near Tokyo station) without having to get off the same train. It just continues from one service to another. Additionally if you went to the end of the Asakusa line, got off and waited for the next train, that one would do the same but the opposite end and take you past Kawasaki and Yokohama to Yokusoku which is at the end of the peninsula that is Tokyo Bay's west coast.  Anyways, with multiple lines connected to each other, it's not unusual to have a special service that does express on one line then switches to regular on another. You'll actually see that on the line map inside the train which makes it all the more confusing because it has to show everywhere that train will go.  The Shinkansen it's a bit special because building it's track is so expensive. Typically the majority of the line is only two tracks, one for each direction and smaller stations will only have two platforms. What they do is switch off the main track to platform tracks at the station so it's actually 4 wide. The normal service will switch off and stop at every platform, while the faster express services will pass on the through tracks in the middle while the normal service train is in station. It's kind of crazy considering there is a bullet train going several hundred kph every 3 minutes and they have to time the slower train pulling off to a station in order for the express to pass them. At major stations, the shinkansen line will break up into multiple platforms to hold more trains and run multiple services. Nozomi is the fastest, an express service that goes from Tokyo to Hakata, Hikari is the same service though less frequent using older trains so it's slightly slower. Kodama is the slowest being the regular service that stops at every station. If you're at any major station in the middle of the line you would expect 4-6 platforms to handle these three services in each direction. Even more at Hakata which connects the Kyushuu shinkansen lines/services.  TL;DR There's multiple tracks and platforms to service multiple services of the same line in order to allow express lines to pass slower trains."

JapanTravel,39azm6,stanisl0v3,3,Wed Jun 10 15:03:43 2015 UTC,You could save quite a bit of travel time by getting an open jaw ticket and departing from Kansai International Airport instead of going all the way back to Narita. Which would give you another day of seeing stuff in Tokyo for example.   Compare for example this vs this (even tho it has a layover in haneda of 1h20m it's almost 350 $ cheaper and saves a 350+ mile train journey as well)
JapanTravel,39azm6,wggn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Open-jaw ticket:       An open-jaw ticket is a round-trip ticket in which the traveler does not arrive to the same city of departure and/or does not depart from the same city where they first landed. The path-lines between the airports form an open angle, rather than a closed loop, and the angle resembles an open jawline. This is sometimes called an ARNK (arrival unknown). The traveler will use some other transport to travel between the airports. It is sometimes also called multi-city, but that might also be a ticket with three flight legs forming a closed loop.

JapanTravel,39azm6,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 10 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Well yes it's very Kyoto heavy. An reason why you're only spending two and a half days in Tokyo? I think it's an amazing and huge city, certainly worth going to longer than for two days (last time I stayed 8 days overall and still only felt like I barely scratched the surface of it). It also seems you want to spend a night in Nara. Any specific reason for that? Because Imo, Nara is usually just worth a day trip. You could even consider Osaka as a day trip to if you feel like it and just base yourself in Kyoto and do Nara, Osaka (and possibly Kobe) as a side trip."
JapanTravel,39azm6,adam_364,2,Wed Jun 10 15:48:21 2015 UTC,I've heard from a lot of people that Osaka is really awesome so figured I would spend a few nights there.

Since you're coming to Narita Airport, it would be smart to visit these areas and attractions first. Then you can plan a day trip to Mt Fuji which lies a fair distance outside of Tokyo. Kyoto, Osaka, and Hiroshima are all cities far Southwest of Tokyo. A train to Osaka or Kyoto would take at least a day, and Hiroshima is even farther than them. 11 days is possible, but you wouldn't get much exposure to each city, maybe a day or three."

You could probably find enough stuff in Tokyo to satisfy yourself for 11 days. In fact, when I visit Tokyo in July I'll be there for 11 days. But, your trip is doable. An example could be, Shinjuku/Shibuya/Akihabara for two days and Ghibli museum third day. Then train to Osaka and spend three days there. Then 3 days in Kyoto. That leaves like 2 days for Hiroshima and getting back."

From Kyoto to Seiransou just use www.hyperdia.com and use from Kyoto and to Yugawara. Will you have an active JR Pass? This will limit you to Hikari/Kodama Shinkansen but that won't make too much difference for this journey. From Kyoto you are likely to have to transfer once or twice but it depends a little on which path you take, what time you depart, and what your priorities are. Probably Hikari Shinkansen from Kyoto to Odawara and then Tokaido Line to Yugawara Station will be a reasonable option for you.

JapanTravel,3991fy,sierra-juliet,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:49:26 2015 UTC,"I would buy a 7-day JR Pass if you can (now!). I see you are in China so that may be difficult but you may be able to get one sent express/fedex to your first hotel in Narita perhaps. Pretty sure places like www.jrpass.com have handled these sort of requests in the past.  Exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass preferably at Narita when you arrive on the 18th. Make your seat reservations at the exchange office for your journey on the 19th from Narita Airport (or Narita) to Shinagawa and then for the Hikari Shinkansen from Shinagawa to Kyoto. Transferring at Shinagawa is a bit easier/quicker than transferring at Tokyo Station.    You can then use the JR Pass for some of your around Tokyo travel using the Yamanote line and the Chuo line etc if you wish. You can also use the JR Pass for the Narita Express from Tokyo back to Narita Airport, just note that you should make a free seat reservation for the Narita Express.    Note if you can't get a JR Pass in time due to the fact you are in China then you can just pay for individual tickets. It won't be that much more expensive and it will allow you to use the slightly faster Nozomi Shinkansen to get to Kyoto.  On June 21 I would recommend you visit the Toji Temple Market in the morning. You can walk there from Kyoto Station:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3919.html"

Basically just get the train to Yugawara station (use the Hyperdia app/site to figure out how to get there) and then there's a bus.. bus number pending :)  EDIT: Yugawara, not Oku-Yugawara station.  EDIT EDIT: Well look at that, the reason I thought Oku-Yugawara is because that's the bus you catch! It's really easy to notice as it was one of the only ones written in English. We said Seiranso to the bus driver and he yelled it out for us when it was our stop; once you get off the bus walk down the hill about 50 metres and it's to your left.. we made the mistake of going further up the hill until asking someone for directions.

So unless you want to bring back a japanese automatic toilet... (it's not a joke, it can be done, and is the kind of things that would be much cheaper in Japan than anywhere else.)  Photography stuff is an area where Japan is usually in advance (and thus cheaper). But it's usually expensive of course.  You can maybe find silk yukata/haori less expensive.  Bottom line is, ""useful stuff"" that's really cheaper than somewhere else will already be pretty expensive.  I'd stick to the usual food and customized stuff (just bought a rilakkuma camera for my gf's sister). And even those can be found online.

JapanTravel,39651l,SexForGold,3,Tue Jun 9 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"July 14    Tsukiji is great and all, but as long as you're in that general vicinity (East Tokyo), you might as well check out Kappabashi (if either of you are into cooking in any way)."
JapanTravel,39651l,ukatama,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:01:24 2015 UTC,Thank you. I will look into Kappabashi.
JapanTravel,39651l,david_131,2,Wed Jun 10 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"I assume you plan on getting a 14-day JR Pass? I would set the activation date as July 13 so you can use it on July 26 to get back to Narita. Note that you can set the activation date when you exchange your voucher for the actual JR Pass when you arrive on the 10th, just make sure you specify July 13 as the activation date.    Buy a Suica when you arrive and use it for the first couple of days and for non-JR Transport in Tokyo and the other cities. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html     July 12: Western Tokyo Itinerary from Japan Guide     I usually suggest you walk down the stairs to the left of Hachiko to see the Tokyu Food Show/Court also.     July 13: Day trip to Nikko     Sounds fine, if from Shinjuku with a JR Pass you have a number of options depending on your preferences regarding how to get there, but Shinkansen via Utsunomiya is often a reasonable way. Ask if you are unsure.     July 14: Wake up early to check out the Tsukiji Fish Market.     Do you plan on going to the tuna auction? If so I would arrive at 3:45am or so. You will need to take a taxi from Shinjuku. If you don't plan on going that early then you can take the subway and then have breakfast first, explore outer markets, then explore the wholesale market after 9am. Note the long queues for sushi if you plan to have sushi at some of the popular places like Daiwa Sushi or Sushi Dai.     After Tsukiji you can walk from there back into Ginza if you like. As mentioned Kappabashi may interest you too.   July 15: We are traveling to Takayama but will be stopping for a couple hours in Nagoya to watch part of a Sumo Tournament.     Are you staying in a ryokan? Note that for the Sumo I usually suggest you arrive around 1pm or maybe 2:30pm but not later than that so you can see the top two divisions. Sumo finishes at 6pm and I would recommend you stay until the end. This will make for a late check-in to Takayama.     July 16: Explore Takayama (Old Town, Hida Folk Village, Higashiyama Walk). Travel to Kanazawa in the afternoon.     How are you going to Kanazawa? Train? I would maybe consider dropping Hida Folk Village and taking the bus from Takayama to Shirakawago, spend 2-4 hours in Shirakawago, then take bus from Shirakawago to Kanazawa. This may be a little ""fast"" though.      July 18: Travel to Kyoto. Ginkakuji, Philosopher's Path, Nanzenji, Keage Incline, Heian Shrine, Yasaka Shrine, Kodaiji, Higashiyama Streets, Kyomizudera.     Too much for one day probably.     July 20: Kyoto - Monkey Park, Togetsukyo Bridge, Tenryuji, Bamboo Groves, Jojakkoji, Gioji, Saga-Toriimoto Preserved Street, Otagi Nenbutsuji, Daikakuji.     A busy day.     July 21: Kyoto - Nothing particularly planned for this day - would welcome suggestions. Might go check out To-ji Temple Kobo ichi Market.     I would definitely recommend Toji Temple Markets. Maybe Fushimi Inari afterwards?     July 22: Travel to Mt. Koya. We are staying at one of the temples for the evening. I haven't planned for much this day other than just exploring Koya in general.     Maybe Koysan World Heritage Ticket:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_012.html     July 23: Travel to Osaka. Osaka Aquarium? Dotonbori at night. Open to additional suggestions for things to do during the day.     Seems fine. Maybe Abeno Harukas, Umeda Sky, Osaka Castle (although concrete).     July 24: Hiroshima in the morning. Travel to Miyajima in the afternoon.     Leave early. I assume you will go to the Peace Park/Museum? Don't underestimate the time from there to Miyajima.      July 25: Explore Miyajima. Might hike the Daisho-in Course. Travel to Himeji and explore Himeji Castle. Then travel to Tokyo for the evening.     A very long day.     July 26: We have a few hours in the morning to explore Tokyo before we have to catch our flight at 7 PM.     Maybe Ueno/Ameyoko?    Overall this is a very fast pace which I assume you prefer. Have you booked your accommodation already? I might have considered Kyoto - Hiroshima - Koyasan - Osaka - Tokyo instead to break up your travel a bit."
JapanTravel,39651l,wuerworm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"Gosh I couldn't even have anticipated such a detailed response.  Thank you very much!  We did buy the 14 day JR Pass and plan to activate it on July 13 like you suggested.  Thanks for the tip about the Suica.  July 12:  Will add this to my itinerary.  July 13: Shinkansen via Utsunomiya is the way we plan to go.  July 14:  Yes, we would love to go to the tuna auction if we feel up for waking up at 3 AM.  I really would enjoy it but we will see how tired we are.  I considered going to the auction on our second day in the city but that would be a Saturday and I don't know how much more difficult it would be to get into the auctions on a weekend versus a weekday.  Thoughts?  July 15: We are not staying in a Ryokan in Takayama.  We are staying in a Ryokan for 2 nights in Kanazawa.  I do realize that the top divisions start their bouts in the afternoon, but unfortunately I think we will have to settle for seeing some of the lower divisions.  As neither of us have ever seen sumo in person, it is just important that we get to watch it for a little bit, regardless of the competition level.  Therefore, to get to Takayama at a decent time, we will probably leave the tournament sometime around 2 PM.   July 16:  I was planning to take the limited express train or shinkansen to Kanazawa, but I will look into Shirakawago.  I have never heard of that.  July 18 & July 20:  I will consider dropping a couple of the items from these days.  These were the daily itineraries suggested by Japan-Guide, but I can modify them if need be.  July 21: Thanks for the suggestion on Fushimi Inari.  I will look into it.  July 22:  Definitely planning on getting the World Heritage ticket.  July 23:  Already added Umeda Sky and Osaka Castle to the itinerary based on another suggested here.  I will look into Abeno Harukas.  July 24:  Thanks for the advice.  Will keep this in mind.  July 25:  Will definitely be a long day.  I might consider forwarding our luggage to Tokyo so we don't have to haul it with us.   July 26: Will look into Ueno and Ameyoko.  Ultimately I know this will be a very fast-paced trip, but this will likely be the only time we ever make it to Japan, so we want to make sure we don't miss anything.  Lodging is already booked, and while some of them could be changed, others are non-refundable, so the overall timeline of the trip is pretty set in stone at this point.  Thanks again for your input.  I greatly appreciate it."
JapanTravel,39651l,wuerworm,2,Wed Jun 10 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"July 10: On the day you arrive, you plan on going to the Metropolitan Government Building to check out the observation deck. While that place is really awesome to see, it is a bit of a walk (~15-20 min) from the station. I'm concerned that you'll be flying in the same day, and you'll have jet lag and be really tired. And since it's summer, it doesn't get dark until 7pm. So if you can, maybe save it for another night?   July 14: I don't know where you're from, but I'm from the US and we usually wake up really really early the morning after we arrive in Japan. We try to take advantage of this to go to Tsukiji for their amazing sushi. So this is another suggestion if you're from the US. When you do go to Tsukiji, I find that it's really fun to explore Ginza which is right next to the market. So if you run out of stuff to do at Tsukiji, head on over to Ginza and explore the department stores there. It's fun to people watch the rich Japanese and see what they buy and stuff.   July 18: are you visiting Ginkakuji or Kinkakuji? Cus they are two different places, and Gin is definitely the less popular one. Gin means silver, but the temple never got enough funding to cover it in silver, so it looks like a traditional Japanese building. Kinkakuji (gold pavilion) is the gold covered one that most tourists visit.   July 23: Have you already been to Osaka Castle? If not, def worth a visit during the day. The Umeda Sky building is also already pretty cool building to visit. It has some kind of ""couples"" balcony on the top floor. The building itself is really cool architecturally so it's nice to take pictures."
JapanTravel,39651l,chazchaz101,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:23:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, first off, thank you very much for your response.  July 10:  That is a very good point.  We might not feel up for much at all after our flight.  I can easily stick this at the end of another day if we are too tired.  July 14: We are from the US.  The main reason I had planned to go to Tsukiji on this day rather than the day after we arrive is because the day after we arrive is a Saturday.  I was thinking that we would have a better chance of getting in for the auction on a weekday versus a weekend.  Have you ever tried to go on a Saturday?  I can easily switch these days around if you think a Saturday would be fine.  July 18:  The website I was using to plan some of the daily itineraries suggested Ginkakuji, but I will definitely look into switching it to Kinkakuji.  July 23:  Just added Osaka Castle and Umeda Sky building to my itinerary.   Thanks!"
JapanTravel,39651l,saytseff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"No problem! Always glad to help :)  July 14: Sorry I've never been to the actual auction itself. I have heard from friends that have gone, though, that it's getting increasingly hard to get into the auction. I don't know if weekdays have better chances. I think this may be a question for the reddit community.   July 18: ya tbh ginkakuji is really lackluster and not very exciting. Not that it's ugly or anything, just not as glamorous as Kinkakuji is. You'll know what I mean when you google them. Of course, Kinkakuji will probably be full of tourists when you do visit. But it's worth it if you've never seen it in person before."

If you're in the Shinkan building, ask for a room on the top floor for the best views."

I also would like to climb Mt. Fuji on my trip. I've just started learning Japanese, although I already know certain words, phrases and customs, I want to be able to at least know basic communication before I visit.  I plan on giving the major cities further out a miss, as I will most likely be staying in Tokyo for the duration of my visit.  I would have liked to visit some onsen, but due to my tattoos, I find it highly unlikely that I would be allowed entry unless I try one of the private onsen that specifically allow them.  As for aesthetics, thats more there for anyone else who comes across this. I personally don't mind.  I'll pop the extra information in."
JapanTravel,396qqb,ukatama,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're climbing Fuji, the mountain is only open from July to August (early September for some routes/huts).  So you'd need to prioritize."

Fuji is like 2 hours away from Tokyo Train station if I recall it correctly.  I think they have some type of festival or event every Sunday in Harajuku (the park close to it), atleast according to a girl who worked at the hostel I stayed in in Tokyo.  In Japan the season changes a lot, if you like fall then go in the fall, if you like winter, go in the winter.  There are always tourists in Japan, you probably wont get away from them."
JapanTravel,396qqb,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"Cheapest time to visit: From what I can already tell, it's usually October, but I'm not sure.   End of Autumn until before the ski season starts is generally the cheapest   Best time to see famous festivals and other events:   Depends on the festival. February for the Ice sculptures in Sapporro, Sanji Matsuri is in The first half of the year, I forget when though. Cherry Blossom season also has several festivals associated with it all over the country.   No 'one' time of year for this because they occur almost uniformly across the calendar Apart from that cheao late autumn, early winter period, which is the cheapest.    Least amount of other tourists (I'm English and one thing we tourists dislike, it's other tourists):   You'll need to venture out from the big cities like Tokyo and Kyoto. Once you do, foreign tourists are rare relatively speaking. In areas outside of the big tourist hubs you usually only see foreing tourists at big attraction like the Boiling Valley, Miyajima or whereever.   Having said that, domestic tourism is pretty big in Japan so 'Tourists' are everywhere :p. I assume you mean foreigners though   Best season to visit aesthetically:   Pick one.  I personally love the winter snows the most. Autumn is breathtaking too with the golden brown leaves and colours of the temple gardens. Autumn is also the most comfortable weatherwise. Spring has Cherry blossoms too, but you either have to book ahead and hope you got the dates right as the climate changes a little each year affecting the blooming, or book when it's easier to predict and pay a lot more. Summer has lots of festivals and fireworks and is really fun as well with lots of events and smaller celebrations."
JapanTravel,396qqb,Gurtang,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"Sadly the best time to visit Japan for 2 of the things you want (festivals and Mt Fuji) is also the worst time for weather and aesthetics.  I'd advise you too look into the following seasons :   1) Autumn colors season. There will be many japanese tourists but not too many foreigners. It's usually late november for the main areas (Tokyo/Kyoto) : http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014_when.html  And it's not as sudden as the cherry blossoms so it's more easily enjoyed.  2) Winter : January to march is a good time to see snow in Japan. You can easily enjoy onsen in the snow. Japanese winter is usually blessed with pretty clear weather so you have a better chance at seeing Mt Fuji in his full awesomeness (it's really more beautiful covered in snow than almost all black in summer). And that's a very low season, tourists-wise, so less people and better prices.  3) Spring. Cherry blossoms of course... but if the weather is bad or the timing a little wrong, you can miss it (the blossoms last like a week). And there are loaaaads of tourists, japanese and foreigners.  Basically, if you avoid the end of year holidays, july-august, and golden week (late april/early may), prices should be fine. You can also add late november and early april to that list but these are the best times aesthetically...   Also, if you can, don't stay in Tokyo, it's really a shame to come to Japan and only see Tokyo. Spend a few days there and move around a little, even if it's just to spend a few days in the second most well-known place, Kyoto."
JapanTravel,396qqb,wuerworm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:56:39 2015 UTC,"https://www.google.com/flights/ use this to see when flights are the cheapest for you There are festivals during every season, for different areas. For example, up north in tohoku and hokkaido, there are lots of snow-related festivals. From my experience living in the central area, most festivals take place during summer and leading into fall, lots of fireworks, religious, food themed festivals.  Least amount of tourists would be summer, I'd say.  My favorite time to visit would definitely be the cliche Spring time for the cherry blossoms. It is, however, crazy crowded and tickets can be very expensive."
JapanTravel,397g9z,fat_cat_lombardi,3,Tue Jun 9 20:19:49 2015 UTC,Kyoto is my suggestion. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2158.html If you decide to include Kyoto then I would probably consider a 7-day JR Pass. If you plan on staying in Nagoya then you will need to book your accommodation well in advance as Nagoya will sell out on that weekend. Note that the JR Pass does give you some flexibility in that regard so you could consider staying somewhere else and just day tripping to Nagoya if you can't find anything available/in your budget in Nagoya.

JapanTravel,397g9z,david_131,3,Tue Jun 9 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd include some general tips for the F1. Hopefully that will be somewhat useful for you!    Have you already purchased tickets? Which grandstand do you plan on using? Note that there are no general admission tickets for the race, they are all grandstand although some are just a section on a grassy slope. We purchased through the official site but obviously there are a number of other agents.     General Suzuka info and access:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4325.html    We used the normal JR trains to Suzuka Ino Circuit station. There was no big signage in Nagoya station for F1 fans so we just made our way to the required platform and hopped on the next available train. Ask the station staff if you are unsure. At busy times you may have to skip the first one and wait for the next one. If you are using a JR Pass you pay the small supplement fee at Suzuka Ino Circuit station when you arrive, they have two separate queues, those with normal tickets and those with JR Passes and the like that have to pay the supplement.    The walk from Suzuka Ino Circuit Station to the race track is not short (15-20 min), and is up hill. How long depends a bit on where you are picking your tickets up from/who you purchased from.    Once the day has finished and you walk back to Suzuka Ino Circuit Station there will be two queues, one going to Nagoya (North), the other one going to Tsu (South). In general the Nagoya one is the longer one but ask if you are unsure. When we left on the Saturday this was banked up for a couple of km outside the station and we queued for a bit over an hour to get on a train back to Nagoya.    There were a few of us in our group, and we arrived at different times and took different methods (some went Kintetsu trains and then by bus), but in general we all agreed that catching the train to Suzuka Ino Circuit and walking was the best method.    Book your F1 tickets, and accommodation as early as possible. Note that there are no General Admission passes, but you can buy the cheapest ""grandstand"" pass which tends to be a spot on the grass on the hill, and you can then walk around the circuit from there.    We went for a ride on the Ferris Wheel which was well worth it, buy your ticket for the ride from the vending machine at the base of the Wheel. Note that the Ferris Wheel is technically ""outside"" the circuit so you must have your ticket on you so you can re-enter the circuit precinct.    The souvenir shops are scattered around the circuit and there is one major one near the main entrance. Buy your souvenirs early (ie. on Friday) as they may sell out of whatever you want.     If you want to take photos/view from different areas of the circuit do this on Friday as there is essentially no reserved seating for the Friday. On the Saturday you can still move around a bit especially if you just want to take a few photos. On Sunday it is much harder to move as you pretty much have to take your assigned seat. You can't even walk to the top of the grandstand and take photos from there in general.    Beer was priced at 500 yen for a 500ml can, food was reasonably priced too with five yakitori skewers for 500 yen, and six Takoyaki for 600yen. They also had beef yakitori, fried noodles, and a good variety of other food.    In order to avoid the queues for the trains, and because the food was so good, we actually stayed back after the race on Sunday and drank beer and ate food for a couple of hours before heading back to Nagoya. They also replay the whole race on the big screens in front of the main grandstand/pit area, so you can go and sit in the grandstand and watch the race again on the big screen if you like, even if you didn't have a ticket for that grandstand.    While you are in Nagoya, if you want to do the Toyota Factory Tour then book well in advance as I would guess the English tour books up a bit around the F1 race dates. It takes a bit of time to travel to Toyotashi to do the tour, but the japan-guide page and the Toyota Reservation page explain it all fairly well. If you don't have time to do the actual factory tour then the other Toyota Museums in Nagoya are both worth a visit. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3308.html  If you don't want to deal with travelling back and forth to Nagoya then you can consider staying in Tsu, just bear in mind it is a smaller town with not as much to offer, but quite a few fans do stay there each year too.  Not sure what country you are from or if you wanted to meet others from your country but foreigners will stick out a mile at Suzuka so it is usually pretty easy to find other people from your country if you wish."

JapanTravel,395fcg,threepw00d,5,Tue Jun 9 11:29:42 2015 UTC,"If you like onsens, Kinosaki is a really relaxing way to spend a day. It's a small town near the sea with 7 public bathhouses, and you can get a daypass to all 7 for like $10.   Great seafood, soak in a few different onsens, take the cable-car up the nearby mountain. When I went there weren't many other foreign tourists and it was a nice way to get away from Osaka and Kyoto and Nara which were just packed with people."

JapanTravel,395fcg,Megafritz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yes Miyajima is one of my favourite places. I haven't been to Himeji since the castle reopened, so that's a possibility. cheers!"

JapanTravel,3971i5,wuerworm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:47:28 2015 UTC,"July 11 - Kyoto (Tentative Day Trip to Miyajima Island)   Tbis is about 5 hours travel to do return in one day.   Hakone is a resort town and you really only need one night to get there early on the first day and do the freepass stuff on the ropeway and all that, spend the night in onsen and carry on the next day. Then you have time to spend a night in Hiroshima and get more time on Miyajima.   Having been to all those places, thats what I'd suggest anyway, but I dislike spending so much time in travel on one day.   As you say the trip is tentative and you can't change your hotels so maybe consider a day trip to Nara, only an hour away.   I've hired WiFi from japan-wireless.com twice. Connect multiple devices to the wifi, comes with a back up battery and they will send it to your first hotel to pick up at check in, with and envelope for you to drop in a post box on your way to the airport at the end of your trip.   Fast speeds, unlimited data.   I'd highly encourage you learn some of the basic phrases for Japanese too. Ohaiyo, Konnichiwa and Konbanwa (Good Morning, Good afternoon (After about 11am) and good evening). Sumimassen (Pardon me, excuse me. Both in the sense of getting attention and apologising)   It makes a big difference for endearing yourself to the locals. Also, Hakone is not nearly as prolific with English as the other cities you are visiting. If you have a WiFi booked maybe start checking out some phrase guide book apps."
JapanTravel,3971i5,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the wifi tips! Sounds perfect.  Yeah, the travel within the country is locked in, so we can't modify how long we're in Hakone; I think I'm planning on just getting there as late as we can check in to the ryokan to maximize time in Tokyo.  I think I don't fully understand your first point, but you're saying it's about 5 hours roundtrip travel time from Kyoto to Miyajima?"
JapanTravel,3971i5,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"It's about 1 hour 45 minutes to get from Kyoto Station to Hiroshima station.  25 minutes from JR Hiroshima station to the station near the ferry port  10 minutes then for the ferry.   That's 2 hours and 20 minutes in each direction, not accounting for the time it takes to transfer between these services. So by the time you do account for switching from the Shinkansen, to local train and the to Ferry you'll be travelling for over 2.5 hours just to land on the Isalnd.  You then have to turn around and do that again to get back to Kyoto. So in total, you'll spend about 5+ hours travelling which only about 5-7 hours to spare on the Island  Just seems like a long way to go when there are some really nice locales like Nara much closer. More time exploring, less time in transport"
JapanTravel,3971i5,HeadBrainiac,2,Wed Jun 10 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"Nara is definitely worth visiting. A huge temple with an enormous Buddha statue, and tame deer roaming the parks waiting for you to buy deer biscuits to feed them. I loved it."
JapanTravel,3971i5,HeadBrainiac,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:56:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input (and /u/Vagabond_Sam as well). So you'd recommend just skipping Miyajima and doing Nara or something instead?
JapanTravel,3971i5,Vagabond_Sam,2,Wed Jun 10 04:22:37 2015 UTC,We didn't go to Miyajima so I can't speak to that. Just wanted to say that Nara was good. We did Fushimi Inari and Nara on the same day if you are looking for other ideas. I also can recommend a visit to the snow monkey sanctuary (http://travel.cnn.com/ireport-hanging-out-kyotos-macaques-718176). They are cute as all get-out.

JapanTravel,3971i5,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"I would do Nara instead.  Miyajima is likely the most beautiful place I've been to in Japan, but you'll struggle to have enough time there to really enjoy it. I think despite my claims to it's beauty, you'll have a better time over all in Nara which by all accounts is beautiful and widely considered a must visit destination.   Disclaimer, I haven;t been to Nara so just basing it off what choice I'd choose."

JapanTravel,3970lj,charade_scandal,2,Tue Jun 9 19:25:30 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Plenty of time. The flights back to Canada are early afternoon and was wondering if it was similar for you and you would have to be up at 5:30 AM or something.  Yeah I think you've have a nice simple plan where you hit all the important stuff but don't have totally jammed days.
JapanTravel,3970lj,wuerworm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"November 9: What time are you arriving at NRT on the first day? Because it takes about 90 minutes to get from NRT into Tokyo proper, and I don't know how much time you'll have to explore Shinjuku. Also, you'll be jet lagged, so you'll get tired and really sleepy around late afternoon (if you're from the west coast US, earlier if you're east coast)  November 9: There's not that much do at the Imperial Palace, because you can't enter the premise. If I may make a suggestion for a night time activity, look up the Metropolitan Government Building Observatory and check out the awesome night view of Tokyo city for free."
JapanTravel,3970lj,wuerworm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:22:51 2015 UTC,We get in at 5pm and we're hoping we'll get lots of sleep on the plane ride and just force ourselves to push through the tiredness.. but maybe I'll rework that day to make it more realistic.   I'll definitely check that out - thank you for the suggestion!
JapanTravel,396zyk,drcorndog,2,Tue Jun 9 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"This is crazy, seriously. You will spend countless hours in train just to ""enjoy"" a few hours in a very fast paced visit, then you will have to go back for the night.  You can easily spend 2 days in Hakone and forget Nikko (or opposite, I don't know about current volcano activity in Hakone, but I think they closed a part of the cable car). Place is still awesome tho.  Kamakura is doable in a (long) day and nice to visit.  Why do you want to go to Hiroshima? At best you will arrive in the end of afternoon and not have time to see anything, even more so if you decide to go to Miyajima on the next day.  I would settle in Kyoto or Osaka from 10 to 13. You can still go to Okayama and come back to Tokyo on the 13.   Also, I would not come back on the same day as your flight, even more if it is in the afternoon. Narita is far from Tokyo and with airport planning, you will have to leave early from Kyoto, hoping nothing bad happens on the way."
JapanTravel,396zyk,sinston_wmith,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:48:50 2015 UTC,"I thought it was ambitious, but doable. The longest shinkansen ride would be roughly 4 hours from Tokyo to Hiroshima and I'd leave early for each train trip. I did think about ditching on Kyoto for next time to allow myself plenty of time between Okayama and getting back to Tokyo.  I want to see Hiroshima because I'm very much into IR and history. Plus Miyajima seems amazing. I have plenty of time and have a lot of flexibility of options still (the exception being Okayama for the concert), so I am interested in more feedback like this."

JapanTravel,3955ux,laryrose,4,Tue Jun 9 09:57:59 2015 UTC,"You're literally going to a new place nearly every day.   If you're questioning whether or not it's too fast paced to keep up, it most likely is. In this case, it most definitely is. You will NOT enjoy your trip."
JapanTravel,3955ux,RealArc,3,Tue Jun 9 11:33:49 2015 UTC,Give your parents and yourself some room to breathe. Nikko is nice and everything but imho skipable with the rest of your itinerary. As another redditor suggested also skip hakone. Fuji san is pretty difficult to see anyways in summer and with the rope way closed... Not ideal.
JapanTravel,3955ux,RealArc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:36:47 2015 UTC,"Mt. Fuji is difficult to see in summer? I would imagine is the best time, because it should not be cloudy (as opposed to rainy spring or typhoon season)."

JapanTravel,3955ux,mybigleftnut,2,Tue Jun 9 10:46:14 2015 UTC,"Something to consider, the main ""tourist"" places, especially in Tokyo seemed very ""touristy"" to me. If they're ok with things like that great, otherwise, the smaller things may end up being just as enjoyable.  Another option would be to split up, somewhere in the middle, or on 1/3's of the trip, find somewhere they can stay/rest or have a relaxing day and go elsewhere on your own. Maybe co-incide with yourself taking day trips to other places like Nikko? I'm thinking an onsen or some other resort-style area."

JapanTravel,3952vk,Ivytiu,3,Tue Jun 9 09:11:51 2015 UTC,"Typhoons, when they do hit, and depending on the size, can be hellish, causing flooding, cancellations to flights, delays to trains and sometimes stoppage altogether. It's sideways rain, so umbrellas aren't all that useful. The day after is always beautiful, though."
JapanTravel,3952vk,ukatama,3,Tue Jun 9 09:54:50 2015 UTC,"The weather in August is pretty awful, however, a lot of really neat festivals occur then, so if you want to do some things really cool outside of a typical Tokyo - Kyoto - Tokyo trip, that would be the best time to come.   In September the weather is slightly better, but, to me, there's not nearly as many interesting things going on, and it's too early for the leaves to change colors, so, again, to me, I wouldn't recommend for anyone to come then."
JapanTravel,3952vk,sosayeth,2,Tue Jun 9 11:31:38 2015 UTC,"I went from late August to late September. I think it depends on the typhoon situation and in which part of Japan you are. I was in the Tokyo area in August and it was very humid, but not unbearable. After that (September) I went to Kyoto and down to Kyushu and it was pleasantly hot with mostly blue summer days. Back in Tokyo it rained mostly because of the typhoon."
JapanTravel,3952vk,Meganebashi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"1) These are really things that you can't really control. Maybe you can decide based on the flight prices.   2) Typhoons are completely up to mother nature. But when they do occur, they are very windy and very wet.   3)Often work and school get canceled. People are urged to stay home when typhoons hit. I'm not trying to scare you, just trying to give you an idea of how bad it can get. Hopefully you don't meet any typhoons!  When I lived in Japan, I actually didn't really feel much of any of the typhoons that came by. So don't worry too much about it."
JapanTravel,395tk1,sosayeth,3,Tue Jun 9 13:43:38 2015 UTC,"The shinkansen is spacious, comfortable, and fast. Buses are slow, cramped, and uncomfortable. Good luck actually sleeping on one.  The 7 day rail pass is an absolute steal at $230. If you plan your trip right, you can see a large portion of the country with it and really make the most out of your time in Japan. Taking the bus only makes sense if you have loads of free time and very little money.  Taking the shinkansen from Nagoya to Tokyo takes under two hours compared to five for the bus. Rather than being able to travel and start exploring your destination on the same day, by the time you factor in getting to your hotel, you've wasted an entire day traveling. I really don't think the highway buses make sense for most visitors.  The best way to use it is to fly into one city, spend several days there, activate the pass, visit several more cities and go to the final city where you'll fly out from on the last day of the pass."
JapanTravel,395tk1,chazchaz101,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"I am in complete agreement with you, and at times I have seriously contemplated the pros and cons of faking a Rail Pass, just because of its massive convenience, haha! (I wouldn't really do that, though.)   Despite its undoubted convenience, however, according to the (very minute amount of) information I've found, it seems that the vaaaast majority of travelers do in fact choose to forgo the purchase of a Rail Pass, though I could not find any reasons as to why."
JapanTravel,395tk1,jamar030303,2,Wed Jun 10 11:59:39 2015 UTC,"Past (and future, but I think you meant ""future"" as in ""first-time"") traveler here, do note that I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who frequently (4-6 trips a year?) visits but never for more than a week at a time:   That being said, for those of you who have traveled here already and either used the JR Rail Pass or paid for your bullet train tickets by trip, what are your feelings on traveling through Japan by bullet train?    Note: I usually buy my shinkansen tickets per trip. I've gotten a JR East Pass before, but not a regular JR Pass because I couldn't see the value.  Well, it's kinda pricey. Hard to avoid that, even when buying tickets from the discount shops. To me, it's also a toss-up between it and air travel for the kinds of trips I do within Japan. I usually arrive with an itinerary in mind. I've got a couple of days to a week, hit the sights I want to see, the shopping I want to get done, or the usual hangouts I want to go to, then continue on. (yes, my frequent visits are all stopovers between the US and China)   Of course it's nice to arrive in parts of the country you'd like to see as quickly as possible, but would you have been more inclined to take more side-trips or day trips to lesser-traveled areas, or going at a slower pace and seeing more non-touristy places, if you had the option?   Not really, though this could quite likely be the fact that I go a lot and for short periods of time. If I wanted to go on a side-trip to a smaller city I usually have the option of flying into the smaller city first (I usually fly EVA Air into or out of the country when I want to do this, they serve quite a few Japanese destinations) and then taking a train or plane onwards to my final destination. For example, flying into Komatsu, buying a one-way ticket to Osaka or Tokyo, then leaving from there, or doing the reverse.    Also, having been on a bullet train and knowing the convenience experience (in terms of comfort and speed,) would you be more or less against the idea of traveling on a bus, especially an overnight one?   More. I've never been a fan of long-distance buses, especially traveling overnight. I'd rather do a short, quick trip during the day rather than spend a long time on or attempt to sleep on a bus seat. Also, traffic is an issue that affects the roads more than it does the rails or the air   What if, over a two week trip, for example, instead of spending $350 - $400, plus extra on subways and non-JR local buses, on a JR Rail Pass, you had spent $200-$250 total on buses, local trains, and subways... would the savings have been worth it to you?   N/A- even the one time I bought a JR East Pass I managed to keep it below $250 so I'm the wrong person to ask on this one."
JapanTravel,395tk1,jamar030303,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thorough response. One more quick question, it sounds to me like money is not really a concern for you when it comes to traveling with Japan? Seeing that you are a frequent visitor, do you think your particular method of flying into and proceeding to travel from smaller cities would be a feasible option for younger travelers or those who are basing their trip around a tight budget? I've only ever flown into Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, mostly internationally, and so I'm not too familiar with domestic airfare within Japan."
JapanTravel,3947s4,imtotallydoingmywork,2,Tue Jun 9 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"Are onsens (baths using natural hot spring water, as opposed to plain baths) important? If so, Hakone.  Not sure you'll have a lot of choices as a solo traveler though."

Depending on the time you have and if you have a JR pass or not, it can be a good choice. (I haven't checked the rates for a single traveler in early october.)  I've been there in the snow, it won't be like that in early october but may have nice autumn colors already, since it's in the mountain :)  Hakone is cool too, I've been to Yuugiriso, good value, but the onsen is of course nothing like Takaragawa.  Kyoto is not known for hot springs, so if it's something you want to check out I'd advise Hakone (and of course even better Takaragawa)."

It would be 3 hours of train for 3000 yen to Minakami (one way), then you'd have to take a bus for about 30 mns. The best thing is to be picked-up at Minakami by the hotel shuttle but there's only one at 3pm.  One night for one person with dinner and breakfast goes for about 225USD, on booking.com"

JapanTravel,397dey,c0ndu,4,Tue Jun 9 20:01:41 2015 UTC,if it's possible to move to work there if I pass a language exam.   You'd at the very least have to re-take the physician licensing tests in Japanese (complete with all the medical terminology). I'm not sure how you'll be able to get through medical school AND learn Japanese to that level of a proficiency in 3-4 years.
JapanTravel,397dey,geekpondering,0,Tue Jun 9 20:14:43 2015 UTC,Do you have any other knowledge regarding the physician licensing test? What does it cover also what level do I need for the language test?
JapanTravel,397dey,laryrose,2,Tue Jun 9 21:12:40 2015 UTC,I'd imagine that you'd need near fluency. Why would any hospital hire a foreign physician who isn't completely fluent in Japanese when they can hire a Japanese physician who has studied English?
JapanTravel,397dey,ukatama,0,Tue Jun 9 21:37:57 2015 UTC,Well I personally don't know how is the status of physicians in Japan(if they have too many or are in need) also about how many years does it take to become a fluent japanese speaker if you really get down to it? 3-4 years is roughly?
JapanTravel,397dey,laryrose,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"Which country are you from? Not an English speaking one I can tell. If you're Chinese, I guess it would be easier, but I'd put it at around 2 years of devoted study and immersion, 10 if you're doing on the side."
JapanTravel,397dey,geekpondering,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"It would be like maybe four years if that's all you're studying at school, perhaps.  Significantly longer to obtain fluency in a medical field. It's hard enough to be a physician in your native language..."
JapanTravel,397dey,wuerworm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"Do you have any other knowledge regarding the physician licensing test?   I actually have no knowledge regarding physician licensing. I do know that Japan has a program for nurses to come over from 'cheap labor' countries like the Philippines, allows them to work for a year, and then requires them to pass the Japanese nursing exam, which is in Japanese. This has caused a revolving-door program where nurses come over from other countries and are promptly kicked out when they can't pass the exam due to lack of language ability.   I can't imagine physician licensing would be any easier than the nursing cert process. If you are really interested in it, I'd maybe consult an immigration attorney to look into it for you."

JapanTravel,3948fv,RavingRunner,3,Tue Jun 9 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"Don't go back to Tokyo, then back to Hiroshima. You should make a round trip, for instance Tokyo - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Osaka - Matsumoto - Tokyo.  I'd make the Mt Fuji hike a 2-day trip from Tokyo, not included in other travels, in order to risk less fatigue. But maybe you can fit it in well."
JapanTravel,3948fv,Gurtang,2,Tue Jun 9 04:26:37 2015 UTC,I agree. It doesn't make sense to spend more than one period in each place. You'll waste a lot of time and effort hauling luggage around and checking in and out of hotels.
JapanTravel,3948fv,chazchaz101,2,Tue Jun 9 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"I guess it's because he wants to be back for the Summer Sonic festival, but it's still pretty pointless. My advice is to stay in Tokyo until the festival is over (maybe with side trips to Nikko, Hakone, Yokohama etc.) and then travel westwards."
JapanTravel,3948fv,adam_364,3,Tue Jun 9 08:53:44 2015 UTC,"Like others have mentioned, there is no point to travel so much to/from Tokyo. You can stay in Tokyo (as in sleep in Tokyo) until the music festival while visiting tons of places around. I knwo because I did exactly that.  It is easy to have day trips (going in the morning and coming back at night). Some places you can do that, which I did, are Nikko, Kamakura, Mt. Fuji climb.  For Mt. Fuji climb, I until midday and got to the 5th station about 8pm or so. Then I started climbing around 11pm and got to the top around 4am or something like that. (there is a LOT of people so it is hard to go faster). Then you can watch the sunrise, rest a little, or even sleep, and then take the day to climb down and return to Tokyo, or go somewhere near. The good thing about this is that you won't need to pay for that night hotel. I left my bags in a locker in Shinjuku station and got them the day after. Just an idea.  Also when going to Kyoto, you could go to famous places near, specially Nara. The first capital of Japan with the biggest oldest temple, and lots of deer. Also Himeji is near Kyoto, Osaka.  I think is good you have a lot of days that will give you flexibility in case you want to do something not planned. So just try to be efficient with your train rides."
JapanTravel,3948fv,a2ms,2,Tue Jun 9 09:53:56 2015 UTC,I feel like you're spending too much time in Tokyo. Maybe spare a day or two for Osaka and Kobe? I've heard good stuff about Osaka's aquarium and Kobe's night view

I had no reservation and managed to get a seat because I was solo, but I'm sure you could reserve a spot a couple nights before. The place is actually in Shinjuku, on the 7th floor of the Keio Plaza Hotel (Between Shinjuku station and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building).  It was slightly more expensive than your price range at dinner time (around $120ish for Omakase + sake), but I thought it was completely worth it."

And it's not close to the train station, I'd get a cab (relatively cheap, like 1500 yen, 10 minutes). There are usually many cabs at Kawaguchiko station (unless you arrive really late at night).

Nonbe Yokocho in Tateishi is quite small, there are only a handful of places to drink and eat. It is also way less touristy, way less international (you'll be hard pressed to find a mama speaking English there, and without a bit of Japanese you might feel quite lost) and overall less crowdy. Some of the joints are probably just closed. There is a half-famous yakitori joint, but you would not want to visit the area for the food. Be aware that it's quite out of the way from regular tourist areas."

From Takaoka you can take the train to Toyama which leaves at 9:50 and arrives at 10:33. Or the one after that which leaves 10:22 and arrives 11:17.  From Toyama, take the 12:34 train (Alpine Route) to arrive at Tateyama around 13:40. You should be able to end up at Shinano-Omachi at 17:35. Trains leave from there to Matsumoto at 18:02, 19:02 and 20:07 (1h10 travel time)."

JapanTravel,38z133,chazchaz101,5,Mon Jun 8 01:19:05 2015 UTC,I take a pretty relaxed approach to advance trip planning. I generally choose an area or two for the day and note any specific things I think look interesting. I only put specific times when there's something that requires more precise timing like an infrequent bus or a restaurant/event reservation. That way I can easily spend more or less time at each place depending on whether I find them interesting.

JapanTravel,38z133,corialis,4,Mon Jun 8 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"I like just picking an area and assigning it to a day. I research enough in advance that I have an idea how much time I'd spend in an area. I could spend forever in Shibuya, Harajuku and Shinjuku so they get full days. I keep a note of what specific things I'd like to see in an area, but I don't like making specific times because what if I see something interesting on the way? Unless you're going to a specific event, whatever you're trying to see will still be there in an hour.   If that's still too open for you, make a 'Must Do - Wanna Do - Don't Wanna Do' list. This is especially handy when traveling with others because you can cross-reference. If you have 2 Must Dos and 2 Wanna Dos in an area, schedule the Must Dos and fill the rest of the time with Wanna Dos. If something comes up and you have to abandon a Wanna Do, you won't be upset.   If I had scheduled the crap out of my afternoon in Shimokitazawa, I wouldn't have stumbled upon the most adorable cat cafe in the world (Cateriam) while trying to find a place to pee."

JapanTravel,38z133,Cub3h,2,Mon Jun 8 10:12:01 2015 UTC,Currently in japan right now. I booked this vacation less then 3 weeks before departure. So I tried to do the whole excel spread sheet thing and ABC planning but it's hard to do on short notice and rainy season weather.  So I am sort of winging it as I go but have a general idea on what to do. I read alot on japan guide and on this subreddit. I have activities planned but adapt my days. For example it was not going to rain 2 days ago so we decided on kyoto over himeji castle since we thought it was more important to go during clear weather. Also decided to do nara today instead of kyoto because of cloudy and rainy weather.  So my strategy on this last minute trip so far is use the knowledge I have from research and adapt. Also triposo\TripAdvisor  have helped out for top destinations in each area.  It's hard to do a ABC schedule in general because shit always comes up imo. But kudos to those who do it and I admire them because I never could do it.  Ps: if you use TripAdvisor don't follow their food recommendations. I lost it when pizza was osaka highest rating.  I'm a foodie so trying certain foods was more important then all these temples and shrines lol.
JapanTravel,38z133,templarTa,2,Tue Jun 9 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"I usually find the places that look interesting, star them on google maps and then plan out days by things that are closer together.

The districts that were less interesting to me I grouped together in the same block. - in each district, prioritized events/restos/stores/sights - in each district/city, marked down local specialties - with the exception of a handful of places I wanted to eat, I left the meals fairly flexible because we were rarely not near something we couldn't afford. - for specific (read: nerdy) shopping I usually allocate a whole day at least in a specific district :P go for broke!  I always planned by hour, or by chunk of hours because you never know what will happen (getting lost, delay in travel etc) and for me, it's hard to enjoy a vacation when you know you're on a timer.

That does not mean however that I tried to see everything and rush through. Almost every time I left something unticked in each city, but at least I had enough possibilities there.   On the other hand, there's going to be certain places where you have to keep a scheduled itinerary, be it because of infrequent buses/trains or because a certain attraction closes earlier or special events that only take place at a certain time.  As for meals, I usually don't plan those in advance and eat whenever I am hungry and at no specific place"
JapanTravel,38z133,macphile,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"Based on not only my own, but the majority of other itineraries I've seen here, I don't know if a Day Planner style template would be as useful as an overall trip itinerary template.  Generally speaking, my itinerary was based around a ""home base"" where I'd stay for several days, and a list of things to do each day.  I didn't want to get TOO specific with each day, because I wanted to leave in gaps for unplanned events (transit troubles, weather, etc).  I more or less just came up with a list of things to do, or a specific area to visit, like ""Day Trip -- Kamakura""."
JapanTravel,38z133,einar77,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"I don't plan in specific time slots except where a particular train or reservation enters into it, but I've written up what I intend to do on each day. I also note good restaurants in the area, stuff like that.   Things get really specific on one part of my trip, as I'll need to take an hour-long train ride to a small town and then get out of that town again in time to get to Osaka and fully explore Dotonbori that evening. The train between the two is like 3.5 hours long. Most of my trip isn't as tight, but I've still noted the train times and intend to take the morning ones (and possibly reserve them) so I can maximize my time.  I was hoping to find an app that would let me organize my information exactly as I wanted, but I gave up. Right now, a lot of the information is stored in Box. I have a master list of the names and addresses of everywhere I plan to go (along with recommended places), in both languages. I've also stored all of those in Maps on my phone (or Google Maps, I forget) so I can pull them up and use them for GPS navigation when I'm on foot."

Where it's been useful like this is when I plan in advances stuff like where to eat (someone in the group is very apt in getting good places), so I can figure out how much we have to walk / go."

Given the dollar has strengthened about 20% over the past year against the Yen it may be a good time to lock in some of the costs. You could hedge against a weaker dollar by doing some now assuming you can do so at a good exchange rate. The current rate hovering around ¥125 is the highest in at least the last 5 years from the charts I've looked at.  If I were certain of my trip, I'd probably accumulate a portion of my budget every few months assuming I didn't have a better place to stash the cash for a high return."
JapanTravel,38yzni,mike932,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"If you buy yen now, and you don't go on your trip, just convert it back to US dollars in the US.  In other words, you don't have to go to Japan in order to invest in Yen."

Also, at least in the US, the actual rate you can get buying cash is a lot worse than the rate you'd get from an ATM in Japan. If you really want to save money, look into getting a card that doesn't have a foreign transaction fee. Some cards charge you upwards of 3%."

JapanTravel,38wh9w,Simplezz,2,Sun Jun 7 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"I just did Japan ""on the cheap"" for 14 days. I took about $700 US and that was just about the right amount for me. I skipped a lot of public transportation where I couldn't use my JR pass and either walked (a lot) or rented a bike. I ate cheaply, convenience store food for breakfast, light lunch and a reasonable dinner, with nearly no souvenir purchases.  I don't know about Tokyo, since I didn't spend much time there at all, but a lot of attractions around Japan seemed to cost 100-500 yen to enter, so depending on how many you go to that could add up. Bus/subway trips have been 200-300 yen each from what I've seen, but some places have all-day passes that you might look into if you'll be using them heavily.  I think I averaged ~300 yen for a light breakfast, maybe 500-800 for lunch, then around 1000 for dinner. I don't drink alcohol, so I didn't spend any money on that, which helps.  Considering the exchange rate for the pound, I would say that 700 is a little on the low side for two people, especially if you need to pay for a place to stay still. My cheap-o budget worked out to about: 2800(hostel)+300+500+1000(food)+2000(misc) = 6400 yen per day. Finding free attractions and avoiding public transportation could lower this number, but sometimes you just want to do that one cool thing and it's best to have some leeway in the budget.  tldr: I would up that number for two people. If it's just for you, then I think it's fine if you don't go crazy."

We spent 10 days in Kyoto with my son, who lives there. I'd recommend day trips to Nara and Kobe (try the Kobe beef if you can afford it -- it's to die for. Lunch is much cheaper than dinner) and a visit to the snow monkey sanctuary. For this last, wear good walking shoes and be prepared to ascend hundreds of feet on a steep path. I'm not trim and fit and it was a tough climb for me but the view and adorable monkeys were worth it in the end. Everything was accessible by JR.  We stayed two nights in a traditional ryokan in Kyoto: http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/ryokan-single/?ryokan=Nagomi+Ryokan+Yuu.  I really liked it. It was inexpensive but felt authentic. We had a room upstairs with a sloping ceiling from 8' by the room's entrance to ~3' at the window, with a hanging light fixture and massive beam in the middle of the room. This made it difficult to dress standing up, and we had to rearrange the furniture so our suitcases were accessible without having to crawl. When you book, you might want to ask for an all-one-height ceiling, especially if you and/or your brother is/are tall. But the private bathroom was modern and well-maintained. If you want and can afford a ryokan on bigger property than a paved side street, with multiple gardens, meals in rooms and shared baths, you can find a good selection at http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/ryokan-search-results/?area=Kyoto.   My son is 22 and likes Osaka for its nightlife. Kyoto is more sedate and traditional (lots of women in kimono). I had read and seen Memoirs of a Geisha so loved seeing Gion, the center of traditional geisha life in the 1800s and 1900s. Oh -- we also visited http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha because I had seen so many gorgeous pictures of it online. Bonus: millions of food stalls. (Same in Nara so you can eat your way to and from the giant Buddha.) If you like hiking, you can climb all the way to the top of the mountain in 2-3 hours ( orange gates all the way). We were going to Nara on the same day so we only spent an hour there.  You're smart to begin researching early. I thought I'd done a good job but was ill-prepared for Tokyo so we didn't spend our time wisely. Anyway, have a great time!"
JapanTravel,38sot4,HeadBrainiac,2,Sat Jun 6 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info about Kyoto and the ryoken website, really useful!"

JapanTravel,38sot4,turquoiseowl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:27:19 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've also been considering to go to Fushimi Inari Shrine and Nara on the same day, is it feasible? Did you just go to Fushimi Inari in the morning and stayed at Nara in the afternoon? How long did you stay in Nara?"
JapanTravel,38sot4,HeadBrainiac,2,Sun Jun 7 10:52:26 2015 UTC,"It was totally feasible. We caught the 11:00 train from the station near our downtown hotel and got to the shrine around 11:30, I think? (My memory is fuzzy since I wasn't navigating, we were just following our son like little ducklings.)  We spent about an hour there including eating some street food. (It's a 10-minute walk there from the train station too.) We only went to the end of the first ""tunnel."" It was definitely minimalist sightseeing but we had an agenda to maximize the day's activities.  We caught the 1:00ish express train to Nara. We spent maybe two hours in Nara leisurely walking through the temple (~half hour walk from the train station), eating soft serve, wading through the massive crowds, taking pictures, and petting the deer, of whom we only saw 8 or 9. (It was Golden Week and the place was mobbed. My son was shocked at how few deer there were compared to his prior visits but surmised they were all ""touristed out"" and had gone into hiding.)  We got back to Kyoto Station around 4:45 and went to the top of the Tower, then ate afterward at the beer-garden (pretty sure reservations are a must) -- all you can eat and drink for ¥3,000 each.   So we saw a lot that day. Of course it depends on how long you want to stay at each site but it was a good pace and amount of sightseeing for us. I am not a hiker or even in reasonable shape -- I have a desk job and am overweight, so in our first 5 days or so, it always took longer to walk somewhere than I care to admit. But I did get faster, with better stamina, over the course of our two weeks there!"
JapanTravel,38sot4,turquoiseowl,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"Wow that sounds great, seems like I'll save a day and combine fushimi inari and nara then! Could you also advise on where else you went in Kyoto? I'm thinking of spending 3 days there and I'm not v sure where else is fun other than Arashiyama and Fushimi Inari/Nara! I'm worried about getting temple fatigue!   Also, any other must go places in your japan trip? Thanks a lot!"
JapanTravel,38sot4,HeadBrainiac,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Sure! Snow monkey sanctuary was very cool.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwatayama_Monkey_Park As I said, it was a HUGE hike / climb and I had to stop a lot to rest. (Remember: sedentary; fat.) I could've spent an hour or more there but the others were ready to go after 20 minutes.  I'll have to get back to you on the names of the two shrines we visited. It may be a while cuz my son is working and hosting two former roommates from the USA in his off time. We only went to two temples. I wish we'd made it to the Golden Pavilion but we got lost on our only alone-day (my son's only work day) and wasted a lot of time walking aimlessly.   (Note -- in Tokyo few of the street signs were in English so we really had trouble getting around when looking for someplace specific! I recommend you get street maps in your native tongue before you get to Japan -- also bus, JR and subway maps. We finally cracked the code on the Tokyo metro system but the Kyoto bus stop schedules were confusing even for my son who is practically fluent. And we spent an hour in a 6-block radius looking for a Tokyo tempura restaurant by addressbefore asking in a shop. The place was literally 20 feet away but the sign was in kanji only.)  I think that's everywhere we went in Kyoto... I can pm you when I figure out the names of the temples. (Feel free to pm me if you don't hear from me in a week -- I'd hate to forget!)  I really liked the teramachi too! http://www.insidekyoto.com/teramachi-shinkyogoku-shopping-arcades-kyoto http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298564-d554673-Reviews-Teramachi-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html I was surprised to see what I'm sure were locals shopping there. (Including my son's friend who'd given us the tour of Gion the day before!)  We were pretty food-centric. My thin son and size-2 GF took us to all their favorite restaurants. I gained 5 pounds in 2 weeks despite all the walking becuz much of the food was fried. I don't know where you're from but I was surprised to see far fewer vegetables served than in the USA! And of course taking all public transit, we drank beer with every meal!  Edit: feel free to pm me if I forget to get back to you with the names of the temples! It should be about a week till my son has time to text me."
JapanTravel,38ukop,sinston_wmith,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"My vote would be for Okinawa. When I went a few years ago, it was beautiful in the main city of Naha and the weather was gorgeous. I can't speak for all Japanese, but I know my coworkers have said they've never been because it's generally too expensive to travel there for holiday. I can't vouch for the weather though, and I know it's a higher chance of typhoons in September (knock on wood that neither of us have that problem because I'll be there then too!) but I feel like the positives (going for, say, 3 days and having great weather and a great time together), will heavily outweigh the negatives (skipping it because of the potential for typhoons, and just doing the same old thing for her 30th birthday)."
JapanTravel,38ucs1,RealArc,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:12:41 2015 UTC,A) don't count on sleeping B) public transportation generally stops around midnight and starts around 5 am. If the flight is around 6 am (really early for Narita imo) then no.
JapanTravel,38ucs1,amyranthlovely,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know that you can get back to Narita in time for your flight out if you leave? I think the trains stop running IN Tokyo around midnight, and I don't know for a fact that they start again before 5am. If I'm not mistaken (and I could be), you have to be back at the airport for two hours before an international flight, don't you? So if you leave at 9pm, you have a couple of hours to see a few things (mostly nightlife) until you have to have your butt back on a train back to the airport. Or, you leave at 9pm, train out, run around at night, find some late night bars or manga kissa to spend the night, then everyone pitches in for a cab back to Narita for 4:30am which could be way more expensive than the train.  I don't know, but I don't think it would work at all. :/  ETA: Keisei Skyliner doesn't leave any earlier than 5am, and it's still a 45 minute trip. Skidding in the door of the airport at 5:45 with a 6am takeoff time (?) means you may very well miss your flight. I wouldn't risk it."
JapanTravel,38ucs1,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"you won't be able to get back to the airport from Tokyo unless you're willing to drop like $200 on a taxi, and Narita is a small town that is as dead as a doornail at night."
JapanTravel,38ucs1,its_real_I_swear,2,Sat Jun 6 23:38:47 2015 UTC,I'm fine with getting a taxi. It's better than sitting in an airport terminal for 9 hours doing nothing.    What would you recommend for Tokyo?  The Tokyo tower looks pretty awesome.  Do you know of any Ramen shops that would be open?
JapanTravel,38ucs1,ukatama,2,Sun Jun 7 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything other than highlife stuff will be closed. Personally, I would probably go to shinjuku, walk around in kabukicho for awhile, and then have some drinks in one of the high up hotel bars where you can see the city lights"
JapanTravel,38t7ux,Nebuchadnezz4r,2,Sat Jun 6 16:44:38 2015 UTC,You probably should add at least 1 day to Kyoto.
JapanTravel,38t7ux,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:20:46 2015 UTC,You think there's enough to see and do? But to be honest I'm up for anything. I don't think I'll be bored.
JapanTravel,38t7ux,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:59:48 2015 UTC,There's a lot to see in Kyoto and note there's a good chance you'll do a day trip from there to Nara
JapanTravel,38t7ux,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:20:46 2015 UTC,"Alright day added. And I've been looking at Nara. Honestly, there's so many temples and shrines in Kyoto I don't even know where to start, even with Japan guide."
JapanTravel,38t7ux,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"this was my personal experience. Basically assuming you're starting at 9am you can probably see 3-4 temples a day. So even thought Japan-Guide's Eastern Kyoto shows you can do more I found that more time was required. Also note there are so many temples, some not even listed on Japan-Guide that you should do your own research.  For reference my first day in Kyoto I arrived at 11am checked in and was on the road around noon. I made it to the Golden temple, Nijo Castle and the bamboo forest then called it a day. The time required to get between locations took longer than expected on public transportation.  Day 2 I did the eastern all day via rented bikes but ended up only having time to see 4 places. Renting bikes was fun but finding proper bike parking was a pain at times.  I did a day trip to Miyajima/ Hiroshima but realistically speaking I should have done an over night.  I also did a day trip to Nara from Kyoto but by then I had seen so many temples I saw the one major draw and then left.  Koyasan was one of the highlights of my trip."
JapanTravel,38ssc3,LurkerNo527,2,Sat Jun 6 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"I took a bus from Kobe station to Tokushima about a month ago for Golden Week. It took about two and a half hours. There were multiple buses but I took the first. It was between 7 and 8 am and it cost me around 3000yen. It passes over the Akashi bridge as well. If you take an early train to Kobe you should be completely fine. It's a very doable trip. I dont know the exact time table but google maps will give you a simple and accurate train route to Kobe from either Kyoto or Osaka (Osaka being the fastest option) and then just search ""Kobe to Tokushima bus"" on google and you should get a couple different options. You can by your ticket online, in which case you just show the driver your reservation number on your phone , or you can by your ticket from the driver himself, as I did.  Hope this helps!"
JapanTravel,38ssc3,daddygonads,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"If it only takes 2.5 hours on the bus, that's definitely the way to go. The train takes almost 4 hours each way from Osaka and even longer from Kyoto, and it isn't cheap, either.  Also, keep in mind that there are different styles of dancing done during the day and at night, so you might be missing out if there isn't a late bus."
JapanTravel,38smt9,buitron,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:44:17 2015 UTC,I'm having a bit of trouble opening it up on my current computer but from what I see it looks like a good diverse plan.  There might be a couple tight days in Tokyo but if you get an early start it's certainly possible to do everything listed.   I'll write more when I can take a better look.

The gooey texture just wasn't tasty for me. I did quite enjoy Okonomiyaki though.  Oddly enough the best meal I had in Osaka was at an Italian restaurant. It came pretty close to what I had in Italy.

Once you step outside of big cities, you can rarely find Wi-Fi spots. Purchase prepaid SIM: I've done this and it worked just fine. There are several websites where you can purchase SIM in advance and pick up at airport or hotel. I've purchased one from here before, because it comes with discount tickets and the value worth more than SIM price: http://www.prepaid-sim-japan.com Rent a Wi-Fi router: recommended if you are traveling with others so that you can ""share"".

Just download a bunch of Viber type apps and you're good to go.  The other plus to this is if you plan to bring a laptop or tablet as well. Can connect with those. Especially useful if you don't want to use the Hotel's internet (a lot of them charge extra for it daily). In which case, a lot of them still tend to be on hard wired connections and don't offer wifi of any sort."

JapanTravel,38q928,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, the usual is a Kyoto/Tokyo axis. If you take a JR pass, you should push to Hiroshima/Miyajima.   There are also many things to see in other places, but it's still the best for a first timer.  So yeah, a few days in Kyoto, with day or 2-day trips to Hiroshima, Osaka, etc. + day trips from Tokyo too (Nikko, Kawaguchiko...) is good.  However, there wouldn't be much hiking. Unless you really go hike in the mountain, Japan is more of a public transportation country, especially in this megalopolis that runs along the Tokyo/Kyoto axis.  If you really want that and don't mind missing the most known stuff in Kyoto/Hiroshima, I guess you could go for Takayama/Kanazawa.  But note that september is typhoon season so I wouldn't set my mind on hiking.  Personaly, I feel like places like Nara, Miyajima, and the Kansai as a whole, offer a big contrast to Tokyo already."

I recommend taking the daibutsu hiking trail to the big buddha and then the beach. It's an awesome and unique hike that has a lot of interest to offer on the way.  And Kyoto is definitely a must see if you haven't been and have time. It's a great contrast to Tokyo. The Philosopher's path is probably the most useful ""hiking"" trail you'll find in the area, but it takes you to a few popular temples and it's very scenic."

That's a roughly 7500 USD (current exchange is better, but for simplicity $1 = ¥100)  If you can do that elsewhere, you should be ok... I'd maybe plan a spillover just in case...   Depending on hotels, restaurants, how far you travel. With a group I'd probably start doing some advanced planning. Check train prices you can do this with jurudan norikae english... I think Yahoo and Google also have pricing for local and shinkansen trains... Find your hotels and calculate those costs.   1 hotels 2 trains 3 food estimate per person per day times time 4 event cost - nothing in Japan is free.

There are so many sights and experiences to be had by just being there.   Food can be fairly cheap as well, as long as you stick to local cuisine.   Lastly, I failed to mention that my last trip was in 2012. The yen was killing the dollar at the time (something like 70 yen to the dollar). And I still made it on the amount I stated above."
JapanTravel,38ooxp,ukatama,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"For food I was actually thinking of buying from combini, heard it was cheap but plentiful. If local cuisine is affordable too, why not. Thanks for the advice!"
JapanTravel,38ooxp,laryrose,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"Conbini is definitely an option for some meals and snacks. But I wouldn't rely on it and it isn't always going to be the cheapest option.   Also factor in that while you can eat very well at a conbini, you might not be getting the best meals health-wise. Something I struggled with on earlier trips was not getting the correct nutrients and such that I needed to be energetic every day. Especially with an older couple, it might be a factor to think about.   That said, start researching local foods and restaurant types. There are plenty of places to get good ramen bowls and food sets for very cheap within Tokyo.   A lot of izakaya offer middle of the road pricing, but with good traditional atmosphere and such.  Anyway, obviously check out the budgets and food guides on japan guide. And if you have any other questions, ask away."

JapanTravel,38oprc,hjk110,3,Fri Jun 5 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm in Japan right now, leaving today! It was my first time here...it's amazing, you'll love it! Here's some random tips and things I wish I knew...  It will be HOT and humid when you are here! But Tokyo women are some of the most stylishly dressed I've ever seen, even in the heat. The guys look good too, but once you've seen 100 suits...  Most half decent hotels have all the bathroom stuff you need, soap, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush and tooth paste, hairbrush and night shirt.  I never wore my own pjs, or used my own toothbrush.   On the trains - Think about getting an IC card for the trains, it's easier to tap in and out, than trying to figure out how much to buy a ticket for for each trip you want to take. Hyperdia.com is a handy website for navigating the trains.   Check out the Robot Restaurant. It's like nothing else you've ever seen.   Find a store called Don Quiote, it's a chain store (lots around) with the most amazing assortment of stuff. Find the white curtain and check out what's behind it! Also, if you like clothes shopping. uniqco is a clothing store that is pretty cool. Kinda reminded me of H&M, but better quality.   Try an Onsen, a Japanese bath. Check out the procedure and etiquette before coming. If you have tattoos, bring surgical tape to cover them, bandaids might not stay on.   There are bathrooms everywhere and anywhere you need them. Odds are they will be the cleanest public bathrooms you've ever seen. Most have a bidet/spray wash function. It's the best and is one of the things I will miss about this amazing country.   Before you go, get a pocket wifi. You can order it to be dropped off at your hotel, or pick it up at the airport you land in. On the way out of the country you drop it in the mail in the prepaid envelope they give you. I used japanwireless.com. It came with a battery backup as well. Essential for navigating and learning what's around you!   The Ramen Museum is a trip!! Come hungry and order the small bowls so you can try a few different kinds.   K I think that's most things...have a blast!"

But, at the same time, if you're anything like me, you'll be disappointed if you try not to see/do everything you planned. Totally possible to do Nara/Osaka same day, although better if you start early. We were staying in Kyoto, took an early morning train to Nara. Spent a few hours there wandering around feeding deer, then went to Kobe for lunch, and spent the afternoon/evening in Osaka. It was a busy day, but it worked.   PS: There's a small temple near the back exit of the bamboo groves, Gio-ji, it was more or less empty and we really enjoyed visiting it. It's along the path, not really out of the way if you're already there."

Could be bad weather, a train accident (we saw a train delayed from an Antelope collision, although I think it was a bad translation, who knows). Other times you might be just too tired to go on.  Sometimes while wandering around, we were like it's still fairly early and this other thing is nearby"" and we ended up going to things we had planned other days.

You get your anime, manga, and tech stuff, the Namba area is right there if your parents aren't into all that.  Also, personally I think you're trying to pack too much into the second and third days in Kyoto for a ""relaxing phase"". When I went there a couple of years ago I think we ended up taking in only a couple of tourist spots a day."

JapanTravel,38odrj,Yung__Lean,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"In Tokyo, I recommend Ueno Park, Meiji Shrine, and Sensoji.  Also, the Tokyo Government building has two observation towers (North and South building) that are free to visitors.  Great view and gift shops.    I agree on splitting up Nara and Osaka.  My husband and I stayed four days in Kyoto, with two days dedicated to Kyoto and one each for day trips to Osaka and Nara.  In Osaka we went to the Osaka castle, the aquarium, and walked around Namba (big mall, but really neat building structure, lots of shops and restaurants).  We recently got two-week JR passes and went from Tokyo to Mt. Fuji, to Kyoto, Hiroshima/Miyajima and back.  You will have a blast."

Some asshat at our hostel told us to go there one night when we felt like going to some bars and didn't want to go from Asakusa to Shibuya since it's a 30 minute subway trip and the subway closes at 12.  The whole bar street was a red light district, Yakuza guys standing by their black cars asking if you want amphetamines or  female company, poor prostitutes in the corners asking you if you want to get your dick sucked.  It wasn't pretty, luckily we could walk back home from there."

It's 8,150 yen per night per person for a bungalow including a big traditional style dinner, breakfast, and access to a small hot spring bath. The food was really good, and the staff seemed nice enough, but they don't speak English, so you'll have to make the reservations in Japanese. This was 40 km of almost entirely up and down mountains so you will need to be in good shape, but we had a great time.  You might be able to find places to camp but then you'll probably want to bring your own food, because the smaller mountain towns don't have many shops and everything closes early. For example, Chikatsuyu where we stayed had a post office, two stores, maybe a cafe, and no restaurants or convenience stores. I think everything was closed by 7:30 or 8pm."

Nikko: mausoleums of two of the Tokugawa shogun, beautifully decorated. Also nice if you are into natural sceneries.  Kawagoe: Has preserved streets so it's known as the little Edo.  Matsumoto: Further out, beautiful black castle and also some wasabi farms I believe.  Hakone: though from what I read in this sub a week back Owakudani may be closed off due to volcanic activities? It's a nice area you can get around on a pass with various modes of transport, including a boat and a ropeway. On a clear day you may be able to see Mt Fuji if you are lucky.  Theme parks: Disneyland, Disneysea or Fuji Q depending on which is your cup of tea."

We also went to the Kirin Beer plant for a free tour and they're quite accommodating  to non-Japanese speaking people but the best part is the free beer at the end!

JapanTravel,38k9tf,MilkBone,3,Thu Jun 4 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Backpack with a packed duffel bag is the way I usually do it. Shorts and other light clothes are probably fine.  You'll be coming around typhoon season, so having a waterproof backpack or a rain cover for your bag might be a good idea. (Or if you're a cheapskate like me, just put all your belongings in plastic bags in your backpack.) Umbrellas and whatever else are easily purchased within Japan, though.  Most of all: pack light.

JapanTravel,38k9tf,Emnems,2,Fri Jun 5 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"It will still be in the upper 80's most likely, and humid as fuck. August is the worst month where I live (Or so I've been told. I came in September last year and it was pretty hot)  Shorts are fine but Japan is very conservative when it comes to necklines. The general rule of thumb is nothing below your armpit. Also, in many restaurants and various places you will need to take your shoes off. Being barefoot is frowned upon, even if you wear the slippers they provide. Either wear socks or bring some in your bag.   Almost everything is easily bought here. You can pick up an umbrella at any dollar stores or convenience store.   Bring whatever meds you may need. Feminine hygiene isn't difficult to find but I've had a difficult time finding one that I really like, so I would suggest bringing some if you will need it."
JapanTravel,38k9tf,saroka,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:44:08 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience I didn't experience the neckline thing at all.

But I've never ever seen a low neckline in the 9 months I've lived here and I've only seen someone barefoot twice, one was wearing flip-flops and the other one was an elementary school student and was scolded by the teacher.   Of course you can get away with almost anything if you are a foreigner. No one is going to walk up to you on a train and tell you to show less boob... OK an old lady actually might lol. But that doesn't mean it's accepted or approved of by Japanese culture."

I live in a city and even my daily shoes for the city still were tough to survive in through the day.)  1 cardigan I carried in my backpack for if a place was air conditioned  It's quite a bit but maybe that'll give you an idea of what to pack for yourself. I packed everything into a carry on suitcase and a backpack for my laptop and DS."

JapanTravel,38kzj1,choboy456,3,Thu Jun 4 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"Summer is a peak travel time so I don't know how much fluctuation you will see. I am in a similar boat though...  When I recently traveled to Japan, I had a layover through Pudong International Airport from KIX, and it did require going through customs. I don't know if Hong Kong has a transit option, but basically I ended up waiting in line for three hours after arriving had to pass through immigration, and then had to reenter the gate. I only had a carry-on so I didn't have to worry about luggage at that time.   I think you have to pass through arrivals and customs before you can go to a domestic terminal."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tkshy,2,Thu Jun 4 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it looks most airports have some sort of accelerated transfer for international flights, with the exception of US and China airports for some reason"
JapanTravel,38kzj1,jamar030303,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:58:10 2015 UTC,China is weird. Int'l->Int'l transfers without going through immigration only apply to certain airlines and certain flights (off the top of my head I can think of American connecting to Cathay Pacific to continue to Hong Kong and some airline connecting to Lufthansa?).
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tkshy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"From my understanding US and Chinese passport holders have more strict visa requirements for one another. China has a temporary option but you have to have an address of somewhere you'll be staying. It just takes a bit longer and at immigration they are going to ask where you're staying and you'll have to show your connecting flight ticket. When I transferred through Shanghai, there were four large international flights arriving at once, so it took a really long time to get through the line, but reentering the gate took maybe 20 minutes, but again, nearly three hours to pass through immigration."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tariqabjotu,3,Fri Jun 5 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Do you think prices will drop right before the time to fill all open seats?   Don't count on that. Look up the cost of flights for next week, or two weeks. You'll probably see that they're more expensive. If they're not, it's only because some airlines don't see the first half of June as peak summer season yet.   If I have a 2 or 3 hour layover in Hong Kong or Taipai do I have to go through customs there and then again in Japan or just once I get to Japan?   You don't have to go through customs when transferring at Hong Kong or Taipei. You must go through security. In general, going through customs for international transit is exceedingly rare, with the U.S. basically the only country that does it. Security for international transit is standard around the world, and a serious risk if it's not done.  Hong Kong has the nicer airport, by the way.   Along these lines, if I land first in Narita then take a connecting flight to Osaka do I go through customs in Narita or Osaka?   You go through immigration and customs at Narita."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,laryrose,2,Fri Jun 5 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"Hm, for my connecting flight from SFO --> Heathrow --> Milan, I had to go through customs and security."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tariqabjotu,2,Fri Jun 5 03:55:21 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Were your bags not checked all the way through or something? Or they refused to give you your boarding pass for the second leg of your journey at SFO? That really shouldn't happen.
JapanTravel,38kzj1,laryrose,2,Fri Jun 5 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"What? I started in SFO and had to go through customs at Heathrow. My bags continued on. I made the plane; that's not the point. The point is that I had to go through customs for a connecting flight at Heathrow. Everyone who had a connecting flight had to go through customs before going through security again (this was all closed off in a secure part of the airport, where all arrivals with connecting flights had to go through customs and security in order to get to their next gate)."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tariqabjotu,5,Fri Jun 5 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my answer is based on the fact that you generally don't need to go through customs when doing an international transit through Heathrow. You even confirm that your checked bags continued on. So what were they doing customs for? Your hand luggage that they're going to proceed to screen anyway, that's not even going to enter the UK? Seems odd. I really think you're mistaken, but that's beside the point."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,Toiretachi,2,Fri Jun 5 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, did you travel around the time of any terrorist threats/activity? Just wondering if it might have been more of a situational thing than standard practice."
JapanTravel,38kzj1,tkshy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! Looks like a transfer might be better than going to Narita then, they have much more time between connections and I'd hate to get held up in customs."

JapanTravel,38izlu,lindajing,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"I just recently returned from Japan and here are some notes based on your itinerary   Day 3 Why not do the Skytree instead of Tokyo Tower? The Skytree is close to Asakusa. Shopping IMO is better in Shinjuku vs. Shibuya. Ginza is the highend area but I still found Shinjuku to be the best place to shop. Day 5, it won't take long to explore all you've listed. You might be able to add something that day. Day 6, depending what time you arrive you might be able to go see something else. I arrived in Kyoto and immediately went to Golden Pavilion and then to the bamboo forest. The full day Arashiyama didn't appeal to me, well at least not everything. Kyoto - I found the Eastern Kyoto Full day trip to take A LOT longer than what's listed. I rented a bike (which might have added to the time) and was able to see just Ginkakuji, Philosopher's Path, Chion-in and Kiyomizudera. Chion-in wasn't on the itinerary but after doing research this was a must for me."
JapanTravel,38izlu,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I've found that Kyoto usually takes a few days to see a lot of things, with the alternative being to see less and spend more time at several destinations. It takes a considerable amount of time moving around to each temple, and everything seemed to close pretty early..."
JapanTravel,38izlu,tkshy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yes when I looked at Google, it appeared that it was only a one hour walk from Ginkakuji to Kiyomizudera. Seems reasonable since you'll be stopping at other sites, but after actually going there it was way further.  Basically I found that with Kyoto I had time to do about 3-4 sites a day plus travel. So first day I did Golden pavilion, Nijo Castle, and bamboo forest, I used public transportation to get to each site. I could have done more, but it's easy to overestimate how much energy you'll have. I ended up getting tired quickly."
JapanTravel,38jgzw,1834419,3,Thu Jun 4 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"Why would you make a reservation on the other side of the country the day after you fly into Tokyo? Your best bet will be to jump straight onto the Shinkansen on the 10th when you get into Tokyo. You said ""afternoon"" so you should be able to make at least the last Shinkansen. If you're using JR Pass, you have to transfer at Shin-Osaka. Otherwise you can pay for the Nozomi Shinkansen, takes about 5 hours to get to Hakata, the main station in Fukuoka.  Then take the bus the next day to Kurokawa.  You can also wait to take the Shinkansen early on the 11th. If you take a Nozomi Shinkansen that departs before 7 am you should be able to make it to Hakata Station in time to catch your bus to Kurokawa. Note that that's Nozomi, so JR Pass won't cover it. You'd probably be cutting it a bit close. You also might not be able to make seat reservations, so cross your fingers you can find a seat on the open seating car.  Honestly, you should look into flying. Peach Aviation has some cheap (under 100USD) flights to Fukuoka from Narita. What airport are you flying into? Also, what ryokan will you be at in Kurokawa? I'm going to Kyushu in October and am considering a night in Kurokawa as well. Have a blast! Good luck with the transfer to Kurokawa!"

We will look into flying there."
JapanTravel,38jgzw,reol7x,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"I went to Kurokawa onsen last October, I think you're going to have a difficult time. It really probably would be best to fly from Tokyo.  We took the Shinkansen from to Kumamoto, and caught the bus at the JR Kumamoto station. The bus left @ 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. to Kurokawa from there.  When we went TO Kurokawa, we left from Kyoto, so the Shinkansen was shorter. When we left Kurokawa, we went to Tokyo, between the bus and Shinkansen, we spent almost 12 hours travelling."

JapanTravel,38j57k,utterbutterfly,7,Thu Jun 4 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"I've heard lots of stories (some on this subreddit) about how this can be problematic, and that I may be challenged at immigration over re-entering so long after staying 3 months.   Yes. You aren't currently on a 'visa', you are on a visa waiver which is available for relatively short term trips to Japan, and isn't meant to be used in a serial fashion to stay in Japan long term. You will very likely get a stern talking-to from immigration at Narita if you come back a week later and say you are staying for another several months. They are mainly concerned that you are working illegally in Japan. It happened to me, even though I was paying my own way (and ended up getting a job and a work visa while on my second 90 day visa waiver).  Your options are a) lie to immigration, which I wouldn't recommend b) come back and be ready to not only explain to them why you are spending so much time in Japan, but also have bank statements and other documents proving that you can afford to pay your way in Japan for another 3 months without working there, or c) not return to Japan immediately and wait a bit before coming back to do your job search."
JapanTravel,38j57k,geekpondering,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:59:26 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, getting a second 90 days isn't usually a problem, but whatever you do, don't tell immigration that you are looking for work.

Golden Gai, Memory Lane, and the Tokyo Government Building are all in the Shinjuku area. Also lots of shopping down there. Also akihabara is interesting even if you're not all that into manga/anime. Check out the shrine next to Harajuku while you're there and go shopping in Ometesando Hills (really nice shopping area). I would recommend Asakusa while you're in Tokyo as well, Sensoji Temple and the crazy packed shops out front are a lot of fun and filled with some great snacks.  While you're in Osaka you should check out Dotonbouri. Also, unless you're really into observation decks I don't really think both Umeda and Abeno Haruka are necessary. I would pick just one (Abeno is closer to a shopping area with lots of department stores, Umeda has some cool restaurants in the basement) If you're going to go to Hiroshima then I think you'd be better off with a JR pass, still you should calculate it with Hyperdia to be sure. If it's close then just get the pass, it makes it much easier to get around. Hiroshima and especially Miyajima are worth a trip if you have the time. So far I've been to way more temples than that and I wouldn't say I'm ""templed out"". That being said, I spaced out my temple days and sandwiched them between trips to more urban areas to keep things interesting. See a sumo tournament if you can!"

JapanTravel,38hf22,kyouteki,2,Thu Jun 4 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"I've stayed at Juyoh 4 times, and I like it, but I think my base of operations for any further trips to Tokyo will be the similarly-located and I think sister property Hotel Meigetsu. The walk to Meigetsu from Minami-Senju is a bit more pleasant, and it is also just about as far from Senju-Ohashi station on the Keisei Main Line. My favorite thing about it, though, is that it quite a bit quieter at night, so leaving windows open at night without having to wear earplugs is a much better option."
JapanTravel,38hf22,pickledpeachcake,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:08:01 2015 UTC,A few people have said it but I agree- airbnb. I stayed in a few airbnb places in Japan including Tokyo. There were lots of good budget options all over tokyo for all different group sizes.

JapanTravel,38hf22,DJSBX,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:39:56 2015 UTC,"The first time I went to Tokyo, me and some friends stayed at Sakura Hostel in Asakusa. Pretty affordable and really nice. The only downside is that if you want a JR train you'd need to train to Akihabara or some other surrounding place as there are no JR trains attached to Asakusa directly (assuming I remember properly). As others have mentioned AirBnB is also a really good option. I stayed at one in Higashi-Nihombashi just a month ago and it was great."
JapanTravel,38hf22,tkshy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"I stayed here at the recommendation of a friend. It's a design-y hostel in Asakusa near Asakusa. I booked about a month out and the cost per night was 3600￥. The rooms look like concrete bunkers, but I kind of like that so I wasn't bothered by it.  It's in the middle of a residential neighborhood, next to a main road, and is about 10 minutes from the train station. I had meetings elsewhere in Tokyo while I stayed here, and ended up returning around 11pm each day at which point it was pretty quiet in the neighborhoods.  Overall not bad for staying in Tokyo for cheap though I might add it is very far from the center of the city.  Oh, and business hotels are also an option. Some have discounts for booking 45 days in advance, and have student rates for some reason if you have a valid ID. Nightly charge is closer to 6500¥/night or higher (which is nearly 50USD considering the exchange rate these days.)"
JapanTravel,38hf22,kaseijin64,0,Thu Jun 4 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"Find a business hotel in Kawasaki. You aren't going to find anything that meets your budget in Tokyo proper.   Kawasaki offers the benefits of being conveniently located between Tokyo and Yokohama, it's not super close to either but you are about a 20 minute train ride from central Tokyo.   The Kawasaki station area offers a lot in the way of stores, restaurants etc.   Other good options are in West Tokyo, I liked Machida a lot but the train into Tokyo is extremely crowded. Hachioji is probably the cheapest place to stay but it's a good 40 minutes from Shinjuku by train.   Overall I recommend Kawasaki as the best convenience to cost ratio."
JapanTravel,38hf22,laryrose,3,Thu Jun 4 06:18:01 2015 UTC,There are loads of hostels in Tokyo proper for under $50USD a night.

JapanTravel,38f2g1,banankontakt,6,Wed Jun 3 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"You'll probably want to come up with a list of stuff you want to see that's somewhat prioritized, and sorted by area of town. ""Kyoto"" is a pretty huge area, and it can take over an hour to get from one side of town to the other on the bus, so you might end up wasting a ton of time by 'winging it'."

JapanTravel,38f2g1,xinganbaobei,6,Thu Jun 4 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think most people have very detailed itineraries because they are dropping several thousand dollars on a trip they may not ever get to repeat again. So it really it depends on what you consider valuable and if you plan on visiting again. If you find your time most valuable, planning as much as you can ahead of time is your best option. I felt my first trip to Tokyo was a waste of a lot of time and money because we did very little planning. It was also pre-iphone era so we spent the majority of it just lost. I think nowadays it is easier to wing it with smartphones. Yelp and TripAdvisor come in very handy when you have an afternoon free and nothing planned.  Even with detailed planning you end up spending a lot of time commuting and finding your way around, so it's a good idea to have a rough plan at the very least.   If you plan on eating at high-end restaurants or visiting a lot of tourist attractions/museums or other special attractions you'll need to do a lot more planning, researching open hours and commute times, and possibly make reservations."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,charade_scandal,2,Wed Jun 3 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's so crazy to think about my first two trips there without wifi. So so so much time lost.   Frankly even with wifi it's still easy to get spun around.  But yeah, so much wasted time."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,tenkadaiichi,10,Thu Jun 4 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"That is how I traveled in Japan, for the most part. In fact, I was even one step behind you -- I had an idea of where I wanted to go, and would book a room when that was my next stop. ie, I am in Tokyo, and plan to go to Kyoto. It is now time to book my Kyoto room. Once I am in Kyoto, it is time to book my room in Hiroshima.  That has worked out just fine for me, however I have not traveled during peak travel times (like Golden Week).  Regarding day trips with your JR pass -- do it. You'll never be refused a spot on the train. It may be standing room only on the unreserved cars, but you will be able to get on and go wherever you want.  Heck, I was in Osaka and took a day trip to Tokyo just because it was the weekend and I wanted to see the Harajuku silliness."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,charade_scandal,6,Wed Jun 3 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"Brave! It's funny, it's probably been a fairly trouble free way to travel but I myself could not imagine doing it that way! Just a bit too nervous.  I'll plot out and book the cities in advance and then in a Word doc list possible things to do each day. I rarely do them all but if I can cross off a couple I feel like it was a productive day. The only thing I leave loose if my departure times from the various cities unless I have to be elsewhere for a particular thing.  Since I'm vegetarian, planning meals has to be a bit more rigid but at the same time I'm happy to grab something at a Subway etc if I have too."

Reading Lonely Planet the night before is my usual modus operandi. :)  When I was in Kyoto I got food poisoning (I suspect it was actually a lactose intolerance reaction, but the effect was the same) and it knocked me out for two days. I couldn't extend my stay in Kyoto as I was crashing at a friend's near Osaka, but my schedule was flexible enough that I just went back to Kyoto for a few day trips to catch what I had missed."

Obviously i like to make sure what i want to do on that particular day but other than that i'm not much of a planner and it's good that it apparently works quite well too :)  When i'm in Tokyo i'll most likely say within that area at least because there's so much to see but later on i will go to Osaka and from there i plan to do day trips to other cities as well.
JapanTravel,38f2g1,ThisIsSoWrong,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah Osaka is a good base for day trips. Kyoto is nearby. Nara is nearby. Nagoya is pretty close. Kobe and Hiroshima (as well as Miyajima, though they seem to use a different name nowadays) are close as well. Others that I am forgetting as well, I'm sure.  See if you get make it to Nikko as a day-trip from Tokyo."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,ThisIsSoWrong,4,Thu Jun 4 04:57:14 2015 UTC,"You mention the JR pass, that's something you can only plan in advance.  Reservations for popular things (restaurants, shows) might need to be done in advance.  Timed events (again shows, seasonal events, local festivals) are a third thing that are also most likely unavailable if you don't plan for them. A weaker example are venues with limited opening hours (e.g. many museums are closed one day in the week).  Lastly, there is research - finding out what's on offer and what you would like to see/do. There are a LOT of options, especially in a place like Tokyo, and you could spend a non-trivial amount of time to settle on what you would like to do.  Those are the things I can come up with where planning is crucial. For the rest, I think you'll be able to wing it. Traveling is quite easy, accomodation depends on the season and your budget.  One thing that a tight planning may help with is time management. Many travelers may only have a week or two at most, and really want to make the most their stay. Are you intending a longer stay? That might be one reason why you feel less compelled to make a detailed planning.  Making a planning is also just a lot of work. Some people enjoy it because they get excited about what's in store, some don't - I am in the latter category myself. If you feel the same way as me, I would still recommend that you do some planning, especially for the 'research' category. I have spent mornings in Japan just reading japan-guide.com, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. Planning in advance could have helped me a lot with that."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,charade_scandal,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:46:29 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Are you sure the JR pass need to be planned in advance? From what i have understood it you can either reserve seats later the same day or get unreserved or standing seats at at train whenever.
JapanTravel,38f2g1,Gurtang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:16:29 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  Ah, you're right - reserving seats and the like is usually fine without planning. I think there are a few lines without unreserved seats, so those might be full during high season/peak hours.   What I meant was that you have to order the JR pass itself in advance; that's not something you can postpone until the moment you want to use it. That's all."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,FermiAnyon,3,Thu Jun 4 13:43:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno man. I'm somewhere in the middle. I think a day should have a couple options at least. I usually have about three and end up doing one or two.  Like you could just go to Nara but if you don't do research you could end up missing a big temple and afterwards kick yourself. Without some planning you may find yourself underwhelmed by certain cities but it would probably be due to stuff you missed (and did not know about it).   But in terms of a more broad 'I'm just not sure where exactly I'll go on a given day' I guess you could do that and just use your SIM card to Google stuff on the train or the night before.  But I mean, an hour online here or there before you leave won't kill ya!"
JapanTravel,38f2g1,TipToeingWorld,3,Wed Jun 3 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"The importance of planning ahead depends on many factors, including your budget, the comfort you seek, the time of your travel and the things you want to see. 4 years ago I traveled across Japan on a 3-week JR pass, from Sendai to Yakushima, making every booking the night before, with only a lonely planet and no internet, at a relatively busy period (autumn, red leaves). And it wasn't THAT expensive.  However I wouldn't do it again. Tansportation, hotel bookings and overall everything service-related are extremely reliable in Japan, and online information is abundant, so it is a nice country to book ahead in. :)  But as I said you can also wing it : If you're not on a tight budget and are not travelling at a crowded time, there are hotels etc everywhere. Just be aware that some things have closing days/times that can be unexpected for foreigners (like many temples close at 5PM, and closing days can be things like ""every third tuesday in a month"", which can be a pain to calculate...), and that some places you'd expect to be able to see without problem require reservation, sometimes months in advance (imperial palace and villas, Ghibli museum...)  Oh, and one last thing : don't underestimate the ""unless crowded period"" advice. The Japanese don't have many holidays. When they do, they ALL travel at the same time. And this country has the highest population density in the word (when excluding micro-countries). In festival times and holiday times, there can be litterally 0 seats and 0 rooms left in some trains and towns, with millions of people piling up in the same places."
JapanTravel,38f2g1,nibill,2,Thu Jun 4 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"I went with my sister and brother-in-law a few years ago and we spent a week in Kyoto and a week in Tokyo and had a list of things we wanted to do in the vicinity of each city.  We had our rail passes to cover us and no hard and fast plans... just ""What do you feel like today?  It feels like a beach day to me.  Kamakura.  Done!"" kind of stuff.  It was the best vacation ever!  Did we do everything on the list?  No.  But Japan's not going anywhere and we'll get to that stuff later.  If you overplan, then it's just going to be a bunch of appointments and you're going to forget to chill the fuck out and have a good time.  So do your research.  Know where things are, how much they cost, how long it takes to get there, etc.  And then when you're on the ground over there, just chill and do what you're in the mood to do.  Don't force it, you're on vacation!"
JapanTravel,38f2g1,karllucas,2,Thu Jun 4 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'm very strict when it comes to plan my travel. I always have detailed itinerary in hand, how to get to place and how much I should spend for a day. I find it the easiest way to safe time and money. But I never limit myself from exploring off the beaten path or finding unknown places or cafes. For this I always allocate one day free from any things to do in my itinerary and wandering around the city like a lost traveler."

I've spent three months in total in Japan so far and except for the ho(s)tels nothing was planned.  I'll be back this summer for a month in Osaka and haven't planned or booked anything except the hostel. It's a cheap one, so if I stay somewhere else, not much money wil have been wasted.

Best because it's right in front of Fujisan, across the lake, without any other buildings. You can really just soak in the water with just the mountain and the lake in sight. It's the only one with such a good situation (other hotels have a view of the lake and fuji, but not as well, and I haven't heard of a better onsen.)  But it's not a traditional ryokan, and I'd say Fujisan is less awesome in august when he's not covered in snow anymore.  You could also try Hakone instead of the Fujigoko area. I'd say it has more to offer, even if the weather is not good enough to see the mountain."

So yeah, don't give up and try the lost and found. Once again, Hurray for Japanese train workers!"

JapanTravel,389ywl,adam_364,4,Tue Jun 2 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"Ishigaki Island has been my favorite place in Japan so far. Beautiful lonely beaches, with crystal clear water and white sand, perfect for swimming, snorkeling and just lazing around under the sun. There's also a tropical forest spread throughout the whole island, with great hikes and unique flora and fauna. The typical Okinawa cuisine was also great, very down to earth but very yummy with stuff like Asa Tempura (deep fried seaweed), Onigiri with eggs and Spam and delicious beef. The people were so nice there, inviting me for food, drinks and just generally friendly. It also serves as a hub to visit some of the surrounding islands like Kuroshima, Iriomote or Taketomi island.  Flights there were pretty cheap (Peach flies there from Osaka) and hostels can be found from 10-15$/day. Going back there myself this year. Would definitely recommend!"
JapanTravel,389ywl,adam_364,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:42:36 2015 UTC,Hmm $300 round trip flight sounds pretty good. Now you're making me think of doing an Okinawan island hopping trip.  How much was it to travel by boat between islands?
JapanTravel,389ywl,adam_364,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"300$ actually seems like quite a lot to me..I guess it depends on the season though. For my flight this year, I payed 50$ there (although flying in from Naha) and around 85$ back to Tokyo (both by ANA).   To iriomote, it's around 4000 Yen for a round trip, although there's also a slower car ferry I heard, that's around half as much, but it only operates on certain days of the week.   Taketomi and Kuroshima are closer and I think a round trip for both should be around the 1500 Yen range.   I believe until last year, peach covered the route Naha-Ishigaki with flights for as little as 10$, but it seems they stopped now :("
JapanTravel,389ywl,cuauhtlatoatzin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:55:28 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, I was looking at direct flights from Osaka. It makes more sense to do Naha first though because they'll probably have more flights going there.  $10?! What a steal. Though $50~$90 for round trip flights is still pretty cheap."

JapanTravel,389ywl,ProverbialFunk,3,Thu Jun 4 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"I'm taking a few weeks to travel in Japan in October. I'm interested in visiting picturesque, medium sized cities, preferably with more green or nature-y spaces.  Places I'm interested in:  Kagoshima  While the city itself doesn't seem particularly different than other urban Japanese areas, the location of the city on the bay with the views of looming Sakurajima just make Kagoshima seem so attractive and gorgeous to me. Add in gorgeous places like Senganen, Shiroyama Park, and access to other great places like Ibusuki and Cape Nagasakibana, makes Kagoshima my #1 destination for my upcoming trip!  Sendai  While larger than Kagoshima (about twice the size), Sendai has always been on my list of cities I'd love to visit. I've never been to Tohoku and would love to take a few days from Tokyo to spend in Sendai. Despite it's size of about a million, Sendai just seems like it has that small town vibe, and it seems uncharacteristically green for a Japanese city. Aoba-dori just looks so gorgeous, I can't wait to walk up and down, checking out the restaurants and shops. The campuses of Tohokudai, walking through the parks, views from the bridges over Hirosegawa. Plus, Matsushima is accessible as a day trip from Sendai. Sendai just seems magical to me!   Onomichi  The most gorgeous view I've ever been fortunate enough to see was off the countless islands dotting the Seto-naikai while I stayed on a small island near Kasaoka, Okayama. Onomichi looks amazing, with it's hilly, more traditional streets along the mountains, and then the sea-side streets along the sea, which at that point is no wider than a big river. All the islands along the Shimanami Kaido just seem so picturesque and lovely.   Now, can anyone recommend any other cities with similar vibes? I'm considering doing an itinerary that's basically Kagoshima -> Matsuyama -> Shimanami Kaido, then back to Tokyo. And then doing Sendai as a 2 day trip from there. Matsuyama seems like a good choice, but it's hard to get a feel for the city from my research. I'm familiar with some of the attractions, but it doesn't seem to have that ""green"" feel that a city like Sendai, for example, has."
JapanTravel,389ywl,perfectmachine,3,Wed Jun 3 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, Cape Nagasakibana was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. It has a pretty spectacular view and it was a lot of fun to jump around on the sea etched lava flows. If you look into the tide pools, they're teeming with life. Lots of little fish and crustaceans.  Have you selected your accommodations in Ibusuki? I recommend Ryokan Kawakyu. The guy who runs it is extremely friendly and is pretty fluent in English (kind of a godsend when you're out that far in the boonies). I was travelling alone and knowing there aren't many restaurants in the city, he invited me to join him for Yakuniku with his family at the ryokan. Damn that was fun and super delicious."
JapanTravel,389ywl,ProverbialFunk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"Now I'm even more excited for Nagasakibana n_n I'll make sure to check out the tide pools while I'm exploring.  I'm actually not going to overnight in Ibusuki. I'm going to be based in Kagoshima and plan to do a day trip or two from there. So I'm just going to head to Ibusuki early, explore Nagasakibana, then head back for a sand bath and a dip in the rotemburo at Healthy Land before taking the train back to Kagoshima and getting drunk at Tenmonkan n___n"
JapanTravel,389ywl,perfectmachine,3,Thu Jun 4 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"Went last year ( on the cheap ) and LOVED it.  Hit up a few different cities, and my 'mistake' was spreading ourselves too thin, but I don't regret it because each locale was unique.    My favorites in no particular order:    Kyoto   Arishiyama Monkey Park and biking through the Bamboo Groves & Visiting Temples in the area  (Maybe my favorite part of our trip)  Fushimi Inari Shrine - Absolutely incredible, nothing like this exists elsewhere. Found a Sweet Flea Market with old Japanese stuff, but it was kinda pricey.   Nara   The Largest Buddhist Temple / wooden structure in the world!  Feeding Deer apples/crackers out of your hand!  The weird feeling of being in a town that feels like it was constructed for tourism and old temples   Osaka   The Food and Shopping are much cheaper The SUPER Long Over, AND UNDERGround Mall, that spans multiple blocks in the heart of the city The Aquarium was worth it.  Some of the subway stops play a '1-up' type sound when the doors open, Loved that.  Osaka Castle (Not inside) area was Incredible. The COOLEST Park I've ever been in... Since it was Cherry Blossom Season there were THOUSANDS of people chilling on blankets, drinking and having a nice chill time.  Everything is made to look beautiful in all Japan's parks.   Hakone   IMO the most overlooked part of Japan that everyone should do. Hot Springs - The Onsen Experience in Japan is unique, and being naked in a natural spring with strangers is more liberating and less weird than you'd think. Very cool experience.  The Five Types of Transportation Tour was well worth it too, easy to get to Haknoe from Tokyo via JR. (pass)   Tokyo    Metropolitan Gov Building for Free view Various Temples scattered throughout the busy city Ninja Akasaka for a 'touristy' but really good gourmet'ish restaurant Harijuku and Shibuya and Akasaka and the Fish Market and...everywhere.  Hanami (Sakura Viewing) - ALL the Places that can possibly be landscaped, are made incredible during the Spring. Finding / Getting a Tattoo in Tokyo with my wife    Man I miss Japan already."
JapanTravel,389ywl,ProverbialFunk,3,Wed Jun 3 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Damn, that sounds like an awesome itinerary. I did twice as many cities, but didn't get nearly enough time to explore a lot of what you did. Definitely going to save this for my next Kanto/Kansai trip."

Then i noticed a Japanese guy in the same pool with a sweet Koi on his arm... that no one seemed to care about.  I feel like the 'regular Japanese folk' dont care about them to be honest...especially not if they're on 'Gaijan'.  The staff has to ask you to cover them up, in order to placate the perceived fears of their customers."

JapanTravel,389ywl,tkshy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:17:07 2015 UTC,My honest advice would be to just go(onsen) and wait/hope they don't kick you out...they don't really like confrontation and there are not like any cops or authority figures in the actual OnSen usually. It's a risk but the alternative is covering all that up.
JapanTravel,389ywl,Yung__Lean,4,Tue Jun 9 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"Rabbit island, Okunoshima  For the scenery, history, obscene amount of fluffy rabbits, cycling and hikes. It was a good day trip to wind down away from the big cities."
JapanTravel,389ywl,Gurtang,2,Wed Jun 3 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to, well, most of Japan (yet) and I'm working on visiting Kyushu myself this year. Like everyone else, I can recommend places within the three main cities.  Tokyo   Takeshita Dori. Even if you don't actually care too much for teenage fashion, the street itself is neat, there's always some food and snacks, and it;s close to another favourite spot of mine... Meiji Shrine. Yup. You're not far from the roads, the train tracks, and the busy city the whole time, but you feel it like you are. A great little spot of comfy silence in the city. And while you're in the neigborhood... Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. Go to the top floor near sunset, and get some great photos of the sprawl of Tokyo, along with some perspective on how big the city really is. And if you're lucky, you'll spot (and snap) Fuji-san off in the distance. A night time walk around Shinjuku (and even the station itself) is also a neat look inside Tokyo's office culture. Kabuki-cho is also nearby if you want to grab a drink or a snack at izakaya. I can't forget about Shibuya for people watching, neat little shops, and Tokyu Hands! I love the TH in Shibuya the best. Say Hi to Hachiko while you're there! Ueno Park. The Zoo and the Museum are a great way to kill a warm (or hot!) day, the park itself has its own shrines and lovely walks amongst trees and gardens. Peaceful and calming, for the the antithesis of a park in the middle of Tokyo. The neighborhood of Ueno is also full of little shops and restaurants, including one place that imports goods from Okinawa. They carry sugar cane ice cream, one of my literal favorite things about Japan. Really.  Akihabara! Geek culture, geek toys, geek girls and geek boys. I feel at home in this part of the city ALMOST more than I do in Shibuya. So much so that when I AM in Tokyo, I visit Akiba at least once a day. It feels weird if I don't.   Oh, and a great daytrip out of the city (and fast becoming my dream town to lie in) is Kamakura. Even if you're not one for the Daibutsu, the seaside town is charming, and so is Hachimangu Shrine. The street you walk on the way there is SO cute, and the locals are polite and smiley. :3  Kyoto So much that I love, just trust that these are the top of the must see places in this city. You can (IMHO) skip everything else so long as you see:   Kiyomizu-dera Fushimi-Inari Nijo Castle (Home of the ""No, it's okay, just hire extra guards and get me back to a quieter castle!"" nightingale floors ;D) Koto-in at Daitoku-ji Ryoan-ji Gion/Pontocho   Really.  Osaka A workers and working city. Stay near Osaka Station, it's the best hub for trains around and out of the city. Fukushima area is my favourite personally. :3   Osaka Castle (they have GREAT soft serve ice cream. Eat ALL the ice cream in Japan!) Dotobori (especially at night) Osaka City Station and surrounding area (excellent shopping) Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan. (You descend around a giant tank that holds an array of ocean life, and the outer tanks show you the animals you'd encounter if it were the ocean, layer by layer. Supercool!   FYI - Osaka is for shopping. Tokyo is great, but expensive and it really caters to the better off and supremely fashionable 20-28 years of age group. Osaka is a bit more balanced, unless you need to have the newest and best in your clothing. :3"
JapanTravel,389ywl,Gurtang,2,Wed Jun 3 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"Tokyo has every kind of shopping you can possibly imagine. It is true that certain areas that tourists frequent cater to that group, however"
JapanTravel,389ywl,Gurtang,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:13:32 2015 UTC,"Even the hip areas near Shibuya and Shinjuku where no gaijins are visiting are kind of expensive when it comes to shopping. Even second hand is really expensive.  Probably depends on what you're comparing it with, I'm Swedish and our clothes are pretty expensive, the ones I visited in Tokyo was a few dollars cheaper tops and if you got stuff from Japanese brands they were even more expensive."
JapanTravel,389ywl,nikorasu_the_great,2,Fri Jun 5 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"I too have some Osaka related recommendations, spent a lot of time hanging out there.   Umeda–Shopping and food, several bars and clubs if you go a bit east to Higashi-umeda. Recommend staying near the station, but walking along Midosuji is pretty nice because you pass some of the government buildings, you will hit Shinsaibashi after about 30 minutes of walking. Recommend the Umeda Sky building too.  Utsubokoen–Nice place to walk, nice bars in the summer around that area, as well. Kitashinchi–Nightlife, izakaya, bars also along Midosuji street. Tenjinbashi area–Super long shoutengai and over the summer Tenjin Matsuri. Tenma has a lot of bars.  Shinsaibashi, Dotonbori–""Iconic"" Osaka views, with the Glico man billboard, lots of shopping, and food. Kind of boring after a few visits though. I like some of the kissaten style coffee shops that are around that area. There's also a few night clubs that are pretty fun there too.   Places that native Osakan's claim is ""deep Osaka"" that are worth visiting:   Shinsekai: Probably one of my favorite places, because of its weird history. It's right next to Tennouji, and the new Abeno Harukas building. Also considered one of Osaka and Japan's most dangerous streets. The Tsuutenkaku is pretty fascinating, too. Recommend getting kushikatsu here.  Tsuruhashi–large Zainichi Korean population here, and really good/cheap yakiniku/Korean barbecue. You basically can smell the yakiniku getting off the train stop here. Also, in the summer get the reimen (naengmyun). Sumiyoshi Taisha–large and nice temple complex."

JapanTravel,389ywl,nikorasu_the_great,2,Fri Jun 5 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"I hugely prefer nature over city activities, otaku culture, clubbing, etc, so I can't talk about that. For the rest, I can't just rank my top 3. But I made categories.   I also linked to posts on my blog, don't know if there are rules against that... (and it's all in French, but there are pictures too ! sorry :p)  Most beautiful scenery  Honorable mention : anywhere with cherry trees at the right time... especially Mount Fuji from Kawaguchiko lake or Chureito Pagoda. Haven't made a blog post about that one in spring, but it's already awesome in winter :)  Two of the ""3 views of Japan"" are cool too, if the weather is good : Amanohashidate, and Matsushima bay.  Number one : The third view, Miyajima in the fall. I could go back there every year and keep photographing the maple leaves and the Torii at sunset and at night.  Best onsen + ryokan  Honorable mention : many places in Hakone and Izu (haven't been to one overlooking the sea, but soon !)  Number one : Takaragawa Onsen Osenkaku. 4 huge mixed-gender natural-looking black rock outdoor baths, along a river, in the forest. Especially in the snow. And it's relatively cheap, with great food.  Best zen/temples experience :  Honorable mention : Kyoto is awesome. The Kinkakuji is really beautiful when it's sunny or snowy (pretty rare I think). Kiyomizu-dera is very impressive. Kyoto can be very enjoyable even outside of peak autumn leaves or sakura seasons, but they sure add something.  Number one : Koyasan, with a night in a temple (shukubo), with snow and sun, and maybe 15 other visitors in the entire town. I stayed at Fukuchiin, it was awesome.  Food :  Honorable mention : Kaiseki food of course, but it really depends on your budget (and your interest for food). I don't think it's worth it if you're a little tight : save to taste everything else ! Because there's a lot of good stuff. Kaitensushi, cheap and fun. Sukiyaki, teppanyaki, shabu shabu, all great. The list goes on...  Number one : really funny, user-friendly, a great experience, especially if you're travelling with friends : Okonomiyaki !  Bonus, one city spot :  Not very ""authentic"", but a discovery I made recently (and keep telling people about on this sub :p) : ""The Peak Bar/Lounge"" in the Park Hyatt hotel, Tokyo, Shinjuku. A really amazing place to have a drink overlooking Tokyo. It's not just the view, it has an amazing atmosphere with lanterns and plants, doesn't feel uptight at all unlike many other high-end hotel bars. And the prices are reasonable compared to the competition (of course it's still expensive, but at least there is no cover charge for just coming in). I didn't expect to have such a good time in a high-end hotel bar. Really an otherworldly experience for me, who never wears a suit and finds these kinds of places usually intimidating. Picture"
JapanTravel,389ywl,bolt_krank,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"How was Amanohashidate? I know it's one of the Three Views, but honestly it looks like the least interesting of them. Just a natural sandbar with trees, which wouldn't look a whole lot different then coastline.  That onsen looks freaking amazing. (added to bucket list) Also I've seen a lot of people put Koyasan on their itineraries, but only now I finally see why."
JapanTravel,389ywl,nikorasu_the_great,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:02:56 2015 UTC,"Amanohashidate was great BUT the weather absolutely has to be good. Blue sea and blue sky are the whole point.   You can go on the sandbar with cheap rental bicycle, you can also take a boat tour.   But I get what you mean, it doesn't seem as ""grand"", as amazing, as Matsushima, a big bay with hundreds of islands, or the Torii in Miyajima which could be the cover picture for any tourism ad, and there's less to do overall, it's smaller.  It's still really beautiful, not at all like any other coastline. When you're on it, it's only like 40 meters wide, with sea on both sides, and you can rest (or even swim in summer) at any of the beaches along it. And when you see it from afar, the regularity of the little sandy bays is really exceptional.  Last but not least, if you're going with friends, everyone can have a fun time riding small rides at the mini amusement park located at the best point of view :D Guaranteed fun memories of getting there in the ""chairlift"", or watching the sandbar while riding the double bicycle ride ! (Like this and that)  But really, it has to be sunny."
JapanTravel,389ywl,bolt_krank,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:29:59 2015 UTC,"Hahaha oh wow, what is THAT? Neat contraption.  Good to know. The only thing that kind of sucks is the location is pretty far out from any typical itinerary. My friend made a special trip out there since he had the time, but it takes at least 3 hours from Shin-Osaka and there isn't much around it. I think he went alone and only just walked up and down the sandbar then took his 3 hour trip home.  Now I have to send him this photo and show him what he missed."
JapanTravel,389ywl,nikorasu_the_great,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:55:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say it's something you can do for instance if you're in Kyoto for a few days, a little bored of seeing temples, have already experienced Osaka... then maybe you can go there if you see that it's sunny. There are nice hotels and ryokans close to the sandbar too, I think, so it can be a 2-days side trip.  I was with 5 other people, we rented a car and went there for 2 days, in a nice (expensive) seaside hotel, it was pretty awesome. It was a change of pace from the train, and from the rest of the vacation which in Japan often feels like either very urban/modern, or very zen."
JapanTravel,389ywl,bolt_krank,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:01:48 2015 UTC,"Ah I know that feeling. That's what it was like when I was in Ibusuki. It's a hot spring town on the southern tip of Kagoshima but it's super small and I was there during something like an off-season. I can't imagine the population of the town being more than a couple thousand.  After riding on packed trains, fast shinkansens and walking through crowds of epic proportions in Tokyo, it was a peculiar feeling to be the only passenger on a bus in Ibusuki, driving through empty streets with hardly any traffic lights. It was so quiet and relaxing being next to the open ocean, I had entire beaches to myself. Even if I did see people, the chances they spoke English was next to none. I was definitely in the boonies."
JapanTravel,389ywl,nikorasu_the_great,4,Thu Jun 4 09:41:57 2015 UTC,"1) Hakodate, Hokkaido Prefecture.  The reason this small town's numero uno on my list is because it's my city (Halifax, Nova Scotia)'s sister city.   2) Tokyo  My personal reasons for going here is the sheer size of the city. I mean, the fact that you essentially have (in terms of populace) the entire population of Canada crammed into one megacity. As well, I hope to conquer Mount Fuji, and visit the Meiji Shrine as a Shinto.  3) Kobe  I plan to hit up Kobe sometime, as it's my drinking buddy's hometown. He's said some of the food there's pretty nice. Not to mention it's around the same size as my hometown."
JapanTravel,389ywl,bolt_krank,4,Tue Jun 2 23:03:48 2015 UTC,"If visiting Kansai, Kobe's a good base of operations, close to Osaka and Kyoto - with cheap accommodation. Also - within the city itself, everything is close."

JapanTravel,38d8hm,sedimentarycock,3,Wed Jun 3 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"If you are going to only take the shinkansen two times, will the JR pass be worth it? Also the JR pass isn't valid on the subway or metro anyway (though not required, you could get a prepaid IC card such as SUICA/ICOCA for convenience).  You might want to contact one of the places near you that sells the JR Pass (see here and scroll down to the ""Information regarding sales offices"" section) and ask if you can come down to their offices in person today to arrange a JR pass. Otherwise... it is probably going to be somewhat difficult. Technically it isn't possible to buy the JR pass in Japan although supposedly there are companies that will ship it to you there anyway."
JapanTravel,38d8hm,GHDpro,3,Wed Jun 3 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be snarky but have you done like any research at all... because this is one of the first things mentioned.   Anyways, some online retailers do ship to Japanese addresses. Also JR pass is obviously valid for JR trains. Generalising here, but the subway/metro in Tokyo has two main operators, Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway where you can't use the JR pass since they are different companies. There are more lines but I guess you won't be taking them or if yes, rarely.   There are day passes but most times they don't make sense. For convenience's sake, get an IC card.  Where do you go? For nationwide travel, there is Puratto Kodama and the E-voucher from Japanican (for Osaka/Kyoto from Tokyo). There are also regional rail passes available in Japan but I don't know where you will be staying so dunno what I could recommend."

We did want to explore rural japan for a day, and I'm worried that could get expensive fast without the rail pass."
JapanTravel,38d8hm,RealArc,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:16:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the price of a JR pass is slightly higher than a normal Shinkansen roundtrip Tokyo-Kyoto/Osaka. But three days is pushing it with ordering it online and shipping to Japan. If you live in city which has JTB tours offices they may have physical vouchers for you to pick up.  Other than that, cheapest Shinkansen travel is Puratto Kodama. Available in Japan, but you have to book at least a day ahead and it's fairly limited. But it's the slowest train.  Dunno what you mean with rural Japan (where exactly? Here are the regional rail passes, might be of use or not: http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html)  If that is too expensive, consider night buses or LCC. Might be some cheap last minute flights with Peach airlines.  Or pay outta your pocket. Depends on where you wanna go (distance involved, which kind of train; limited express or just a rapid express)."

So don't go through the hassle of trying to find one now, you shouldn't lose out. Even if you do, it won't be by much.  Some side-trip destinations are reached through private companies that are better alternatives than JR lines(and sometimes the only choice), like Kawaguchiko that can be reached by a cheap bus, Hakone (Odakyu romancecar), Nikko (Tobu railways)..."
JapanTravel,38d8hm,EMChamp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:09:15 2015 UTC,"You can buy shinkasen tickets at the JR rail counter, I know there's one in Tokyo and Kyoto station not sure of any others. For getting around subway in Tokyo you can get a Suica/Pasmo charge card from the card machines, they are in most major train stations and the airports. You need yen to charge those cards so acquire yen from your bank back home or get some at the airport for a higher rate. I forget if pasmo/suica works on Kyoto buses, I believe it does but I just got a 1 day pass for the buses instead."
JapanTravel,38d8hm,DrinkinMcGee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:47:58 2015 UTC,Grab a Sucia or Passmo card at just about any major station and throw $20 on it - it's a lot easier than buying tickets for each ride.
JapanTravel,38bzi5,OsamasSecretHideout,2,Wed Jun 3 06:09:37 2015 UTC,"Do you mean personally, or for people in general? If people, do you mean for residents or tourists?   For me, riding the Shinkansen, and other Japanese trains, are a big part of the travel experience of being in Japan so I will almost always prefer to use the Shinkansen where possible. Even for much longer distances than from Tokyo to Osaka. Especially as I usually plan trips around a JR Pass, or have enough travel that a JR Pass is worthwhile.     When making recommendations for other tourists I think it is a balance between time, budget, and the rest of the itinerary.    If you are on a tight budget use overnight buses. If you are on a tight budget and don't like overnight buses then try some of the LCCs for flights. If you are not on a budget and the distance is not too far then use Shinkansen. If you are not on a budget and the distance is far (like Osaka to Sapporo, or Tokyo to Fukuoka) then consider flying.   I think for people in Japan the rule of thumb is 4 hours is the tipping point between Shinkansen and flying although LCCs may be changing that. ie. less than 4 hours, take Shinkansen. Longer than 4 hours, fly."

JapanTravel,388nau,jdarby86,2,Tue Jun 2 16:59:01 2015 UTC,Both Tokyo Station and Narita Airport (possibly Haneda as well) have long term storage counters. It's not cheap. You might even want to consider sending it back and forth to yourself via Kuroneko. It might end up being the same price or less.  Edit: there's a few baggage storage places at Haneda as well.
JapanTravel,388nau,geekpondering,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"I did Kuroneko Takkyubin while I was there once and it's not expensive if you're just sending them to Osaka. It might be 4000 yen for a round trip for your luggage, but I can't confirm if that's cheaper than storage at the airport."
JapanTravel,389vki,Cow41087,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"General feedback:  I'm assuming the day trip to Nara Park includes Todaiji, etc. There's a bunch of temples all clustered around Nara Park there.  If you are going for geekery, you might want to do Nakano Broadway at the same time as Ghibli, and save Harajuku for your free day.   Based on travelers experiences, have I over, or underestimated the amount of time needed for each days activities?   Depending on how much time you want to spend in each place, etc, you can probably add more stuff to each day especially in Kyoto. Maybe do the 2 things on your list and have a few options if you still have time. I'd also verify that your places are all in the same area of town. It seems like you've generally done that, though.   What to do with large luggage going between Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto by shinkansen? TA-Q-BIN is an option, but doesn't seem like an efficient solution to me. Or, should I just risk taking it on the train?   If it's not too much of a hassle for you (if it's got rollers and isn't super-heavy), taking it on the train is fine. Shinkansen have separate luggage areas and it's generally not a problem if people have luggage even on local trains.   Any suggestions for free day?   As I said above, maybe do the Harajuku, Shibuya, Shinjuku area on your free day. It really sort of depends on what you are interested in. There's also Yoyogi Park/Meiji Jingu on that side of town, the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku, a number of other parks and touristy areas in Tokyo alone, not to mention maybe doing a day trip to Kamakura/Enoshima, Yokohama, Nikko, etc.  You definitely aren't going to run out of things to do in Tokyo and Kyoto. You'll run out of time and energy. Make a list of the things that are must-see for you, and then add other things in the same area to see if you have time."

If not, I would take a local train from Osaka Station to Kyoto, it's only 580¥ one way and takes an hour as opposed to 3000¥ and 20 minutes.   As for Kyoto,  You can do all these activities in a day - Fushimi Inari Taisha, Kiyomizu-dera, Higashiyama. Given that you arrive at Fushimi around 9-10am. This way, you can free a day up in Osaka. As /u/cuauhtlatoatzin said, I agree  on basing yourself in Osaka and taking side trips, saves the hassle of moving your bags all the time.  As for Nara, you can do the Deer Park and Todaiji in half a day. There's not much else there.  I would do Asakusa, Tokyo Skytree and then Akihabara on the same day. You should be able to do Tsukiji Fish Market, Asakusa, Skytree and then visit Akihabara in a day. Asakusa and the Skytree are very close by, I took a taxi there because I was lazy, from memory it was less than 1,500¥, or 15 minutes by train."

JapanTravel,3872bl,RealArc,11,Tue Jun 2 09:13:31 2015 UTC,"Either you are an experienced climber or you are extremely foolish and reckless to do this climb alone in the middle of winter.  There will be a lot of snow, strong winds, likely poor visibility and all huts will be closed. Underestimate a lonely windy mountain like Fuji and it will kill you."
JapanTravel,3872bl,I_AM_STILL_A_IDIOT,8,Tue Jun 2 11:47:08 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact that you are asking strangers on the internet (and on a region-based rather than climbing-based subreddit, no less), I'm going to make an assumption about your level of experience.  Don't worry, climbing Fuji in the winter is nothing unusual; people die on mountains all of the time.  They will just retrieve you in the spring.  In all seriousness, if you are inexperienced and climbing a mountain in poor conditions, you are risking more than just your own life, you are risking those of the people who may need to come to your aid.  You will likely also be financially liable.  Don't be an idiot, there's always another time you can climb it.  Come back in the summer."
JapanTravel,3872bl,ChefBoyAreWeFucked,7,Tue Jun 2 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"Unless you are an experienced climber, you do not need to be tracking up there.

JapanTravel,3872bl,Eternamente,7,Tue Jun 2 11:26:19 2015 UTC,"The average temperature of Mt. Fuji is -18.3C in winter. The average temperature of Mt Everest is -20 towards the end of May, when many people complete their ascent. So, you'll be facing near-Everest temperatures and conditions, sans the altitude.  Climbing in this type of weather will probably require a significant investment in gear, including but not limited to a full alpine suit($700+), waterproof mountaineering boots (400$+), snow shoes and crampons (there will be ice and snow), GPS equipment (trails will likely be buried under snow), basic first-aid kit and maybe even a small-ish oxygen tank. You probably would also want something like flares, because chances of getting lost or dead are high.  You're also going to want to acquire some training in assessing avalanche risk. Fuji is steep and smooth with little vegetation. There is usually one avalanche per year, from what I can tell. I guess you'll just have to roll the dice. You'll also want some training in navigating mountainous terrain, because the trail will be under lots of snow.  You should also be in pretty good shape. The road to 5th station is closed during the winter, so I think you may have to start at the base of the mountain, which means you'll be gaining the same elevation as Mt. Everest Base Camp to Summit.  OP, you're basically planning a baby Everest ""hike,"" and your friends are correct, this is a dumb idea.  Good luck!"

Japanese people often consider it rude to ask you for ID unless you actually seem suspicious, so we never got carded. Had plenty of opportunities, so it was never a problem.  To be safe, we avoided drinking in Irish pubs, and at hotels where they had his passport on record, just in case. From what I hear, you will almost certainly be carded at clubs though, so avoid them. Restaurants and regular bars should be fine.  Drink at Izakaya - great atmosphere, great food, good booze and wonderful service. They won't ask for your ID, at least as far as my experience/research goes.  If you happen to buy alcohol from a convenience store (very cheap, great if you're just going to be chilling at the hostel or whatever), there is a screen which pops up at the till, asking you if you are at least twenty, then to press either はい or いいえ. The assistant will almost never ask for your ID, and just ask you to press the yes button.  If you're ever in doubt, don't bother. Plenty of fun to be had without drinking! Good luck, and have an awesome trip!"

Both are possible as day trips from Sapporo. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6706.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6894.html    Note that accommodation in Sapporo will need to be booked well in advance. Friday and Saturday nights can be a bit more expensive also.    You can also consider incorporating other places in Hokkaido. I assume you don't plan on skiing/snowboarding? Places to consider are maybe Noboribetsu, Hakodate, and if you want something different and don't mind a lot of travel on trains then Abashiri to see the pack/drift ice from the icebreaker boats can be very interesting. Abashiri was one of our highlights when we went to Hokkaido for the Sapporo Snow Festival. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6865.html http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1101.html    There's plenty of other snow-related places that you may wish to include in your trip.

JapanTravel,380wfk,david_131,2,Mon Jun 1 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that it is much more cost effective to use a JR pass for intercity travel rather than domestic flights?   No, not at all. It really depends on what your exact itinerary is. Don't underestimate the time factor either. Using day time trains with a JR pass it will take around 12.5 hours to get from Kyoto to Sapporo for example. Even if you had an active JR Pass it may be worthwhile just flying from Kansai Airport (Osaka) to New Chitose (Sapporo) to save a lot of time.      I mean I'm definitely going to have a JR pass for my trip so I may as well use it right?     Whether or not you need a JR Pass or which length JR Pass will suit you will depend completely on your itinerary. Given your current list of Tokyo Kyoto Sapporo Kyoto over a month you could travel for significantly less by flying each leg compared to a 21-day JR Pass for example.  Sometimes you can make your itinerary fit a JR Pass but usually I suggest you plan out at least a rough itinerary and then it is easier to advise what JR Pass, if any, will suit.    Note that I am not saying that you won't benefit from a JR Pass, I'm just saying that can't be determined until you work out at least a rough itinerary."
JapanTravel,380wfk,david_131,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I plan on doing that before I start asking any more questions. We plan on making a fair few day trips from each ""base"" location which is why I felt the JR pass necessary."

I do think that you're spending way too much time in Tokyo (9 nights is a long time). It's especially a long time if you're looking to see the countryside and you've already been before."
JapanTravel,381lkv,david_131,2,Mon Jun 1 06:23:16 2015 UTC,"Our goal this time is to see more of the Japanese country side and some smaller, out of the way places.     How much of a priority is this though? You seem to have a lot allocated for Osaka, Fukuoka, and especially Tokyo?    Do you have specific reasons for the order? The Shirakawago - Nikko section seems really awkward/time-consuming to me. I would be inclined to go from Shirakawago to maybe Kanazawa and back to Osaka, then fly from Osaka to Sapporo to Tokyo. Then just do Nikko at the start or in the middle of the Tokyo stay. You could also consider including some other places in the area near Shirakawago if you prefer. Maybe Hida-Furukawa near Takayama for example. Fukui, Eihiji on the way back toward Osaka perhaps. You could even spend more time and explore north of Kanazawa on the Noto Peninsula.    With your current list it may make more sense to go Kyoto - (Kanazawa) - Shirakawago - Kamikochi - (Matsumoto) - Kiso Valley. Then continue on to an airport for a flight to Sapporo.    What do you plan on doing in Sapporo? You may be able to see some autumn colours in Hokkaido depending on what date you include Sapporo:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014_when.html    What do you plan on doing in Fukuoka?

JapanTravel,380wcr,similarities,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:33:14 2015 UTC,The thing about Tokyo is that the public transportation is so good that staying near bars isn't as big of a deal unless you plan on drinking until the subways stop running.  I stayed in Ebisu which is one stop south of Shibuya. Airbnb rooms were $50 cheaper a night. Bars  Izakayas are everywhere so it was worth staying one stop away to save cash which I then spent on food.

JapanTravel,37xry0,laryrose,2,Sun May 31 21:53:21 2015 UTC,Way too ambitious. You essentially have twelve and a half days once you're out of the airport and when you need to be at the airport for your return.
JapanTravel,37xry0,aentee,2,Sun May 31 07:52:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds quite packed, I'm going for a similar itinerary (minus Nagasaki and Nagoya, instead going to Takayama - Shirakawago - Kanazawa), but with 22 days.  Even with that amount of time, I get a lot of feedback saying we will have to rush a bit."
JapanTravel,37xry0,adam_364,2,Sun May 31 08:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you've already been in those cities, why are you going again?

JapanTravel,37xry0,laryrose,2,Sun May 31 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"We just went for 2 weeks, flew into NRT Sunday night, Tokyo until Friday, Kyoto 2 nights, Hiroshima 2 nights, Nagoya 4 nights, back to Tokyo 1 night then left. It was busy, but we saw a lot. 2 week JR pass definitely worth it. I guess it depends how much you want to do in each city.  My opinion would be too ambitious, but doable."

JapanTravel,37xry0,thened,2,Mon Jun 1 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"What pace of travel do you prefer? Do you have a rough idea now of how many days you want in each of the cities? Are you limited by a budget at all? I think your plan is possible/reasonable depending on some of your answers to the above. If you are not limited by budet I would strongly consider flying from Narita to Fukuoka or Kagoshima. Jetstar Japan have a cheap early morning flight to Kagoshima on the 18th which may suit you for example. Then you can just work your way back toward Tokyo without any backtracking. If you enjoy train travel then I would just split the journey up so that you have relatively small hops between cities. Using your current list as an example I would do:- Tokyo - Kyoto - Kobe - Fukuoka - Kagoshima - Nagasaki - Hiroshima - Osaka - Tokyo. 14-day JR Pass pays off probably no matter which way you tackle it but there might be a few other options if you fly direct to Kagoshima/Fukuoka depending on your exact itinerary. Depends a bit on how long you spend on Kyushu. There are lots of good ryokan/onsen in Kyushu so I would probably do that there. Kurokawa, Yufuin, Beppu, etc. I would start by listing all dates including day of the week and then place the city you plan on being in next to each date to see if you can make it fit."
JapanTravel,37xry0,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. To answer your questions, I usually do a leisurely pace (mostly because traveling with others), but am willing to speed things up to make it work (went through 5 cities in Italy/Switzerland in 6 days earlier this year).   I'm not 100% sure how much time I want to spend in each city -- enough time to take pictures and enjoy some food would be good. To that extent, I don't expect to spend a full day in some cities (e.g. Hiroshima I just want to see the peace memorial museum and maybe Itsukushima). I believe one of the nice things about the JR pass is that I'll be able to make these short stops without extra expense.  In terms of budget, most self-imposed. I think I see the flight you mentioned (6190 yen) and that's not bad at all. I think I will aim to primarily use shinkansen (I personally enjoy the long rides haha and it gives me a chance to nap), but will definitely keep the flights as an option.   I like the order you've suggested so here's what I'm thinking: 6/17: stay around Tokyo  6/18: wake up early, Tsukiji if I feel like it (not a big deal, already been twice), sushi in the area. Around noon by this point, hop on the shinkansen and head to Nagoya as I haven't been there before. Hang around for a few hours, shinkansen to Kyoto and stay there for the night.  6/19: (Already spent extensive time in Kyoto/Osaka/nearby on previous trips) Breakfast in Kyoto, head over to Nara to hang out with the deer for an hour or so (already been), late lunch with friends in Osaka, head to Kobe for dinner (any recommendations on affordable Kobe beef haha?), sleep somewhere either in Kobe or Osaka...  6/20: Catch earliest train to Fukuoka, eat Hakata ramen, check out the city for a few hours.  Here, my unfamiliarity with Kyushu makes me a little less certain. Can head to either Nagasaki or Kagoshima, spend the rest of day and stay there for the night. I think this would also be an ideal time for ryokan/onsen.  6/21: Head to either Nagasaki or Kagoshima (whichever I don't do for 6/20), explore for a few hours. Head to Hiroshima to see peace memorial museum and Itsukushima). Could either stay the night or catch a later shinkansen back to Osaka area.  6/22-30: ????? As you can see, essentially covered all of the cities I had listed out already. Obviously, some of those train connections might be tight and I may want to spend more time in certain cities, but there's still almost a week left after accounting for that.  Does that sound reasonable to you?  Truth is, I have never been further west than Osaka, so I don't know that much about the Kyushu region. That said, I'm really trying to hit some of the cities in the area to get an idea of what might be interesting for future visits. Are there particular cities you would recommend spending more time in as opposed to a quick visit?"
JapanTravel,37xry0,Gurtang,3,Mon Jun 1 00:51:23 2015 UTC,It is faster to get to Kagoshima than Nagasaki because you can take the JR Kyushu Shinkansen to Nagasaki. You can also stop in Kumamoto along the way and check out the castle there. Fukuoka itself doesn't have a lot to offer tourists but I think going to a Yatai at night is one of the best experiences you can have in Japan.
JapanTravel,37xry0,einar77,2,Mon Jun 1 01:27:44 2015 UTC,With 14 days the pass will be worth it since you're making a pretty far found trip.
JapanTravel,37xry0,amyranthlovely,1 point,Sun May 31 08:10:30 2015 UTC,So you have twelve days and 8-9 cities + onsen trip + fuji. Impossible.   You can either go less far or leave things out.
JapanTravel,37xm18,melbsng,2,Sun May 31 06:26:56 2015 UTC,"If you're planning to stay in Western Japan, why not look into the area passes instead--http://online.jtbusa.com/JRpass/JRWest.aspx The trains are faster and available for a shorter time period. I think the Sanyo-San'in pass goes from any of those areas in Kansai to as far as Hakata."
JapanTravel,37xm18,tkshy,2,Sun May 31 17:39:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for your suggestion! It's much cheaper to buy the JR West pass and there are no restrictions to the type of Shinkansen!

JapanTravel,37xm18,david_131,2,Mon Jun 1 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"So, two days for Hiroshima + Miyajima? Maybe a day for Fukuoka? A day for Onomichi. Leaves you three days I guess. I'd either incorporate a little bit of Kyushu. Maybe Yufuin/Beppu, Nagasaki. Or Kagashima, Mt Aso, Kurokawa. Maybe Takachiho?    Or I'd look at including a bit of Shikoku. Maybe Shimanami Kaido, or if you don't want to do that you could maybe just include Matsuyama and Takamatsu. You could also consider coming back via Shodoshima which is pretty well connected by ferries. Some people may consider Okunoshima for the rabbits.    Or just see some places nearby like Himeji, Kurashiki, Bitchu Takahashi, Okayama, etc."

JapanTravel,37xjyi,jacques-93,3,Sun May 31 06:00:27 2015 UTC,"If it's just clothes and stuff, it might be worth pricing out at a post office to see if it's cheaper to send back. My guess is it will still end up being more expensive than just buying another cheap bag ($10) and paying to check an extra bag ($25). I can't see it being cheaper than $40-$50 to ship something back to Australia. Especially if you want it sooner than 2 or so months from now."
JapanTravel,37xjyi,vexillifer,1 point,Sun May 31 07:59:16 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking. I was just under the impression that if you went over the allotted baggage limit all airlines are going to charge you through the nose. If it's only approx $25 I guess that's not too bad.
JapanTravel,37xjyi,david_131,1 point,Sun May 31 08:39:12 2015 UTC,Potentially flying with Air China and had a look at the pricing on extra baggage. It's around an extra $70 USD to take 1 more bag. So may be worth looking into sending things home.

JapanTravel,37wvpp,ukatama,1 point,Sun May 31 03:53:28 2015 UTC,Cool. That's what I thought. I know if I went at night I'd would not want to catch the last train etc. My fav time to explore is late at night.  I figure since landing at Haneda is an option I might as well give it a go.   So it is officially 'penciled in'.
JapanTravel,37wvpp,unitwhy,1 point,Sun May 31 15:29:32 2015 UTC,You would probably save some money on hotels and train fare.  The hotel should be cheaper in Yokohama than staying in Shinjuku.  So two days in Yokohama is probably ok if you are going to go there anyway.
JapanTravel,37w109,user414,3,Sat May 30 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"All of the ticket machines have English options and are pretty easy to figure out. There are also a ton of videos on YouTube of people showing you how to use the machines if you like to plan ahead. Most of the ticket office personnel speak English, or passable English. Or you can just write down the city you want to go to, around the time you want to leave. It ends up working out through written instructions, drawings and hand signals.  I'd say either option has about equal amounts of hassle.  Reserved seating: If you have a JR Pass and want to get a reserved seat, you will have to go to a JR Ticket counter to show your Pass to get the reserved ticket with an assigned seat. Otherwise, without the pass, you can just use a ticket machine to get a reserved ticket which can be faster and more convenient than going to the JR ticket office. However if you are nervous about using a machine on your own you will probably use the ticket offices with staff anyway.   Non-reserved seating: If you have a JR Pass you can just go through the manned turnstiles and jump on any non-reserved Shinkansen car w/o a ticket (just show your pass when the ticket checker comes by), but if you are traveling during heavy/holiday periods it is recommended that you get a reserved seat.   Other Pros: The JR Pass makes for a nice souvenir.  Other Cons: You could lose the JR Pass and it's not replaceable/refundable.  I've travelled with and without it. I'd say unless you are going to have a large savings by using the Pass, just buy individual tickets. You won't have to worry about losing it and you won't have to wait in long lines to trade the voucher in for the pass (I've waited almost 2 hours for this before) or at the ticket offices to get reserved tickets."
JapanTravel,37w109,xinganbaobei,1 point,Sat May 30 23:20:43 2015 UTC,You can't take a reserved seat at a machine with the JR pass.   I'd go with the JR pass for the convenience.  That way you can also decide to make side trips in shinkansen.
JapanTravel,37w109,Gurtang,1 point,Sun May 31 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply this. I see where the confusion is, edited for clarification."
JapanTravel,37w109,xinganbaobei,1 point,Sun May 31 02:52:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Your input is super helpful.  Also, on my return trip from Kyoto to NRT. What time do you think I should head out of Kyoto at to safely make my return flight at NRT which departs at 5:25PM?"
JapanTravel,37w109,xinganbaobei,1 point,Sun May 31 00:56:32 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, but you might look into changing your flight to leave from Kansai airport. It might end up costing less to change your flight than to pay for a Shinkansen ticket back to Tokyo. I once did it and it was only $100 charge to change my flight. Totally worth it.  In any case, if you want to arrive at NRT 2 hours ahead of time for an international flight, that puts you at 3:25pm arrival, so just work backwards. It's about 1.5 hour trip from Shinagawa to Narita. (You can also transfer to the NRT express at Tokyo station but I think Shinagawa station is easier to navigate.) Kyoto to Shinagawa is about 2 hours. Maybe leave an hour early just in case? So I'd shoot for a departing 11am train, 12pm at the very latest. If you decide to transfer in Tokyo station, give yourself extra time as getting around in that station is a bit of a nightmare when you don't want to miss a flight! You could also leave Kyoto super early, stash your luggage in a locker, have a relaxing lunch, do some last minute shopping, then head to the airport.  Oh, one other benefit of not getting the JR Pass is you shave 30 minutes off of your Tokyo-Kyoto trip because you can ride the Nozomi train which has fewer stops."

JapanTravel,37w109,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Sun May 31 00:52:01 2015 UTC,That is a good deal. Usually it's not that much more though. Perhaps Canada is not so connected to Osaka  Although it might still have been cheaper to fly to Tokyo via discount airline
JapanTravel,37w109,Gurtang,1 point,Sun May 31 02:06:47 2015 UTC,Why would they be restricted by the pass... The pass is obviously for inter city travel. It's just a plus inner city when you happen to take à Jr line but you have to get a suica TOO anyway. (and maybe a bus pass for kyoto). It's unrelated.

You can drop by a convenience store, which I'm sure you will many times while you're in Japan, and check out the quality yourself. Also, I imagine good wagashi isn't going to last long. You could also try going to the bottom of certain department stores where they have nice basements full of food places. I know mitsukoshi in ginza has one for sure. Lots of good food packaged nicely... but I don't know the storage life for that either and some things are a little pricey.."

The first 'X' seats sold are anchor tickets, expensive enough to make sure people won't change their plans and to pay for the flight only selling out at Y% so they don't loose as much in fee's and fuel costs.  Generally buying airline tickets are cheapest 14 days to 21 days before the flight.  You can also pick up fairly cheap '48 hour tickets' if you're flexible."

Best to be there before 2 though.. because people start packing up at like 2pm when I was there. Overall I spent like an hour and 15 mins there. I feel like I could've stayed longer if I got there earlier before people started packing up. Maybe 2x the time.  Also try this: http://furima.fmfm.jp/?area_id=103&pref_id=48"
JapanTravel,37uyk4,knightframe,3,Sat May 30 16:46:48 2015 UTC,What's the rest of your itinerary? I assume you have extra luggage from somewhere else which you don't need during your time in Japan? If you stay somewhere in between then it may be cheaper/easier to just ship twice (or three times). You can specify a delivery date up to 7 days in advance with most takuhaibin services at no additional charge. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html

The bar was featured in the film Lost in Translation (2003). The view was spectacular. Note: There is a ¥2,200 cover charge per person after 20:00 if you are not a hotel guest. Also, as you'd expect, everything is very expensive. ¥1,800 for most cocktails, and appetizers run ¥1,800 to ¥4,600. But the cost of two drinks was definitely worth the experience.  [We just got back from Japan two weeks ago and watched the film again. SO much fun recognizing parts of Tokyo and Kyoto we had just visited!]  The view from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building was also great. (And it's free.)  We also enjoyed the Meiji Shrine. If you can go on a weekend day, you might get lucky and see a wedding. We were really lucky and saw a wedding on a Tuesday!  Have a great time!"

You can look at any of the major orgs that hire teachers overseas: JET, etc. You can also look at teaching at an eikawa (english tutor).   Probably the best thing to do is search for 'alt' in /r/japan for more information."

Perhaps out of the 15 that I've talked to in my city alone, only one is expected to just repeat (it's a new position so her schools don't really know how to best utilize her).  I teach fifteen and a half lessons a week; nine and a half of those are completely taught and designed solely by myself and six are team-teaching classes where I design a teaching presentation and reinforcing activity while the teacher explains in Japanese. This is similar for the other 14 JETs in my city.   I also teach an eikaiwa and it's completely run by me. Just some food for thought."

JapanTravel,37obzk,Ansalem,1 point,Fri May 29 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"I 1000% percent agree. Travel to a developed country like Japan is going to be pretty seamless, and easy with a little research.

I see both sides of the coin though, just dont want to screw anything up"
JapanTravel,37obzk,azaizai,3,Fri May 29 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"I just realized this is long, I promise I'm not giving you crap for wanting a travel agent, I really just want to help.  I looked into getting a travel agent initially before planning my trip. MOST of the travel agents I talked to (local) said they rarely had anyone go, and would only recommend pre-planned tour packages, like the kind you get through Japanican or JTB.....I suspect they were trying to sell me those plans with an upcharge. You may have better luck than me with travel agents, but even then, they'll upcharge you their fee.  That said, you can literally plan your entire trip with help from this subreddit and Japan-Guide.  Going to Japan was the first time I've been to another country (outside the U.S.), very sad. I knew only a few phrases, and at the end of the day, everything worked out great.  I saw some of what you wanted to go do posted below, it's fairly typical from itineraries I've seen here.  I saw some of the activities you want to do, two weeks is a fairly typical Japan trip, you'll see most of the things in Tokyo/Kyoto, and usually 1-2 other places (Osaka?).   You can trivially get anywhere you want in the country using a Pocket Wifi device (look it up, search this sub for vendor suggestions) and Google Maps. The transportation system is fantastic there.  The specifics of where to stay in each city don't really matter that much, as long as you're close to a train station. I booked ""home bases"" in Tokyo & Kyoto on AirBnb, in Tokyo, we were a 5 minute walk to the train, and from there, we could get anywhere in Tokyo in 15-40 minutes. (Depending on where we went). Trains run 5am-midnight, like clockwork, not only are they convenient and on-time, they are frequent, every 2-3 minutes in most places.  Start planning now, set aside 2-3 hours on a weekend and just look up everything, ask questions here. You'll be much happier and save a ton of money."
JapanTravel,37obzk,reol7x,2,Fri May 29 13:54:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being so well-reasoned and polite, I don't feel like you're giving me crap at all. :)"

JapanTravel,37obzk,Vagabond_Sam,2,Sat May 30 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"Typically the Japanese based agents are best for this. JTB, HIS for example.   But, without being able to walk into a store to sit and chat it may be frustrating to vet itineraries and email back feedback for changes for both of you.   As for any general International Travel Agency, extensive Japan knowledge is fairly limited and also the contacts with local tourism and hotels is much more limited then what is available at the large on-line sites.   If you're dead set on just not doing any planning yourself, checking the set itinerary options you have on offer from the tour companies is really the best way to go. You do pay a premium for the convenience though as I can do most of those itineraries myself for at least 30% less.   If you post here a guideline of where you want to go and what sort of things you are interested in you may find some help that will get you started."
JapanTravel,37obzk,Vagabond_Sam,0,Fri May 29 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"Well I'd like to go in February or March of 2017. I realize I'm planning early, lol, but I'd rather that than leave things to the last minute.   Some things I want to see:  Sanrio Puroland (I think in my research I found this is more practical than Harmonyland because that's off on an island)  The Ghibli Museum and/or the Totoro house  Shrines and castles, especially if you can go inside, and they have omikuji (if I'm in Kyoto  I have Kitano Tenmangu Shrine written down)  Hina Matsuri if I'm there at the right time  I kind of want to see Akihabara but I'm not keen on huge crowds, so maybe DenDen Town instead  Pop-up character cafes (like the Sanrio or Sailor Moon ones; since they seem to only stay open for a few months this may need to wait until closer to trip time)  Maybe Harajuku to see the fashion  Visit a Daiso location (don't laugh, I'm nowhere near their only US stores in California)  I would love to see or stay in a room with tatami mats at least once."
JapanTravel,37obzk,laryrose,1 point,Fri May 29 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Like I said. Cheaper to do it yourself and it seems the things you want to do are sufficently accessible for even a first time traveller to easily plan.   I would suggest planning your flights as an open jaw return. Rarely is there a significant cost to fly into one city and out of the other. So fly into to Osaka Kansai, and out of Tokyo.   Alternatively, travelling in Feburary to the north is really stunning in the winter snow. You can fly cheap from Tokyo to Sapporro and try to get there for the winter festival where they make huge outdoor ice sculptures.   North of Tokyo, near Sendai is a hot spring resort in a small village called Zao. A rare phenomenon of trees collecting snow and ice are called 'Winter Monsters' and are pretty stunning too. Also a good place to experience the Ryokans with Tatami mat rooms and traditional Japanese hospitality.   DOing this you could spend half your trip doing some of these unique, seasonal things and the other half doing the Tokyo centric, perennially japanese stuff like Daiso and cat cafes.  Edit  I realised you asked for budget.  For two people here's a rough guideline   $70 a night per person for three star private accommodation. Can be done cheaper for 2 star private for $30-40 per night, even less for hostels $35 a day on food. Takeaway ramen, izakaya and simple, but tasty food.  $10 a day on transport (Usually cheaper, but good to budget higher) $50 spending money. Covers attarctions, gifts and little stuff like that. Again a number I use and often spend it in larger amounts on the way home getting Japanese collectables, or gifts.  Travelling Between Tokyo and Kyoto $150 each direction"
JapanTravel,37obzk,laryrose,1 point,Fri May 29 04:38:08 2015 UTC,Holy shit you're planning this trip for well over a year and a half in the future?  You'll be wasting your money and time by going through a travel agent. Seriously. Some tours are great but most don't let you really experience a ton of stuff outside of crowds and gift shops.
JapanTravel,37obzk,CallingYouOut2,-1,Fri May 29 06:30:20 2015 UTC,"That's why I wanted one to do a custom itinerary. Also it's not like I'm already making reservations or anything but if I have to do it myself I'm going to have to research hotels, find out how far it is in between everything, find out how to take the train, etc. It's a daunting task."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,GreyToad,4,Thu May 28 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I'll answer a few of your Qs.  Q1 : Yes, not a problem unless your plane is seriously delayed. The last train that will get you to Akihabara is after 11pm.  Q2 : Not hectic, but indeed dropping Osaka would be a good idea. There is simply too much to see in Kyoto and 2 days is not enough.  Q3 : bath, eat, sleep, eat (and a few other baths if you want). And no, Hakone is not a good place to hike Fuji (it's actually quite far)    Q4 : Yes, but keep in mind that an area around Owakudani in Hakone is currently closed due to volcanic activity. Check the situation from time to time."

Trains run until 11-midnightish, so I think you'll be ok making Akihabara unless you were delayed."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,Envelopered,2,Fri May 29 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"The price for the ryokan listed on that site are, I believe, per person. Not sure if that's your budget per person or total but it's good to take note. For example I recently requested for a quote for that ryokan and they said it was about 16,000 yen per person for a total of 32,000, and it didn't have a private onsen."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,ukatama,1 point,Fri May 29 02:02:52 2015 UTC,Thanks! I am aware of the Ryokan's high price. It's one of the parts on the trip where we will spend lavishly.

Is that correct?   Google Maps is correct; your reading of it is not.  The Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen is operated by JR.  So everything but the subways in Nagoya are JR-compatible."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,raincheckonreality,1 point,Fri May 29 03:15:35 2015 UTC,"I see. Thanks for your help!  I looked at the google maps again, but unfortunately am still a bit confused on how to read their instructions. When I click on a route and ""details"" for the route breakdown, the ""JR"" logo only stands next to a small portion of the trip (eg Akihabara to Shinagawa) station. Is that the correct way to read their map? Also for the ""cost"" they list, is it possible to extract out what portion of that is covered by the JR pass?"
JapanTravel,37mlj7,raincheckonreality,2,Fri May 29 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Whereever you stay, make sure to find out how late they accept check-ins. With a flight landing at 9, after customs, waiting for a train and getting to your accomodations, you may not be there til 11.  I think you can absolutely drop Osaka to spend more time in Kyoto.  A ryokan is basically a bed and breafast with no activities, japanese style. Nothing more, nothing less.  If you're the kind of person who truly likes nature and hiking, ABSOLUTELY climb Fiji, and try to climb through the night so you can catch the sunrise, which is unreal."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,raincheckonreality,1 point,Fri May 29 03:56:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice! Hiking at night to catch the sunrise on Mt Fuji might be too hardcore for our group. Wouldn't you need some pretty good gear to endure the extreme weather?
JapanTravel,37mlj7,raincheckonreality,2,Fri May 29 17:39:25 2015 UTC,Try using a site called hyperdia.com to figure out times and costs for travel. I find that google maps isn't the best at figuring out the optimal route.
JapanTravel,37mlj7,Adderkleet,1 point,Fri May 29 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This site might just be exactly what I need. I think I get the interface but am hoping you can help explain some things I don't understand.  This example itinerary from Narita to Akihabara for instance.   When a seat fee is specified does it mean we can save money by standing? In this particular itinerary, we would have to spend an additional 290 yen outside of a JR pass? But the rest is covered?"
JapanTravel,37mlj7,Adderkleet,2,Fri May 29 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"Also, you don't need to worry about getting SUICA or any other special payment. Those cards are usually just for convenience. It is quite easy to just buy tickets from the station."
JapanTravel,37mlj7,sbFRESH,1 point,Fri May 29 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer your questions:   seat fees are usually used for special express and bullet trains. Usually you can pay less for an unreserved fee, but i don't think you can avoid it by standing. For local trains (like on your example) there are no seat fees.  yes, I think you would have to pay for anything that is not JR. JR runs the bullet trains and some local trains. Occasionally there will be railroads run by private companies like Kintetsu in Nagoya and Mie-ken. The JR pass will not cover these trains.    Edit: corrected formatting"
JapanTravel,37mlj7,Gurtang,1 point,Fri May 29 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Hope you don't mind if I ask you a few more. In this example itinerary from Akihabara to Nagoya.   ""JR"" is only listed in front of the ""Yamanote Line"", while the ""Shinkansen nozomi 21"" does not have ""JR"" in front of it. Does the JR pass still cover this trip? And what's the best way to know that a route is JR covered? For special express and bullet trains, how does one buy the ""unreserved fee""? Do you just buy it at the counter when you want to board?"
JapanTravel,37mlj7,Adderkleet,2,Fri May 29 20:49:16 2015 UTC,"The JR pass covers all bullet trains except for the Nozomi line (which is the fastest line). I think you can uncheck that line in the options box on hyperdia.  And from what I understand, the JR pass covers the seat fee, so you can reserve a seat at the station for free once you have your pass. As long as you are not travelling during Japanese holidays, you should be fine even without a reserved seat."
JapanTravel,37kp64,Centurion89,21,Thu May 28 09:45:03 2015 UTC,"Always bring your passport with you wherever you go. A surprising number of things require you to have it available, and you don’t want to miss out on tax-free shopping just because you left your passport in your hotel room. You also need it if you’re picking up a JR pass.   No, it is a legal requirement for foreign nationals to carry their passport or Japanese resident card at ALL times. If stopped by police without a passport or resident card, a foreigner can potentially face temporary detention.  This is the primary reason why you should carry your passport, while travelling in Japan."
JapanTravel,37kp64,gisdaman,1 point,Thu May 28 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I never realized that. Luckily after forgetting my passport the first time, I just started to carry it around with me all the time. Thanks for the feedback!"
JapanTravel,37kp64,kaseijin64,-4,Thu May 28 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"I actually don't carry my passport with me all the time unless I know I am going to need it.   A lost passport is a pain to get replaced, and I figure that is a more likely scenario than getting stopped by the police. So I always make copies and keep those in my wallet while the real passport stays in the Hotel.   Legally you aren't supposed to do this, but my experience in Japan tells me that if I am stopped and asked to produce my passport, facing a short detention or having to go back to the hotel to retrieve it is less of a hassle than getting a new passport."
JapanTravel,37kp64,gisdaman,2,Thu May 28 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"I have the unfortunate fact that I have a resting Asian thug face, when travelling solo.  Number of ID checks:   Trip 1: 6 Trip 2: 3 Trip 3: 1, and landed me 3 hours at the koban (police station).   Did nothing wrong, except looking too badass by default at 2am in the morning. My accommodation was in the red light district (heck, it was a repurposed former love hotel), and I was about to cross the road for a meal at a 24-hour diner.  Good thing that I had a passport on me, otherwise I'd probably be there for more than half a day."
JapanTravel,37kp64,magnus91,2,Fri May 29 03:28:57 2015 UTC,You should include a section about common Japanese sayings.
JapanTravel,37kp64,GHDpro,2,Thu May 28 10:54:17 2015 UTC,"About SUICA/PASMA: that's great advice, except when you arrive in Japan somewhere other than Tokyo (ie: Kansai Airport), as SUICA/PASMO can only be purchased there (unless I missed something). You can buy an ICOCA card in the Kansai area that will work the same as SUICA and may even have great compatibility than SUICA (source). While it is fine not to go into whether a JR pass is worth it, I should mention that like SUICA/PASMO/ICOCA another factor should be considered: convenience has value too, and not having to buy tickets all the time can be a great thing. If you have a Meastro compatible bankcard, you can use it at all Japan Post Office ATMs. But be aware that these ATMs tend to be inside, and post offices have opening hours. If your bank limits using ATMs outside your country (anti-fraud measure) be sure to ask them to turn this off during your stay in Japan (forgot this once...)."

We were fine in Kyoto because our son, who lives there and is fluent in Japanese, spent 9 days showing us around. But once we were on our own in Tokyo -- hoo boy, did we feel lost!   I didn't have time to research much (beyond what we wanted to see) ahead of time. Our biggest mistake was not figuring out up front that there were ways to have affordable wifi, so we had no internet access. Using the metro and finding places by address would have been SO much easier that way, as would communicating with non-English speakers via translator apps have been as well.   Our son isn't planning on moving back to the US for at least two more years (if ever) so we'll likely visit Japan again. Lesson learned..."

However they are everywhere so if you're not into a factory tour/museum of toys the trip may not be worth it and you'll see those cookies for sale everywhere.   I think it's the 'JR tower' (please double check if this is appealing) where at the top they have what are considered to be the current 'best' ramen restaurants from around Hokkaido where you can try their specialities. The salt ramen is a must try. In one of the shopping halls, underground, there is a bakery that sells the seasons best desserts from the best bakeries in Hokkaido too.   Part of what I love about Japan is the food so that's why there's so many food stops . Susukino also has 'Ramen Alley' and the other local speciality is Mongolian style beef.

JapanTravel,37ieww,PushingIce,2,Wed May 27 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"If you got some spare time in Kyoto I suggest visiting Heian Shrine or Nijo Castle, or taking a walk through some of the historic roads near Kiyomizu / Gion / Ponto-cho"
JapanTravel,37ieww,wggn,2,Wed May 27 21:52:32 2015 UTC,"JR pass usefulness may be limited. Generally it only pays out if you mak emore then three long rail trips. You should be able to do some googling to find the prices of the trips you're making and compare it to your itinerary. Google maps shows Prices for trains and is 13,910 yen for Kyoto > Tokyo right now. So jump on there and add up all your trips.   Seeing Kyoto by bike is a great way to get around too.  7/6 You can walk from Shibuya to Harajuku via Yoyogi park  Edit  As a former travel agent, in Australia you would not have time to get a JR Pass within a day. I doubt it's an option unless whereever you are has a very different way of having JR passess mailed out.   They are usually ticketed by a central office and sent out to the agents that sell them as they are unique and printed to your passport details, the passport forming part of the ticket validation each time you use it."
JapanTravel,37ieww,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Wed May 27 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"In France at least, you can just walk in some travel agencies and they make the voucher for you, instantly.  But you're right, he won't need it anyway."

JapanTravel,37ieww,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Wed May 27 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"As a former travel agent, in Australia you would not have time to get a JR Pass within a day.    Really? I have purchased different JR Passes multiple times from different agencies on the same day with no issues. Most of the official JR Pass agencies can handle this fine. eg. JTB, HIS, etc. Maybe Flight Centre can't do it same day but if you are in a capital city especially on the east coast it is not an issue."
JapanTravel,37ieww,david_131,1 point,Thu May 28 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Brisbane. Took a day or two.   I think exceptions were occasionally made for emergencies and the CBD stores had more leeway as they could walk to the office they were handled, but I would never sell one the day before travel because they were non refundable and one delay could be disaster to someone holiday.   Maybe the Japanese agencies like JTB and HIS can do it I guess."
JapanTravel,37ieww,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Thu May 28 02:06:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Japanese agencies like JTB and HIS can do it I guess.     Correct, that's what I'm saying."

It's hard to imagine 'Get your Rail Pass with time to spare' as bad advice in need of correction"

JapanTravel,37ieww,Sunset_Tea,1 point,Thu May 28 05:28:12 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Ueno Park in Tokyo, especially all of the awesome museums. I only got to see the National Science Museum while I was there (which I would highly recommend), but there is also the Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum for Western Art, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. Ueno Park also has Ueno Zoo, famous for its pandas.  If you are into science-related things at all, the National Museum of Emerging Science in Odaiba (in Tokyo) is awesome. There's also the huge Gundam statue in Odaiba and the Rainbow Bridge.  When I was in Akihabara, I stumbled upon the Tokyo Anime Center, which had a free display of artwork for several currently-airing anime shows. It was really awesome, and there was also a gift shop. The building is UDX, the Anime Center is on the 4th floor, and it's not far from Akihabara Station at all.  In Asakusa, Sensoji Temple is a must of course, and Sumida Park is nearby.  The Ghibli Museum is really nice. It's in Mitaka, a little ways away from the center of Tokyo, so be sure to leave yourself enough time to get there. When you enter, they'll give you two little strips of paper with cells from random Ghibli movies (if it's anything like when I visited). If you want to buy Ghibli-related merchandise, My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service will have the most options by far. Heaven help you if your favorite Ghibli movie is something like Howl's Moving Castle though. I really had to search to find merchandise for it. Even Ghibli movies that are very well-known in the West, like Spirited Away, don't have as much merchandise in Japan as Totoro and Kiki do.  A couple more comments on the Ghibli Museum: don't forget about the roof outside - you can go up there and take pictures, and you'll find things from Castle in the Sky. Inside, you will be able to watch a 15-minute or so movie in the little auditorium that can only be seen at the museum. My friend and I watched one about an egg girl and a bread man, and it was quite good. The museum doesn't allow pictures except outside, which is really understandable because all the picture-taking would really slow things down. The gift shop can be more like a  mosh pit with everyone trying to buy things all at once, but it's definitely worth getting merchandise to commemorate your visit.  Hope you have fun!"

JapanTravel,37ieww,david_131,1 point,Thu May 28 05:32:56 2015 UTC,JR pass pays off when you make at least a Tokyo-Kyoto return trip + little side trips.  So you don't need one.
JapanTravel,37ieww,david_131,1 point,Wed May 27 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"JR Pass won't really pay off, so just pay for individual tickets. If you are on a budget consider flying with LCCs like Jetstar Japan or Peach from Osaka to Tokyo, or consider an overnight bus from Kyoto to Tokyo. I would just pay for the Nozomi Shinkansen. Have you booked your accommodation? I would spend more time in Kyoto to see more of Kyoto or do a day trip or two to see Nara or Himeji Castle, or even Osaka. Do Asakusa in the morning and Shinjuku in the afternoon. Have you already purchased your Ghibli Museum tickets? Look into the combined ticket for bus from Shinjuku + entry to Fuji Q. For Nikko pick one of the Tobu Passes. Note that if you want to leave on one of the early trains then buy this pass the day before if you can. Tourist Ticket Office opens too late for the first couple of trains. Allow some time to buy the pass as it can be time consuming. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_002.html Other options for Tokyo include Ueno/Ameyoko, Kappabashi, Odaiba, Tsukiji Fish Market."

JapanTravel,37g1x1,Gurtang,1 point,Wed May 27 11:44:13 2015 UTC,"I won't have time to get into the details of your trip, but I'm thinking with 6 weeks, depending on your budget and the pace you want to adopt, you may be able to see more diverse places. For instance, 2 weeks in Tokyo can be long (even including side trips), but of course it depends on your interests.  You could stop by Kanazawa and/or Takayama on your way down to Kansai.  Most tourists don't have the time go to 2 of the main islands : Shikoku and Kyushu. You could."
JapanTravel,37gh7r,Klaimzlgd,3,Wed May 27 13:26:55 2015 UTC,Not sure what your country of residence is but...  From US Customs and Border Patrol:  Can a minor under 18 years of age travel to another country without their parents?  Minors may be able to travel to another country without either one of their parents. They may however require a notarized written consent letter from both parents. Minors interested in traveling without their parents should contact the embassy  (US Embassy in Tokyo) to address admissibility questions. (Link)  Hotels will generally also require the person who books the room to be over 18 and have a major credit card. (May be different for hostels/room shares).  Contact your country's embassy in Japan for entry procedures/requirements for minors from your country. Being under 20 you may need a legal adult (age 20) to meet you at the airport in Japan to gain entry.

JapanTravel,37f3si,nomusicnolife,3,Thu May 28 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"It's so you don't buy something for someone in-country, thus letting them skip out on paying the sales tax. You're supposed to show the form and (unopened) item when you leave, but I hear you don't really have to. Personally I'd just keep the item unopened and show them the form, but I guess it's up to you."
JapanTravel,37f3si,amyranthlovely,-1,Wed May 27 05:19:39 2015 UTC,"Oh no, no no no. Don't throw it out. It's proof that it was under a certain amount, paid for, and the taxes were refunded. That way, when you go back to your home country, they won't assume anything like, oh, stolen or a higher priced item that you're trying to smuggle into the country. You can get in quite a bit of trouble for tossing paperwork given to you when visiting another country, up to and including having the item confiscated, and even being charged duty/taxes anyway. And that can be expensive if you catch the wrong guard on the wrong day.  TL;DR - If it's stapled to your passport, don't toss it and run the risk of having your item taken away at the border when you reenter your country. Wouldn't it suck to have spent the money, and not have something to show for it?"
JapanTravel,37dh7h,mrs1337,2,Tue May 26 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Sunday is a great day to visit Yoyogi Park and the stuff around it (Meiji Shrine / Takeshita Street / Harajuku / Omotesando (Hills/Prada) / etc)  Nijo Castle is combined with the Ninomaru Palace which is definitely worth visiting.  Also, why go back all the way to Narita to depart? Kansai International Airport is much more convenient if you're in Kyoto anyway, and will allow you another day seeing stuff in Tokyo or Kyoto.

Kansai International Airport is much more convenient if you're in Kyoto anyway, and will allow you another day seeing stuff in Tokyo or Kyoto.   We're using points to fly into Japan (shout out to /r/churning!), and it limited us a bit on flight options and airports.

When I was there (nov '13), i went to Yoyogi first thing in the morning but it was mostly empty, then after touring the other stuff nearby I went back to Yoyogi around noon and it was full of people.

Shibuya-Yoyogi-Harajuku is a solid half-day, and Asakusa is all the way across town (30-40min) and will take another three hours or so. Just focus on Sensouji, the street leading up to Sensouji (Nakamise-Dori).

JapanTravel,37cq9e,Kevins-honeybunch,3,Tue May 26 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"You have lots of good items on your lists. I have some suggestions for alternative works by the same creators.   Ogawa Yoko is one of my favorite authors, but The Housekeeper and the Professor is by far my least favorite of her works. It's a very pleasant, feel-good kind of book, but I like her more nuanced works better. I recommend the novella collection The Diving Pool instead.  For Soseki, I'd also switch Botchan for the more serious and slightly more renown work Kokoro, and with Abe Kobo switch The Woman in the Dunes for the less famous The Ark Sakura, which I've always thought was a little more interesting but very similar read.  In the movies, I'd switch Wolf Children with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time or Summer Wars. They're all the same director, but I think his first two are a lot stronger films than his more recent release, even though it's quite pleasant.  Also maybe look at Departures for the movie section.   But really, even if you don't change your list at all, you'll have lots of great reading and watching experiences."

JapanTravel,37cq9e,MissUteki,2,Tue May 26 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"Embracing Defeat is a fantastic and enjoyable read.  I'd also suggest The Inland Sea by Donald Richie.  Richie's writing is from the perspective of a foreigner living in Japan since the end of WW2.  Underground by Haruki Murakami is a very profound collection of interviews with survivors of the sarin gas terror attack in 1995. For fiction, Yukio Mishima's Sea of Fertility Tetralogy is great as is Ryu Murakami's Coin Locker Babies.  I'd add Audition to your list of films.  Good luck!"

Be warned that it will be crowded (but definitely worth it). I would try to do the autumn leaves watching outside of the week-ends :)  Red leaves in Miyajima are also awesome.  So if I were you I'd stay in Tokyo a few days first. I always recommend that, in order to get acclimated.   I don't know what you want to do in Nagoya but unless there's something specific I don't think it's really worth it in a short trip.  I'd do something like :    1 or 2 days in Tokyo Get to Osaka (around the 8th). Visit, spend the night. Around Nov 10th get to Hiroshima/Miyajima. There's also Himeji castle between Hiroshima and Kyoto. A few days in Kyoto. Back to Tokyo and side trips. Hakone is a good easy idea for an onsen ryokan stay, and can be done on the way back from Kyoto. I also recommend mt Fuji from Kawaguchiko if the weather is good. Nikko is a good side trip too.   Since time is essential in a 2 week trip, here are a few tips about Miyajima/Hiroshima. I basically consider that it can be done in 3 ways.   Very fast, one day trip : get there early in the morning and spend half a day in Hiroshima (just a quick walk in the peace memorial park, see the dome building, the flame, etc). The other half day in Miyajima. You can do either in the morning or the afternoon, so to enjoy it to the fullest, check the tide tables on the official site : get to Miyajima when the tide is hide. Medium paced : spend the night in Hiroshima in order to have more time in both spots. The most enjoyable but more expensive and time-consuming : sleep in Miyajima. That's especially nice if you want to see the floating torii by night, with the reflection in the water. Probably not worth it if you don't care about it, since lodging on Miyajima is usually more expensive and there are no activites after 6PM.   Hope I helped, just my 2 cents :)"
JapanTravel,37dwb9,Inkerlink,10,Tue May 26 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"What date/time do you arrive at Narita? By far the most common/easiest option is to just reserve your seat on the Narita Express when you arrive at Narita and exchange your voucher for the actual JR Pass. Due to flight delays/immigration/queues at the JR Ticket Office you probably have no idea which N'EX will be best for you anyway so you should just reserve when you are at the counter in Japan. The Narita Express is not normally very busy at all so you should have no trouble reserving a seat on the day even 15 minutes before the train departs.    I have never reserved online, always just do it at the counter when exchanging the voucher for the actual JR Pass."
JapanTravel,37dwb9,david_131,5,Wed May 27 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"This. You won't know which N'ex to take and there will be seats left, don't worry.

JapanTravel,37dwb9,zephyrnz,4,Tue May 26 23:57:32 2015 UTC,They have a number of cars on the train that are non reserved. I haven't had any issue getting on the train on the day without booking.
JapanTravel,37dwb9,xinganbaobei,1 point,Tue May 26 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"Just buy the NRT Express ticket when you arrive. They will ""reserve"" an assigned seat for you when you buy it for the next train. Hang on to the return voucher. On your return trip, you can go the day before to the JR ticket counter and trade in your return voucher for your actual ticket with seat assignment. Or just do it the day of.  JR Pass can only be used for non-reserved seating (just flash your pass to the guy manning the kiosk and jump on a non-reserved car), or you must go to the JR counter and get a reserved seat ticket. It's better to get a reserved seat ticket if it is a busy travel time."

There will be some trains/buses that are not covered by the JR Pass so usually I would suggest you buy a Suica (or Pasmo) in Tokyo when you arrive and use that for any non-JR transport. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html JR Pass info:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html http://japanrailpass.net/en/    If you fly into Tokyo and out of Osaka or vice versa then don't get a JR Pass.

It's similar to Couch Surfing though in that you can look at the feedback for your prospective hosts before hand. I picked my host specifically because they had such stellar feedback and was not disappointed. They were incredibly generous and included me in every aspect of their lives. Although, I don't speak much Japanese and communicating with the husband could be difficult at times, but it was equally rewarding and more than made up for the barrier.  HostX and Workaway.info are great as well for other types of jobs, but there aren't as many listings. There are lots of WWOOFing farms all over Japan. I recommend a work exchange because you really do have to communicate with them and get the satisfaction of a days work on something that actually helps improve their lives.  Granted, I did leave the farm I stayed at early. I realized I wanted to see more of the country and Japan and they were completely supportive of that. I can't speak for every host family, but mine was impeccable.  You're going to take a risk meting someone you don't get along with no matter what you use. If that worries you, use a service that has feedback available and choose a host you think looks promising. WWOOFing was great because I had some farms on backup in case mine didn't work out, but you have to assume anyone willing to let foreigners into their home is at least SOMEWHAT cool and open minded.

It's an American brand, but you can't buy the filtered version in America anymore (what).  They're classic and their tobacco is toasted and actually quite tasty.  Part of the enjoyment is nostalgia, because back in the day when they did sell filtered here it was what my good friend used to smoke, and we smoked it when we first went to Japan together after graduating high school.  Seven Star is a famous Japanese brand, but I've seen those available at Mitsuwas here before.  Golden Bat is a classic Japanese brand (I think the first Japanese cigarette?), but is pretty cheap and low quality, and non-filtered.  Go to a cigarette stand/convenience store to buy them, as you cannot purchase from a vending machine without a special card.  The cigarettes are number coded on the shelf behind the cashier so just say ""XX-ban o kudasai.""  If you don't know how to count in Japanese then now is the time to learn."

Are 15 days in Tokyo part of a longer trip or do you plan to spend all your time in Japan in Tokyo? With 15 days I would usually suggest splitting your time between Tokyo and Kyoto and then somewhere else. 15 days is too long for most people in Tokyo. Common option would be 7 days Tokyo, 7 days Kyoto, 1 day in between maybe in Hakone in a ryokan to see Mt Fuji. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5200.html From Kyoto common day trips to consider would be Himeji Castle, Nara for Todaiji and deer, and maybe Osaka:- http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1105.html    You could also consider including Hiroshima and/or Miyajima:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2160.html    If you can squeeze your ""away from Tokyo"" time into 7 days then a 7-day JR Pass will probably be useful. As a rule you do not need an active JR Pass while you are in Tokyo as individual tickets/daily tickets are cheaper.    Buy a Suica (or Pasmo) when you arrive.

Tokyo is cool, is big, yeah, what you want, but people in Osaka are WAY more friendly. And the food, o god, the food was the best. Try Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, and Kushiage... also... some local beef. I didn't like Kyoto too much to be honest. There are a LOT of temples there, very cool ones, but after certain point is more of the same. My favorite was Fushimi Inari."

After awhile it honestly feels the same. As i stay in Singapore and have went to a few temples locally and overseas, they were the more boring ones in japan. However i would still recommend going ther just do not stay there for too long.   Shrines however... I just cant get bored of them. They are all so beautiful.   Even tho mt hiei isn't very popular.

I would usually recommend Kyoto if you have any interest in the historical side of Japan. It is also a nice contrast to Tokyo. Osaka can be enjoyable but it is not as essential for a first or second time tourist. If you like food then Osaka is pretty enjoyable. Dotonbori at night, Amerikamura, Osaka Aquarium, etc. Plenty to see if you are interested. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2157.html Himeji Castle makes a nice half-day/day trip:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3501.html Nara makes a nice day trip too:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2165.html    If you prefer to just stay around Tokyo then Kamakura/Enoshima, Nikko, Hakone, Kawaguchiko, Nokogiriyama all make for interesting day trips."

Just bear in mind it is about $200 each way on the Shinkansen.   Costs a lot if you do it return as you double that (Or invest in a seven day JR pass for about $350)  Kyoto/Osaka have a few options for day trips like Nara or Kobe. Osaka and Kyoto themselves are also fairly distinct in what they offer so if you picked 'one' place this would work well.  But Tokyo. I could spend a year in Tokyo and not get bored. Day trips still from there to Hakone, Yokohama and Kamakura.   Seeing as you went to the effort to mention you aren't 'big' into shirnes, temples and museums my instinct is to suggest Tokyo.

Just make sure the flights aren't being pushed to a similar cost by the cost of the airport trains/transfers and luggage if you take luggage.

JapanTravel,37acl5,potterfanatic,5,Tue May 26 03:52:25 2015 UTC,I use the Japanese Rakuten site and though it asks for my name in hiragana when making a reservation it also accepts romaji.   It doesn't ask for an address though.   Do you already have a Rakuten account?   If not you might try creating an account on the English site and using it on the Japanese site.
JapanTravel,37acl5,MissUteki,2,Tue May 26 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about making an account on the English one and using that. Thanks, I'll definitely give that a go!"

JapanTravel,37a7bh,ukatama,1 point,Tue May 26 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"Edamame.　Yes, I know you can get it year-round through freezer technology, but the best time of the year for edamame is when they're in season, which is summer. If you can, try a varietal known as Cha-mame, which, again, is available in summer.   Ramune   Does your ramune have to come in a proper bottle? Ramune-flavored sodas are fairly easy to find; the bottles not so much."

JapanTravel,378914,dahliaPLS,3,Mon May 25 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for cheap yukata, maybe try one of the big UniQlos, like the one in Ginza, I know some years ago the one in Narita airport carried them year round.  Other good places to look are department stores like Aeon and Ito Yokado.  Also, younger leaning brands like Cecil McBee, tend to have cheaper ones too.  Depending on what you mean by ""a few days"", they may start popping up around the beginning of June, in various places."

The used clothing shop chain ""Chicago"" for example."

JapanTravel,378914,amyranthlovely,1 point,Thu May 28 09:45:08 2015 UTC,"They're all long but they're supposed to be pretty long because you pull it up with two white thin strips to the right length which is then folded over the white belts hiding them. Then the pretty wide belt (obi I believe) is used to cover the weird flap that happens when you pull the yukata up and then the obi is made into a bow.  Edit: And nope the price depends on cotton amount, whether it's for adults or little kids and just by store."
JapanTravel,378914,noumenonandon,2,Thu May 28 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"The yukata plus accessories are generally $100 in total, at least that's what I paid in total for mine. Keep in mind if you go to places like Isetan/Daimaru, you're looking at actual kimono, and they start at around $6000.00. Any gift shop should sell simple yukata, but according to my Japan book, Hayashi Kimono has a good selection of old and gently used kimono/yukata, AND it's close to Ginza. I can't vouch for it myself as I bought mine at a shop by Kiyomizu-dera in Kyoto, but the staff should be able to assist you."

JapanTravel,378914,its_real_I_swear,2,Mon May 25 19:49:09 2015 UTC,Any major department store should have a yukata section in the summer. Check the large ones in Ginza (Mitsukoshi and the like) for big displays of higher end yukata.
JapanTravel,378fih,choboy456,2,Mon May 25 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"I was not familiar with Kibune/Kurama. Thanks for that!   July 28 - Ginkakuji Temle -> Higashiyama -> Kiyomizudera    I really enjoy Kiyomizu in the early morning, before the crowds are there. The outer grounds of the temple are freely accessible, and the main hall opens from 6:30, so you could aim to get there around 6:15. Since you'll presumably still be jet-lagged it might fit nicely with your sense of time.   July 31 - Day trip to Arashiyama   Yes!! Good!! :D Look into bicycle rental if you're into that sort of thing.  If this were my itinerary I would be expecting to drop a few items on the list in favor of breaks or simply a slower pace. I guess if you never get tired and don't need a lot of sleep/food/pampering then you should be able to check off everything, but I would advise planning some more rest.  I found Akihabara a bit confusing/underwhelming, probably because I did not know what to look for. If you are interested in a bit of otaku atmosphere, you might also try Nakano Broadway. I found that much easier to just wander around in.  Lastly, your itinerary mainly lists areas. You could think about experiences as well - things like good/funny restaurants (do a search for 'tokyo themed restaurants' and you're bound to find something interesting), theater, music shows, or festivals.  Have fun! :D"
JapanTravel,378fih,ThisIsSoWrong,2,Mon May 25 19:53:39 2015 UTC,Good call on Kiyomizu I didn't even think of crowds and Nakano Broadway sounds pretty interesting so I might just do that instead. Thanks!

On 28th maybe walk down Pontocho in the evening after Kiyomizudera. Aug 2 is Sunday so maybe Meiji Jingu, Yoyogi Park then Harajuku. Tsukiji then Ginza then Akihabara may be a better sequence.

The car places we went to in Tokyo were Spoon/Type One, Nismo (Nissan) Headquarters, Bee Racing, Super Autobacs (brand new car parts), Up Garage (used car parts) and Toyota Megaweb. In Osaka, we went to Osaka JDM/Five Mart. It was really far from the train station though. More than a kilometer walk. But it was my favorite since I got to meet Kazuhiro and I was able to see the Civics he was working on which I am a big fan of.   Super Autobacs and Toyota Megaweb are both in Odaiba (where the Gundam statue is) Bee Racing and Up Garage are both in Machida (this is pretty far from central Tokyo, you have to take the bus in addition to the train plus there is A LOT of walking involved) Nismo is in Yokohama (also far from central Tokyo, you have to take a bus too after the train. No walking though, since when you get off the bus, you're already there.) Spoon is just a few train stops away from Shibuya but you'd have to walk quite far to get to the place.   You could also try going to Tsukuba Racing Circuit if time permits. I haven't been there but would definitely go when I go back."

Gorgeous, clean, and the private rooms had fresh tatami and it was amazing. Really nice people too.  2) There are a ton of things to see, and most of them are spaced around the outer borders of the city, so it can be hard to try and fit everything in. Japan-guide does a good job breaking it up into sections of the city, and if you rent a bike (recommended) it is an easy way to get around to everywhere - transit can take forever. My top choices are: Nijo castle, Kiyomizudera, Fushimi Inari, Kinkakuji (full of tourists but really gorgeous, go early), and the Iwatayama monkey park. Kyoto station is awesome too, and the Gion district & Nishiki market for food & shopping & just looking around.  3) Nara is totally worth it for a day trip, Nara park is gorgeous and there are cute deer everywhere that will eat out of your hands. Even if you are ""templed out,"" Todaiji temple in Nara park is worth a visit, it is huge and super awesome."

The rest really depends on where you plan to eat. Unless you plan on eating at any of the high-end in-demand places there are thousands of places in Japan to eat that don't require reservations.
JapanTravel,374wt8,david_131,3,Sun May 24 23:15:49 2015 UTC,You definately don't need reservations months in advance for Robot Restraunt. A few days in advance should be more than sufficient.  I didn't have any reservations when I went and was able to get in to the 4;00 show easily.

JapanTravel,3755ol,ramsesshaffy,1 point,Mon May 25 08:33:42 2015 UTC,"I stayed for 4 days in Kyoto and 7 days in Tokyo at airbnb accommodations and found it cheaper to hotel options by about 3000-4000Y a night. I was traveling in a group of 5 though, so airbnb would have been the more convenient option for us anyway.   Be warned that most Japanese apartments are tiny, especially the bathroom. Otherwise the places we stayed at are clean and comfortable. One of the perks is that most apartments came with a complimentary portable wifi, which helped us a lot and saved us the trouble/cost of hiring one ourselves."
JapanTravel,3755ol,aentee,1 point,Mon May 25 00:01:57 2015 UTC,... Are the toilets like... airplane toilet tiny?
JapanTravel,3755ol,sigint_bn,1 point,Mon May 25 08:42:23 2015 UTC,"Both the places I went to had the toilet in a separate, small room.  It basically fits just the toilet, and there's a sink over the toilet bowl.  So yeah, airplane toilet tiny. But I've seen similar sized toilet rooms in Western house as well."
JapanTravel,3755ol,aentee,1 point,Wed May 27 01:31:43 2015 UTC,"Did both (hotels and airbnb in both towns).  It really depends. In Tokyo Airbnb was a little cheaper, but I was looking for a specific area so it eliminated many options.  In Kyoto I found a big house for my family (we were 6), central situation, it was more expensive than a nice hotel (daiwa roynet) but more convenient for us.  So really it depends. You need to compare airbnb with sites like booking :) In my experience, good airbnb in these big and touristy cities are NOT as cheap as you'd hope."
JapanTravel,3755ol,Gurtang,1 point,Mon May 25 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing this. Definitely cheaper than a hotel. I'll be staying in an airbnb apartment in shinjuku for a month starting the 29th, I'll let you know how the owner is, etc if you'd like a recommendation."
JapanTravel,3755ol,illasya,1 point,Mon May 25 02:52:30 2015 UTC,Stayed at them in Tokyo; one in Shin-Okubo (close to Shinjuku) I couldn't recommend enough and a second one in Shibuya which was also pretty nice. They were both way nicer than the business hotels that were around the same price if not a little bit more expensive.  Extra plus is they both provided pocket wifi so only needed to rent it for times when not staying at the air bnb.  EDIT: If you'd like to know them more than happy to link.
JapanTravel,3755ol,sierra-juliet,1 point,Mon May 25 09:12:33 2015 UTC,Staying in an airbnb apartment currently in Kyoto in the middle of Gion. We have a group of five so this three bedroom was a steal for us. We also stayed in an apartment from airbnb in Osaka and will be in Tokyo later in our trip. I can send the listing that I'm staying at if you're interested.
JapanTravel,3755ol,saroka,1 point,Mon May 25 09:18:04 2015 UTC,"AirBNB was fine for 1 week in tokyo and 5 days in kyoto during cherry blossom season. Definitely cheaper than hotels. Rooms were clean, bathrooms tiny, but not airplane tiny."

Btw I'm traveling with my wife so it's also perfect for a couple.  Besides, it is true what other say, it's totally a different experience since you get to 'live' the day-to-day the Japanese way, I love that!  Hope this comment helps."

JapanTravel,372x99,amyranthlovely,3,Sun May 24 10:53:53 2015 UTC,"Yokohama and Kamakura are a day each, tops. And if you're willing to spend 10 days in Tokyo because of the ""modern"" side, I think you should also take a jaunt down to Osaka. It's more blue collar than Tokyo, the vibe is friendlier, and the city itself is very charming. Personal opinion, though.  (Not to mention the fact that quite a lot of the ""history"" that you'll see reference to in Tokyo has its seat in Kyoto.)  So, that being said, if you want to do 10 days in Tokyo, you can probably take another week and split it between Kyoto and Osaka. Staying in either city is fine because the train from Osaka to Kyoto, or vice versa, is an hour tops.   If I had to recommend only certain places in Kyoto for someone, then my choices would be (going from the farthest corner and back towards Kyoto Station) Arashiyama, Ryoan-Ji, Kinkaku-Ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Fushimi-Inari Shrine (easily half a day if you climb to the top of the mountain, and with the city views you should), and Sanjusangen-do. Fushimi Inari is also close to the sake brewing district, so if you made that area a day trip, you could climb the shrine and cool off with a nice sake later. :3  Osaka should be fairly easy for you to get around, and everyone has preferences, but you should actually check out Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, Osaka City Station shopping complex, Dotonbori, Namba, and the new Abeno Harukas building in that area. The rooftop view is supposed to be incredible. The top of the Floating Garden Observatory is good for that as well.   Don't forget to take some time to wander the side streets in all the cities you visit. That's where you'll find the real energy of the country and some hidden gems that sometimes even the locals don't know about."
JapanTravel,372x99,amyranthlovely,2,Sun May 24 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I like the idea of splitting one week in both Kyoto and Osaka. I definitely won't be bored with two cities to explore in one week. Thank you :)"

JapanTravel,372x99,Gurtang,2,Mon May 25 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"If you are not interested in traditional culture in Japan, i think it isn't worth to spend a half day to go to Kyoto. But if you can enjoy Tokyo, you can enjoy Osaka as well.  Anyway, you must see the Odaiba Gundam that is secret weapon of Japan instead of nuclear."
JapanTravel,372x99,Gurtang,2,Sun May 24 13:24:08 2015 UTC,You don't need 2 days in kamakura (or Yokohama imho).

JapanTravel,372x99,Moulinoski,1 point,Mon May 25 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah sorry :D  About Kyoto, it depends on your budget. Even if you're not into temples/shrines etc, if you have the money to pay for a shinkansen return trip (and maybe a few days in the area if you want to check out the more modern Osaka too), the most beautiful temples you will see would be in Kyoto, so it may be worth it.  If you want to save some money and don't care much about the old Japan, then Kamakura (and/or maybe Nikko ?) can be enough.  You should also try an onsen ryokan one night :)"
JapanTravel,372x99,david_131,2,Mon May 25 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"if you dont like history kyoto can be a bit of a bore. it is a nice place if you want quiet,  relaxing,  cafes. Osaka is an awesome city with a bit more modern vibrancy.   yokohama is a hard place to kill to days,  agree with others spend one day and move on. keep in mind travel marketing can really over hype a place. so things like yokohamas china town is really just a series of identical restaurants.."

JapanTravel,372ud3,Extremely_Agreeable,2,Sun May 24 10:02:55 2015 UTC,"What country are you from? If you really need internet access when you land then in some countries you can buy prepaid data SIMs for Japan before you arrive in Japan. Usually I recommend you rent a pocket wifi in Japan. If you rent a pocket wifi or a SIM card then you can often just get them delivered to your hotel so that they are there when you check in. If you really want to pick it up from Haneda instead of just waiting until you get to your hotel (or if you don't stay in a hotel), then some of the Pocket Wifi Rental companies will have 24 hour pickup at Haneda. For exmaple, check Global Advanced and the ""Premium Delivery"" option as mentioned on this page:- http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/pocketwifi.html"
JapanTravel,372ud3,david_131,2,Sun May 24 23:52:17 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! this pocket wifi thing is definitely better than my original plan of getting a couple of sim cards for our group

It was hard enough finding places that showed that, let alone an NRL game (it was a tournament Japan were competing in too!). Eventually we found a Hub and asked them to put it on, which they were very nice to agree to.  There are a couple of Irish bars, but they are hamstrung by what is on the pay-tv channels.

This failed miserably because most, if not all of them, require you to sign up for some kind of service or already have internet access to verify login info.  I broke down and borrowed my friend's phone for the entire trip. On the second trip I arranged for a pocket wifi.  I got access anywhere and everywhere (except for some parts of the subway), and quick UL/DL speeds too. I've never used the app but I'd be cautious, with all the talk on the website about needing a ""premium code"" and already finding out the hard way that Japan's free wifi isn't very free.

A translation app would have been very useful as well (the kind where we speak an English word and the app speaks its Japanese counterpart word). i'd read that many people in Tokyo speak English but we did not find this to be the case.  I did do additional research and planning each night using hotel wifi but it didn't help when we were out and about looking for someplace specific or trying to bridge the language barrier. Definitely regret not having made arrangements to get a local sim card or international plan from our home carrier for the two weeks we were there."
JapanTravel,3721dv,its_real_I_swear,-1,Sun May 24 07:11:30 2015 UTC,I usually advocate going without for a week and having an adventure. Use your hotel's Wi-Fi to keep in touch and plan

That said, it's seen as a more gourmet item than an everyday thing, so it's going to be really expensive."

However, going inside it was a bit of a let down. Huge queues going up to the top floor, where there's just a kind of buddhist shrine thing that didn't appeal much at all. The castle is basically empty inside.  In Osaka the sushi at Ichiba Zushi (food and setting) was amazing and cheap-ish, esp the fatty tuna at 900Y.  There's a garden near by you can have access to with a combined ticket, it was very nice.  Do check if a JR pass works out cheaper, it may not. Get a Japanese sim card, I got one with a 2GB data plan (from japan-rail-pass.com). Having access to google maps helped a hell of a lot."

JapanTravel,36wqsh,ogawaelena,2,Fri May 22 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Aw, ruined my fun so I will stalk and repost here!  Retranslation of the bad Japanese translation for the lolz  Back story: I was small as a child so a Japanese student existed (inanimately) in our family. Now the time is here for the place where (sic) I visit I acquire (/sic) Japan. When I will stay on the moon (sic) at (/sic) one of our antique students [note: the ""old"" used here is not the same as the ""old"" used in English] I have no need to be absent from things. I'm going, time is not set but it will be a certain amount of time and likely be next year. Don't worry about the distance, importance, or size of the places I visit, me. I want to see it: Noodle shops (i.e. places that sell just noodles), temples, castles, gardens, shopping malls, small local shops, shopping centers, pools, beaches, mountains, amusement parks, museums, festivals, and everything between them. If a ""someone please skilfully reference them"" way exists then tourists should look, is showing a list of all places possible? Also what is the best time this year to go? Thanks to you <3  You probably already knew this, but google translate doesn't do a great job making things understandable between these two languages. It's not nearly as good as Spanish and English, for example.  EDIT Ok I will try to actually be helpful :p.  I'm a big fan of Spicy ramen and gyokai tonkotsu.  If you are also I recommend these two places:  Karashibi Kikanbo (in Kanda, and now in Ikebukuro as well) and Tsubaki (used to be in Nishi-arai, but moved to Oji).  There are a buttload of museums in Tokyo so it depends on what you are interested in.  But let's get rid of the obligatory tourist spots -> Sensō-ji Temple and its shopping street (Asakusa), Tokyo Tower / Skytree, Fuji TV building, Shibuya scramble crossing, Tsukiji fish market, Gyoen park or Imperial garden, Odaida gundam statue, Akihabara (anywhere), Ueno park, Sunshine city in Ikebukuro.  Those are just off the top of my head.  However, my real advice would be go to a hot spring.  Stay over at a hot spring resort, if possible, especially if it is a cooler time of year.  YES YOU WILL BE NAKED OMFG GET OVER IT (ok, just needed to get that out of the way, unsure if this actually bothers you or not but it really shouldn't).  Hakone is the goto place near Tokyo...finding others is a rather difficult task (unless you are going for a day trip in which case I've compiled a mental list of places I've visited).    Hmmm looking at the other categories you have listed that I haven't addressed:  Castles -> Don't know any around Tokyo, really Pools -> Eh, not really worth it but they are around in various places Beaches -> None in Tokyo itself, really, except maybe Odaiba?  Better off going to Kamakura Mountains -> There are tons in the western part of Tokyo Metro.  Mt. Takao is popular.  And Mt. Fuji of course but you need to be in great physical shape to even attempt to climb it.  My wife did it and she says it was by far the most grueling experience of her life.  There is a saying that goes something like this ""A wise man will climb Mt. Fuji, A stupid man will climb Mt. Fuji twice"" Amusement Parks -> Fuji Q Festivals -> I'm not really an expert in this area"

A more common option if you want to share an onsen together is a ""private onsen"" or sometimes called a ""family onsen"". This is usually an onsen that you can reserve for a period of time (45 mins, an hour) and sometimes at additional charge so that you have exclusive use of that one onsen for that timeframe. There are also ""private onsen"" that are actually attached to, or in, your room, although there are significantly fewer ryokan that offer this option.    Some options for places for you to consider would be Hakone for your ""mountain"" ryokan. This is fairly standard/normal for tourists and makes a reasonable stop on the way from Tokyo. In clear weather there are nice views to Mt Fuji. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5200.html    Not sure what would be best for ""beach"" but maybe Shirahama might suit you? Easy enough to visit between your Kyoto and Osaka stay:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4958.html    If you wanted to head further into the mountains, like the central alps region (eg.

Not sure what booking sites you are using but for ryokan I usually use:- http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/index.htm http://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/ http://www.japanican.com/ http://travel.rakuten.co.jp/en/    The local districts sometimes have their own tourism websites which also have a list of smaller places. JNTO also have some reasonable lists for various areas.    Plenty of other options that may suit you too, a common list of onsen places:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2292_where.html"
JapanTravel,36tb6q,david_131,1 point,Fri May 22 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for all this info! I'm spoiled for options aha. The private onsen seems like it's probably a little steep for our budget, but the family option could be a thing depending on where we end up."
JapanTravel,36tb6q,oosuteraria-jin,2,Sun May 24 00:09:26 2015 UTC,A little north of Osaka is Arima onsen. I've never actually been. But it's an option you can look into.
JapanTravel,36tb6q,HeadBrainiac,2,Fri May 22 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"We stayed two weeks ago at a ryokan in Kyoto (in case you opt for a city stay) -- http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/ryokan-single/?ryokan=Nagomi+Ryokan+Yuu. It's 80 years old but had a modern bathroom.  We had an upstairs room with a sloped ceiling which made it a bit difficult as we had to hunch over to avoid bonking our heads. However, I would imagine you could request a room with an 8' ceiling when making your reservation.  PM me if you'd like additional information about our experience there. Enjoy your trip!"
JapanTravel,36tb6q,5555458544,2,Fri May 22 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"for Onsen and Beach, I'd suggest Kinosaki, and the neighbouring Takeno beach area?  Kinosaki is one of the most popular onsen resort towns for Japanese people, with people coming from all over Japan to visit the different baths. From what I remember, there's not a lot in the way of mixed/family bathing areas, though..  edit:: http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3526.html 2.5hr by train from Kyoto, 100% covered by JR pass.  as for the beach.. 竹野 (Takeno - do an image search) there's a beach a few minutes away by train, which has a nice view of the sea, and surrounded by a quaint little town. It's pretty out of the way, but a nice trip to be had?  Also: your piercing should be fine. Don't stress about it."

JapanTravel,36tfgu,david_131,4,Fri May 22 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"The Top Gear episode is from Season 11 Episode 4 for the ""Nissan GT-R vs Japanese Bullet Train"" race.    They travel from Hakui to Nokogiriyama. The train splits on the Keikyu line.    The episode is really good and we actually followed the path Richard Hammond and James May took from Tokyo to Nokogiriyama when we went. We caught the train from Shinjuku down to Kurihama, short bus ride from Kurihama station to the Ferry Terminal, then Tokyo Wan Ferry across Tokyo Bay to Kanaya and then you can walk to the ropeway which takes you up to Nokogiriyama. The whole temple complex is amazing with some great views across the bay, including Mt Fuji. Lots and lots of steps but well worth the effort to walk around! Was a really enjoyable daytrip and Nokogiriyama was pretty amazing. Probably helped that we went on a slightly rainy day during the week so we basically had the mountain to ourselves. The market at Kanaya was also pretty good and we stocked up on a lot of fresh fruit which was really well priced.  The multiple train coupling is fairly common in Japan. Even the Tohoku Shinkansen trains can be joined as they head north from Tokyo. For example the Yamabiko and Tsubasa are often joined and then split at Fukushima. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2018_tohoku.html  It happens in other countries too.

JapanTravel,36tfgu,i_cant_downvote,2,Thu May 21 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"In the episode they were on one train but when it arrived at a station the carriages split off into two separate trains and went on two separate lines. Though, this could of just been staged."
JapanTravel,36tfgu,ukatama,5,Thu May 21 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok, that's fairly common; it's for situations where the lines branch off to separate destinations and running extra trains doesn't make sense. The Narita Express, for example, runs from Narita Airport to Tokyo, then branches out to different destinations since there are different places people want to get to. There are only so many passengers coming in from Narita, so they split up the trains to head in different directions."
JapanTravel,36tfgu,BossMAN559,1 point,Fri May 22 00:03:57 2015 UTC,i have been on trains when they do this. i think it is where two lines merge into one and the platforms after they join are the longer ones.
JapanTravel,36tfgu,ukatama,5,Thu May 21 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"What do you mean it's not anounced?  On the Keikyu lines that do this and the Narita Express, the ones I've been on, it's announced pretty clearly several times as well as the info being shown on the info panels on the platform. With the Narita Express, it's even less of an issue since all seats are reserved and you purchase a seat going to your destination."
JapanTravel,36tfgu,HeadBrainiac,1 point,Fri May 22 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"We had reserved seats going from Kyoto to Osaka. We had trouble finding our carriage so just stayed in an empty one figuring we'd move if someone came along and we were in their seats. But when the conductor came through, he told our son (who lives there and speaks Japanese) that we had to move, and where to move to, because the train was going to split at the next station and we'd have been in the wrong half!  Edit: It might have been Nara. All those trains blended in, especially since we were blindly following our son like a dog follows its owners."
JapanTravel,36t65j,DramasticStar,3,Thu May 21 22:33:55 2015 UTC,I say spring to witness all the Sakura festivals and beauty of Japan. I personally am going in the fall because it's much cheaper for my flight.  I am very jealous of you. Enjoy!
JapanTravel,36t65j,omnigasm,3,Thu May 21 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"I vote spring only bc Sakura/hanami is one of those quintessential must-do in Japan things. You'd also be there during Golden Week, although whether that's good or bad could be debated."
JapanTravel,36t65j,lyra1227,1 point,Thu May 21 22:52:43 2015 UTC,Sakura blabla. Yeah it's beautiful. But so are autumn leaves and snow. It's really up to you.   You will have bad weather at one point of your semester either way (and beautiful too).

JapanTravel,36r219,JimmyTheChimp,4,Thu May 21 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"That is ~190,000 yen, or ~6300 yen per day. It's doable, but you would have a much better experience if you shortened your trip.     6300 yen per day means     Shelter     3000 yen per day average for a cheap hostel (2000 - 4000)     3300 yen per day left,     Food     Cheap fast food and convience store meals cost 300 - 600 yen per meal. Regular cheap meals cost 700 - 1000 yen per meal. If you plan on eating at nicer places or drinking alcohol, you are over budget.     Lets say you spend 1600 yen per day on meals, that includes a cheap convenience store lunch, one vending machine drink, and a decent but cheap dinner.     1700 yen per day left,     Transportation      You say you want to travel between multiple cities. Within a city, it costs 200 yen per train or bus ride, plus or minus 100 yen. To travel by shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka, it costs 15,000 yen. It's cheaper by air or by bus.      600 yen per day within each city     1100 yen per day left,     If you spend 100% of the left over money on travelling between cities, you will probably only be able to visit 3 or 4 places.   And, that is ignoring things like entrance fees to places or random supplies or souvineers.     If you cut your trip in half or by a third, your world will open up and you will be able to visit many more places, and live easier."
JapanTravel,36r219,otsukarekun,1 point,Thu May 21 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a detailed reply, essentially £1000 is around two weeks of travel? Would simply doubling my budget to £2000 give me a months worth of travel. Though I would definitely like to go for 1 month if I can only muster £1000 I guess 3 weeks could be something I could lean towards if it meant for a more enjoyable trip."
JapanTravel,36r219,otsukarekun,5,Thu May 21 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"Hostels are fine to stay in. Travel is the wild card. It all depends on what kind of trip you want.      If you want to stay in hostels, eat cheap food, and stick to one city, 6300 yen per day is plenty.     If you want to move around, see lots of places, either add in the price for a JR rail pass or add in extra for travel costs. 200 yen gets you across a city, 1000 yen gets you across a prefecture, 10,000 yen gets you across a region.     If you want to stay at somewhere with an experience like a ryokan, an onsen, or a temple for a night, you need to budget an extra 10,000 yen.     If you want to do things like go to museums, castles, or inside of temples, add in 300 to 1500 per place.      If you want to go to an izakaya, yakiniku, or nicer food place, add in 3000 yen per.     If you want to... blah... blah... add more. What are your interests and what do you plan on doing in Japan?      You probably won't need to double your budget, but cutting a week, or increasing your budget by 25% would add a lot to your experience."
JapanTravel,36r219,otsukarekun,1 point,Thu May 21 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding my interests and reasons, food and scenery i.e. hiking (cities and rural) are my main interests. Specific landmarks, museums etc. would probably go on a place by place can I afford this basis. The main places I guess I would pay for would be actual experiences e.g. Onsen.  In terms location seeing a Tokyo is a must for me as such I would like to base my self there as a central location, however shrewdster below mentions the Kansai prefecture. Should Tokyo just be seen as a place to spend a bit of time as there are better areas for travelling. Again, as money is dictating the trip I would prefer to stay in one prefecture avoiding expensive travel. However if I take your budget advice do I need to stay in one prefecture or is cross country travel feasible?  Assuming I do stay for a month you would say 240,000 yen would be a good minimum having maybe 290,000 available to account for random supplies, emergencies etc. Or if money is an issue staying for 3 weeks instead."
JapanTravel,36r219,shrewdster,2,Thu May 21 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"If you don't get a JR Rail Pass, you can calculate the prices of train tickets by using google maps in transit mode or http://www.hyperdia.com/en/  (Personally, google maps is easier to use and more useful, but hyperdia has more accurate prices. I would look up the route you want to go on google maps, then check it again on hyperdia).      3000 x 30 : hostels 5000 x 1 : extra for onsen stay (or 1000 for just a visit without staying) 2000 x 30 : regular meals, snacks, drinks 1000 x 10 : extra for better meals and local specialties 600 x 30 : inner city travelling 1000 x 5 x 2 : close day trips 3000 x 3 x 2 : far day trips, or overnight trips 4000 : roundtrip for Narita -> Tokyo ->Narita on the N'EX 14000 x 2 : Tokyo -> Kansai -> Tokyo (shinkansen, subtract accordingly for bus or airplane) 1000 x 10 : entrance fees 1000 x 30 : pocket wifi =283,000 minimum +souvenirs +living supplies +extra money that somehow disappears +emergency money -cost cutting like overnight buses or convenience store meals     This should give you a rough idea, you can adjust the numbers depending on your actual plan."
JapanTravel,36r219,Ivytiu,2,Fri May 22 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget you need to include admission costs, living supply expenses, etc all the things most people forget to account for.  You could take an overnight bus from city to city, it would set you back around 8,000¥ from Tokyo to Osaka. Some connections offer an overnight train ride, includes a bed.  If you just stay in the one area for the month, then it's definitely doable. If you stay in the Kansai area, you can visit Nara, Kyoto, Himeji, Osaka, Kobe and one or two day side trip to Hiroshima."

Also, there are cool shrines, temples, and castles in Kyoto that you could see and save yourself a day trip to Himeji if you want to cut down on travel, too.  Also, if you arrive in Osaka why not just start your trip down there instead up going up to Tokyo?"
JapanTravel,36soqa,santacruzmtb,1 point,Thu May 21 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people have to immediately leave the city they fly into.   You may have planned too much already to be able (and willing) to change it now, but I always recommend staying a few days in the same city first.   When in Tokyo, check the weather to know when to go to kawaguchiko (fuji). You can easily book a cheap and cancellable bus from shinjuku by googling ""shinjuku kawaguchiko bus"".   I'd consider more than one day in kyoto (I'd cut one in osaka). And a full day for Nara (except if you get up early and are really fast).   Also I hope your Hiroshima day includes miyajima !

Great site trips too (nikko, kamakura, and of course mt Fuji at kawaguchiko).   I've never been to hokkaido sadly. But the rest seems perfectly doable. Doesn't even seem that fast-paced to me.  Have you already checked if you'll use à JR pass ? Unless money isn't an issue at all you need to really plan and calculate, because trains are really expensive in japan."

They last for fifteen days. Although a day at a regular Sumo tournament starts in the morning for the junior divisions most people only arrive in the afternoon to watch the top two divisions. In general I would recommend arriving around 1pm, or maybe as late as 2:30pm if you prefer. Then you can watch the top two divisions. Sumo finishes at 6pm.    There are special one day events outside the regular tournaments that vary from year to year. The Summer Tour information was recently released:- http://www.sumo.or.jp/en/jungyo/schedule     There's a Japanology episode on Sumo which may be worth searching for."

JapanTravel,36pwhf,Hoonage,1 point,Thu May 21 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"I can answer the first part of your question: Hikari trains do run on the Tokaido line (not as frequently as Nozomi trains, but still very frequent from my point of view), so there are no issues with the JR pass.  On reservations: you can only make them once you're in Japan, from a month prior to your wanted date. I don't know if you have already rough estimate of the time you'd be traveling, but I was able to get reservations even during crowded periods like the Obon using some careful planning.  Lastly: use hyperdia.com to plan your itinerary, as they include the train fares. A JR pass may or may not be convenient depending on what you do: sum up the cost of the various tickets you'd be using and see if it's at least equal or higher than the cost of the pass, otherwise it's not worth it (although yes, it's very convenient)."

There are a few passes which you can buy in Japan which may save you some money, and there are alternatives to Shinkansen sometimes, and sometimes Shinkansen package deals which may suit. Depends a lot on your exact itinerary so if you can post it day by day it is easier to provide advice/alternatives.     Although technically you need to buy it outside Japan, if you really need a JR Pass contact one of the online specialists and they may be able express ship/FedEx it to one of your hotels. Pretty sure this site has been mentioned before in this sort of situation, you may need to explain the urgency to them.

Do you realise that it is relatively expensive to go to Kyoto for the day? http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2363.html    Yes, it is possible to see a fair amount in Kyoto in one day, especially during June which is not peak season. One of the suggested itineraries here may suit you:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3950.html    If you just want to experience some temples/shrines in Japan you may prefer to consider a day trip from Tokyo to either Kamakura or Nikko instead:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2166.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3800.html    If you do plan on taking the Shinkansen to Kyoto and back then I would probably consider buying a 7-day JR Pass. That way if you wanted to go to Kyoto again on another spare day you could, or you could use it for some of your other Tokyo transport, or day trips from Tokyo."
JapanTravel,36nt84,david_131,2,Wed May 20 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on your plans. But you certainly can't explore all of it in a single day."

JapanTravel,36nt84,itsavgbltpta,2,Wed May 20 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"I will chime in and say that we tried to do some sightseeing in Kyoto in a day, and unfortunately due to the MASSIVE amounts of visitors to the city it was difficult to get from one place to another in an expedient manner. Sadly we spent more time in line for a bus or on a bus than at the sites we wished to visit.   In fact, by the time we had made it to one of the sites, it was already closed for the evening (around 5PM), which we did not expect - seemed like an extremely early closing time!  I think it's very doable if you choose a small section to explore or hit several sites all in the same area of the city - but seeing ALL of it is definitely going to be a challenge."
JapanTravel,36nt84,Talima,2,Wed May 20 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"What date(s) were you there? I always suggest people avoid the buses during peak seasons especially if you don't use them from a terminal like Kyoto Station. Even from there you will often encounter long queues during cherry blossoms or autumn colours.    I usually find it quicker/easier to use the subways and either walking or very short taxi hops.    As mentioned, a bicycle can be a reasonable option as long as you are aware of parking.    Outside peak seasons (like June) the buses can be ok but can still be a little time-consuming."

Of course, if you feel like walking don't hesitate to walk but realistically even if you use trains from one area to another you will still be doing a huge amount of walking while sightseeing in Japan. Probably not unusual to do 10-20km (6-12 miles) per day for a lot of tourists.    Are your three weeks just as a tourist in Tokyo?

Even if you go as far as hiroshima, you can fit it in a 7 day pass if you want to save money. It means you may not stay in Kyoto as much as is usually recommended, but hey, you won't be able to do everything erevywhere anyway. You can make up for it with side trips from Tokyo outside of the pass.   This is how I see it. Be aware it is fast paced, but to get most of japan in 14 days that's what you need.  You can of course arrange the days as you want.    Day 1 of the pass : shinkansen early for Kyoto. Explore an area.  Day 2 : explore more.  Day 3 : day trip to Hiroshima and Miyajima.  Day 4 : nara Day 5 : osaka Day 6 : depends on your interests : more kyoto or Osaka, himeji castle...  Day 7 : back to Tokyo.    For the 7 days in Tokyo you can do side trips without the JR pass.

The JR pass means you walk straight into the station without having to buy tickets or figuring out costs. It also gets you reserved seats on the shikansen for no cost. You can randomly wander the JR lines without having to worry if it is worth the price to stop at a station.      Without looking up prices, it looks like a 7 day pass starting the 29th would save you more.     And to answer your question, no the JR pass aren't everywhere. JR lines are the major lines, the shinkansen lines, and the lines that go between cities. Streetcars, buses, and private subway lines, are not covered. In Tokyo and Osaka, the JR lines are the primary backbone lines, but all of the little lines that make up the web are private lines. In places like Kyoto, you should purchase a day bus pass as the bus is much more convenient."
JapanTravel,36lds4,otsukarekun,1 point,Wed May 20 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help.

JapanTravel,36lds4,Gurtang,2,Wed May 20 07:02:57 2015 UTC,"It depends. You can travel around most of the city, since most things are at the major stops on the Yamanote Line (JR). But, there are places you might need private lines to visit, like Odaiba, Asakusa, the Skytree, or whatever. Even then, nothing is really more than a few km from a JR station if you don't mind walking. In general though, the JR pass is enough to get you around Tokyo."

JapanTravel,36lds4,Gurtang,2,Wed May 20 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"The JR pass is for inter-city travel. Inside cities, it can be used on some lines but that's not the main use.   My usual advice (haven't read your itinerary accurately to check if it's doable) : stay in Tokyo area, without the pass, for a few days at the start and end of your trip. In the middle, use a 7-day pass to go to kansai.   If you want to travel further and longer, a 14 day pass can be worth it. Just always have Tokyo at both ends so your pass covers the return trip without wasting too many days not using it."
JapanTravel,36lds4,MissUteki,1 point,Wed May 20 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"I Have a question about this as well. I am contemplating getting the 7 or 14 day pass. Outline of Itinerary:  June 5,6, Osaka  June  7, 8, 9 Day Trips (Not planned you either Hiroshima, Nara etc)  June 10, 11 Kyoto  Jun 12-16 Tokyo  My question is should I get the 1 week pass Starting June 6 or 7 and So i could get to tokyo with the JR pass - Or just get a JR pass the whole time? I am wondering if Osaka and Tokyo have good local train stations for us to get around and if it is more convenient then using the JR within a city and not intercity.  I am not sure if i make sense if you need clarification please ask what you need."
JapanTravel,36lds4,MissUteki,1 point,Thu May 21 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"7 day jr pass pays off with a return trip tokyo/kansai and à few side trips. It seems you're not flying out of the city you're flying into, so no return trip. So unless you do a lot of travelling via shinkansen within your stay in kansai (check if you want to do hiroshima and the cost of it on hyperdia.com), a  jr pass probably isn't worth it.   I emphasize that it will depend on your side trips, you need to plan and calculate. For instance a return trip in local train  between kyoto and nara is nothing (about 1500 yens). Same for osaka/kyoto. But hiroshima would be more costly since it would be via shinkansen. Other example, Himeji castle can be done in local train, but is also on a shinkansen so you could include it on a jr pass trip."
JapanTravel,36lds4,Tw1987,2,Thu May 21 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, if you haven't booked your air travel, you should look into flying an open jaw itinerary in to Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) and out from Kansai Intl (KIX).   If you can swing that, then you would save money by not getting the railpass.  With your current itinerary, you should get the 7 day railpass activated for use from the 27th.   The railpass is only advantageous when used for long distance travel, so for travel within Tokyo you should pay as you go, which will give you the flexibility to use either JR or the subway."

JapanTravel,36lds4,Tw1987,1 point,Wed May 20 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"On that note, I had a question about the different lines. I understand they're owned by different train companies?  But do all the train stations connect to one another?"
JapanTravel,36lds4,MissUteki,2,Thu May 21 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Sort of?   Some stations have different lines on different levels, at some points, the train and set of tracks you are on just become another line.  Sometimes you'll have a station for one train line very close to another train line 100-200 meters or so, they'll have a tunnel connecting the two stations.  Occasionally, we had to go up to the street level, cross the street and go down to a different station, but this was probably the least common occurrence.  If you're using some sort of subway card (Suica, Pasmo, etc) you don't really have to pay that much attention. I feel that's even more true if you have a smartphone and plan on getting a sim card and/or pocket wifi device.  I just used Google Maps to get around Tokyo the entire time I was there, it would tell me what train to get on when, where to get off/transfer/etc, and it didn't really steer me wrong."
JapanTravel,36lds4,Tw1987,1 point,Thu May 21 12:26:35 2015 UTC,"You're going to need to reserve your shinkansen seats the minute you enter the country, so you either need to commit to cash or the 14 day pass. Usually the pass is nowhere near worth it if you're only making one bullet train trip.   I think your prices are heavily inflated by taking the bullet train between osaka and kyoto (and other places? you should only be taking it part of the way to hakone, hakone to osaka and osaka to tokyo). The regular train is only ten minutes longer but costs like 30 or 40 dollars less.   Normally I would recommend you get a seven day pass, but then you won't be able to reserve your tickets."

If not, get the JR West Kansai - Hiroshima Pass to cover your travel in Kansai and Hiroshima and pay as you go for the rest of your trip.   I don't think the 14 pass will be worth it unless you add Nikko or other destinations."
JapanTravel,36lnjd,Japantravelling01,8,Wed May 20 08:25:22 2015 UTC,"It's just natto, not ""Natto meal"". Also, there isn't anything nontraditional about the natto sold in packages, that's how it's packaged for individual servings. Most restaurants, unless they make their own, would simply be buying the same stuff but packaged in bulk.  Having said that, I know the chain Ootoya sells those slime bowls of natto, okra, and nagaimo with a raw egg on top (look at the item called 大戸屋風ばくだん丼)."
JapanTravel,36lnjd,PlatinumMinatour,5,Wed May 20 08:52:30 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? A set menu with rice, miso soup and natto? Just go to a Yoshinoya in the morning, one of their breakfast sets is something like that.  Edit: I should add tht the natto may be served in a pack like you describe."
JapanTravel,36lnjd,ukatama,2,Wed May 20 08:48:35 2015 UTC,"Natto is natto. Family Mart and other convenience stores sell natto-maki. Spend ¥120 on it, see if you like it. People don't order JUST natto at restaurants. It usually comes as a side sometimes. Some wafu-spaghetti places have Natto spaghetti, which is good. Try Goemon."

JapanTravel,36lnjd,speaks_in_redundancy,0,Wed May 20 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to try natto, your best bet on a first foray would be going to a kaitenzushi place or something similar, and asking for nattomaki.  I guess that depends on if you're an ""I eat fish"" vegetarian or not, because if you don't like it, you'll be sitting in a restaurant with nothing else you can eat, other than maybe a tamago nigiri."

JapanTravel,36jdqx,i_cant_downvote,5,Wed May 20 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"Haha funny story...  A friend's boss had an izakaya and would invite us over every summer to have a meal there. It was a group of about 6 non-JP and about 10 JP people.  The first time, the chicken was placed in front of us as part of the set menu, and I said ""wait a minute, this is raw chicken. We can't eat this!"" and he explained that the chicken had been killed in the past hour and if I ate it with the ginger then it'd be OK in my stomach. So we all ate it. All the non-JP ended up in hospital but the JP folk didn't.   A year later, we were at the same place, with the same people and the chicken came out again. I remembered how the Japanese had been fine, so figured you just have to have a stomach that can handle it. Thinking that my stomach was ready, I ate it again.  I woke up having collapsed on my kitchen floor at 3am with my cat licking my face, and dragged my sorry bum to the hospital again.   TL;DR: I am an idiot."

JapanTravel,36j16l,Theria,2,Tue May 19 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"1) We were considering traveling around the surroundings of the cities I mentioned before, but have not really found any significant places we would like to visit outside of the cities themselves. If you have any suggestions on this matter, we would appreciate it. Do you know of any attractions worth the trip or any ‘hidden’ gems?   With one month, I would really, really suggest Hiroshima and Miyajima Island. Two weeks in Tokyo is a lot of time and Tokyo being so big it's a long trip to get 'out of tokyo' to the nearby towns. Miyajima Island is accessed by ferry from Hiroshima and is famous for grilled eel and some amazing walking tracks with deer all over the place, including the shops by the ocean.    2.2) We want to have unlimited access in Tokyo, no limits – is this even possible. We guess our best option here is the Suica, Pasmo or the Tokyo Free Pass, do you agree?   Suica is great as it's accepted in convenience stores and vending machines so handy without carrying around change all the time or fiddling with yen.    2.3) In Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, we plan on using the local buses and trains, which should be the most convenient way. One of us really doesn’t like to ride the bike well, so she would like to avoid using it. Will we survive without bikes?   Any transport is fine and yeah, buses rule these cities.   To help if you are using lots of local transport, google maps provided direction in your language including public transport in many areas of Japan. Look for a wireless pocket modem and book one for your trip. ABout $8 per day for unlimited high speed internet and as it's wireless it supports mulitple devices for you all to hook up your phones/tablets w/e. These will make public transport a breeze.    2.4) Apart from those buses, trains, and all the Tokyo routes, we plan on using a normal train from Kyoto to Tokyo and a Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka (just once for the experience, because it's really expensive). Do you have any better suggestions?   If you don't get any passes, a local Australian airline has expanded into Asia called Jetstar. About 8000 yen, plus any luggage so depending on your train fares and all that, can be a good alternative in some circumstances.    3) As we are travelling in the very hot and humid months of July and August, we are considering making a trip to a nice beach. Do you have any suggestions or are the beaches near the mentioned cities not worth the trip?   Onsen and Ofuro (Hot Springs and Bath houses) are a boon in the hot weather and are everywhere. They are gender seperated and usually no swimsuits. If you have any tattoos though you will be asked to leave most places. This goes for water slide theme parks as well so check any of these places first.   As for actual beaches, I know Okinawa is famous for it's beaches and resorts, but it is quite far out. I bet there are places near Tokyo too. As an Aussie living near the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coasts never looked into beaches in Japan :p   4) Is it a good idea to try out the capsule hotels for one night? All 4 of us will have luggage (wheel suitcases) that weigh around 20 kg/44 lbs with us. Is there a good and practical storing option for such luggage in those hotels? Do you have a suggestion for any specific capsule hotel?   These can be fun for the experience and my first night ever in Japan was a capsule hotel. However for storing stuff try to have a day trip bag with what you need for one night and drop your large suitcases in a locker at the train station/metro. The reason being there's no where to keep your bags after check out in many so you have to find lockers anyway and if you ditch the large suitcases before hand, the lockers are for 24 hours so you can just go back before the check in time or when you leave for your next stop. These lockers are also quire large and secure.   Much easier.  You'll have an amazing trip, I am a little jealous ^"

If you don't mind me asking, how many times have you been to Japan and how long did you stay there? Do you regret (not) seeing/experiencing something?     I have some more questions for you. I hope I'm not asking for too much:    We're considering going to Disney Sea or Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park. Did you visit any of these? Any suggestions? Have to been to Hitachi Seaside Park?   If yes, do you know if it's worth visiting in the summer?"
JapanTravel,36j16l,Vagabond_Sam,1 point,Wed May 20 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"but it just seems so far away from everything else that we thought it wasn't worth the time and money it will cost us to go there and back.   On the Shinkansen, the time really shouldn't be much of an issue. Maybe the cost depending on your budget will. For a full month your itinerary isn;t nearly as hectic as many people's who try to fit in the same amount to a 14 day trip so time wise I'd heavily consider it. Remember, the Shinkansen trains are lush even in economy class and you can grab a tasty bento to eat during the trip. They also have lots of room and nioce big windows to view the scenery so, to a certain extent it's not wasted travel time.  Hiroshima and Miyajima themselves are highlights from my time in Japan and sadly I only had half a day in Miyajima so I will be heading back there. Hiroshima has great Okonomiyaki and a day exploring the castle and peace memorial park is something you can;t find anywhere else. Miyajima was spared the devestation of the bomb so it's still very traditional and very beautiful.   I justified the cost as I planned a trip from Tokyo with a seven day pass and just made sure I was back in Osaka by the time it expired as I tend to fly in/out different cities to avoid back tracking where possible.    If you don't mind me asking, how many times have you been to Japan and how long did you stay there? Do you regret (not) seeing/experiencing something?   Six times since 2007 with time spent each time between a week and two weeks. There are many things I have yet to see but 'regret' is a little different for me as I can fly there return, for about AU$600 so it's easy for me to just go next time. As you can tell I try to go once a year. Most of my 'regrets' are missing festivals and particular special events. Things like the Ice sculptures in Sapporo in Feburary and the Fire festival in Nozawa Onsen. I also need to see more cherry blossoms as I only saw the last week of them in Sapporo last year and want to go view them in Kyoto one year.    We're considering going to Disney Sea or Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park. Did you visit any of these? Any suggestions? Have to been to Hitachi Seaside Park?   I've done Disneyland and SEA. If you have a Disneyland close, o rhave been before, DisneySEA is really really fun. The park is more 'mature' in theme (Relatively speaking, it's still disneyland) well reccomended.   Haven't been to Fuji-Q or Hitachi Seaside Park though.   I can recommend http://www.seaparadise.co.jp/english/ in Yokohama. An easy trip from Tokyo for a day and Yokohama is worth a visit too. They have a pretty good show with dolphins and all that and the various aquariums are pretty cool, including sunfish, dolphins and all that. Of note they have an area for hand fishing where they will then cook what you catch (Costs extra as you might expect).  Also, Osaka Aquarium is, so far, the most amazing aquarium I've been to with the worlds second largest free standing tank with giant manta rays and whale sharks. The aquarium wraps around the tank so on one side you have these enormous creatures while the other has the various other creatures (Spidercrabs from Japan's deepest oceans even ^ ^ )  Summertime is a great time to visit these places as they often have promotions on and there are lots of people travelling around domestically for days at the themeparks and natural attractions. I think living in such big a metropolis gives a big boon to visiting some of these reminders of whats outside for the residents so things will be fairly lively."
JapanTravel,36j16l,shrewdster,2,Wed May 20 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"One week in Kyoto, 2 weeks in Tokyo and one week in Osaka and Nara combined. If you think we are spending too much/too little time in any of these places, we would appreciate your input. Our budget is low, but that doesn’t mean we want to pass on stuff like Robot Restaurant or Onsen and Ryokan for a day or two.   I think a week in Kyoto would be overkill. You would be able to see all the major attractions and temples within 2-3 days, depending on how fast you and your friends are. If you're a bit more relaxed and slower, then 3-5 days would suffice. Ryokan is usually in the price range of 30,000¥+. You may be able to find some cheaper ones but I can't say the experience will be as good.  As for Osaka and Nara, you can make a half day side trip to Nara from Osaka.  Two weeks Tokyo is plenty, what exactly do you plan on seeing around here? You haven't given any specifics as to what exactly what you want to do and you stated you're a on low budget. There's plenty of shopping to do in Tokyo, it's just like any other major city.   1) We were considering traveling around the surroundings of the cities I mentioned before, but have not really found any significant places we would like to visit outside of the cities themselves. If you have any suggestions on this matter, we would appreciate it. Do you know of any attractions worth the trip or any ‘hidden’ gems?   There are plenty around, but what exactly are your interests?   2.1) Is it possible to buy several Kansai Thru Passes for one person, for example so each of us could buy 2 passes?  2.2) We want to have unlimited access in Tokyo, no limits – is this even possible. We guess our best option here is the Suica, Pasmo or the Tokyo Free Pass, do you agree?   Kansai Thru Pass is 4,000¥ for two days, I doubt you would be taking that many trains/buses for a day. In Osaka, you can a single day pass for the subway which is 600-900¥, unlimited subway rides, the price is dependent on the day. For the Tokyo Free Pass, I doubt you would be spending 1,600¥ on trains on a day unless you are travelling a lot. Just calculate where you are going the day before and decide.  The Suica and Pasmo cards are not unlimited travel, you will need to top the balance up yourself. They're just a prepaid travel card.   2.3) In Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, we plan on using the local buses and trains, which should be the most convenient way. One of us really doesn’t like to ride the bike well, so she would like to avoid using it. Will we survive without bikes?   I live in Osaka and I came here for holidays a couple of times before. There would be no need for a bike. You can get around with using only the trains, subways and buses.   2.4) Apart from those buses, trains, and all the Tokyo routes, we plan on using a normal train from Kyoto to Tokyo and a Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka (just once for the experience, because it's really expensive). Do you have any better suggestions?   Really? You'll be spending about 8,500¥, making 9 transfers which total 5 ~ 6 hours travel time. The Shinkansen would get you there in 2.5 hours and costs around 13,000¥. I mean go for gold, if you enjoy transferring on all the local train. Perhaps, you could find a cheaper Ryokan and use the money towards the Shinkansen. I would not enjoy lugging my luggage from train to train and spending an extra 2.5 hours. Perhaps an overnight bus? It's slightly cheaper, I think around 7,500¥ and you won't need to do all the latter. Plus, you can just sleep the night and you'll be in Tokyo when you wake up!   3) As we are travelling in the very hot and humid months of July and August, we are considering making a trip to a nice beach. Do you have any suggestions or are the beaches near the mentioned cities not worth the trip?   No place better than Okinawa. You'll need to fly there, it's pretty cheaper with the budget airlines - Peach Air and Vanilla Air.  4) Is it a good idea to try out the capsule hotels for one night? All 4 of us will have luggage (wheel suitcases) that weigh around 20 kg/44 lbs with us. Is there a good and practical storing option for such luggage in those hotels? Do you have a suggestion for any specific capsule hotel?  Never stayed in one before so I can't comment.  Have fun on your journey!"
JapanTravel,36j16l,shrewdster,1 point,Wed May 20 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"Hi, shrewdster! Thank you for your answers, all of us really appreciate them.  Let me clarify a few things that I left out in the main post. I didn't realize how important they were when I was writing it.     We want to take it somewhat more easy during this trip. Sure, we want to see a lot of stuff but that doesn't necessarily mean we want to do everything as fast-paced as possible. We're also looking forward to the days when we'll just walk around the cities with no goal at all, maybe even get lost a bit and just try to observe everything.      Naturally, as a group of four, our interests vary: Two of us like anime and manga; the other two don't know anything about it and they want to climb Mt. Fuji, while the first pair don't even want to consider hiking. It's going to be tough at times, but we'll compromise and there are still a lot of things we have in common. :)   We want to check out both the traditional and modern aspect of Japan - check out the night-life, karaoke, museums, try out all sorts of food, relax in a onsen, go to an ofuro, visit temples, and experience a night and dinner at a ryokan. We want to see the nature, meet new people, get to know the Japanese culture that seems so crazy on the outside at times, yet so conservative in many points. Hell, we would even love to check out a good zoo if there is one there.     Ok, I'm going to get to your answers now. :)      I think a week in Kyoto would be overkill. You would be able to see all the major attractions and temples within 2-3 days, depending on how fast you and your friends are. If you're a bit more relaxed and slower, then 3-5 days would suffice. Ryokan is usually in the price range of 30,000¥+. You may be able to find some cheaper ones but I can't say the experience will be as good. Actually, we arrive in Kyoto during the Gion Matsuri, so we'll spend at least 2 days at the festival. We also think we will still be jet-lagged from the flight, so we might lose a day or two just from that. Do you still think a week is too much. The thing is, our AirBnb accommodation for Kyoto is already booked.  As for Osaka and Nara, you can make a half day side trip to Nara from Osaka.   So you think it's not worth actually staying at a place in Nara? Is half a day really enough? Should we just book something in Osaka instead? We are planning on being in this area for the last week of our stay. Would you say a week is too much in this case as well?      There are plenty around, but what exactly are your interests?   Well, as I mentioned above. We're not really picky, we want to experience as much of Japan as possible. We actually aren't really sure what exactly we are looking for. Could you suggest something YOU really liked there? I'll ask you the same questions as Vagabond_Sam: While you were in Japan, was there anything you regret not seeing? And was there anything you saw that you thought was actually a waste of your time?      The Suica and Pasmo cards are not unlimited travel, you will need to top the balance up yourself. They're just a prepaid travel card.   Yeah, I actually know that, I just didn't phrase that question right at all. Let me try again: We were looking at the best options for travelling around Tokyo. Ideally, that would be an unlimited travel pass. We know that the JR-Pass is mostly only good for 1 line, so that's probably not a good idea. What about the Tokyo Free Pass? Is it worth its money or is it a better idea to just get a Suica and pay for every single ride we take.      Btw, I have an important question regarding the Suica/Pasmo: Let's say we go on a trip from X through Y to Z. With either of these cards, when you pay for a train from** X to Z, does it include **changing trains at Y or do they charge you for each individual train you take? Or am I completely wrong here? :D      Really? You'll be spending about 8,500¥, making 9 transfers which total 5 ~ 6 hours travel time. The Shinkansen would get you there in 2.5 hours and costs around 13,000¥.    Wow, this is really helpful: we didn't know we would have to make 9 transfers. We will probably reconsider taking the bullet train for both ways. Do round-trip tickets for Shinkansen exist? Do you suggest reserving seats beforehand? Keep in mind, we probably won't go for a JR-Pass.      No place better than Okinawa. You'll need to fly there, it's pretty cheaper with the budget airlines - Peach Air and Vanilla Air.   Sadly, going to Okinawa would make quite a dent in our budget -  the flight ticket prices at €350 for a round trip per person are just too expensive.  We do appreciate your suggestion though.   So no other suggestions for beaches besides Okinawa? They don't need to be the BEST beaches, just not really crappy ones, where the water is disgusting and you can't swim in it.     Last but not least, I have the same questions for you as I asked Vagabond_Sam: We're considering going to Disney Sea or Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park. Did you visit any of these? Any suggestions? Have to been to Hitachi Seaside Park? If yes, do you know if it's worth visiting in the summer?     Thank you so much for putting in the effort to answer our questions. We are really grateful. If you'll still be in Osaka while we're around, we really wouldn't mind taking you our for a beer, as promised in the original post! ;)"

The thing is, our AirBnb accommodation for Kyoto is already booked.   Well I've actually never stayed in Kyoto, I always make day trips there since I live in Osaka. Prior to living here, I did the same thing. Temples and shrines are cool but there are just too many kids everywhere, different schools take excursions to the main temples EVERY DAY. Even my friends that stayed in Kyoto for a week said it's overkill, too many of the same thing, will kill your mood for later. But hey, everyone's different.   So you think it's not worth actually staying at a place in Nara? Is half a day really enough? Should we just book something in Osaka instead? We are planning on being in this area for the last week of our stay. Would you say a week is too much in this case as well?   The main attraction in Nara is Todaiji Temple and the Deer park. Most people do this in half a day, 3/4 of a day MAX, and they're usually back in Osaka. There's nothing else there, well there's an abandoned theme park but it's closed to the public. I've heard of people jumping the fence around 3-4am.  There are plenty of things to do in Osaka. The Aquarium, USJ, Japanese Baseball Game, Umeda Sky Building, Osaka Castle, Endo Sushi (one of the best sushi places Osaka has to offer and at an affordable price) and many more. Find an Izakaya that offers 2 hours all you can drink for 1,000¥-1,500¥, get plastered! Mind you it's mainly Beer, Whiskey Highballs, Sours and Shochu. Plenty of nightlife and a few clubs scattered in Namba, Shinsaibashi and Umeda.  You can take a day trip to Okunoshima Island (Rabbit Island) this is a day trip, the quickest route is by Shinkansen as it's 2-2.5 hours each way of travel. Otherwise, take a side trip to Himeji, again day trip, Kobe or visit the Momofuku Instant Ramen Museum in Toyonaka.    Well, as I mentioned above. We're not really picky, we want to experience as much of Japan as possible. We actually aren't really sure what exactly we are looking for. Could you suggest something YOU really liked there? I'll ask you the same questions as Vagabond_Sam: While you were in Japan, was there anything you regret not seeing? And was there anything you saw that you thought was actually a waste of your time?   I live here atm so......... :P   Yeah, I actually know that, I just didn't phrase that question right at all. Let me try again: We were looking at the best options for travelling around Tokyo. Ideally, that would be an unlimited travel pass. We know that the JR-Pass is mostly only good for 1 line, so that's probably not a good idea. What about the Tokyo Free Pass? Is it worth its money or is it a better idea to just get a Suica and pay for every single ride we take.  Btw, I have an important question regarding the Suica/Pasmo: Let's say we go on a trip from X through Y to Z. With either of these cards, when you pay for a train from** X to Z, does it include **changing trains at Y or do they charge you for each individual train you take? Or am I completely wrong here? :D   I doubt you would be spending that much, perhaps in Osaka you would but a lot of things are in walking distance. Like Meiji Shrine is in walking distance of Harajuku but you could also take the train if you're lazy. Use Google maps and Hyperdia. It will give you a price break down, then you can decide to buy a pass or not.  It will calculate the cost of the train ride from X to Z, unless you actually exit the gates. Only when you exit the gates it will charge you. If you have insufficient funds, not to worry, there are Fare adjustment machines for you to top up. So if you had to go from X to Z but EXIT the gates at Y, because you're going from subway to JR train or the line is on a different side of the station, then it will charge you for X to Y and then Y to Z. It will show you how much it deducts on the gate.   Wow, this is really helpful: we didn't know we would have to make 9 transfers. We will probably reconsider taking the bullet train for both ways. Do round-trip tickets for Shinkansen exist? Do you suggest reserving seats beforehand? Keep in mind, we probably won't go for a JR-Pass.   I've always gotten reserve, so I can't comment. You can buy a return ticket, you just have to pick the day. On the day you're taking the return trip, you'll need to go to the ticket office again to have your seat allocated, if you bought a reserve ticket. Again, not sure what the process with unallocated seats.   Sadly, going to Okinawa would make quite a dent in our budget - the flight ticket prices at €350 for a round trip per person are just too expensive. We do appreciate your suggestion though. So no other suggestions for beaches besides Okinawa? They don't need to be the BEST beaches, just not really crappy ones, where the water is disgusting and you can't swim in it.   There are no beaches in Osaka itself, it's mainly just buildings after buildings. There are beaches in the Kansai area but it may take an hour or two on the train. I've never been to the beach here in Osaka... just due to the lack of them. Just google for beaches in Osaka or the Kansai region.   Last but not least, I have the same questions for you as I asked Vagabond_Sam: We're considering going to Disney Sea or Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park. Did you visit any of these? Any suggestions? Have to been to Hitachi Seaside Park? If yes, do you know if it's worth visiting in the summer?   I've been to Disney Sea Park, skipped in Disneyland since I've been to the one in HK. Most people say Disney Sea is for 16 yr olds and Disneyland is for children. Disney Sea was pretty fun, but the lines for some rides was OMG, 1 hour. Make sure you get there early and learn how to use the Fast Pass. Google Fast Pass Disney Sea/Disneyland, there are a lot of blogs with good pointers on there.  I would like to go to Fuji-Q Highland but my SO can't handle roller coasters and rides as well as I can. The rides there are a bit too extreme for her, lol. I would love to go and express the world's steepest roller coaster. There are buses that go there from Tokyo, I think they take 90 minutes!? All the information on how to get there would be on the Fuji-Q Highland website.  As for Hitachi Seaside Park, I haven't been. But here's the flower calendar, http://en.hitachikaihin.jp/flower-calendar.html. Looks like you'll miss a lot of the good ones!  Haha I didn't even notice that in the original post. Beers here are cheap as, no biggy!"

Don't know about the ferry, but JAL seems to run multiple flights per day out there from Kagoshima, and a quick glance for next week showed that there were still a number of flights available.  Good luck!"
JapanTravel,36j4kc,nomusicnolife,1 point,Wed May 20 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"I had an itinerary planned out to use my Japan rail pass to travel via shinkansen from Tokyo to Kagoshima then take the last ferry out to Yakushima. I checked their website and they said it was sold out.  I called the ferry terminal as soon as they opened today and they did not have any non-reserve tickets after all. They do not have an English site that I know of, so I wonder how foreigners can get these tickets when they sell out.  I called JAL about their ""Welcome to Japan"" fare and they said that since the flight to Yakushima from Kagoshima is a JAL subsidiary and not JAL themselves, so the fare does not apply making it ~$600 per person. I checked various other low cost airlines and found that they are around $250 a person from Tokyo to Kagoshima to get an earlier ferry.   I finally checked ANA's ""Experience Japan"" fare and found that they offer very cheap tickets (less than ~$100 per person) using this special fare. I was able to get the ticket and reserve an earlier ferry and am out about $200 more than I would have been for me and my wife. Not as bad as it could have been."
JapanTravel,36j4kc,david_131,2,Wed May 20 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"Glad you got a flight. Did you try Jetstar Japan who fly Narita to Kagoshima? Sunday 24th is around 7,700 yen one way for the early flight which arrives in Kagoshima at 9:35am."
JapanTravel,36j4kc,david_131,1 point,Wed May 20 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"I checked it, but I wanted to fly out of Haneda if possible and the ANA tickets from there with the ""Experience Japan"" rates were just a few hundred yen more.

All the earlier ones were available on that day still, though.  I did a quick check on their website, but it does not allow you to reserve tickets online with less than 3 days notice. I would recommend calling them if you can or you might risk losing your chance if there are tickets still available. Their phone number is (+9) 099-226-0128.

JapanTravel,36k5sb,nomusicnolife,1 point,Wed May 20 00:49:12 2015 UTC,Which convenience store? Me and my friend will only arrive in tokyo on 14th of july should i buy it from the convenience store or reserve it online? As for reserving it online can foreigners do that?
JapanTravel,36k5sb,Extremely_Agreeable,3,Wed May 20 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"Circle K/Sunkus (591-200), Lawson (31717), Seven Eleven (591-200), and Family Mart will all be selling them. You use the Multi-Purpose machines in the shop to reserve one using the ticket codes listed above (it said with Family Mart you have to use the menu to navigate to where the tickets are being sold instead of entering a code).  Usually it's difficult for foreigners to buy tickets during the lottery/reserve period because they either want a Japanese address or a Japan-issued credit card. :( Not sure about this time. But there have been a few posts on here talking about ticket buying services you can use that will try and reserve tickets for you. Maybe try one of those?"
JapanTravel,36k5sb,nomusicnolife,2,Wed May 20 01:25:23 2015 UTC,Thanks you very much for all this info. Hopefully we will be able to buy tickets from convience stores on the 14th. If we don't then our other alternative is watching the yokohama baystars.

JapanTravel,36ih39,jgold16,5,Tue May 19 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"With a difference of 8140 yen and what seems to be 7 days in Tokyo, no, It's not worth it. Don't forget not all areas of Tokyo are JR accessible (Asakusa/Skytree/Roppongi/Odaiba,) so money not spent on the pass can be better utilized riding other lines."
JapanTravel,36ih39,aaaaaaha,1 point,Tue May 19 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"If you can time it right, getting the 7-day pass would probably benefit you.  Just looking at your schedule briefly you may be one day over, but if you could fit your outside Tokyo time to 7 days, you would only be paying 29110 to travel instead of 38250.  Also - the JR Pass won't help you get from Narita to Shinjuku, so that's still out of your pocket."
JapanTravel,36ih39,itsavgbltpta,3,Tue May 19 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, thats an interesting suggestion.   http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2027.html says JR Narita Express is covered by JR pass. So Narita to Shinjuku should be covered."
JapanTravel,36ih39,itsavgbltpta,1 point,Tue May 19 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"I had no idea it was covered by the JR Pass!  Thanks for clearing that up!  I don't know why I didn't think it was, sorry.  For your circumstances though, if you get the 7 day pass, I'd not activate the JR Pass until going from Tokyo to Kyoto.  The N'EX price isn't too bad on it's own, and sometimes they run specials - like a round trip ticket for 4000 yen right now."
JapanTravel,36ih39,david_131,2,Tue May 19 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"Just confirming that Narita Express is definitely covered by the JR Pass. You just have to reserve seats, free of charge."
JapanTravel,36ih39,Gurtang,2,Tue May 19 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"The 7 days would not cover Osaka-Shinjuku, making the 7-day pass more expensive. My lodging is booked so I don't want to move it around."
JapanTravel,36ih39,david_131,1 point,Tue May 19 21:14:55 2015 UTC,"You should either fit your trip outside Tokyo in 7 days, or travel more to make the 14 Day pass worth it. For exemple go to hiroshima and/or himeji."
JapanTravel,36ih39,david_131,1 point,Wed May 20 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"As you mention, 14-day JR Pass won't really pay off. If you modify your itinerary slightly and return from Osaka to Tokyo late in the evening of Day 10 then you could get a 7-day JR Pass with activation date of Day 4. Even a 7-day JR Pass won't really save you much unless you plan on a longer day trip from Kyoto to somewhere like Hiroshima/Miyajima.    I'd probably not get any pass, and just pay for individual tickets unless you are on a tight budget.  Note that your costs for Kyoto - Koyasan - Osaka seem high for the JR component. I would just take the (non-Shinkansen) trains to Namba and then buy Koyasan World Heritage Ticket there:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2358_012.html"
JapanTravel,36ih39,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Tue May 19 20:55:18 2015 UTC,"That does seem like a much simpler way to get to Koyasan, thanks. We are planning a day trip to Himeji castle from Kyoto, which it seems is 5270 one way for the cheapest fare. This would take my 7-day total, including Osaka-Shinjuku, to 39980 (13910+800+14730+5270+5270)."
JapanTravel,36ih39,nibill,1 point,Tue May 19 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"For a one day trip from Kyoto/Osaka to Himeji to see Himeji Castle I recommend you buy the JR West Kansai Area One Day Pass (2200yen). The pass is explained here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_03.html Note that you can also buy this special pass in Japan at Kyoto Station if you wish, it is just 100 yen more expensive, which may end up being cheaper for you depending on how close you are to an official agency in your country that sells them (like JTB).     This pass and the access is explained here also in Himeji Access from Kyoto:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3504.html?aFROM=2158_3500    I would usually suggest Himeji in the morning and then you can consider using the pass to go elsewhere in the afternoon if you like."

Head off the next day and either stop at Nagano for a while, or go straight to Tokyo which is perfectly doable.  The one downside, it is expensive. Personally I really believe it's worth it though. I did the alpine route and it was amazing - the one regret of my trip to Japan was not staying up there overnight. Perfect clear sky; would have been amazing."

Will you be on a tourist visa? There are some other economical passes which include Kanazawa which may be useful for you.    The ""usual"" loop back used to be Kyoto - Kanazawa - Shirakawago - Takayama - Tokyo. With the Hokuriku Shinkansen you can consider heading back via Nagano although most of the interesting sites are a bit outside Nagano itself."

You may also want to test apps out with your phone in airplane mode to see if they still work that way (i.e., without data).  I'm mapping my itinerary in a Google Map which I'm planning to export as KML and then import into an offline maps app. I tried a few different apps, but maps.me is the one I like best precisely because of this feature. Not sure if I'll use it as my backup or as my primary map tool in Japan.  A currency converter is going to be handy to have. There are quite a few out there; I chose one pretty much at random.  Hyperdia is the handiest looking app I've found for train travel, especially with its JR Pass filter. It needs data. I've seen a few other train timetable & map apps but they don't seem to be kept up to date and AFAICT they offer nothing a paper map doesn't already provide.  For translation, I'm looking forward to trying out yomiwa. If you have data, the iOS version of Google Translate recently added a similar camera-based translation service (it's been in the Android version forever), which probably works better.  If you'd like an interactive travel guide type thing, City Maps 2Go and TripAdvisor City Guides have downloadable city guides for Tokyo and Kyoto. I haven't played with their Tokyo/Kyoto guides much yet, but have had luck with their London and Paris guides in the past."

Can you move Koyasan back a day and just go direct from Koyasan to Kansai Airport?    Overall it looks nice though. I probably wouldn't spend the night in Nara unless you have a specific reason to. You already move around a lot so I would just daytrip from Osaka to Nara, and use Osaka as a base. ie. Spend the night of Day 10 through to the morning of Day 13 in Osaka. I'd probably even consider not spending the night in Himeji and just spend it in Osaka, or extend your Kyoto stay and day trip to Himeji from Kyoto perhaps.    Hakone is relatively easy to access without a JR Pass by just buying the Hakone Free Pass at Shinjuku Station so you can also consider just setting the activation date of the JR Pass as ""Day 5"".

JapanTravel,36h60s,momotaro-san,1 point,Tue May 19 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"3 days in Osaka and Kyoto seems the minimum. Osaka may be enough to stay one day (visit Umeda sky building, Osaka castle, Dotombori/Namba area and try Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki and Kushikatsu), and with two days in Kyoto you can cover the most famous places in Kyoto such as Fushimi Inari shrine, Kiyomizu temple, Nijo castle, Kinkaku temple and Arashiyama, even though Kyoto still has too many places to visit.  Tohoku and Hokkaido are are really big, so if you spend 4 days moving from Tokyo to Hokkaido using the Seishun 18 Kippu, I think you need to spend almost half of the time in a local train. I recommend the JR pass if acceptable. I think visiting the Japan Sea side in Tohoku (Yamagata and Akita pref.) is a good option. This region is one of the most old-fashioned country side in Japan, which you can find many local foods, traditional scenary and onsen. Though it is an inconvenient country side, I would recommend it if you are interested in."

JapanTravel,36fhol,sharky1313,2,Mon May 18 23:54:36 2015 UTC,"Hokkaido? Usually that is where the best resorts are considered to be. Might be too touristy for you though.   Otherwise there are probably hundreds of Ski resorts all throughout the mountains of Tohoku from Fulushima to Aomori.   The real question at that point becomes how good are your Japanese communication skills, as once you get away from the touristy sights English levels tend to drop sharply which can make things like transportation and lodging a bit more difficult.   I'm not a big skier but I've been to 3 places in Tohoku myself. A small slope in Karumai Iwate prefecture. Really small lodge, just a shop and a restraunt, cheapest lift fees I have ever seen at 2000 yen for a full day. But impossible to get to without a car.   Alts Bandai in Fukushima prefecture, it was definately the biggest I have been to, several slopes, big modern lodge. I think they run a bus from Aizu Wakamatsu.   Aizu Kogen Takatsue in Fukushima prefecture, generally heard good things about this place from skiers, said it's the best in Fukushima. Couple of lodges, lots of hotels and some Onsen around it as well. Pretty out of the way but I think they do run a bus service from the nearest train station. It was my favorite place and I would have liked to ski there more."

I'd usually suggest you stay in Kyoto and use it as a base but you may prefer to spend it in Osaka.    Depending on your budget and if you climb Mt Fuji you may also wish to consider a night in a ryokan somewhere. Kawaguchiko or Hakone would be obvious choices.

I spend a couple weeks in Nara, and this is what I did:   Inari Mountain. It's free, it's beautiful and the Inari train station is really beautiful.   Wakakusayama in Nara. If you walk through the park, past the ukimido pavilion and then to the left, up the small hill that leads to a really old and traditional neighborhood and then back through the forest that is full of old wooden buildings, temple areas, staircases, paths with lanterns and so on, you will see some of the most beautiful and amazing places in Nara, ending with Wakakusayama which is incredibly beautiful in itself. AND THE DEER  Arashiyama. The train ride from Kyoto Station had such a beautiful view. The bamboo forest is beautifu and the whole area near the giant Arashiyama river is beautiful. I walked some other way home and ended up in a place somewhat far away from the normal tourist path. There was a ""temple"", but it was more like a big area with a zen garden and other cool things. It was at the foot of a mountain. The giant, steep staircase that led up to the top went through something I'd describe as a cliffside graveyard. At the top, there was a long path through a forest-like area, and at the end of this path, there was a bench in front of an opening in the wall of trees. From here, you could see the entire city. Absolutely beautiful.   Kinkakuji is a must and it's really cheap."

The things that make any particular country unique. Every country has temples and shrines.   So like akihabara and seeing all the interesting anime otaku stuff. That robot show dinner thing. Friend and I may climb Mt fuji. Trying to see some unique Japanese night life. Food and cuisine. I dunno... I like lots of stuff... But shrines and temples make up soo much of people's posted itineraries it seems like overkill   Another thing that comes to mind is I like interacting and meeting locals. Hanging out and partying with. But that may be difficult given my lack of Japanese lol

You will need to book your Osaka and Kyoto accommodation well in advance as that is the peak of the peak due to autumn colours. I would highly recommend visiting a few of the illuminations in Kyoto. Dates/times will be updated closer to November:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3953.html On the morning of the 25th I would go to Kitano Tenmangu Shrine for the temple market. After the market I would go to the garden as it is only open for limited days throughout the year and is very nice in autumn:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3939.html You can combine Kitano Tenmangu with Kinkakuji if you wish. Travel back to Tokyo in the evening of the 25th. In Fukuoka you could have dinner at one of the Yatai stalls by the canal after the Sumo. Note that they are not that cheap though. I assume you spend the night in Hiroshima on the 20th? And the night in Fukuoka on the 21st? There's also some nice autumn colour spots in Tokyo for your last section too:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3061.html    Do not underestimate how crowded/busy Kyoto will be! Avoid the buses as much as possible unless you start at a terminal like Kyoto Station. Even then there will be very long queues. Use the subway and walking as much as possible. Make sure you visit Tofukuji:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3930.html    Timing for the colours does vary year to year so usually reading the Japan-guide blog reports are useful in the lead up, and during your trip. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014.html    I would highly recommend you rent a pocket wifi or at least get a data SIM while you are in Japan.    Note that you have miscalculated the JR Pass. If you start a 7-day JR Pass on the 18th the last day you can use it is the 24th, not the 25th! You may need to adjust your schedule (I'd drop one day from Osaka) or just get a 14-day JR Pass.

JapanTravel,36dghy,rainbow_city,6,Tue May 19 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"Now, I do come from Scandinavia and I have very sensitive eyes and somewhat sensitive skin as well, so this is just my experience. I thought I'd let you know what it was like for me.  In Nara, you could easily walk around naked outside in the middle of the night and still feel warm. I was only wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and even though it had been dark for around 7 hours at that point, it was still 23 degrees celsius and about 100% humidity. If you are walking around or climbing Inari Mountain like I did, you will even sweat like a pig. Like I did.   I spent an entire night outside in Tokyo in July, wearing nothing but short and a t-shirt. I did not at any point feel uncomfortable except for when the sun came up and roasted me. In other words, it does not get too cold, but it definitely gets too hot.  During the day, you might even feel a slight ""burning"" sensation on your skin if it's particularly hot, the UV index is high and you are just standing in the sun. This was a huge problem for me when I was waiting for the light to turn green at intersections, because that takes a long time.. The air is thick and it will almost feel like you are swimming through it. Walking outside from a store or a house with AC will be like walking into a flaming wall, an oven or a thick sauce that surrounds your body.   When I was in Osaka, it was about 38 degrees. My body was dying when I was in the shadow, and as soon as I walked out of the train station and into the sunlight.... Man, I can't explain it. The sun was so bright that I could barely keep my eyes open, and my skin was stinging and.. yeah, not fun.  Also, you will probably be drenched in sweat from sunrise to sunset if you sweat easily. The humidity itself is enough to make you sweat.  Even when it had been super cloudy for three days straight and I walked outside on the third night right before sunrise after it had been dark for like 10 hours, it still felt incredibly warm and humid.   I know a few people from Florida who say that Summer in Kansai is warmer and more humid than back home. So there's that. But hey, I kind of liked it."

JapanTravel,36dghy,RaigekiAKH,1 point,Tue May 19 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"The first couple of days I was there, I could literally feel the thick air around my body when I moved my arm or walked around. Thick sauce, yes ):  I was in Japan from July 2nd to somewhere in the end of July, so yeah. But hey, I managed to climb mountains and spend most days outside anyway. Just bring water and you will get used to it :) I actually missed the heat a little bit when I came home."

JapanTravel,36br6y,david_131,3,Tue May 19 06:35:47 2015 UTC,I'd agree with the other commenters. 7 days is a solid amount of time to spend in Tokyo. Kyoto is great and is a totally different side to Japan but it'll be pretty expensive for only a couple of days. Try looking into a day trip (Kamakura)  Edit: Oops..
JapanTravel,36br6y,david_131,2,Mon May 18 11:02:54 2015 UTC,Ha I wish I was staying for 7 weeks!
JapanTravel,36br6y,david_131,2,Mon May 18 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"A week in Tokyo is fine. You can do a few day trips or overnight trips from there if you like. Usually I would suggest Kamakura, or Nikko to experience some of the temples/shrines/nature. I would also consider a day trip or overnight to Kawaguchiko or Hakone in the hopes of seeing Mt Fuji. These are all explained under Side Trips here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2164.html    It depends on your preferences but considering you have 9/10 days I would probably have considered a few days in Kyoto to see Kyoto, maybe Nara, maybe Himeji Castle. Doing this I'd split your time 5 days in each and maybe split your Tokyo days so that you have a couple at the start in Tokyo and a couple at the end in Tokyo. http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1105.html    Including Kyoto would obviously increase your costs a bit but if you are on a budget you can consider an overnight bus or flying with one of the LCCs like Peach or Jetstar Japan."
JapanTravel,36br6y,david_131,1 point,Mon May 18 02:45:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'll definitely look into spending some time in the Kyoto area. I was looking at taking the JR, it seems like less of a struggle than flying."
JapanTravel,36br6y,gisdaman,2,Mon May 18 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"If you want to use the Shinkansen then I would probably consider purchasing a 7-day JR Pass before you come to Japan. Use it to get from Tokyo to Kyoto and back. This will also allow you to be a bit flexible and visit some of the other places from Kyoto as mentioned. If you can, try and time it so that it also covers your transport back to the airport in Tokyo especially if that is Narita."
JapanTravel,36br6y,reol7x,1 point,Mon May 18 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I was looking at the JR Pass, definitely. It would be cheaper if I went to Kyoto since I'd be using the JR to go to Disneyland and the airport and whatnot. I would time it to get me to Narita, but I leave at 8:30 am and there's no way I'm bringing the souvenirs I buy to Kyoto and back. I'd probably want an extra day in Tokyo to get all the ridiculous things I can get for everyone."
JapanTravel,36br6y,pazuzu6666,1 point,Mon May 18 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"Cool, depends then on how many days you want in Osaka/Kyoto and how many days you have in Tokyo at the end before you depart. With an 8:30am flight home from Narita I would probably consider spending the night at a hotel near Narita. Early morning trains are a little awkward for ones that get you to Narita Airport by 6:30am. You can check timetables on www.hyperdia.com"
JapanTravel,36br6y,pazuzu6666,1 point,Mon May 18 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"I was considering maybe 2-3 days in the Kyoto/Osaka area, but if there's enough to see in Tokyo, it can always wait until next trip out to Asia.   I was hoping to splurge on a nice hotel on the last night, something near Narita like you suggested. Especially since you're saying the trains are a bit odd that early.

Japan is a good destination. With 14 days I would not spend the whole time in Tokyo. Tour may be fine if you can find a nice one at a reasonable price that departs around your dates. In general I would plan your own but not sure how much time you have for that.    Simple rough itinerary is Tokyo for 5/6 days, Kyoto for 5/6 days and a couple of days elsewhere.    Common day trips from Kyoto would be Nara, Osaka, Himeji Castle. Maybe Hiroshima/Miyajima although maybe not on a honeymoon. http://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1105.html    You may wish to consider on overnight or two in a ryokan in Hakone or Kawaguchiko for a view of Mt Fuji and an Onsen (hot spring) experience. http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/index.htm http://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/ http://www.japanican.com/ http://travel.rakuten.co.jp/en/"

JapanTravel,36c7w1,Adderkleet,2,Mon May 18 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"14 days? Take in Tokyo and Osaka (and Kyoto if you want to!). Get a JR Pass so you can just show up and get on the bullet train. It's going to take a long time to get there, so you might want to pay for two one-way flights (Home > Tokyo and Osaka > Home) or get the train from the airport to the ""far"" city (Flying to Tokyo-Narita: train to Osaka on day 1)  Tour group? If you want to pay the extra to remove the worry about where to go and what to do, book a tour group. I found it was about $500~$1000 more for a tour holiday rather than DIY. Find out what places the tour would visit and just book things to match (or just pay for the tour).  You probably won't get ripped off. You may find yourself in an expensive department store or district. Just relocate to the side-streets or a different main street.  Hotels? I used booking.com for both trips to Japan (except for the few days booked in Hakone {which you should do! Private onsen would be a nice break}). Most hotels I found allowed me to pay when I arrived, or cancel without losing a deposit."
JapanTravel,36c7w1,Adderkleet,2,Mon May 18 08:49:12 2015 UTC,Would you suggest landing in Narita rather than Haneda? Is there much of a difference between the two?
JapanTravel,36c7w1,reol7x,1 point,Mon May 18 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"Narita was the only available airport for Tokyo when I flew there. Haneda seems a lot closer to the city. If it's an option and the price is similar (or lower), go with Haneda."

The one in Akihabara is almost impossible to miss, it's right next to the station there (northwestish side of the station). The Diver City one is next to the gigantic Gundam outside of the mall.  We ended up stopping in both, had ice cream in one. I was a little disappointed with the Gundam cafe, we saw many other themed cafes in Akihabara, and a few others throughout Japan. Universally, they were overpriced and seemed very ""touristy"" to us. After going to the Gundam one, we decided against going to any others, for better or worse.  Gundam Front also at DiverCity in Odaiba is a much better Gundam experience than the cafe, they've got a large one outside and a museum inside the mall, I think it was the top floor."

We'll just be staying in Tokyo. Taking the train to Osaka/Kyoto is probably gonna blow our budget. We would prefer private rooms though. Growing up in a country where the crime rate is pretty high and most cops being on someone's payroll has made us pretty paranoid about safety lol.

JapanTravel,36bmsw,david_131,3,Mon May 18 06:47:20 2015 UTC,"Shinjuku is a good area to stay for tourists and is usually my default suggestion.

Usually around 3,500-5,000 yen each way. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2366.html http://willerexpress.com/en/    As you no doubt know Japan is relatively very safe so you should have no real issues there.

Spending one night there With huge amounts of kms to cover to get there is not a smart option. Stay at least 2 nights in each.  Hakone tent was one of my favourite accommodations, really great location for Fuji.  2-3 nights in Osaka is probably a good amount, but just leave enough time for train travel. Yes, the trains are fast but they're not as fast as the speed of light.  I feel like your trip spends too much time in Kyoto and Tokyo and not enough time in the others. You're already doing a lot, spend 5 days in Kyoto and 5-6 days in Tokyo and spread out your days to the other places.  Btw universal studios can be a big waste of money, or a big waste of time.

I had an extremely flexible budget budget but having to buy a fast pass on top of the ticket. I know my friend spent a lot of money for it and I know my BF wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  Train travel takes longer than you think. You should add an extra hour travel time as it can take some time to figure out train times and get to other stations and platforms.

JapanTravel,36an3j,david_131,1 point,Tue May 19 11:40:51 2015 UTC,You don't have to pay for a quick pass but if you want to not stand in line for hours... get the pass  There are free timed entry tickets for HP and so on.   I enjoyed myself two times without a fast pass but had to wait looong times
JapanTravel,36an3j,Tw1987,1 point,Tue May 19 02:55:35 2015 UTC,Exactly summed up perfectly.
JapanTravel,36an3j,david_131,2,Tue May 19 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"Is the pace good?      I would definitely recommend some changes. Pace is slow for Tokyo and then quite fast in parts and too fast in others.   Is there any travel time we're unrealistic about (too cramped / too slow)?     Yes. No time in Kanazawa, add a night in Kanazawa, or two. I'd probably add a night for Shirakawago/Takayama too.  Not enough time in Hiroshima at all, add a night in Hiroshima, or two.  I also don't like the Hiroshima - Tokyo journey so I would be inclined to break that up. Maybe Kyoto - Koyasan - Hiroshima - Osaka - Tokyo would be better.     Do we spend too much time somewhere?     Tokyo. Probably Osaka, what do you plan on doing in Osaka? Maybe do Himeji just as a day trip from Osaka which will reduce your in transit time on other days. Maybe combine Kobe with Himeji if you want Kobe Beef.     Do we visit too similar places? Is there anything we should skip?      No, seems fine to me.   Do we miss an incredible festival somewhere by a day?     I would highly recommend going to the Sumo in Tokyo at the end. Sumo is Sep 13-27. Buy tickets in advance either direct or through www.buysumotickets.com    Which festivals are you referring to on 29/30 Aug?   Are there days we should switch do to crowds/weekend costs?     Nothing obvious.     We're currently researching cooking classes/workshops in Tokyo, and hope to attend at least one. Any recommendations would be great.     Friends enjoyed Buddha Bellies in Tokyo:- http://buddhabelliestokyo.jimdo.com/ And this one in Nara:- http://www.naracookeryschool.jp/     Also, we understood you can send your luggage directly between hotels. Is it true for all hotels, or does it depend on the receiving/outgoing hotel?     Maybe not all hotels but certainly the vast majority can handle Takuhaibin. I wouldn't really recommend it given the fast pace of your itinerary but may be useful for some in-between hops I guess, like around Koyasan. ie. ship from Osaka to Hiroshima and just take overnight bag to Koyasan. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html    To be honest you should travel as light as possible with this itinerary and make sure you are comfortable carrying your luggage up and down stairs.     Can you send your luggage a day or two before you're going to arrive?     Note that almost all of the takuhaibin services are an overnight send. So if you check out in the morning of the 9th from your hotel in Tokyo and send to your hotel in Kyoto it will not arrive at the hotel in Kyoto until the 10th. ie. won't be there when you check in the afternoon of the 9th. Note with almost all of the services you can specify a delivery date up to seven days away. Most hotels will be able to handle your luggage arriving the day before you check in if you really had to, though it always is useful to check/confirm with them.     Any advice would be helpful!

JapanTravel,36an3j,RealArc,1 point,Mon May 18 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the incredibly detailed response!   Pace is slow for Tokyo and then quite fast in parts and too fast in others.   There are 3 reasons for slower pace in Tokyo:   We arrive by a very very long flight, on the morning of the 20th, so we imagine at least 1 day will be spent sleeping in/feeling like shit. At least a 1 day of the non field-trip days, will be spent in cooking workshops such as: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1066444-d3640609-Reviews-Japanese_Cooking_Class_Tokyo_with_Mari-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html The festivals in 29-30, namely:    Harajuku Omotesando Genki Koenji Awa-Odori Asakusa Samba Festival   Those seem like the main summer festivals, we'd hate to miss them. On the other hand, it's difficult to discern which festivals are the real deal, since all festivals have dedicated pages praising them as 'the best/largest tokyo festival'. :)  Is this good reasoning, or should we still reconsider?   No time in Kanazawa, add a night in Kanazawa, or two.  Long research lead us to believe Kanazawa to be a grade B attraction. Except for the Kenrokuen the rest seems poor. The Ninjadera is Japanese only tour, and has 'no talking'. The historical districts don't seem to add much over other cities. Plenty of tips we read said ""in hindsight, we'd skip Kanazawa for another night in Kyoto"".   Honestly we want to skip Kanazawa, but we need a place to stay after the Alpine route, and there is only a single late train to Takayama, which we fear to miss.   I'd probably add a night for Shirakawago/Takayama too.    We plan to spend a night in either Shirakawa go or Takayama (Sept. 7)   Not enough time in Hiroshima at all, add a night in Hiroshima, or two. I also don't like the Hiroshima - Tokyo journey so I would be inclined to break that up. Maybe Kyoto - Koyasan - Hiroshima - Osaka - Tokyo would be better.   Beyond the peace park and Miyajima there seems little to do. I agree it's cramped. We see it as the weakest part of the trip, and we will probably change.   Maybe do Himeji just as a day trip from Osaka which will reduce your in transit time on other days. Maybe combine Kobe with Himeji if you want Kobe Beef.   The idea was to use Himeji as a fun stop to break up the trip to Hiroshima. Is that a bad idea? Do you think it creates too much train travel for that day?   I would highly recommend going to the Sumo in Tokyo at the end. Sumo is Sep 13-27. Buy tickets in advance either direct or through www.buysumotickets.com   Sumo and Tokyo game expo are things we're considering for Sept. 23rd.   Friends enjoyed Buddha Bellies in Tokyo:- http://buddhabelliestokyo.jimdo.com/ And this one in Nara:- http://www.naracookeryschool.jp/   Much appreciated!    Note that almost all of the takuhaibin services are an overnight send.    Ha! Our impression was that this usually takes a day (ie: send it in 8AM, and it arrives on same day after noon)   may be useful for some in-between hops I guess, like around Koyasan. ie. ship from Osaka to Hiroshima and just take overnight bag to Koyasan.   This is exactly what we hoped to do for single night stays, which is why we asked about sending luggage in advance.  Thanks for all the advice! We have a lot to think about."
JapanTravel,36an3j,RealArc,1 point,Mon May 18 09:32:51 2015 UTC,When you recommend packing would a Carry On luggage fit that criteria? Also first time I have read about the Luggage directly between hotels. If this is really an option that would be neat to bring an actually luggage cause you can only fit so much into a carry on. We just didn't want to bring our luggage on the JR when we travel from osaka to tokyo (bad experience from england to france haha)
JapanTravel,36an3j,RealArc,1 point,Mon May 18 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"Carry on would be good, but even a larger suitcase that you are comfortable carrying up and down stairs would be fine. Takuhaibin is useful but like I mentioned due to the overnight delivery it may not match your itinerary.    I would always just take my luggage between Osaka and Tokyo and almost all other city pairings. What's your specific itinerary? You can see some of the luggage storage options on the trains here:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2274.html"

I would see a shrine or temple so add either Meiji Jingu when you go to Harajuku, or add Asakusa and Sensoji before Akihabara. I would not recommend staying at Narita unless you have a very early flight departure.    You can use www.hyperdia.com for train fares/timetables.    Buy a Suica/Pasmo when you arrive and use it for your train transport:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html    I would add in one of the observation decks, maybe Tokyo Metro Government Building in Shinjuku which is free. I like dusk/evening there and it is open fairly late so maybe after your Shibuya day. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3057.html    Tokyu Food Court down the steps to the left of Hachiko in Shibuya is usually worth a look."

JapanTravel,36b6k7,reol7x,1 point,Mon May 18 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"Departure seems fine. You can check late trains from Tokyo to your hotel near Narita by using the station names in Hyperdia, just set arrival time as 1am or something to give you an idea. Some hotels will have a shuttle bus from Narita Airport to the hotel but you may need to check what times they operate, alternatively just go directly to the hotel."
JapanTravel,36b6k7,_kashmir_,1 point,Mon May 18 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"Which means you'll get into central tokyo at around 4pm. Narita is at least an hour away, and considering you need to get to the airport well before your flight, you're realistically looking at 2 days+change."
JapanTravel,36b6k7,reol7x,1 point,Mon May 18 03:35:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see anyone asking your arrival time, but we landed in Narita close to 6:00 pm, by the time we got to Tokyo, had a snack, and checked in to our room, it was close to 8:00 pm.  We went to be early and woke up feeling great. Didn't really have jet-lag while we were there.   A side-effect of this, is when we returned home, I feel like it hit us double-hard. I think it effects everyone different, but an early bed first night may help you out if you have a late-ish arrival."

JapanTravel,369qw8,FreshOreo,1 point,Sun May 17 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I would split your time fairly equally between Kyoto and Tokyo with a day trip from Kyoto to Nara. I would try to spend at least 2 days in Osaka though. So you could do like 5-6days Kyoto, Tokyo and then 2 days Osaka and find other day trips to do, especially eith your rail pass"
JapanTravel,369qw8,hdiz,0,Sun May 17 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"I suggest you do some research, figure out what you want to see, and then plan your itinerary. We spent 10 days in and around Kyoto becuz our son lives there and he had Golden Week off. One day in Osaka, one day in Nara, one day in Kobe. Then we spent 3 days in Tokyo without our son. We hadn't had time to do any Tokyo research before the trip, so we only had what I would call one truly quality day there. (Hell, it took an hour just to figure out the Metro line after being used to using buses and the JR in Kyoto since we speak no japanese and didn't have a guidebook or map in English!)  Obviously you could find way more to do in Osaka than one day's worth. We mostly did what our son recommended this trip as it's our first time there and he wanted to show us his world. We'll do different things on return trips, assuming our son stays there instead of moving back to the USA."
JapanTravel,369qw8,HeadBrainiac,1 point,Sun May 17 19:04:59 2015 UTC,Is the JR system not used as much inner city for tokyo?
JapanTravel,369qw8,Tw1987,1 point,Mon May 18 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't appear so on the map to us. But the Yamamote (green) JR line stops walking distance from many tourist highlights (Shinbuku -- TMGO, Park Hyatt [definitely worth an $18 cocktail to sit in the bar on the 52nd floor where they shot Lost in Translation -- just be aware there is a ¥2,000 cover charge for non-hotel guests after 20:00], Shibuya [Meiji Shrine, the glorious 5-point pedestrian scramble], etc.).  We bought a one-day all-inclusive metro-JR-bus pass for £1,590 but determined it was cheaper to pay separately for tickets and passes."
JapanTravel,36auuw,fallenheero,3,Sun May 17 21:36:14 2015 UTC,Since the Sunday with Hiroshima is such a big day of travelling maybe you could go straight to Osaka then and see Hiroshima on either the Monday or the Tuesday as you don't seem to have anything set in stone in those days :)   Have a great trip!
JapanTravel,36auuw,alfie1806,2,Sun May 17 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"day 8... do you plan to travel to hiroshima that morning from tokyo, then go to osaka that same night? if so, tokyo to hiroshima is like....5 hours, then back to osaka is another hour and a half. that's a LOT of travel in one day."

JapanTravel,36auuw,Zweifuss,1 point,Sun May 17 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Given you'll have a JR Pass, consider staying at just one of Osaka & Kyoto and day-tripping to the other one. It's just 15 minutes by shinkansen, lots of trains through the day, just hop on and off."
JapanTravel,36auuw,AshleyYakeley,1 point,Sun May 17 23:25:33 2015 UTC,really? it's a viable strategy?
JapanTravel,36auuw,david_131,2,Mon May 18 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you have a JR Pass, otherwise it might be expensive. I stayed in Osaka last time and day-tripped to Kyoto. The fastest shinkansen trains take 13 minutes and there are lots of them (except avoid Nozomi trains which JR Pass doesn't cover). No need for reservations; just hop on and sit in an unreserved car. Just treat it like a (free) subway train.  In general I found the JR Pass incredibly liberating, since I could just walk straight to the platform and hop on the next train."
JapanTravel,36auuw,Heinemenusch,1 point,Tue May 19 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"What date is ""1st Day""? Have you booked any hotels? You should exchange your voucher for the JR Pass when you arrive just make sure you specify ""the 8th day"" as your activation date. You can make your seat reservations as soon as you have the actual JR Pass. This will save a lot of time on the morning of ""the 8th day"".    I would not go directly to Hiroshima due to the 5 hour trip especially as you don't plan on staying overnight. Just go direct to Osaka or Kyoto and sightsee in that city. Then the following day do a long day trip to Hiroshima. If you only plan on seeing the Peace Park/Museum then I would consider including Miyajima also.  http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html Alternatively, the Mazda Museum and Factory Tour is quite interesting. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3405.html    No, you don't spend too long in Kyoto/Osaka. If anything you have too long in Tokyo and not enough elsewhere. If you tire of Kyoto/Osaka you can day trip to the other. You can also consider a half-day/day trip to Himeji Castle:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3501.html"

I didnt know you could pre book so I'll do that, Thanks!  Hm I see that the general consensus is its probably a bad idea to go to hiroshima directly, I'll probably go to kyoto and day trip from there.  I realise I'm spending a fair amount of time in Tokyo but its more because my friend can't afford to get a JR pass and theres a fair amount I want to do in Tokyo which I haven't scheduled into the days as of yet."
JapanTravel,36auuw,Tw1987,1 point,Mon May 18 11:41:14 2015 UTC,"Personally I would increase my time in Kyoto at the expense of Osaka. In fact I wouldn't even bother with Osaka: it's a rather ugly industrial city and even its impressive castle is a modern (1970s) fake built out of concrete.  Base yourself in Kyoto and visit:  In Kyoto:   The Imperial Palace: you have to apply in advance for an invitation but it's a formality. Riyoan-Ji. Impressive temple complex. Nijo castle. There are several other temples in the same area worth visting but I forget their names: shameful! :)   There's also a street-market ""alley"" worth visiting -kind of a covered market- worth visiting but I can remember what that's called either.  Day trips:   Himeji Castle, the real thing, easily do-able as a day trip. Nara, again easy day trip. (But you could spend several days there). Hiroshima. Easy day trip if you start early. Castle and the bomb park are both worth seeing. An extra day would allow you to include a trip to Miyajima island, although it's almost always fog bound and rainy."
JapanTravel,36965n,DarkRuiner,6,Sun May 17 11:39:56 2015 UTC,"While I don't know if it is possible (beyond using a travel agent), it's relatively easy to do in JR stations."

JapanTravel,36965n,RealArc,4,Sun May 17 14:20:43 2015 UTC,"A friend and I bought regular tickets (no pass or any discount) like 15 minutes before departure.  Most Japanese do it like that unless it's holiday season.  THAT SAID, in the case of Puratto Kodama you indeed have to reserve the ticket at least a day in advance.  I think this is going to be difficult for you. Blogs say if you buy it online (you need the Japanese address for that and Japanese language skills) since you get printed-out tickers per mail, you have to do that 5 days in advance.  If you are only going to Kyoto (not any other long distance trips) consider the Japanican e-voucher. I think 21600 yen for a Tokyo-Kyoto roundtrip with Nozomi, unreserved."

I would just pay the extra 3000 yen for the Nozomi Shinkansen and save yourself 1.5 hours. If you are on a really tight budget and you arrive at Narita, and can't change your airfare so you land at Kansai Airport, then either fly with Peach or Jetstar Japan, or take an overnight bus.

There is a Tokyo Disney crowd calendar, google that.  I'm not a huge Disney fan but looooved DisneySea. Haven't been to Tokyo Disneyland though so cannot compare to Eurodisney. But if you were to go to Disney, do Disneysea only.  Suggestions for Tokyo: Asakusa with Sensoji, Harajuku with Meiji, one tall building/tower, Shinjuku/Shibuya at night, wander through Inokashira park after Ghibli and explore Kichijojo.

Incidentally the price of both tickets in Japan is pretty close to what a park hopper costs for Disney in California.  The park entrances are actually quite far apart (I think it's a ~20-30min walk or you can take the train)."

JapanTravel,369u5s,Iskuri,1 point,Sun May 17 19:47:22 2015 UTC,Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea are both fucking amazing. It's definitely worth the time. That's all I can say really.
JapanTravel,369u5s,Tw1987,2,Sun May 17 22:06:49 2015 UTC,Have you been to other Disney Parks? We were considering going to Disneyland in Tokyo but we are from Los Angeles and been to Disneyland here many times. Also we went to Magic Kingdom in Florida and were surprised how similar it was. Would not like to go to Disneyland if it matches the other 2 the same.  Disney Sea sounds interesting can you explain it briefly some of the main attraction and such?
JapanTravel,369u5s,Iskuri,1 point,Mon May 18 12:38:08 2015 UTC,"I have only been to Disneyland Paris aside from the Tokyo ones. I feel like the one in Paris is bigger but the one in Tokyo has a much nicer atmosphere. Aside from that they are very similar in structure. As for Disneysea, it's absolutely lovely and really nice just to be in. You walk in and you can go to a Venice section where you can ride a gondola, a volcano section, a little mermaid section, a '40s America section and an adventure section. There's lots of scary rides but I mainly stuck with the relaxed ones. It basically feels like a more adult Disneyland."
JapanTravel,369u5s,Tw1987,2,Mon May 18 13:03:01 2015 UTC,Cool and thanks! I think we are leaning toward Disney Sea since we only have time for 1. Hopefully we will be able to see most of it in 1 day.

JapanTravel,369u5s,Iskuri,1 point,Mon May 18 14:10:44 2015 UTC,Well we went to the hotel Karakara. It's a really nice hotel and has onsen as well. They let you walk around in a yukata and the only downsides are really the bathrooms being a bit shoddy and the constant tremors.
JapanTravel,369u5s,Tw1987,2,Mon May 18 14:12:22 2015 UTC,We are looking for an onsen for sure. I wish we were going in winter/early spring to get the full experience of the hot/cold contrast - but oh well - there is always next time for that experience.
JapanTravel,369u5s,Iskuri,1 point,Mon May 18 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"If you want Onsen, a recommendation from me would be a ""theme park"" style onsen place in Tokyo I think called Oedo Onsen Monogatari. It's like an indoor place where you walk around a feudal Japan style town, with Onsen and drinks and stuff to do. They also have themes, like when we went it was based on the anime Gin Tama."

DisneySea on the other hand, is quite different from any other Disney park and worth a visit. It has many original rides and some of the best shows I have ever seen at a theme park (assuming the weather is good)."

My main reason for not going? I'm lucky enough to live near the US Disney parks, so I can visit any time. I'm travelling 1/2 across the world to visit 'Japan', why experience something very similar to what I have at home? The Tokyo parks are more or less ""Top-Tier"" Disney parks from what it sounds like, but at the end of the day, it's still a ""Disney"" experience."

You can do JR Shin-Osaka to Toyosato in 89 mins if you time it correctly. Even JR Osaka to Toyosato can be done in 105 mins without using Shinkansen.    One option for Shiga is Hikone. Hikone Castle is quite nice even though it is smaller than some of the others. The walk up to the castle is nice too and if you like gardens then the garden nearby is worth a visit.    For ryokans, are you travelling by yourself?  I would use some of the following for searching for ryokan:- http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/index.htm http://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/ http://www.japanican.com/ http://travel.rakuten.co.jp/en/    Jalan showed Ryokan Beniayu and Sugatani Onsen.

I was not in good shape (am pretty sedentary) and all the walking killed me the first few days (especially all those stairs up from the Metro or JR!). Everyone in Japan walks a lot. My son and his GF were our guides and we'd walk 6 to 8 hours a day. Many times early on I had to ask them to stop so I could catch my breath.  The good news is it got better! I became less winded, my legs got stronger, and my feet stopped hurting. We were there for 14 days ad I noticed improvement on day 4 or 5. Hang in there!"

I'm currently trying to learn a little japanese for use on the trip, and I've heard knowing too much can occasionally startle them. Is this true? I will know hiragana, a bit of kanji and hopefully a variety of useful phrases by next year (I'm already a lot of the way through hiragana but need to apply it.)  How much walking is reasonable to expect? I have reasonably good walking stamina but I'm not too sure how I'd cope in the heat and I'm unsure how fit my friend is for it. We'll both be young students by then and I'm not too sure what my financial situation will be then - I'm starting to save now."
JapanTravel,365emb,MerfAvenger,3,Mon May 18 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"The amount of walking depends on what you're planning on doing. You can easily plan trips with plenty of rest if you wanted to.  Outside of airfare and accomodations I would say anywhere from 5000jpy - 100000jpy per day is a reasonable budget for food/fun. Your typical meal can be anywhere from 500jpy to 1500 jpy.  It will not startle anyone outside of ""wow your Japanese is so good Mr MerfAvenger!"" unless you pretend to not know any Japanese and then suddenly drop it on them.  However, if it's next year, and you're still going through hiragana, I can guarantee you won't be literate enough to breeze through, but you should definitely be able to communicate your level of illiteracy enough or at a basic enough level so they can help you better."

You would probably use it more as a tourist visiting for a short time. Additionally, it just represents the Japanese spelling of an English (foreign) word so there's no need to learn a bunch of vocabulary, so long as you can reason out some of the roundabout pronunciations. Also, if you already know hiragana you can pick up katakana quicker, a lot of the characters are similar."

JapanTravel,365emb,sickcunt69,1 point,Sat May 16 19:54:26 2015 UTC,I can definitely make that and I suppose we can plan around what my friend is capable of doing. Thank you for your help!
JapanTravel,365emb,greenboxer,1 point,Mon May 18 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your tips! So grateful for them. I'm going to travel to Japan next week and staying there for about 16 days solo and it's my first time travelling internationally.  I was worried about a lot of things you mentioned. Now I'm a bit at ease!! Thanks :)   I plan on getting the 7 day JR pass and won't be using it until 7 days after I leave tokyo to head to Kyoto. I plan on getting the suica and pasmo cards as soon as I land in haneda if I can get them there. Should I deposit about 10000 yen on each just to be safe?  About the pocket wifi, I see the one you suggested is very popular on this thread and the prices are kinda pricey. I've checked with other pocket wifi companies and what do you think about Sakura Mobile?  For Sakura mobile pocket wifi 5gb is about 4,800 yen whereas other companies are way over 7,000+yen for unlimited data. I'm confident that I won't use over 5gb since I'm only staying there for 16 days but I'm still worried that I should just get unlimited and pay the extra costs just in case I need the extra data?   Once again, thanks for your tips!! :)"
JapanTravel,365emb,ShiningJade,2,Mon May 18 14:36:55 2015 UTC,I plan on getting the suica and pasmo cards as soon as I land in haneda     No need to get both; one or the other is fine as they are almost fully interchangeable. I usually put 3000-5000 yen on each card since I use them to pay for purchases in the convenience stores to avoid receiving and using small change. Keeping the suica or pasmo in a card case is a good practice; I lost two cards before I started doing that.   No need to remove the card from the case when using it.
JapanTravel,365emb,HighbeamsNButtocks,1 point,Sat May 16 16:41:23 2015 UTC,Oh I thought only certain trains take suica and others take pasmo. That's good to know. Ill be sure to bring a cardcase. Thank you!!
JapanTravel,365emb,HeadBrainiac,2,Sat May 16 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"Here's a guide on IC cards in Japan http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html  If your wallet doesn't have an RF foil, then you can literally just leave it in your wallet and tap it on the IC pads."
JapanTravel,365emb,ShiningJade,1 point,Sat May 16 20:31:00 2015 UTC,"Hey man mind if i ask you a few questions about the passes. From what i understood in that a JR pass should be enough for me to do my travelling around tokyo via bus and trains. But what i dont know is, is it enough to travel to osaka and to kyoto afterwards plus do all the traveling in those areas? Do i need more cardd. Whats the difference between the JR pass, PASMO and SUICO?."
JapanTravel,365emb,HeadBrainiac,2,Sat May 16 21:03:35 2015 UTC,"I've actually  never used the JR rail pass before, but from my understanding it's a pass available to foreigners (so you'll need to present your passport to receive it) and it's good for a specific amount of time (around 2 weeks). You can't buy a ""3 day pass"" or whatever, only the length of times they offer (according to the website it's sold in 1 week increments and even the longest pass is ~230 USD/week) Do some math and see if you're even going to do this much travelling, usually I only spend around ~3000-5000 JPY/week for local travel when I go.  There is very little practical difference between Suica/Passmo/Icoca/ETC, they're all IC cards and should have full compatability between each other in terms of what lines you can ride. If you run out of money, most stations have a recharge station near the exit where (where I think, but I don't exactly remember) you can charge any card (it should have a logo of supported cards though).  The JR rail website should have a list of transit options available (http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html). Basically it's my understanding that you can use the JR Shinkansen, trains, busses and ferries. With some small exceptions.  If you're traveling between Tokyo and Osaka/Kyoto you should be fine since JR-west services that area. (I'm actually not too familiar with the transit in that area since I've never been).  However, in Tokyo, If you wanted to take for example Tokyo metro (for convenience), you CANNOT use the JR rail pass and would need to either buy a ticket or use any supported IC card. If you  wanted to go from Kitasenju Station to Akihabara Station, it's 200JPY, 12 minutes and 6 stops on the Hibiya line (Tokyo Metro), however with JR rail only (and I'm doing a little guess work), You would have to take the JR Joban line to Ueno station then take the JR Yamanote line for 8 stops 18min + time for changing lines and it'll cost a little bit more. Or it might not make a difference if you're just going from Kitasenju to Ueno.   Basically, if you want to save some money, do a little google-mapsings and figure out if you can do your entire trip using JR railways only. http://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/travel-information/routemap/pdf/map_kansai.pdf https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/info/map_a4ol.pdf"

JapanTravel,365emb,misterwin2221,1 point,Sat May 16 20:20:54 2015 UTC,If you can trust yourself with ¥10000 on your card then it's fine. You will most likely be able to spend it through convenience stores or if you have some left over at the end of the trip I think there's a way of having the balance + ¥500 for the card returned back to you in cash. We could figure out how to do it though so we just gave the cards to our friend.   As for Sakura mobile - I haven't heard about them. Read up on them before you go as you may get what you pay for. Importantly check into which carrier they piggyback off. The coverage could be an issue.
JapanTravel,368gl4,sashei,-1,Sun May 17 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Kamikochi and the onsens around it can fill a day or two easily if that's your thing.

JapanTravel,367n9q,KeizoKun,3,Sat May 16 23:19:50 2015 UTC,Have you booked your flights? What dates? Which airports do you fly into and out of? Depending on dates I might even consider Kyoto first before Tokyo. I would definitely spend the time in Kyoto rather than Osaka given your friends.    Kyoto and Osaka are only roughly 30 mins apart anyway so it is easy enough to day trip from one to the other. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2363.html?aFROM=2157_2158    Kyoto just provides a better contrast to Tokyo for the first time visitor. Osaka is a lot more like Tokyo.    Depending on your dates you may be there for the tail end of autumn colours:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3953.html Or you may be there for Hanatoro in Arashiyama:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3943.html    Other places I would consider as day trips from Kyoto include Himeji Castle http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3501.html Nara for Todaiji and the deer:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2165.html Hiroshima/Miyajima:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2160.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html
JapanTravel,367n9q,david_131,2,Sun May 17 02:54:08 2015 UTC,Why not a few days in Kyoto and then a few days in Osaka? And whomever wants to jump over to the other can just take their own day trip.
JapanTravel,367n9q,Osulagh,2,Sat May 16 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"So I'm finishing up 20 days in Japan right now. I chose to stay in Kyoto thinking I'd just make day trips around from there.   Despite having booked 5-6 days in Kyoto I spent 3 nights in Osaka lol.  Osaka has a great nightlife, love the bars and food there. Namba is great for bars and street food (moon tower was my favorite bar; mostly for foreigners so I met ppl from all over). Umeda has the gay bars if any of you are into that.  If you stay in Kyoto I stayed at K's House. I don't know your life, but I strongly recommend hostels, and more strongly recommend this one. Met a lot of good people there and close to a station for getting around.  I will second the suggestion that temples can get a but repetitive, but there's some other stuff around if you look in Kyoto. GEAR was this pretty cool modern performance thing that you can google 'gear kyoto'. And there are some mountains nearby to hike.  Behind the silver temple is a short hike (maybe 1 hr) up daimonjiyama that provides a beautiful view of the sun setting over Kyoto for example.  Had I it to do again, I'd sleep in Osaka and day trip to Kyoto and Nara. In general it took me ~1 hr 15 mins to get from where I was in Osaka to where I slept in Kyoto.... So keep in mind not everywhere is the 30 mins that the other guy mentioned... Maybe using shinkansen, I didn't have a JR pass so I  didn't usually look into them, though I noticed one night it was the same time either way since I had to wait a long time for the shinkansen.  Also Osaka is closer to Koya-san, and the airport (domestic flights sooooo cheap with jetstar/peach/etc.)  TL;DR: Sleep in Osaka. Day trip to Kyoto/temples as desired."
JapanTravel,367n9q,magus0991,2,Sun May 17 12:15:01 2015 UTC,This is what im planning to do Osaka > Tokyo. We love cities like New York so we think the cities are whats gonna make us love japan. However we left 2 days open for a ryokan in Kyoto in between Osaka and Tokyo.

JapanTravel,364nlu,geekpondering,3,Sat May 16 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"Read the sidebar, the mega-threads, and search around.   I have no idea what the numbers you're speaking of mean.   If you're trying to go cheap, take night buses, and stay in hostels or capsule hotels. The cheaper hostel accommodations mean that you're sleeping in bunks with other people. It can be loud, annoying, and crowded, but it's cheap and there's a roof and a pad under you. Showers, laundry, ect. can be extra at hostels. Some capsule hotels have early-booking discounts (like 9hours in Kyoto), though they typically aren't a joy to sleep in. Book as early as you have you trip down because the cheaper/nicer accommodations in Japan book up quick.   The typical 1-2 week itenarary for Japan is half in Tokyo, the other half in Osaka/Kyoto, maybe a day or two in somewhere like Hiroshima."
JapanTravel,363wmk,Zummy20,4,Fri May 15 22:13:54 2015 UTC,I really loved Fukuoka and I'll always recommend it.

JapanTravel,363wmk,Hlaoroo,1 point,Sat May 16 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"Fukuoka had a nice blend of city size and rural. Obviously it is a big city, but it didn't feel as big as Tokyo. Things weren't terribly expensive either. The public transportation was good as well as clean. You aren't too far from other cities that offer so many other things to do. They have a great river maker that has tons and tons of little food carts. The university is gorgeous. Downtown Tenjin is just amazing.   The only place I liked better was Sendai."
JapanTravel,363wmk,thened,1 point,Sat May 16 00:55:08 2015 UTC,The biggest thing that makes Fukuoka attractive as a place to study Japanese is the fact it is very easy to have an active social life here. Most young people spend their time around the Tenjin area and it is quite affordable to live near there so once you make some friends it is easy to meet up with them. Fukuoka also has a younger population compared to other cities in Japan so you will be able to meet a lot more people in your age group.  I have lived in other cities in Japan but I think if you are looking to study Japanese and have fun it is hard to beat Fukuoka when it comes to the cost of living and opportunities to make friends.

JapanTravel,363wmk,digitalturtle,2,Sat May 16 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"Lived in Nagoya for a year and it was okay. Despite being the 4th largest city, it's nothing to write home about.  Sapporo is great for the ramen alleys and the off the charts snow festival every winter. Also there are good ski/snowboarding resorts nearby if you're into that sort of thing. But it's a long ways from the main attractions of Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, etc.) so it'll be difficult to experience the more traditional side of Japan.  Kyoto is just an amazing place. The more time you spend there, the more of a gem it becomes. There are temples everywhere and it certainly has a charm to it. Plus it's not too far from Osaka if you want a more city vibe once in awhile. It's also right in the center of Tokyo on the east and Kyushu on the west so most of Japan is fairly accessible.  Can't say much about Fukuoka other than that I know people who lived there love it. Also an excellent ramen region :) The island of Kyushu is also famous for its many hot spring towns, which are also quite amazing. It suffers from a similar weakness to Sapporo in that being at the southern tip of Japan, the more main attractions of Japan can be difficult to get to (especially trekking all the way to Tokyo even via bullet train). It's not as remote as Sapporo, though."
JapanTravel,363wmk,SlimePrime,1 point,Sat May 16 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"Kyoto is an amazing city to explore and absolutely lovely to live in! I studied abroad there for a year and dream of going back. I wholeheartedly recommend it.   I currently live in Nagoya as an English teacher and I hate it. It's very industrial with lots of factories and tons of highways. It's loud and smoky, and although there are some good shopping malls, there's not much in the way of sightseeing. Nagoya is known among Japanese people as having a very ""closed off culture"" which means they tend to be less open/friendly than people in other cities (this is a generalization, obviously doesn't apply to everyone but after having lived and travelled to many other places in Japan it definitely feels like a significant difference). If you have the option of 3 other places, I wouldn't suggest coming here.  I've only briefly travelled to Sapporo and Fukuoka but they both seemed like nice, livable cities. Keep in mind though that the winter in Sapporo is intense."

JapanTravel,362er5,Wazard,2,Fri May 15 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"I WWOOFed near Nagano about 5 years ago. I stayed on the farm for about two weeks and I had a blast! I really wanted to visit Japan but like you, couldn't afford to visit without WWOOFing. I completely think it was worth it, I didn't get to travel around as much but living and working with a family was a great experience in a different way. If you decide to do it I would suggest taking your time to decide who you will WWOOF with. I think the hosts and work can really determine whether you will have a good time or not. My hosts were amazingly friendly, kind and fun but I met other traveller's that had bad experiences with their hosts. There were definitely opportunities to practice Japanese with the hosts and with the locals."
JapanTravel,362er5,chemcait,1 point,Sat May 16 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment :) I don't care so much for traveling, but just getting to visit even just a small area would be great. Don't get me wrong, I have a small list of locations I would love to check out, but I know that's not really an option at this time. Perhaps it will be after I have my degree and move there (Oh yeah, this trip will also be to help me decide if I do want to move there. I want to, but obviously I would like to visit first).  Did any of the travelers with bad experiences tell you what was crappy about it?  As for the locals, how often did you get to go into the town or just explore the general area? Did your hosts care if you wanted to go exploring once your work was done?"
JapanTravel,362er5,chemcait,1 point,Sat May 16 22:08:19 2015 UTC,"A couple of people I met either didn't like the work they were doing or found their hosts unfriendly or didn't want to interact with them very much. I think you are fine though as long as you check out your potential hosts. Check out if they have a blog or website, read other WWOOFers reviews and get a communication going with the hosts. I think the people I met that didn't have a great time didn't really do that stuff, it was more just a convenient location for them to stay. The particular farm I worked at gave me the weekends off which I used to explore the countryside and neighboring towns. After work I would either hang out with other WWOOFers or borrow a bike and explore. A lot of times after dinner we would go to the local onsen which provided a lot of interaction with locals. People always seemed pretty curious and would try to start a conversation to learn about why you were there and what you were doing which was a really good way to practice speaking Japanese."
JapanTravel,362er5,chemcait,1 point,Sat May 16 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"so basically I should be fine as long as I read the host information carefully to get an idea of what I'll be doing, be prepare to work hard, and try to open up communication with my host?  Sounds like you had plenty of time to explore, that must have been nice. When you say neighboring towns, were they like small little village type towns, or did they have like paved roads and stop lights and stuff?  Overall your experience sounds pretty much like I expected, that's good to know. Thank you so much for answering, I really appreciate it :)"
JapanTravel,362er5,Otaku23,2,Sun May 17 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"No problem at all! Yeah, it sounds like you have a pretty good idea of what WWOOFing entails and how to go about finding the best situation for yourself.  Where I was, it was just kind of a loose network of very small little towns but it was great for exploring by bike. There were paved roads but not much else. There were some cool things right nearby though like a temple, winery and the onsen. I could take a train for a few bucks into Matsumoto which is more like a small city; has restaurants, Matsumoto castle, museums etc. And one weekend I took a bus to Kamikochi for hiking. Let me know if you have any other questions : )"
JapanTravel,362er5,zerowingangel,2,Sun May 17 01:49:09 2015 UTC,"I'm WWOOFing right now in Tochiji! I wanted somewhere relatively close to Tokyo and messaged about sixty farms. About 20 replied, but I chose this one soley off of the incredible feedback it had and have to say I'm extremely impressed. I suspect it comes much more down to what type of host family, but yes, every day has been another Japanese adventure. i don't have much time to explore on my own, but I am constantly surrounded by the language (sadly I don't speak much of it) and my hosts have a beautiful home and friends. I would suggest picking someone who has hosted people (or lots of people) before, I can see how much more smoothly it's made my stay here."
JapanTravel,362er5,zerowingangel,1 point,Sun May 17 22:27:01 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I'll definitely keep my eye on the hosts feedback. Have fun with the rest of your trip :)
JapanTravel,362er5,Causality,1 point,Sun May 17 23:30:46 2015 UTC,"I WWOOFed for about a week before studying abroad in Kyoto. It was definitely a great experience. Depending on your host you'll either practice your language a lot, but sometimes they'll want to speak english with you so you wont have that many opportunities to practice. As for fun - I think retrospectively it was. Waking up at 5-6 every day and working in the sun for a couple of hours is hard work, and depending on what you're doing it can be fun (for example I loved collecting eggs from the chickens and harvesting eggplants, but hated tilling the soil and planting seeds)."

JapanTravel,362mir,reol7x,1 point,Fri May 15 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"With a trip from Tokyo -> Kyoto and back to Tokyo, even with a day trip to Nara and Osaka, you may just BARELY break even on the 7-day JR pass. That said, you might be at a loss of only 2000-3000 yen.  We bought the JR pass knowing with our planned itinerary, we would be losing about 2500 yen each. That said, when we were there, having the pass allowed us to take several unplanned trips that would have cost more money in the end.  My advice, is that if you even think you might want to go to another city on a whim and want the peace of mind, I'd say just get the JR pass.  EDIT: You can check pricing on Hyperdia and get a preview exactly the cost from point A to point B."
JapanTravel,362mir,Heinemenusch,1 point,Mon May 18 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Nara / Kyoto / Osaka are all basically 'the same place' as far as visiting. I'd suggest a rail pass would lose you money.  I would stay in Kyoto and then take day trips to Nara, Osaka, Himeji (for the castle) and Hiroshima."

JapanTravel,360t2v,rainbow_city,7,Fri May 15 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, they will have very low expectations of you. I've had a straw thrown in when buying a liter of milk more times than I can count because they don't want to risk talking to me."
JapanTravel,360t2v,its_real_I_swear,6,Fri May 15 08:44:12 2015 UTC,"The cashier might ask you if you want a bag. Otherwise, I rarely talked to cashiers."
JapanTravel,360t2v,raincheckonreality,5,Fri May 15 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"They talk your ear off when checking out but I think it's just standard Japanese way of announcing exactly what they are doing as they are doing it. If they actually ask you something that requires an answer they catch on pretty quickly that you are a foreigner by your silence and will usually switch to english or hand gestures. So you don't have to say anything. Just look at the register display for the total (or on the calculator at smaller shops) and put the money in the money tray. Always use the money tray. Say ""arigato"" when you're done with the transaction."
JapanTravel,360t2v,xinganbaobei,1 point,Fri May 15 08:03:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't know there was a money tray rather than handing the cashier your money. Good to know, thanks!"
JapanTravel,360t2v,greenboxer,1 point,Fri May 15 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"Some places don't have a money tray, you can just place the money on the counter. Other places will have a permanent tray up on a pole.  Generally they won't say much besides announce the price of each item they're scanning (maybe) and the total ring up. If you buy something that requires heating, they'll ask if you would like it heated up (chopsticks are default given). Sometimes if you're only buying a drink they might ask if you want a bag or if tape is okay (they'll tape the barcode so people know you bought the drink and didn't... I dunno steal it or whatever)."
JapanTravel,360t2v,folderol,1 point,Sat May 16 21:40:25 2015 UTC,That's good advice but I really take objection that they talk your ear off.  Japanese typically don't want to talk to foreigners so not sure why a shop keeper would.  In my experience they say very little usually.  It's not necessarily that they don't like you but they might not want to be embarrassed by their bad English.  They are more scared to talk to you than you are of them usually.
JapanTravel,360t2v,fake_gojira,4,Fri May 15 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"Chances are they'll know by looking at you that you aren't Japanese, so they won't expect you to speak Japanese. That won't stop the cashier from going through their spiel as they wrap up your purchase, but I get the sense that they do it because it would be rude not to. Just smile and say ""arigato""."
JapanTravel,360t2v,geekpondering,3,Fri May 15 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"I think the only questions they'll ask is if you want a bag, or if you are buying a bento or something else whether you'd like it heated up. If you are buying alcohol, they'll usually instruct you to press the button on the screen confirming that you are 20 years old.  Other than that, you may not have to speak to or understand them at all, since the register will give you your grand total.  There's lots of potential for interaction at conbini, such as asking for a particular type of change, paying bills there, sending a package via kuroneko, etc.  I was in a 7-11 down the street from my apartment once, and some Aussie (I think) woman walks in asking for where the 'cash out' is, which is apparently slang for an ATM machine. I pointed her over to the ATM machine in the corner, and the Japanese clerk gave me a grateful look."
JapanTravel,360t2v,HomoSatanCommieTroll,3,Fri May 15 04:31:47 2015 UTC,"Minimal interaction is fine. In addition to what some people mentioned, you may be asked if you want waribashi (disposable chopsticks) with food items, and if you pay with a credit card, you may be asked if you want them to charge it as ikkatsubarai (one-time payment, as opposed to installments).  Etiquette-wise, if they have a little tray on the counter, you should put your money there instead of handing it to them directly. I doubt they'll get super offended if you don't, but it just makes things go smoother."
JapanTravel,360t2v,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Fri May 15 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"With the credit card option, is that a common thing to pay either one time or in installments? Or is that only with bigger purchases?"

Any Japanese you can speak will make your trip that much better however. With just a little Japanese, you'll be better off than most tourists.

JapanTravel,360n2z,HomoSatanCommieTroll,3,Fri May 15 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"""politely xenophobic, passive aggressive"" country.   I think this is accurate, but not in the way you're probably imagining it.  Japanese people are, by and large, very gracious to tourists and the chances of you having a negative encounter are fairly slim. (Being ethnically Chinese, there is some chance that you could catch a hint of anti-Chinese sentiment, however. But chances are that no one will even notice unless you're speaking Chinese, and if you're primarily using English and Japanese, you'll be seen mainly as ""American-foreign,"" which almost no one has a problem with.)  Japan loves tourists and its hospitality is second to none. It's expected that foreigners are unable to speak any Japanese (and believed that speaking English is something they must do as a courtesy to visitors), and people are pleasantly surprised when it turns out that some do, even if just a little.  The xenophobia mainly applies to foreign residents and Japanese citizens who don't ""look"" Japanese (including mixed-race citizens), who are eternally considered outsiders no matter how well they speak the language or practice the culture."

At most you will be mistaken for a local and people will speak to you in Japanese. Lots of old ladies will ask you for directions. Take advantage of the practice time and try to answer back in Japanese. They will catch on really quickly that you are not local and you might strike up an interesting conversation/make a friend through that process.

Unfortunately the two listed in Shibuya are on the other side of Shibuya station from where you want to be...  The Airport Limousine is easy to set up. You didn't say what airport you are flying into, but if it's Narita, the Airport Limousine counter is right in front of you when you exit out of customs. They should understand enough English to set up a ticket for you, and they'll tell you what bus stop to wait at on the curb outside."

Your savings would be very small if at all, and in Tokyo you want to use subways which are not covered by the pass. Having the pass will force you to use very suboptimal routes  Its very close either way though. If you don't mind going out of your way you might be able to save 20 or 30 bucks  This is for the 7 day pass. The 14 day pass is right out."

So seeing as some of the places I want to go to aren't via the Yamanote line, it's probably not worth getting a JR pass then, and just getting a round trip to Kyoto and using my Pasmo the rest of the trip. Thank you!"
JapanTravel,3624zm,ImHungryFeedMe,1 point,Fri May 15 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"I bought the 7 day pass and came out slightly ahead than if I would have just bought individual tickets. I used it for round trip from Tokyo to Kyoto, some side trips like Nara, and using the narita express for the airport. Since it was likewise price vs buying individual tickets, it gave me the convenience of unlimited use and I thought it was worth it."
JapanTravel,3624zm,cuauhtlatoatzin,0,Thu May 21 08:32:19 2015 UTC,"It would only be worth it for the trip to Kyoto, but the pass is a minimum of 7 days so you might as well extend your trip to Kyoto to take advantage of the pass and make it worth the cost. You can do the standard side trips to Osaka and Nara.   If you really only want 3 days in Kyoto,  I guess you could use the pass for your round trip to Tokyo and Kyoto, which would make up the cost, and then use your remaining days to take JR  throughout Tokyo. You'll be on the Yamanote in Harajuku,  which you can use to go to Ikebukuro, and Kichijoji is also on JR Lines. Try to stick to JR and not Toei/Metro the days the pass is valid so you don't have to pay extra.  If you're gonna get the pass though, I'd recommend taking more day trips from Tokyo/ Kyoto to make the pass more valuable.  If you only want to do 3 days in Kyoto then a more cost effective method might be to take an overnight bus each way."

JapanTravel,3624zm,RealArc,0,Fri May 15 14:39:53 2015 UTC,"A one week pass is slightly more expensive than just paying for shinkansen tickets each way, if you take a lot of local trains around Tokyo or go down to Osaka too it might just break even. You'd probably be better off just getting a far cheaper night bus to Kyoto and back.  Alternatively, you could use a Seishun 18 kippu till January 10, which may work better with your schedule, though probably about as slow as a night bus (but far cheaper if you go long distance on the other 3 days of ticket validity)."

I did the Tokyo-Kyoto roundtrip on the shinkansen between December 27 and January 3 earlier this year and it wasn't so bad. If OP does get the JR Pass, I would encourage making seat reservations the minute they get to Japan and get off the plane, at the airport or Ueno/ whatever station you switch at. Avoid traveling between  December 29-January 2 and you should be ok."

JapanTravel,3624zm,RealArc,1 point,Fri May 15 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"Make your seat reservations regardless. Kyoto - Tokyo shinkansen fill up fast, and you're travelling during a busy time. As long as you make the reservation your first day or two in Japan you should be good. Have a great trip!!! I'm jealous!"
JapanTravel,361i74,ollydzi,2,Fri May 15 08:44:34 2015 UTC,"My honest opinion is that you'd benefit from rethinking this.  Firstly, is there any special reason for you to go to Kobe? I don't want to do that fair city a disservice but between you and me, there's not an awful lot of interest there for a foreign tourist, especially when your time is so short anyway.  We all like to do things differently of course but with such a short trip, I feel that spending most of the time in big cities such as Kobe Osaka & Tokyo and just a day and a half in Kyoto, you're not going to have time to see much of that lovely traditional city.  In your place, I'd forget Kobe and just go straight to Kyoto from KIX. Do a day trip from there to Osaka and then your Tokyo section at the end.  I'm guessing that budget's an issue, hence the choice of a bus from Kyoto to Tokyo but an 8 hour bus journey's going to be a big dent in your time, compared with 2.5 hours on the shinkansen.  Whatever you decide, I'm sure you'll have a great trip!"
JapanTravel,361i74,Bob_Slefty,1 point,Fri May 15 10:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!   Well, my 2nd plan is to just spend my whole week nearby Osaka,  finding a place to live for a week via AirBnB in Osaka. Then, I could make day trips to nearby cities. I'm sure Osaka and Kyoto are more Urban places I could visit that would have bars, clubs, general nightlife and city life things i could experience.  Then, I feel like day trips to Kobe, or Nara may have a more suburban/rural feel to them.  In the end, I would just forget about Tokyo. I'm not sure what the differences are between Tokyo and Osaka besides size scale, but I'd imagine that I would find both of them interesting in terms of what they have to offer.  I have a potential $1000 to spend over a week, so I suppose I could take the express train to Tokyo for $100 one way, but if I don't want to have unnecessary expenses :) If I could take a overnight bus and just sleep on the bus between Osaka and Tokyo, that would probably be a more economic option."
JapanTravel,361i74,rainbow_city,1 point,Fri May 15 11:03:50 2015 UTC,"Kobe's population: 1.54 million. Kyoto's population: 1.47 million.  Also, Kobe has been greatly rebuilt after the Hanshin earthquake, and has nowhere the amount of older buildings that Kyoto has.  And, you're not really going to get  that small city feel, say like you would, in Nara (population: 366 thousand).  Though, as mentioned, Kobe in and of itself is a nice city, but if you want to add something outside of the Osaka-Kyoto-Nara trifecta, I'd recommend Himeji castle.  It's the most historically authentic castle in Japan and has been recently renovated using only historical methods.  The old samurai housing nearby has been redone as gardens, and I loved my day there.  If you want to leave out Tokyo entirely, that's just find, but having lived in Japan for eight years, just let me say this, this is  A LOT of things different between Tokyo and Osaka."

Maybe I'll leave out Tokyo for now and visit it once I am done school in a year or so. This is my first time in Asia all together (came to Seoul, Korea about 3 months ago) but certainly not my last!  One last question. I am allergic to seafood... (well, fish oils; but I don't like the taste of shrimp, octopus, crab, etc...) Will I have a problem with finding places to eat? Korea is big on seafood but there's still a lot of pork and chicken based meals (beef as well, but that's at least a $20 meal here usually)."

Definitely look up how to say you have a fish allergy.  BUT, you can very easily find plenty of non-seafood meals.  Beef is very popular in the Osaka region, so you can find plenty of cheaper beef options."

I would spend 1-2 days more in Tokyo when you arrive just to be able to relax a bit more and get your bearings.  I'd also try to combine Osaka and Kyoto as they are right next to each other so it will be quicker to get more done while staying in that area rather than staying in Kansai twice.

I've never been to Togane but it looks like a typical small town.   You're looking for very general advice  1) If you have a bank account with a debit card you can use that to get money in Japan. The rates are generally fine  2) I guess your school should help you with customs  3) There is a supermarket down the street from your school, and if you have a furnished apartment there will be a stove. If you have an unfurnished apartment you will have to buy a stove.  4) shopping is pretty much the same as in America. put the money in the money dish instead of handing it to them.   5) clothes? tourist stuff? Japan is a modern country so you can buy things like toothbrushes  6) Great  7) Bring some kind of present for your hosts. Something from America is preferable, but something from Japan is ok too  Your train pass is probably just from your station to the school's station, so don't get to excited about that.

Osaka people are overwhelmingly down to earth and friendly, while Tokyo people tend to be a little cold. You might've just gotten unlucky in Osaka. But I do agree with you about Kyoto. Because it's such a tourist city, it has a very touristy vibe that I don't really like."

But let's be fair -- it is one of the more densely populated areas in the world, where people are often in a rush for work or some social obligation. Ultimately, I found tourists to be the worst in the ways you mention. Everyone rushing around watching their trip through a camera, never slowing down to actually experience it and take it all in.

You could skip one day in Hakone, but if you arrive late in the evening and depart early in the morning, I guess it's justifiable.

JapanTravel,35v2xs,openg123,1 point,Thu May 14 09:39:36 2015 UTC,Good to know. I only put Kobe because it was close on the map and was a recognizable name. I think we will adjust and go to Miyajima!
JapanTravel,35v2xs,david_131,2,Fri May 15 03:58:49 2015 UTC,Thanks! Is Sumo only available during that time? How much do tickets range? Is there anything we need to know before attending a sumo event/match?   All of my accommodations are booked (AirBnB).
JapanTravel,35v2xs,matrix2002,2,Thu May 14 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, Sumo is basically only available during tournaments unless you see some of the special matches or attend a training session in a Sumo Stable.

JapanTravel,35v2xs,its_real_I_swear,2,Thu May 14 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Generally, only see like one temple/shrine each in all the places you visit, with the exception of Kyoto (see as many as you can there).  You should see the stuff you like since you can't see ""everything"", it will be harder with a group of five, but you can break off into smaller groups if you want to do different things.  Especially in Tokyo, you will need to find stuff you guys like and then do that stuff. Tokyo is too big and varied.   Make a list of things you guys want to do or learn about Japan and then google them.  The only thing I would say is you need to spend a weekend in Tokyo and go to the Yoyogi park,/ Harajuku/ Ometesando/ Yoyogi National Stadium in the afternoon.  Here It's always great for people watching and they always have festivals there during the weekend.  Also, Here will help you find some events and other stuff."

JapanTravel,35ubpd,marichipini,3,Wed May 13 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"7-day pass. Most visitors won't ride JR lines inside Tokyo very much. And sometimes you don't want to. I think it's easier and more convenient to jump on other local trains rather than trying to squeeze every last bit out of a JR Pass which sometimes means having to find another train station or taking the outer loop around the city instead of just cutting across, adding to your commute time.   There is no inner Tokyo pass. You would either buy individual tickets to your destination or what most people do is get a reloadable Suica or Pasmo card for easier entrance/exit in turnstiles.   For Kyoto/Osaka/Himeji etc... there is a Kansai Thru Pass in 2 or 3 day tickets for non JR lines. Depending on where you are staying or what you are doing, you may not ride enough inner city lines to make up for the cost of the pass so I'm not sure it is worth it."
JapanTravel,35ubpd,xinganbaobei,1 point,Wed May 13 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"Which airport do you arrive and depart from? What times? Buy a Suica (or Pasmo) when you arrive. Use it in Tokyo and also in Kyoto/Osaka on non-JR transportation like the subways. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html There are a few subway passes which may be useful on specific days depending on your Tokyo itineraries. The ""Tokyo Subway Ticket"" is one option but note it does not cover JR trains (like the Yamanote Line) in Tokyo. Transportation in Tokyo:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2017.html Tokyo Subway Ticket here:- http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/value/travel/index.html    Without any pass, most tourists would spend less than 1,000 yen per day moving around Tokyo. This assumes a reasonably central hotel and a logical plan for sightseeing.    Buy the 7-day JR Pass in Norway. Exchange the voucher for the actual JR Pass when you arrive in Japan on the 23rd just make sure you specify the 26th as the activation date. You can also make your seat reservation for Tokyo-Kyoto when you make the exchange. This will save you time in the morning of the 26th. Just make sure you are back in Tokyo by the evening of the 2nd which is the last day of your JR Pass. Not sure if you have booked hotels or if you plan on spending the night in Himeji but Himeji is an easy half-day/day trip from Kyoto, so you could just spend the night in Kyoto (or Osaka). If you want to ""maximise"" the value from the JR Pass you could consider a (long) day trip from Osaka to somewhere like Hiroshima/Miyajima:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2160.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html If you want a shorter day trip then you could consider Nara with Todaiji and the deer:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2165.html  If you like gardens, or wish to see Ninjadera or the Samurai District you could also consider heading back from Osaka to Tokyo via Kanazawa and then the new Hokuriku Shinkansen on July 2nd. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2167.html    Note the rainy season:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html"

JR Sanyo Sanin? http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_sanyo_sanin.html Do you plan on seeing anything in Hiroshima? You may need to allocate time on your Miyajima day or on the 23rd perhaps. Two days seems like a lot for Nara depending on your plans? Most people would just see Nara as a single day trip from Kyoto/Osaka and not even spend the night there.     I would be inclined to see some snow and maybe consider doing the Kyoto - Kanazawa - Shirakawago - Takayama - Osaka loop. If you don't spend the night in Shirakawago (based on your Koyasan comments I suspect you would prefer not to) then spending two-four hours there would be fine. Note that there is likely to be a light up event in Shirakawago on Sat 23rd and Sun 24th although dates have not been announced yet. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5956.html http://lightup.asia/ If you plan on doing the light up you will need to book your accommodation (in Kanazawa or Takayama) well in advance and you will need to book your transport to the event long in advance also.    Depending on which JR West Pass you were thinking of, and what you end up planning on doing, you may wish to consider the national 7-day JR Pass instead.

You could also look into visiting an onsen town. If budget is an issue, try to make a day trip of it and get a guest pass, those are usually around 1000-1200 yen from what I've seen for many onsen.

If you are looking for a hostel, I recomend K's House in Kawaguhciko or Michel's Hostel in Fujiyoshida. You can keep your luggage there, they're great. Or you can keep your luggage in a coin locker at Kawaguchiko station.  If you are going to get a JR pass, train is cheaper, but you have to pay between Otsuki station to Kawaguchiko station."

JapanTravel,35tp2z,fake_gojira,1 point,Wed May 13 13:32:24 2015 UTC,what's open-jaw?
JapanTravel,35tp2z,fake_gojira,1 point,Wed May 13 13:59:16 2015 UTC,Open jaw is flying into one airport and out of another.
JapanTravel,35tp2z,fake_gojira,1 point,Wed May 13 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"ah yes...i was thinking of that too...but usually that's more expensive, no?"
JapanTravel,35tp2z,fake_gojira,1 point,Wed May 13 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"It can be more expensive, but I usually use frequent flyer miles and open jaws are the same cost in miles as a single-destination ticket. Even if it's slightly more expensive in dollars, you're still saving $150 on a Shinkansen ticket, plus a day's travel and possibly the cost of a hotel room."
JapanTravel,35tp2z,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Wed May 13 14:33:53 2015 UTC,we'll likely be getting a JR Pass...  but here's a stupid question: i see that some of the flights connect at Haneda...what happens if we don't get on the connecting flight to Osaka?  i know we'd probably be inconveniencing everyone if they have to wait for us...but is there any sort of financial or legal penalty?
JapanTravel,35tp2z,opelaceles,2,Wed May 13 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"If you're doing it on purpose to get a cheaper ticket, then the airline will probably catch you and cancel your return leg. They know that trick and take it pretty seriously."
JapanTravel,35tp2z,david_131,1 point,Wed May 13 17:03:08 2015 UTC,No as long as the airports are similar size
JapanTravel,35tp2z,ShawninOP,1 point,Wed May 13 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"It's because the Vancouver leg is a Rouge flight, as well. AC's low-cost airline."
JapanTravel,35tp2z,reol7x,1 point,Wed May 13 14:15:04 2015 UTC,How long do you plan on being in Japan? Rough dates? I would fly into Kansai. Explore Kyoto/Osaka/Nara etc. Fly from Kansai Airport to Okinawa. Explore Okinawa. Fly from Okinawa to Tokyo (Narita). Explore Tokyo. Then if you booked the return flight from Kansai Airport either just pay for the Shinkansen from Tokyo one way or fly from Tokyo back to Kansai Airport. You don't need a JR Pass with the above itinerary. Peach and Jetstar Japan both fly from Kansai/Okinawa/Narita with cheap flights. Alternatively you can often get the JAL/ANA foreigner discounts:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2364.html

JapanTravel,35t1xw,rainbow_city,2,Wed May 13 08:21:13 2015 UTC,If you only have a carry on you're fine. You won't have to pass through customs. You'll just be making an international transfer. I would recommend printing out your boarding pass ahead of time since there's probably no Hawaiian airlines transfer check in counter.
JapanTravel,35t1xw,its_real_I_swear,2,Wed May 13 10:41:18 2015 UTC,"Just to reiterate, this is if you have a carry on. If you have to go collect your luggage you're fucked."

You're gambling, in that case - if you end up missing it because you were re-clearing customs, they may still rebook. I've missed flights from my original departure airport and been able to get a re-booking, no questions asked, because the security lines were so long. It's going to differ by airline, though, I expect."

JapanTravel,35sofa,TaizerBeam,3,Wed May 13 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"InB4 people moaning about urban camping. It's bound to happen.   I'll remind you to read this: http://wikitravel.org/en/Urban_camping_in_Japan  I have yet to do my own walking trip to Japan (9 more days before I leave), but I'll try to help you:  Japan is more of a vertical country, so west to east can be a short trip depending on where you're coming and where you're going. Do you mean south to north, or do you have a specific route in mind? Most people do south to north when trying for the whole of Japan. See: This and this.   Urban camping is doable, but iffy for many. It's illegal, but depending on the circumstances you can do it and police will allow it as long as you're respectful of everything involved. Though, you might want to think of free camping outside of urban areas and staying in cheap or free accommodations inside cities. Campgrounds are rather plentiful in Japan, and as long as you bring your own tent it's like 300yen a night. Some campgrounds are in cities, on the outskirts, or just right in the forests.   There's no define routes for coast to coast in Japan (that I know of). You'll have to plan your own. But there are some routes here and there like the Nakasendo (what I'll be doing) and Tokaido routes that go from Kyoto to Tokyo, and some pilgrimages like the Shikoku Pilgrimage (which I'd love to do in a few years)."
JapanTravel,35sofa,Osulagh,1 point,Wed May 13 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Didn't know it was illegal, thought it was just frowned upon but good to know. I guess I figured east to west since someone mentioned it took a group 40 days and visas only last 90 so I figured that would be best based one time.   On the camping matter I'll be fine with doing it outside the city if it's a problem. Thanks for info and videos I'll check them out."
JapanTravel,35sofa,PlatinumMinatour,2,Wed May 13 05:56:39 2015 UTC,On the camping matter I'll be fine with doing it outside the city if it's a problem.   There's two campsites within the 23 wards (Seaside park is 300 yen/day) and a lot more outside (Japanese site).

JapanTravel,35peuh,w2g,4,Tue May 12 13:39:34 2015 UTC,"Nah there is stuff that you can do which might be worth it if it's important gear. But it will suck, because you need to put it all into a bag for a couple days and put something on it and so on... So not really doable if you're traveling.  I've seen those in SEA and my friend had some in London, it's not that uncommon.  Also you should know that bed bug bites take a few days to show, so it could be from the hostel before.  Lift up the mattress and look at the corners on the bottom, that's usually where they are."
JapanTravel,35peuh,varineq,6,Tue May 12 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Bedbugs can be very difficult to get rid of in a home. Bedbugs aren't really a health hazard, but can be mentally exhausting. A quick Google will give you a sense for what it's like. Your first priority should be making sure you do not bring them home with you.   If it were me, I'd throw away anything that wasn't super important to me. If you can't toss your stuff, I would wash everything that was in that room on the hottest temperature setting and then dry on the hottest setting. Putting stuff in a bag for a while with insecticide is a good idea too. You can google the details. Remember that they can hide in tiny crevices, so suitcases or bags have to be tossed or treated also. Don't bring anything into your house until it's been treated."

JapanTravel,35peuh,its_real_I_swear,3,Tue May 12 14:19:00 2015 UTC,If you cannot wash and dry it on the highest setting you will risk carrying them with you and potentially spreading them everywhere you spent your night at
JapanTravel,35peuh,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Tue May 12 15:06:24 2015 UTC,It might be salvageable but you usually can't machine wash sleeping bags so you'll need to find bed bug poison.

Inspecting my body, my legs are so sore now:- http://imgur.com/alCPaY1   Thought it's also worth noting I'm travelling by myself so this thread has been my only contact with people about this.   What can I do? I feel quite rightly to complain about this to someone or to the hostel.  How can a place like this be allowed to run is beside me.   I'd run a mile if I knew this was going to be the case. Genuinely cannot trust staying in a hostel again without throughly inspecting the place before sleeping in future."
JapanTravel,35peuh,emk2203,3,Tue May 12 14:05:22 2015 UTC,It's possible that the hostel doesn't know about it. Report it to them and demand your money back.

Should add: It's fine if it's one whole ""thing"" for a family, but always best for the ""things"" to be individually wrapped."
JapanTravel,35rjzg,Osulagh,1 point,Tue May 12 23:17:21 2015 UTC,Lactose free? Why? Almost everyone here drinks milk and eats yogurt anyway.
JapanTravel,35rjzg,Emnems,-1,Tue May 12 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"Majority of Japanese are lactose-intolerant (like many Asians). Intolerant, not allergic, so they can drink it and whatever problems come about is dependent on the individual."
JapanTravel,35rjzg,Osulagh,3,Wed May 13 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard this before but I don't really believe it after living here. Everyone of the kids and teachers, no exception, drink milk at lunch in all 3 of my schools. Ice Cream is also really common and most kids will say how much they love cheese."
JapanTravel,35rjzg,laryrose,-1,Wed May 13 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"Intolerant doesn't mean they can't drink milk (like a lactose allergy), but for the majority of people with lactose intolerance they can't drink too much (though this varies between individuals). A cup of milk, an ice-cream cone, and some cheese might not manifest a reaction for some folks (which oddly enough, all these contain a small amount of lactose). At a certain point, it would. Lactose intolerant also isn't a very visible problem and many people overlook the reactions. The reactions to intolerance can be anywhere from gas, bloating, or even runny poop. A lot of the symptoms people would pass off for something else. When's the last time you started investigating your diet and saw a doctor about having some soft or runny poop?   I had a friend who went on a new bulking diet of eating yogurt, milk, whey protein powder (which was a kind that had a lot of lactose), and he pretty much had explosive, spraying diarrhea for several days before consulting his doctor. After switching off and on the diet, he learned that he was lactose intolerant. He can handle several cups of milk before feeling any signs of his intolerance. I have another friend who just can't eat anything containing lactose without feeling bad.  This is all why I said preferably lactose-free. The gifts certainly don't have to be, and stuff made with lactose-containing ingredients would be at much lower risk. For example, I wouldn't bring cheese in case someone had a low tolerance to lactose (and knew it), though cookies or even chocolates would be fine."
JapanTravel,35rg04,GreyToad,3,Tue May 12 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Your mileage might vary but from my experience, it is very difficult to ""walk in"" into a hostel in Tokyo or other big cities, especially cheap or affordable ones. Not to mention, you're in a group, so it would be harder to accommodate so many people at once.   Maybe you could do it with hotels, but I have no experience with those."
JapanTravel,35rg04,EjectaFizzy,3,Tue May 12 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"How many are in your group? Four? Five? You may wish to consider looking at some Airbnb apartments that can accommodate a larger number. This may work out cheaper than hostel stays.  Depends on if you want the social aspect of hostels or not, or if you plan on getting private rooms or just dorm rooms in hostels I guess.    You could also look at some of the more Japanese style of places, like Minshukus, like Kimi Ryokan, where you can share a room relatively economically:- http://www.kimiryokan.jp/charges.html  Note also that cheap business hotels are often cheaper than some of the hostels although that probably depends on your bedding configuration, so this more applies to couples than it does to people sleeping separately.    What is your current rough itinerary? This may have some influence on where/when you can be flexible.    Note also that it is usually relatively easy to setup a ""base"" city like Tokyo or Kyoto and then if you want ""flexibility"" then you can just do different day trips from there. eg. from Kyoto you can day trip to Nara, or Osaka, or Himeji Castle, or even Hiroshima if you wish. Obviously depends on if you plan on using a JR Pass a little.    We have done the travel through Japan just booking one day in advance a few times using cheap business hotels. If you want to be flexible this is still possible, but doing so for good cheap hostels is probably going to be more difficult, depending on your exact dates and locations."
JapanTravel,35rg04,david_131,1 point,Wed May 13 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"There are 4 people in our group. I'm still in the early stages of planning the itinerary - the only thing set in stone so far is that we arrive in Tokyo. Currently looking through lists of places we want to see.  Thanks for your info, I did not know that AirBnB and Kimi Ryokan could be cheaper. I initially thought we were going to use hostels the whole time, but I see now it's not as straightforward as that."
JapanTravel,35rg04,david_131,1 point,Wed May 13 06:47:35 2015 UTC,"Cool, for four you may well find some cheaper/better options as mentioned. You could at least consider a mix of places to stay. Once you have more of an idea of what/where you want to see it will be easier to advise. Also whether you have a JR Pass or not can significantly influence things as you can be a lot more flexible with where you stay on your ""spare"" days as you can day trip from further away at no additional cost.  Maybe a combination of fixed time in Tokyo and Kyoto (or Osaka) and then a couple of flexi days may suit you."
JapanTravel,35rg04,Osulagh,2,Thu May 14 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"Japan is sort of big on booking in advance.  With hostels, I've heard of very little luck in terms of showing up and getting a bunk--let alone with a group. Best to book good hostels in advance. Though do note: All the hostels that I've looked into and booked with have a pretty good 48 hour cancellation policy. So if you plan on changing plans, plan that a few days in advance and you can scrap your reservations.  Capsule hotels and manga kissa (which will be harder with a group) are you next cheap alternatives without reservations. Though they can be more expensive and not as comfortable.  Capsule hotels aren't meant to be cheap, they're meant to be convenient. Some give you a early booking discount which can be near 50% off, include shower (with soaps), food and drink, and other amenities that hostels charge extra for."
JapanTravel,35rg04,Vagabond_Sam,2,Tue May 12 23:04:06 2015 UTC,"I did my first trip to japan like this. Wasted a lot of time getting to places and sometimes was left having to book a night or two in a business hotel.   I would reccomend booking.com and booking free cancellation properties.  you can cancel these before the 24 hour period leading to check in free of charge so it's a balance between flexibility, and pre booking.   As an example, on my last trip I was going into Sapporo from the airport, decided to stay in a Ryokan instead of a capsule hotel and change my booking on the way to the city.  Because it was the day of check in, I paid a $20 cancellation fee for the capsule hotel;, but got a Ryokan for a very similar price where I didn't have to stare my stuff in a locker during the day.   When booking just check the cancellation times and fees.   Certainly not like backpacking in EU where there is a hostel on every corner. Space is premium in Japan and hasn't built up backpacker culture to the same extent as western countries."

And this was the first week of July.   I used hostelworld.com for my bookings, they take a small upfront fee and you pay cash when you get to the hostel. Don't forget that transit in Japan is reliable, so unless you need to be so flexible as to suddenly pack up and leave Kobe for a few days in Okinawa, you should be fine to even make daytrips to most places in the area. :3"

Lake Inawashiro is quite senic as well. And the mount Bandai area is good for hiking, especially at Go Shiki Numa around the back side.   Oze is quite nice as well. It's quite far from any train lines though."
JapanTravel,35r0nq,kaseijin64,1 point,Wed May 13 02:58:31 2015 UTC,Sorry if i sound stupid but is Fukushima safe to go now?
JapanTravel,35r0nq,kaseijin64,2,Wed May 13 03:20:54 2015 UTC,A few areas near the coast around the reactor still have too high a radiation level for people to move back. Vast majority of the prefecture has radiation levels well within normal. Tokyo has higher levels then the places I mentioned.  Radiation wise I think it's perfectly safe. I would worry more about that volcano that might erupt up there then the radiation levels.   But for a short trip through I don't think you have too much to worry about. Hourly radiation levels in the largest city in Fukushima are about equivalent to eating 2 bananas. You are probably receiving at least twice that dose on the flight over.  https://xkcd.com/radiation/

JapanTravel,35q3he,AnotherCleverGuy,1 point,Tue May 12 16:12:37 2015 UTC,Probably better to ask closer to your date. Most people looking for meetups is the next few weeks.
JapanTravel,35q1cf,Faux101,2,Tue May 12 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, I have a group pretty much doing the same thing, though in June.  It will be possible, but it's going to be busy and you may have to sacrifice some places if you fall in love with a different city and want to see more.  A warning - you are going during Obon, which is a HUGE travel time in Japan.  Also, a lot of kids will be out of school in August, so places may be busy - but it's still going to be tons of fun!  Just something to keep in mind.  As for the budget. . . well, I'm from the US so there are probably differences.  My plane ticket was way higher than where your budget is, but that could be because of the location.  JR Pass is spot on.  Accommodation won't be enough unless you're couch surfing or hosteling.  Figure $35-40 USD a night on the cheap business hotel end.  Also, get reservations early due to the aforementioned busy travel season.  Food can be done if you eat cheap meals (which are still super delicious).  But a larger lunch as lunches are cheaper, then get a conbini dinner or go to a 500 yen curry/beef bowl place.  The other money will depend on what you do and how much you want to buy.  Honestly, though, I'd up your budget by a lot just to make things comfortable."
JapanTravel,35q1cf,itsavgbltpta,2,Tue May 12 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!  Yeah, the flight I'm going on is pretty bad :/ 16 hr wait time in istanbul for one... but I guess the price reflects that. Hostelling was the plan, but I'll take your advice and try and get it booked sooner rather than later.  I think we'll try and stick to what you've said for food though we might end up splurging depending on greed at the time."

I feel like the city has a convenient public transit system, and the layout is much easier to understand than some other Japanese cities. You'll also have to deal with finding and paying for parking.  That said, if you plan to leave the city and drive around the island a bit, then it's a great idea. My friends and I took a couple of days to just cruise around the western part of the island, stopping at random sites and just enjoying the contrast between the city and the rural parts."

They very well might object to the card not being in your name, especially at a hotel (where they are going to be checking your ID anyway).  You also have to keep in mind that there's a LOT of places (especially restaurants) in Japan that won't accept credit cards."
JapanTravel,35qlqj,geekpondering,2,Tue May 12 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"In the last 4~5 years, I've been asked once.  My 'signature' on the back was actually worn off, and they had me sign it on the spot (again), and then checked it against my ID.  Outside of that, my Credit Card has my 'US' name on it (never changed my name with the bank), but my drivers license (Japanese) and everything else has my 'Current' name on it."

Unsigned cards are technically invalid, and Japanese workers are known for sticking to the rules.  Also, when you use a credit card, you'll often have to sign the receipt, which is sometimes then compared to the signature on your card."
JapanTravel,35qlqj,HomoSatanCommieTroll,2,Tue May 12 21:52:20 2015 UTC,I haven't had much luck with credit cards with merchants in the first place.  They often won't take them.  When they do I don't think I've ever had them check my ID or anything.  I don't know if it's because they don't care or if they are trying to avoid potential conflicts.
JapanTravel,35qlqj,folderol,1 point,Tue May 12 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"You probably won't find yourself using your credit card often.  Japan is pretty cash heavy.  Hit up a post office or 7-11 to get cash and you'll probably be fine.  That being said, I didn't get checked the few times I did use my card to buy expensive things."
JapanTravel,35pq9f,chrishtash,1 point,Tue May 12 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"but my question is during those times would it be cheaper for me to buy one regional area around Kyoto then one for around Tokyo and to travel inbetween just taking an overnight bus?   Yes. There's no real point in getting a JR Rail Pass to just go one way between Kyoto and Tokyo. You can get 1 day bus passes and the like for Kyoto, and either just pick up an IC card (they pretty much work universally in Japan now for trains) to cover Kyoto/Osaka/Tokyo subway, or I think there's also day passes for the Tokyo Metro as well."

Reservations for all JR trains can be made from one month in advance at any JR station's midori no madoguchi, and yes the few sleeper trains left do sometimes become fully booked at some speed. If you plan to reserve using a JR pass (either for a free seat/nobinobi carpet bed on the Izumo/Seto or a large discount on one of its private cabins) there's nothing you can do but book it right away when you've exchanged your pass. If you plan to just buy normally/pay full fare, best would be to get a friend to buy it ASAP from one month in advance, (travel agencies may also offer such a service I've heard, but never investigated in detail)."

Shin-Osaka is an originating station for many of the Shinkansen so that helps in getting non-reserved seats in general.  Worst case scenario is that you just stand for part/all of the relatively short journey anyway.    Note that you can reserve as little as 15 minutes in advance on the day if you wish, depending on what the queues are like at the ticket office.

Here's the author summarizing their calligraphy teacher's explanation of the situation:   She explained that in the Meiji era, after Japan had opened up to the West, the emperor issued a decree ordering everyone to stop using the lunar calendar. It was part of the government's plan to modernize Japan by adopting Western standards. All of Japan's holidays moved up a month, to conform to the Western, solar calendar. O-bon, which until then had been celebrated in mid-August, moved up to mid-July.  ""Tokyoites went along with this because we were eager for modernity, but people in the countryside refused to switch over. Obon involves honoring the dead, and on top of that, the country folk are farmers, and the rhythm of the harvest is everything to them. Eventually, the farmers won out, and Tokyo merchants, many of whom employed people from the countryside who insisted on going back home for the holiday in August, gave up and went back to observing Obon on August 15.""   (Friedman, A., The Haiku Apprentice; page 193)  DK Eyewitness Travel Japan specifically refers to Obon being celebrated both in August and July 13-16 (p. 45), and I keep stumbling across other travel and festival guides online saying the same, usually specifically mentioning Tokyo. I guess it's just one of those things that gets repeated because everyone else says says so."
JapanTravel,35ndpb,sunshinebuns,3,Mon May 11 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"I've been there a few times. The ticket machine has no size smaller than the regular amount (which can feed a small family for a day). But all you have to do when you sit down is tell them ""men sukuname"" (麺少な目). And maybe ""yasai sukuname"". If you can't finish the whole thing, don't worry. One word of advice, if you go on a hot day, buy a drink from the vending machine while you're lined up outside the place. They only give you the most lukewarm water to drink."
JapanTravel,35ndpb,tougarashi,2,Tue May 12 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That is what I was looking for, so men sukaname is less noodles, yasai sukaname would be fewer vegetables?. I was intending on bringing water and tissues with me."
JapanTravel,35ndpb,tougarashi,2,Tue May 12 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yes to your questions. You can also say ""men to yasai sukuname de onegaishimasu"" (麺と野菜少な目でお願いします), if you want a nice, polite, single phrase to use. They're also going to ask you if you want a (literal) handful of garlic in your ramen, so be prepared for that as well."

JapanTravel,35mcq9,Heinemenusch,1 point,Mon May 11 19:03:28 2015 UTC,"First time we travelled to Japan we pre-booked the first week in Tokyo and then decided our itinerary for the second week whilst we were there.  I booked using Expedia whilst in Japan, and ended up staying at the Brighton Hotel (!) in Kyoto, near the Imperial Palace. Second time in Kyoto a couple of years later we stayed in the hotel at the railway station which was really convenient for trips to Himeji and Nara.  So perhaps that's an alternative approach?  As to Miyajima: the place is (almost) always fog bound and rainy so a bit of a gamble."
JapanTravel,35mcq9,SlimePrime,0,Mon May 18 11:42:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on season, luck, and city. I've made last minute schedule changes and have been easily able to find accomodation the same night on places like booking.com often enough, but sometimes it seems every hotel in town is full and I've had to spend the night sleeping on a manga cafe cubicle's mat. If you don't enjoy such accomodation pre-book to be safe, (if you don't mind it though go ahead)."
JapanTravel,35l5ea,vatta,2,Mon May 11 11:55:19 2015 UTC,"What's your concern? In general the transport is used to the conditions so buses and trains operate pretty well unless it is very extreme.

There are quite a few winter festivals in February including of course the Sapporo Snow Festival. http://www.japan-guide.com/event/?aMONTH=2&aYEAR=2016    If you want suggestions of places to see/consider then Zao Onsen, maybe Ginzan Onsen, Hirosaki Castle, Hakodate, Noboribetsu, Sapporo, Otaru, Asahikawa.

(I don't read much japanese.)  It was not. There was one step that doesn't appear on the explanation page. I had to ask for help at the counter, they are usually helpful and you just need to tell them the date, number of people, hour, and name.  By the way, just in case, the ""gh"" in Ghibli is pronounced ""J"" in Japan (I've discovered that recently, I've always heard a hard G in my country)."
JapanTravel,35k7ou,Gurtang,1 point,Mon May 11 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"What was the extra step?  For informations sake, your country says it wrong, as does mine, and most of the west. It is pronounced jibli, it's based on an Italian word if I remember correctly, it's some sort of portmanteau of 2 Italian words. I've always said with a hard g myself but it is actually a j in pronunciation."
JapanTravel,35k7ou,Dan_Tsukasa,0,Mon May 11 06:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well yeah I know the right pronunciation is the Japanese one since it's a Japanese company name. :p (The Italian word it comes from is actually pronounced with a hard G in Italian, which is logical since there is the ""H"".)  I didn't understand the extra step, it was easy (something like choosing between 2 buttons and entering a name) but if you can't read, you don't understand which of the buttons you have to hit.  The instructions are there : http://www.lawson.co.jp/ghibli/museum/ticket/english.html  After the last image, they just say ""7 : the slip will be printed"", but I actually had to do something else.

Note that due to the maintenance period in May (18-29), all of the tickets for May have been sold out.    Weekends will sell out before the weekdays in general. Note that the Japanese tickets have a specific timeslot and you must enter within that timeslot. The JTB (overseas) tickets have no timeslot so you can enter at any time on the allocated day.

JapanTravel,35k7ou,david_131,1 point,Mon May 11 04:16:26 2015 UTC,If you want them then I would probably just buy them using a buying service like Bridge which I mentioned above.

JapanTravel,35kmm2,RealArc,2,Mon May 11 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"There is a roundtrip discount which does not make sense for you.  One way ticket to Tokyo station should be around... 2500-3000 yen I think?  http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2430.html (How to get to Haneda airport)  Well, Tokyo Station itself is a huge, confusing maze. It's situated in a business district, so a fairly sterile enviroment. But Tokyo Station has the Ramen street, a character street, the Marunouchi side of Tokyo station is really beautiful and the Yaesu side has this underground shopping mall with lots of restaurants. You could also go to Daimaru nearby Tokyo Station and go to the depachika there.  Shinjuku (East exit) is probably what people picture when thinking about Tokyo. Neon lights, billboards, crowds... It's more lively than Tokyo station for sure.  Shibuya, too, is the modern Tokyo. With the famous crossing, many shops, and numerous restaurants.   It all depends on your tastes. Maybe for convenience's sake eat ramen at the Tokyo station ramen street, pick up some sushi in Daimaru to eat while sitting in the airport.  That said, Haneda is a really nice airport with suprisingly good restaurants (imo)."

You save monies but then you can also enjoy a private onsen! I would also recommend staying at a ryokan with an onsen elsewhere and staying closer to central Kyoto if you plan on touring Kyoto.  We stayed at:   Senkyoro - Hakone (Wonderful service! Recommend staying in the main building if you can. I would also argue beautiful scenery but it was rainy/misty the entire time we were there.) Momijiya - Kyoto (An older ryokan that's ~50 mins outside central Kyoto. Beautiful scenery.) Konansou - Kawaguchiko/Mt Fuji area (Probably the nicest rooms, very romantic!)   Also book early for the ryokans! We were limited to spending $$$ because we booked 1 mo out for April and there were such limited vacancies. (We were even only planning on just one ryokan but then we ended up booking two more just because all hotels and hostels had limited vacancies.)  [edit] We used Japanese Guest Houses, Japanican, Agoda and TripAdvisor to search ryokans for forever. Oh also this site!"
JapanTravel,35jpau,knots23,1 point,Mon May 11 04:28:14 2015 UTC,I just booked 3 nights at momijiya for my trip in June! What did you think of it? Any advice for someone going to Japan got the first time and staying at a ryokan? I'm hoping that stay will be the highlight of our trip :)
JapanTravel,35jpau,curiouscretin,1 point,Mon May 11 06:49:17 2015 UTC,"The staff was all super friendly! They provided a shuttle bus to/from JR Hanazono Station which was really convenient. And it's not just pick-up/drop-off on your check-in/check-out. It's available every day (your choice to leave from hotel 9:20 or 10:20, and then pickup like 15:30, 16:30, 17:30) so we were able to get to Kyoto and Arashiyama really easily.  It is an older ryokan. But beautiful. I think it was nice for us to have had Senkyoro in Hakone first because they gave a lot more advice for first timers in a ryokan (like how to put on your yukata). I didn't notice as much for the other ryokans, but it might've been because we were comfortable by that point. (We stayed 3 nights at each place.)  Basically-- you arrive, you check in, they ask you when you want dinner (in the restaurant-- the other ryokans we stayed at we had dinner in the room), they take you to your room and give you a hot towel/tea/snack, you change into the yukata and chill out till dinner time (you pick from 2 or 3 options... I think it was 17:00 or 18:00). Dinner is traditional in that you have several courses (appetizers, soup, sashimi, simmered course, grilled course, entree, fried course, special dish, soup again, dessert). It's mostly served in clusters-- not one at a time. Their menu doesn't translate as clearly, so you won't know what you're eating haha. It's a very cool experience. Breakfast is also Japanese breakfast. They have the public open air baths (men & women are separate) and then also 2 private open air baths. We tried out both private baths. Beautiful view of the mountains at day and at night! Someone accompanies you up to the bathhouse and shows you exactly what to do. Few of the staff's English is really good, but for the most part it's ~ehhh okay/you'll survive. We had some trouble asking more detailed questions. Overall, very enjoyable! :) /novel (sorry!)"

JapanTravel,35jxhq,kamikazi02,1 point,Mon May 11 11:23:05 2015 UTC,Your itinerary also seems like you'll be immensely busy.  Have you looked up shinkansen times to see how long it will take for you to get from point A to B?  Keep in mind that you can't take the fastest shinkansen on the JR pass.  Owakudani in Hakone is currently closed due to increased volcanic and seismic activity.  You may want to look at an alternative plan.
JapanTravel,35jxhq,Kalik2015,0,Mon May 11 11:16:28 2015 UTC,"A fairly solid itinerary, if those places interest you. I've done similar routes and the timing is more than feasible, with the possible exception of exploring Himeji and Miyajima in the one day, (at best it'd be extremely rushed and you'd probably only have time for say a quick visit to Itsukushima Jinja on Miyajima, it deserves a full day or 3/4).  Also note the Owakudani closure in Hakone at present. I consider it the highlight of Hakone, but others still say a visit it worth it. Personally I'd recommend replacing it with a daytrip to Kamakura, Yamadera, Kusatsu Onsen, or anything of your preference around Tokyo instead, (or can squeeze in a daytrip to an interesting place anywhere near your route too, Ise, Hiei-zan, Akiyoshido, Izumo/Matsue, Kumano (probably needs 2 days), etc)."

JapanTravel,35iw3r,iambananasfoster,2,Sun May 10 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Hi !  Cherry blossom season in late march/early april. Crowded, but can be worth it (and nice places in Japan are always pretty crowded anyways). The dates : http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2011.html  Japanese festivals : http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2063.html  I'd say that your itinerary is fine. I can, however, make a few remarks, on several points (duration of the JR Pass, destinations, time to rest, etc.), for optimization's sake : you can feel free to disregard them.  First, a few things about Kurokawa onsen. It IS doable, so as I said, you can completely disregard my remarks if you really want to go there.  However : it's really far from Tokyo, it extends your trip in a way that makes you ""waste"" full days in the Shinkansen. You could maybe find a pretty similar experience in other onsen resorts closer to the main axis Tokyo/Kyoto. Check onsen towns on japan-guide, for instance. I've also been to ""Takaragawa Onsen"" which has a ryokan (Osenkaku) that has several big outdoor baths along a wild river (mixed gender except for one). Pretty awesome. I think most of the onsen in Kurokawa are gender separated (maybe that's what you prefer, however it also means you're not with your boyfriend).  If you're still intent on going there, you could spend one less day (arrive one day, enjoy onsen there in the evening, then enjoy more onsen the next ""full"" day, and leave on the third day). That way, you could make it in a 14-day JR pass that would include your Narita-Kamakura ride on the first day (if you stick to your current schedule).  Finding an onsen resort that could be hit between Tokyo/Kyoto, or as a fast-paced 2-day trip only from Tokyo or Kyoto, could allow you to do more things around Kyoto (Nara, Osaka, Himeji...).  That takes me to the ""JR pass duration"" : a 21-day pass in a 20 day trip seems like a waste, considering that there are many things to see in Tokyo and as side trips that are not necessarily covered by the pass (Fuji 5 lakes area, Nikko...).  One last thing : do you really need to get to Kamakura first ? I always advise spending a few days in Tokyo first in order to get rid of the jetlag. Besides, Kamakura can be done as a day trip from Tokyo."
JapanTravel,35iw3r,Gurtang,1 point,Mon May 11 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the advice!  I've been really excited about visiting onsen in Japan for awhile now, but did find it pretty difficult to choose a place. I agree that Kurokawa is quite difficult to get to (including--on the route I found--a bus that runs only twice a day). I had seen Takaragawa Onsen mentioned a few times on here, but I think the thing that put me off to it was that when I look on japaneseguesthouses.com, there is only one ryokan listed. Is that true? Is it just the one ryokan, not a town of multiple ryokan with their own onsen? That would be risky for me, since we have a special meal request (celiac, but my bf is also vegetarian), so if they can't accommodate us, we'd have to rethink our whole schedule. That's also why I ruled out Kinosaki Onsen--japaneseguesthouses has a note saying that none of the ryokan in the area will make meal changes, and not to stay there if you have allergies.  That's also one of the reasons we decided to first to go Kamakura. We plan to book primarily in ryokan via japaneseguesthouses (everywhere except Tokyo) so they can explain our dietary restrictions beforehand to the ryokan and I can hopefully not get sick (I have read that it's very difficult to eat gluten free in Japan). Then we'd be able to have a prepared meal in the evening when we get there rather than immediately having to mess around with trying to read labels in Tokyo (and possibly getting sick right at the beginning of the trip).   The second reason we thought we'd go to Kamakura first is that we thought the more fast-paced Tokyo would actually be better enjoyed without jetlag. Is there a reason it's better to get over jetlag in Tokyo?  That is a very good point about the JR pass. I was thinking we could still use it in Tokyo on the Yamanote line, and for the N'EX back to the airport, but it seems those things are not very expensive to buy individually. I am just finding it very difficult to cut any days out :D  Thanks, you've given me a lot to think about! I'm also leaning toward spring--I know things will be busy, but if we're already planning now, we should at least be able to book early ;-)"
JapanTravel,35iw3r,Gurtang,1 point,Mon May 11 07:07:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, if you have dietary restrictions I must admit  I can't be of much help. I did a rapid google search and there seems to be several useful websites with lists of restaurants and shops, and a ""Japanese Celiac card"" to print out in advance and show Japanese people. I guess you know more about that than me. :)  I will try answering the rest of your specific questions.  Yes, there is only one Ryokan in Takaragawa onsen. It's part of a bigger onsen area, Minakami, but it's not an onsen town like Kusatsu or Kinosaki.  Check here maybe ? http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2292_where.html  About jet-lag I admit it now seems unimportant, compared to the meal concern. The main thing is to stay busy as late as you can on the first days without crashing (and then waking up in the middle of the night), so you can do that anywhere. It just is easier when you are in one spot for 2 or 3 days, where if you really are beat you can go home, take an 1 or 2 hours nap, freshen up, etc. More difficult to do that when you are out in the country, switching hotels, riding on trains, where you risk falling asleep and then spending the rest of the day not quite awake.  JR pass : the Yamanote line is not very expensive and you'll probably use metro lines too, so it doesn't really come into the equation. However the N'EX is pretty expensive (at least 3000 yen one-way).   That makes me think that I forgot a big advice : if you can, use Haneda airport ! A lot closer than Narita, especially if you want to go straight to Kamakura (Narita is pretty much at the exact opposite from Kamakura)."
JapanTravel,35iw3r,yamaume,2,Mon May 11 08:28:09 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love Kurokawa Onsen. I just recommended it on another thread.  It is out of the way and I would consider cutting other things to add it in.   I always go to gender-separated baths with my husband. We just say goodbye and see you in an hour, take baths separately, then meet up again after the hour has passed. Onsen have lounging areas so groups of mixed gender can meet up again, talk, eat, and relax after the bath.  If it is not practical then the Hakone area near to Tokyo is great and can be done as an overnight trip from Tokyo.  I agree Kamakura is a good day trip from Tokyo as well.  You can check this website to see when sakura will start to bloom  http://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/index.php  It always takes a few days for them to go into full bloom.

Was it easy to take the bus, or did you have to wait a long time? That is the main thing I'm worried about, that those days will turn into forever-travel days (which is why I planned two full days in town).   Thanks for the map, too!! Really helpful :-)"
JapanTravel,35iw3r,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 07:24:08 2015 UTC,"No problem!   Japanese people are quite serious about cherry blossoms. Every year people calculate exactly when the best time is to go. Full bloom is considered the best, but some people like to go a day or so after full bloom, because the petals look like snow when they fall.   About Kurokawa Onsen, I went by car last time because my friend drove. It looks like if you go by bus it is 2.5 hrs from Kumamoto station. If I get to go back I'll go by bus because I don't have a license right now. I think your plan looks good and you will be so relaxed by the time you leave Kurokawa.  http://www.kurokawaonsen.or.jp/eng_new/access/  I am vegetarian too actually. Japanese are either not prone to Celiac Disease or it is not well-known and not diagnosed.

They all have a nice wide paved path running alongside them, and they aren't very crowded at all.  Yoyogi park is very nice to run, but maybe not as convenient since you might have to take a train.  I also like jogging along beside train lines for some reason, as they tend to beside small roads with residential homes/small shops without much traffic, and you get to see a lot of regular Japanese life taking place.  Also, very easy to get back to where you started when you run beside a train line for obvious reasons.  If you want to see a whole lot of runners, go do the circuit around the imperial palace.  It'll be very busy as it is extremely popular.  Some details: http://slism.com/diet/tokyo-imperial-palace-jogging.html  I don't think you have to worry about safety in any part of Japan, at any time.  I've gone running at pretty much every time of the day, 5am to midnight, without any problems.  If you're going for a long run, I'd bring a phone with GPS and water.

Also, in the same area is the Meiji shrine, a neat place to check out.   Hokkaido is pretty different from the Tokyo area, and just about everywhere we went had plenty of places to run and enjoy some beautiful scenery. It was there I actually went on a run myself  (can't remember where exactly, but it was somewhere near Yubari) and the only issue I had was that it started raining before I got back to the hostel!   Japan, from my experience, is incredibly safe.

If you plan on running at night, be sure to wear light clothing or have reflectors on.  Staying in Shinjuku, you can definitely do the imperial palace run.  It's 5k around the palace and many people run there.  Depending on where you are in Shinjuku, it will be about 5k to get there so 10k total.    If you don't mind paying an entrance fee (200 yen), Shinjuku Gyoen is also an option although they are only open between 9am and 4pm.  Meiji Jingu Gaien is also really pretty and easy to run.

I do run with a partner when I do trail running just in case I get injured/lost or run into someone creepy.  The mountains of Hokkaido have bears but you won't need to worry about that in the city.  The things you want to take sound great. I would also take a little money, just in case. You might see something interesting you want to buy or want to get a bottled drink anyway.  As somebody pointed out you are technically supposed to have your passport, but if you are stopped you can show them the hotel card and go back with the police to the hotel to get your i.d. to show them.   I don't personally bother with a poncho for rainy runs since I figure I'll just shower later. I would go for wicking fabrics over, say, a cotton t-shirt.

JapanTravel,35jh2t,nomusicnolife,1 point,Mon May 11 00:09:07 2015 UTC,"Hello,   Please note the open season for climbing Fuji is July 1-Sept 14 this year. Only experienced climbers with specialized gear can climb it outside of this period. Two nights is enough to stay in Fuji Yoshida, I think. Typically people take a bus to the fifth station halfway up the mountain, then climb up most of the way, stay in a mountain hut and sleep for a few hours, wake up to make it to the top and see the sunrise, and then climb down.  It is possible to do this without sleeping in a mountain hut by starting earlier and in that case I think you can do it in one day if you are fit, but you will miss seeing the sunrise from the top.   Day trips from Kyoto to Osaka are easy. It takes less than an hour to get from Kyoto to Osaka. It will take you a half day or more to reach the Kyoto/Osaka area from Fuji Yoshida, though. Depends on how you are going.  My favorite place in Fuji Yoshida is Fuji-Q Highland, a really fun amusement park. I wouldn't go there after climbing Mt. Fuji though as standing in line wouldn't be fun."
JapanTravel,35jh2t,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"If you start from the fifth station via bus like 99% of climbers, it's doable during one day, quite a bit more time consuming if you start from the base (though beautiful). As others said doing a night climb to see the sunrise is also popular, just ensure you're there during climbing season.  As for a Kansai day trip, from Fujiyoshida probably not too practical due to the time involved. If you were staying on the other side of Fuji near Shin-Fuji station it might be. However daytrips between Osaka/Kyoto are of course easily doable, the Keihan line connects Osaka and all the major sites in eastern Kyoto in under an hour, and you can shinkansen to Kyoto station if you have a JR pass in a stupidly short amount of time."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,cuauhtlatoatzin,2,Sun May 10 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"No idea what you're going to do in Fukuoka that long, unless you have an itinerary for it sorted already. Wouldn't think myself that I could kill 3 full days there as a tourist, or even one.  May also want to double check the Miyazaki bus schedule depending where you're going, it's a bitch to certain places like Udo Jinja.  Would also personally highly recommend a one/two day trip to Takachiho, one of the most incredible places I've seen in the country after years of travelling. If you're around Miyazaki it's a must."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,SlimePrime,2,Sun May 10 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I'm surprised at what you said about Fukuoka. I'm really looking forward to spending some time in the city, and was actually thinking 3 days wouldn't be enough! Haha!  I figured one day would be the area around Hakata Stn, canal city, maybe check out Shofukuji, and get food and drinks in Nakasu. Another day would be Momochi Area and Fukuoka Tower, and Ohori Park. The third day would be either Dazaifu, Uminonakamichi, or exploring another part of Fukuoka.   I also really appreciate the feedback about Miyazaki. TBQH I'm not sure what I would do there, I just wanted to add another city to the itinerary since I'll have the pass. I probably wouldn't go as far out as Udo Jinja. HOWEVER I really like the idea of going to Takachiho. I'd been considering going to the gorge, but it seemed like it might be too much of a trek going from Kagoshima. I'll definitely look more into it, I might switch that out for Miyazaki.  Thanks much!!!"
JapanTravel,35i0c0,thened,2,Sun May 10 16:22:38 2015 UTC,Fukuoka nightlife is quite good and you can have a great time here. I'd be happy to show you around while you are in town. I'd suggest spending a night in Kumamoto. It is quite a nice city too and the people there are very friendly.  Fukuoka doesn't have a ton of sights to offer tourists but if you meet the locals it is very entertaining.
JapanTravel,35i0c0,doclarock,1 point,Sun May 10 17:34:38 2015 UTC,"Trip plan looks pretty good to me. Out of curiosity, why Ozu? I've been because I had an obligation there...and there ain't much going on. In Kagoshima, be aware that there's usually volcanic ash in the air, and on bad days it can make wearing contact lenses tough (if you wear contacts).  You can visit that volcano (Sakurajima) by ferry if you're looking for something to do, too."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,MericuhFuckYeah,2,Sun May 10 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"I really like ""small sleepy village"" feeling places, and Japan Guide made it seem really nice.

Thanks for the heads up!"
JapanTravel,35i0c0,MericuhFuckYeah,1 point,Mon May 11 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"Seems Alright. Kagoshima to Kumamoto to Beppu is absolutely doable in a day, the castle in Kumamoto really doesn't take long. Since you're in Kagoshima you should seriously consider taking the jet foil or ship to Yakushima. The two days there were the highlight of my three month trip in Japan and it's a shame to miss out on such an incredible place considering how close you'll be. As someone said Fukuoka really doesn't need so many days! Please please please consider Yakushima, you won't regret it."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,yamaume,1 point,Sun May 10 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I feel better about the Kagoshima-Kumamoto-Beppu trip. I really just wanna check out the castle and get food and walk around a bit, shouldn't take too much time.   I'm super interested in Yakushima, but here's the thing. Since I'm going to be traveling alone I don't feel completely comfortable doing something that would require hiking or walking around out in the woods or mountains far from other people. That's one reason I'm not too sure about Takachiho. I assume there will probably be tons of tourists at Yakushima but I don't really wanna tag along with another group. I'm definitely gonna do more research into Yakushima though, pretty much everything I read recommends it."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"The trails of Yakushima always have people on them, I did the climb to Jomonsugi through the Arakawa trail and back down through Shiratani Unsukiyo a couple days before Golden Week, and it was full with middle aged and older Japanese people. Older folks are big domestic travelers and I'm sure you'll find them all over the place. I personally traveled alone but teamed up with a few more travelers I  met in the hostel I was staying. I'm positive that you will see tons of people on the trail, October is a nice time of the year.   Honestly, it's super doable alone aswell, if 70 year old Japanese couples can do it, so can you :) I didn't go all the way to the peak but I've heard its also worth it so I would strongly consider it, I really regret not going all the way up."
JapanTravel,35i0c0,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"Fukuoka is a nice city, but Kyushu is famous for its countryside. I would take some days off of the Fukuoka itinerary and explore the countryside more. I think one day in Fukuoka is way more than enough. Fukuoka has lots of shopping, the yatai stands to eat at...and not really that much else to do that I know of. I had a low budget when I visited and I felt there was nothing I could do without knowing any locals.  I like Beppu and I absolutely love Mt. Aso and Kurokawa Onsen. If you like onsen or want to try them, you won't regret going to Kurokawa.  Trains in Kyushu are infrequent and slow so give yourself time to move around once you get out of the bigger cities like Fukuoka.   See the peace museum in Hiroshima too.   Your trip is going to be awesome; I'm pretty jealous!"
JapanTravel,35i0c0,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I'm really interested in checking out more rural and small town parts of the island, which is why I wanted to be based in Kagoshima/ Satsuma part of the island since it feels more removed from Fukuoka and all that.  I plan on doing the onsen thing in Ibusuki , but I'll definitely look into Kurokawa and Mt Aso. Mt Aso leads me to the problem I mentioned above about not wanting to do too much hiking by myself, but I could definitely do a relaxing day in Kurokawa.  I'm also gonna look for something I could do as a day trip from Fukuoka in northern Kyushu before I head down to Kagoshima. Thanks!   I also want to do a scenic train trip; my favorite thing I've ever done in Japan was take the Akamatsu KTR train in Northern Kyoto, and I'm looking for something similar to do in Kyushu. Anyone have suggestions?"
JapanTravel,35i0c0,thened,1 point,Mon May 11 12:08:23 2015 UTC,"No problem. You can take a bus straight to the top of Aso, walk around a bit just to see the views from the top, and return by bus, no hiking required. I did this because my ride dropped me off at the wrong road and I lost time walking up it and didn't have time to do the actual hike.  There are loads of interesting trains in Kyushu. http://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/train_index.jsp"
JapanTravel,35i0c0,thened,1 point,Mon May 11 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"DUDE! That list of trains is amazing!

I want to do all of them!"
JapanTravel,35iec1,arvotheaspie,3,Sun May 10 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"Plenty of tourists who cannot speak Japanese, get by just fine. No need to hire a guide imo.  Festivals... most happen during summer time (the traditional ones with fireworks I assume and people walk around in Yukata?) but not many people like the Japanese summer (and typhoons can happen during that season). Fall and Spring are high season of tourism because a) autumn leaves and mostly good weather b) Cherry blossoms and mostly good weather.  Money depends on what kind of spender you are. Hostels (dorm rooms), eating the big meal for lunch, cheapo conbini food for dinner? No shopping, using night buses, trying to get into free attractions? ►Cheapish budget.   Read Japan Guide and the sidebar on Japan Travel with a handy link to: How much I should budget. Ahem"
JapanTravel,35iec1,RealArc,1 point,Sun May 10 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to hire a guide either. I agree that most people who come can't speak Japanese and still get around, so it should be easy for you.  There are festivals at different times of year, but yes, mainly summer. Google festivals in Japan to see which ones you might be interested in.   I like summer best because of festivals, visiting the ocean, and hiking, but the humidity can be punishing so many do avoid it in favor of spring and fall. Winter is not as beautiful as other seasons in my opinion but there are still fun things to do, like snowboarding or going to onsen when snow is falling.   I came the first time for a visit when I was in college, fell in love with the country and moved here a few years after I graduated (it took some time to save enough money.)"
JapanTravel,35iec1,yamaume,1 point,Mon May 11 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"Honest to god I'm living almost the exact situation you just described. Our trip is in 10 days though, so our preparation is almost done. The only advice I have is to plan financially way in advance. I started saving last summer and I reached my goal in April. I worked on campus my school the second semester after taking a break from work the first semester. I wouldn't recommend doing it like that because the second semester I had to be extremely frugal and much of my free time went to homework or work. Decide the places you want to visit and things you want to do to start off and then base your budget around it. If you want to see multiple cities then add more to the budget etc. Good luck planning and have fun if you guys decide to go!

JapanTravel,35iec1,RAColt45,1 point,Mon May 11 08:33:25 2015 UTC,"You don't know enough yourself about what you want to do for us to be able to help efficiently. :)  If there are things you absolutely want to see, check it out on google, ask if necessary.  If you have no specific idea, Japan is so exotic to us westerners that a general touristy trip should be fine. Check out japan-guide for example.   The best times to visit are spring and autumn (fair and dry weather). Summer is very hot and humid, there is a rainy season in june and typhoons at the start and end of summer. Winter can be pretty great, it's usually fairly sunny and some landscapes are amazing when covered in snow. And there are less tourists of course.  Money depends on so many factors, including the exchange rate, that it's hard to say. Check this : http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2410.html  I'd say you can start considering a trip when you have about 40 USD to spend a day (including a night in a hostel dorm), plane tickets and transportation not included. A one-week JR pass costs 240 USD right now. Then add your plane tickets, 10 USD a day in transportation in Tokyo, and you have a low budget estimate. So I guess, for a minimum of 10 days, about 1500 USD at the low end ? (I don't know about plane prices from your coutnry.)"

Zuihoden, accessible by the Loople bus. Matsushima, on the north end of Miyagi, accessible by JR trains. Shiogama Shrine, between Sendai and Matsushima. Tashirojima (Cat Island), accessible from the port at Ishinomaki. Zao Fox Village, in Shiroishi (need a taxi to get all the way up there, which can be pricey). Shiroishi Castle is a nice place to visit, too. Aoba Matsuri - main events on May 16-17, with the big parade on Sunday. Parade floats and groups doing the sparrow dance (suzume odori) may be seen in the streets during the week leading up to it. Yamadera (Yamagata prefecture, but easily accessed from Sendai on the JR Senzan line) - beautiful mountain temple you can hike up to."

I also submitted a form to the Japanese Customs so there wouldn't be any problem bringing it in, in case my bags were searched.  It's been a few years, but I know I talked to someone at customs and just filled out a form - it wasn't a big deal.  This turned out not to be necessary, as they seldom search luggage.  But I figured  better safe than sorry."

But like shrewdster said, they most likely won't sell out every session in a week. I pre-ordered tickets for the new Attack On Titan movie last month (it's released in August) but I had to visit the actual cinema in my city to pre-order. I'm unsure as to whether you can just buy tickets on the day, but I'm pretty sure you would be able to, you would just have to get there two hours or so before you're scheduled to watch the movie to ensure you get tickets before they sell out for your viewing, but this depends on how popular the movie you want to go watch is, and also which area of Japan you're going to. I live in Okayama, so there's not going to be as many people going to the viewing here as there most likely will be in places like Tokyo."

(I live in Japan and can't even order online because of this.) My recommendation is just to arrive a few hours before the movie and buy tickets.  I went to the new Dragonball Z movie the day after it came out and got my tickets at 10am for a 6pm showing with no problems.  It might sell out if you wait until 30 mins before the movie starts to buy them, so I recommend buying them that morning or even the day before if you're able. That should be plenty of time.  As an aside, many theaters show online how many tickets have been sold per showing. (My local theater uses a blue circle for ""available"" a yellow triangle for ""limited seats remaining"" and a pink x when it's sold out. You can generally use this to help you pick when to see a movie."

JapanTravel,35erls,sexyreagan,2,Sat May 9 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"This is the sort of thing that people will say ""ask immigration,"" but that is an incredibly frustrating thing to try to do and the answers always seem to vary depending on the particular person you spoke with anyway.   In general if you are from a country that is granted automatic tourist visas in Japan then they'll give you one so you can leave the airport. Especially since you'll have a ticket with you showing you have the intention and means to leave Japan, right?  I wish I could recommend a way for you to verify everything before you leave though so your mind will be at ease. Read the websites I guess."
JapanTravel,35erls,Staggering_genius,2,Sat May 9 20:56:39 2015 UTC,Edit: forgot to mention that your original visa was cancelled when you left so they'll just stamp your passport again for a new 90 days. At least that's been my experience in the past.
JapanTravel,35erls,Staggering_genius,1 point,Sat May 9 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah, the reason I asked is because in some countries your visa lasts and you can come in and out of the country with a re-entry permit, skipping the line at the airport.  But, given what you and everyone in the thread has said, it's probably worth just trying it out. I don't want to get to stuck explaining to an immigration officer what I'm doing, but the return ticket and maybe a few key Japanese phrases (about delicious ramen!) should cover that."

If you are all over the place in regards to the airlines you choose then I would go with an Capital One or other travel rewards card. I've flown United and American to Japan for very little just based on the milage bonus given when signing up and my regular spending habits.

JapanTravel,35f8sk,digitalturtle,1 point,Sun May 10 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer ANA over JAL. Things are just a bit nicer on ANA. That being said I will fly with whomever has the best combination of fare/schedule.

JapanTravel,35f8sk,unitwhy,1 point,Sun May 10 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"It depends if you are trying to get miles by using your credit card.  If you get 1 mile per dollar spent, you still have to spend $50,000 to get enough miles for a a US-Japan economy ticket."

ANA is Star Alliance, which is the same as United Airlines.  JAL is on oneworld, which includes American Airlines.    (I'm not sure where you're from, but I'm assuming the US).    You could get credit cards through United or AA, both of which usually have good (50 to 70,000) bonus mile offers, and use the miles to book flights on the Japanese partner airlines.  I do this fairly often because it's easier to earn miles for US-based airlines, but the Japan-based airlines are nicer to fly on.  United lets you select ANA flights from their award booking website.  American I haven't used in a few years but I think I had to call an agent to book on JAL flights."

In my experience, restaurants listed there are all right, but aren't the best you could find on tabelog or a local's recommendation.

Just based on your timeframe, and being a first time trip, Kyoto/Osaka would be a better match. I'd need like 2 full weeks in Tokyo. There is a Den Den town in Osaka that is like Tokyo's Akihabara for otaku stuff. I find Den Den town easier to navigate. That's why I suggested getting your city fix in Osaka and really exploring the Kansai area. Although you probably should go to Tokyo to visit Tsukiji market since it's being relocated next year... if you care about food markets."

Personally, my memorable places in Tokyo were JS Burger, Celeb de Tomato, and Patisserie Potager.   JS Burger is just an American themed gourmet burger joint, but it's so tasty. I constantly think about and miss this place. Just peruse the menu and pick your favorite burger.  Celeb de Tomato is a restaurant where everything is made with tomato as the main ingredient. You should try the Fruits Tomato, which is a strangely sweet tomato.  Patisserie Potager is a dessert place where everything is made with vegetables. Really interesting. Flavors change every so often so get whatever you think looks interesting and enjoy."

We visited Osaka yesterday and ate at a place at the base of Osaka Tower where everything is on a stick and deep-fried. Of course I can't remember the name of it but the exterior had a lot of orange and, at one entrance (there are two), a large resin character (can't remember... maybe a chef?) holds what appears to be two corndogs. I think it was kushikaru?  We got chicken meatball, shrimp, tankatsu, okra (meh), asparagus, garlic chicken filet, quail egg, cheese, leek, shiitake. There's an optional dipping sauce.

I was thinking of getting a 3DS and some games straight from Japan, does anybody have any experience with this and will it be functional in the states?

If you lose your passport, it helps a lot if you have a copy of it (and that copy should be kept somewhere separate so you don't lose both at once).  Re: Weather  It'll be warm, sometimes hot, but not unbearably so. Since you're traveling, you'll probably be walking a lot and out in the sun, so bring clothes that breathe well and shoes that won't hurt your feet. A coat probably won't be needed for the Tokyo/Kyoto area, though maybe a light sweater will help if you'll be out after dark much.  Re: Sunscreen  It's not hard to find sunscreen in Japan. Bring it or buy it when you get there, either way it'll probably come in handy.  Re: Postcards  Yep, you can buy postcards. Loft and souvenir shops tend to have tons of nice ones.  Re: 3DS  All 3DS software is region-locked, so you can only play Japanese games on a Japanese system. However, there's no physical location check, so it'll work just as well no matter where you are.

JapanTravel,35ab8p,aioros84,4,Fri May 8 13:00:16 2015 UTC,its illegal.
JapanTravel,35ab8p,ShawninOP,4,Fri May 8 19:00:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend it. If you lived there and were using it in non-tourist areas as a mode of transportation it might be okay. But if you're visiting as a tourist/visiting touristy places it'll probably be too crowded/a nuisance.

JapanTravel,35ab8p,RealArc,2,Fri May 8 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not popular and some streets far too crowded for you to actually rollerblade...  Also, wouldn't it be a total bother to slip on resl shoes whenever you go to a shop/shrine/etc. many travel guides do say, bring easily removable shoes."
JapanTravel,35ab8p,Ichi-Guren,1 point,Fri May 8 13:14:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was wondering because i Just came back from Barcelona and everybody there is on skate or roller.
JapanTravel,35ab8p,zaikman,2,Fri May 8 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"Plus a lot of the city is hilly and built on a steep incline. I'm not sure you'd want to use skates.   Also, if you do go with the bike, there are not always good places to park it.   So both would have their downsides, but biking wouldn't be looked down on for sure."
JapanTravel,35ab8p,Ichi-Guren,1 point,Fri May 8 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Didn't thought of the ""hilly"" side, major deal breaker. Thanks"
JapanTravel,35ab8p,zaikman,1 point,Fri May 8 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"Kyoto? Hilly? Kyoto is remarkably flat, unless you're on the eastern/western fringes of the city, considering it's literally in a mountain basin."
JapanTravel,35ab8p,Ichi-Guren,3,Fri May 8 18:24:08 2015 UTC,"Well I guess my language implies I think the whole place is hilly and I think that was the wrong wording. There certainly inclines though. I remember because I did the bike trail myself and that's one thing I noticed. It is especially noticeable out where Inari shrine, but that's on the Southern edges of the city.   edit  Also if you look at a map you can see that a good portion of the city does have elevated terrain, unless i'm reading the map incorrectly?"
JapanTravel,35ab8p,rainbow_city,2,Fri May 8 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can see now why you would say that :)  There are definitely bike trails that take you up into the mountains and are quite hilly, but if you're just talking about navigating Kyoto proper to see the major sites then you're going to be on pretty level ground throughout the central part of the city. Except, of course, for the sites that take you up into the mountains, like Fushimi Inari and Kyomizu-dera.  I didn't even realize that Yamashina ward was part of Kyoto, but it's painfully obvious in that map link you posted. I thought that the city basically ended on the eastern side where Kyomizu begins. Thanks for correcting that misconception!"
JapanTravel,35ab8p,cluster4,1 point,Fri May 8 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole city confuses me sometimes. I could have sworn inari was further South, but I guess I was just mistaken.  I didn't explore the Western half as much as I would have liked so that may be why the inclines stand out so much for me.  Gosh I want to go back now haha."
JapanTravel,35ab8p,cluster4,1 point,Fri May 8 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"First comment not saying it's illegal/disrespectful. The ""hilly"" problem is because every time you have fun going down, you always have to go up. I'm hesitating... I guess I could take them and figure out once I'm there."

If I'm not visiting Ueno Zoo is there any point going?   Ameyokucho, at Ueno Station, is worth a visit. Kappabashi (kitchen street) is also nearby."

JapanTravel,359k7f,WoolyWookie,2,Sat May 9 06:55:10 2015 UTC,"Despite its name the robot restaurant is not really suited for diner, all they offer is snacks. It's pretty much only a show. So I'd advise eating before or after you go there.  I enjoyed Asakusa, worth going there if you have some spare time. I don't know about the dates you're going, but Harajuku and Yoyogi park are especially entertaining in the weekend. Locals hang out in the park and there's music and dancing. It's doable to visit all those places on day 2/3. As long as you don't spend a lot of time shopping in Shibuya or something. Wether you're able to see Fuji from Hakone really depends on the weather. So if you really want to see it you might want to look at the forecasts before going there.  For Kyoto I can recommend seeing the non-verbal theater show called Gear, real fun show. You get a discount at the ticket sale if you mention you found the place through Tripadvisor. You seem to have some spare time in Osaka, if you can spare a day I recommend going to Koya. It's only a short trip and I found it to be a fantastic place."
JapanTravel,359k7f,Bob_Slefty,1 point,Sun May 10 11:54:32 2015 UTC,"Koishikawa is a traditional style Japanese garden, rather than a park like Ueno. In Ueno you've got some of Tokyo's best museums, including the National Museum so definitely worth visiting if that's your thing. I also recommend the Shitamachi Museum.  Otherwise, I'd have a think about Days 8 & 9. Better to include Kinkakuji on the Arashiyama day and also include Ryoanji and also Ninnaji if time allows. Then on Day 8 you have time to visit other places as well."
JapanTravel,359k7f,its_real_I_swear,1 point,Fri May 8 07:15:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice :) I've just done a bit more research and it does make more sense to fit Arashiyama with some of the other activities and visit some other places on Day 9
JapanTravel,359k7f,MoneyWeHave,1 point,Sat May 9 07:28:13 2015 UTC,Day 13 - Osaka Castle - this isn't really a full day attraction  Fly out of Osaka and don't buy a JR pass.

However it's pretty far from Tokyo, I would really consider spending the night. I don't know when you go, but when I did, the prices were really reasonable for an absolutely awesome experience, compared to other ryokans, dinner included. I've been to several ryokans and, to me, it was the best. Not only for the value for money, but overall."
JapanTravel,357vel,dotken,3,Thu May 7 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Seems fine overall for a slow paced trip. Have you booked your accommodation already? Have you considered overnight buses at all? I assume you will see Peace Park/Museum on the 19th? Any specific reason why you go back to Osaka on the night of the 19th/20th? Might have made more sense to just go straight to Kyoto perhaps. You could also consider a night in a temple at Koyasan perhaps? http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4900.html    14-day JR Pass won't pay off. 7-day JR Pass won't pay off. 21-day JR Pass won't pay off. If you don't use overnight buses then I'd probably get the JR Kansai Hiroshima Area Pass. I would suggest you buy it in Canada. http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_kansai_hiroshima.html Use it for Himeji, Hiroshima/Miyajima, Nara.    Then I'd just pay for the Nozomi Shinkansen from Kyoto to Tokyo and Tokyo back to Osaka. Alternatively, use overnight buses or flights for one/both of these legs.    Assuming your itinerary remains the same, On the 25th I would go to Kitano Tenmangu Temple Market:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3939.html You can consider visiting Kinkakuji after Kitano Tenmangu.    I would buy an ICOCA when you arrive, and use it for all of your travel within a city where possible:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html    Also note rainy season, so make sure you have some plans for the weather:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2273.html http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2277.html    You have a long time in Japan so I would have considered including other places on your itinerary (eg. Kanazawa, Shirakawago, Takayama), but I assume you prefer a relatively slow pace.    For other places you might like for walks/hikes, maybe Kiso Valley, Kamikochi, Nokogiriyama, Mt Takao, heaps of other options:- http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2427.html"
JapanTravel,357vel,david_131,1 point,Thu May 7 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent recommendations.  My accomodations are booked, but can be cancelled/edited anytime before June.   My flight hasn't been booked yet, that's why I wanted to post my itinerary here for insight into my length of stay. It does sound like a full month would be too long there, perhaps I can shorten my trip?  I didn't even know that I would literally be visiting during the rainy season... The only reason why I'm considering it is because Air Canada has a special offer to Osaka and these dates are the only times that work out for me this summer. Kind of disappointed."
JapanTravel,357vel,david_131,2,Thu May 7 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"Can you fly into Osaka and out of Tokyo perhaps? I guess not with the cheap pricing but might be worth checking. I wouldn't completely discount travelling due to the rainy season, you just need to be prepared. Your trip is slow enough that you should be able to be flexible and shuffle things within a city if required. Some places can of course be nice to visit with a bit of rain, less crowds, some atmosphere, etc."
JapanTravel,357vel,Gurtang,2,Fri May 8 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"There is so much to do in Japan that a slow-paced trip like yours can be fine, and that's probably what most people will tell you. Only one thing maybe : spending so much time in Kyoto and Osaka may not be really worth it. They are so close, you can spend a few days in Kyoto and make Osaka a 1 or 2-day trip, for example.  But I'd like to go in another direction. It may be something you absolutely don't want, in that case simply disregard it, it's a simple suggestion. :)  That suggestion is : a full big badass 21-days JR pass.  I know it's expensive, but with it, you can go anywhere in Japan. You're alone, you can travel light, and the geographical disposition of the country (a long line) + ultra reliable and fast Shinkansen give you the opportunity to experience a trip Japanese people will never do without spending tens of thousands of yen in Shinkansen, and to see things many Japanese can't dream of seeing before being retired. And most foreign tourists spend 2 weeks, 3 max, which means, after at least a week between Tokyo and Kyoto, they don't have the time to go to places farther than Hiroshima.  You land in Osaka (or Tokyo), spend a few days in the area (like 3), and then bam, it's on. You can go from Matsushima (in the north, near Sendai), one of the 3 ""best views of Japan"", to Kagoshima (the southernmost point of the japanese mainland) and maybe get a rain of ash from the nearby active volcano, or even take a ferry to Yakushima. Hiroshima, Miyajima, Himeji, all these can be done as stops along the way, and you can add more (like Kanazawa, where the Shinkansen just got this year). On the last day of your JR pass, you go back to the city your plane leaves from, and spend a few days in that area (checking out things you will have saved for that time).  I won't go into more details as it may not be what you're looking for. As I said, aside from a little too much time in Osaka, your itinerary is fine. You could also shorten your trip, which would save you a lot of money.  But if you're interested... :)  About climbing mt Fuji, just google it, there is plenty of accurate info everywhere :)"
JapanTravel,357vel,bladebreakers,1 point,Fri May 8 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I'm planning an 18 day trip for next March, and I'm interested in any specific recommendations you may have!"
JapanTravel,357vel,Gurtang,1 point,Fri May 8 06:59:07 2015 UTC,"Well for an 18 day trip where you want to move a lot, you can take the 14 day JR pass and spend the rest, at the start and end of your trip, in your airport city. Or you can move less and take the 7 days (and make side trips that aren't on the shinkansen outside of these 7 days).  Can't be really specific without knowing your interests :)  If it's your first trip, a good start can be to check out the best rated spots on japan-guide.  Also, if you come in late march, you can be there for the cherry blossoms. :)"
JapanTravel,357vel,bladebreakers,1 point,Fri May 8 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry to bother you, but if you could offer some perspective I would really appreciate it!  This is all still in the very early stages, but this is the very rough plan:   land in Tokyo, go to Hakone where I get to try out an Onsen and other stuff. I plan on using Tokyo as my base here (planning on staying in a hostel) also from Tokyo, make side-trips to Kamakura/Nikko.  Also want to check out Takayama and Shirakawa-go From there, I'll eventually move to Kyoto, and for the next several days, Kyoto will become my base. I plan on visiting several places, including overnighting at Mount Koya.  Again, using Kyoto as my base, I plan on checking out Osaka, and making day trips to Kobe and Hiroshima.  A must see for me is Miyajima/Itsukushima - and here I actually have no idea how much time to allot yet.. And finally, I want to check out Fukuoka (staying at a hostel for a couple days), before flying out of Tokyo again (and I'm guessing I'll find the JR pass pretty helpful).   So despite how scattered this seems, I actually have been researching quite a bit, though I know I have lots more to do! My only concern right now is that I'm looking at maybe too many things...  Basically I am eager to experience as much of the culture as I can."
JapanTravel,357vel,Gurtang,1 point,Sat May 9 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"For everything I'm going to tell you, you should be able to check out the details (especially for the train connections) on japan-guide.   Any particular reason to go to Fukuoka ? If not I wouldn't advise it, it would really make your trip a fast-paced one. It is doable, since Fukuoka is on the Shinkansen, but it's still far and not absolutely amazing (imho, of course). Takayama/Shirakawa-go are sort of tough, because they are not on the main axis, so I don't think they make good side trips, more stops on the way to the west : it takes 4-5 hours to get to Takayama (JR pass covers it). You should spend one night there and then go check out Ogimachi (the main village in Shirakawa-go). The JR pass doesn't cover that.   Of course you can also spend the night at one of the farmhouses in Shirakawa-go, but since it's remote, it is a little more difficult to do in a fast-paced trip (ideally, to have the time to visit both towns, you should spend a night in Takayama and then Shirakawa-go).  Koyasan is also kind of out of the way (and not really covered by the JR pass).  My conclusion is that Takayama + Koyasan + Fukuoka = tough, really fast-paced. I would take one out (for me, Fukuoka).  Here is what it would look like if you want to do it all :    3 days in Tokyo (arrival + 2 days) Leave for Takayama, visit, spend the night Shirakawa-go, visit (advise spending the night) Kyoto at least 2 days, side trip to Osaka, Nara, Himeji, that's 5 in all. Koyasan overnight : 2 days. Fukuoka : 2 days. On the way back, Hiroshima/Miyajima : 2 days. last day of the 14 day JR pass : back to Tokyo. Last days in Tokyo.   You see that this way, you have almost no time in Tokyo and side trips like Nikko/Kamakura/Kawaguchiko. You could get one more day by being really fast in Shirakawa-go and not spending the night there (getting to Kyoto late the same day) but that's all, I think the rest is as compressed as possible. You could also try to fly out from Osaka (or land there and fly out from Tokyo) but that's not common depending on the airline."

Have you checked if there are any festivals happening during your planned days?   I can certainly recommend that you go to specific cities just to see their festivals!   Regarding your itinerary it seems a bit slow-paced. After being in Kyoto for 5 days on my first trip over, Tokyo just seemed quite lack-luster...   Like someone already recommended, I would certainly look up plane tickets that gets you in at Osaka and flies out from Tokyo."
