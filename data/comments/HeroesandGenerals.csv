HeroesandGenerals,3e6p30,patrykK1028,7,Wed Jul 22 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"clears throat  I'll try to do my best:   Stamina is sprinting, essentially. This also includes any jumps you make too, that will lower your bar (down the bottom left). Marathon Badge is good for better stamina. Helps you run to points quickly. Get an SMG. Most capture points are in rooms/confined spaces. And SMG will win most of the time. If you do decide to get a BA, you can reset the distance by pressing space. Do this whenever you ADS pretty much, the meters will be displayed down the bottom right. If you area is in conflict i.e someone is in there or a tank is launching shells in, you won't be able to spawn in there, go back on the map and get back there! Damage upgrades are definitely worth it IMO. Will give you the upper hand in every situation. They will come naturally as you use the weapon, or by buying them if you so desire.. Whistle by pressing F. Not all friendlies will pick you up, they're just arseholes. I like to whistle if I make a good shot or if i'm capturing a point with 7 other guys, etc. Spot enemies by pointing your crosshairs at them for 3 or so seconds. Always spot tanks! This will help everyone in your team tenfold. If the tank moves or the red box disappears, and you have a spare 3 seconds, spot again!  Nope, all factions have a jeep, a motorbike and an APC truck. Some games you just can't use them though, but both sides have equal resources in every battle. Not to my knowledge, but it just feels good to win, doesn't it? Transportation, meaning you can get back to the point quicker etc. War can be annoying, I mainly stick to Staged Battles. They're fun. Repairing the weapons and ammo will ensure it is performing at 100%. Auto repair is a good counter for this, also have to click auto repair on every upgrade you have on your weapon.  Enjoy :)"
HeroesandGenerals,3e6p30,Fat_Loaf,2,Wed Jul 22 11:47:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer!   Also, could you answer my updated 11. (question about grenades) and 12. question (that displays as 1. for some reason)?"
HeroesandGenerals,3e6p30,Fat_Loaf,2,Wed Jul 22 12:11:31 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Yeah, try to keep on top of the repairs as much as possible, explosives are expensive to maintain, but worth it if you want to take out 3 or 4 men with one 'nade.  If you are struggling for credits to repair or even buy weapons/equipment play some of the Skirmish modes (in Staged Battles you'll find them up the top of the list). They are smaller quicker games and produce more credits.   1/12. haha.. Yep, you should be able to do that once you are in a game, hit Escape, then goto Input Options, the goto Advanced(I think it's called that) then there should be a bubble on the side for the toggle option. I unticked all of my toggle options, also helped to change C to crouch and X to prone. Or whatever is most comfortable.."
HeroesandGenerals,3e6p30,kailen_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"Im used to Ctrl for prone and C for crouch, but I will have to check if these arent used by anything else. Thank you again!"
HeroesandGenerals,3e6p30,kailen_,2,Wed Jul 22 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry but i have to correct a few things said here. He mostly gave good answers but.  (3. except skirmish maps on those there are just the 3 capture points and the 1 spawn point per side.  (4. don't know what he means by come naturally, you still have to buy them with credits and they can be expensive to repair. They can be great depending on your weapon and what you're trying to do. Be careful upgrading ammo it is typically the most expensive to maintain.  (6. Yes what he said when you see red triangle or a square for vehicles everyone on your team can see that   (7. only in staged battles do both sides have equal resources. On that note play staged until you get the hang of everything. I still mostly play staged just because i get in matches faster.  (8. you lose nothing by losing, in fact you still get your base salary.   (9. Yes if you buy a jeep and there are resources for jeeps on the map you can spawn into it. When you are on the spawn screen in the lower right it shows what assault team you have selected. Pay attention to this motorized infantry have jeeps, motorized guard have the motorcycles and mechanized infantry have the apcs.  EDIT: changing this is also how you can change which line you are spawning in from on the large maps (IE changing from B line to C line)  (11. With weapons it works the same until it is broken (as far as im aware) then you can't use it same with upgrades to weapons. Things like grenades come in boxes of a certain amount repairing those is simply buying more, i think you can actually see how many grenades you have left. Auto repair can be nice but ive learned id rather know how much im using stuff and repair it on my own. Auto repair can make you broke quick if you have it on everything you own.   EDIT: i actually numbered these to go with the above replies but it formatted to 1 ,2,3 ect so i went back and to try and fix it"

HeroesandGenerals,3e5ujr,Entreri000,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:49:52 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of steam vs browser having a ping difference. Maybe you were just having bad luck with being put in EU servers instead of NA (NA servers if you live in EU). I get about 70 ping in NA servers, but probably 30% of the games I play I am put in a EU server where I get 140-160 ping. This % is drastically increased when I am playing late at night (however I prefer this late at night since the NA servers are underpopulated and aren't much fun.  On my old computer though, the browser version gave me much higher fps. Don't have that issue with this one though so I play through steam."
HeroesandGenerals,3e4l39,TraditionalProgester,4,Tue Jul 21 22:25:09 2015 UTC,"Same situation. In most battles where players fight the match the soviets seem to die twice for every enemy soldier they kill. This means you're spending more warfunds than you earn. This didn't used to be the case. For a while after the soviets were added to the game we actually did really well in battles, but lacked assault teams.  I suspect the new weapons the other factions got has a lot to do with this. On one hand partly from pulling experienced players from the SU side to go play with the new shiny toys, and second from the new shiny toys being ones that wreck face at medium to long range...killing all the SU guys before they can get to a capture zone.  I know the FPS side of the game has changed a lot for me. Before Walker I used to get very high kdr's and a ton of captures. Now in half of the battles I play nobody can even reach the points to capture. Compounding this, all the really good players having switched sides to try the new toys means we tend to start battles with fewer players than the other team. So you wind up in a head to head rush where one side has greater firepower per person, on average, in addition to straight up having more players. It doesn't matter then if you have 800 infantry spawns, they're going to roll up your assault line and win by forcing a retreat.  For making warfunds through RTS it seems like the main way to do it now is through auto-resolves. Find a battle with no players and roughly equal but low count forces, and throw your troops in. At the end of the auto resolve the side with the greater numbers wins and the other side is utterly destroyed, with the corresponding warfunds being distributed to the officers whose ATs were present.  Not very reliable though, often so many other people do the same thing that the numbers rise until FPS players are tempted to join the battle. Then they get roflstomped."
HeroesandGenerals,3e4l39,CdnGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"The best way of getting warfunds is to play the FPS game and capture points.  As a general it's pretty hard.  Defence is a pretty good way of earning warfunds.  There's also autoresolves (i.e. stacking in so many troops that after about half an hour without anyone jumping in the queue or the game starting, you win without taking a loss).  But you have to be pretty lucky to get an autoresolve.  Edit:  Another good way is to play the game your troops are in to make certain that things like tanks, APCs, etc are getting killed.  You get warfunds for killing equipment, provided you were using your own troops."
HeroesandGenerals,3e4l39,cashpig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"Soviet players were mostly German defectors, with new toys on both allied and german sides it's probably not worth deploying war units until Reto nerfs the 44 and everyone comes crying back."

HeroesandGenerals,3e22lh,ohbarf,3,Tue Jul 21 15:24:51 2015 UTC,Grass is always greener I guess.   I think it would be cool if there was like a foreign tech badge that let you buy other nations weapons at increased cost and repair cost (maybe only let you upgrade parts you have picked up on from stolen weapons on the battlefield.) But then you would not have the uniqueness of the different sides and might make it more pay to win.
HeroesandGenerals,3e22lh,kailen_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:33 2015 UTC,Perhaps a scavenger variant that permitted an expertise in a foreign (captured) weapon? It should be a higher tier badge so it takes a badge slot to run it perhaps?

I could be playing with my MG42 with my main character, gain a shit ton of money from skirmishes, and then use that money to fund another soldier and buy him ribbons to unlock, let's say a bolt action, and never ever have to grind.  You can practically buy your way to make a character maxed out in ribbons without ever having played on him.  That said, the grind was what kept me on the game. I enjoyed every moment that I played and after each unlock, I felt like I needed to keep advancing to reach the next goal. The new system of unlocking mods one at a time is a pretty sweet idea designed to never get you bored of what you have."

HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,Kahzootoh,5,Tue Jul 21 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"Until now I wasn't aware the Greyhound only did half the damage of the M5 Stuart, which is a rather big divergence from historical reality given that both vehicles carried the same 37mm M3 Gun.   As for the Soviets, I think that Reto ought to have considered giving them something along the lines of the BA-10 or even the T-70 instead. It's generally a good idea to match vehicles with similar weights when looking for relatively balanced vehicles. The SDKfz 222 weighs 4 tons, the Greyhound weighs 7.8 tons (but is severely handicapped), and the BA-64 weighs 2.4 tons. With that in mind, it's no wonder that the BA-64 is going to require some serious reality bending from the Developers to compete against the other two vehicles. The BA-10 is closer to the SDkfz 222 and the Greyhound in weight at 5 tons.   New content takes forever, but Reto should consider adding tiers to the Recon vehicles- with weight and capabilities being the determining factor. Let the heavier/more capable vehicles be higher tier and the lighter/less capable vehicles be the starter Recon vehicles because right now, the Devs are bending reality from both ends; the BA-64 is buffed beyond its historical counterpart and the Greyhound is severely nerfed from what it could actually do- in reality, a Greyhound was able to destroy a Tiger I by getting behind it with its high speed."
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,smit0183,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:41 2015 UTC,"With recon teirs, they probably didn't want to encourage recon to become a sort of tank role once you unlocked the first armoured car, I'd LOVE to see the BA-10 given to the Soviets though. I'd also love to see the recon class given some sort of spotting reward for actually doing reconnaissance work."
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,Kahzootoh,2,Tue Jul 21 07:51:46 2015 UTC,"Whoops, meant to say the T-60. At any rate the T-60 isn't much more than a Sdkfz 222 on treads, as it only weighs 6 tons and carried a 20mm cannon.   The thing about recon vehicles is that finding the enemy isn't of much help if you are unable to effectively engage upon contact. You can see that borne out by the gradual increases in weaponry by all sides in WW2 of their forward scouting units. None of them had much armor to give them speed, but they were all carrying weapons that could destroy anything less than a medium tank. The doctrine of ""I'm going to find the target and report it"" became ""I am going to report what I find and destroy targets of opportunity"" as developments progressed. Tactically, it allows your recon units to destroy enemy recon elements and thus ensure that you have intelligence while the enemy does not."
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,smit0183,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:08:46 2015 UTC,"The T-60 makes a hell of a lot more sense than the T-70 indeed.   But remember you also have to take a step back and try and adapt that way of thinking to the video game, which isn't always easy."
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,nerdz0r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:29:31 2015 UTC,Recon tiers would be great.    Also I think Reto could make the ba-64 suck far far far less by just improving the mg instead of having such a dysfunctional abomination found presently.
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,johnibizu,3,Tue Jul 21 04:11:35 2015 UTC,Solution. Reto release the BA-10.  45 mm cannon compared to Greyhound/Stuarts 37mm.
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,smit0183,5,Tue Jul 21 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"Well for a start the Kfz doesn't shoot one round like a tank. It has a 20mm auto cannon so it's not going to destroy a greyhound in one round. These armoured cars weren't designed in real life to fight each other, they were more of an anti-infantry support. So it would be a bit silly of the to make the Greyhounds 37mm, the Kfz's 20mm and the BA-64's 7.62mm do the same amount of damage. My advice is to try and out range the Kfz with the greyhound so you don't eat a full clip of 20mm, as for the BA shitbox, stick to fighting infantry."
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,smit0183,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:23 2015 UTC,222 Does kill a greyhound in 1 round Grey has 37mm cannon yet does half the dmg as a stuart (which is how it should be) so no they don't do all the same dmg. Soviet shitter box is a german/usa normal car not armoured car If the game was 100% realistic i wouldn't care but it's not Each faction should have weakness and strengths in each area yet there is none for recon germans with a 222
HeroesandGenerals,3e05lx,mickdude2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"Mate, I have the Kfz 222 and I'm telling you if I shot one round at a Greyhound, it would not blow up. If they lowered the Greyhounds reload time it would probably make up difference and make the fights a little closer. You could probably also lower the Kfz's damage a little bit because it's a little too good at taking out enemy tanks at the moment, mind you, you can't eat to many tank rounds in it either. I've never used or seen the Soviet BA ingame but I just assumed it would be armoured against small arms."

HeroesandGenerals,3dwntv,Sander071,4,Mon Jul 20 12:50:35 2015 UTC,Exactly that. Covering a tanker's blind spots makes a huge difference when faced against anti-tank infantry.

HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,cashpig,7,Mon Jul 20 00:21:30 2015 UTC,"The concept of an assault rifle is that it performs well in most situations. That is a big part of the reason the STG44 performs so well. I don't think it's a matter of just being smart about engaging so much as the STG44 (like any assault rifle) is well rounded enough that it doesn't suffer outside a certain type of engagement.   In my experience, the STG44's only real shortcomings are at the extremes- it won't beat a bolt action sniper rifle at extreme distances and it won't beat a RoF modded SMG at close range (it is still quite deadly at close range though against slower/non-modded smgs). Any assault rifle is going to be this way, it's why most of the various military forces of the world moved towards assault rifles after WW2.   A big part of the controversy surrounded the STG44 is that it completely outclasses the semi-auto rifles and any BA that isn't a OHK or scoped, especially with the latest iron sight nerf. Since Reto decided to make playing a rifleman necessary for advancement (you cannot even get a starter SMG anymore), a lot of players are going to be forced to confront the STG44 with Semi-auto or bolt action rifles.   Sure, good tactics will negate some of the STG44's advantages but the same is true of infantry vs tank engagements and no one is suggesting that your typical infantryman is equal to a tank. The STG44's effectiveness covers a lot more of the combat spectrum than other rifles. It's handier than an LMG (you can use it more like an SMG in close quarters), has more firepower than an SA (you can use it more like an LMG when exchanging fire), reaches out much further than an SMG, and will beat some some of the slower SMGs in close quarters by virtue of its rate of fire and damage. It's not so much a matter of players engaging at optimal ranges as the strength of the assault rifle concept."
HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,Kahzootoh,4,Mon Jul 20 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"To add on to this - outside of the M1/M2, there is not much competition that exists for the STG. Unless Soviets get the AVS (which doesn't compare to the STG, IMO), then Germany is going to win infantry 80/90% of the time as more people get it."
HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,bahgelovich,3,Mon Jul 20 01:17:05 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't have a problem with the STG being a powerful gun because it is right at the top of the skill tree and is expensive to buy.  Those who grind up should be rewarded.

HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,dms110,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:23 2015 UTC,Tried it today for the first time. Great all-around weapon. Feels like an upgraded SA.It's worse than mp40 under a certain range as I feel the mp40 has both better accuracy and rpm and almost same dmg with wulf faust ammo. It also has the annoyance of smoke or something when trying to kill people further away..weapon sight+smoke blocks target and it's a little hard following up sometimes.  The 7 required slots is mehh.... I still prefer the smg+BA combo.  Will be intresting to see what the russians get :)

Just try to remember the games you had and the range your shoot-outs usually happens.  I have talked about this in some other post just a week ago which is a bit detailed on this disparity. Check it here.  (for reference what 50m means for me, its shorter than the distance between the airfield C2 building and the nearest pillbox entrance.)"
HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,johnibizu,2,Mon Jul 20 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"You are correct but short ranges 50m and below rarely happens in games even if you're capping.   You and me must play a very different style of game then.  I had a quick look at my stats.    About 47 per cent of my kills are using an SMG (28,656 of 61,139), which would be within that 50m distance.  (Just to be clear, this is MP40, Thompson, PPSH, MP34, PPD and Grease Gun).  When I add in my melee weapons and pistols, this increases to about 48 per cent (29,616 of 61,139).    So I don't think it's rare to have kills in close."
HeroesandGenerals,3dw0yd,johnibizu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"Just play a game. Stats does not really show the range of your shoot-outs and that's only kills. Dying while rushing with a jeep, dying while walking(and trying to shoot) is not seen in stats.  And of course anyone can have a short-range shootout if you force it with a jeep but you'll likely just kill one person and not achieve anything. That will really show that you have a high SMG kill. Para will only increase that but that's their forte.  I'll also remind what I mean with below 50m range which is below the C2 airfield building to its nearest pillbox entrace."

I check the subreddit every couple of weeks to see if stuff changes, maybe install the game again to play a few hours, then quit. I simply can't be arsed to grind for hours or pay to get the right to use equipment in a shooter that really has not differentiated itself from the hundreds of others out there. The only F2P games that I enjoy are ones that bring something unique to the table such as WoT, WoWS, or WT. H&G is just not there yet, it is currently just another WWII shooter with a few extra features. Of course, that would not be a bad thing if grinding wasn't required, there is a reason WWII shooters have always been popular.  The thing is that if I want to play a great WWII shooter, I will go play RO2 or Darkest Hour. If I want to play a largescale WWII shooter with good tank gameplay, I will go resubscribe to WWIIOL for a month. If I want to play WWII aircraft, only with far better controls, damage model, and variety, I will go play Warthunder. I simply have no reason to play H&G because so many games do the same thing, but better or without the grind or both. WWII shooters are fun, and H&G is a great one, but the simple fact that there are so fucking many WWII shooters means that there is no reason to grind for hours for the right to play this when you can play another game and not have to grind."

This is because they don't appreciate the fact that someone else is effectively paying for them to destroy the equipment or they are simply too new to understand how it works."

It takes time to develop skills and become effective in the game. Eventually you'll go from averaging 300 to averaging 1000 a game. That certainly takes the edge off the grind.   That being said; some things you can do to improve your score is cap points like crazy, defend points, and push the objectives. You get bonus points for all these.   And as for your comment about beta- well, it is beta. What do you want us to say? It's not like there's pieces of the game they aren't working on.

But I remember what it was like to unlock tanker, or paratroooper, so the grind is noticeable. But at the higher ranks of play it takes over 1 million points to unlock the next rank. If you play long enough, you forget about the grind. The 0-1000xp you get for each battle is a drop in the bucket. To rank up, you need assault teams, and if you knew how long it takes to build and deploy those, you'd be lucky to make 10,000xp a day. That is, assuming your team isn't stuck in a build queue, or the war doesn't end before you can deploy.   Change your way of thinking. You're not trying to unlock a super weapon, frustrated you don't have the magic bullet, grinding hundreds of matches to get it... Instead, what you are trying to do is score the most points per game. Focus on that. What can YOU do better? Baby step your way to the top. The weapons will come. All I'm saying is, if you think the grind is bad now, it will never get shorter. The more you play, the longer it takes to unlock something.  I've been a Major for 8 months."

It's actually been in beta for more than three years (if not four).   Regarding the ""scummy"" model, I think it's a fair model. You can play this game completely free.  That's pretty generous really.  Even Veteran membership can be attained without any money.  I think the way the newest update has shifted things make it feel even more grindy.  However if you enjoy the game, why not support the company a little?  They let you play for free but they need to pay the bills.  If you want to ride things out without paying a cent, expect a long journey.  If you are having fun along the way, is it really a grind anyway?   You may be in a hurry to unlock new shiny things which will make it seem even slower.  And on top of that, the progressions are indeed slower now than before.  As for myself, I have been ""grinding"" with a simple one mod rifle and grenades and still having fun.

HeroesandGenerals,3doaeh,creativ1ty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"To directly answer your question: When you use the Windows functions it changes some states in the graphics context for DirectX that restrict how much control over the system HnG has. This allows other programs to open/render again. When you change to and from borderless, it fetches a new context, so it's back at a state similar to the one before Windows screwed it up.  Ideally, the game would detect when Windows is done and undo the changes, without having to manually refresh. But Heroes and Generals isn't doing this, either because of developer error or because of a bug somewhere (probably both, knowing how reliable the rest of their renderer is).   https://m.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39wbpu/eli5_why_do_some_video_games_alttab_quickly_and/cs765gw  This ELI5 has a few good comments the explain.

Salary should be there to give weaker players enough credits to pay for their mods + some profit, but the top players who have a good game should be given a lot more credits to reward them for their play imo.  That does seem like a really low scoring game though for some reason. Not many caps for anybody involved. High K/D, but not much score so that's why you didn't make 5-6000 credits. Still my first point should be valid.  One thing you can try is to get two soldiers' salaries in a single match. I think to acquire a salary you need to be alive with that soldier for 50% of the game or 10 minutes. So if you feel like you've played that soldier for over 10 minutes in the game and you are confident that the game will last another 10 minutes, it could be worthwhile switching to a different soldier for the rest of the match to get his salary as well.  I do this quite often and can get 7000-8500 credits in games."

Or if you reach 10 minutes and it hasn't been halfway through, you can get the 50% on the other. Or you can reach 10 minutes on both which is the most likely scenario."
HeroesandGenerals,3dmfu2,spacemanbasics,5,Sat Jul 18 21:44:15 2015 UTC,Here's your problem. You're looking at you K/D not on your score; the real thing you're credited for. So 647 is an average score imo. I can get that with a few tank kills and couple of caps. Good players usually get over a 1000. The higher your score the higher the credits.  Also higher score → more xp → higher rank → more salary.

HeroesandGenerals,3dmfu2,goodoldxelos,7,Fri Jul 17 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"Captures, kills, and defenses all give the same xp whether you are rank 1 or rank 12. 647 is a very average score. 1000+ I consider to be pretty good. Highest I've ever seen is over 10k.   K/D means absolutely nothing in this game. The game rewards playing the objective, not kills."
HeroesandGenerals,3dmfu2,mickdude2,2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"Part of me wishes they did reward kills a little more in certain situations. In the middle of a field away from objectives, it's fine as it is, but if I cap an objective and kill 6 guys in the process, that was probably a harder than average cap, and it would be nice to get a little more for it. If you're on a point and killing guys you're clearly defending, at the moment the game promotes trading captures much more than it rewards holding on to what you have capped"
HeroesandGenerals,3dmfu2,AntlerFox,0,Sat Jul 18 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think ""offense"" kills should be a thing, and it's something worth looking into. I think it should be over twice a ""savior"" kill but roughly under a defense."

Play 15 minute skirmishes for fast money. Playing a large map can take over an hour sometimes and will still pay out 5k. Playing Skirmishes pay the same. Stay infantry. Support roles make the least amount of money and have the highest repair costs because of their specialized weapons. Infantry is cheap, simple, and effective.

Therefore capturing points and defending those points gets you revenue. How often do you see half your team as infantry just crouching a field having a sniper war with the next capture point.  I played this game for a year and a half with not a single cent invested and I never had a problem being in the top 5 on the scoreboard... If you play it properly you wont either."

You use them to force tanks to be cautious and slow or pay the price.  If you want to take an active role in removing tanks from the battlefield, equip any other antitank weapon. Personally I prefer sticky grenades because they have decent range and only take two equipment slots. Can also be used as a semi-silent expensive grenade.  Spot tanks whenever it is safe to do so. If your team has smart tankers, this is very helpful information to them because their view is very limited and sometimes tanks can be shot blindly behind bush and trees."

You have to attack from the rear or else it won't make a dent. But perhaps the way it works, and this is just an idea, is that the stickies work like H3 grenades that once you place them they will penetrate. To a certain degree of course. But the RPG-43 works like a tank shell in the case that you will get the occasional impact angle. But if I'm wrong, it should penetrate 100% of the time on all tanks but heavy."
HeroesandGenerals,3dcu95,CmdrCollins,2,Wed Jul 15 12:36:16 2015 UTC,"You have basically three categories of anti-tank weaponry deployed by infantry in WW2:  1) AT-Rifles, usually shooting a oversized rifle cartridge, penetrating by kinetic force and already outdated by the start of the war. Currently only PTRD, albeit imbalanced against infantry (and to some extent soft) targets.  2) Sticky grenades, not meant to penetrate, but to disable tanks by immobilizing them, leaving the killing to vehicle based AT. Currently only Sticky Bomb.  3) Shaped charges, penetrating by kinetic energy supplied by the warhead, this is where infantry deployed AT went after WW2 and still is today. Currently Panzerfaust, Bazooka, H3 and RPG-43."

HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,Memorizing_Fallout,11,Tue Jul 14 22:26:00 2015 UTC,Other games glorify snipers so they try HnG and often leave butt hurt.
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,woohooguy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I don't understand is why so many snipers are glorified in games. You just get a telescope attached to your gun and get to wait in the same position for days hoping some enemy walks by. Yeah its cool and I enjoy it sometimes, it's just not my style."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,CaptainCortez,2,Tue Jul 14 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of mediocre gamers tend to play very passively in multiplayer games in general.  Being a sniper allows them to get a few kills without constantly dying.  This lets them feel like they are a decent player, even though they aren't contributing much to the outcome of the battle.  I also play a lot of World of Tanks and you have the same problem there.  Half of every team plays completely passively (sniper camping, basically) and only a handful of players on each team actually decide the outcome of the fight."

HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,IPwndULstNght,3,Thu Jul 16 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"Snipers in real life are considered as 'force multipliers'. One sniper can hold up a battalion of soldiers trying to advance, i.e. Russian snipers in Stalingrad holding up the Wehrmacht. I guess that stigma of being an important soldier in the army kinda stuck.  In H&G where the name of the game is to cap, cap, cap, Recons are mostly unneeded unless defending a point, that's what they're really good at.  I don't like being a sniper. I find it boring and it doesn't pay well. Capturing objectives and clearing out a room is much more fun and helps the team alot more than just camping. One bad thing about bringing a scope rifle is that once someone closes the gap between you and him, like 20m, the guy holding the machine gun is likely to win and tea bag your body."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,nerdz0r,3,Tue Jul 14 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah if recons were played more like real life where they are restricted and elite, I'd probably like the snipers in H&G better. I just don't like waiting and waiting. It's too boring."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,compugasm,2,Tue Jul 14 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"I think u are underestimating the power of a good recon while capping a point, a good recon can do a huge punch in a attacking wave trying to stop or retake a capzone, but alot of the time the infantry don't see that inside the building.   And a aggressive sniper can easly be on top of the chart with points and kills, i think alot of Long distance snipers turn to aggressive sniping after they get tired of camping, and they either do great or change class"
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,adenian202,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:00 2015 UTC,"Recons are still useful even on the attack. So long as you remain in a flanking position, most Recons can effectively disorient the enemy, distract the enemy and pick off the odd stragglers.   Defense, truly, is where they shine. Shooting things running at you is easier than having to run to shoot things."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,Zackory,3,Wed Jul 15 21:33:40 2015 UTC,i prefer battle rifles. ive been gunning for the scope for my gewehr. aside from that i like lmg play as well. sniper gameplay seems cool in concept but imo it's pretty boring
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,hemansteve,3,Tue Jul 14 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"There is no denying the mass appeal.  The business model seems to revolve around selling scopes.    You can argue that snipers are pointless in this game.  There's no real high-value targets.  The gameplay is based more around mobility, not so much static defense.  There's no MG bipod/tripods or mortar teams or antitank gun crews.  The most strategic things would be sniping tankers popping up or AA gunners."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,Doughpanda,3,Wed Jul 15 00:37:27 2015 UTC,"You can argue that snipers are pointless in this game... The most strategic things would be sniping tankers popping up or AA gunners.   They're not so pointless then. Snipers who spot enemy tanks, kill the drivers, or keep friendly tanks clear of enemies are things that all go unnoticed while you guys sit in your metal turtles. I stress, that these things happen without you even knowing about it. So from your perspective we 'do nothing' except keep you safe and help the team win. Your welcome."

HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,nerdz0r,2,Wed Jul 15 00:49:01 2015 UTC,"I try to play an aggressive sniper. I use a 4x scope on my recon and get up close. I still find somewhere that I can ""camp"" quite often, but I try to make these spots really close to the action. I find it a very satisfying way to kill people. Kind of like there is a lot on the line with my first and potentially second shot since if I miss once I might be dead and if I miss a second time, I am almost always going to be dead."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,Sergiiy,2,Tue Jul 14 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"H&G is really a single player game, masquerading as multiplayer. Almost nobody is communicating by voice like you would in ARMA or Battlefield. You can tell, because enemies run like a line of ants toward the objectives, ala 'Rambo' style. Or, they zoom off in their vehicles and leave the tanks undefended. The point is, 99% of the time your team sucks, and relying on them to do their job will only lead to frustration. The sniper is a solitary unit. It doesn't need team support, that's why I play it.  Because you operate alone, I feel it takes more skill to play this character. You have to know where to hide, conceal yourself, be sneaky. If you're not making a lot of kills, then that is your clue this is not the right location. You have to know when to move, where to move too, and where the enemy is going to be. The whole goal of a sniper, is to defend objectives/players and kill as many people as possible, without being killed himself. It's all about stealth and positioning. So a good amount of time spent as a sniper is learning what you need to do, and where you need to be. It's called tactics, and that's why it's fun.   With a sniper, there is a good chance to escape every death. If only you checked behind you, Or didn't sit in one spot for so long, or placed a mine behind you, or something else you could've done something about had you been paying attention... Whereas in infantry, your reaching the objective has a lot of luck behind it. Just as you might not find it fun to lay down, spotting a tanker for 3 minutes, I also don't find it fun to run and die repeatedly until the lucky event when I make it to the objective unscathed. To me, it doesn't seem like infantry takes more skill, or is somehow an 'honorable' way to play this game."
HeroesandGenerals,3db5re,Sergiiy,2,Wed Jul 15 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"I have no problem when people play sniper to actually help out and do their job, but when they do it just to have the advantage of an ohk rifle and get a 50-4 kill ratio that pisses me off. There is a lot more of the game you could be experiencing but instead you want to join the millions of other snipers who play and not be unique at all. Your style of play is totally fine, I just don't like the obsession with a sniper. I can run around with my BAR and still have tons of fun wrecking enemies with it, or I can hop in my metal turtle and reign havoc on the battlefield. There are many different styles of play which makes H&G unique and just focusing on the sniper side is dumb for a non seasoned player to do. It turns the game into another sniper elite game or something. If you've leveled and sniping is your thing and you are good at it I have no problem, but it is all of these ohk wannabes that piss me off."

HeroesandGenerals,3d8ul0,downster,8,Tue Jul 14 12:15:35 2015 UTC,"I play 3 factions(staged) and from experience Germany always wins, US second and Russia almost never wins. If US against Germany, Germany wins 60 to 80% of the time if US against Russia, almost equal and if its Russia vs Germany, Germany wins 90% of the time. Even becomes more true with the latest Walker update. If you plan to get credits, play Germany.  There is a gun/armor disparity. Its true and you're just fooling yourself if you don't see it. Almost all German's semi-auto/auto guns are great at mid ranges. MG42, STG and even the MP40. You can definitely hit someone in 100m or less and good players can hit even beyond that. They only lose out to the other faction's guns if its less than ~50m which happens rarely in games even if you're trying to cap. Thompson is almost at par with MP40's range hitting capabilities. Degtyarev is horrible when compared to the MG42. You can walk while shooting with the MG42 without losing control while its almost mandatory to crouch using the Degtyarev and even worse with the m1919 mg which is extremely useless that most switch back to m1918. With the inclusion of STG, its almost useless to attack a group of defending Germans. Carbine is only good at picking off bikers/car riders or those walking in an open area but if you're looking for a gun which you can use to cap,defend and snipe with, you'll choose the STG.  With regards to armor, Laughable to even use the Russian recon armor, American one has so much recoil per shot its almost as if the barrel is made of straws. Tanks are almost at parity between three factions except German's StuG III Ausf. F. However the extremely large and long Russian tanks is harder to hide and find cover than any other tanks.  And then add the insane amount of Veteran/old/experienced German faction players, Germany will always be on top."
HeroesandGenerals,3d8ul0,johnibizu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think you've overestimated all your distances. Maybe cut everything in half? (that's for all sides. The ranges you've given just seem too high.)   German medium armor is also terrible, and the allies get selective fire for the Thompson. When you set it to SA, it's pretty accurate.   Russia still falls behind though. For a while they had a lot more coordination than even the Germans, but I'm not sure what happened there."
HeroesandGenerals,3d8ul0,TangibleLight,4,Fri Jul 17 14:22:50 2015 UTC,There just doesn't seem a way for the Soviets to win a staged battle. 90% of the time I'm matched against the Germans which are heavily OP IMO. We could really use some love from Reto..

Not to mention the fact that many german players are simply better at the game than some of the Soviets. There is a language barrier on Soviet too, since most Russians play that faction. It isn't a problem for me (I speak russian) but I can see how difficult it would be for non-russian speakers.  I just stick to the US for now, if the soviets get some new weapons I'll switch back, but for now the BAR is too good :D"

The Russian teams almost always have no people with decent weapons. The majority have mosins, and none of them 1 shot, feels like the entirety of the american team has a BAR or an m1. I'll tell ya, it always feels like were down until mid way into the battle when we pick up enemy weapons. If you watch the kill feed eventually it will look like the US supplied the Russians. Of course this is the same thing that happens against the Germans. Now the real kicker is that it always seems like no matter what if you get the enemy ticket counter under 100 it always gets reinforced. No joke, the absolute best match i had yesterday went on for an hour or so. on 4 separate occasions the germans ticket counter went back up above ours after we mowed them down. We lost even though we had the superior skill, more kills, less deaths, only 1 tank (they had 2),  and we had a team that would pick up bazookas to help. It was fantastic. tragic but fantastic. I'm not upset these are just the obvious notables when you play as a soviet."

The Driver's turret is locked to the hull which means you have to slowly rotate your entire tank if you want to move the turret, its slow compared to the other medium tanks, and its 37mm turret sticks out. Like others have said, go for the Lee if you plan on playing with friends and go for Infantry and Lightly Armoured vehicles instead of other Medium Tanks, only attack them if you have no other choice or if they're already damaged."

You can take a positive attitude towards the changes, certainly there are many favorable aspects to Walker (new toys and XP to match Gold purchases) though you cannot deny that weapons have been nurfed, prices have been buffed and long term in game goals have become less appealing now high class weapons and perks can be purchased with money.   All in all I challenge anyone to start a new account and tell me the level of despair for progress and pressure to pay isn't worse. If you still think it's great then convince a friend to play, most will tell you they have no interest investing 100+ hours just to be on par with the regular players, learning new maps and making mistakes with their in game finances that leave them bankrupt early for a goal that some kid can buy with a credit card.  Just look at the negative reviews the game gets on steam and;  Shows that player numbers have been dropping since April."

I am hoping that by getting my mosin ribbon maxed before switching to recon, I'll already have the gun as OHK and have any of the scopes that I want to purchase available to me.  I would guess that you don't have to buy the gun, but it doesn't come with a scope by default so you have to buy yourself a scope?"

I don't have camo yet so I'd probably take that over marathon if I had it, especially if I was using an 8x and sitting back more.  But I play my recon like an infantry a lot of the time rushing around to points. I also use the 4x scope instead of the 8x."
HeroesandGenerals,3d8knc,spacemanbasics,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:15:43 2015 UTC,Sway is at its worst at distance. For that reasons Quick draw and Dead eye would be pretty useless as they are suited to closer combat and hip firing as opposed to scopes. I don't think cone expansion is the same factor as sway and thus once again wouldn't have much effect. I'd like to test that theory but my Recons tight grip is bronze and there is only one spot for my Ghillie Gold.

HeroesandGenerals,3d315l,Fat_Loaf,10,Mon Jul 13 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"I like your suggestion a lot, because it would be progress in player communication.   But I don't know why they haven't added local area voice chat yet.  I feel a majority of problems with even the smallest firefights in this game could be solved by saying ""hey, there's someone behind you,"" or ""hey, enemy car inbound, four guys.""   In Planetside 2 and Arma 2, battles were won and lost by this sort of micromanagement of threat identification. There were several times where I:   Saw a tank about to hit a mine, called out to him, and saved his life. Warned infantry of AP mines. Saved point defenses by warning of impending infantry storms. Called out orbital drops. Seriously, you can save a lot of lives in H&G by calling out paratroopers. Stopped medics from from waltzing out into a killzone of enemy tanks as they went to revive a downed teammate. ""Don't peek, snipers."" ""Don't go that way, terrain mask, use the hill."" ""They're flanking left! Cover me, I'm moving to intercept. Get them if they get me."" ""Follow me, it's safer this way."" ""Get off the gun! They're behind you!""   Now imagine a whole squad of thinking, analyzing players doing this sort of thing. And now imagine a whole team made up of these squads. Now imagine this team going up against a team just like them, communicating, working together in addition to seeking their own individual objectives.  Some of my fondest memories of Planetside involved getting really immersed in the moment. There's nothing more satisfying than hearing the cheering of two dozen soldiers after a hard-won victory that won a war. Or hearing someone shout frightfully, ""The APC just got tanked!"" ""Aircraft inbound, find cover!""  Right now, I think the community needs to push Reto to implement some form of team-only local area voice chat. There's no question here, the game would be better for it. Teamwork would improve outright. VO callouts would be a definite step in the right direction, but it would only be a band-aid on a more serious communication concern, and would not encourage leadership and urgency in battle that some of H&G's competitors have already established.  Local voice chat the most correct choice for this communication problem.  And if you run into a problem player? Mute function. Solved. Keep playing."
HeroesandGenerals,3d315l,KeystoneGray,3,Mon Jul 13 09:32:45 2015 UTC,"Love the idea of team-only VOIP, and like others mentioned perhaps a quick-command menu of basic commands for those without mic.   And another idea; perhaps vehicle only option for VOIP, for you and your co-gunner inside the tank so you don't clutter the main line of comms.   Also - would you think proximity should come into play with the VOIP or just a broad team wide channel that you can hear and speak to from anywhere?"
HeroesandGenerals,3d315l,b1ghead3d,3,Mon Jul 13 12:04:35 2015 UTC,"Proximity would help narrow down context and avoid audible clutter. I specifically avoided theorizing about how map-wide comms would work, because that wasn't the argument I was making and it was a separate topic. I can make it here though, in this separate post.  The way I'd like to see team-wide comms be implemented would be by use of radios. These will be automatically granted to tank and plane pilots while they are within their vehicle. Paratroopers will also hear this channel when inside their plane, in case they might catch critical information regarding the battle on the ground while waiting to hit their drop point.  A clan squad that queues up for a mission will build their team based on what they need to be efficient, and that means that a member of their team can spec to be a radio operator. In fact, I'd like to see the equipping of the infantry radio be limited to just clanned squads. Two reasons for this.   The game needs more encouragement of clan play. As of now, there's no functional support for large clan play for H&G, mainly because having a group of more than six clan mates in a game requires sheer luck. Taking a radio should be a serious equipment consideration. They are your standard bearer. Their voice will have more impact than a line of text because they are in active dialog with armor and aircraft.   Randoms with zero drive to perform their role should not be carrying this burden. If someone is joining as a squad, it can be assumed that every member of that squad will want the same objective fulfilled, and so their radio operator is their lifeline for air support, counter-armor combined operations, reinforcements, or updates on other assault lines.  The radio would be an equipment slot item, light enough to be accessible for a rifleman, but heavy enough that not everyone would be lugging one around. The radio operator works as the squad's connection to other units, and can relay information to armor and planes directly, as well as other squad leaders via operators.  Feel free to suggest alternatives to these ideas. I am one person in a sea of many, and nothing I say, or anyone else says, is perfect or even ideal without being tempered in the view of the public eye."
HeroesandGenerals,3d315l,KeystoneGray,2,Mon Jul 13 12:23:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of having to equip a radio and take up slots to talk to the team. I would like some sort of proximity of open voip between all teammates, but even map wide would be vastly better than nothing at all. I would probably favor the traditional CoD style comms considering everything. Just my 2 cents."
HeroesandGenerals,3d315l,b1ghead3d,2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"I will politely attempt to convince you to consider my position.  I must admit, I am not a fan of adding weighted radios either, even as the person suggesting them. Which is why I did not make that suggestion within the first post I made, because I believed (correctly) that it would be too controversial to be as widely accepted as local comms would be. And this is perfectly fine, as I value a rational debate.  Communication between a vast number of players (24+) can fall apart rather quickly without an established figure of respected leadership giving orders. We see this occurring in Planetside public platoons and Arma public servers respectively. However, in both of these games, leadership roles are both clearly defined and come with policing abilities, including rebuking a disruptive or noncooperative player. Such actions would not work within the framework of H&G, as it is a very different game.  As such, the proposed radio system would be the beneficial analog that encourages players to work together, without creating a ""leader"", and without spawning anarchic full team VOIP.  The system I have proposed is a feasible means of limiting communications to a degree by which it would remain useful. When thrown into a room with 24 anonymous players, it is not uncommon for a leadership personality to be ignored for being ""too bossy,"" or for the situation to devolve into discord and spite towards those who aren't performing their given role or helping the objective along.  So, instead...  Build the system around a group of equals.    Everyone participating in the chat has invested a lot into their role. They may better respect each other on this merit alone. With respect comes cooperation. With cooperation comes victory.  Why respect? Because implementing weight narrows the responsibility down to those willing to sacrifice for the good of the team. A player who is unwilling to accept leadership or cooperation is the same sort who would disregard a very heavy piece of communication equipment. On the other hand, a player willing to carry this piece of equipment will be going into battle with five other players who realize that this player is an asset, and will do their best to protect them from the enemy. By virtue of sacrificing for the sake of becoming a team player, this player has the mindset to value of team tactics and coordination. His peers will likely be the same.  H&G is a game with immense potential. Implementing such a system would go a long way toward distinguishing itself among its ""paid"" competitors, like BF/CoD. By doing this, the game would achieve a unique and gratifying twist that further anchors its position as a middle ground between contemporary shooters and strategic simulation."

As a tank driver, you're very aware of the map spotting.. this fleeing infantry would likely have spotted the nearby enemy OR you'll have heard nearby gunfire even possibly taken a few rounds...so you should know to act accordingly."

That way friendlies can get in it and not need me to move to be able to cover infantry with it. Besides, it's ""just"" a car/bike so it's not the end of the world if they get themselves blown up.   For tanks, I have a rule that I'll give you a chance on the machine gun. If you take out infantry, I'll leave those for you and turn you towards them, instead focusing on enemy armor and cars. The second you fire at an enemy tank, I turn around and put you on panzerfaust-protection duty. People don't usually like panzerfaust duty."

No trained sniper should have such a hard time shooting things from 200 meters away.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: this targeted-RNG shit needs to go. You don't see a motorbike stall out from a poor shift, a paratrooper pack their chute wrong, or a gunner reload their weapon incorrectly--so why the fuck would you see a trained sniper not know how to control his breathing and weapon grip?

HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,Vellarius,3,Mon Jul 13 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"Even a trained sniper with the best weapon and the best ammo will still have small variances in shot pattern. This is due to things beyond their control. If you wanted to have a thing where you spend 10 minutes in a position making a range card and getting windage and determining the humidity, and temperature and then calculating and adjusting your scope you would prolly shoot much more accurate. Given that you are able to just plop down prone in a position and say ""oh that guy is 200m away"" adjust range and fire in about 1 second. I would say you are doing well."
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,-3,Sat Jul 11 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, then by that logic we need all vehicles to have gear sticks and paratroopers need to do a minigame where they pack their chute.

Any time people make arguments based on ""realism"" it's a hypocritical argument based on their own personal gameplay preference, otherwise the things that actually go against reality (like lack of inertia in walking movements) would get more attention.  Now, the sniper's sway could be good for gameplay for other reasons, but you're completely right in that arguments that appeal to realism purely for its own sake are largely illogical."
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,RnR4ever,5,Sun Jul 12 02:22:44 2015 UTC,I think many BA players are just too accustomed to the OP scope mechanics prior to the Walker update.  Thus the flow of butthurt.
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,PipeGameLethal,2,Fri Jul 10 16:41:20 2015 UTC,this. I have a OHK and I honestly prefer the new sights as I feel I can be of more use to the team assaulting objectives and for some reason I find it easier with the zoomless ironsights. Too many players miss the days of tree hugging from 300m out dropping people like flies. I'm 110% all for this rebalance. The weapon is still lethal as all hell in the right hands.
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,nerdz0r,0,Fri Jul 10 16:48:25 2015 UTC,We just need a Hold Breath type function.
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,PipeGameLethal,3,Fri Jul 10 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"I would say no, this game would go to shit real fast if every sniper and BA player with a one hit kill had no trouble at all getting the kills.

HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,fernibble,4,Fri Jul 10 17:45:34 2015 UTC,What if we split the difference and have a 'hold breath' that only reduces the sway rather than pretty much eliminating it.  And increased sway for a bit after releasing it.
HeroesandGenerals,3ctbbz,PipeGameLethal,5,Sat Jul 11 00:52:55 2015 UTC,I could definitely get behind that. However reto seems intent on making sniping as close to realistic as possible by making it really difficult to be an ace

HeroesandGenerals,3cudlb,PipeGameLethal,5,Fri Jul 10 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that tier 1 SMG was a godsend to me as a newbie- it wasn't a great weapon, but it made even a brand new player somewhat effective in a battle.   Eventually I wanted an LMG so I built a new character as a rifleman and worked my way up, but a rifleman isn't an easy thing to learn and it certainly shouldn't be forced on every new player.   Previously Reto had a two branched weapons system- Rifleman (which was hard, but branched off into snipers and machineguns) and SMG (which was somewhat easier and branched off into Paratroopers and Pilots/tankers). Forcing people to learn how to be a rifleman right off the bat is going to push a lot of people away from the game."

HeroesandGenerals,3cudlb,spansic,-2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"if your issue is capping points, the freebee first objective is generally just as fast on a bike.  Reason:  Jeep takes longer to spawn than just a rifleman. By the time a jeep spawned, you and your bike are already on the way to the objective (probably 15% to it).  you and the jeep driver should arrive at the same time.  ALSO NOTE: jeeps are LOUD and easy to spot, so while you get there faster, you'll also be spotted, and die faster.  Granted if you ABSOLUTELY need a jeep, then they grind is there (civ trucks), but its nothing new."

It's not about whether it's possible to cap objectives or play the game with a new character, it's that new people joining the game have to wait a long, long time before they can get the basic Quality of Life perks that veteran players get. Yes you can bike to every objective, but it's not fun.

HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,spacemanbasics,6,Sat Jul 11 01:41:13 2015 UTC,Currently on my phone and I'll be back to offer my 2 cents as I'm kind of on the fence. However I will say there have been times where I have my bazooka/shriek/nades and I'm standing next to a tank and choose to let it live because I didn't want to lose the credits (such as an absolute stomp).
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:14:38 2015 UTC,one option should be to increase the cost to use said tanks. if we can eliminate their abilities to just spam their shells then they will pick out their targets much more carefully (similar to how they reduced th shriek spamming)
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,Double0Dixie,4,Mon Jul 13 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"I cannot see how it is anything but bad game balance when a perfectly executed attack that will help your team to victory leads to an overall loss in credits. A player should not be punished for using any weapon. If a weapon is OP in the main part of the game, it should not be nerfed in the metagame. That makes no sense. It just makes it so that most players can no longer use it while people who are willing to spend a fuckton of RL money on it have it just as OP as before. I'm pretty sure that would be called P2W.  What should be done is make it less OP in the main part of the game, be that by changing the actual stats of it, reducing the ammo capacity, or maybe even limit the amount of uses per match. Just something to make it so that players can actually use the weapon without absolutely dominating the match.  Killing an enemy and helping your team should be satisfying, that is what keeps players coming back. When you feel like crap when you are forced to use a certain weapon to kill an enemy, that is fucking bad. It leads to frustration, and people don't like to play games that leave them frustrated. Shit like that is why I don't really play the game that much any more and just watch this sub in case stuff changes for the better."
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,mud074,3,Sat Jul 11 04:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with you there, camping tanks still are a big issue.  Yesterday we were spawn camped on A line on Factories again by a few tanks. The rage levels were high. Chat was ablaze with complains and the rage quitting and constant stream of new connections was also noticeable.  I spent 25 minutes in the battle. Died about 14 times, made about 2 kills. All in all my repair costs were about 600 and I made 3000ish. It was profitable...but I only shot about 20 bullets.   Why am I telling you this....  See, what happens in these situations is two things.. people quit and people don't play properly.  I ignored the tanks in the end....why waste my money on a match that the team doesn't even try to win?  The vast majority of people simply disconnected and joined a new match.  It is apparently clear that tanks camping are OP (yes I know tank operators will complain about this statement). To counteract this the best system would be much higher rewards for tank destruction and possible immobility of tanks when heavily damaged (you still have repair option, getting you out of a tank and giving the assault team time to get back to that location is the game balance).  Also, mortars at the end of tank destruction ribbon would assist in long range tank eradication."
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,hemansteve,3,Sat Jul 11 02:52:04 2015 UTC,The HE spam is what I find absurd from tankers. They get enough shells to completely turn some objectives into no man's land
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:03:15 2015 UTC,I can agree with the immobilization or at least a system where you can damage different parts of the tank and get different affects (like tracking or ammo racking ) but if there were to be any extra rewards except the one where you actually destroy the tank it would have to me minimal otherwise (as I've stated in my previous comment to OP ) either tanks or infantry would become null and void.

HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,TeleVue,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"I play both tanker and infantry, so I'll weigh in here.  From an infantry's perspective:  I routinely destroy tanks with stickies and still go positive. That being said, I also don't routinely hunt tankers. I will not destroy all 40 tanks in an AT (except when they're GringoJS' tanks...). One or two destroyed tanks will open up an area long enough to cap a point. Also, when a tanker is killed, he will likely not hang around an area where he previously died. You don't have to kill every tank in the match to win.   Also, if you're not using a high level character (7-8+), you will lose money. Try making one of your higher level chars your dedicated anti-tank. And, even if you lose money one match, there is nothing stopping you from grinding credits with another character with a couple skirmishes. I understand that a particularly long match will leave me in the red, so I spend the next couple matches grinding credits.  From a tanker's perspective- From far away and in a good position, I'm a king. That's not a result of OP equipment; that's simply better gameplay. Similarly, a player in a good position on a cap point will absolutely dominate. Teamwork and coordination are good counter-measures for good gameplay, but even then they're not fool proof.   However, a bad tanker will be easy to kill, and, if they're really bad, you might not even have to kill them. They'll put themselves in positions where they are easily flanked, or have little visibility, or  just otherwise screw themselves.  Overall opinion- A good player will be a good tanker. A good tanker will kill you regardless."
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,mickdude2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:59:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. I don't think tanks should be nerfed at all. I don't play them much so I couldn't weigh in on that discussion although I do hear a lot of grumblings about certain factions having worse tanks that could use a buff.  I don't think that people playing effectively and contributing to team wins should be mutually exclusive with gaining credits. That's my only point and I believe that increasing the reward from destroying tanks to be slightly higher than the price of the AT required would be appropriate without nerfing tankers.
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,Daffan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:38:57 2015 UTC,also its annoying as fuck  spawning a tank  shooting enemy tank 2 times  and someone last hits it and u get 2xp  L O L
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"As being both a tanker and having a soldier devoted to anti tank... if AT was any cheaper to use, tanks would become useless. And if AT was anymore expensive to use it would turn into Warthunder. So having experience on both sides of the fence puts my final opinion that the pricing is ok. Not the best but ok so that tanks can be left in the game alongside air and infantry."
HeroesandGenerals,3cv9h6,WarCraft518,-2,Mon Jul 13 12:02:29 2015 UTC,Yea.. Tanks are overpowered.. but not the tier ones with just the machine guns! I think they are balanced or maybe underpowered! Just my opinion! :D

HeroesandGenerals,3ctmrf,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"Okay! Under that logic, let's go ahead and make the game realistic by giving the same damage for Stg. 44, G43, and Kar 98k.  Realism is an overrated concept in a video game. It's clear by your flair that you're really biased about this, and I'm not expecting to change your mind on this topic, but I just wanted to tell you why you're wrong for the benefit of everyone else."
HeroesandGenerals,3ctmrf,KeystoneGray,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"While I get your point I don't think you said it very well.   I'd say that absurd damage values are just compensation for reduced situational awareness. Obviously in real life, just one or two hits, at that time and in those conditions, is going to kill you, severely would of you're lucky. However, WWII soldiers had their actual senses telling them what was going on. Full peripheral view, more accurate positional audio, etc. So games make up for that by letting us have a ""warning shot"" so we know how to defend ourselves."
HeroesandGenerals,3ctmrf,TangibleLight,0,Thu Jul 16 14:03:03 2015 UTC,"It's clear by your flair that you're really biased about this   How, exactly, does that make it ""clear"" at all?  If you're going to open with a character assassination, the least you should do is scour my history and find out if it's true. I've argued for buffs and nerfs in every single class this game has to offer. I'm best at sniping and I have the most fun with it when I am trying to push the limits of my ability (shooting people from over a half-mile away), which is why I have the flair. But do I let my preference get in the way? Fuck no. Why would I want to make my favorite class easier? I don't want more snipers flooding the games.  What I do want is to game on an even playing field. No other class has to deal such a transparent and contrived attempt at entirely negating snipers so that the new players can continue to play badly without punishment (and go on to spend lots of money on gold). I take issue with that, which is why I've been outspoken on most of the ""newbie friendly"" changes that take place in this game. No game should be balanced around a demographic that is statistically guaranteed to diminish in size compared to all others.   I just wanted to tell you why you're wrong for the benefit of everyone else.   Actually, no, I'm not. But since you brought this up, let's explore how woefully wrong you are:  The STG exclusively used ammunition with 1/3 the foot-pound force of the ammo both the G43 and the Kar 98k used. Its ammunition also traveled at about 135 m/s slower than the ammunition for the G43 and the Kar 98k. Now, I'm not great with math, but I'm pretty sure that will have a serious impact on the hole size each of them leaves.  Then there's the difference between the G43 and the Kar 98k, which is about 200 meters between their effective firing ranges. Again, not great at math, but I'm guessing that kind of difference would have an effect on engagement ranges.  And by the way: I wasn't even arguing for increased realism in the game (you can, in fact, check my comment history and see that I am generally against a lot of ""realism"" additions to H&G). I was pointing out that Reto doesn't seem to have either realism or game balance in mind with their development decisions--which I find suspect.  I just just wanted to tell you why you're wrong because you're an asshole. I couldn't care less about most of the fucks in this sub. The community went to shit the moment all those Youtube refugees came in from the numerous ""lol, watch me kill my teammates"" videos."

I warned everyone of the problems associated with nerfing snipers first, and then adding additional scopes for other guns. I warned of the dangers associated with making too many nerfs/buffs at the same time for all the classes. I pointed out how the changes were very peculiar in that they were balanced purely for low-level play. Every time, I was downvoted, insulted, and/or mocked.  Now every match is a bunch of people hiding behind rocks or in the shadows, cradling a scoped semi-auto, and missing 90% of their shots."
HeroesandGenerals,3ctmrf,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:41 2015 UTC,"I like the new scopes, though I haven't used them myself and I hear there are some things to fix with them (something about colors and/or blurriness). They're better this way; it's changed from where the scopes used to have the same field of view and everything as the binoculars (e.g. scopes now have a realistically longer eye relief). Certainly some praise is deserved for the work on the scopes.  There is no problem with allowing players to skip progression if they have the money, because everybody is capable of getting the same equipment with time.  It's true what you said about Heavy Set, so I've stopped using my Kar98K on my German infantry in favor of the Gewehr 43 (Edit: I'm also going to try using a C96 alongside my Karabiner and binoculars). I would do the same on the US, but the Garand doesn't have a realistic iron sight, which would be easier to use and not as ugly.  Oddly, the M1 carbine has a realistic iron sight while the M1 Garand does not. reto pls  Edit: Picture of an M1 Garand rear sight that was posted in an Imgur album to /r/guns about an hour ago: http://i.imgur.com/TFxafEF.jpg  If only this game had Arma's hold-right-click-to-zoom that simulates how our eyes actually work, the realistic iron sights would work well."

Some guns like the K98 have ridiculously bad ironsights that need a fix in order to restore usefulness.  Mosin Nagant doesn't have this problem.  I'm not asking for zoom, just better sights.  In fact I love not having magic zoom on iron sights.  It is more authentic and it makes semi-autos and the BAR so much better."

HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,poorlyexecutedjab,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Soviets still don't have anything, be glad you at least have a t2 lmg and pistol as well as the STG"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,9,Thu Jul 9 18:00:43 2015 UTC,The PPSH is a fucking beast!
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Fababo,3,Thu Jul 9 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"PPSH is godly up close, but it has shitty damage and accuracy past around 30 metres, whereas the STG is precise and hard hitting. Also, the sights on the STG make for easy sniping.  PPSH is very good, but is outperformed at a range by the STG"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,2,Thu Jul 9 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"make for easy sniping   Assuming the bullet goes where you're pointed. Closer than 50m it seems alright, but past that I've found it hard to hit anything."
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,TangibleLight,2,Thu Jul 9 21:46:41 2015 UTC,Yeah single shot under 50m is pretty good. Wiped a dozen of guys in the new airfield map like that
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Cubano07,3,Thu Jul 9 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not complaining. I still like my k98 and nodded mp40. But my weapon of choice is Christopher Walken, then the M2 Carbine. I don't care for the Soviet weapons for the reasons you mentioned, although the nodded Mosin is great too."

HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,mayor676,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:15:10 2015 UTC,PTRD? PPSH?  This thing basically has unlimited ammo...  Best unmodded SA in the game?  Have you even played the other factions?
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,plaidpilgrim,4,Thu Jul 9 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"Yes the SVT is good. I am not disagreeing with you, the PPSH is very good, HOWEVER, it struggles to hit anything above 50 metres.  The PTRD is niche, struggles to pierce most armour and you're better off with a OHK rifle or smg as infantry.  Also, yes, I have played all 3 factions, my soviet is lowest level (9) but I have unlocked all the weapons for him. Also I have a soviet pilot"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:19:56 2015 UTC,At the beginning of any war it's a real struggle to move against the soviets with the PTDR.   They kill tons of people in cars with it and snipe like pros
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Cubano07,3,Thu Jul 9 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, 1028 rounds/minute and relatively powerful (compared to an SMG). I've tried the scope and, to be honest its not a great improvement, sure you can see further and more clearly but the rifle is not really accurate enough at long range even without mods that reduce the precision and stability. Also the fact that the scope blurs your peripheral vision makes a big difference.  I love the rifle but don't really care for the scope, or the reticle.  I'm not sure they will nerf it myself, the STG44 seems at least as good (for different reasons), I don't think German players can really complain. Its the Soviets that I feel for but I'm sure they'll get some goodies soon enough"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,GreatSageEoH,3,Thu Jul 9 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"I really hope the soviet side gets some new weapons, It's no fun getting destroyed by STG's when you just have a mosin or a PPSH"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"Well, all the Germans that I've been playing with in staged matches since the update sure have been whining on in-game chat about the M1/M2 carbine..."
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,plaidpilgrim,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Good to hear, maybe that'll balance out the whining by U.S. players about the MG42"
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Fababo,3,Fri Jul 10 13:05:27 2015 UTC,I think the Fallschirmjägergewehr and STG-44 balance the gun pretty good.
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,RealityAskew,2,Thu Jul 9 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the M2 but damned I'm loving my STG44 with scope.  Tight Grip gold helps though.  As a note I actually removed some of the mods, since all they did was increase rate of fire but decreased stability."
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah the STG is godly in the right hands, excellent up close, as well as very good from a distance with the selective fire."
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,PipeGameLethal,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Once the Germans start crying like they always do about something it will get whacked by the nerf hammer. All it's gonna take is a few STG-44 users to get beat a couple times or outplayed for them to start. Enjoy it while it lasts I guess...
HeroesandGenerals,3cp0ne,RealityAskew,6,Thu Jul 9 17:41:52 2015 UTC,LOL do I sense some anti-German bias here? ;)

HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,sak_14,3,Thu Jul 9 21:03:46 2015 UTC,I love the new zoom. It makes leading easier for me and I get better KDRs now with my 1903. I went 28 and 7 a day or two ago on airfield.
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,TommyT223,6,Fri Jul 10 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"This is permanent. And a think it makes sense, you're not a super human with super vision. They just made the zoom realistic so that scopes would be useful."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,Zackory,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:36:09 2015 UTC,In the same token it will be what makes the game scopes r us.
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,woohooguy,2,Fri Jul 10 02:09:39 2015 UTC,"Scopes have a limited field of view. They give clarity at longer ranges, but you have less awareness of your surroundings.  Fair trade off."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,RnR4ever,2,Fri Jul 10 05:41:35 2015 UTC,"This has made OHK rifles even worse now. If you don't have a OHK rifle you need to place 2 or 3 accurate shots minimum. At range its very difficult to get a headshot since the character model is small to begin with...at close range its pretty tough too because your gun and sight obscures 50 to 60 percent of your sight picture...even more if your aiming high for the head. A guy with a one shot just needs to land a shot the the chest...its much easier to land one shot center mass than 2 or 3...and way easier than to the head.  There are one shots everywhere now..before the update Id run into one every now and then, every 4 or 5 games maybe. After the update there is at least one per match, that's gotta say something."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,loki993,4,Mon Jul 13 12:41:42 2015 UTC,I think it is bullshit that Reto would accept payments for players to progress their weapons to where they are happy then nurf all the guns and offer payments for modifications to bring them back to where they were.  Scumbag Reto.
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,hemansteve,0,Thu Jul 9 23:45:36 2015 UTC,I'll never understand what people are crying about now. They take away the ability for people to buy some guns outright and hike u the price a stupid amount (takes retards amounts of cash to get the STG right now). If someone wants to spend hundreds on one ribbon who cares? Spend the day or two grinding skirmishes to get the credits to do the same and quit complaining.
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you /u/PipeGameLethal. The Walker change made the game much more well balanced, and made the game MORE accessible for non-gold players!  Take veteran badge for example. Previously, you had to pay gold for it. Don't have gold? Too fucking bad you dont get to use a second badge. Players paying real-world money has an non-substitutable edge over non-paying players.  Now? You can use in-game credits to buy veteran badge. AFAIK everything you can pay gold for, you can earn or buy with in-game credits.  How is that ""bullshit""? Reto made it LESS pay-to-win."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,RnR4ever,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:49 2015 UTC,"You are both distracting from my original comment.   People made payments to Reto for a product. That product's specifications were then nurfed and systems of further payments now required to regain the same/similar specifications (eg. needing a scope when previously a BA was enough). Sure you could earn it all over again, but that isn't the motivating factor for why Reto did it. They knew that if you wanted to keep enjoying the game right now to the same level you used to you will have to pay Gold. Otherwise, keep grinding to get back to where you were. If this wasn't the case we would have received refunds / concessions to purchase scopes at a discount.   It's a plain old money grab dressed in tinsel."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,hemansteve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:06:39 2015 UTC,"Let me see if I am getting you straight:   People made payments to Reto for a product. That product's specifications were then nurfed and systems of further payments now required to regain the same/similar specifications    and    They knew that if you wanted to keep enjoying the game right now to the same level you used to you will have to pay Gold.     So people who have been ""paying to win"" have to ""repay again"" to keep restore their ""pay to win"" advantage. But now non-paying players can achieve the same advantage, therefore it's not cool.   I guess I can see why you'd be mad if you were under the expectation where you only had to ""pay once"" and have the advantages permanently bought. But to my experience, any type of MMO games require periodic rebalance. I hear from the other thread https://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesandGenerals/comments/3cq9h4/i_got_a_refund_from_this_july_9_hotfix/ that people are getting refunds when filing tickets. You should give that a shot.  I think bottom line, /u/PipeGameLethal and my point is that, the game mechanics arguably improved with this update, making the game much more dynamic to play. This is certainly a win for all players, paying or non-paying."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,RnR4ever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I mean. I have friends who now want to come back to the game after I told them about the new system. You can't outright buy weapons anymore without buying the progression that goes along with it. This means far less brand new players in Heavy tanks screwing the team over in staged and wasting ATs in war. I support the ideology of paying in this game that reto emphasized this morning:  You don't pay to win in this game, you pay to save time. If you want something it's one or the other.  This update was a very positive step for p2p vs. f2p player balancing.  However I do sympathize with those who feel cheated by paying for what they thought would be a one time deal but a rebalance was definitely needed."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a bad patch. There are many features that are excellent, but there are also many disadvantages to players that have not left positive impressions."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,hemansteve,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am not a fan of that change at all. I also don't like the ""more realistic"" argument in video games as video games should be about maximizing the entertainment value of the game and shouldn't sacrifice that for realism. However, it's a change that affects everybody equally and is obviously to make scopes a little more useful."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,spacemanbasics,3,Thu Jul 9 23:15:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was more to limit the power of one shot kill Bolt Action rifles. The zoom essentially made them a sniper rifles for infantrymen. Now to see further out in the distance, you'll need a scope."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,TeleVue,3,Thu Jul 9 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"IMO, the more realistic, the better. This isn't COD. It makes a game more immersive."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,CheeseRat12,2,Fri Jul 10 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"To some degree yeah. I won't really consider this game great until they fix outrageous things like people teleporting into and out of vehicles, and being able to dive off of speeding motorcycles and start firing accurately within 2 and a half seconds. These are the real problems with regard to realism."
HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,TraditionalProgester,2,Fri Jul 10 08:59:17 2015 UTC,Not to forget when you get off a motorbike your character hops off the left side but you spawn on the right side.

HeroesandGenerals,3cpz82,CheeseRat12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a decision based on realism.  They wanted to add more scopes in the game, so pulling back iron sights zoom to more realistic levels was necessary for them to add a variety of new scopes.  Scopes are a big money maker for them apparently."
HeroesandGenerals,3collq,woohooguy,3,Thu Jul 9 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"Biggest take away here is custom ammo.   All weapon ammo has been set to default, you need to reslot custom ammo on your weapons, possibly vehicles.   /FYI   Edit - I just looked over all my weapons, the custom ammo is still slotted on all my tanks so this only affects guns."

HeroesandGenerals,3cntev,Zackory,4,Thu Jul 9 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"It does overperform any SMG at mid range. However compare it with MP-40 (your counterpart before Walker), under 20 meters STG is inferior to it. STG's recoil is much worse. And at 20m+ STG is inferior to MG-42.  It's just another combination of range/TTK parameters with new shiny glow."

And keep in mind that the soviet faction is still kinda new, and most (is not all) of the soviet weapons were added before the soviet update, so you know they are working on something new for the ole' russien dudes on the battle field."

The best thing they could do is to add a fictional lend-lease scenario between the US and RU involving the BAR    Re handgun: they could probably add a revolver, similar to the M1917, most likely the Nagant M1895 (a tad old but still trusty).   It's kind of hard for the devs, mainly because the russians made few guns that were sturdy enough; meaning they didn't have to innovate very much"
HeroesandGenerals,3cm5er,hemansteve,2,Wed Jul 8 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone post this crap every update...

HeroesandGenerals,3cm5er,PipeGameLethal,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"I know right.  Before update: Paying gold = you can get an advantage non-paying players cannot get (i.e., veteran badge). While not un-winnable without the extra badge, it is by definition a ""pay-to-win"" unfair game mechanics.  After update: Paying gold just shortens your grind from 2 weeks to instantaneously. That isn't ""pay-to-win"". That is the proper way of doing a freemium game with a balanced game mechanics.  So far all the complaints I have seen are ""Wahhh I no longer can sit and sniper everyone in the game and troll. I actually need to play tactically and it's not fun cause I can't kill reliably"".

Don't get me wrong, play as you want, but considering it was titled, Walker Update, it doesn't accurately show the difficulty in hitting targets well beyond 500 meters.   Considering these weapons are completely capable of destroying a man with 1 shot at 1000 meters or 0.621371 freedom units, that's what the rifle should be programmed for.   At present sway is so bad that making shots over 5-600 meters becomes a matter of economical risk. Do you continue to battle bullet drop, player momentum, drunken Parkinson's disease (sway) to hit targets you are supposed to be hitting or just play up close like you just did so you don't go broke.

All you need to really understand now is war missions are set up by officers and Generals moving resources around the map so battles can be quite unfair at times, yet every single war mission has an impact on the war with each win or loss.   The wars become quite unstable in the periods after major new releases so don't take this current time period as the norm, it's the exception.   Generally wars are stable and run 14 days+ but with new releases and current politics.. Yes there are many, many politics involved in this game, the war can get repetitive, unpredictable, pathetic, and flat out broke at times.   This is one of those times so take war missions in stride.   Also note what type of unit you are trying to use in war missions.  Infantry queue the fastest as they are the most common units available. Tanks and paras are very expensive to deploy in war and as such not so common.. Queue as a tank in war and it will be a long winter."

Then, at the end, they throw on some music and let the whole gameplay video run uninterrupted.  Just some ideas.  Your skill is what attracts me at the moment.

HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,camcantrun,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"See I dont think its more balanced..I think they messed up the balance actually....with the no scope rifles for example...theyre nearly impossible to use for medium range engagements, theyre only usable for CQB right now which is something they still dont do well.    They also ruined the pace of play"
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,camcantrun,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"My bruthuh, I get it bolt action got nerfed. Good, with a bolt action rifle you ain't gonna be hitting 200 meter shots in ww2 anyways...  I don't understand how the pace was effected, but... all in all.. play the game how you like, if you don't like BA rifles now, don't use em. :P  My man,..... that sniper HAD TO BE NERFED. Myself and many other players were dropping people from across the map like nothing over and over.... something had to be done."
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,camcantrun,2,Wed Jul 8 23:12:24 2015 UTC,The pace of play is slower because people are camping in the bushes with OHK bolt actions and you have to take a lot more time to aim your shots now with most guns.   You say recon had to be nerfed but all that's going to happen is they will be replaced by infantry guys with OHK rifles with scopes. Sure they dont zoom as much but lets be honest here you dont need 8x zoom in the game anyway. I havent used it myself but people are saying that the low zoom scopes also have a ton less sway. So you make it harder for a recon to snipe then a regular infantry....  I think they could have balanced the game just fine by taking away the OHK rifles ability to do a OHK...I mean that seems simple to me....that makes sense.
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,TangibleLight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:17:50 2015 UTC,It's all relative to each individuals play style; )  We just have different points of view.
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,fernibble,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"True, I tend to like to play aggressively so being able to acquire a target and aim quickly is essential for that....the new zoom on the irons makes it pretty tough to place accurate shots."
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,mickdude2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:01:15 2015 UTC,"A tip for SA rifles in CQC: particularly with how the ironsights zoom has been nerfed, don't bother using ironsights on enemies closer than ~5m. At that distance, the cone of fire gives a relatively low chance to miss, and you'll save about 1/2 a second before shooting. If nothing else, fire once or twice, then use the iron sights.   This of course does not apply to all situations. If you're going for headshots then ignore this completely."
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,Heatbeat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:43:49 2015 UTC,Well headshots with the new sights are more luck than skill at this point.   I am doing that though and managed to 1 v 4 some germans...they couldnt have been happy about that.
HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,armyrope115,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"I can still pull off 200m shots with the iron sights sometimes.  Just not as easily as before.  I am no expert, but I think that hitting a target the size of a head from 200m with ironsights like they had on the real guns was far from easy.  I think the BA rifles are well suited for 50 - 200 m range which I believe is fairly 'medium' range.  Under 25m is tricky.  I was attracted to this game over others because there is more strategy.  I don't need the game to be at a furious pace all the time.  There are a plethora of run-and-gun games out there but not nearly as many as what HG is shaping up to be.  I hope they keep on this track.  I like that if I have BA and miss or only wound on the first shot that I don't have to worry about my target pulling his pistol and headshotting me from 100+m with the quick-draw and accuracy skills of a mythical gunslinger from the old Western movies."

HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,oxtra,3,Wed Jul 8 22:25:14 2015 UTC,Ive heard this multilple times....if they basically ruined the sights on nearly every gun in the game to balance the OHK rifles then its about the silliest way to balance a weapon that Ive ever seen. If you want to get rid of OHK rifles get rid of OHK rifles...dont ruin the experience form anyone else that plays to do it.

HeroesandGenerals,3ckmoe,camcantrun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:06 2015 UTC,You say that but then they give everyone scopes and the ability to buy their way to them if the want and the buy their way to a OHK BA rifle any infantry can use. I honestly think it will get worse not better now that everyone can either grind to a scope or buy one. Also the grind for the gun levels doesn't seem that bad its going pretty fast on mine. Not that I have a problem with that mind you.   I am not exaggerating that I've been killed by more OHK BA rifles in the days since the update came down then the entire month and a half I played the game before...and I've been playing a lot less lately...

He got hes chance for one shot me and even if he did, next time I can suprise him in this midrange enviroment. But running 300 meters on open field and 100 meters up to the hill when recon got me like on fork its just mad and blind luck for me. And i was never lucky with good snipers who got good awerness.

HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,6mexicans,3,Wed Jul 8 04:18:50 2015 UTC,I'm in the middle of my first round as a Recon with the new build. The sway is plain old FUCKED. If you go prone you still have sway and the game bugs out with constant zooming in and out if you are on the slightest slope. That leaves you as a recon only shooting prone of perfectly flat surfaces. Reto has ruined this role. Needs an immediate hot fix to nurf the sway.
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,hemansteve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:28:12 2015 UTC,"If you use a factory standard sniper rifle, there is practically no sway but you'll have to hit your target multiple times. If you use an OHK sniper rifle, you can kill your target in one shot (unless they have heavy set on) but the sway is ridiculous. You have to pick your poison."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,M4rcato,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"I pretty much never go prone as recon. If you crouch, the sway is just barely manageable with a little practice. Try going into a staged battle and practice keeping the sights on a window or bush or something. Don't shoot at anything, just work at counteracting the sway.   Also, if you're low on health or stamina or if you've just turned faster than about 1 rotation/sec then sway is temporarily increased.  That said, it does need a buff. Making it harder to snipe isn't balancing out snipers. It's making the game needlessly difficult."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,TangibleLight,2,Wed Jul 8 04:46:46 2015 UTC,"If you are prone your gun shouldn't move. In crouched I should be easily able to focus on targets head at 100m. At the moment, a crouched shot at anything over 250 is pretty much good timing and luck. What the fuck was the point in including stability as a mod option if the gun is going to behave like a light saber. Immediate hot fix needed for Recons, hopefully this is just temporary to harvest Gold out of players before they go to final settings."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,hemansteve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well there needs to be some challenge in hitting at range. A little sway is almost necessary to keep the game fun for the riflemen on the other team, and to filter out the people who don't want to put that much effort into changing their playstyle - if everyone's sniping nothing gets done.   I would suggest just lower sway for the ""rest"" state. Perhaps virtually no sway if you have full health, stamina, have been prone for >45 seconds, and are using a BA, SA, or AT rifle. You shouldn't be able to hop around from cover to cover and still get it easy - nor should this apply to SMGs, automatic rifles, or assault rifles. Maybe LMGs if they add working tripods. Gameplay should always trump realism IMO."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,TangibleLight,3,Wed Jul 8 05:09:01 2015 UTC,"There already are plenty of challenges. There's the need to lead your target. Then there's the challenge of compensating for bullet drop (since auto-zoom is in 100 meter increments). Beyond that is the challenge of not being spotted (something other classes don't have to worry about nearly as much, if at all).  Outside of those three are the usual challenges that all other classes face. Adding an RNG mechanic is just unnecessary for sniper balance; the noobs just need to learn how to use cover. Instead Reto balanced the game for new players (a flawed design choice only ever utilized in F2P games), so they could rake in more cash from the terribads who would normally throw a shitfit and quit within 3 hours of playing.  It wouldn't even be so bad if prone worked properly, and it wouldn't be an issue at all if prone and crouch had a more realistic effect on sway. I mean, seriously, we're talking about a trained sniper class--having a shaky grip is already retarded.  TL;DR You don't see the tank drivers occasionally grinding gears, or paratroopers pack their chute incorrectly. You don't see a gunner load their LMG the wrong way. The idea of a sniper (of all classes) being prone and experiencing an even mildly challenging passive sway at 200 meters is ludicrous."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Wed Jul 8 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"That I can accept and actually see as fair. What is shitting me the most is that the Recon should be able to take out players that just render in on the map, that is kind of their job, long range spotting and shot placement. This has become near impossible with the current sway and bugs associated with laying prone on sloping surfaces.  Edit: This current sway model will only encourage Aimbot cheats."
HeroesandGenerals,3ciduo,hemansteve,5,Wed Jul 8 05:12:27 2015 UTC,"The worst thing for me is the reload animation, you can no longer see the impact of your shot, so leading a target now is impossible!"

I simply can't stomach another 2 month grind for items I already unlocked. And losing 170k of credits on a sniper to be taken off me is a joke.  Hopefully I'll play the game again when they sort it all out.
HeroesandGenerals,3cinoj,David375,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:15:57 2015 UTC,As a person that mains the PTRD I think I'm allowed to say that rpm doesn't matter. Due to it being a single shot weapon and you reload after each shot the only thing that would make it faster is the badge that speeds up reload because it speeds up the animation.
HeroesandGenerals,3cinoj,12349pie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:08:32 2015 UTC,thank for that. Gonna be pounding out SMG kills for that fast reload badge until my guy is the fastest PTRD'er on the Bloc.

HeroesandGenerals,3cht35,6mexicans,2,Wed Jul 8 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"I'm loving the changes so far as a German player.    Our tanks now stand a decent chance against other factions.  STG-44 is pretty cool. Haven't tried the scopes yet. It has needle like iron sights btw. Less zoom when aiming down sights. It nerfs Bolt Actions from killing you and also gets a bit realistic.  You can buy vet with IN GAME CREDITS. To purchase a Heavy Tank, you have to throw a shit ton of money in the ribbons. You're looking at like $100+ to get a Tiger II. This means less noobs buying a Tiger II and wasting Heavy Tank Assault Teams. EVERYTHING can can be purchased with credits. Not everyone has a scope. I actually haven't seen any non-sniper scopes yet. Select fire for a few guns.   I'm actually quite happy for this update.   Only thing I don't like is that many of the academy trained soldiers are rather cheap."
HeroesandGenerals,3cht35,TeleVue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"It took me a little bit to figure out how to play with my MP40 with the new zoom mechanics, but it clicked this afternoon. I actually like this update because it's essentially forces me to learn how to hip-fire and not rely on the zoom.  Also as I've gotten used to the new scope effects I've decided that I like them. It's quite a bit different that it used to be but I think it's nice to look at and doesn't mess with gameplay too bad. Note that this is only on a BA rifle, I haven't put scopes on anything else yet.  Can't wait to buy myself an STG, though. I've picked a few up and played with them and it's pretty sweet. Ditto for the M1/M2."

HeroesandGenerals,3cgs5j,TangibleLight,3,Wed Jul 8 05:54:51 2015 UTC,"I've played all 3 factions and have to say I prefer Germans.  One  of the main reasons is that the player base seems to have less of the dipshit factor.  I'll qualify the remark regarding the term dipshit.  In this game a dipshit in my opinion is the jackass who team kills (TKs), stands at a spawn point shooting into the air for hours, runs around an objective (those things that start with the letter ""O"") but never goes inside to take it, leaves a spawn even when it's being taken (happens all the time), drives past a guy engaging 3 enemies without rendering assistance, stands next to me when I'm trying to snipe, etc. etc.  That having been said, I'm concerned that the release of the Walker update and the STG44 might cause an influx of those afflicted with dipshititis to the German side."

I've played a few matches over the last few days in my German light armor toon, and I'll say they are much more organized, strategic, and effective on average.   I actually had infantry support for my little tank brigade I was running with, and the lead tanker gave orders and ideas on how to solve complex situations.   I also had several infantry guys save me from death at the hands of STs and H3s, and I saved them from the Soviet/American armor. It was a nice little system that gave us the win on almost all of the maps.  So personally, I have to give it to Germany. It's just more fun than having infantry scrambling everywhere shooting tanks with their starter rifles and throwing frags at them and tanks who think they are indestructible only to be immediately killed off, wasting resources."

HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,Leto2k,3,Tue Jul 7 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"We had a mechanic where you could hold down the fire button and that would keep the sight in place (delaying the chamber event), but that didn't feel very natural. We might move the scope closer and reduce the motion in the chamber animation for the proper sniper rifles instead."
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,HiroSS,2,Wed Jul 8 08:25:01 2015 UTC,Yes do that! I agree that sniping before the patch was a little( just a little) bit easy. But the patch nerfed it too much. Not being able to see you impact shots is just stupid. And i feel that like 30-40% of my shots that i know i hit a non moving target do not register. But i'm not sure. I'm gonna record acouple of matches and play them in slow motion to see if it is something i'm doing wrong or if it is the game...
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,Leto2k,5,Wed Jul 8 11:40:12 2015 UTC,I have tweaked the centering of the scoped rifles with chamber animations so it stays almost in the center of the screen. It will hit live within a few days with the next hotfix.
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,6mexicans,2,Wed Jul 8 12:36:59 2015 UTC,Thank you Leto!  And thanks for watching the Reddit for our feedback. :)
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,loki993,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:55:01 2015 UTC,"On this note, I was going to mention this today, but does anyone else feel like the hit box is really off now?  I mean I was shooting center mass at 100m from a concealed position against stationary targets and not getting hits.  It was bizarre.  Anyone else seeing this?"
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,loki993,2,Wed Jul 8 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"This is my biggest beef.  The tracer is a huge part of my gameplay.  I don't mind it getting harder, but this is absurd."
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,Zackory,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:32 2015 UTC,Exactly so if you miss you have no idea how to compensate..its a total guess.
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,loki993,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:44:05 2015 UTC,So more reason to just throw a scope on a Garand and call it good then?
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,william1134,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:44 2015 UTC,Actually an interesting fact I'm playing with now.  The ST44 has a 4x scope and can fire single shot.  With Tight Grip you can almost eliminate the recoil and the sight picture never really changes.  I've got to play with it more but this could be really nice. :)
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,Zackory,3,Tue Jul 7 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call this nice, i'd personally call it broken. OP if you may."
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,william1134,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah so makes recon...less essential. I've thought the same thing though. Most encounters are at a relativity close range, so a SA rifle with a low power scope could actually be better than a sniper rifle in a lot of situations. Headshot kills regardless or a quick doubletap if I happen to miss. I'm definitely looking forward to making my own M1D.   Ive also heard that the low power scopes have a ton less sway......which if true give you even less reason to use a recon."
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,Cubano07,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:40:04 2015 UTC,oooooh boy is it true.  I bought the STG44 with scope and upgraded LMG ribbon to Tight Grip gold.  This thing is a beast!  Yes there's almost no recoild on semi-auto mode and I was able to put insane amounts of lead downrange in short order.  Can't wait to give it a try on the home system.
HeroesandGenerals,3cfskv,TeleVue,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:02 2015 UTC,Not as impressed when I got home but can't maybe I just need to get used to it.

HeroesandGenerals,3cff24,loki993,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:41:55 2015 UTC,"No you wont be able to upgrade it...only recons can upgrade scoped rifles.    This is incorrect since the last update. Scope is an upgrade to a rifle, and anyone who can equip rifles can upgrade them with a scope or anything else.  Recon characters have an advantage as they can use scopes with better magnification.  Read the article here."
HeroesandGenerals,3cff24,Satarash,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:36:45 2015 UTC,He specifically asked about the scoped sniper rifle you unlock at level 12 though..that one you cant upgrade as infantry.  Yes you are correct though you can upgrade a regular BA rifle and put a scope on it now. as gamebreaking as that seems to be.
HeroesandGenerals,3cff24,loki993,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"He asked about a ribbon that doesn't exist anymore, and a weapon that doesn't exist anymore. Scoped rifles are not separate weapons, they are just regular rifles upgraded with a scope.  At least that's my understanding (I don't have a recon soldier to check)."
HeroesandGenerals,3cff24,Satarash,2,Tue Jul 7 17:23:38 2015 UTC,I think its just for infantry but I'm really not sure. I do have a recon but I'm at work so I haven't been in the game to see any of the new changes.   I guess Ill check when I get home and let you know.   Either way though yeah this update pretty much changes everything.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Wed Jul 8 01:31:27 2015 UTC,pretty good since I have an IFV and a high power scope
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,DeltaJerry,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with the recon class? The new scopes are better. Finally we have a proper crosshair and not the T with a gap in it. The only complaint I have, is actually from the update 2 months ago. You can no longer stand up and shoot accurately. The sway is ridiculous. Going into any tower is a waste of time."
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,compugasm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:12:17 2015 UTC,They actually made it even worse with this update. Example you would get very little sway while prone but now its a lot more. also try running and even crouching and aiming...it pretty much looks like your drunk so good luck moving from cover to cover supporting infantry attacking an objective.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,loki993,-4,Thu Jul 9 13:47:02 2015 UTC,You can no longer stand up and shoot accurately. The sway is ridiculous. Going into any tower is a waste of time.   This is how I know you're a bad recon player.  Edit: added more of original quote for clarity--because understanding context is hardmode for you D students.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,mickdude2,2,Wed Jul 8 10:21:40 2015 UTC,... He's not wrong. Towers are the first place people look for snipers. You're bound to be killed from a tower.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,PipeGameLethal,-2,Wed Jul 8 11:46:12 2015 UTC,"You're not understanding the context. He's saying it's bad because he can't easily stand and shoot now, implying that he thought towers were a good place for that beforehand when he could stand and shoot.  Jesus. You guys are so gung-ho about downvoting me and disproving me that you don't even bother to read the whole discussion.  The funny thing is I've been right about everything so far. Recon has been trashed, the game has turned even worse into a sniper simulator, and short-range weapons are now outperforming sniper rifles out to 350 meters.  But who wants to listen to a player with nearly 2k hours of play time under their belt?"
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,PipeGameLethal,6,Wed Jul 8 12:03:46 2015 UTC,All that play time and you still sound like a jackass.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,mickdude2,-2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"How in the hell would playing a video game a lot make someone nicer?  Being good at a video game doesn't inherently make someone nice. Conversely, being a jackass doesn't inherently make someone wrong.  You shitbirds can hate me all you want and bury me in downvotes, but that doesn't negate anything I said. It just makes you all look like you're choosing ignorance purely out of spite."
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,mickdude2,3,Wed Jul 8 13:52:05 2015 UTC,Who cares what you have to say if you come off as irrational and pretentious?
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,mickdude2,2,Wed Jul 8 13:58:39 2015 UTC,Ad hominem. I agree with him.
HeroesandGenerals,3chyxg,compugasm,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"Are you even hearing yourself? The whole point is that I AM being rational, you just dislike me so much that it's affecting your ability to see I am correct.  You're essentially saying, ""I don't care if you're right, I think you're an asshole, so you're wrong."" That actually is irrational. You're only arguing here just so you can keep calling me an asshole in a different way--all because I called someone out for saying I was wrong about recon while they essentially admitted to being bad at the class.  You have no legit reason to be here other than to call me an asshole repeatedly, but I am the asshole? Lol, nigga please."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,RealityAskew,8,Tue Jul 7 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... My first emotion when I saw this was joy. I definitely like that ANYTHING can now be acquired from just playing.   EDIT: It definitely isn't pay to win, it's pay to progress."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,TheWindBlownLeaf,3,Tue Jul 7 15:12:07 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair categorization.  Still feels wrong though.  Only time will tell.
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,African-dave,2,Tue Jul 7 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think this build has finally drawn a line in the sand over this pay to win argument, guys you can unlock absolutely everything with credit (those things you get for free) so you could essentially play and get anything you wanted without spending a single dollar. Definitely in the pay to progress category. I for one am STOKED about this considering I've only spent 7 bucks since I started."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,hemansteve,2,Tue Jul 7 21:59:54 2015 UTC,Second badge for Veteran is still a pay to win feature. I would like to see that go completely from the game.

HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,TeleVue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:17:31 2015 UTC,1.7 million for 90 day vet. Totally do-able in a few weeks of grinding skirmishes depending on your salary.
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,3,Wed Jul 8 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"That's making 19k a day, seven days a week, for 90 days--after repairs, ammo, reloads, etc.  You need to revisit your math if you think that's sustainable for the average player."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,TeleVue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:37:18 2015 UTC,"Probably not do-able for the average player but for others, I think it's do-able especially for people who've reached the end game who have everything unlocked and don't use costly equipment. A simple grunt who uses a bolt action rifle capping points on skirmishes can rack decent profits after each game considering how quickly many skirmishes end."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:47 2015 UTC,Then what does that mean if vet status is not sustainable without spending real money?
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,TeleVue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing. You don't need vet to play the game or get the full experience of H&G. It's an enhancement for people who have extra credits. If you want to buy vet with real money, then go for it. 90 days with vet membership is plenty of time to rack tons of money for those who don't waste equipment and play regularly. ."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,I_SEE_ONE_DIRTY,6,Wed Jul 8 03:56:24 2015 UTC,"Bottom line, I welcome this change.   It's not pay to win at all - it's still the pay-to-not-grind. Also, have you noticed that you can't just buy individual items? If you wanted to buy your way thru this game you'd have to pay for all the ribbon unlocks just to ALLOW yourself to buy the weapons, tanks, etc. with real money. I'll still continue to pay for vet status. I feel like with this change we'll see new players not buying advanced weapons, but rather the ribbons as their wallets allow -- therefore on the battlefield I predict we'll see less lvl 1 folks with Thompsons, etc. This model does however allow Reto to squeeze more money out of the whales who will pay ""whatever it takes"" to get the newest, shiniest toys.   I'm all for it. Reto needs to make money for this game, and moreover market their strategy towards those who will pay for it. OP, I'll give you an upvote because this is an important discussion, however I disagree with your sensationalist attitude."

HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,IHeartCannabis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:27:47 2015 UTC,I agree being able to buy things results in a loss of achievement for those who earned it. Same way I feel about camo. I bought my german flektarn camo for my infantry and recon with gold. Now ppl can buy it with credits.

HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,loki993,2,Tue Jul 7 17:34:39 2015 UTC,I haven't been in the game yet but I've seen a lot of people talking about it. Fact is now that I have an idea of how this works I'm fine with it. It seems like its pretty darn expensive to get the stuff so if someones willing to spend the money so be it. Also the fact that you can do it with credits too makes it better.   Not so sure about the credit nerf though....
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,loki993,3,Tue Jul 7 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"I agree ribbon progression shouldn't be able to be altered with currency, but when it can be altered by anyone playing the game, freebie or not, it's not a pay to win mechanism."

HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,Onthenightshift,2,Tue Jul 7 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"Its not exactly pay to win because you can still get it with credits its just going to take you a lot longer.   However I do agree it seems a bit gamebreaking because now any kid can buy a OHK rifles..and put a scope on it now, or a heavy tank or that level 12 camo badge..etc etc.....it doesn't make a lot of sense."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,aMusicLover,2,Tue Jul 7 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is that Pay to Win, by its strictest definition, would mean a game that you could only progress by paying?  I guess if that's true then yes this isn't pay to win, but damned it just feels wrong to make this change."
HeroesandGenerals,3cf8lz,Onthenightshift,2,Tue Jul 7 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"Pay to win means someone can gain an unfair advantage by buying something that's not available to everyone else. Like a different gun with better stats, different mods things like that, better vehicles. The camo was sort of pay to win because it does give you a bit of an advantage.   Its usually not considered pay to win if you can just get something anyone else can get just faster...actually thats how most F2P games work. The problem is they usually take it too far and make ridiculously hard to grind if your playing for free.   So by definition no its not pay to win but still its not good and I don't agree with it..that's for sure....unless they make it so expensive that only someone with more money than brains would be willing to actually pay for it."

That having been said giving scopes to more weapons is a tragic and short sighted (punn intended) mistake.  Maybe they are thinking of changing the name to Snipers and Generals?  Listen we already know the reason why they are doing this and it's simply another money grab.  Dangle a new shiny scope in front of your average (sub-par) 10 year old player and they'll knock over the local 7-11 for the cash to buy it.  I know this game isn't historically realistic, but seriously this is just @#$@@ retarded.  I can see it now, no one will run anywhere but instead after spawning immediately drop to one knee and start scoping.   Hey maybe I'm wrong and this will be awesome but I already know it's going to suck.  Oh and one final note, good bye recon.  Why play recon when I can simply go infantry, get a OHK K98 and then add a scope.  Heck I even get 4 more slots for grenades and such.  Just another way to dilute the roles and make things more ""fair."""

I mean it just doesn't do anything positive for the game except placate the kiddies.  I'll be honest I will likely find a new game to play once this Walker nightmare comes out.  It's just going to be a sad day because I've invested a ton of time into this game.
HeroesandGenerals,3cbg6y,RealityAskew,2,Mon Jul 6 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not liking where the game is heading with all the scopes.   When they first talked about  adding scopes back around devstream 30ish it sounded at the time the quality of the optics wouldn't be so great, I remember thinking at the time it would be a fair trade.   Now that I have seen the video of the scopes it will definitely break the game over the long run.   World of snipers   Edit -  A quick thought, maybe they should remove the onscreen reticles for scoped weapons. Make a scoped weapon a trade off instead of an easy out."
HeroesandGenerals,3cbg6y,woohooguy,2,Mon Jul 6 18:05:29 2015 UTC,Even if the quality of the scope isnt good you can still hide in a bush 50 meters from an objective and pick people off easily. It will also make general aiming a bit easier because your FOV may not be obstructed as much as with irons. Now this is actually a good thing and the intended purpose I'm assuming but Im guessing they're just going to be severely exploited once they're released.

HeroesandGenerals,3cbg6y,TeleVue,2,Mon Jul 6 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. They've said before that it'll be an ""end of the road"" achievement to get a scope. I'm speculating that you'll need 2000 kills before you unlock a scope.   It also has it's disadvantages like a smaller field of view which could prove deadly in CQC. I seriously doubt you'll be seeing low level noobs having them.   And with our current system of mods not beig able to be unlocked with gold, no one can purchase them with real money. You'll have to grind which excludes new noobs.   I still think you can't put scopes on BA as an infantryman. I think just a couple SA, SMG, and LMG will get them for infantryman. Scoped BA will and should be only for Recon.   SA rifles are inaccurate over a distance of 75m.   Lastly, I'm thinking STG44 will be 3HK. All SMG and LMG are 3HK. Even the M1919 (the US belt fed machinegun) is 3HK despite being able to be modded to have a damage of 49.   It's too early to critisize. We've just seen dev streams so far."

Occasionally I'll switch to a wide screen TV to get a better field of view for SMGs etc but the monitor makes a big difference when it comes to a tight, zoomed field of view and I see this as more of a game balance issue than what weapons are offered. In addition, factories is getting an overhaul to allow more cover and ease of capping. If map changes like these are made to some of the other maps (more cover) then I think it should be possible to use combat movement and vehicles to push points.

HeroesandGenerals,3cblvc,Zackory,3,Mon Jul 6 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"Rocket launchers are too expensive to be useful unless you really want to win a match, use AT mines and panzerfausts instead.   Tanks are meant to be dominating, and as an infantryman you're not supposed to focus on the tanks- your job is to go after the objective and allow your own tanks to deal with the enemy tanks. You can assist them of course (spotting is very important for example), but you should realize that infantry are always going to be at a disadvantage versus armor."
HeroesandGenerals,3cblvc,Kahzootoh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"As a tanker, I actually agree with you. Other tanks are easy game for another tanker, but for my infantry buddies in the field they can be a nightmare because AT equipment is so expensive. I try and run a panzerfaust box on my butt every game to make sure that my infantry buddies can finish off a tank if he gets me first so they can keep advancing without having to wait for me to make my way back.   It's honestly ridiculous. I can also get into situations fighting infantry where I am pretty much invincible, killing them by the droves and it's just not fun. Sure, it's helping us clear an objective, but it's overkill.   I understand that this is how it was most of the time in World War II, but come on. That doesn't make for fun gameplay."
HeroesandGenerals,3cblvc,MightyVanguard,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:01:31 2015 UTC,If anti tank measure prices were lowered tanking would become useless or obsolete and if the prices were raised H&G would turn into world of tanks or warthunder. The prices are fine the way they are IMO (as strange as it seems ) simply because of what would happen if they were touched. And I've been on both ends (infantry with AT and a tanker ) and it seems fair also seeing how tanks themselves aren't cheap and if you don't go at least even in K/D as a tank you will go negative (and you would have to win that game otherwise you would go negative ) so ya. That's my 2 cents take it as you will but that's all I have to say about that. (Srry for the wall of text )

HeroesandGenerals,3c9lno,compugasm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"The best way to get points as recon is to hang back from the main attack and camp for defense points. You get like 50-60pts for killing someone once they enter the objective. After trial and error you will find sweet spots to hide. The skirmish maps are best for this because they're under continual threat so you don't have to constantly shift positions, and you don't need a vehicle because everything is close. Also, skirmish maps are usually 10-15 minutes long. So you will gain points quicker.   Just playing only skirmish could be boring after a while. Assault matches typically last 30-60 minutes and you get almost the same amount of points as you would a skirmish match. On the assault maps, I would play a few games where you do NOT attack anyone. Simply go through friendly territory and sit inside the objectives, noting where the best places where someone inside the objective can be killed from. The point is to reduce the time you are running around, and maximize the time you are shooting prone into the objective, because you already figured out where to shoot from."

So I guess the answer to the question is yes, you will get recon badge points for defense kills, if you're 250m away.  What you have to do is defend objectives, not run in and try to take them. As a defender, most of the time you'll get some Rambo thinking he'll take a point all by himself. That leaves just you to pick him off and get the points. You shot someone, and get points. That's all that really matters because you need to upgrade your weapon, and get the sniping badges. You do that, by shooting people with your gun. Think like a sniper."

You can earn recon xp also by doing long range shots and kills that way, but before you get scoped BA that is very difficult to do reliably, and thus not a good source of recon xp.

HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,RaulMcMahon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"To get useful tips, what faction are you playing for, and what is your current loadout?   I'd advise you play the Staged Matches, as they usually have lower leveled players on them, so it'll be slightly easier than the war (you get some real pro's on there). Depending on your loadout, play to the style of weapon. For example, an SMG (Thompson, MP-34, PPSH-41 etc.) you can storm buildings and engage is close-quartered battles, however if you're using an LMG, or BA(bolt-action) Rifle, that can be a little trickier as you've got to walk (ALT) and aim, being pretty hard when being suppressed by an SMG or even an LMG (if setup).

HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,TeleVue,7,Sun Jul 5 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Terrible gun if unmodded. A real stopper when fully modded.   I used a G43 and K98 at the same time. One for close to medium ranges, the other for medium to long ranges. Use the K98 when you can and just play casually. Overtime, you'll rank up and unlock the mods. I went down this path my first time and learned that a OHK rifle is very versatile. On the other hand, it has it's limits like being terrible in close quarters combat.   If your gamestyle is rushing objectives, the MP40 would probably be best. If you cap objectives casually while also sometimes sit around camping, the K98 might suit you.   If you want a mid point, get the MG42. That's what I'm using now and I haven't looked back. Best gun in the game."

HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,hemansteve,3,Mon Jul 6 02:12:50 2015 UTC,Save grenades for clearing the capture point where you get the extra XP.
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,TheWindBlownLeaf,2,Wed Jul 8 23:45:32 2015 UTC,I don't even use grenades since I play with the semi-auto rifles anyways. If you storm objectives then they are useful.
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,RnR4ever,2,Tue Jul 7 10:07:02 2015 UTC,"+1 with what others are saying. Don't spam them without good chance of kills or improve your ability to defend/take a point.  If you like to ""blow stuff up"", consider using anti-vehicle mines at choke points (i.e., cap point entrances at the cap point closest to your enemy base. It's common to see enemies rush their closest cap point in attempts to recover it, sometimes a jeep with 3+ people). It's always hilarious to see them flying when they drive right over the entrances."

HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,Incandescent_Souls,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the devs wanted the balancing in weapons and vehicles to be like, X vehicle excels in ability 1 but suffers in ability 2 while Y vehicle excels in Ability 2 but suffers in ability 1, instead of having them exactly equal. In this case, the Lightning is better at bombing and is more accurate but is less maneuverable and slow, while the Messerschmitt excels in what the Lightning suffers in."

HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,iwearlederhosen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:32:14 2015 UTC,Why is it on some maps one team seems to have a decent amount of tanks while the other has none?
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,Zackory,3,Sun Jul 5 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"My answer depends on if you're talking about war matches or staged matches.  War:  The reason your team may not have the resources the enemy has, is because these resources are dependent on the generals supplying it. So if your faction's general didnt supply you with tanks for this match, you dont get tanks.  Staged:  All factions have equal resources. So if your team is not able to spawn tanks like the other team, that means that you dont have tankers on your team, or people who own that particular tier of tank."
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,iwearlederhosen,2,Sun Jul 5 14:14:50 2015 UTC,Yea I'm usually on staged. I only have light tanks on Russian and tank killer on German. Would be nice to have a tank spawn value so you could at least spawn light tanks. Like light are worth .6 vs heavy at 1 so you could still spawn someThing instead of getting wrecked and have more spawns
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,Zackory,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"In staged matches, sometimes the server lets you spawn only medium, sometimes heavy and tank destroyers together.  When you're on the map interface, you can hover your mouse on your or your apponont's spawn, and see the resources, that are available for each."
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,mickdude2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:28:49 2015 UTC,Spawning light tanks in a game with heavies or destroyers would NOT be fun at all. Those things would one hit you.
HeroesandGenerals,3c6uih,RnR4ever,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge in regards to the staged games, if enemies have a Light Tank assault team available, so does your team. Matchmaking would only do this if there are players on your team that are capable of deploying Light Tanks. Now, those players can choose to play their normal infantries, in which case you can get fewer/none tankers playing, even though your team technically can field them.  It happens a lot, especially when US side are a bunch of chaffees out, and German side rage about it and say ""I aint deploying tanks no more cause I can't fight Chaffees wahwahwah"".   Despite that Pz2 can chew Chaffees up with a little bit of creativity.  (Disclaimer: I play Germany)."

HeroesandGenerals,3c6azj,Onthenightshift,2,Sun Jul 5 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. People that get owned by planes seem to think anyone can just jump into a 109 and go 50/0 in a match. They don't realise it takes a lot of skill and practice to be effective, so they go buy a pilot, get in their plane with grand dreams of revenge, only to plant face first into the ground 22 times, or get ripped to shreds by aces. This then sends them crying the forums about how OP planes are and how they got rekt and how their armour assault teams got rekt reto listens to them for some bizarre reason resulting in more unnecessary nerfs to planes.  The funny thing is, planes are only op when the crybabies are getting rekt with them, they're certainly not op when its 4-5 scrub pilots on the bottom of the scoreboard all with 0 kills and 8 deaths."

I was one of the top pilots in the oceanic region around Rommel, I don't want it to sound like I'm bragging but I was pretty much untouchable with the exception of one or two of the top Allied players working together to bring me down and even then it was a stretch for them, but it took dedication and it took practice. The first time I jumped in a plane when H+G introduced them I was terrible, I hated the controls and the feel, and I crashed more often than I could count; however, a friend of mine convinced me to stick with it and I'm glad I did. Since then planes have been getting worse and worse with each subsequent update and I hardly fly these days, it just seems pointless to me now. I find that people getting butthurt about planes are the ones getting their hellcat spawn-camping sessions so rudely interrupted by an inconvenient bomb. (Back in the days before the whingers took over, the Me109 was actually effective against tanks, rather than the large foam reload counter it is now)"

I'm just stating the facts.   You think its p2w, and I dont. We both have our perspectives. Theres nothing obsolete.   Yes, but the fact of the matter is that you're wrong that it's not P2W. You can say all day you don't believe it's a very strong advantage (I'd mostly agree with you), but there is no industry definition for pay to win that says ""it's not pay to win if it's only a slight advantage.""  At the end of the day, if you pit two people of equal skill against each other, the one who paid for an advantage is going to win. That's where the phrase ""pay to win"" comes from. It didn't come from games where you literally won because you paid money; that kind of design would never last. Pay to win games succeed because of their nuanced approach to hiding the advantage from the normal players and the whales alike. That people like you think this game isn't pay to win is evidence of how good Reto is at masking the reality.   At the end of the day, this is not a charity case. Nothing comes free. This is their job, and they got bills to pay. I'm just saying that there are worse ways of doing things.   I never understood why this was always an addendum to these discussions. Who ever says that a video game company doesn't deserve to make money? I certainly didn't. Odds are, I've probably spent 5 times what the average player spends in this game. This isn't a discussion on how it's bad that it's pay to win (personally, I think there's a far better business model they could have used), this is a discussion on whether or not it is pay to win."
HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,compugasm,2,Sun Jul 5 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"Very optimized. This game has been around for years now. I've only had an issue 2 or 3 times. And that must've been due to a bad connection. No. Paying real money gets you gear quicker no doubt. Or you could spend 300-400 hundred hours of gameplay to build up the ingame credits you need. But there is nothing in this game you can buy, that everyone couldn't get through work. So it's not P2W. No glitches I can't think of, but here are unique things about this game which are downsides: Playing with your friends is almost impossible. H&G is multiplayer, but I've NEVER made a friend ingame, co-ordinated, make plans, or teamed up with anyone I met through playing the game. If you want a team experience, bring your own team. But even then, don't expect a fun team game. You can form a 'squad' and play with 2-3 players on the same team. However, you all have to play as the same type of character. So if you want to be a sniper, your buddy can't play as a tanker. You both have to be snipers. Or this sucks: You could try joining a friends game they're already in, but you have to queue for it. Expect to wait 5-10+ minutes, and if you're lucky their game won't end. It's stuff like that which makes team play not really worth the trouble. This is really single player masqurading as a multiplayer game.   Oh, and being a tanker sucks, don't bother. I bought myself the King Tiger II. Best tank in the game. However, the issues of not being able to coordinate with anyone, means infantry runs off and leaves you undefended. Being killed over and over again by infantry with grendades or mines is maddening. But even if you could coordinate defense, there is little incentive for your buddies to do so. Because an infantry guy would get 100xp for running off and capturing. But, defending your tank might get them 5xp IF they kill someone.   Finally, queue time is an issue. Playing in a tank/airplane means you can only play where a General has placed that resource on the map. So, you will be waiting 1-10 minutes for your turn. Don't be surprised when you join a game that is almost over. Many times I've joined a game, and it ended before I could fire a shot. Not worth a 10 minute queue time.  All of this means you will be infantry, do a lot of bike riding, running, and dying over and over and over. Put up with that until you unlock Recon and become a sniper. Then, you can play a solo style game, without all the dying and running. In fact, sniping is the only reason I've continued with this game for so long. I think all the other character classes suck."
HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,TommyT223,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"The ""squad"" system is both unnecessary and useless. If you have someone(s) and add them as a friend and they add you as a friend, one of you can join the battle. Then, in the friend list, you can click on that person and it should say that they're in the battle and have a red button you can all click to join them in the battle.  Then you can play whatever class you want and still be in the same battle."

HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,compugasm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:56:51 2015 UTC,Just wait until we get the STG-44.  I'm sure that will fix everyone's problems with snipers. /s
HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"A sniper is supposed to one shot kill. There isn't armor to stop sniper bullets. What might be OP, is the gold guile suit. I can easily rack up 20 kills before someone figures out where I am. I think the thing that sucks the most for infantry, is to run all the way to the objective, and get killed just as you reach it. That would make me even madder, to run all that way for nothing. As a sniper, I camp the objectives for defense points. After I kill about 15 people running along their ant line paths, I wonder how pissed off they're getting as I murder them."
HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,compugasm,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"But there is nothing in this game you can buy, that everyone couldn't get through work.

HeroesandGenerals,3c541f,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Sun Jul 5 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"Lying? A little harsh accusation isn't it? Jesus calm down already. I told him exactly what to expect, that nobody else mentioned. I forgot about the badges.   But badges don't make a big difference. And depending on your occupation, camo won't help either. You don't need camo as a pilot, tanker, or paratrooper. Also, I always play as a sniper, and camo has never made a difference when you can 1 shot kill someone within 300 yards. Maybe it helped them on the rare occasion of a foggy map... but other than that, camo is irrelevant when you can see someone running on top of a hill against the sky. If you're close-up infantry, then camo you'll be right in front of whoever you're shooting. There, a whole paragraph on camo. Happy?"

HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,TeleVue,3,Fri Jul 3 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"i'm hoping that there are 2 ways to unlock this gun , SMG 12 grade and LMG 12 grade."
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,Comrade_agent,3,Fri Jul 3 21:10:16 2015 UTC,I think SA 12 would make more sense.
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,TommyT223,5,Fri Jul 3 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"SA 12th grade wouldn't make any sense, its a full auto shooting a shortened rifle round, i'm guessing it'll be LMG 12 or SMG 12."
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,Qwanzar_Gaming,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:51:00 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping it is 12th grade SMG or LMG.
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,Comrade_agent,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"I think it would because the STG-44 doesn't have too much in common with the German LMGs, and I think it would be strange to have SMG assault unlock a rifle."
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,TommyT223,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"the same could be said about a SA unlocking a LMG, the STG is a nice mix of the SMG and LMG it has the middle ground."
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,Comrade_agent,2,Sat Jul 4 07:41:30 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer SMG-12 , LMG-12, and SA-12 to make it even harder >:) with a cost of 400k. It'd be the end of the game rifle."
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,TangibleLight,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:36:46 2015 UTC,I think he was suggesting it require SMG 12 or LMG 12. Not both.
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,November_One,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:49:21 2015 UTC,I think you will unlock a new Assault Rifle ribbon @ LMG ribbon lvl 9. In this new AR ribbon you will need to level up to 9 or 12 to unlock the STG44. Currently you unlock the LMG ribbon @ SA ribbon level 9. This makes the STG44 a real end-game weapon.
HeroesandGenerals,3c10kq,PipeGameLethal,2,Sat Jul 4 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"STG-44 and M1/M2 Carbine will be introduced into the game.  STG-44 rate of fire on stock speed is the same as the MP-40 (around 540) M1 Carbine is not the same as the M1/M2 Carbine with the M1/M2 being the full auto version while the M1 is the Semi Auto. US Paratroopers will be able to place a scope on the M1 Carbine only (the semi-auto version) but not on the M1/M2. M1 and M1/M2 Carbine (Full-Auto version) fire a much smaller round than the STG-44 meaning the M1/M2 will deal less damage than the STG-44.  Since the M1 and M1/M2 Carbine is a smaller and lighter rifle with a higher ROF, it will have LESS MORE recoil than the STG-44 but will not be quite as powerful.  German paratroopers will not be able to equip the STG-44. You got your god damn FG-42... Firing full auto with a scope makes recoil unbearable (opinion) but firing at Single fire will make it bearable.  Although rifles will have scopes, rifles will not behave like a sniper. They are inaccurate.  Reason why the FG-42 is an LMG is because it fires a full size rifle round which is probably why rumors are that STG-44 will require LMG 12.  M1/M2 Carbine and STG-44 both have high recoil full auto with the STG-44 consistently firing vertically while the M1/M2 Carbine fires a little to the left/right while climbing vertically. STG-44 climbs a little bit less. M1/M2 Carbine costs 6 equipment points. STG-44 costs 7 equipment points. [My opinion here, I might as well keep my MG-42 if it's going to be 7 equipment points since it has a 50 round belt.]  Scopes will act as weapon mods. You can take them off anytime. You will not be required to purchase a new rifle like the Bolt Actions and Sniper Rifles. They give a demonstration about the buffed Anti Aircraft guns. The Flak gun seems to do a whole lot more damage, the American AA does a bit less, and the Russian does least. Keep in mind, Reto. Gargamel isn't the most accurate gun in the world... STG-44 and M1/M2 Carbine will be unlocked at a level 12 ribbon but they aren't saying. They're also saying that they're going to change how ribbons work in the Walker update. Rumors on forums are it will be LMG 12. Recons will have different scopes than what infantry will get. Recons will have higher quality and higher zoom scopes. Infantry can have scopes on Semi-Autos. Keep in mind, they will still not be able to compete with long range bolt action rifles which are more accuracy, precision, and damage.  The crazy weird letter bugs (most commonly seen on faggots naming their rifles with weird letters] has been fixed on the Walker build. If you don't know what that is, players have been naming their rifles with weird Asian letters that have been causing the guy being fired at to get lag spikes. I've personally witnessed this but I didn't receive any lags. Instead, my kill feed showed a completely different rifle used to kill me than what my opponent used [Enemy used an M1903 but my kill feed showed a K98]."

HeroesandGenerals,3bz43d,nebraskawow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:18:21 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia:   the rifle was nearly uncontrollable in automatic fire.   Would it be worth the effort to put it into the game? It might end up being just an SVT-40 with 5 more rounds...  Still, at least it was in service at some point during the war (probably for less than a year in the beginning, I guess), was in larger numbers than the other candidates for such a rifle for H&G, and had more than 10 rounds."

HeroesandGenerals,3bz43d,nebraskawow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:27:08 2015 UTC,"In this game devs can adjust every weapon as they like. So scoped SVT with full-auto for CQB, 2-3 bullet bursts for mid range and semi-auto for 50+ meters might be very useful for soviets actually."

HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,hemansteve,5,Thu Jul 2 19:30:56 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to agree. The PTRDs barrel is far to long and heavy to be able to be shot standing. It would be a struggle for a weight lifter to shoot accurately whilst standing with a PTRD at anything over 50 meters.
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Zackory,0,Fri Jul 3 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"I dont have a problem with that. The ptrd isnt as great as people make it out to be. It only takes out light armor.

HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,mosler,5,Thu Jul 2 17:45:15 2015 UTC,we all know it most common purpose in game is anti infantry and anti plane. i dont want to hear about medium tanks and heavy tanks.
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,M4rcato,3,Thu Jul 2 19:32:16 2015 UTC,"It can take out planes, infantry, transport vehicles, and  light armor, all with an ammo price of pennies. It's not like the russians cant take out medium and light armor with other weapons. taking out transport vehicles is especially effective in slowing down an assaulting enemy. If the soviets dont want the PTRD, I can tell you the Germans would gladly trade the shreck for it."

HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Nut922,3,Thu Jul 2 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"But did the Soviets actually use that many weapons?  I mean, I don't know of any Soviet weapons that were actually used in WWII that could be added as a Soviet assault rifle. There was one Russian rifle from WWI that has been suggested, but, again, that was from WWI.  Soviet paratroopers (for what little parachuting they actually did during the war) used the PPSh-41 and DP-28, as far as I know. There are a few weapons that could be added like the PPS, but that was more of a sidearm."
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Zackory,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:48 2015 UTC,AS-44 AVT-40
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Nut922,2,Thu Jul 2 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"Looks like the AS-44 was only put into trials after the war ended, and the AVT-40 was useless in full auto.  Edit: It seems inappropriate to add a weapon that was a prototype during the war."
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Zackory,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"They're adding stuff based on if it was used or not.  They said ""If it's been used once during the war, we can add it."""
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Nut922,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"I know, but they were talking about the Panzer VIII Maus, not a rifle that was found to be bad.  The AVT's full auto capability was prohibited for being too uncontrollable and straining on the rifle, and production of it was stopped after a year, in 1943."
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,hemansteve,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:26:54 2015 UTC,Fedorov Avtomat was produced in low numbers and was not produced through WWII but may have seen action.  RPD production began in '44 so limited use in WWII but would be amazing for a Soviet Paratrooper.
HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,Nut922,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"The Fedorov Avtomat (that is the one I mentioned earlier) was out of service by WWII, so I would rather not have that in the game.  The RPD would be a great addition, I completely forgot about that. There's enough evidence that somebody at least had their hands on it during the war, so I can accept that; however, that's a straight-up LMG, so unless paratroopers are given the ability to use all LMGs (which would be OK with me, since the Soviets used the DP-28) it wouldn't be fair to the other factions. That thing had 100 round belts.  Edit: Interesting note that it was created by the creator of the DP-28 and other weapons, like the PTRD and PPD."

HeroesandGenerals,3bv1vv,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,0,Fri Jul 3 07:12:28 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, the weapon had zero effect in the war because of its late entrance. If they're going to start introducing weapons like this, than we should start seeing things like the Super Persching.  Secondly, it's just another cash-grab item that is capitalizing on the sniper game, which will not only ruin balance, but further shut down actual snipers. I find it hilarious that Reto had to nerf the snipers in this game because ""of all the complaints"" and here they are introducing something far more toxic.  Thirdly, on paper, this gun and its corresponding scope has more range than the snipers in our game right now. How exactly is that going to work out? Are we really going to have a selective-fire gun with greater range than a sniper rifle?  But none of that matters, because the only assholes left playing this game are the CoD fratboys who eat this shit up."

HeroesandGenerals,3bpl8c,paradox242,2,Wed Jul 1 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"This has been an issue for me for months and months. Crazy input lag in general. The same issues persisted even after I got a new router for unrelated reasons.  It commonly takes 2-3 seconds to get into or out of a vehicle while I am spamming e. It can take the same amount of time to zoom in or out of the gunsight, or to switch from 3rd to 1st person when in a tank. Point blank shots into an enemy's chest don't register. Sometimes my gun will fire twice (imagine the normal gun shot, with a second one overlapping it only with a half second delay). One of the more infuriating issues is the ""ghost reload"". You're down to 7 bullets in your MG but have two more enemies bearing down on you. You pull back behind cover and wait for the 3+ second reload to complete. You step back out and within half a second you are out of ammo. Oops! That reload never actually happened even though the animation played!   These are all major issues that make the game feel clunky and keep it from being really great. They all result from a bad implementation of a good idea. Everything you do gets sent to their server to make sure you are ""allowed"" to do it. This is to counter cheating, but if the messages from your client don't make it to the server or if there is delay in processing you get the issues mentioned above."

But than after i started being matched with higher lvl i just can't do anything if i end with 200score it's a good game.  I like playing with smg , for some reason with the semi-auto weapons i either can't see anyone and die in seconds or even if i see someone they usually take a better long range shot than me.  So there are any tips that can help me learn to play with the smg(i guess they should be called light infantry...), i mean that this class should have a better role than being a meat target for every tank and every semi-auto weapons/snipers that can hit me from 100m,and i can't do anything, probably i suck playing against older players...  Or would there be any other way i can be usefull for my team at only lvl 3 , since prob as a paratroper will work better with smgs. For some reason my team always losses a assault or a deffence and i don't know how to be more important in the battle."
HeroesandGenerals,3be8s2,TeleVue,3,Sun Jun 28 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"When choosing your battles, play staged battles only and limit your map selection to maps you feel most comfortable on.   Stay infantry and keep using semi-automatic rifles. Infantry makes the most amount of money. Tankers, Recon, and Paratroopers makes the least amount of money. If ever you wantto switch to Paratrooper, don't switch your main character to another class. Instead, make a new character and make him a paratrooper. In that way, if ever you run out of Paratrooper lives in the battle, you can revert back to infantry. Also, there aren't alot of paratrooper battles as compared to infantry so you'll end up getting kicked if the game runs out of infantry spawns. Your main character will be your main money maker the higher in rank he gets.   Semi-Automatics are decent guns and are cheap to repair meaning more money in your pocket for bigger toys. I recommend you stick with them since they are good and also unlock LMGs.  If you see someone die, pick up their weapons and use it. It will not cost you any money using someone else's guns and it allows you to get a feel and sound for the guns. Let me tell you, the starter SMG are a load of BS (Unless its the PPD) since they all have short range and low power. Semi-Automatics have medium range and medium power allowing you to be able to reach enemies further. Eventually, you'll get to SMG level 5 from using dead player's SMGs and have 150k to be able to purhase them. Yes, they are expensive but you keep them for a lifetime and they will make you millions in the long run.  Go from cover to cover. The tactics that may have allowed you to get high scores in noob battles  will not work in veteran battles. Remember, this isn't Call of Duty where you can sprint and run in open places expectig to live. This is H&G where there are snipers covering areas pickig off noobs who are too dumb to flank and cover. Before you move, check the area for movement and then make the move if it's safe. You'll survive longer that way.   Don't buy Bazookas or Panzershrekts. They are a money hole and you'll end up losing money. If there are tanks, avoid them. Their field of view is very narrow so they will most likely not see you. If there are many, stay in doors. If you keep havig problems, avoid them again and let other tanks deal with them. Your job is to go against infantry, not tanks. So don't be thinking you'll be some sort of Panzer killing idiot who thinks it's his duty to kill tanks and then complain how expensive anti tank shit costs. Just don't. It's not your job. Your job is to capture objectives. That's it. Getting kills just goes along with it.   Last thing, playing againsts veterans is good. Its frustratig at first but you'll never learn if you don't get challenged. Keep asking questions and make sure you take their advice. In no time, you'll rank quickly and your salary will be 7K per match."

HeroesandGenerals,3be8s2,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:20:15 2015 UTC,PPsH > MP40 > Thompson   While the Tommy is not bad by any means (I love mine) it's outclassed by the MP40 (insanely accurate with good rof) and ppsh (71 round clip and easily controlled after getting used to it). The PPsh in the right hands will clear house objectives with 4+ guys in it as it'll be awhile before you have to reload.
HeroesandGenerals,3be8s2,unkillable94,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:22:41 2015 UTC,What's up with the matchmaking? As soon as I hit level 4 with one nation my level 1 and 2 soldiers are fighting tanks and armored vehicles with the basic rifles. It's completely unfair and progression is painfully slow to the point that I'm considering quitting the game if it doesn't get better.

HeroesandGenerals,3b7pek,daspoulos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:12:07 2015 UTC,I have to agree this seems nearly gamebreaking.

Not to mention a scoped stg44 which is going to be op even without a scope.
HeroesandGenerals,3b7pek,loki993,2,Mon Jul 6 04:41:05 2015 UTC,So then what's the point of having a recon character if anyone can slap a scope on their gun.
HeroesandGenerals,3b7pek,M4rcato,2,Fri Jul 3 05:07:12 2015 UTC,This is my point exactly.  Giving scopes to everyone negates the recon role.

Hell, I will even pay for a 90 day suscription in order to support the dev's. I never payed for gaming but in this case it is worth it. The game is about running and dying..... a lot .....and that makes it kinda fun. Instead of bitching about OP, why not try to adapt and make the best out of it. I'm still in the light tanks and I have more tank kills with Panzer II than with III. Getting into staged battles is actually pretty easy and there are always plenty of players around.

In other words...he quit a couple of weeks ago...and is asking if the game hurried and died since he didn't like the changes so EVERYONE else must have not liked it and quit playing within the last 2 weeks.  If you look at this history his last post to these forums(which I assume would be the last time he played) was 16 days ago.  So...OP is just trollin'.

HeroesandGenerals,3atzjj,Fababo,8,Tue Jun 23 14:23:15 2015 UTC,There is a shit map in every FPS game. You can't polish a turd but you can sprinkle it with glitter. Starting on the ridge on B line is better than the previous approach.  I don't like the idea of splitting ammo and health into 2 separate crates. That's just a way to charge twice for supply crates on vehicles.
HeroesandGenerals,3atzjj,hemansteve,3,Tue Jun 23 14:35:04 2015 UTC,It will be harder to attack on the ridge if you're defending. That may cause battles to last longer.  Sometimes i don't know if it's a good or bad thing
HeroesandGenerals,3atzjj,Cubano07,2,Tue Jun 23 15:42:57 2015 UTC,I had the same reaction tbh. They started saying the split crates would give them more 'freedom' when designing bases. That made sense and sounds interesting.  Then continuing saying we have to choose which one to put on our vehicles on the fly without further explaining it sounded quite shady to me. They did not support this statement with any game balance arguments or any other logic at all. I feel they would have done this if there was a solid reason.  Perhaps you can still chose both and perhaps the cost of the crate will be halved. However RETO's behavior concerning the last few patches has made me very skeptical of these announcements.

Unfortunately for you grunts (I'm a sniper), those ""cover"" spots make great places for me to put one through your noggin.  Before people would rush into the various capture points and not really stop.  Now they will try to hide behind cover which is golden for me. :)  That having been said, I think the new select fire option (single shot) will make snipers lives a bit more difficult since people will be able to put more precise lead down range toward us."
HeroesandGenerals,3atzjj,RealityAskew,2,Tue Jun 23 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"i think that that capture point at b2 will be hard for tanks to get to, but the new and improved map looks awesome!"

HeroesandGenerals,3ao8l6,MightyVanguard,4,Mon Jun 22 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"Slapping on a Anti-tank crate works wonders for ambushing other light armor. If you are parked in some bushes or behind a building you can just hop out, take a faust and give them a nasty surprise.  If you time it correctly, taking a faust and waiting for the next one before shooting, you should have no trouble against light armour, much like when going tank hunting with a car."
HeroesandGenerals,3ao8l6,raevan,3,Mon Jun 22 09:03:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I do. Some infantry players will follow you around to mop up anyone you don't catch, and if you tell them you have a Panzerfaust crate on the back, they will use it.

HeroesandGenerals,3alkbx,Comrade_agent,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:55:09 2015 UTC,To help keep some balance they should set them to a fairly high grade maybe 10 for bipods and 12 for tripods.

Being a tanker is over-rated, because you can wait so long to get into a game, and not have enough time to do anything.

Once you get into recon 8 and above, you're looking at hundreds of hours just to get to the next level, it's insane. how about instead of just one booster they buff the recon ribbon as a whole, it's still nerfed even after the update to the V build."

HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,TommyT223,3,Thu Jun 18 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"Handgun Assault ribbon level 11  Although I'm not Recon, I used to carry a OHK K98, Parabellum, and anti tank grenades. When ever I got into sketchy situations, the Parabellum never failed me.  I don't know any of the US pistols but I modded my pistol to be a high ROF gun. Last time i remember, the ROF was like 480 which puts it right under a stock MP-40. Now the Parabellum had an 8 round magazine, 3 shot kill, and 480 ROF which made it super deadly close range. So that is what I'll recommend, high ROF regardless of the damage. I think pistols no matter how hard you try, will always be 3 hit kill so you might as well go for ROF. If you're a bad shot where you need as much bullets as possible, you got other bullets ready to fire without having to wait that millisecond because of a low ROF pistol.  Here's a little gfy of my baby that costs 183k with all the mods installed"
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,TeleVue,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:22:08 2015 UTC,You wasted a couple bullets there.
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,mickdude2,2,Thu Jun 18 14:07:06 2015 UTC,It is a matter of personal preference but I have found the 1911 better in close combat as you often end up hip firing for a head shot and the larger magazine leads to more kills.   Modding the revolver to max damage has not been to my benefit with a decreased success rate and higher bills at the end of the battle as you still require a few shots to the body to drop someone.
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,hemansteve,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:55:14 2015 UTC,What is your 1911 modded like and how good is the hoodies accuracy?
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,hemansteve,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"Akicita Kinetic, Field Adjusted Sights, Hair Trigger, Pistol Heavy Bolt, Stainless Steel Barrel.  I've pretty much gone for the economical damage buff with increased rate of fire. The sights on the 1911 I struggle so this isn't built for range. With this build I have lost  range, precision and stability so this is a hip shooting spam gun that doesn't break your wallet and good for anything out to 20 meters with iron sights. Then you have your sniper which does more damage anyways. I pretty much use it for clearing buildings hip firing. A good combo if to hit them with hip fire from your bolt gun and quickly switch to this gun and pick them off in 1-2 shots depending on your sniper build."
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,hemansteve,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds nice! What's the number for RPM, and damage points?"
HeroesandGenerals,3a8xwt,woohooguy,2,Thu Jun 18 17:09:11 2015 UTC,"1911 is modded to RoF 378 and damage is around 37.5ish out to 20m where it begins to drop off.  My Revolver is modded to 248 RoF and damage is around 45ish out to 20m where it begins to drop off.  The higher rate of fire and larger magazine and lower costs has made me run the 1911 with better success. I prefer the revolvers sights and handling, the silver color helps to hit targets in dark areas but the slower rate of fire means you really need to hit your enemy and twice within the limit of the magazine whilst they are jumping all over the place freaking out. The 1911 allows you to go nuts a bit and kick up some dust and to confused people up close in door whilst spamming for that head shot or getting lucky on a body shot on an injured player.  Edit: Screenshots"
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,matyyseek,6,Wed Jun 17 13:07:53 2015 UTC,"It's definitely because of game balancing. Cheap AP mines would lead to massive AP mine spamming, which would pretty much ruin the game.  Even though they are prohibitively expensive, they can be fun to use if you have the spare cash. There are some great places that a sniper can camp while being protected by AP mines."
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,WallyDD,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:33:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. And if they nerf the price like everyone wants they might as well get rid of tanks or any vehicles and being a german tanker main that would lead me to stop playing if they even touched the current costs
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,Cynical_Ostrich,5,Tue Jun 23 00:46:30 2015 UTC,I play for my personal gains now and increasingly ignore teamwork and winning the battle. I have stopped using weapons that leave me neutral or negative financially after a battle. I no longer spam grenades to cap a point as the expense doesn't match the gains. The new system has changed the way I play.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,hemansteve,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:11 2015 UTC,People seem to forget that tank upkeep isn't cheap either.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,Riinzler,2,Fri Jun 19 11:30:30 2015 UTC,well but when you dont repair tanks youl save up more thats possible
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,blaziken8x,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that AP mine must be a lot more precise and delicate than an AT mine or a grenade (since your target is a trained soldier and not some big ass tank that cant see shit), meaning that it would cost more to produce them."
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,MightyVanguard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"I take issue with sticky 'nades being so expensive. There's no real reason for them to be.   Yes, they can wreck light tanks, but that's the driver's fault for staying still in a light tank. Don't stay in one place for more than a few shots.   True, they can work on some medium tanks, but it's very hard to get close to one with an alert driver.   They won't even scratch a heavy tank. Unless you are the luckiest man alive, trying to sticky 'nade a Tiger is like throwing spitballs at a rhino.   They are SO EXPENSIVE though. I always come out of matches losing cash, but with the recent flood of light tanks everywhere, I can't afford not to keep them handy."
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,nebraskawow,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:19:41 2015 UTC,well ive seen people get the tiger to !5% hp whit stickies  and when they have dynamite lover and it would actually destroy the tiger  imo the stickies arent that expensive for 50 stickies in a box
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:50:04 2015 UTC,Completely fair. AP mines are extremely effective. One should not spam them or hope to go positive on credits while using them.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,Zackory,3,Wed Jun 17 13:29:27 2015 UTC,Yeah they should be expensive but to basically have to repurchase these things after using them at full price is absurd.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,nebraskawow,4,Wed Jun 17 18:02:32 2015 UTC,But here's the logic:  The mine that takes out heavy armor is far cheaper than a mine that takes out people.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,Zackory,3,Wed Jun 17 13:33:02 2015 UTC,Well it's not market simulator though. AP mine spam could make this game unplayable and has to be limited. I use AP mines from time to time and even with high ranked soldier and veteran membership go negative on credits (up to -30k per battle) and I think it's fair. I try to only use them when I can't manage without them.
HeroesandGenerals,3a5qlf,TangibleLight,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"My point wasn't about spamming.  I was comparing 1 AT mine against 1 AP mine. A mine that is capable of shredding through thick armor is dirt cheap, whereas a mine that is only required to have the stopping power of a simple grenade is as if its made out of gold.

Or, beyond cost, why adding a scope to a BA rifle removes an equipment point?   Economy is just a way to limit who gets what in a community. In this case, Reto is directly manipulating the prices to determine who gets what. With ribbons they can determine at what point in the game they get it. Of course, you can override this by saving up for an item that's beyond your current spending power, or by just paying Reto real money. It's a game, after all, and they need to play with the numbers to at least try to keep it fair and to have a ""start"" and ""end"" to it - and of course to provide incentive for people to pay."

The way the game handles joining games as friends has pretty much made it impossible to join together as a singular role type (unless it's guard), and once in, I can't find my friends unless I look very long and hard. Once I've found them, it's hard to keep their locations and actually play together. Ironically, the one thing in game that's fun to do as a team is to use the recon vehicle as a weapons platform. The tanks require no combined teamwork (as in, two people in the same tank is nearly always boring for the bow gunner).  I really want them to make one small fucking change: MAKE ANY PERSON WHO IS MY FRIEND ON STEAM APPEAR IN GREEN JUST AS IF I WAS IN A SQUAD WITH THEM.

HeroesandGenerals,39xkmm,polarc,6,Mon Jun 15 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"I feel people aren't understanding the distinction between defending a point and camping.   The reason the allies lose so many battles outside of skirmish is because the player base has no freaking clue what the job description is for assault or defend.   When you are in control of 3/4 quarters of the map from second one and lose is most frustrating because you often have idiots more interested in closing a line that doesn't matter instead of focusing on the true objective.   The principal of the game is to control points and sometimes that means hanging back to defend vital points, in no way should that be construed as camping. That's actually servicing the objective."
HeroesandGenerals,39xkmm,woohooguy,6,Mon Jun 15 21:54:32 2015 UTC,often have idiots more interested in closing a line that doesn't matter instead of focusing on the true objective.   Sometimes closing lines means killing their resources. Tanks for example.
HeroesandGenerals,39xkmm,Zackory,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"In also frustrated to no end defending on three-way battles. Usually, one attacker will have to get in the way of the other in order to capture all objectives. It's best for the defenders to fall back to the furthest objective and let the attackers drain each others' respawns and then push back as they run out of resources.   For example - the Town map. Say the Soviets are on the D line, Americans are on C. For the Germans, it would be best to capture as much as possible at the start (all dat XP), then fall back to O2. If the Americans want to win, they need to cap O1 before O2. Similarly with the Soviets. So if you fall back to O2, the attackers block each other, while the Germans can much more easily defend.   What usually ends up happening in that situation is everyone sees O1 being captured, then runs in and gets shot at by PTRDs and Thompsons.   /rant"

A camper who can take out infantry as they are transitioning between points is very useful, especially on big open maps like the airfield. I would guess it takes about a minute for an infantry to spawn at O1, find a car or bike and get to O2. If you wait until they are just about at O2 then plug them with a headshot, that's a whole minute they're out of the game.  The other great thing is that if you aggro the enemy enough they'll send 3 or 4 guys after you. That's 3 or 4 guys that aren't capping points.  The only complaint I have with campers is when there are more campers than players capping."

Spawn campers suck there, because spawns have nothing to do with victory conditions. You only get 8xp for killing someone, but you get over 100xp for taking a point. So, why waste your time? The only logical reason I can think of, is they're looking for a quick way to unlock a combat badge. But I suspect 99% of them enjoy spawn killing for killing sake.  However, on the battle maps, you have to camp the spawns, because spawns and victory are the same thing."

HeroesandGenerals,39y9dt,Darkfizzix,5,Tue Jun 16 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"Well, its usually exagerrated on a tank per tank basis. Still didn't help them because the metal tides of T-34s and Shermans swamped them. The tanks were also resource hogs and became slightly mobile pillboxes more often than not."
HeroesandGenerals,39y9dt,z1967,2,Tue Jun 16 04:31:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, quantity beats quality is the case here. But in theory they were better designed tanks then their American and Soviet counterparts. Well I guess it could be argued that the sloping of the M4 was a better design then the frontal armor on the Tiger but that was fixed in the Tiger II design"
HeroesandGenerals,39y9dt,Darkfizzix,2,Tue Jun 16 04:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, problem was the Royal was rushed and had all sorts of engine problems. It was also painfully slow and painfully hard to keep running. Pretty fearsome when they do get to battle though. Realistically, Germany might have gone farther if they improved upon the Pz 4 design or just rolled out a replacement that could actually fight the Shermans and T-34s. Well, Germany actually could have done a lot of things better but that's the power of hindsight."

HeroesandGenerals,39y9dt,mypenisthepipe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:43:44 2015 UTC,Only in the late war. Early war the German tanks were about as good as others and in some cases actually worse. The difference was that the Germans used their tanks much more effectively than other nations. If you're referring to the big kitties then yes they were very good but they were produced in so small of a quantity that they were overwhelmed by the M4s and T-34s
HeroesandGenerals,39y9dt,Knightfall2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought of german army as having the most elite troops.  The equipment on all sides was more or less equal, with exception of t-34 being an amazing tank."

HeroesandGenerals,39y95m,Riinzler,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"The BAR and FG42 both had it, and it would be extremely useful for both (unless the FG42 is given its really controllable recoil, then semi-auto might not be as necessary for it).  Additionally, both of those weapons deserve their own weapon type instead of ""Machinegun,"" and to not have the restrictively poor handling of that weapon type (Edit: which is a good restriction for that weapon type).  Of course, bipods are another absolute necessity."
HeroesandGenerals,39y95m,Nut922,0,Tue Jun 16 20:07:05 2015 UTC,"Would you write an entirely new section of code for two weapons, when you could be coding new weapons to add in game, or any other number of features?"

HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,Flojis,2,Mon Jun 15 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"They have a tricky system to not make this happen. You see, you need to play at least 50% of the match to get the salary.

HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,Zackory,2,Tue Jun 16 09:39:25 2015 UTC,"So, my understanding is that you only get a salary if you're in the battle for more than half of its duration, and Time is calculated per toon - so you can only get salary for one toon per battle as it's impossible to have two toons with more than 50% of the total battle time.  Example:   Battle Lasts for 30 minutes Toon 1 has 16 minutes in game Toon 2 has 12 minutes in game (i'm assuming some time lost between deployments)   In this case, Toon 1 gets a salary.  If both toons have 14 minutes deployed in this scenario, neither would get a salary.  For this reason you should settle on a single toon for the majority of any deployment and perhaps only drop in the alternate as needed.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm just pulling this out of my head without actually checking."
HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,WallyDD,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:36:33 2015 UTC,How mutch money do you guys earn on a basic match? Just inf? When i started I accidently bought a second soldier and i'm always getting 3k a match...
HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,Zackory,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"I can confirm what /u/davosBTC said.  And how much money you make is dependent on multiple things:   How well you've done in the match (your score) What rank your soldier is at (the higher the rank the higher the salary)   My mid level soldiers make roughly 7k on average. Not pure profit, coz there are also expenses like weapon mods, vehicles, consumables...  If you ask me, if you're getting higher than your paying, you're doing alright."
HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,November_One,2,Mon Jun 15 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"If you are in need of money, I reckon para is the way to go. Equip him with an unmodded SMG. You don't need to pay for upgrades, ammo, vehicles etc. so it's pretty much pure profit every game. You can drop straight on points so you are constantly getting cap and def bonuses which will boost your score."
HeroesandGenerals,39xg7d,loki993,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:52:47 2015 UTC,Not every game. You won't find para ATs in every match. But u will most probably find infantry ATs.
HeroesandGenerals,39w6ds,Zackory,7,Mon Jun 15 08:04:02 2015 UTC,Would love to see the trench shotgun.
HeroesandGenerals,39w6ds,and_the_sundance_kid,3,Mon Jun 15 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"Well, since the Germans hated it so much in the actual war, you can only imagine how butthurt they will be once American soldiers become unstoppable close quarters killing machines."
HeroesandGenerals,39w6ds,MightyVanguard,2,Sun Jun 21 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"And this is not the same thing as introducing the STG-44? I think the shotgun would make a good trade off. And since germans has the best smg and very op LMG's in my opinion, a good close range weapon for the US is not that farfetched."
HeroesandGenerals,39w6ds,and_the_sundance_kid,2,Wed Jun 24 00:57:56 2015 UTC,That would be nice. Paratroopers with shotguns would be really deadly landing on rooftops then jumping down to deliver death.
HeroesandGenerals,39w6ds,MightyVanguard,5,Wed Jun 24 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"STG-44 HERE I COME  New sights are cool. Maybe they'll fix the American weapons having those horribly retarded range bars so they're down. It'd also be cool if your eyes, when looking down a scope, were actually like 3 inches away with only whatever is through the scope magnified. Sorta like Call of Duty.   Extended mags sound silly. Maybe coupled mags or less magazine size for Russian SMGs."

Weather - once you learn how to look around with shift, it is really not that hard.  If you still find it difficult, just quit before it starts... You should be checking your six all the time anyway. Shift Esc APCR and HE do a pretty good job of killing stuff on the ground if you don't have a bomb ready, you just need to get better at controlling the aircraft to do it That's because your team doesn't mark them.  Also, marks don't really help pilots all that much.  Go into first person and you can see the exhaust off vehicles through the propeller   EDIT:  first person to see vehicle exhaust only works for Germany and Russia, the Americans get shafted again.

Too many new players only have pilots. The weather isn't always great and sometimes its just pointless to be in the air so its necessary you have a backup. Your not always going to be able to fly.  For the new players out there (i didn't learn this until about a month after playing) you CAN switch between infantry , para , recon , pilot etc. by enlisting more soldiers in the game lobby.

I take advantage of this exploit too since it's available but I would much prefer if main weapons were dropped. Last dev stream, one of the guys playing killed a sniper and got his shovel. The guy was completely confused on why that happened which leads me to believe the devs don't know much about this exploit. I'll keep dropping my knife to piss people off so word gets to the devs faster. They seriously need to fix this."
HeroesandGenerals,39syxk,TeleVue,3,Sun Jun 14 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"We changed it so the player will drop the item that cost the most equipment points, and in case of a tie projectile weapons will be preferred."

HeroesandGenerals,39syxk,GalacticAndrew,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a feature. At the cost of 1-2 weight (shovel/knife, wrench/pistol) and a weapon slot, you don't drop a dangerous weapon to the enemy.  You can avoid dropping any weapon at all if you get into a vehicle before you die. This can be handy if you're prone next to a bicycle with your fancy OHK scoped gun and someone runs up behind you.  But... I had to quit using one of my loadouts because it insisted my AT mines were my primary weapon, even with a pistol an AP mines equipped before it. Enemies getting several free AT mines at each death makes for a bad time."

Recon takes a very long time to unlock, which is indicative of the training they need to use the weapon. Sure, you can use the weapon, but you shouldn't suddenly be able to use the weapon with the same skill and finesse as someone trained with it."

HeroesandGenerals,39sgue,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,3,Sun Jun 14 11:00:13 2015 UTC,"Lovely pun, but yeah shooting tanks or standing on them is pointless"
HeroesandGenerals,39sgue,matyyseek,5,Sun Jun 14 10:45:42 2015 UTC,"Not in staged matches. The majority of tankers love to pop their head out to see were the nade/bullet is coming from - if there's nobody else in the vincinity, it's generally worth a try."

Instead, said tank proceeded to annihilate our team for the rest of the match because no one could get close and didn't have anti-tank gear."

HeroesandGenerals,39sqqx,BatMunki,3,Sun Jun 14 16:56:24 2015 UTC,As in the score /xp you get or as in who wins the battle scoring?
HeroesandGenerals,39sqqx,JordonBrooker,2,Sun Jun 14 18:59:56 2015 UTC,Who wins the battle scoring! :)
HeroesandGenerals,39sqqx,BatMunki,6,Sun Jun 14 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"I t depends on what mode the game is, if it is a skirmish then it is done on who has held the most points on the map for the longest time, and once the time needed is reached then it says ""the USA or whatever country it is, has successfully held the objective 93% or what ever"" the blue goes up along the bar at the top and which ever country gets the bar to the end wins, the other way to win a skirmish is to make the other team use up all their spawns, but because that so rarely happens it is normally the other one that happens.  In nomal battles there Are 3 ways to win, all the spawns of a team are used up, the team loses all their access point or the objective way, except the objective way works differently for normal modes. When you first join the battle, it either says attack, or defend, so if you are defending, you start with the O points so that is O1 O2 and O3 if your team defends these points for a certain length of time this will appear on screen ""TEAM has successfully defended the objective 98%"" then your team has won the battle, if you are attacking then you need to try and capture and hold these points on the map, and if your team has done that, then this appears ""TEAM has successfully captured the objective 99% and your team has then won, of course if the other team recaptures these points then your bar will go  down, but the more points you have the higher up your bar goes.   Hopefully this explains it all! If you have any questions just ask!"

HeroesandGenerals,39sqqx,Zackory,4,Sun Jun 14 21:02:52 2015 UTC,"Normally the defenders have half an hour to defend.

I probably see about two accusations of hacking a game though. The accusations are more rampant than the actual hacking.   As for the way they crack down on it, they're extremely smart. They won't ban a hacker straight up- they'll wait until they have a lot of similar reports (indicative of a new cheat) and they'll figure out what makes that hack work, and any markers they can use to identify it. Then they just write a program  to look for that marker, effectively making that cheat useless. They can keep up with new cheats coming out pretty well, with about two weeks time between a new cheat being out and the ban implemented."

It was the fastest armored vehicle until the turbine powered M1 Abrams tank appeared decades later.  The speed was attained by keeping armor to a minimum, no more than one inch thick, and by powering the relatively small vehicle with a radial engine originally designed for aircraft usage. The Hellcat, along with the M10 Wolverine and M36 tank destroyer, provided American and Allied forces with a respectable mobile anti-tank capability against the newer German armored types. Despite being armed with an only partially effective 76 mm cannon,  it performed well.

HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,z1967,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:04:37 2015 UTC,I use the Hafthohlladung H3.5. Because it doesn't limit you to being just anti-tank and unless the tanker has supporting infantry or actually stays alert(which isn't often cause they're in a tank and think infantry can't touch them) you can generally flank around and put them on a tank fairly easily and then go back to killing people
HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,Riinzler,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:13:42 2015 UTC,"I end up using H3s most of the time. 2 hit kills pretty much every tank in existence and is the perfect balance between cost efficiency and stopping power. Much better than stickies imo, especially for the suicidal playstyle soldiers.   Stickies are pretty hard to deal with once they get next to you though. They can toss the amount they need to kill out before you can get out and gun them down. Kinda silly, but not unbalanced.   Haven't run into those RPG-43s yet. Looks like they cost an arm and a leg to use though, guess there is the reason I don't see them."

Americans don't seem to ever bother with AT at all. At least not when I play. I carry sticky grenades and they don't seem to cost that much.
HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,MtnMaiden,2,Sun Jun 14 12:51:38 2015 UTC,"those panzershreck users are new to the game, after a couple rounds they'll abandon the weapon bc its ridiculously expensive."
HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,mickdude2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:05:47 2015 UTC,haha Maybe!  Either that or they're really dedicated to Shreckin' tanks. I wish infantry would help with them more often!
HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,Stamize,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:29:09 2015 UTC,"Infantry should not be fighting tanks. Tanks should be fighting tanks. AT weapons are there to handle one, maybe two tanks. If you're taking down an entire tank battalion, expect some cost. Otherwise, yell at your tankers to get on it.   If the tank is not completely preventing you from capping, guess where you should be?"
HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,Cozichacozee,2,Sun Jun 14 14:04:13 2015 UTC,There are a lot of matches where your tanks assault team gets absolutely fucked and you end up with only 1 team being able to use tanks. Do you want us to just give up at that point?

HeroesandGenerals,39qrqe,Schemes011,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:30:36 2015 UTC,Keep a healthy distance from the infantry and you´re fine. I think its just Bullshit that you go out of a game with a loss of money even though you´re top frag with a 2.0 KD.   So either I can get hammered all game long by enemy tanks or destroy said Tanks but lose money for actually doing something good.
HeroesandGenerals,39qoxl,SneaksDotA,5,Sat Jun 13 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the FPS and the hardware, it's the fact that the game lacks optimization in terms of consistency. I can play the game for around 1-2 hours but anything after that I get MEGA FPS lag and it will even freeze everytime there is a major explosion. I have followed all of the optimization guides I can find online, including those by beloved Kotton with no avail. Honestly, it feels as though it may be a syncing or refresh rate issue which I have tried editing myself but no success. I think you'll see the game become polished and finished as soon as this optimization issue is resolved."

HeroesandGenerals,39p5z0,matyyseek,3,Sat Jun 13 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"Try aiming near the tracks. Or at low render, where the smoke comes from. In most cases that will penetrate."
HeroesandGenerals,39p5z0,dat_eric,2,Sat Jun 13 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"I don't play Soviet, but I imagine aim for the back/side. You will most likely do more damage?"
HeroesandGenerals,39p5z0,mickdude2,6,Sat Jun 13 13:38:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, no. Armor isn't modeled in pieces- if you penetrate, you will do the same amount of damage in the front as you will the back. That being said, you are more likely to penetrate in the back."
HeroesandGenerals,39p5z0,KentFloof,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"The PTRD is better at destroying infantry vehicles (truck, motorcycle, jeep) and lightly armoured vehicles (APC, IFV).  Shooting tanks is risky without proper positioning, unless the tank is already under fire by a friendly tank. Doing this will break the damage threshold and give your friendly tank a big advantage without yourself having to be in a good position.  You can harass heavy armour by getting on top of the turret and shooting straight down. This probably works from a roof, but I haven't been able to test. At best this forces a heavy tank to relocate to avoid you slowly chipping away their health."
HeroesandGenerals,39p5z0,mypenisthepipe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:17:30 2015 UTC,I really want the ability to shoot out the viewing ports and force the tank to fight blindly or command from outside the tank. That was one of the typical russian AT methods.

But honestly, would the cost be worth it? The game has lag problems as it is. Imagine if it had to process all that it is now, plus buildings falling down. Beyond that, even if the engine could handle it, I might be against destructible terrain. How much fun would it be for tanks to just sit on a hill and just blast away all the cover from afar? Or if planes just leveled a cap point? Turning the entire thing into a flat map isn't my idea of fun."

But many of these implementations would be difficult or time consuming. There are only 3 factions right now, can you imagine adding a 4th? All of a sudden Reto has to implement an additional 1/3 of their content and somehow smoothly work this new faction into the game. There are also historical things that wouldn't quite fit in the game, like flamethrowers. Many of the maps are big, too big for a flamethrower to be worth the weight just to be brained at 200 yards by a sniper or by a smg at the end of an alley. I have no doubt that they are looking into new features, and I really do hope they put new things in, but right now I would prefer they put their man power into fixing the current problems rather then implementing new ones"
HeroesandGenerals,39ib32,MrQuicksilver,3,Thu Jun 11 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I agree they have issues now. It would be horrific to add another faction. I wouldn't be totally against them having it behind a pay wall for what its worth if they had to.   As for the necessity of a flamethrower. They'd go best if they added combat engineers. Or sappers. That's a whole 'nother can of worms for their programmers that I'd hate to open. As an amatuer programmer myself I envy the skill that is behind the game they have already. I trust they will add meaningful additional weapons for area suppression other than flamethrowers if it comes to that.   For god sakes they haven't even added the bipod as a weapon function yet. I don't expect Rome built in a day. I expect it built to 80% by the time we finish Beta build."
HeroesandGenerals,39ib32,Onthenightshift,3,Thu Jun 11 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"If they did add another faction, it would make sense to have it in another theater.

HeroesandGenerals,39ib32,Onthenightshift,3,Thu Jun 11 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"Right? I didn't even think of how it looks like they are planning additional theaters. In that case they might add Japan. But they would have to reskin a bunch of american stuff for USMC and the Japanese would be a literal fuck ton of work. I would be surprised if that came with release. Maybe after.  GB though, is a must. I can't respect a WW2 game with strategy that doesn't include those silly tommies and their weird artillery/armor.  Edit for phone mistakes"
HeroesandGenerals,39ib32,Zackory,3,Thu Jun 11 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"silly tommies and their weird armor.   I'm laughing so hard because all I can picture is HM's armed forces storming the Normandy beaches in full plate and chainmail. Then I was like, oh right, tanks.  It shouldn't be too hard to re-skin the models for Brits/ANZAC's or Japanese. The Americans you could probably keep the same, although i cant really tell the difference. It would take a bit of work because you would need new desert/jungle/beach maps but totally worth it. Would also take a lot of pressure and ill-feeling off the current war situation too as people spread out over theaters."
HeroesandGenerals,39ib32,Zackory,2,Thu Jun 11 23:19:22 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. Just wait for April fools when they actually change everyone's British characters to knights. And change their cars to horses.

If you have the time and a couple bucks burning a hole in your pocket then definitely buy veteran, the benefits are great and with regular play you will quickly unlock plenty of toys and have the coin to buy them as they unlock.   Veteran also allows you to use AT gear and still have some earnings at the end of a round  but be warned, the Zooka and personnel mines are STUPID expensive to use.   Having the second badge slot open is a nice perk as well.   It will work out to almost 20 bucks for three months time and there is no subscription based mmo worth playing that will give you that much time for the money.   You will have some gold leftover after buying 90 day vet for a couple ribbon boosters as well. Keep in mind that once a booster is purchased it needs to be activated, once activated it will run continuously for 4 hours, no pause, so make sure you have the time set aside to play.   What's also nice about veteran is it stacks with ribbon boosters, first your total boosted xp is calculated and then your vet bonus is calculated and added."
HeroesandGenerals,39hfuf,woohooguy,3,Thu Jun 11 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"This pretty much.  I had a friend ask Reto, they said they would not be doing steam sales in the foreseeable future. Just buy the 90 days."
HeroesandGenerals,39hfuf,mickdude2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"They stopped it because steam was either taking too much of a cut or they realised they could make more money selling through the buy gold system. Really too bad for us, as current options are not worth it by a long shot. I had hopes for a return to steam this sale and I have always regretted not buying the steam packs because they demonstrated actual VALUE for your dollar."
HeroesandGenerals,39hfuf,African-dave,2,Mon Jun 15 03:04:45 2015 UTC,"If you know that you are going to be playing a lot, definitely go for the 90 day plan. You can earn everything in this game if you grind hard enough, and it sounds like you have enough time in your hands. If you do end up dropping 30+ on the game, you will have some gold left over for luxury purchases, like a higher rank gun on a newly made character, or on a factory trained character when you don't want to level up a new one."
HeroesandGenerals,39hfuf,MrQuicksilver,2,Thu Jun 11 19:25:03 2015 UTC,Had that thought but it was $20 for 3 months. Can't really beat that in any game

HeroesandGenerals,39hfuf,November_One,2,Fri Jun 12 02:47:55 2015 UTC,That depends on how much you make per hour. How much you play in 3 months.

But if you buy a recon you will still have you infantry and can grind out some money on him :)"

I used the shit out of my pistol when folks came hunting me off in the woods.  Get the parabellum one.  Mine is now close to a 2HK and it's saved my bacon many a time."

HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,hansonlife,5,Thu Jun 11 00:41:13 2015 UTC,So they did remove the instant kill.  Well that's stupid.
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,3,Wed Jun 10 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it ever was insta kill, but sometimes I was getting 1 shot kills to peoples back, and if they are crouching, its almost always a headshot when stabbing at mid range."
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,3,Wed Jun 10 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely was one-shot before this patch.  I have a few hundred knife kills under my belt, and the only time it was ever more than one hit was if it didn't register at all, or I hit a limb."
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,Leto2k,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:44:35 2015 UTC,All hits to the head are still kills
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but so do all bullets. Knifing should remain OHK for body shots.  If you manage to get that close to an enemy while using a knife, you deserve some semblance of an advantage at that point."
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,Leto2k,2,Fri Jun 12 01:42:11 2015 UTC,If you are not spotted it should be fairly easy to get a head shot. If the target is actively trying to avoid getting hit it's harder to get a ohk but still not very hard to hit the body. We did decrease the knife attack time to .5 seconds with the new system so you can still kill people quickly using 2 hits (and a knife). That was the reasoning for this update.
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:50:21 2015 UTC,"Two hits in half a second is very different from one hit in no seconds. The whole point of the weapon should be about stealth, and that one advantage of stealthiness is lost when your enemy is bouncing around and randomly shooting their gun while looking for the person whom they will almost positively kill. A pistol does a better and more reliable job from 30 times the distance.  With this change there's no reason to have a knife exept simply because you have an equipment slot you're not using. That's not strategy; that's desperation or convenience.  At that point it shouldn't even take up an equipment slot, which makes me wonder if there should be two options: a two hit kill knife that takes up no equipment space, and a one hit kill knife that takes up a single equipment slot."
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,GaryBuseyOwnsYou,3,Fri Jun 12 11:30:41 2015 UTC,"Does this work as well with the shovel? I'm assuming the shovel works better too now with the new system but i mean, is the shovel as lethal as the knife? 2 hits? 3 hits?"
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,Gamedude05,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:33:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly I have no clue. I didn't bother with the shovel, but I think they are the same damage. Knife might swing a bit faster or something."
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,Gamedude05,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:44:23 2015 UTC,I believe in the dev stream. They said the shovel is base 60 damage with a longer slower swing. The knife is 70 base with a shorter faster stab. The wrench is the worst of all three.
HeroesandGenerals,39cpu8,TommyT223,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:42 2015 UTC,poor wrench :(
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,MrQuicksilver,2,Thu Jun 11 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"Well if it's recon, shouldn't you be running the OHK? Especially if this is your only recon, you will want to have at least one character (recon) with the scoped OHK. Maybe then creating a new character (recon) as a backup to run this build, that makes sense."
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,hansonlife,2,Thu Jun 11 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"Bro...The only reason to play recon is for that OHK rifle. If you play war then you're wasting resources. Other than having fun on staged, this build isn't that good for war.   The perks are fine, I usually run Nimble and Camouflage.  I run with my German a knife in the 1st slot and the rifle in the 2nd with extra ammo.   Anyways...you do you. Have fun with what ever in the end I don't really care as long as you're happy with the performance of the build."
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,Hakumaiu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"For my german recon, I do OHK kar98k scoped (or you can save credits and not mod it and go for headshots), I have a shovel as my first slot to save credits and prevent people from stealing my rifle, and ghillie silver (i'm only at recon lvl 8), and I dont have veteran so that's all I have.  I want to get the camo badge, but with the super nerf that won't happen until the far future"
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,M4rcato,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"do that on soviet/us side, the pistol fits better with this build."
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,Reni3r,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:01:55 2015 UTC,Why play recon when you could do the same build with infantry but more inventory slots? You could run the exact same build and add a Kar98. edit: I'm confused. the items you listed will take up 8 slots? Or do you want advice on what to pick?
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,Bumpidump,0,Thu Jun 11 12:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you mean, but I feel like the recon aspect of it really adds to the effect of the build."
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Thu Jun 11 20:18:21 2015 UTC,While also completely wasting a perfectly good slot for an actual recon player!  Win/win.
HeroesandGenerals,39drwb,Babadiboopy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:38:56 2015 UTC,Honestly the only reason to rake recons if for a OHK scoped rifle. Any other build can be used much more effectively on an infantry.   Perhaps I am missing something so could you explain why you want a recon soldier so badly?

HeroesandGenerals,39b0fl,GaryBuseyOwnsYou,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:52:52 2015 UTC,"They didn't revert back to pre-v numbers. However, some of them(only the ones I see from my play) have got a boost. I know that unseen captures used to be 250, then after v they were 78, now they seem to be at 137. So it's not reverted but adjusted back in the right direction.   It also looks like melee points went down. I was pretty sure I was getting 800exp per melee kill after the new system but last night it seems to be down around 250."

The same can be said for Staged Battles versus War Battles, some people believe and I'm not kidding when I say this that you either a) receive more reward from Staged, or b) more from War, when in reality it doesn't differentiate between either, the change is on the duration and what you do in the battle itself.

HeroesandGenerals,39ccwo,Cubano07,2,Thu Jun 11 02:39:27 2015 UTC,The reason why is the fact that you need to get side by side to a tank in order to use it. The other two grenades are thrown from a distance

As for new fronts, expect Africa to be added next. Before they added Russian towns, they expanded the RTS map that way. The same thing is happening now with North Africa."
HeroesandGenerals,399iiq,mickdude2,3,Wed Jun 10 08:18:52 2015 UTC,"The bayonets may be a possibility now that they overhauled the melee mechanic.   I remember after Timoshenko was released, in one of the devstreams, RedBjarne was talking about the possibility of having german forces moving back from the south after having to surrender Germany.   It would move the factions into more of the ideal triangle."

Their ""striking"" or ""stabbing"" motion/action is very simulour to Heroes and generals melee weapons action motion. Another idea would be ""rifle-butstock-hit-action"", could be used as a perk or something. Other people has already pointed out the problems with rifle shot sounds, and I wish they could be more like in Resistance and Liberation, their sounds are quite good and stands out a little from other WWII games."

HeroesandGenerals,39875x,dat_eric,3,Thu Jun 11 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"The ability to change your race or sex (yeah there were some female resistance fighters) [and there were also africans in every army not to mention the messicans in the American army]  More major factions: where the heck it Great Britain? I'd kill for a bren gun and carrier. Or Churchill heavy tanks. You could fold some factions together like french resistance with Americans. Polish resistance with soviets. Canadians with GB. foreign legion or conscript battalions for soviets or wehrmacht.  Artie as I've mentioned before could be implemented in so many ways. Mobile like a SU-85 or other assault guns like priests (GB). It could also be on far corners of the map and be available for capture by enemy units or to be taken out.  Destructable terrain and explosives? C4 wasn't big name then but demo charges, satchel charges and the like were common. This might be the hardest to add and it would make a young man's heart flutter to see it implemented as a mechanic to deal with tank warfare and urban settings.  Better projectile mechanics and/or hardcore mode. I know it isn't hyper-realism we are going for here, but one bullet to the torso would put you out for a little bit unless you had adreneline pumping through you like you've OD'd on cocaine. Add medics to tend wounded and have etiquette regarding them (aka experience penalty for shooting field medics)  Beach-head assaults? other games have done them. (Day of Defeat and the original COD and Medal of Honor games) they are a staple for any WWII game and I know they wouldn't fit into the war scenario well, but the war setup is already weird. Why not start it from the beginning of the actual war post operation Barbarossa. This would be a great time to add the new factions like GB/Canada to storm their respective beaches.  Am I missing anything? Probably."

(MP40, M3)   Add STG-44 for German infantry, but only if M2 Carbine (which did see some service in Europe in 1945) is added to American line to counter it. Move M1 Carbine for infantry to a lower (but still high) level of SA Rifle Assault. Make it easier to unlock pistols with the Tactical badge, or even add it to BA Rifle and LMG Assault in addition to Tactical to make it easier for slow firing BA and clunky, heavy LMG users to get a small weapon for easier close quarters. Add Soviet suppressed M1895 Nagant revolver (with individual cartridge loading) to the game to make a stealth weapon, and a second handgun to the Soviets. Improve sounds for all weapons. Fix BA rifle animations. When a shot is fire ingame the empty case can be seen ejecting as if the weapon was not bolt-action. The case should eject as the bolt is worked. Add adjustable sights to all SA rifles, and increase their damage over range. Fix the Garand's impossible sight picture which defies how the eye works. Fix how projectiles behave when being fired. Yesterday, I was standing face to face with a Soviet soldier who shot me in the arm, killing me, with a PTRD, even though the muzzle of his PTRD was seriously a few feet behind my back. Make all anti tank weapons, like the ST nade, H3, mines, and bazooka/pzshreck much cheaper to use and maintain repair costs. Add an option to not allow other soldiers onto your vehicle, to avoid new players coming along with you to a special spot and killing your cover by firing the MG or giving away cover by spray and praying enemies.   I have more, but not right now."

Even prone (when it actually works), the gun wobbles entirely too much to be dependable. It's pretty much the only mechanic in the game that's entirely up to chance, and the mechanic itself only exists to subsidize poor play in people who refuse to utilize cover.  It was only ever created to increase the appeal of the game for shitty players who refused to adapt, and is a perfect example of what happens when you allow your marketing to interfere with actual game design. If even a one person in their company had a single class in (or read a book academic journal Wikipedia page on) risk management or game design, they would have simply solved this (and other related problems) by injecting a better series of tutorials in the game.  Instead, they're choosing to put out every fire with their face."

I think alot of us feel the same about Reto-Moto, and not only about their poor under the ice support. Their model is the worst I've seen, they add more said broken items to the game than actually fixing already acknowledged problems. And they have been in beta for too long and use that to hide behind to have a reason to keep the broken features as long as possible. They may be a small studio, but that is no reason for the huge amounts of imbalance, bugs and general optimization issues currently going on. Instead of pushing big features like the Soviet faction they should have spent the months on actually improving the engine itself."

HeroesandGenerals,38zwtb,hansonlife,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"Currently I would say we have about 6 ACTIVE editors, 2 are translating a lot of pages to Spanish and Russian links.  The remaining work mostly on the English version which is the most up to date (still dated in many ways).   Translating work is definitely the hardest to find editors for, as not everyone is bilingual including English (+ some losses in translation) and the sheer volume of translating needed. Apart from that one of the biggest challenges can be keeping up with small changes made to weapon/vehicle stats/mods, xp earnings, and finer details. For example I had recently created a large text file of xp rewards for ribbon drivers that I was going to upload, v-build set in and now the information is out of date and the new values are unknown.  But that is the nature of a beta game - to change. Making it hard to create solid guides on certain topics."

HeroesandGenerals,38zwtb,hansonlife,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:50:59 2015 UTC,"Well as far as transparency goes I guess I am lucky that as a bug-hunter I could test these new values in a time effective way, however they are likely to be tweaked in the future so not much point ATM.   These small changes would be fine if the work was spread across more people, if we had the editor activity that we saw during the wiki competition days in September we would have likely seen much of new additions to V-build completed already. Currently I would estimate that the ENGLISH wiki is somewhere between T and U build with just a smattering of V."

HeroesandGenerals,38y5nd,ironcreed2,4,Sun Jun 7 21:05:06 2015 UTC,Flame Throwers would be kinda useless since most maps are open terrain. There isn't much deep urban combat or trench warfare.   Russian weapons should have a lower mag size. :3  Most of these suggestions just wouldn't work. There's alot of minor changes that look like they take too much time to complete and detract from bigger additions/fixes.  Multiple small factions would just break apart large factions. That's not to mention people have to regrind to general and get new ATs. It just wouldn't work.

HeroesandGenerals,38wf7i,quaedam,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"Hello I am new to the game and was wondering there are several weapons, like the bolt actions which you learn how to use in the tutorial, where you have to have number of levels with bolt action rifles already to purchase them with the silver in game currency. So my question is do you have to spend gold currency, purchased with real money in order to unlock the first new weapon in that weapon class, or am i simply to new to have been introduced to them yet and those aspect will come later."
HeroesandGenerals,38wf7i,TeleVue,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"You unlock rifles as you unlock ribbons. When you unlock ribbons, the option to buy them with silver appears allowing you to buy it. Save your money because bolt actions cost about 70,000 silver."

HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,ErithMinour,13,Sun Jun 7 00:03:34 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's the best way.  I've seen so many times where there's snipers all around an indoor objective.  If you park a distance off and try to advance you get picked off one by one.  5 guys just bum rushing straight through the front door works more often than you'd think.
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,drketchup,4,Sun Jun 7 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"I concur, W+M1 is an effective strategy if the spawn count allows you to throw wave after wave of men at the objective. It worked for the Russians at Stalingrad."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,hemansteve,7,Sun Jun 7 06:05:20 2015 UTC,"Im fine with that kind of driving, what I HATE is when I'm driving a jeep and the guy that gets in the gun does nothing but shoot for the entire drive. Like, dude, why, stahhp."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,MrQuicksilver,2,Sun Jun 7 02:00:31 2015 UTC,"Not about Jeeps, but I want to share this as I find it funny - it's nothing new, though; skip the next paragraph if you want.  So I recently unlocked and purchased the Panzer III, which is apparently made out of tinfoil. As usual, people love to spawn in the tank and start shooting the MG. I've started this new little ""rule,"" where if the person is picking off infantry, I'll turn to give them a better angle (free Armor MG XP for them), however, as soon as they fire on an enemy tank, I turn and haul ass away from the position. Once I find a new spot, I park backwards until they get out. Granted, I've been sworn at several times for this, but my average KD in the Pz. III has gone from around 6/7 to 25/1.  I also wish German bikes had the sidecar as an option so I could turn it off for my recon character. People hop on and start firing away. They die, and then everyone's looking at my position and I can't shoot for a while or they'll see me."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,TangibleLight,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:23:42 2015 UTC,"I feel you. It's the worst in recon vehicles. I know that some non-recon players can be amazing gunners, but I still wont drive until they get out. Not worth the risk"

HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,RealityAskew,3,Sun Jun 7 07:00:13 2015 UTC,"I've mostly given up vehicle spawning because of this. The exceptions are airfield map where there's tanks and snipers everywhere, and factory assault between B1 and B2. In those situations an all in bum rush in a jeep seems to have the most success. I also hate when I'm taking my jeep around behind a tank to pop some AT on it and some muppet spawns in on the gun starts firing at the tank then bitches that I got us blown up"
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,Kronic187,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"I can only assume it's a consequence of grinding. Silly really as it costs you money if it is your car.  Tip for new guys; when taking the free truck, drive in reverse so you don't get shot through the windscreen by small arms fire."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,hemansteve,2,Sun Jun 7 00:29:32 2015 UTC,"You can still get shot from the back. But you move slower in reverse, so you're an easier target."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,Zackory,2,Sun Jun 7 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree that you are an easier target for small arms. Purely from experience I have a better success rate in reverse than driving forward against un-scoped small arms.  The front wind shield provides a larger target and allows for chest shots. Restricting your target area to half a head that's moving evasively will give you a far better chance of covering ground than flooring the truck forwards at full speed.  In the end a tank will probably blow you up anyways but for what it is worth, I'll stick with what is providing better results as the truck is extremely useful for blocking doorways and bridges."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,hemansteve,2,Sun Jun 7 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"Iv sniped countless people driving the truck in reverse thinking theyre protected.  Im not 100% sure but i think u can also shoot from the sides of the window and kill them after penetrating. I just aim where the driver is supposed to be, and get a headshot."
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,Zackory,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:57:47 2015 UTC,I drive straight at tanks (when they arent looking at me) so that I can place my H3's on them and blow them up. then people spawn into my kubelwagon and start shooting the tanks with the machine gun (which does no damage to the tanks) which then makes the tanks turn around and blow us up. Consider that the cars you're spawning in may belong to someone who is trying to kill tanks or maybe it's too dangerous to park a distance away because of snipers and that driving right up to the point is safer.
HeroesandGenerals,38upmp,M4rcato,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:26:47 2015 UTC,"I personally love people who drive like that. One shot from my E8 gives me a rain of kills and points. Huzzah!

Each mech is behind what I'd say a 8 hour wall of solid grind to afforded one with a not to shabby loadout. Then you have to go buy the other 3 iterations to get it to a good level. That's what 5 hours of battle time per mech so that's 20 hours in the mechs around 16 to buy them(youd use earnings from the mechs to purchase the others) and congratulations you now have one competitive mech.... Hope it doesn't get neefed by pig. Now that you have a mech it's time for consumables which never earn there worth but are necessary for high level play. Sigh sorry about my rant still sheathing over how pig fucking ruined the mechworrior experience for me.

HeroesandGenerals,38pnec,Cubano07,0,Sat Jun 6 07:25:00 2015 UTC,actually that's 15 cents per hour not $7 to find the dollars per hour you divide the number of hours by the number of dollars so 463/70 = 0.15 which I would say isn't all that expensive when compared to say a AAA game like GTA or COD or Battle Field.

Grinding the BA ribbon with an unscoped M1903 is hell because I'm earning a maximum of 100 XP per game. I'm trying to snipe people with horrible iron sights... and if I can't headshot them, they can run away before I can even get my second shot in. Playing close/medium is no good because I get my face torn off by an SMG before I can even get a shot off. Stick 3 mods on the M1G and it's already leagues ahead of the M1903.  Level 11 BA ribbon just to get a scoped rifle? No thanks, I'll be rank 9 Recon before that (if I can even reach 110,000 XP in my lifetime)."

It's so frustrating that to invest some money in a weapon THAT RIGHTFULLY UNLOCKED, and then fill it with expense mods, and then get hit with an upkeep cost.  This breaks the game. How can something as essential as bazookas and weapon mods be so expensive?   That's not how you encourage someone to spend money in a game. When you nickel and dime your loyal players, they get resentful. When you do this to new players, they don't stay very long.  That's why I have only ever spent $15 on this game. I would love to spend more, but it doesn't feel like I am supporting a company for their hard work, I feel like I am being cheated and mugged for the money, since the game forces you to spend money to just keep using things you already spent credits on."

HeroesandGenerals,38nr3b,ourmartyr1,2,Fri Jun 5 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who has over 400 hours in the game i just wanted to address some of the points made by op.   Much of my experience unlocking and playing through the lower ranks of h&g is from a while ago when it was much easier to rank up through a ribbon. Currently i have 3 main soldiers one of each faction. My main loadout is ohk boltaction mines and stickies. I started as german so he is my highest rank halfway into becoming the first rank of general. Just on him i would say that i have about 200 hours but not focusing on unlocking everything. He has silver in most infantry ribbons and gold in a few. I can easily say that if you wanted to just max out every infantry ribbon with all the gun types before 200 hours sounds about right. But that 2 hours is spent simply grinding with no enjoyment and being basically no help to your team. Expect full days of driving in circles to level the driving ribbon and more days riding a bike in circles off in some hidden corner to lvl up for heavyset. To do this now would take well over 300 hours. Oh and this is for just one character. Try to get one of each faction and well.. Good luck. No AVERAGE player is going to spend this amount of time. Just not gonna happen.  As for costs.. This is something that used to be much better. While rockets and sticky prices have largely stayed the same they have never really phased me much but only because i use mines to avoid the cost. I lose utility as a price to save money. Heres where i think things make it really bad. YOU LOSE MONEY IF YOU USE THESE WEAPONS CORRECTLY. Take out a tank with rockets and no missed shots? Good job that cost you more money than you made for that kill. Sure it helps the team but thats a different issue. Nowhere is this more true than tripmines. Things just eat money. But lets talk about Mods. These used to be fairly priced untill about 2 builds ago. With the revamp of weapon mods costs to repair have spiraled out of control. A fully modded bolt action will run you about 1500 credits or more in a standard game for repairs. This isnt a big deal when at higher ranks your making 6-8k credits a game but tack on rockets and other costs it can cost you more than you made for a match. Its even worse using modded subs and mgs. Snipers are some of the worst ive seen for cost per shot but not on rocket level. Not sure how to fix this as guns already cost a ton just to buy them. I do think they ever should have raised repair costs.  When i comes to war... Well really with wars ending every other day or so i see no point whatsoever. Soviets were a huge mistake i think. Dividing an already smallish player base into more parts just well hasnt worked for the wars. Currently there is no way to fix the balance and no reward to even play war battles other than the games tend to be slightly longer when its not 1k against 125.  The youtube comment was spot on, every game i saw was rife with teamkilling but actually games i play dont seem to be that bad. Could just be that is what they thought people wanted to see and what the big name attracted. Not sure but def not good press in my mind.  As for subs and money, ive never put a dime into the game and well i really have no intent on it. Want to lessen the grind? Its gonna cost ya. Is it hurting the players? Hell fucking yes it is. For real though non sub players like me can be and do play very well in the game. Is it hard and take a lot of time yes. At this point i feel the need to stick to only my builds that i have already as the tome it would take to change is just much to long now. Every change that ive seen since the game came to steam has been to increase the grind none to lower it. Is it a better game now? Not really, its about the same. But lets all be honest the whole goal is to have people that arnt high level and havent put money into the game for those that have to shoot. A high rank player with money money better guns and higher ribbons is going to win most fights. Its gonna take a long time for a new player to get to that point or money to get you on the same playing field. The game isnt play to win(outside having a 2nd medal) but god damn if not paying hurts after a while.."

Was just curious if they would actually answer any of the questions I asked or just dodge them all with more sweet talk and smoke screens...  I see them posting on the forums and stuff, talking about they are listening lol.  I wouldn't be so pissed if the whole situation didn't scream Greed and Money.  What was it last month? they sneakily removed the 90 day veteran buy option (NO ANNOUNCEMENT PRIOR) , so you could only pay full price per month.  They said  ""no no were just re working some stuff and changing the way it works""  then when no one renewed their membership they reverted the 90 days of vet back saying ""oh it was more work than we were ready for so we put it back""  laughing my ass off.....Literally  They were prepping for this update.  Make people require 50%-75% more experience and take away the free month of vet 90 days would give!! Its Brilliant! Increase the load and raise the prices at the same time, No one will ever catch on. The money will flow like the diarrhea of the Buffalo"

I was like 280 hours into the game when it unlocked.   The ribbons I have still not gotten to level 12 are Tactical, Driver, and Chauffeur. That's with the 350+ hours I got into the game..."

HeroesandGenerals,38o9ny,MrQuicksilver,2,Fri Jun 5 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"Its all the side ribbons based around side activities. What was it, 42km of walking to get heavy set gold? If I walked to every point in every infantry game I would still be 20km or so away from getting the medal.   And stuff like tactical. capping a point? not hard. Killing enemies on the point? not hard. The issue is that it is very infrequent in most battles as the nature of the game is not a yolo shooter where you instacap points. It is a slow process and rarely is a frequent except for maybe paras. It is also not very xp profitable compared to just defending a constantly contested point from enemies is the best source of xp."
HeroesandGenerals,38o9ny,z1967,3,Fri Jun 5 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"It's a lazy way to increase ""gaming hours"" for customers without actually creating new content. It's a holdover tactic from the days of WoW and Everquest, but it doesn't work anymore because the online gaming market is fucking brutal. Those games were able to stuff their balls in the player's face for years because the only other options for us were games like Ultima and Runescape. That time is long past.  The only time you see behavior like this is with game developing companies run by inexperienced game developers or with a failing company looking to grab a few more bucks before claiming bankruptcy in the fourth quarter. I don't know which one Reto is right now, but I'm leaning on the fact that none of these guys has ever run their own company before. Nothing about their approach to game design looks polished at all; if they even have workflows for their separate departments, I shudder to think of how they look. That said, it should be worrisome that they don't have a single job opening in their jobs section.  The first thing they need to do is take a page from Riot's playbook and tone that grinding shit down a notch or two-thousand. Nothing says desperation and/or anti-consumerism like an MMO with artificially inflated content.  I would bet all my money that the decision to increase grind time further came about because someone at Reto did an analysis on gamer retention and found out that a large percentage of the player base left after reaching specific milestones in combat badges. Instead of realizing that was a sign they didn't have enough content and appeal to keep players' attention, the higher-ups decided that they just needed to increase the time it takes to cap out certain badges."
HeroesandGenerals,38o9ny,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Sat Jun 6 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"I asked for a refund on my academy general because I felt the inability to go back and earn the chauffeur ribbons (an essential commander badge) as a soldier (much, much, much faster) was borderline greasy. Generals didn't used to have badges, so academy-trained generals weren't a liability and didn't carry the negatives that purchasing an academy-trained soldier had. That was a precedent set in over a VERY long time of gaming.  Naturally, I've been told, word-for-word:   We never claimed that an Academy-Trained General would be exactly the same as a General that was levelled up from scratch.   So it doesn't really matter that they completely changed the power-potential of an item that costs about 50 bucks in the game, because they never said it wouldn't happen. Who cares that they already set a precedent for only soldiers suffering from that limitation, because they never openly stated it wouldn't happen.  So me, a solid supporter (financially and morally), has been punished for spending money on the game. You heard that right: paying for something in the game is actually pay-to-lose right now. I can't be the only one fuming about an academy-trained general purchase.  So learn from me--a player with hundreds of hours and dollars spent on the game--Reto doesn't care that they're punishing you for supporting their game, as long as they never said they wouldn't do it.  I guess there's a silver lining though, as this was also part of the support ticket:   However, we will be adding more possibilities for Academy-Trained Generals to unlock combat badges in the future.   Which I'm sure most of the veterans know what that means. For those of you new to this, here's a hint:  Option Two"
HeroesandGenerals,38o9ny,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:30:04 2015 UTC,I still think its SA rifle ribbon. as your basic starter rifle it should level up much faster to get people to the other intro guns like bolt action first mg and the like.
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Thatswaggyfeeling,3,Fri Jun 5 12:36:38 2015 UTC,I think the medic class is difficult to inject into any games these days. Death occurs too quickly in FPS games for a medic to be viable.  I do think an engineer would be a great addition though.
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Sat Jun 6 00:49:30 2015 UTC,Battlefield games done it and played a good role in Bad Company in my experience.
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,arulolfun,0,Sun Jun 7 11:56:18 2015 UTC,"What would the engineer do though? We already have a wrench and a combat badge that speeds up repairing that almost any class can equip. Since this game is supposed to be somewhat historically accurate and realistic, something like Battlefield engineers won't do. The closest thing I can think of is a WW2 combat engineer, and what they mostly do is just dig trenches, clear the path for a convoy, etc. And that only works in a game with fully destructible environments."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Incandescent_Souls,3,Sat Jun 6 05:06:18 2015 UTC,That's like saying an infantry is useless because a sniper already has a gun. There's plenty that engineers can be specialized for. Who says we need a fully destructible environment for them to see action?  I'm sure it's not impossible for Reto to give us the ability to build sandbag walls or lay out barbed-wire. Maybe the ability to build mounted weaponry or AA? The possibilities are endless. Engineers weren't just modern-day sappers.
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't really think of that. I'd imagine that they carry it in their equipment slots and put them down just like a mine but with a longer ""setting down"" animation, they'd be destructible as well. But to me, that seems like something they'd add sometime after the game is out of Beta."

HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,4,Sat Jun 6 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Medic would be cool, i was little surprised when i started playing and noticed they dont have medic class. Medic should get some of their own weapons, some kind of smg. They shouldnt be able to access SA or BA rifles. This way they would need to stay close to the action, where they are needed. Not sitting in forest sniping and healing themselves."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Wildpoop,0,Fri Jun 5 13:05:20 2015 UTC,I think that the SA would be pretty good for them. Definitely not any BA through :)
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Wildpoop,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:27:49 2015 UTC,"I really think even SA would lead to medics camping in woods, not in the front line.SA without modding would be fine. No one would camp with a three shot kill weapon."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Zeasnik,3,Fri Jun 5 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, SMG's and pistols. Having any kind of long-range weapon would negate the fact that the Medic needs to stick close and keep moving."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Wildpoop,0,Fri Jun 5 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"maybe not the M1 garand, but definitely the M1 carbine. That gun was made for it! They could negate camping by giving medics huge benefits exp for healing others."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,z1967,0,Fri Jun 5 14:55:53 2015 UTC,A bit one sided opinion. What would other factions use? Or would medic be US only?!
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Riinzler,2,Fri Jun 5 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well, they could introduce carbines for the Germans and USSR.   The C96 Model 1917 carbine for Germany.   The Soviets could get a Mosin Nagant carbine model 1944 or 1938.  Soviets didn't have a semi-auto carbine, so I am thinking instead this one just has a much shorter OHK range as far as BAs go and less accuracy to further drive down the range. German one might function similarly to the M1 Carbine in terms of stats and tactics."

HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,TangibleLight,0,Sat Jun 6 14:56:33 2015 UTC,They'd get more xp for healing allies than they would for killing. Maybe even decreased xp for kills?
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,KottonGamer,2,Sat Jun 6 07:11:52 2015 UTC,"With 18 player slots we need as much infantry as possible capping points.  Until they add more player slots into the battle, I will refuse any more additional classes to the game because Recons, Tankers, and Paratroopers are all supporting characters. Adding more will just decrease the number of infantry capping points.  It's simple enough for anyone to just find a medical box and heal. Just about every vehicle in the game can carry a medical box and be transported around the map."
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,MightyVanguard,2,Fri Jun 5 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. It really frustrates me on the three-way battles where there's still a 36 man player cap, so each side only gets 12.  Also, why doesn't it tell us who's what on the enemy sides? Why cant they use the purple/green/gray color scheme like in the Generals map, or something a bit more obvious like blue/red/neon green?"
HeroesandGenerals,38ntwz,Knightfall2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of the medic would be he keeps close the his teammates (mainly infantry), so in turn would help capping"

HeroesandGenerals,38mk6f,hemansteve,2,Fri Jun 5 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"Time is the simple answer to this. As you gain more familiarity with the maps, objectives, Panzooka spawns and natural cover between key areas for holding territory you will play a more relaxed and responsive game.  There is nothing wrong with camping and defending in this game, it gives more points anyway (unless V build has changed this).  When out in the open, use combat movement; from cover to cover, letting your stamina recover as you scout in with iron sights and pick off players.  As far as close combat, sounds like panic is causing you some errors so make sure you keep a steady breathing pattern when your heart rate jumps up a notch. Focus on hip fire shooting. You can practice on your long runs from the spawn point. Just pick close up targets along the way and use the mouse to focus the cross hairs over head sized targets and shoot them, no iron sights. This is how I get 1HK up close with un modded weapons in buildings whilst capping.  Keep in mid that every time you fire your weapon you let everyone know where you are. This is another key stagey to staying alive and an important reason to stick to combat movements and head shots.  Where is your natural camouflage?  Depending on what faction you play, each faction has a natural camouflage on the map.  For the Nazis, it's rocks walls, shadowed areas and forests.  For the Commies, It's brown bushes and thick forests and dark tree branches on hillsides and roof tops.  For the Yankies, oddly enough, the best place to hide is in small toughs of grass and weeds in the middle of open fields and in the limbs of low lying and knocked over pine trees (this might seem unfair but the USA have the best all terrain car with an MG on it, so you know...game balance).  Knowing the best camouflage for each map and the tools you have at hand (cars, bikes etc) will determine the best strategy for covering distance on the map.   Equip extra grenades; When you are new and have minimum tool, I'd recommend filling your 3 inventory spots with the cheapest grenades on both sides of your SA rifle. They cost nothing and can easily take out 2-3 guys capping at once delivering some decent XP. 6 grenades also gives you excellent suppressing power from behind cover and a thrown grenade can force players to run in the opposite direction to which you throw it which you can also then take advantage of.  Good luck, remember this game takes aaaaaaages to level up (especially after V build) so don't be in a race to cap .... focus on the present moment for your character and make the capture point a longer term goal and getting there the short term objective. Solve the issues of covering distance, suppressing the attack wave, clearing the area and then choosing a defensive position before capping."
HeroesandGenerals,38mk6f,ErithMinour,2,Fri Jun 5 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"This is great. I, too, am new to H&G. In fact, the night I installed it, the servers were down for the new big patch that has so many of you older players worked up.

Handing everything to a player right away might make them feel rewarded and happy, but I think getting familiar with the game and playing well to work towards gear is a better approach. Just my .2 cents, I do agree however that some grinds are unnecessarily long / misplaced."
HeroesandGenerals,38mk6f,KottonGamer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:03:11 2015 UTC,"To me it just seems the grind is too much. New people are stuck fighting Tiger tanks with m1 garandes for too long and they just quit the game. Its a Free to Play so its not hard to move onto the next one. I think maybe the initial stages and weapons should unlock faster, while the more serious ones should take some time.  Sorry to but in but theres my 2 cents.  I get alot of people telling me they quit because of constantly being under geared against veteran players."

It is important that you take your time with any rifles or snipers to get headshots when you're facing another one. You can get better rifles and equipment through leveling ribbons. Although, ribbon exp has been nerfed very significantly in the latest update, that I suggest you just practice your gameplay instead of focusing on leveling them as you will get nowhere with progression right now."

The way I did it on my german tanker is I played infantry for a good while and stole enemy tanks and leveled my light armor badge that way.   The only redeeming factor of the T-38 is that it is very low to the ground, making it easy to hide between moderate cover. It is also pretty fast, allowing for good infantry flanking. Kill infantry and jeeps/kubels and go after APCs if you see any. BE CAREFUL, even mounted mgs can penetrate your armor, it is literally almost paper thin.  Stay back while in battle, use the good turret rotation speed to check your flanks. Flee from pretty much any other tank you see. And good luck :)"
HeroesandGenerals,38n31d,z1967,2,Fri Jun 5 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Tanker here with a Gunner in gold. Got into this game because of tanks, it's my favorite thing to do. So I got a few tips for you:   Penetrations, penetrations, penetrations! Those are what will get you out of that shitty tier one light tank as soon as possible, shoot bicycles, motor vehicles, AA turrets, aircraft (who are we kidding)- anything that has ""armor"". If you can penetrate it, shoot it. Shoot vehicles that have been abandoned by your own side if you're feeling particularly desperate.  If you have Armor piercing ammo available as an upgrade for your tank, consider it mandatory. It'll let you kill light tanks in situations other than when the enemy tanker sticks his head out of his turret. It also improves your penetrations across the board for other targets- and penetrations are what counts. Fight like a tiger, a panther, or a cougar- that means being an ambush predator. Take the long way around your enemies and learn to attack them from unexpected angles, get your kills and then run away as fast as you can.  Be aggressive (move, because being timid and staying still once identified by the enemy is a recipe for death in a light tank- especially the tier one light tanks). If you stay still in a static defense, it gives them time to grab panzerfausts and formulate a plan to deal with you. If you're constantly moving and supporting your infantry, it's harder to attack you.  Be stealthy (take the long way to get to a target, driving down the road is hurrying to your own execution). If you are out in the open, enemy armor can and will pick you off with ease should the opportunity arise. I've killed German panzers by the dozen (literally took out an entire AT's worth of armor, and then some) because they kept coming down the same road and from the same predictable direction.  Don't get greedy (get your kill or kills and then move). Your tank won't survive an encounter with heavier armor, you need to move lest the enemy get a bearing on you. As soon as the fight ends (there's no more priority targets, such as armor or masses of exposed infantry), move away. Some people like to withdraw almost immediately after the opening attack and others are willing to press the enemy and try to finish off any survivors that may have found a rock to hide behind- when and how far you should go is something you learn with experience."

HeroesandGenerals,38lqy1,narcarsiss,2,Fri Jun 5 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"You get a certain amount of gold every month, and then at the end of the period you get some of what you paid in gold back. Example:  Lets say you put in 1125 gold. You get 40 gold per month, (6 * 40 = 240) and then after 6 months, you get back 1000 gold of you investment. So in the end you get 1000 +  240 = 1240.   This is just my opinion, but, it really doesn't look like a very good deal. Sure, you get a little back, but your funds are held up in limbo until that. But free gold is free gold"

Flank around their sides, stick to the forest, take the scenic route to their weak side. If you can get a couple good shots in before they do, you will win the fight. If your shots aren't damaging, you will probably have to get closer, as hard as that is.   As for getting to Med armor 5 quickly, find a nice sheltered spot and pick off infantry and empty vehicles. I personally would play staged skirmishes because the turnaround on deaths is much shorter than in assault, but if you find you like the leniency/movement space that a huge map gives you then play assault mode and find a protected camping spot  The Panzer IV is hits a little harder, but is still weak compared to the other factions. I know it's a little discouraging, but German heavy armor rules the battlefield. So if you stick with it until then you'll reap the rewards"

I think I was just feeling frustrated and wanted to vent a little bit.  So do you mean both of the Russian tanks and just the Lee for allied can two shot it? Also, if that's true, how does Reto consider this fair?"
HeroesandGenerals,38l7if,MrQuicksilver,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"Frustration is pretty much in the job description of German tankers. Frustration and persistence. And yeah, both Russian tanks, and the American Lee and Shermans have you beat stats wise I believe. But it is my opinion that the American shermans, at least the second one, are compensation for the fact that Germans have two strong heavy tanks while Americans have one not quite as strong one.   As for Reto considering this fair, I think that they were aiming more to equalize the disparities across all three levels of tanks as opposed two equaling it out at each level. It also could be, although I can't confirm this at all, That Reto is being historically accurate with these specific tanks and stats. I haven't personally played in a Tiger, but to me it seems like the stat differences kind of switch sides as you move from medium to heavy tanks. Skill can trump most stat differences. Sure, its obviously harder, but I've seen a Panzer III tear through a team of Lee and Sherman tanks, and I've also seen a pair of Tiger IIs put on the run for an entire game from by a good Sherman M4. Stick with it and you will learn how best to overcome the poor hand we're dealt"
HeroesandGenerals,38l7if,mickdude2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"That's not quite true... If the Lee/T-34 is using APCR, then yes it can two shot you, and if you're using the standard ammo, then yes it will take four shots for you. But you should NEVER use standard ammo. So it should even out to a three shot for you. Which means getting the jump on the person will save your life."

HeroesandGenerals,38jwu8,MrQuicksilver,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"The upgrades should last much longer than a match or two - unless you shoot an ungodly amount. The upgrade will still be as effective as it would be at 100% even if it needs repaired some. You can check the progress of the deterioration from your weapon upgrade panel (green bar progressively moves to red and gets smaller.)   So yeah, long story short - if you have the credits go for it every match."
HeroesandGenerals,38jwu8,homeshark,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"That's a personal preference. Your mods will still work until they are 100% broken, so you don't need to.

HeroesandGenerals,38hdds,narcarsiss,3,Thu Jun 4 05:39:00 2015 UTC,Buying the gun with gold will allow you to use that gun but nothing else.  So let's say you bought the MG42 with gold. You unlock it and can play with it. You will not however be able to use the mods until you unlock the LMG ribbons.  I bought a knife. It requires Close Combat level 4. I'm barely at Close Combat level 3. I still use it.
HeroesandGenerals,38hdds,TeleVue,2,Thu Jun 4 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"Unlocking a weapon with gold will definitely allow you to use that weapon.  That being said, all of the upgrades must be earned through the ribbon system.  If you are unlocking a new class of weapon, you will have to start fresh with a completely stock weapon.  However, if you purchase a different weapon in a class you already own, any unlocks that you have earned in that ribbon series will be available for the new weapon.  Example: Let's say I have Semi-Auto Assault ribbon 5, and no LMG assault ribbons.  If I purchase the M1918A2, I will be starting with a fresh weapon, and have no access to ammo or upgrades of any type until I unlock the appropriate LMG ribbon.  In contrast, if I were to purchase the M1 Carbine, I would have access to that rifle as well as ammunition, trigger, and sight upgrades.  Internals and barrels will still be locked however, because I haven't unlocked those ribbons yet.  Slightly off topic: I dislike the ""pay to win"" term.  It is not accurate in this game, in my experience.  I gold buy some weapons.  I also have other things to do with my time than grind out gear on a game.  Buying gold (and by extension weapons) allows me to spend more time having fun and less time grinding, and as a bonus it supports a good game that has brought me hours and hours of enjoyment.  Those weapons don't make me a better player, and I get killed by starter weapons on a regular basis.  They just give me something different to do, and help keep the game fun for me."

HeroesandGenerals,38hdds,dat_eric,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"Ribbons are earned through different actions.  Shooting a weapon, and hitting or killing a target with it, will earn you ribbon xp for that weapon class.  Ribbon xp will unlock different things at different levels, depending on what ribbon it is.  Some ribbons have more unlocks than others, so check before you start working on one and make sure it will be worth the time and effort.  For example, at Semi Auto Assault rank 1, you unlock ammo upgrades for semi auto rifles.  Further ribbons unlock access to trigger upgrades, internal upgrades, barrel upgrades, and sight upgrades.  Some ribbon ranks will unlock weapons or vehicles.  For example, Semi Auto Assault rank 5 unlocks the 1903, rank 9 unlocks the M1918A2, and rank 12 unlocks the M1 Carbine.  To see the unlocks click on the little ribbons in the upper left section of your main screen.   Each soldier has his own ribbons as well, so you will need to unlock things on every character that you want to use them on."

I ""paid to win"" with my bolt action when the Red Army was released. I wasn't a fan of doing it all over again, but with a subscription and the BA ribbon it only took me 2 days to get every mod I needed.

HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,LittleTrust,2,Tue Jun 9 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"As others have said, prepare for a grind.  That being said, the 1903 is a great rifle once you learn it.  Your sweet spot is about 100-200m from the enemy.  Make sure your stamina is full, as that affects accuracy more than you think, try to always fire from kneeling or prone positions, and take your time to place your shots accurately.  As for ammo I personally use the match ammo, as I have found that I get a lot more consistent damage due to the increased accuracy.  Every miss is 0 damage. ;) Bertie Clay helps in CQB, but honestly, unless your rifle is already modded to be a OHK, you should be trying to hip shoot headshots in that situation.  Your rate of fire is far too slow to count on a second shot.  For head shots, ammo type is irrelevant, so I focus on accuracy.  Pro tip:  As an infantryman, you can carry the 1903 with one pouch of ammo and a grease gun with no ammo pouch.  Normally, this wouldn't be a good idea, but you can equip the hoarder badge and you now have a bolt rifle with 55 rounds, and an SMG for a backup with two mags at a minimum with the bronze level.  This loadout lets you use your rifle at range, but when you are forced (or choose to go) into CQB, you have a weapon appropriate to the situation.  Bonus:  Repair and reload costs are typically 30 credits or less per match."

Bertie Clay is actually not necessary for OHK, although it will nab you some extra hit points against those heavy set users. It's more expensive and lowers your accuracy. Remember that.   My setup- http://prntscr.com/7cx1gw"
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,mickdude2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:09:40 2015 UTC,How much does that usually cost to repair per battle? I only make ~4k so I might need to cut down on some of those.
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,mickdude2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:44:06 2015 UTC,If you take off Bertie clay it will easily be under 2k. Just don't blow ammo.
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,Babadiboopy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"My latest build can be found here  In the latest patch they have nerfed the RoF from BA rifles though so you will also need a trigger now. Previously not having one was cheaper and made your gun more accurate. Have not looked into them too much yet, believe I have the fine hair trigger atm.  If you use the unscoped version you probably want the bertie clay ammo. It does way more damage and you often don't need the extra range since you won't do much 200m+ shooting.   I believe the ribbon XP got nerfed pretty hard last patch. Going for headshots is probably still your best bet. It's a painful grind :("
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,Zackory,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:50:48 2015 UTC,In the latest patch they have nerfed the RoF from BA rifles   The change log clearly says:    Bolt action RoF mods buffed
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,Babadiboopy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah they buffed the mods, and lowered the basic RoF.  So after the patch you need a trigger modification to get the same RoF you had before the patch without a trigger modification.  It's once again a sneaky stealth nerf by reto which they casually don't mention. Every patch it's the same damn story :/"
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,niikuu,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks to the new patch, prepare for a 100+ hours grind if you want to reach the OHK upgrades.  I don't think that you're doing anything wrong, it's all about dealing raw damage. You do get bonus XP for headshots, but it's basically a compensation for 1-shotting the enemy, who would otherwise give you the same XP for 2-3 normal hits."
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,Zackory,-1,Thu Jun 4 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"Practice Aim for heads Don't stay static: meaning don't just camp one spot the entire game, relocate, even cap points."
HeroesandGenerals,38h3yy,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,2,Thu Jun 4 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"This is mostly obvious advice, end-capped with a snarky piece of terrible advice.  Unless your team's zone of control has shifted, or you know you were spotted, moving is stupid. Moving makes you easy to spot, and it's less time you're spending on important things like recon and killing.  Anyone who considers constant relocation as a prerequisite for good sniping is either a terrible sniper, or has never been a sniper. You move when you need to. That's it.  Edit: I just saw the advice about capping points as a sniper. That's also awful advice. If the game is going so badly that a recon character needs to run in to save a cap zone, the game is almost definitely lost already. I'm sure there are plenty of Rambos here who think it's worth the risk (and that I just need to ""learn-2-play""), but they're dead wrong. If you're already close enough to the cap zone that you can beat your respawning allies to it, you're way out of position as a recon player."

In every fucking one of those threads you got to hear him say ""the sway is predictable, it's not random--just anticipate where it's going.""

At this point, I really don't know why Reto is making it take even longer. If you make a game so grindy that even paying money gives customers no hope of completion, people are just going to migrate to a new game.  I think they're trying to give the game a longer ""lifespan"" outside of adding new content. That used to work for Everquest/WoW/etc., because the market for online games was very skinny.  You simply can't get away with that anymore; the competition for peoples' disposable income is a fierce zero-sum game. If my free-to-play games get too expensive and grindy, I move on quickly. I'm not going to pay with both lots of money AND lots of time.  I have better shit to do with both of those resources than use them to reward a lazy and greedy game developer."

The goal is (as is also written in the public changelog) that it should take around 200hours for an AVERAGE, not super, player to reach max rank on a character including all necessary ribbons, unlocked upgrades etc without using boosters, vet.membership OR spending gold at all. We don't think that is unfair.   The ribbon XP did have some issues where a lot were WAY too easy to unlock and a few way to hard. We have normalised the values based on data from the servers. The plan is now to keep looking at the data and adjust values where necessary over the next days and weeks.   Suggesting boycotts, spamming support, leaving negative reviews, etc. will only hurt the game and force us to focus on those issues INSTEAD of looking at what needs to be done to improve the game.   We do follow our own forums closely and we are aware that many players dislike this change, but we'd prefer to work on a solution than having to take people off working on the game and have them spend days answering posts in a mio. different places.   /Reto.Robotron3000"

Granted, I don't just grind most ribbons, though every game I am in I am among the top 3 or so scorewise, do honestly think it is appropriate to force someone to ride a damn bicycle for 100+ hours just to get heavyset?

They set up the game for maximum grind to force spending real money. Progression is slowed to the point where the average player will never acquire the top items, hence there is no need to produce new content. No new content means no need to pay developers, and the game becomes a stagnant, but efficient cash cow."
HeroesandGenerals,38dukt,niikuu,2,Thu Jun 4 12:03:43 2015 UTC,Compare the way Reto is monetizing this game with the way Trion has monetized Rift.  What Reto is doing is beyond pathetic.  Trion gives you every reason in the world to spend money on Patron status and various other items for your character.    Reto is going for the extremely hard sell of making anyone and everyone grind NEEDLESSLY unless they pay money.

HeroesandGenerals,38cim2,william1134,2,Thu Jun 4 13:17:22 2015 UTC,Can't say that I am best pleased with the BA rifle buffs. I find myself constantly killed by OHK mods. Really annoying.
HeroesandGenerals,38cim2,M4rcato,2,Wed Jun 3 11:12:48 2015 UTC,"The bolt action rifles need to be OHK, in the time it takes to reload one or two shots, a submachine gun can empty an entire magazine. BA is high power low fire rate, while submachine guns are medium power for high fire rate, it's a trade off."
HeroesandGenerals,38cim2,william1134,2,Thu Jun 4 02:16:07 2015 UTC,I find it much easier to land one shot from a OHK than place two consecutive shots from a GAR.  Submachine gun is better if you don't know somebody is around the corner as you can instinctively spray them up. If however you know somebody is there a OHK is better in all situations as you kill them before they get to return fire.
HeroesandGenerals,38cim2,M4rcato,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:49:32 2015 UTC,"OHK is not better when you have more than one target, or the target is behind any sort of cover, usually if you miss the first shot you're dead. And then there is clearing houses/capturing objectives, in which case any BA is pretty garbage because it's so easy to miss a shot and then have the enemy on top of you in seconds"

I personally recommend mastering the BA, but if the sniper rifle is your only end game, save your credits and blitz to level 9."
HeroesandGenerals,38b66u,MrQuicksilver,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:43:56 2015 UTC,"Headshots. You get more XP and they are 1HK. When up close, use hip fire to put the cursor on your opponents head before shooting.  Cap where possible to work the Tactical ribbon for the pistols to have a back up for your bolt gun.  Mod your gun to a 1HK if you want to. My recon sniper is a 2HK. It's cheaper which allows me to throw suppressing fire from far away at times and I only go for head shots so still reap the benefits of a 1HK when they land."

HeroesandGenerals,38b66u,hemansteve,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:28:29 2015 UTC,Naturally using Gold for ribbon boosters and Veteran for the XP perks is handy too if you have more money than time.
HeroesandGenerals,38b66u,Babadiboopy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"I suggest leveling with an SA rifle. It's just so much more effective than a 2 shot BA. I had the same goal as you, rushing to recon asap, but leveling with a weak weapon is not much fun at all.  If you want to level quickly start by only playing skirmishes, shorter matches with the same XP as larger ones. You also gain credits faster this way and you will need a ton of them to buy/mod your sniper rifle later.  I spend quite a few of my games playing the hillside skirmish. Both  A and C can easily be defended from bushes up the hill from either point. Just sit there and claim all those easy defense points :)  Keep in mind that sniping is expensive and that without a veteran membership you will not gain much credits (perhaps even lose them). You absolutely need OHK mods if you are going to be a recon, or you will drag your teams down more often than not. I knew I wasn't going to be interested in other items so I went fully modded recon straight away but I wouldn't have had the credits I have now without veteran."

HeroesandGenerals,388s08,The_Real_Chomp_Chomp,6,Sat Jun 6 02:39:23 2015 UTC,Covertly decimating transport vehicles is a major tactical advantage.
HeroesandGenerals,388s08,nerdz0r,3,Tue Jun 2 18:44:55 2015 UTC,It's somewhat of a useful novelty. It one shots infantry so is very effective vs single players. For more then one I have to use cover to reload. It is extremely annoying vs light armor and trucks. Depending on how good the tanker is they look around for a wile for you while friendly tanks finish then.  The down sides are slow reload and limited ammo.
HeroesandGenerals,388s08,about929,4,Tue Jun 2 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"It is ridiculously over powered when used as anti air, which I feel is the most unbalanced thing. One hit and it's wrench time. A second hit leaves you with enough health that a pistol might be able to take you down. The ability to one shot Kubels is also frustrating. I sometimes refuse to attack against the russian on Airfield especially when it's mainly infantry/transport vehicles. A few guys with PTRDs and semi decent aim can completely shut you down from using vehicles to approach and the large open spaces to cover isn't exactly kind to advancing on foot."
HeroesandGenerals,388s08,LeetwoodMACK,2,Tue Jun 2 20:06:17 2015 UTC,At one point the PTRD was doing more damage to motor vehicles than light tanks were- you could knock out a kubelwagon in one shot. I don't know if that is still the case.
HeroesandGenerals,388s08,Kahzootoh,3,Wed Jun 3 08:42:52 2015 UTC,"It's ability to one shot infantry, easily take out transport vehicles and take out planes, using what i hear is pretty cheap ammo, makes it a useful weapon to me. The bazooka/panzershreck are novelties because although they have power, they have a fatal flaw (the insane price of their ammo) which makes them completely unusable. The PTRD not being able to take out heavy tanks is not a fatal flaw, it still has incredible value. In staged battle and especially war, being able to take out the enemies transport vehicles, aircraft, and light tanks helps your team in a very big way."

If the queue has 3 players waiting it should bypass the rest of the equation as people obviously want to play it.   Parablocking exists now because no one queues."

HeroesandGenerals,383fej,d3dlyhabitz,3,Mon Jun 1 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Well they are very subtle in the way they do it but the government definitely pays to get input on movies like American Sniper and Zero Dark Thirty. They insert propaganda and affect the feel of the movies. So for example at the end of the sniper movie you might want to go fuck up some middle easterners, or torture is handled like it's cool all of a sudden."

HeroesandGenerals,3826qc,dataCRABS,2,Tue Jun 2 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am a long time DOTA 2 player as well. I think from a community perspective, almost all MOBAs have a certain level of toxic community. This game has a great community so far because I think it is full of people passionate about skill based WW2 FPS and we all want the game to succeed. This game is as close to BF1942 as anything I have ever seen and for me that is amazing. As far as the UI, it doesn't break my heart or ruin the game for me but wow does it feel as restricting as possible."
HeroesandGenerals,3826qc,Zeasnik,5,Tue Jun 2 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"Silver - working towards - Gold ""Heavy Set"" on my Infantry Man. ""Gold Gunner"" on my Tanker with Silver ""Bombs Away"" on my Pilot.   ""Heavy Set"" keeps those nasty One-Hit Kill rifles from ruining my day. Gold ""Gunner"" keeps my SU-85 fighting and Silver ""Bombs Away"" makes those ants on the ground scurrying for cover."
HeroesandGenerals,3826qc,b1ghead3d,3,Mon Jun 1 09:15:36 2015 UTC,"Infantry:  Heavy Set + Camouflage with OHK or SMG + Frag + Stickies   Heavy Set + Tight Grip with LMG + Frag  Tanker: Gunner + Ghillie  Recon: Heavy Set/Ghillie + Camouflage   I love the no kill cam with camouflage and in my opinion is one of the best badges in the game. You can constantly jump the enemy and keep the battle at your pace without having to worry about vengeful players hauling ass to your exact location. Heavy Set is a close second if not better than Camouflage for me, I have survived with 1 or 2 bars of health and gotten some epic gameplay by barely surviving more times than I can count - plus it helps deal with OHK users. As for for the tanker, gunner is the obvious choice for faster cannon reloads and the 2nd badge probably varies with a lot of people, I sometimes take the hip % accuracy badge to help when I have to get out of my tank and fight off AT with my pistol, but in my opinion if it comes down to me having to get out of the tank/lose my tank I've failed as a tanker so I choose Ghillie to better mask and hide my tanks position."
HeroesandGenerals,3826qc,November_One,2,Mon Jun 1 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"On my infantry I use nimble and dynamite lover. This way I can sprint and run indoors without ppl hearing me (great for capping) and with another 3 H3's i can take out a total of 3 tanks before I need to rearm.  On my pilot I use bombs away and flak jacket.  On my tanker I use gunner and iron fist, the extra damage it does is crazy.  On my recon I use camoflaged and ghillie"

Potentially the most powerful badge, apart from/on par with extra explosives and extra life. Though I haven't yet unlocked Camouflaged, I can already tell that will be my most used badge for Recon (which is what I'm good at). Recon badge takes ALOT of time, so it really makes it worth while, putting the  hours in for the reward. I hope..  By the way, hi old friend. Come play some assault more often :)!"
HeroesandGenerals,3826qc,captainbuttercream,2,Mon Jun 1 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"Bolt/anti-tank guy  Gold Fast Reload  Silver Iron Fist, 15% increase damage to tanks  The fast reload works not only for the bolt but for the panzerschrek as well.  I can fire two schrek rounds in three seconds now. Beautiful. And the extra damage ensures that I can take out all tanks. Also my bolt is a one shot kill so it can be used in most scenarios including multiple enemies.  Assault guy  MP40 modded with sticky bomb and regular nades  Silver Grenadier  Silver Dynamite Lover  I can carry one extra nade and one extra sticky bomb. Very handy. With the sticky bombs tankers will try and eject before they blow but the extra damage ensures they will be killed as they can't eject and run quickly enough to survive. Then hey, free half health tank."

HeroesandGenerals,37y7vs,Ie24,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"It's very much up to your preference: Running around close quarters with a m1903 is pretty fun but remember that bolting takes time. So pretty much, if you miss your dead unless you got cover, except if your sniping on a long range. If you buy the ammo for the garand you got a two hit kill rifle with the obvious advantage being it's semi-automatic.  In the end I'd say try picking up a ohk rifle from a dead friend or enemy. If you like the feel of it, by all means go for it but the grind is pretty long until you unlock the stuff needed for OHK."
HeroesandGenerals,37y7vs,DeadlyNyo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:23:22 2015 UTC,Ok I heard of the ribbon nerfs too and I decided that the grind isn't for me. Should I buy the Thompson instead? How is the grind/performance of that?
HeroesandGenerals,37y7vs,Ie24,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"The grind for thompson isn't really that big, your only going to have to level your smg assault to 5 and even post ribbon nerf that's not hard. I think the cost is around 100-120k but the good thing is that when you have it its one of the best weapons in the game.  When it comes to ""Should I buy the thompson instead?"" again, that's something that remains to see for your self, but from what I've seen almost everybody loves and uses tier 2 smgs. They are simply very strong close quarter weapons and even quite capable above 75m when modded right. Also, your gonna want a thompson sooner or later to start playing skrimishes so you can rank up fast (remember: Never make your first character recon/para!).  Also, don't get turned away from the ribbon nerfs. They are claiming to be working out the ribbon problem. The question is just how long it will take."
HeroesandGenerals,37y7vs,DeadlyNyo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:57:52 2015 UTC,By never making your first char Recon/Para what do you mean?
HeroesandGenerals,37y7vs,Ie24,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"You need a reliable money maker: your just gonna end up fustrated if you got a recon (or any other role for that matter), because there are not enough battles around for recon and paras, and your gonna be stuck playing staged battles with limited respawns. Also, there are higher repair costs for roles other than infantrymen. So what I suggest: Level a new infantryman to what ever role you desire. It might sound like a pain, but I did that when I first started and it saved me alot of trouble.  Lets say for example: You would want to go play as tanker. Great. You go and switch over your first character to it. You have some fun and you unlock the second tank. Now here comes the problem: You do not have enough money to buy any tank or gear, and your running low on credits because of repair bills. And since you are stuck with a second character that has low soldier salary, your gonna be stuck having to level up that character and make money with him, until you can repair your tank. And that's with a stock M1G / Gewehr and just a nade. If you dont even buy a second character for going a spefific role, you are gonna have to be playing another infantryman in another faction.  I hope you understood. I'm not that good at explaining but that was the best I could.  tl;dr: Your gonna get large economy issues if you convert your first character to recon or any other role because your not going to have a reliable money maker."

This keeps you from overspending on shit.  After you gain some AT experience and learn a few things (shooting mines that you've placed near tanks to kill them, pretending to have stickies and inviting tanks to flee, right over your AT mine around the bend, etc) you can utilize the AT soldier for even less coin."

Getting smashed by tanks and not even having access to (not enough credits for) an AT weapon of ANY kind, and suddenly getting sniped by guys with scoped riffles was a bit ruff.

HeroesandGenerals,37qg1f,AlexStar6,3,Fri May 29 16:06:41 2015 UTC,I also found it difficult at first. You get used to it after like 5 matches.
HeroesandGenerals,37qg1f,Zackory,2,Fri May 29 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Pitch and Yaw should remain bound to mouse imo, it makes more sense for precision shooting (although I like having roll on mouse more, weird preference).   What does ""disengage"" do? Never pressed control because I didn't think it was for anything."
HeroesandGenerals,37qg1f,z1967,2,Fri May 29 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"With the current controls Pitch/Roll are Mouse bound, YAW is A/D and Throttle is W/S.  if you press and hold CTRL it makes WASD Pitch and Roll, but you lose Throttle Control and Yaw Control.  I'm not saying to take away mouse bound control, it's essential for precision shooting.  What I'm saying is to allow us to completely remap the keyboard buttons for better overall control of the plane when making wider manuevers.  It's nearly impossible to pull an Immelman or a Split S using the mouse."
HeroesandGenerals,37qg1f,Zackory,2,Fri May 29 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"if you press and hold CTRL you lose Yaw Control   While pressing control, you can yaw with the mouse."

Debug takes a little bit to get used to, but once you do, it's capable of doing whatever you need it to. Now the plane performance is a whole other story.   That being said, I'm not against them allowing us to remap the keys as we like. The fact that they haven't yet, probably says it's more difficult than I think it should be."
HeroesandGenerals,37r70t,WalkerPete,2,Fri May 29 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"Walker, your not alone buddy. I've played this game for a long time and I still don't have Heavy set gold or a character above lv 16. It's just a grind to get that Final Heavy Set. This ribbon was meant to be something that just happens over time as you run and cycle around. Its a reward for time ribbon that doesn't care how long you wait.  There is no real way of grinding it faster, and I never recommend botting or sticking controls together. Theres a reason you dont see many hackers in the game, They are watching you!"
HeroesandGenerals,37r70t,KottonGamer,2,Sat May 30 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"I would NOT suggest doing the circle or auto run techniques, I wouldn't be surprised if you got punished for it - and after such a long grind it would be an awful waste.   My infantry did not obtain heavy set gold until rank 15, and it does take discipline of not spawning vehicles every time and just running or biking to battle, when appropriate of course.  edit: I've also read before Reto has implemented a system to counter the auto run/circle idea by calculating the distance from A(where you started) to B(where you stopped), so running in circles would not be effective - but the straight lines back and forth across map would seem to be fine by this logic. Unconfirmed however because I couldn't help but feel guilty and wouldn't want the slightest risk of being banned for it."
HeroesandGenerals,37r70t,b1ghead3d,2,Mon Jun 1 12:26:07 2015 UTC,"I used bicycle and hold W+A then click enter. Opening chat makes the  buttons stick.

So basically queue up, go to spot, enter auto circles and then tab out/do something else for a while. 30h with veteran maybe? Just guessing."
HeroesandGenerals,37r70t,Bumpidump,6,Fri May 29 19:34:33 2015 UTC,It's bad game design when people would rather tab out to level up than actually play the game.

HeroesandGenerals,37psj1,Bumpidump,2,Fri May 29 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"The devs showcased some of the UI changes to the menu including the new icons for uniforms that will tidy the screen up and other features such as having unlocked and locked weapons in the same menu. Generally the UI has improved and looks less cluttered.  There was then some discussion on the strategy side of the game which went right over my head but along the lines of changing the process for battles that were 'unwinable/unplayable"" from one which involved an AI determination process which was being abused by para units to a new process which removes this game exploit.  I zoned out after that and went back to farming credits."

HeroesandGenerals,37hzmg,stressball_,2,Thu May 28 19:43:57 2015 UTC,I like that! Done that many times and its does need a bigger payout ... its very helpful for the rest of the team.
HeroesandGenerals,37hzmg,theolaf,2,Thu May 28 21:50:11 2015 UTC,Because theoretically they can just spawn right back into it and be in the same spot. Shooting a tanker out is usually a temporary set back unless someone blows it up after or captures it.

HeroesandGenerals,37hzmg,loki993,2,Sun May 31 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"All very good suggestions for the game and I like the idea of XP sharing for the amount of damage you do to the models. Although I'm sure it would be extremely difficult to code into the engine as it is right now; however it is definitely do-able overtime.  In addition to that, the voice acting suggestion is also awesome. I would like to see this come sooner, than later, the game is too silent for me at times when it should be chaotic with all that's going on. I would still like to hear footsteps and such but if there's tanks shelling the area maybe the soldiers saying shit about them would be nice to hear, add some more realism to the game.  AS far as the AA situation goes, yes it is a death trap. But learn to use it to your advantage and skillfully. Instead of shooting the plane when it's turning in for a bombing/shelling raid, fire at it after it comes out of the drop. In addition, you can frantically smash E (default) to get out of the AA before the plane drops in on you and shells or bombs you to smithereens."

In the span of about an hour the game went from very enjoyable to nearly the most frustrating thing I've ever played. Up to level 3 great, after level 3 apparently they turn the noob filter off. Getting sniped across map by tanks, 3 or 4 tanks that no one can seem to kill, planes you cant shoot down...oh yeah and snipers that can one shot you with a hit anywhere but the arm or leg....  And yes I agree about the AA...I jumped in one last night to try and deal with a plane and lit it up only to get impact angle too high and he proceeded to strafe me seemingly receiving no damage. He came straight at me, with seeming no regard to my AAA fire. The line I had on him should have been devastating...instead I may as well be shipping nerf balls at him."

However, it doesn't make the tiniest of a difference when you spawn and there are 10 tanks pummeling you from every which angle, and they're all using HE rounds so hiding doesn't actually do anything.  Somehow, and I don't know why, this only happens while playing against the US."
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,hansonlife,2,Wed May 27 13:00:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what to tell you if nothing helps then nothing helps I guess.
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,MrKilla-munjaro,4,Wed May 27 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean, and it's not just airfield. I spawned in on one of the smaller skirmish maps with like 10 other tanks the other day. I started a post about it (http://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesandGenerals/comments/36uxbi/unbalance_worries/) and you can see some people thought I was just complaining because I kept getting killed but its not the getting killed its the preposterous numbers of tanks!   They removed the cap when they introduced faction resources. I'm not entirely sure on their reasoning for it. At any rate its uncapped now and I think, particularly with tanks, this can really unbalance the game as you lose all your tanks really quickly and then have a tough time matching the enemy who can be more conservative and make their tanks last longer.   Personally I think we should go back to capping but maybe allow higher caps. Maybe 4/5 tankers to an AT instead of 3 (what it used to be)."
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,Silentway47,2,Wed May 27 10:39:17 2015 UTC,"I think it depends. I have these types of games and it does suck, I generally leave and find a new map. I'm not interested in simply being cannon fodder to help someone else grind. I do find them to be rare so I'm not sur eif this is something to be fixed or not. I do find the infantry on infantry fights ot be the most fun."
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,johnibizu,2,Wed May 27 15:11:56 2015 UTC,Some maps benefit tankers just like some maps benefit infantries or planes. Tanks are really not a problem imho(this is coming from a tanker). You just need 2-3 inf tank killers plus tankers to dominate the game. One is even enough to keep tankers at bay especially if your side is really pushing.
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,dataCRABS,-2,Wed May 27 09:22:59 2015 UTC,You are saying they aren't an issue yet you need 2-3 dedicated anti-tankers to kill just 1 tank. On most of the games I play there are 8-10+ tanks at any point in time. How are you going to say that isn't a problem? These guys who sit in tanks get 60+ kills with maybe 2 deaths at the max. It's way too unbalanced.

HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,Agreenarrow,1 point,Wed May 27 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's clear this up. Tanks are not op. Assuming you are in staged mode, both teams have equal amounts of tanks at the beginning. If you get into a match where, for example I got into one today. As a 38(t) I got 10 tank kills and 3 deaths both teams had roughly 24 tanks, and about 13 tank drivers. The main tank combat was over within 10 minutes and after we had won, the enemy had no tanks other than a few hiders. At which point we met no anti-infantry resistance at any point in the game. We quickly cleared the objectives from afar using HE and moved in. I suppose this is just a long winded way of saying its not the games fault, or a ""balance problem"" if your beginning tank drivers suck. If the enemy had one the tank battle it would have been the same thing, however the other way around. My point is, get some land mines a Jeep and try to flank tanks instead of taking the main road with a panzerfaust only to find that the front armor was too thick.   Also if you find your are being attacked from HE 90% of the time staying away from entrances/windows saves your life  Edit: Also Russian light tanks are complete shit, so that explains that"
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,niikuu,3,Thu May 28 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that tanks are OP.  My point is that out of 18 players, there should not be 13 tankers. I think that the cap per match should be reinstated to say, 6 or 7 maybe.  My anti-tank loadout consists of TM42, a Gaz-67, a PPSh and grenades. And this works very well, but it's extremely expensive to get blown up as soon as you spawn by 10 tanks all shooting at you at once."
HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,Agreenarrow,2,Thu May 28 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"My point is that out of 18 players, there should not be 13 tankers.   Exactly. In these cases the battle is boring even for the tankers."

HeroesandGenerals,37f2ae,LambdaZA,1 point,Thu May 28 14:28:28 2015 UTC,This is exactly why there needs to be a cap. Having thirteen tankers spawn at once at crazy and it just becomes silly. Especially since 5/6 decent tankers on the other side can just burn through all the tanks easy and then the game becomes difficult. Granted you can overcome it with anti-tank stuff and if people were good you wouldn't get in this issue but I just feel like uncapped tanks is causing more issues than its worth.

HeroesandGenerals,379cvd,Mrburgerdon,1 point,Fri May 29 08:01:40 2015 UTC,"My main German infantryman has an infantry supply crate on his Kubelwagen, because it usually ends up being a semi-barricade of sorts during a shootdown, or a mobile medical centre.  My APC has an anti-tank supply crate, because I rarely pull out my APC, and when I do, the reason tends to be tanks blasting our infantry, and a huge necessity to flank the tanks (hence, driving the APC from far around and hiding it behind enemy lines).  My motorbike is usually a hit&run vehicle, so I tend not to put anything on it. I'd rather ride to a stationary medical supply crate that is surrounded by sandbags than stop my motorbike and use a crate from its back, increasing the risk being shot.  P.S. I really suck at being an effective infantryman though  TL;DR Crates are good but depend on situation; and my infantryman a better chauffer than fighter."
HeroesandGenerals,37908y,Neralm,4,Mon May 25 21:20:59 2015 UTC,The BT-7 needs an upgrade to be more maneuverable and faster to compensate the thin armor.
HeroesandGenerals,37908y,creampiefilledcar,3,Tue May 26 06:17:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, if my Pz.II could not flip over after hitting some fenceposts that would be fine and dandy.   On a non-physics related note, anyone got strats on taking out Chaffees with the Pz.II? I already got APCR but that isn't quite doing it vs. the Chaffee. I am either getting deflected shots or two hit by the damn thing, turret moves so fast. Should I just avoid them till I unlock the 38(t) or is there a secret I can't quite figure out?"
HeroesandGenerals,37908y,z1967,2,Tue May 26 21:31:34 2015 UTC,Avoid until you get the 38t. Then avoid slightly less :)  Chaffees dominate the light tank class IMO.
HeroesandGenerals,37908y,downvotesfordinner,1 point,Wed May 27 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you guys are talking about. I rape all enemy light tanks in my panzer II, and I actually prefer it over the 38(t).  The panzer II is cheaper, it is absolutely amazing at anti-infantry, and you can destroy all light tanks if you unload an entire clip on an enemy tank and land most shots (given you have APCR). The Chaffee is rarely, if ever, a problem for me. However, it should be noted I have golden gunner badge (I grinded all the way to Heavy Amor) and a wrench, which help a lot. Being able to reload faster, and get more shots in than your enemy, is pretty important."

The Chaffee dominates the game for most people because it's considered a ""light tank"" which is where most people start their tanking career using, unless they want to pay premium for high tier unlocks."

HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,A_Misguided_Llama,4,Mon May 25 22:37:07 2015 UTC,If you play mid to short range i recommend an smg.  Work your way towards the tommy.
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,Zackory,2,Mon May 25 23:25:29 2015 UTC,I've actually unlocked that too. So you'd say go thompson over BAR? I only have the credits for one.
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,Zackory,3,Tue May 26 00:00:00 2015 UTC,"The bar is from mid to long range.  You're saying you're an aggressive player, charging points and stuff. So an smg will serve you better."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,woohooguy,2,Tue May 26 00:04:48 2015 UTC,"As Zack mentioned go SMG, the ability to hip fire in tight quarters is vital."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,DLStark,3,Tue May 26 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'm running a fully upgraded BAR.   This is just my opinion, and I just started the game last week. Usually have good results though, as it's nowhere near my first FPS.  Good: Mid range it's pretty accurate if you tap-fire single shots. You can get it to 2hit KO to the chest, but only at LMG ribbon level 9. It feels like I have the same effective range as a SA rifle. If compared to a Garand, the 20 round mag is great. The upkeep doesnt break the bank. I do have vet active, but I profit every match.  Bad: Compared to a SMG, 20 round mag is shit. The recoil, even when bursting, is severe enough to obscure your targets. So any kind of deflection shot, or if someone is ADADADAD strafing, you can lose them rather easily I've found.  It feels like the weapon is very clunky when you stop sprinting or swap to it from another weapon, and takes longer to fire than other weapon types.  I think the BAR is a solid weapon, but frankly, I wish I just grinded out the Thompson first."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,1 point,Mon May 25 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"The BAR is really solid. I prefer using it like a semi auto rifle, getting tapshots from range to the torso or head, then moving closer and spraying people down in 3-6 bullet bursts at close range.  The m1919 is an absolute beast though, it has good recoil (Making it much easier to control than something like an mg42) and also does great damage. Only downside is it's shitty sight, ugh it sucks."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,RetainRadiation,2,Tue May 26 07:40:51 2015 UTC,"The BAR is basically a 20 round automatic Garand. I find it much more devastating than the Thompson, and I use it everywhere. I can be fire support or rush in and attack if I want. The 1919 is definitely just fire support, but I find the BAR the best gun that I have used."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,DavidaStein,2,Tue May 26 00:56:51 2015 UTC,I play as the Soviet Union but whenever I find a BAR on the ground I grab it as fast as possible. That thing is glorious.   Thanks for the downvote I guess.
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,william1134,1 point,Tue May 26 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"I have the Thompson and it is a good gun in CQB but I think with the recent BAR/LMG buffs, the BAR is now potentially the better weapon.  Yes it has a smaller mag, but it takes less bullets to kill. I think for me the Thompson is too gimped at range, whereas the BAR is more suited towards being an allrounder."
HeroesandGenerals,379a8k,b1ghead3d,1 point,Tue May 26 08:34:41 2015 UTC,"I suggest the Tommy gun hands down, M1 has the advantage at mid-long range but anything closer than that the tommy gun trumps both. It's not nearly as hard to control as everyone says. A 'pro' SMG user can solo entire teams funneling into cap points if you're good. The BAR will leave you hanging with its short clip and reload times."

HeroesandGenerals,377lew,Gourizaga,2,Fri May 29 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"This seems to be trending across H&G and frankly its getting really annoying with so many people running around with BA-Rifles. Too many people now are sitting back and sniping with BA Rifles rather than taking objectives.   My question is why do you want a OHK rifle?   The excuse behind BA-Rifles being OHK is to make them viable but then again, why were they replaced to begin with? They shouldn't be any more powerful than the SA Rifles, maybe just more accurate at range.."
HeroesandGenerals,377lew,Silentway47,2,Tue May 26 16:38:21 2015 UTC,Imo some people like the finesse the playstyle takes with a BA rifle and with it being OHK it makes it viable.
HeroesandGenerals,377lew,loki993,2,Wed May 27 05:49:01 2015 UTC,What do you mean finesse? Honestly people get it because its a point+click=win rifle. It takes very little effort to use and most engagements are medium to close range anyway making it even easier to aim and hip fire with.
HeroesandGenerals,377lew,DeckerR,1 point,Wed May 27 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"It takes more than little effort, most times once you miss you may be dead before you rechamber, it's a high risk high reward type gameplay, especially upclose if someone has an smg. Thus it takes finesse to really use properly as much as some might not want to realize it.   If it was not OHK then you have very little chance up close vs an smg with players of equal skill. Plus another aspect is the damage from the guns isn't very realistic in H&G and if you are a player coming from Red Orchestra where weapons have realistic damage values then a bolt action modded for OHK is just about your best bet."
HeroesandGenerals,377lew,Silentway47,-1,Wed May 27 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"As someone who uses a OHK Rifle with my recon. My hip fire shots have killed people far more than they killing me. In my opinion, you should have no chance up close. Otherwise whats the point of the smg? You are trying to justify balancing the weapons when in realty they should be used for their purpose.  Bolt Action rifles should have the exact same power as SA-Rifles. bolt actions in my opinion should be the starter weapon and you upgrade to an SA Rifle. That makes more sense. BA-rifles should really be one of the worst weapons in the game. Thats why they were replaced in real life.  I cant stand being in a house and opening up on someone with an MG42 to have them on shot me in the arm..."

HeroesandGenerals,377lew,Chuck357,0,Wed May 27 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"If you want realism, this is the wrong game. In real life you don't float for 3 seconds when you jump. In real life you don't eat 4 shots from a pistol and walk away. In real life you don't respawn.   It's a game. Balance is more important than historical accuracy. Every time."

The only time armor is useful is in situational moments where HE shells might some in handy but otherwise anti infantry countermeasures should be set in place   sry but that's simply not how war works. tanks are the best counter to infantry (they were invented to do exactly this btw). it's totally fine to spawn a light tank against infantry when it's basically a sniper with an engine that can only be killed closerange.  not spawning armor against paras? you kiddin right? that's the freakin best-case-scenario anyone could get, farmin enemies that can't kill you.  i know, it's hard sometimes, people can be retards. but don't assume things that are just incorrect, it always boils down to the fact that some people are not suited for teamplay"

However as of late in most situations end up with our tanks having little to no infantry support and more often than not being spawned recklessly like for example, people were spawning light tanks last night (panzer 1's and 2's mind you) against enemy tank destroyers when they could have sat back safely and began to take out enemy aircraft but they didn't and it ultimately led to our defeat because of lack of skill/communicaiton and common knowlege that anything below the 38(t) is pretty much useless unless against anything except enemy light armor, infantry, or aircraft."

It's why tank and other support ats should be added to the fight after it's full, because if there's a light tank at you get 8 guys that MM queued for tank only and they will not switch to inf because they waited for 20 minutes for a fight."

HeroesandGenerals,376qey,Leto2k,1 point,Mon May 25 19:34:24 2015 UTC,next week pending unforeseen problems
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,_tethtoril,7,Tue May 26 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"I'm like rank 8 with melee, and I can tell you it was pretty much hell to get there. The only sure way to get kills with it is to stand as close as you can to a person that isn't moving at all and headshot them with it. If they really are fixing it next update I will be happy."
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,Zackory,6,Mon May 25 11:06:13 2015 UTC,They confirmed it on the latest livestream.
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,Heavyweaponspoof,3,Mon May 25 11:46:27 2015 UTC,About how many kills did you need to get to 8?
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,about929,2,Mon May 25 17:29:03 2015 UTC,All of them
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,_tethtoril,1 point,Mon May 25 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't count, but if I had to guess, it would probably be around 100?"

HeroesandGenerals,376qey,M4rcato,1 point,Thu May 28 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can just take out your shovel and swing it while walking to your next point and you'll earn close combat points, so that makes it a little easier right?"
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,_tethtoril,1 point,Mon May 25 14:56:21 2015 UTC,can you really? that would make it much easier
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,great_gape,1 point,Tue May 26 01:04:26 2015 UTC,Much like real life and not like OP knifes from games like COD.
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,_tethtoril,1 point,Tue May 26 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Don't get me wrong, getting knife kills in H&G are extremely satisfying. It's just really hard."
HeroesandGenerals,376qey,Beardalelist,3,Tue May 26 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"The next update is overhauling the melee system. As someone that takes great joy in melee in this game, I'm ecstatic. It'll have soft aim so that you no longer have to have the cursor placed on the body part and the attack speeds will be split into two categories - swinging, or blunt, weapons, and sharp-edged weapons. More info can be found here.    From what I've read on the forums and here, the animation currently serves no purpose. When you attack, there is a fixed ray that protrudes from the player character's head, or cursor, that does 60 points damage. This explains why the weapons also don't have collision, currently, as they're all just aesthetic. Again, though, I've just picked that up from very old posts, back when third person was still a thing."
HeroesandGenerals,378b36,makehersquirtz,3,Mon May 25 18:23:11 2015 UTC,Why is the link to google.com?

HeroesandGenerals,376xll,Zackory,1 point,Mon May 25 11:48:37 2015 UTC,Okay so it fluctuates then? I can check back every week or so and maybe find it at a higher interest rate?
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,Zackory,1 point,Mon May 25 12:09:56 2015 UTC,"Im assuming so, because before people didn't know about it that much, so no one bough it."
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,DavidaStein,1 point,Mon May 25 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"They don't actually fluctuate week by week, only when they release new bonds. Then they'll possibly have a different interest and face value."
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,M4rcato,2,Tue May 26 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"giving up all your gold for 6 months with a profit of 65 gold, which has the value of about 30 cents or less. Doesn't seem worth it to me."
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,mickdude2,0,Wed May 27 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"The prices are not set in any particular way- supply/demand means little to the developers. That being said, they set the price based on how many people utilize the warbonds. They don't want too many people becoming too rich, because then it undervalues the weapons.  Honestly, think about it. 65 gold for letting your gold sit there. That's an awesome deal imo."
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,mickdude2,1 point,Mon May 25 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's assuming I will still be playing the game in 6 months. If I am, then I'll have made 65 gold (that's not even close to enough to buy anything) and if not, then I've wasted the opportunity to use 1175 gold while I was playing.   It's not like the weapons / camo's can be sold through the community like skins in CSGO, so I don't see how them giving people a little extra reward for buying bonds would de-value anything.   Sure the argument could be made that by giving a high interest bond would reduce the amount of money that player would spend in the future, but for me personally, I would be much more inclined to put a good amount of money into the game just so I have the steady income of gold. Otherwise I'll just do what I currently do and not spend anything."
HeroesandGenerals,376xll,mickdude2,0,Tue May 26 02:58:02 2015 UTC,"The thing about this game, especially when you get to the point where you'll need to start investing; You have to plan months ahead. Ask yourself ""What will I be doing tomorrow? What will I grind?"" Then continue to do that. That's how you get to being an RTS and FPS heavyweight.  Or, if you simply can't be arsed to have some patience, don't bother with it."
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,Terryfrankkratos,12,Mon May 25 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"I know that sniper camo is good , because you really wanna blend in . But for infantry i think is a waste of gold really , 90 % of your time you'll be storming in to cap points . My personal opinion tho"
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,Neralm,4,Mon May 25 00:59:18 2015 UTC,"The dark German uniform is one of the best stock Camo uniforms blending well in shadowed forest and against rocks.  I would advise on saving your money and sticking with the stock uniform unless you just want a bit of individuality on the battlefield.   Also, sniper Camo only helps with the appropriate badges, Camouflage and  Ghillie. Without these you will be spotted after a shot and marked for a tank to take you out."
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,hemansteve,2,Mon May 25 04:36:22 2015 UTC,I may follow your advice and buy just to stick out because there isn't much you can buy for the amount of gold I have(nothing that I don't have already or don't want/need).
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,smit0183,3,Mon May 25 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with Terry, I personally went with oak leaf for that reason but really there is no other use than sticking out and aesthetics for any of the infantry camos."
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,hemansteve,2,Mon May 25 10:57:34 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Another great way to stand out which is also really cheap on the Gold is to rename all your weapons. You can send a really personal message to all your victims this way ;)
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,lordaddament,3,Mon May 25 05:14:45 2015 UTC,I renamed my OHK mosin to AWP
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,TeleVue,3,Mon May 25 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"I have that camo on my main character. I feel special because I'm a different color.  It's really just aesthetic but since I'm going to die, I might as well be different from everyone else."
HeroesandGenerals,375e0j,November_One,2,Mon May 25 05:26:11 2015 UTC,We all want to feel different sometimes and a weapon named 8===o can't always get that across :)

HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,showman_101,3,Mon May 25 21:28:19 2015 UTC,They don't arbitrarily ban people. They have recordings and logs they review and if something isn't right its usually obvious.
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,showman_101,3,Tue May 26 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"Take it as a compliment, and move on. If people think the only way you can do that well is with hax, then you must be a pretty good damn player."
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,mickdude2,2,Mon May 25 07:50:27 2015 UTC,"Well, what happens when reto get false reports?"
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,Silentway47,1 point,Mon May 25 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"Chances are they will ignore it, and if they don't you can send them a quick letter explaining your scores which aren't that uncommon for snipers."
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,Silentway47,1 point,Tue May 26 01:43:10 2015 UTC,"Reto gets thousands of reports a day, mainly from morons who think anyone who killed them is hacking. You think thousands of people a day get banned, or their accounts frozen? Reto has a gauntlet of tests they run on accused hackers. If you're not hacking, you have nothing to worry about."
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,Silentway47,1 point,Mon May 25 21:52:32 2015 UTC,"Depends I have seen plenty of matches where a player had nothing but head shots. Literally 25+ head shots. They were banned and I have the email saying they were.  A high K/D ratio doesn't usually raise suspicions. Its the manner of the kills that people question.  What's curious about your comment is why would your own team report you? Typically people report a player that's killing them not someone who is helping, I almost never notice the kills from anyone on my own team. Since you can't read enemy chat, what makes you think they were talking about you?  Perhaps you are hacking and trying to figure out how to circumvent the system. The fact that you are even worried at all raises further suspicion."
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,GalacticAndrew,1 point,Tue May 26 16:45:28 2015 UTC,"If I was truly hacking, why would I post anything here? I posted because that is exactly what I found confusing is my own team talking about it over chat. Since I was the only one with over 30 kills near the end of the match (krauts had one around 25) I figured they were talking about me when they said ""guy with the 31/4"".  I did clarify that what I was in the dark about is reto's process in weeding out the genuine reports from the unreasonable ones. To which I found your other comment helpful."
HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,NotZach_,1 point,Thu May 28 13:38:28 2015 UTC,"It's quite odd indeed which is what raised my initial red flag. To be honest, 30 kills a match is pretty darn common. I am rarely in a match where a few people don't get them especially snipers and tankers. They always have high kills. I've had 45 kill matches with my MG42 so its not at all uncommon.   What did you say to your teammates?   EDIT: To answer your question; many people who commit foul will sometimes try to double check to make sure all their bases are covered and present themselves as a potential harmless victim. It's a common strategy. It's kind of like those conversations that start with ""So I have a friend who..."""

HeroesandGenerals,375ovx,GalacticAndrew,1 point,Thu May 28 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I agree then, likely new players who are not quite familiar with the game yet. They will review the logs and such and you will be ok."

HeroesandGenerals,3756i1,Neralm,3,Sun May 24 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"What the others said.  There are three types of recon assault teams. Foot recon, motorized (bikes) and mechanized (scout cars). You have to have your vehicle equipped and be in the. appropriate assault team to spawn the vehicle you want.  Works the same with infantry. I have all three (kubel, bike and apc) equipped and I have to switch to whichever assault team has the vehicles I want.  Some matches may not have the assault team type you want. Ie only mechanized or only foot recon   Edit ps: r75 flips easy. Release and coast on uneven terrain"
HeroesandGenerals,3756i1,Banyamulenge,1 point,Mon May 25 06:17:10 2015 UTC,to spawn the sdk you need to be in a mechanized recon assault team to spawn the bike you need to be in a motorized guard assault team
HeroesandGenerals,3756i1,Zackory,2,Sun May 24 23:54:12 2015 UTC,Motorized recon is bike. Moto guard is bike. Mech recon is ivf.
HeroesandGenerals,3756i1,mickdude2,1 point,Mon May 25 00:21:28 2015 UTC,"basically what you mean is to look at the bottom right corner using the arrows for an infantry assault team ?   But if i understand correctly thats an infantry , so it will spawn my infatry not my recon . And the thing is , sometimes im able to spawn with my bike , i just dont understand whats the reason behind it ."
HeroesandGenerals,3756i1,Zackory,1 point,Mon May 25 00:09:31 2015 UTC,Yes keep going left and right in the bottom right hand corner.  There are variations of assault teams: you need a particular one to spawn each vehicle.  Like you got regular guard assault team and motorized guard assault team. you need to be in the ladder to spawn the r75.

HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,Neralm,1 point,Sun May 24 18:02:17 2015 UTC,It zeroes your gun to where you are aiming at
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,JonSnowwhite,2,Sun May 24 18:14:58 2015 UTC,Didn't know this tip. They only mention adjusting sites on Direct Fire Support Weapons.
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,LongJohn1992,1 point,Sun May 24 21:42:59 2015 UTC,Has anyone tested if it actually works at Intended? I've had the 300m work Perfectly at 10 Meters. The 100m even seemed to shoot a bit under where I was aiming
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,Scatcycle,1 point,Mon May 25 00:16:36 2015 UTC,"Space bar definitely autoranges the weapon. If it is set to 300 or 400, I'll miss things at 100m. At 10m I think it would be pretty hard to miss anything.   Just remember there is a slight delay after hitting space before you can fire. Any sort of obstruction will have the autorange focus on the nearest obstruction--so point wisely.  I'm on my last badge to get to camo--can't wait.  I also mine the hell around my area but find that teammates can be stupid about mines--either killing themselves or shooting at them. So lately I just go with a pistol or even just extra ammo."
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,aMusicLover,2,Mon May 25 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"I also played around with carrying anti-personnel and anti-tanks mines, but honestly use the pistol far to often to give it up.  Plus with it being fully modded, I get some amazing CQB kills with it. :)"
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,Silentway47,1 point,Tue May 26 20:00:22 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just me but I definitely see a difference.  This fact is constantly reinforced when I shoot at someone 3 times in a row and miss.  That's when I notice my range is off and after doing the auto-range thing I hit them on the next shot. To be honest I'm not the best shot in the game but I make up for it with technique. :)  SSG_Black
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,Neralm,1 point,Tue May 26 20:02:05 2015 UTC,I'm assuming this is for unscoped rifles because ive never zerod my rifle and have no issues hitting long range targets.
HeroesandGenerals,373dnz,Neralm,1 point,Tue May 26 17:03:08 2015 UTC,So for long shots you need to adjust the range of the scope.  You can automatically do this by pressing the spacebar when looking through the scope at the target.
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,Scatcycle,3,Sun May 24 17:12:54 2015 UTC,The devs changed the grind so it takes a looooooog time. I used to be a short grind.
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,GalacticAndrew,2,Sun May 24 22:05:54 2015 UTC,This must be it. Damn that's unfortunate. He was so mad when he looked at his American character an saw he was farther than his Russian character ahaj
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,DeckerR,1 point,Sun May 24 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"They want more people to give them money.   Pretty typical with 'Freemium' games. War Thunder used to be an easy grind as well, then they made it take about 10x longer to get anything."
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,Memorizing_Fallout,3,Fri May 29 09:49:14 2015 UTC,"Did he Play on vet or something with boosters? Because I had like 100 hours before I got to para. Then again, it was my first FPS, and I sucked."
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,Le_Fapping_Aardvark,2,Sun May 24 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the game is a serious grind. Veteran membership and ribbon boosters can help offset this, but it is a proper grind.   Play staged battles to rank up fast- they end quickly and pay the same. Try to play with friends and roam around capping points and killing enemies - this generates a larger profit.  For this I would suggest a loadout of an SMG (preferably the second tier e.g PPSH) with grenades (Go easy on these - only use them to clear rooms with multiple enemies. If needed, you can also run the mines to kill tanks, or just grab a faust  A final note - if you switch to para and the assult team you are playing in is deafeated, you won't be able to switch to a new one, so you'd better hope the battle finishes before that - otherwise no paycheck."
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,Silentway47,1 point,Sun May 24 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very long aha. And yeah so basically if I'm recon on my last life, I gotta go hide and not die to get money ahah."
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,MrKilla-munjaro,2,Sun May 24 22:15:53 2015 UTC,How old is his account?  I had a Recon unit in Alpha and when I logged back in I still had him but he was only rank 3. If I started a new recon from scratch I'd have to grind to rank 9. Perhaps he had his para before? Even now my recon is only rank 6.
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,November_One,1 point,Tue May 26 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"I know people say you make the most money off of infantry but my top four characters are Tanker Recon and Para and Plane and I make reasonable money (not on veteran). I find the game much more interesting when I can switch between the various roles. Having said that I've logged four hundred hours on HnG now but I have a tanker and pilot in every faction and I have every kind of German soldier. If I put all my time on one or two soldier's I'd be alot further but I like the flexibility of switching assault teams several times a game if I want to! Overall I'd say don't be constrained by efficiency of earning money, you'll earn enough for what you want eventually and the game is supposed to be fun for you! Not a job to grind money :P"
HeroesandGenerals,373w38,MrKilla-munjaro,2,Mon May 25 08:57:54 2015 UTC,Well aslong as you make aure 1 soldier is active for 50% of the time in a match you will get paid. But if you switch too much you will not get your reward
HeroesandGenerals,3731iw,malu21,3,Sun May 24 12:02:17 2015 UTC,This might be a noobish question from a newer player but just wondering if its worth it to shoot at planes with my normal rifle? Sometimes I'll take a few shots at low flying planes and get the armor penetration message but is it really worth it to keep shooting? Is the extra damage on the plane worth it or is it so low i shouldn't even bother?
HeroesandGenerals,3731iw,MrKilla-munjaro,3,Mon May 25 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't really bother. If you get very lucky you could headshot someone out their cockpit (if they're facing you. It sounds crazy but it has happened to me!) but generally the rounds rifles fire are too small to damage planes at all. The one exception would be the PTRD, you can kill planes in a few shots with those but its an anti-tank rifle so that makes sense!   If the planes are annoying you then look for AA positions to shoot at them with. Other than that try and stay in doors or move close to buildings or natural features like holes and trees since they mask your movements to the pilots normally."

HeroesandGenerals,3731iw,MrKilla-munjaro,1 point,Tue May 26 13:09:07 2015 UTC,The newest map is quite urban. In the dev updates they mentioned that someone is working on a completely city grid map for city assaults but they weren't sure how to implement it because tanks and planes become less useful but hopefully it will come to be!

However, once it is unlocked you cannot purchase it in the store. It just isnt in the list at all. Switched to Recon to buy them and still not available in the store.

For example, I saw a US player using a Degtyarev in a battle against US and Germany, no Soviets. As far as I know, you can't buy other factions weapons for your soldier. Is something fishy going on or is there something I don't know?"
HeroesandGenerals,3731iw,Kronic187,3,Tue May 26 13:46:31 2015 UTC,You used to be able to buy Soviet weapons as the other factions before the Soviet faction was introduced. I think those who already had them when the Soviets were brought in got to keep them but I don't think they can mod them

Everything else will lose you money, especially at low ranks.   Secondly, your starter rifle is only good when you mod it, and you can only make money on a modded rifle at higher levels. The first thing you should buy is your starter SMG (MP34 for Germans, Grease Gun for Americans, and PPD40 for Soviets). It's not a great gun, but it's better than your starting rifle.   Once you have that, you have your basic loadout. Grind that character until you get your T2 SMG. Once you get there, we can talk about mods.  Finally, branch out. Once your money maker is making a lot of money, spend it on some new characters for the other branches. Ideally you should have one of everything, but more can be added as necessary.

HeroesandGenerals,372dp8,Neralm,3,Sun May 24 10:12:36 2015 UTC,The soviets are a new faction (couple of months old) and the allies & axis have been there for 2+ years.  That explains why there's less people that have unlocked the heavier tanks.
HeroesandGenerals,372dp8,Fagadaba,3,Sun May 24 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"The problem i see our SOV light tankers do, is depleate the AT within the first 5 minute of the match. They keep spawning the tier 1 or sometimes tier 2 light tanks, which btw the soviet light tanks are made out of paper, regular machiene guns can damage them, unlike the other faction's light tanks, and not letting us spawn the tier 3 light tank.  I mean i get it, you gatta level somehow, and we're playing staged matches, but if you keep doing something and dying, why keep doing it? Take a different route, memorize where the enemy tank killed you from, and flank...  ok enough rant  Here are some things you can do as a newbie with no AT gear:   Spot the tankers for your teammates, chances are someone has AT gear, and they wouldnt mind getting the tank destruction xp. Get a penzer crate on your jeep, and keep using it to level up and get the AT gear you so desperately need in this game."

You can flank with the Panzerfausts, get killed, re spawn, pick one up and run to the tank.   Equip grenades (regulars) and throw them into the points when they're being captured by the enemy, you can also blow random shit up with the panzerfausts and still unlock explosives.   I suggest reading this - http://hng.panzerfaustnews.com/the-anti-armortank-guide-strategies/  But yes, you can still do something even though you're a ""newbie"" to the game, trust me, we all started out where you are and I do it every time I purchase a new infantry soldier."

I think it's mostly games that have tanks in them. I haven't fully associated what the common denominators are for me when it's smooth vs choppy.

Turning off all the over-laid  UI and no music etc.  If Reto allowed us to turn off capping sounds or replace with ""hardcore alerts"" (Audio file is a radio message or field bugle) it would certainly be better.  Also, the heavy breathing audio for being out of stamina needs to be a little louder. This would annoy to many people as a default so perhaps this options as a slider option to adjust the volume would be better.  As for map changes....I'm sure they are doing the best they can to create cover without causing performance issues. I'm always up for a new map to explore though."

HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cha0sfox,1 point,Fri May 22 11:58:23 2015 UTC,then again OP has a gt 520 which is probably the source of his problems so at that point integrated graphics might do better.
HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cynical_Ostrich,2,Fri May 22 14:09:43 2015 UTC,Welp orry to tell yu but at the moment the game is really unoptomized for example I've seen a lot of steamers play and get maybe 30-40fps (maybe 50-60) on at least a gtx 970 or r9 280 (not comparable but you get the point) and this is while streamning and aiming however I have a gtx 750 ti and im lichy to get 30 fps in a full pop battle so for the moment we have to wait probably until it exits open beta and see what they do for optomization but for now we cant really do much.
HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Fri May 22 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"OK thanks for the response, I will probably wait until it has been optimised a bit more like you said and then play."
HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Fri May 22 14:25:17 2015 UTC,that would probably be a better option. or just upgrading your gpu should do it seeing as through this is a very gpu oriented game. btw what are your system specs (not counting the gpu)?
HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Fri May 22 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"OS - Windows 8.1  CPU - Intel® Core™ i5-4460S Processor (2.9 GHz, 3.4 GHz with TurboBoost, 6 MB cache)  RAM - 8 GB DDR3  GPU - NVIDIA GeForce GT 705 (I made a mistake in the original post)  Motherboard - Intel Z87  Monitors - 2 x HP ISP 23"" 60Hz"
HeroesandGenerals,36uw40,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Fri May 22 15:13:29 2015 UTC,ok... so it looks like you can upgrade your gpu and if youre on a budget maybe a gtx 750 ti (150$) and above (760 or 960) for about 200$ should improve ur performance drastically provided you have at least a 500w psu for the 760/960 or at least a 400-430w psu for the 750ti (for room to upgrade and stuff)

HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,MrKilla-munjaro,3,Fri May 22 09:22:52 2015 UTC,Your post makes no sense and in most parts it is just you ranting about stuff you cant fight againts with your skill set. longer answer might follow in few hours.
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Wildpoop,3,Fri May 22 10:11:25 2015 UTC,"Some of his points are valid, especially the one about medium tanks.  If you don't see a problem, you simply aren't looking."
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Inanimate_Legion,1 point,Fri May 22 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"No, I reckon it does make sense, I've thought about this stuff quite a lot. If something doesn't make sense please tell me what it is specifically and I'll try and make it clearer.  It's also not a skill issue because I'm not that bad a player, as far as I can tell.   I wasn't ranting I was explaining how I thought some of the game mechanics had changed and how they weren't all necessarily gelling with each other well!   But I'm happy to respond to specific points you thought were ranty or nonsensical."
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Silentway47,1 point,Fri May 22 11:41:28 2015 UTC,"1) I can't really comment here because I don't know what you are talking about. I play my tanker on staged battles and I never run out of spawns. Maybe you die too much.  2) I don't find this to be a problem. I find very few infantry actually using the bolt actions and most are not very good at it. At close ranges they are depending on a lot of luck to hit you if you are running around. When I play recon and I'm in a close engagement with an enemy with a  machine gun or SMG, its usually 50/50. I actually switch to my pistol in most cases because if you miss you are dead. My MG42 does a lot better job assaulting an area than a bolt action, likewise when defending.  3) The german medium tanks weren't really all that good in real life. the crews and tactics are what made them effective. I only play the light tanks but I have heard the German medium tanks need a buff. They were designed to support infantry and Tank Destroyers (aka assault guns) were designed to be assault tanks. If you want a tank for assault take the tank that was designed for that."
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Silentway47,1 point,Fri May 22 13:27:46 2015 UTC,1) well that's why I was interested in asking if people had similar experiences. Maybe I'm just having bad luck with team mates. No I usually die once or twice and just run out of tanks. I've been in games with like 8/9 tanks/planes deployed at the same time and if you only have around 20 tanks to go around that means you're only gonna get 2/3 at most!   2) It's true a lot of people aren't great with it but the need to switch to other weapons is the kind of thing that should be more emphasised I guess? Cause I do see people just using battle rifles a lot of the time in all situations and it is quite frustrating.   3) Again its about realism vs balancing. Given that we can't have tank crews and there isn't a whole lot of physics going into whether rounds penetrate or what they could hit to cause internal damage we are only interested in what the tanks can take and what they can dish out and I haven't been finding it particularly fair of late given how Russian tanks perform against German ones. I'm just not sure what is added by having the German tanks disadvantaged in the way that they currently are!   It's good to know this problem isn't so widespread though.
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Inanimate_Legion,2,Fri May 22 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"1) If that is the case then it seems you should be more conservative with your tank not only because you will die but because you will be wasting assets. One thing I have noticed about tankers is their inability to disengage. they get tunnel vision and just fire until they are dead. You can always withdraw from an engagement especially if you don't know where you are getting hit from.  2) Most people are usually only carrying 2 things at a time. So they don't have anything to switch to other than mines, grenades, shovel or pistol. I can't speak for the majority but I imagine most people are not bringing a pistol. Only my recon brings a pistol while my infantry bring grenades or rocket launchers. So you can't emphasize switching weapons if all they have is a rifle and a grenade.  3) Again I can't really comment on this. The only thing I can think of is make sure you know what tanks you are fighting against. Not all tanks are equal, look at the german light tanks, they are all outmatched by the Stuart except the Pz38. So if you aren't in a Pz38 find something else to shoot at or flank."
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Agreenarrow,2,Fri May 22 15:25:08 2015 UTC,they are all outmatched by the Stuart except the Pz38.   No light tank can stand up to a panzer 2 with a good gunner. :)
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Agreenarrow,1 point,Fri May 22 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"1) I agree most tanks do seem to overly engage. Again my issue isn't so much with gameplay, I think of all people played like that the issue might dissapear but you can't legislate for how people will play. What you can do is limit numbers on AT's slightly more than they are. Uncapping them like this just encourages the wrong kind of behaviour is what I worry. Very fair points though, people ought to be more conservative.   2) Good point, perhaps I'm being unfair in expecting that. Part of me does see the point in having it be a one hit kill, it makes it more useful but I still think its OP. I'm perfectly capable of killing most people with an unmodded BA at range, making it one hit just does feel overpowered to me. Maybe that's just my hang up though.   3) Light tanks are fine, you get outgunned by a Chaffee so you engage it from the flanks but for most things you can take a 3/4 shots head on before going down. In a medium german tank you'll survive two shots if you're very lucky! It's just hard to engage properly when you know that if you take one shot you will, most likely, not survive the second shot. Especially given that it takes three shots to kill the higher tier medium tanks on the Russian and American side. I appreciate the tank just isn't designed to fill that role, it's essentially just got a slightly bigger turret and some side skirting that isn't that useful but then why not give the Germans a better medium tank?"
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Wildpoop,1 point,Fri May 22 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"I was mad about the medium tank thing too until I found the reason why we are 2 shotted, its all about the armor thickness. The enemy tanks have much thicker armor on some disses, and therefore you need to know exactly where to aim."
HeroesandGenerals,36uxbi,Inanimate_Legion,1 point,Thu May 28 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"But even so, I seem to not two shot them on their tracks, perhaps turrets and backs are two shots to them but its really frustrating that two shots on the Panzer IV - anywhere - are, generally, enough to kill it! Do you have a method for where to shoot?"
HeroesandGenerals,36qdwj,TeleVue,5,Thu May 21 08:03:05 2015 UTC,Total repair costs was 12k. I was paid 9k so I lost money.   Every time I use my best guys/setup.

HeroesandGenerals,36qdwj,ThirdEye07,2,Thu May 21 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of a time where I was playing as Germans defending a Town from an American armored spearhead.   The troop difference started out at about 200 to 5000, we held out in the church for the entire time (I can't remember how long but I think it was nearing 90 minutes). We were whistling frantically whenever we saw enemies or tanks. Stealing enemy weaponry just to receive any sort of advantage we could possibly get.

The blue arrow tags fade in and out from time to time depending on where they are and their position.  I've seen people complain about the similarities in uniforms which can be confusing.
HeroesandGenerals,36rw6e,plaidpilgrim,1 point,Thu May 21 20:47:54 2015 UTC,You can buy a Russian uniform for your German soldier?  That would explain it...  Kinda not cool.
HeroesandGenerals,36oa0y,DLStark,3,Wed May 20 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"You also need to consider they get fielded less often and that Generals will use you only as cannon fodder in wars to stop the advancement of ARMIES. See that division of 2,000 infantry soldiers? I'm going to need your group of 64 paratroopers to stop their advancement... Thanks.  Whether it's a good or bad idea is up to you. I'd go what everyone says and that to keep your main guy as the money maker infantry and to level another soldier to whatever you want him to be because as soon as paratrooper lives are gone, you're going to get kicked!"
HeroesandGenerals,36oa0y,TeleVue,3,Wed May 20 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"+1, I second this motion.   Generally paras are low maintenance money wise so you really won't lose money swapping your primary to the branch BUT you will lose all the versatility over infantry as paras have the smallest load out in the game.   The biggest issue with making a para your primary is as soon as the unit is done you are as well. Staged or war. Better hope the battle doesn't run longer than your time in it, else no pay check.  The benefit of keeping your highest level soldier infantry is the simple fact they will always be in the battle last the majority of the time.. Therefore available for you to continue the fight. To claim a paycheck.   Roll another toon for a para, there is a reason everyone says keep your highest level infantry.   Edit - I should add the pay difference from a level 7 para to a new infantry is some one thousand credits per round.. Better to have that coin reading the inf side where your highest level is making that coin instead of giving it up because you weren't in battle long enough on the para side."
HeroesandGenerals,36oa0y,woohooguy,2,Wed May 20 23:50:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Do you have any input on the advantages/disadvantages of purchasing an Academy Trained Paratrooper?
HeroesandGenerals,36oa0y,woohooguy,2,Thu May 21 00:01:02 2015 UTC,"Plus is you get a instant paratrooper.   Negative is any Academy trained soldier you buy cannot change branches. It will be para for life or until you retire it as a General.   That said if you have some cash burning a hole in your pocket, genuinely enjoy playing the game, then buy Veteran.   90 days is the best deal at about 20 bucks with gold left over. The benefits are great with a 100 percent xp bonus so your new future para will level real fast plus 25 percent ribbon xp will unlock things much faster.. The additional cash will allow you to buy things as they unlock.   The 2nd badge slot is the icing on the cake."
HeroesandGenerals,36oa0y,woohooguy,1 point,Thu May 21 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm still very fuzzy on how the Generals control things...Hell, I thought Staged battles were like 'arcade' mode or some such nonsense that didn't affect anything."

HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,MrQuicksilver,1 point,Wed May 20 19:22:15 2015 UTC,Once you get recon the run up to OHK is a little irritating but after you get OHK it's pure fun. :)  Then comes the LONG run to recon level 12 and being invisible (no kill cam).  My American sniper is recon 12 and it's sooooo nice to shoot and know they have no clue where it came from.
HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,420blazeyoloswaggy,1 point,Wed May 20 19:33:01 2015 UTC,do you prefer playing as the american sniper or the german?
HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,420blazeyoloswaggy,1 point,Thu May 21 09:54:42 2015 UTC,"Well like I said I have several high level American guys (Sniper, Tanker, Para, etc.) and the Sniper specifically is a recon 12 (no kill cam) however I prefer the German sights on the rifle over the American and I LOVE the German recon vehicle.  The other thing is that the American teams, in my opinion, are filled with tons of kiddies who found this really fun F2P game but have no clue how to wipe their on butts nor how to play.  Think team killing at spawn.  The German team just seems to be more mature and has much better tactics.  Again just my opinion and don't get me wrong, there are some amazing American players."
HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,Silentway47,1 point,Thu May 21 13:08:21 2015 UTC,i only really play american but i might move to german because of the kiddies on the american side
HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,Silentway47,1 point,Thu May 21 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I don't have much of a desire for the recon vehicle. I tend to just snipe people out of them.   I heard it was good though, I wonder how it hold sup against tanks and AT stuff"
HeroesandGenerals,36ns5x,Silentway47,1 point,Wed May 20 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"Out of the 3 recon vehicles (American, German, Soviet) it's the king.  Against light armor it's also really good.  The best part about the recon vehicle is that you can look out of it from a 3rd person view so you see everything around you.  Makes it extremely difficult to sneak up on it.  As a matter of fact I love waiting for infantry to come up and try to plant mines.  I drive a short distance away and blast them.  I'll be honest, the vehicle is so good (90/12) that I almost consider it cheating and only use it when we are really down."
HeroesandGenerals,36nzd1,RealityAskew,1 point,Wed May 20 19:45:26 2015 UTC,You can't add tags by renaming the soldier in soldier management for the almost 8k credits?  Does Reto not allow odd characters? I ask as I know you can rename the soldier but never tried symbols.   Edit -  ah you mean globally as main account. I get it.
HeroesandGenerals,36nzd1,woohooguy,1 point,Wed May 20 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry yes you can rename the soldier but on the TAB screen your name cannot be changed.  Thus SSG_Black will always be SSG_Black.  However if I join a clan I would love to have something like [SOG] SSG_Black, whereas [SOG] is the clan tag."
HeroesandGenerals,36nzd1,woohooguy,1 point,Wed May 20 20:12:02 2015 UTC,It would be handy to have a field for tags that applies globally.
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,Mr_Killface,2,Wed May 20 11:41:23 2015 UTC,"Ignore the wait time, it is useless. Staged battles tick over faster than the war most days. Weekends seem to be busier for war games in my area.   If you want to speed it up, have a soldier in each faction and play staged battles."
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,hemansteve,1 point,Wed May 20 11:45:30 2015 UTC,The past week or so it takes me anywhere from 5-25 minutes to find a game with my US recon.
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,oxiclean9000,1 point,Wed May 20 12:28:02 2015 UTC,if it really bother syou and you have multiple characters from the same faction you can select all of them (from the same faction) and it'll search for games for all the characters. i do it all the time with my tanker and infantryman for germany and it shortens my queue times by about 10-20 sec. its not that much but still wort hit if your in a rush or grinding like me
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,Cynical_Ostrich,1 point,Wed May 20 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"If you aren't playing infantry, expect long wait times.   Try Staged Battles as there's plenty of games going on. If you want instant joins, go to War Battles and individually pick games yourself and not let the Match Maker take its time.   Just note, the more specialized your skill, the less you're fielded into the battle field. That includes tanks, planes, and recon."
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,TeleVue,1 point,Wed May 20 14:58:07 2015 UTC,Staged battles take about a minute for me despite a 15 second wait queue. I never queue for war battles because there aren't as many so I wait and go to the ones that let you enter combat immediately.
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,Silentway47,1 point,Wed May 20 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"The estimated wait time is actually the minimum estimated wait time, few builds ago it used to be the average wait time.  And what class you are queueing as matters; an infantry isnt going to wait as long as a tanker for example."
HeroesandGenerals,36m34z,Zackory,1 point,Thu May 21 21:37:31 2015 UTC,Started playing a few weeks ago and I'm tier five infantry. It seems no matter what play time I choose the wait times are ridiculous. It's averaging at 20 minutes. I gave up at nearly 40 minutes last time. I just got my brother into this game and I feel guilty. As I'm pretty much done with it because of the wait times and lack of joinable matches. Another game that joins a growing list of jump in on the rare occasion titles for me. For the rest of you. I hope you are having better wait times than I.
HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,boom_townTANK,8,Wed May 20 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"Always good to see new players in H&G, welcome to the war  This game is very harsh on newcomers as many people will tell you, but if you persist then it becomes a very fun coordinated team game. There will be good games and bad games but you will learn from each one and become a better soldier out of it.  The first tip I can offer you is to play skirmishes. Skirmishes are balanced games which are easy to grind out credits or weapons. They will also not affect the war in any way so people will rage less.   Second tip is to use cover whenever you can. There are a lot of snipers, tanks and aircraft that can kill you easily in the open. Use any rocks or trees to advance to the next position and capture that point!  Speaking of points, the name of this game is to capture the enemy control points. Too many times players just stay back and get kills, all the while forgetting that they are under the clock. As an infantryman, it is your job to capture the points or defend them with your life. The game will only end when the attackers capture the main control points (often represented as O1, O2 or O3), or the defenders hold off the attackers or capture their entry points (A1, B1 etc).  Flanking is very important as well. Running blindly to the next capture is just asking to be shot or bombed. Use hills or buildings to circle around and surprise the enemy, Who knows maybe you could snipe a tank driver and steal his tank, or acquire a sniper rifle to help your team advance.  Sound plays a very big role as well. Keeping an ear out can let you know if an enemy tank is coming around the corner, or if a sniper is shooting from behind a tree in front of you. You can also hear the bullets pinging around you if someone is shooting you. When you play the game for long enough you can even identify the weapons just by their sounds. This can help you judge what distance to engage them from.  Using your jeep as transport is really good. Too often many players just drive off solo and leave teammates behind, wasting resources and leaving valuable manpower behind. Don't forget the drive in cover to protect your passengers, but don't go to fast and spin out of control leaving you open and exposed. Another small tip with the jeeps is that the MG on the back can pierce light tank armor, so driving behind them and laying into them can work out well. The jeep can also serve as a very effective anti infantry turret. If you sneak behind lines, park it in a non obvious spot and get the gunner to mow down any infantry they see. If you get shot at then simply drive off and find another spot.  If you need any more help there is also a wiki, and faction guide on the sidebar. There are also a lot of youtube videos describing the different roles of the soldiers in game.  Hope you keep playing mate, and I hope these tips help"
HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,Cardinal363,3,Wed May 20 10:17:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, so much good info here.  OK, skirmish it is!  I'll try to put your great tips into action.  I think I am getting pretty good with the Jeep, I will probably get that Armored Personnel Carrier soon too.    So if I find a sniper rifle I can use it even if I am not certified for it?  I've stolen some enemy jeep...not sure if it was German or Soviet but it didn't have a gun mounted on it so I thought it kind of sucked really :P  I am getting a little better, it is a tough game, I'll keep trying and maybe see you on the Warfront in a month or two."
HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,Cardinal363,3,Wed May 20 11:15:57 2015 UTC,You can use any weapon that the enemy drops even if you aren't certified. You can also steal any vehicle if you shoot the driver out apart from planes.
HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,TangibleLight,3,Wed May 20 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"Actually you can steal planes of they're on the ground, but that only ever happens on the airfield map, and you're likely to die if you start unlocking it."

HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,TangibleLight,4,Wed May 20 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"Most of this sounds more like ""new player-itis"" than anything serious. You're more or less going to suck until you don't. I still sometimes go negative kd, and I've been playing for over a year.   If you like the M1, use the M1. If you want to, you can use the modified ammo to make it two hit kill. That might help a little.   You can play those large maps in staged as well, without using up a persons AT. Just click on ""town"", ""airfield"", ""forward airfield"", or ""mountain town"" (avoid factory like the plague).   Also, if you'd like, you could come out to try hanging with the Allied Airborne Army. We're a group of vets who offer training classes to new players like yourself.

HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,hemansteve,3,Wed May 20 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't know the big maps were for Skirmish too.  That's great.  I am currently behind a firewall but will check your site out when I get home, I appreciate it!"
HeroesandGenerals,36l9fb,Cozichacozee,3,Wed May 20 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think you're confusing Skirmish, Staged, and War.   Staged and War are two separate ""modes"" in the game.  War battles contribute to the war on the ""Generals"" tab in the menu. Your deaths and losses cost other players resources and was funds. It's recommended that people don't play this mode unless they know what you're doing. You're completely locked out of this mode until at least one soldier reaches level 3.  Staged battles are initially balanced, with equal resources allocated to each team. Your deaths have no penalty outside of the current match, and there aren't any consequences for victory or defeat (other than XP for your team).  Both of these modes (once you're above level 3) have two types of matches: skirmishes and battles. Skirmishes are usually shorter, and only take place on the maps Forest Skirmish, Hill Skirmish, and Village Skirmish. Pilots can not join these, but all other classes can. Full battles can happen on any of the other maps.  Before you reach level three, you are locked to infantry-only staged battles. These happen in both skirmishes and full battles. Once any one of your soldiers reaches level three, the game assumes you are competent and allows you to join any match."

Remember that you've got a second seat with a machine gun for footies - Best part, and you can't overlook the advantage to this, is the mg has full 360 degree traverse. I can't overstate how beneficial this is!  So you can excel at a number of play styles with a Hetzer:   1) Run and gun against enemy armor w/ a friend in your MG (works better than you might think).  2) Sit back by yourself and snipe enemy armor. Check your 6 via the mg seat every now and then.  3) If no enemy armor or mechanized infy, park on a cap point and shred those squishies w/ your MG."

HeroesandGenerals,36m7h4,THISAINTMYJOB,2,Wed May 20 12:23:54 2015 UTC,"Use the M1 Garand/ G43. They're good guns that can kill from short to medium ranges. Mod them to a two hit kill for better effectiveness. You could also not shoot your gun and throw grenades like a mad man if you want repair costs low. Adding mods to a gun increases it's repair bill.   The respawn button zooming out is a glitch. It happens. Just click it again.   Credit earning slow at first but quickly rises the higher rank you go. I think it's like 500 gp bonus for every level you advance.   The game asking for gold is the only way H&G survives. If the game were seriously greedy, they'd have more pay to win options other than giving vets more benefits other than an extra badge and faster leveling. Everything in the game can be unlocked by grinding a little. It might take a while but it's all within reach. Seriously, I haven't spent a dollar on this game.   Hit boxes are small and are ping dependent. There are bullet travel times and archs that take time to understand. If you're using an SMG, they hit low damage values so it takes longer to kill people..."
HeroesandGenerals,36m7h4,TeleVue,1 point,Wed May 20 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah this all this. Also on the spawning there is no point in trying to do it super fast. Unless you are changing spawns the count down starts regardless of whether or not you have clicked to spawn. What i mean by this is if it is going to take you 10sec to spawn you can just wait 10 sec then click on it and auto spawn  EDIT: Also you can make decent money with a modded bolt action, Esp if you go for the weaker OHK (the one that only kills non heavy sets) Less firing = less repair. I can't imaging what you are doing to have half the cost of a weapon as repair. I have spent matches firing constantly to get ribbon exp up for the SA rifle and even then the cost was next to nothing  (unless i was using special ammo). Are you just firing the bazooka like crazy or something?"

As long as you don't miss, the repair costs are low. Also as a tip, pick up another gun every chance you can get so that you aren't using your own gun. It'll save you money and also gain xp in other guns."

HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Maitrify,7,Tue May 19 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"People who bitch about how much stuff costs and that the refill costs are too high don't play the game properly.  If you play the objectives you will always profit, even if you lose the match...  BTW the Thompson is 156,000 - so I guess you better lube up if you ever decide to play Allied."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,plaidpilgrim,3,Tue May 19 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the upkeep is not a big deal. Unmod your gun, and stop spamming nades. You'll have that credit in no time. If you nadespamm every cap point and you have fully modded weapon that you just spray without aiming, you will have low income."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Wildpoop,0,Tue May 19 13:59:46 2015 UTC,"and you have fully modded weapon that you just spray without aiming, you will have low income.   Unless its an MG42. :)"
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Inanimate_Legion,8,Fri May 22 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"You're buying one of the greatest guns in the game. You'd be damned  if you think you'll get that for any less than a hundred rounds. Will veterans get it a little sooner? Unless they're absolute morons, yes. But you'll still have  the same options.   I tallied it up one time- I have over $200 worth of goods in the game, between ATs and guns and upgrades and soldiers, and you know how much I've spent? $0. Absolutely nothing."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,mickdude2,6,Tue May 19 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of well thought out critique that gets things done. Play the game, enjoy the game, bitch less."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,H3MP79,2,Tue May 19 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"You say that now but your pay will increase soon as you rank up. The MP40 is worth it and buying all the guns and up grades to get it is part of the process. Trust me, once you have all the toys with their bells and whistles you get bored and start a new character for the challenge."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,hemansteve,1 point,Tue May 19 15:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what someone mentioned to me elsewhere. I forgot about that although it sounds like longer matches are actually a bad thing, asa short skirmish runs 10-15m and gives 4-5k whereas an Assault gives 7k on a wonderful game that lasted an hour."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TangibleLight,2,Tue May 19 22:10:58 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice for getting money.   Take your highest ranking infantry soldier, and inform him that he will never change class. Level him up as much as possible so he gets the most pay, and make sure you know how to be effective with his loadout without spending too much money (ie basic rifleman or unmodded SMG).  I can get around 7k profit from a good match with my breadmaker soldier. Most of the time it's 4 or 5k profit, though. Full battles, particularly Forward Airfield, generally cost more simply because they last longer and you'll be using more ammo.   My loadout is an MP40 with the hair trigger, frag grenades, and binoculars (not really sure why I've got those; nobody listens when I try to do commands).   Also, if you see someone else's weapon on the ground - even if it's the same model weapon you've got - use it! The game doesn't charge you for ammo spent on other peoples' weapons, even (AFAIK) if you use an infantry resupply to get more ammo. Plus, if you're using an unmodded weapon and you grab the same model: at best it will be modded to be better, at worst it will save you some money for the same experience.  Edit: To clarify: I'm not 100% sure about free ammo for others' weapons, but it seems to be true. If someone can definitively say whether that's true or not, please do so."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TangibleLight,3,Tue May 19 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I concur that I enjoy the game which is honestly the reason I'm bitching. If I were just out-right done with it, you'd hear nothing from me. I really, really want to like the game but ... I'm seeing that eventually it feel like a grind, and a game that is more grind than fun, is not a game that serves it's purpose, right?"
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Neralm,3,Tue May 19 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"If you have fun while you're grinding then I'd say it has. Try not to take it too seriously. But don't dick around and blow friendlies up, either.   I have a friend who I often play with on voice calls, and he gets ... let's just say ""immersed"" in the game. He flips out when teammates are wasting time or are too far away from the point, etc.   Don't be like that. It's just a game, and it's intended to be fun. Often times tanks, planes, one hit rifles, and mostly everything else are frustrating, but it's still a game. I also find I do better if I don't get emotionally invested in a match. Staying calm through it and just focusing on these as obstacles to overcome lets me be much more effective. Nothing is more satisfying than blowing up a spawn-camping tank, but you can't do that if all you do is get upset when you run out into the open for the fifth time.   Also, I'm not saying you do behave like this; he's a bit of an extreme example. I just think that the mentality, usually to a lesser extent, is still there in a lot of the community, but I don't think it is helpful to anyone.  Edit: grammar"
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,jerryFrankson,4,Tue May 19 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"I agree 100 % the grinding and lack of progress is just making me play less and less , im afraid i will just quit for good cos of this ."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,pipezas,3,Tue May 19 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"I gradually stopped playing, largely because of this. It wasn't about making a statement, it's about personal objectives. When you play for free, you hit a certain point at which all of your objectives (unlock this, buy that) are so far away that you don't really see yourself making progress. That's more a question of taking forever to unlock certain ribbons than it is about making enough silver, but that's the point at which you get really bored.  So if there's any devs reading this (probably not, but who knows?): yes, your methods of wanting to make more and more money are driving people away, not just people who want to make a statement."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,b1ghead3d,3,Tue May 19 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't anderstand people bitching about grinding. What is grinding in this game? I'll tell you what it is. It's playing the game! The game is not about getting new weapons faster nor is it about upgrades, its a WW era MMOFPS, god damn it. The battles are the main part here, if you want to be better, have better, more powerful, weapons - be better at the game, cap more points, kill more soldiers etc. but if you're not good at it, play with the stuff you have, till you will get good and can get that much money to upkeep your upgraded weapons and whatnot."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Bumpidump,2,Tue May 19 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"It's considerably one of the best weapons at your disposal, so yeah it's not handed to you. The grind isn't that bad at all. Unmod your weapons, don't spam grenades, and don't use AT besides fausts you pick up. Sorry you have to grind from being a low ranking soldier to something worthwhile. Maybe go play COD."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,lordaddament,2,Tue May 19 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"This is why I don't want to play this despite wanting to like it. That and this concept here that I posted to the fourms:  I wholeheartedly concur with this post (the OP's).  Think of it this way:  A person who pays to play, has less worries with regard to currency, correct? They can, and will, replenish their weapons without much care to what they do in the matches. This gives them rather extensive freedom. See an enemy tank? Use a second solider with schreck rounds to kill it. See a sniper? Get a tank and go after them.  They have the freedom to counter what the enemy is using with their own weapons and equipment because they're not concerned whether or not they will make a profit at the end.  A person who does not pay to play a 'free game' on the other hand.  Oh, a tank? You take care of it, I can't afford the rounds. (You're gonna have a bad time.) Oh, that sniper that is spawn camping us (which seems to be ENCOURAGED in this game with the lack of spawn protection...) in the forest behind us? Can't go after him, no currency to replenish my tank or car.  etc and etc.  Yes, by definition, this game is 'Pay to Advance' but because of the high, inflated numbers, it turns into a weird species of pay to win because if you pay to play, you have a much better ability to win. Sure I can get those same weapons, same tanks. But it will take me 100x as long, and it will be JUST as hard to MAINTAIN those new shiny toys because I don't get massive bonues plus the PRICES ARE SO &%$#ING HIGH."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,jerryFrankson,2,Tue May 19 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"You are making it out to be extreme :/ It really isn't that bad. I don't switch between my soldiers and I don't relog to switch weapons midgame. Just because you see a sniper doesn't mean you pick a tanksoldier. You just need to adapt to them being there. just driving a jeep makes it 35927489329 harder to get hit that it will happen VERY rarely. And I often play my smg/bolt-action rifle combo so can't be killing tanks at all with that.  My advice for a good all-around GOOD cheap build is GV43(most underrated weapon imo),grenades and mines. This way you can compete with everything. Worst scenarios would be VERY far distances(which you avoid) and close up in houses vs smgs, in which you just have to outplay them and steal their smg if you want to stay in the house.  You also get more coins per game the higher level you are.  Edit: I agree though that being a veteranmember does give you certain freedom. More coins, better ribbonprogression, can use 2 badges etc. But it isn't as bad as you make it out to be."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,iceing11,1 point,Tue May 19 14:43:34 2015 UTC,Man I can grind 127k coins in like 3 days of playing for maybe 3-4 hours a day
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TangibleLight,1 point,Tue May 19 15:53:59 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can't relog midgame anymore.
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,william1134,0,Tue May 19 15:54:37 2015 UTC,Is 3 second invisibility and invincibility not enough spawn protection for you?
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TeleVue,2,Tue May 19 15:17:39 2015 UTC,I just wish it didn't drain stamina while invisible.
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,MerryGoWrong,2,Tue May 19 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"Considering what the person below says (it drains stamina) plus most snipers start out in the woods ... yeah. It only gives you a limited spawn area to start in and allows you to be spawn camped like mad, specially with tanks."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TeleVue,1 point,Tue May 19 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"The game is imo overly grindy, but recently I bought the tommy gun, but honestly it didn't take that long to earn enough money for it."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,MerryGoWrong,1 point,Tue May 19 13:42:42 2015 UTC,"Oh em gee. 127k for a gun you only have to buy once and is relatively cheap to repair. Just think of all the other thousands of guys who've grinding 20-30 15minute skirmish matches to unlock the MP-40/Thompson. Consider also your mods on the MP34 transfer over to the next gun.   Everything costs silver. Every single repair and every single gun. It's a grind fest that's true but it's easy as fuck to grind. Maybe if you'd stop spamming grenades and shooting your MP34 like it's an MG42 would you have +4K profit per round. He'll, if you'd switch back to the G43 which is far more superior than the MP34, you'd have a higher profit margin.   This isn't EA's Battle Field where you have options to get into a tank a plane just to kill one guy. This is Heroes and Generals where you're basically cannon fodder until you can dig yourself out the grave you've logged into."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Inanimate_Legion,1 point,Tue May 19 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"Ha, wait until you get to the even higher tier stuff. Different faction, but the Soviet PTRD-1941 costs about 250,000 to unlock. Not sure about the German equipment but they probably have some equivalently priced stuff. The MG-42 is probably in that zone, but I don't know for sure."
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,TeleVue,1 point,Tue May 19 18:07:08 2015 UTC,MG42 was 155k. Well worth it in my opinion. The FG42 (Paratrooper exclusive) was I hear like 300k. It's a rebranded BAR.
HeroesandGenerals,36hmuq,Lameleo,1 point,Tue May 19 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the M-1919 MG on the US side was the same cost, about 155k. The PTRD is not worth 250k from a practical standpoint, but it's a lot of fun regardless."

HeroesandGenerals,36jq5e,woohooguy,1 point,Wed May 20 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"Ribbon progression has changed, you have what you earned so far it would seem as it probably has become tedious to calculate what you had to what is in place.   You can only deploy units in the war once you reach officer status, level 12.  Weapon modification overhaul was the most recent change, all previous weapon mods were refunded. Ribbon progression dictates what you can mod and when."
HeroesandGenerals,36jq5e,Silentway47,1 point,Wed May 20 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"I started playing again not too long ago after a 2.5 yr absense. Panzerfaust isnt purchacable so you have to buy a schrek or a bazooka.  I didnt have to rebuy my weapons but I did have to buy all the upgrades again but I was refunded for lal the upgrades.   For example I had a scoped K98k for my recon and he still had it when I logged in. Funny thing is was hes only rank 3 but now you have to be rank 9 so, no grinding for me :)"
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,RetainRadiation,4,Tue May 19 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"I think RO2 is a much better game, albeit harder.  You actually need to work as a team to win the game.  As for hyper realism, not so much, there's different game modes that can change the damage models so it's not OSK.  I highly recommend it."
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,McArctic,2,Tue May 19 18:01:50 2015 UTC,So is there much less people who think they can win it all because everyone is killed with a bullet to the chest?
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,McArctic,3,Tue May 19 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  There's VOIP so teams are generally very vocal and will try to coordinate.  There's much less waste in tickets as you can't just keep throwing yourself into the fight trying to be a hero.  You'll just bleed tickets and hinder the team.  It can be frustrating at first if you're not very good, but that's just the nature of the game."
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,henx125,2,Tue May 19 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"I found this super frustrating at first, because I couldn't aim. But no doubt the initial games will be hell."
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,henx125,3,Tue May 19 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"RO is a lot of fun. The way they handle tanks is much cooler too. I'd say that the ultimately RO is just a lot harder by comparison - at least in the 'hardcore' modes where you have to be able to tell if someone is an enemy or friendly based on their silhouette and the way they run and that sort of thing. I find that game more immersive and satisfying to get kills in, but for some reason I still find myself playing H&G a lot. I think the main reason for this for me at least is that, as stupid as it is, I like having the ""carrot on a stick"" goals of leveling up and unlocking new stuff to play with. RO has unlockables and levels, but they don't mean the same thing to me.   Overall I'd say that on paper RO is the better game but it does cost money and it's not perfect. I've seen it do free weekends a few times before so maybe wait until a sale or until you can try it out?  Edit: Also, if you are looking for a good team focused FPS, you might want to try out Project Reality that runs off of Battlefieild 2's engine. It might not be WW2, but it's an amazing mod, and they are going to release it as a free standalone game soon"
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,NotPhlyDaily,2,Tue May 19 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"I will look into that... sounds interesting. And like I've said before, it's not like I'm going to stop playing H&G. I just found another game to supplement my experience.  I love H&G, so there is no reason for me to stop. I have a lot of stuff in this game.  But I want to try out that hyper realism and the different game style, as well as the pacific theater."
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,NotPhlyDaily,1 point,Tue May 19 21:18:47 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with having a plethora of different games to play.

HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,TeleVue,2,Tue May 19 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like if I want to be immersed I go RS, if I just wanna shoot up some guys I go H&G. I'm cool with that. It's not like I'm gonna stop playing one altogether unless I really come to hate it, which I don't foresee."
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,henx125,1 point,Tue May 19 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no, the point i wanted to make is basically the same you made in your original post. Conclusion RO and RS= very realistic (for example= 1 shot kill by a m1 garand, mosin nagant, kar 98k,....) H§G: fun but not so realistic (atleast not so much realism in the weapons) + H§G has many tanks but RO only has one tank on both sides and not on all maps"
HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,ourmartyr1,2,Tue May 19 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"I have played RO2 for quite some time and to me it is a far superior experience over H&G. I have very rarely experienced a team work together in H&G, it mostly feels like everyone is out doing their own thing and not really caring about whether you win or lose. In most RO2 servers there is actual teamwork and you don't really play to get kills, but rather to help the team and your squad.  Although they are 2 very different games, I can't help but feel that H&G is for when you don't really wanna think about too much and just kill some guys, RO2 is for when you really want a challenge and immerse yourself. It is a lot harder too, and can be very frustrating at first, but it becomes very enjoyable once you get to know the maps and the game in general. I can only recommend trying it out.  Edit: It doesn't hurt either that there is no grinding in RO2."

HeroesandGenerals,36iaa6,AltisTeen,1 point,Tue May 19 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"Red Orchestra 2/RS was fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it for a while. I actually played it before I found Heroes and Generals but I got bored of it. The hyper realism one shot kill everything eventually got boring. The first person who shoots and contacts wins. No questions asked. While that's fun and immersive, it's too realistic. It just felt like a sniper fest. H&G is a grade below that where it takes a few unrealistic bullets to take someone down.   They're both completely different games tailored to two different audiences. While I still have Red Orchestra on my computer, I only ever play it when H&G is down."

HeroesandGenerals,36j21i,Lappenforce,2,Tue May 19 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"As a recon officer you can only buy and deploy recon units in the war. The same applies to the other branches, a infantry officer can only deploy Infantry units, etc.   You have to retire/buy a General to have the ability to deploy any branch of the military into war.   In the command HQ you will see the ability to purchase a unit, the units current status, the units experience, and importantly the number of command points (white dots) you have.   In the HQ is where you make your units deployable in war and where you upgrade them when they reach enough experience.   Keep in mind your command points, as you upgrade units they will require more command points.  Dont buy more than one unit at first as you won't have enough command points to deploy them when they upgrade.   The first upgrade happens pretty fast, the second takes much longer.   On the map screen you actually spend the warfunds to actually deploy your unit and pick a major city to deploy from.   To get around the map click and hold your unit box and drag onto the map. A arrow will form and you select where you want to go.   Where your unit is players in the FPS side can spawn into the battle with your resources.  If your recon unit is used up the FPS players run out of spawns and see the unit defeated message.   When your resources are used it needs to be reinforced. You will be shown what your unit needs and the cost. You pay, sit in the resource queue if there is a wait, then your reinforcements are deployed from the nearest major city.   You cannot reinforce a unit in battle (flashing) and you cannot move a unit that needs resupply. If you have some resources left over from battle and another forms in the same point then your resources will be made available until the battle is done or your unit runs out.   When you completely run out of resources the unit will un-deploy and you need to redeploy from a major city.    As a General you can join your own units in the fight but it's really about the strategy. A recon unit can be a very effective block and tie up thousands of enemy units for hours to days if no recon players spawn in the battle. Para blocks work the same way.   Help your fellow Generals, get in on the chat for your faction and join the strategy.   As a commander your unit will earn you character XP and warfunds, unfortunately there is no way to easily see aside from writing down your numbers and doing the math after the battles.   If you have a decent phone or even better a tablet, Heroes and Generals mobile command is a great app that will allow you to deploy, manage, and move your units when on the go with full faction chat included."

I have mixed feelings on the second part of your statement. Although it would make sense that you can't trip friendly mines, as you would be careful, I can see it leading to huge balancing issues.   Imagine - filling every doorway with mines. Every room with mines, and the enemy team that placed them can hop, skip, and jump through without a worry in the world. A squad with the mind to do it could shut down a control point for a whole game.  I would like to see the Bouncing Betty's get a tripwire feature like they're actually made for. Germans would lay a dozen or so and wire them all together. One string gets pulled, they all go up. One Betty could realistically take out 12 men moving in formation. A field wired together would be made an impasse. Recons would have a job to do other than spotting and sniping - disarming and unwiring Betty's.  Edit: Typo~"
HeroesandGenerals,36gh1r,Beardalelist,1 point,Tue May 19 05:56:48 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Perhaps if you were required to slow-walk (alt-w) over friendly ap-mines to not set them off?   Bouncing Betty's why not.  I know hand grenades detonating near s-mines set them off. Also I believe so, but haven't confirmed, that your own s-mines if placed too closely together set each other off. So you could maybe make a domino string of mines, emulating the Betty' s. Unsure however if secondary s-mine do damage or is just destroyed.  Could use some testing in a staged match"
HeroesandGenerals,36gh1r,Banyamulenge,1 point,Tue May 19 06:13:07 2015 UTC,"That I'd be down with. The slow-walk doesn't get enough use, and it would be enough to turn the tides.  I've seen folk do that. I think it's pretty clever. I also get a kick out of people hanging back and shooting them to force them to blow.  I have 600k in reserve. Might try that out."
HeroesandGenerals,36fxi6,mosler,3,Tue May 19 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"Id like to find a well organized group to play with. Something with a chain of command, where squads actually work together following, the orders of a squad leader, toward the goal. have level 9 infantry currently trained para, also have tanker and pilot.   I have just the place for you! We're dedicated, organized, and-   ahh... and I only play germany.   Oh. I see. Carry on."
