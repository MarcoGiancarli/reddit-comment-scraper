Gunsforsale,3dqr16,PADLOCK626,2,Sat Jul 18 15:25:18 2015 UTC,Gun shops seem to usually offer about 40% of the value of a gun as they have overhead and need a profit from it.  You'll get more in a private sale.  I'd ask 425-450 and take 400 if it was a friend wanting it but I'm lousy at haggling and sales.  This is the de cocker model?
Gunsforsale,3dqr16,GarthVolbeck,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:54 2015 UTC,I asked the shop what I could get in trade and he said $200; therefore I think I will see what i can get privately first. I completely understand him trying to make a profit.   It is not the decocker model. It has a standard thumb safety.
Gunsforsale,3dqr16,GarthVolbeck,2,Sat Jul 18 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"It's funny.  I love my Rami, it is my favorite gun I've ever owned.  I'm kind of weirdly insulted you are selling yours.    So THIS is how it feels to be a fanboy?  Huh.  ;)"
Gunsforsale,3dqr16,GarthVolbeck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:01:53 2015 UTC,I honestly just need to change the rear sight. The target sight is sharp as shit and it catches on my shirts and my arm.

Gunsforsale,3dop0c,vlad640,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"Mid to low $300's, maybe a little more if it's in really good condition. Probably maximum $400. The issue is more that there isn't a ton of demand so you could ask that but you might not find a buyer. I'd keep it, those old S&W's are great and the buyer is going to come out better than the seller in the transaction since they shoot better than they're worth."
Gunsforsale,3dop0c,rem87062597,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:18:36 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. I found one for $300, it only comes with one mag and a box of target ammo, and it has some wear on the finish but it sounds like a good deal.

Gunsforsale,3dagbm,TiePilot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be sure to check the back when I get home then.  And no, there are not upgrades for the barrel although If I had decided to keep the Tec 9 I would have gotten the cool looking barrel thingy."

Gunsforsale,3d9te7,badgerd,2,Tue Jul 14 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"The rifles alone are under $200, add $60 for the ammo and you're really at the max.  Not sure what the scope is worth, but it'll be a hard sell with the ""bolt"" and the stock is mucked at least a little too, so that'd need fixed.  I'd say asking $300 might be high but a reasonable starting point.  I figure a sale would end up in the $250-275 mark on the top end.  The brass you'd be better of selling in /r/BrassSwap"

Either way, midway has them for $159.99, my local shop has them for $169.99, and that range seems to be the going rate where I've looked. You can't really count old ones when I said new production and that's the price on new production ones."
Gunsforsale,3d9te7,GiornaGuirne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:16:30 2015 UTC,"Midway and your LGS are overpriced. It shouldn't be considered the market value.   Vintage glass can still be good glass, plus it adds to the overall look of an old rifle. Good condition K4's can be in the $60 range.  Seems like you overestimated the whole package. You've been trying to put out fires whenever someone tells you so."
Gunsforsale,3d9te7,GiornaGuirne,2,Wed Jul 15 10:51:23 2015 UTC,"Ohh yeah, for sure I overestimated the value. But that's why I put it here. I had no idea the bolt hurt as much as it does. And that ""gunsmithing"" job cost me $250. So yeah, obviously I want to get as much back as possible.   I actually really wanted a vintage K4, but I'm scared to death to purchase something like that without verifying it works. The responses I got from eBay sellers were less than confidence inspiring. And I think the bolt demonstrates my luck so far with this lol."

I was at a range in Louisiana and this guy was pumping out S&B Match King rounds from an Accuracy International AXMC and he was leaving the brass on the ground. Being a reloader and having friends that load for .338 LM, I asked him if I could take the brass and was surprised that he was more than happy to give it away. Some people just have money I guess."

Gunsforsale,3cu6gg,cmackmason,4,Fri Jul 10 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"May I ask why you are selling this in favor of a shadow. I own a shadow and I was looking at TS guns, so I am curious."
Gunsforsale,3cu6gg,CMFETCU,2,Sat Jul 11 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"I originally wanted the shadow but could not find one in stock anywhere.  I bought this instead but literally one week later I found a Shadow at my LGS and picked it up.  I have since been shooting the shadow regularly while this one has been sitting in the safe.    I really prefer the Shadow's size over this one.  While still extremely comfortable to shoot, it is a big gun.  Also I am not a huge fan of the Tactical Sport's sights - if I were to keep it, I would have to replace them.  I figure since both the Shadow and the Tactical Sport fill the same roll for me (range gun), I only need one of them and I prefer the Shadow over the Tactical Sport."
Gunsforsale,3cu6gg,gadela08,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:42:59 2015 UTC,"having shot both, i would say it depends on the size of your hands.  i enjoy a big heavy gun so i like the TS better."

Gunsforsale,3cuunx,M107_Lust,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:57:04 2015 UTC,That'll drive the cost up too and put it out of my price range. And I did see one on VA gun trader. I'll probably go with that one to save me time and money.

Gunsforsale,3cv69f,TSquared83,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:48 2015 UTC,No they work in any Glock 22/31 but they Gen 4 spring is too strong so its recommended that you get a 9mm spring for a gen 4. Since I'm only selling to switch to a threaded barrel I need to keep the spring.
Gunsforsale,3crotd,druskhusk,12,Fri Jul 10 05:57:21 2015 UTC,Look for a used M&P Shield online or around your area. They're not expensive and those who carry one swear by them.
Gunsforsale,3crotd,JDP90,5,Fri Jul 10 06:07:53 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, get a new M&P Shield for $340 + shipping and handling: http://anthony-industries.com/anthony-industries-firearm-warehouse/pistols/smith-and-wesson-m-p9-shield-9mm-detail"
Gunsforsale,3crotd,jhuang29,3,Fri Jul 10 07:06:14 2015 UTC,I approve of this suggestion.
Gunsforsale,3crotd,SmithWessonMP,14,Fri Jul 10 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"Your price range is pretty limiting. Are you sure you can't save up more? You're pretty much stuck to pocket pistols. I am constantly updating this list with whatever I can think of.     The Diamondback DB9 got a five star review on Truth About Guns, and I trust them: http://vizardsgunsandammo.com/diamondback-db9-micro-compact-dao-9mm-3-6-1-poly-grip-frame-black/    The Ruger LC9 is perhaps the most popular pocket pistol: http://www.cdnnsports.com/lc9-9mm-blue-dao-7rd-rug.html#.VZ9xudm9LCR    I would recommend a Tokarev or a Makarov if you're looking for a <$300 handgun, but they are not 9mm Luger (Edit: the Makarov is in 9mm Makarov). However, the Norinco 213 is a Tokarev that comes in 9mm: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=493409753    The Canik TP9SA is gun that has been well-received by reviewers but has not gotten very popular. Thus, you get a gun that's about $100 less than it should be. http://www.cncwarrior.com/Canik-TP9-SA-p/27041.htm    The Beretta Nano is purposely-designed to have no protrusions, perfect for discrete carry in even light clothes. http://www.hyattgunstore.com/beretta-nano-9mm-pistol-used-in-excellent-condition.html    Taurus is an underrated gun manufacturer. Its Taurus 24/7 G2 won the NRA Golden Bullseye Award. http://www.centerfireguns.com/taurus-24-7-9m-g2-3-5-bl-1247091g2c17.html    Remember: you can find most of these used for cheaper. Even better, find a local dealer on armslist.com and save on shipping. Use gunwatcher.com or gunbroker.com to find the cheapest listings. And always try to handle a physical copy of your gun before buying it."

Gunsforsale,3crotd,gunmedic,2,Fri Jul 10 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"A new SCCY is right in that price range.    And I see people recommending old surplus pistols.  Let me give my perspective on that as a gunsmith.  Avoid anything you can't get reliable spare parts for.  Something as simple as a broken extractor or firing pin and you have a paperweight.  And it's no good if you can't get spare magazines also.  There are good surplus guns available, but check availability of parts before you commit."
Gunsforsale,3crotd,maswell,3,Fri Jul 10 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"Also, Old surplus pistols like the P64 do not have firing pin blocks and other now-common safety features.  More than one person has accidently shot themselves with a P64 because the hammer gets caught or it gets dropped on the hammer.  I carry a p64 (you can get them for about 270 now) every now and then, but you have to carry it on safe to block the firing pin.  If you buy surplus to carry, educate yourself on them because of the spare parts like gunmedic said, the reliability, ammo sensitivity, and because of safety more than anything else."
Gunsforsale,3crotd,gunmedic,2,Fri Jul 10 13:41:14 2015 UTC,Also consider that 9mm para ammo engineered for peak performance is commonly available from a dozen companies.  9mm Mak ammo is not given the same treatment by ammo companies.  Much less something like 7.62x25

Gunsforsale,3crotd,nexquietus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"I actually like it. It's a little snappy, but manageable. When doing drills,  I'm as accurate as I could want.   I have bigish hands too and I think that's why I like the double stack p11 better than the pf9, though I think concealability wise, the pf9 is a touch smaller and lighter."
Gunsforsale,3crotd,wilfoy,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:52 2015 UTC,PSA has the Taurus PT-111 G2 9mm for $200  Don't let the Taurus haters fool you.

It was listed in /gundeals on here. A used in good shape I would try around $320-$350. I would just buy a new one for $400  and pick out a holster you like for not much more.  You could also have him take it to a store or gun shop and see what they will give him for it and give him $20 over that if he's looking to get rid of it for another firearm.

Get two pairs and you'll be good forever.) You will always be able to resole them and they'll look amazing. They will take a while to break in but once they do, you'll be a fashionable morherfucker and those boots are tough.   Also, Nordstrom will price match.

Gunsforsale,3bp3po,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"Endowment effect:       In behavioral economics, the endowment effect (also known as divestiture aversion) is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.  This is illustrated by the observation that people will tend to pay more to retain something they own than to obtain something owned by someone else—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago.  The endowment effect can be equated to the behavioural model Willingness to Accept or Pay (WTAP), a formula sometimes used to find out how much a consumer or person is willing to put up with or lose for different outcomes.

If they don't want some of the accessories, I'll list those separately.   But basically I need about 1200 bucks, so parting it out isn't really an option for me at the moment."

Gunsforsale,3b0ilw,Openthegate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"The winchester is a rifle, not a shotgun. Its likely a .30-30 but plenty of other calibers were made. That one can be worth anywhere from $350-2000 depending on its age and condition etc. If you posted pics of the actual guns in good lighting conditions that,would help. Also google 'winchester serial numbers"" the first link should be a list of models and their date ranges.  On the bottom of the rifle in front of the lever there will be the serial number.  Scroll down online until you see model 1894 and see when the rifle was made. If it was made before 1964 it will be more valuable if not its worth around  $500 tops.   Hope this helps."

Gunsforsale,3afcop,ruletwo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"My dad got it for home/personal defense and never fired it himself before he died. I gave it a try, just for shits and giggles, but I didn't like the feel of it. I have my own gun collection to deal with, plus 20 of his now.  The Glock chewed through 75-ish rounds of cheap-ass blazer with no problems. It's surprisingly accurate for how small it is, too. Recoil is a little more than a full-size 1911, but still manageable. If you have big gorilla sausage hands (like me), the grip extension and deeper mag are a life saver. It squares up the dimensions and makes it feel more balanced. This is the Gen 3 with the slimmer slide from the G36. That makes it easier to conceal and a little lighter. It wasn't designed to be a pleasure shooter, of course."

Personally, I wouldn't invest in one because the cartridge just isn't common enough or cheap enough to make it worth it to shoot, especially when, ballistically speaking, it is not that great compared to other ww rifles. But that's just me. If you dig it, try to get them to come way down, I can't speak on the value of the scope though. I'm not an expert by any means, so take what I say with a grain of salt."

Gunsforsale,39yhti,audible_dog_fart,2,Tue Jun 16 00:20:52 2015 UTC,So 25% off for being used is actually in OPs favor since guns typically lose 30% of their value used.
Gunsforsale,39yhti,robertey,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"Possibly. There's a lot of variables. For one, shipping without an FFL is ridiculous. Then there's the matter of transfer fees, sales tax, etc. Not all guns lose value used, some gain it (not a Taurus, but collectible ones.)"
Gunsforsale,39yhti,audible_dog_fart,2,Tue Jun 16 01:12:02 2015 UTC,MSRP - 30% is s reasonable expectation for selling a gun used.
Gunsforsale,39yhti,22lrHoarder,2,Tue Jun 16 00:41:38 2015 UTC,You realize shipping is gonna cost at least 20-40 depending on how you do it since it needs to be done 2nd day air.

Gunsforsale,39xf0q,CaliMaup,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"Wyndham, ME bushmasters are considered old and are usually regarded as having good quality control and craftsmanship (at least for a mid price AR).  After they were bought out by the Freedom Group/Cerberus Capital, they moved production to Ilion NY and tried to maximize profits at the expense of everything else.  Quality declined, workmanship declined.  Reliability decreased significantly.  You'll probably not have too many issues selling a Wyndham Bushmaster AR-15 but there are many who would not buy a freedom group bushmaster for any price because the reputation and reliability just isn't there.  EDIT:  You will find the location stamped on the lower receiver just above the trigger on the left side (the side with the bolt release).  Also, after his company was bought out by the freedom group, the man who originally owned bushmaster hated to see what they did to his old company so he went and rehired many of his old crew and formed ""Wyndham Weaponry"" which produces quality AR-15s"

Gunsforsale,39qlgx,johnmomdoe,3,Sat Jun 13 22:47:47 2015 UTC,$600 isn't outrageous. It's difficult for many of us to picture selling an AR for less than $600. He'll probably end up keeping or trading it.

Few of the Garands I've seen at a gunshow have ever been worth close to what they were asking, and very few few if any of them were actually as they were described by the seller. I say pass. The best way to be sure you're getting something good is to get one from the CMP. Get your order in now because the supply is finite."
Gunsforsale,38x4gw,GTbulldog,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as an ""all matching"" Garand. There are parts correct M1's, but not numbers matching. Garand components are marked with a drawing number, not serial numbers. The rifle he has could be parts correct, but its impossible to tell without pictures of all the parts/drawing numbers.   A lot of the parts correct rifles on the market today are service grades from the CMP that people buy and put the correct parts on. These are known as corrected rifles and are not worth as much as a genuine correct, which has its original parts from the factory. I cannot tell if the rifle in question here is correct/corrected, but it looks like a respectable service grade. $1300 is way over valued in my opinion, unless it comes with a correct grade certification from the CMP. I wouldn't pay more than $850.  Edit: I've been collecting these rifles for a few years. The CMP forum is probably the best resource for information on the subject. If you want to get serious about collecting then pick up Bruce Canfields ""The M1 Garand Rifle"". Its a fantastic book and is an invaluable resource. Just be careful, the are addicting!"

[WTS] H&K P30s .40 Cal in box w/ 5 factory mags, 1900 Rounds of .40 and 2 Custom Holsters [CO]CO submitted 26 days ago * by [deleted] This is a sweet deal that I am offering. This is your dream carry/duty/home defense kit. I built this amazing bug-out pistol kit that I am only replacing as I wanted to move to a 1911. The p30 in 40 with a safety is very hard to find, I encourage to you check around to see if you can find any other offer like this. My preference is to meet at my FFL in Lakewood, CO, but I will consider shipping FFL to FFL pending my comfort on receiving payment. I am comfortable signing a purchase contract and will gladly pen one myself if that makes my buyer happy. Please see the detailed pictures [1] . I have maliciously priced each item out to include deprecation for the hardware and market value for the 1900 rounds of ammo. I am asking firm $2,000 FOR EVERYTHING. You get the whole kit, everything listed below. This price is reflective of market price and availability of all items, and is based in reason and research. When you check my math, be sure to adjust for shipping costs for 70lbs pf ammo, not cheap. This price includes everything listed below one P30 .40 cal w/ safety, in box, with hammer decocker and changeable grips. See below for more details. This model[2] . 19 Boxes of Winchester Ranger LEO (180 gr subsonic) MV $30 a box[3] and you just can't find this stuff any more. Very Very high quality. 9 Boxes of Federal (180 gn FMJ FN) MV is $19.50 a box[4] 10 Boxes MagTech (180 gn FMC) MV is $19.00 a box[5] 5 Factory Mags (13 round), very hard to find right now for the .40.[6] Custom made OWB Holster. Leather, made by Native American Leather Smith Michael Kole[7] and is very comfortable, can easily be worn all day. Custom Made IWB Holster. Leather, made by Utah-based UGB Holsters[8] . Makes gun truly invisible. FREE Ammo can for all the ammo. I'll also throw in some cleaning supplies. This firearm comes with box, papers, copy of original receipt, manual, factory-fired round in sealed envelope, CAL safety key and adjustable side and backplates. This firearm has less then 1000 rounds through it, so it's just started to have been broken it. It was meticulously cared for, has no damage, scratches or other issues. Very light holster wear from a leather holster that is near impossible to see unless very close inspection. Gun currently has grip tape on, I will happily remove if buyer is not interested. Grip-tape hides no damage, will remove and send more photos for serious buyer. This gun has NEVER been put into a plastic holster, dropped, subjected to water or home-gunsmithing, or abused in any other way. All ammo has been stored in ammo cans in dry indoor-storage and has no water damage of any kind. Thank you for taking the time to read this post."

Not expensive, but something to consider.  My recoil buffer basically disintegrated after putting the first few rounds through it.  There's a bunch of info on the internet about these replacements."
Gunsforsale,38isbc,funkymonk7777777,2,Thu Jun 4 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely correct.  Plan on replacing the buffer and keep spares.   The magazines are compatable with 59 series mags and the guns work great.  A local LEO agency in my area used these in the late 80s and early 90s but dropped them because of broken buffers.  This agency used to issue S&W handguns and a +p+ 115gr bullet but switched to a 147gr like everybody else did around that time.  Its been too many years to remember the actual numbers but I remember they weren't getting much more velocity out of the carbine.  Better accuracy and ergonomics, but not much ballistics."

Gunsforsale,38cxqr,war-scribe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:44:28 2015 UTC,I would guess no. Its a bit big for pocket carry. Buy I carried it for a few months in the IWB holster I'm selling with it.

Gunsforsale,38bi0g,SmithWessonMP,3,Wed Jun 3 03:41:11 2015 UTC,Shield is always the better choice
Gunsforsale,38bi0g,weinhimer,-1,Wed Jun 3 03:42:42 2015 UTC,Shields are garbage. You should save up $50-100 and buy a much better gun.
Gunsforsale,38bi0g,becomelegendxdddd,2,Sun Jun 7 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"Hahaha yes. much better. Less capacity, less proven, will probably have a recall in three months, and junk sights. ""Better""."

Gunsforsale,3869ax,Esrange,2,Tue Jun 2 04:02:30 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not in bad shape.  Well, I sold mine in rougher condition for $175 locally, but mine was in .38 S&W and it was to an old collector.  I would expect a reasonable price to be around $220-$250, but that's just my opinion. Those old S&W's can go for a pretty penny to the right guy.  Are the grips ivory?"
Gunsforsale,3869ax,Esrange,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:41:07 2015 UTC,Yessir the grips are ivory. And the other side of the pistol is in a little worse shape. Like if I rated the right side out of 10 it would be about a 6 and the left side would be about a 4.7
Gunsforsale,3869ax,Esrange,2,Tue Jun 2 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"Then I'd bump it up to $275, maybe $300. Not as many collectors for those old S&W's, but they're fine guns. Lots of guys who own them still shoot them, albeit with low-power loads."

Gunsforsale,385ltv,tbmcrowley,2,Tue Jun 2 00:42:59 2015 UTC,I think the downvotes indicate your asking price is still too high.
Gunsforsale,385ltv,SomeTechDude,-2,Tue Jun 2 03:11:17 2015 UTC,The only place that has them in stock is charging $250+shipping for unknown condition (1907-1910) and no guarantee of matching numbers or wood grips. I think $280 shipped is fair. It's basically $10 for a better guarantee than a best of five hand pick (that they're not offering) and $20 for shipping when my guy charges a flat rate of $10+ actual shipping cost. I'm taking a loss at this price.
Gunsforsale,385ltv,SomeTechDude,2,Tue Jun 2 03:17:59 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that hurts if you actually paid more than this for it.  Good luck!"
Gunsforsale,385ltv,Jelway723,-2,Tue Jun 2 03:21:21 2015 UTC,"I paid a little less, but with shipping, I'd be behind. The current value is about $250. AIM sold out in under two days at $220 a piece back in February when they last had them. They're auctioning for even more."
Gunsforsale,385ltv,Hovsky,2,Tue Jun 2 03:24:46 2015 UTC,What they are charging isn't what they are worth. They are $150 guns.

I think the shipping is free so you'd be coming in at about $420 depending on your FFL transfer fee but that's without the holsters.    I've heard that the newer M&P's come with better triggers than the older ones, which his likely is."
Gunsforsale,37yu1g,farinx,2,Sun May 31 17:39:24 2015 UTC,If it was me. I would buy it new and get some holster that I like. Does two holster are worth less than 150. The price difference if new and used makes it a no deal for me.

Gunsforsale,37yu1g,jassack04,2,Sun May 31 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"I'd probably offer $350. $400 is not much of a deal considering they can easily be found new around $400 or a tad more, and used holsters are not worth much, especially from the bigger commercial mfgs (Galco, Blackhawk)."
Gunsforsale,37yu1g,robertey,1 point,Sun May 31 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"Pass. 300 would be a fine deal for just the gun, but those can be had NIB all day for 400 or less.   SERPA holsters are silly stupid unless you're required to have one, and soft IWB leather holsters suck."

Gunsforsale,37ql37,lightanddeath,1 point,Sat May 30 14:15:23 2015 UTC,I realize that. The price takes into account what comes with it as well. Also the fact that I have never sold anything where someone didn't offer less. So why not start at the highest end rather than what I expect to get and then get offered less still.  I'm not out to rip anyone off. In fact I may have someone coming today to take it off my hands for a fair amount less than its listed for.

I would make him pay $50 bucks plus the gun, because really the glock is worth more, because of one extra magazine.  A wasr +1 mag runs between 499-$525.  Brand new G30S with 3 Mags runs 550-600, subtract 10% for being used on both ends, and I would ask that guy to pay more, because just for 1-2 extra mags you are paying 20-40 bucks for the WASR."

I sell those used all day long for 525, almost 590 brand new.  A used WASR is max 525 in my book, with atleast 2-3 magazines."

Gunsforsale,37ou8a,Sit-Rep,1 point,Sat May 30 14:41:07 2015 UTC,That's because they don't make a Glock 30S in a generation 4. The Glock 30S uses a 30SF frame with a Glock 36 sized slide.

If it is a comb riser sleeve it can be like $30 but if it is actually built into the stock it goes way up from there.    U/O are beautiful guns and always are high, even the lower end guns."

Gunsforsale,37ngr0,igrulks,1 point,Fri May 29 02:57:44 2015 UTC,"With a red dot, users with astigmatism often find that the dot is fuzzy, star shaped, or blurry. A quick test to see how it is supposed to look for a person with normal vision is to look at the dot through a small iron sight aperature. For me the dot is much smaller and perfectly round when viewed that way. It's about twice as large when viewed with my naked eye. I'm not sure how severe my astigm is."

Gunsforsale,37nywv,Tungsten7,0,Fri May 29 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"They've all been fired at the range, and are always cleaned and lubricated afterward.   I've had the Glock for about 2 years, the XDS for maybe a year, and about a year for the Canik, also."
Gunsforsale,37nywv,tbmcrowley,1 point,Fri May 29 01:28:10 2015 UTC,Estimated round counts?
Gunsforsale,37nywv,Mattabeedeez,1 point,Fri May 29 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say ~3,000 rounds through the Glock, ~500 in the XDS, ~500 through the Canik."
Gunsforsale,37nywv,Mattabeedeez,2,Fri May 29 02:36:48 2015 UTC,I have a hard time going any lower than $400 for a used Glock that functions. Shouldn't have trouble getting between $400 and $500. Ask $475.   The Canik id go for like $275-$300. It's a good gun with a high capacity and some nice features and extras if you still have the original package. Wouldn't sell lower than $250.   At your round counts you could charge over MSRP because you've just broken them in a little. /s if you took them to Cabelas you'd probably get like $400 for BOTH. It's ridiculous up there.   Edit- no idea about the XDS but I'd price is comparably to the Glock. Just shoot for no less than 80% of what you paid.
Gunsforsale,37nywv,Mattabeedeez,0,Sat May 30 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"shoot for no less...   I see what you did there!   Thanks for helping me out with this. I'm also hoping that having the cases and manuals helps a bit. I also have a bunch of mags for the XDS.  I'm thinking of replacing the XDS 45 with a Glock 30S as my carry gun, as 10+1 rounds of .45 ACP > 5+1."
Gunsforsale,37nywv,Mattabeedeez,2,Sat May 30 19:35:13 2015 UTC,I have a G23 and Canik TP9. If you have a Taurus 1911 we might be bros.

Gunsforsale,37jz2u,CptRobBob,2,Thu May 28 04:25:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the price but I wouldn't sell it. That is a gun you could buy a box of rounds for and store it for the next 80 years.

Gunsforsale,37jz2u,bazooked,2,Thu May 28 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest thats pretty much exactly what I've been thinking.   I went and shot it today and enjoyed it. Not the most accurate handgun I've ever shot, but I wouldn't have any trouble hitting center mass if the need ever arose. It's exactly the type of handgun I'd put in a secure hidden location in a car or office. And to be honest I've been wanting a revolver.   Thanks for the input."
Gunsforsale,37jz2u,82_Silverwing,2,Thu May 28 05:15:21 2015 UTC,"Face to face, I'd offer $200, and let you talk me up as high as $250 for one in that condition.   I often carry a blued Carter Arms .38 in a Galco Tuck-N-Go IWB holster, and can easily pass the shooting test for the Texas CHL using it. pick up a couple of Bianchi speed strips to handle reloads.  The fixed sights are pretty much the limiting factor on the accuracy, and it's important to find ammo that shoots to the desired point of aim. Mine likes 158 grain HP's, but will function fine with anything in a pinch. Avoid the super lightweight rounds, as they are a gimmick and fail to penetrate."

I only have two 15 round mags and one 5 round mag so you would have to purchase others separately. I do have ammo with it as well but I am not sure if you would want it as it's fairly old stuff and with how expensive it is to ship for me it may be cheaper to buy it online. I can get some more pictures this evening with a few more details. I can't measure the trigger pull but after shooting a few M1 carbines I would say it's trigger pull is average, with a fairly heavy but crisp trigger pull."
Gunsforsale,37i9bb,Ruhlmdc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the tactical foot pictures but here is the best I could get of the bore. The barrel is very clean and has a mirror finish on it. Rifling is fair, with grooves left but they are slightly worn. I dropped a round into the muzzle to see the muzzle erosion and it looks to be around a 3 or 4 on the CMP scale which would put it on the same level as a Field grade M1 Garand.

Gunsforsale,36sdlv,FlyingPeacock,1 point,Fri May 22 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"Not if they're Baikal made. There are some that came into the US in the early 90s that are just okay. The actual military ones are eligible for C&R status, the newer ones obviously not. That said, the Russian ones aren't bad, but can be found for less. If possible talk the guy down to $300. It wouldn't be the steal of the century, but you also would be paying a much fairer price. If it is an actual military gun, then the $350 is fair.  /u/jakesgunreviews might be able to offer more advice. He is well versed on the PM."
Gunsforsale,36sdlv,tbmcrowley,3,Sat May 23 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"If it's a military Russian PM, expect $600+ because they weren't ever allowed for import.  There are only four ways I've found for them entering:   Vietnam bring-backs Some got imported with Bulgarian PMs and mislabeled as Bulgarian Russians brought some over with them (some say ""spies"" who ditched them upon leaving, but others say they were gifts to politicians or other high-ranking individuals they were communicating with while over here).  I've seen some post-Vietnam-dated ones with no import marks in like-new condition on GunBroker before, and that's really the only explanation people have been able to come up with. Some of our men didn't come back from Iraq/Afghanistan empty-handed.   Non-military Russian PMs are $300-400.00.  Bulgarian PMs are currently sub-$300.00 at AimSurplus."

Gunsforsale,36k8ch,Flextarn,1 point,Wed May 20 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"That's a nice rifle! I saw one at Cabela's in the Gun library for $1600. Almost bought it. I THINK it was 300 winmag... It had a basic, dusty Leopold scope on it, something I would've replaced had I bought it. It had a couple blemishes on the stock, nothing major. I don't know what yours would go for, but I hope that helps you decide."
Gunsforsale,36k8ch,WhatDoesN00bMean,1 point,Wed May 20 19:09:39 2015 UTC,"I was thinking maybe $1000 as I don't have a scope. Thank you, I appreciate your input."
Gunsforsale,36k8ch,WhatDoesN00bMean,2,Wed May 20 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"If it was a grand at Cabela's, I would have bought it. That's not a bad price for Sako. If it's in good condition. Good luck!"

Gunsforsale,36j2wc,darkbug,1 point,Wed May 20 01:21:11 2015 UTC,"bug I just got them and I only have a few... the fiber optics are stupid bright (as long as there is some light indoor, or outdoor... the reticle is torched in amber.). There is NO tritium, and of course it's nowhere near the quality of the Triji.. but it's a very, VERY nice optic with clear glass, the ""favorite"" cross-reticle and I think most guys would be pleasantly surprised with this little beast. If you decided to grab one to do a comparo I think you'd be pretty impressed.   Any other questions guys feel free to shoot. I'm always happy to help and talk guns."
Gunsforsale,36jx34,InventedLife,1 point,Tue May 19 22:51:19 2015 UTC,I have a 226 with rail that was a police turn in also.  $600 is what you can expect for one in good condition.

Gunsforsale,36kopn,igrulks,1 point,Thu May 21 14:29:39 2015 UTC,I got it at a gun show and didn't ask. I think all Model 1 Sales barrels in 6.8 are 9.5.

Gunsforsale,36j82r,SuperSix-Four,2,Tue May 19 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"$450 for the the gun and three mags is reasonable. I'd drop down to $50 for the two additional. I'd also drop down to $50 for the holster.   OP, I have the exact same setup as you. Wouldn't sell in a million years, but I'd say $500. Everything minus the holster is going for 550ish on Buds, and the holster would have been probably $40 bucks with shipping and everything, if I remember right."
Gunsforsale,36j82r,WeHaveFreshCookies,1 point,Tue May 19 22:10:04 2015 UTC,That's about what I'm thinking. I ended up replacing with a m&p9 and just like it better for whatever reason. Coworker wants it as a graduation gift to his son or I'd keep it as a truck gun or beater.
Gunsforsale,36j82r,WeHaveFreshCookies,1 point,Wed May 20 00:49:43 2015 UTC,I hear you. I use my FNX as a duty pistol and at competitions and I love it but its not ideal for everybody. It'd be a brilliant graduation gift though.

Gunsforsale,36g2bt,NoSuddenMoves,7,Tue May 19 03:03:31 2015 UTC,It would make a great rifle to pass down though the years. I'd love for someone to get the same enjoyment out of it that I had growing up shooting when I got my first .22
Gunsforsale,36g2bt,hoodpaladin,2,Tue May 19 03:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, great job with the finish on this one! Very pretty overall. Thank you for posting this- I just got two bolt action single shots for my girls or else I'd have snapped this one up."

Gunsforsale,36g3mh,Lylac_Krazy,2,Tue May 19 15:07:38 2015 UTC,If I could find one for $900 I would buy it in a heartbeat.  I'm not seeing anything sub $1K.

Gunsforsale,36fk1t,justgiveittime,1 point,Tue May 19 00:13:56 2015 UTC,I would probably start at $350 shipped. Like /u/kowabunga_dude said the ammo is really the only major added value.
Gunsforsale,36fk1t,zambezy,1 point,Tue May 19 01:28:07 2015 UTC,I'll buy it rt now.
Gunsforsale,36fk1t,Dee_dubya,1 point,Mon May 25 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"An online retailer has these for $340 right now. So maybe a little more with the ammo. I don't think many people will be interested in the cleaning kit, barrel brush (especially since the gun came with one), or your holster."
Gunsforsale,36defa,loudnoises461,1 point,Mon May 18 14:28:09 2015 UTC,Seems fairish if it comes with everything pictured.  I've seen lone Mak's for around $300 or in that ball park.
Gunsforsale,36defa,carsismeZ06,1 point,Mon May 18 14:46:42 2015 UTC,AIM has them for $260.

Gunsforsale,36defa,tbmcrowley,1 point,Mon May 18 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"AIM has ones in not as good condition with the black grip and one magazine (no holster) for $260. Holsters can be had for $12, mags for about $28, and the red bakelite grips for $15. So, $317 plus shipping and transfer.   I'd offer $330-$350 for this."

Unfortunately, my friends have wives and children that prevents them from going out often, like me. Our schedules rarely coincide. So, I'm just seeing if I can get a favorable price.   No wear other than basic: charging handle rub, bolt carrier rub, etc. It's been well-lubed and cleaned."

Gunsforsale,36aomw,ck323k,2,Mon May 18 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"back in the day when these we're $80 bucks bayonet and all. I absolutely would not pay $200 for a mosin.  Unless of course you're going to use it as a project gun. Check the bore and make sure its not drilled. If it is, then forget it."
Gunsforsale,36aomw,JackBrush,1 point,Tue May 19 22:34:57 2015 UTC,"The hard to come by ones are $180-$200 with a bayonet, sling, oil bottle, and clip pouches. 1942 and 1943 are the most common ones. 3 digit serial numbers are meaningless. There are two letter codes before the serial numbers to determine what lot it was made in. As far as I know, nobody has the serial number records.  I'd offer $150."
Gunsforsale,36aomw,tbmcrowley,1 point,Sun May 17 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"I've seen Pawn Shop Mosins in reasonable condition at 150$, wouldn't go much higher."

Gunsforsale,3688ge,Enroberman,2,Mon May 18 15:07:05 2015 UTC,Why?   because he wants to sell.  It only helps
Gunsforsale,3688ge,Herballistic,2,Sun May 17 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'll give you $600 for it, plus shipping and the like. That's a touch over 70% of retail, which is way more than you'd get from any store."

Gunsforsale,367vlo,Cubiclehero,3,Sun May 17 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"It's a refurb, so I assume it is force matched.  The Black BBQ paint type finish plus the stamped square with the line through it are dead give a ways.   Also the stock looks re finished.  I am Canadian and can get Russians for $175 so I have had a few,  this one isnt that great condition wise.  Hold out for a SKS that has the original bluing and stock finish."

Gunsforsale,367vlo,Bartman383,1 point,Sun May 17 03:45:29 2015 UTC,I would be happy to let you fire a few rounds through mine. Where you at?  I have been trying to get my FFL to import a crate of SKS's from Canada for me. Seems like the only way to get non-Chinese SKS at a reasonable price.
Gunsforsale,367vlo,Cubiclehero,1 point,Sun May 17 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I've bought two this year, a Yugo for $250 and a Norinco for $300.    Russians are just rarer. There was a numbers matching one for sale locally, but the guy wanted $600.  $500 is my max."
Gunsforsale,367vlo,Crowing77,1 point,Mon May 18 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"Without seeing the serial numbers I can't say 100%.  But it has been refurbished, pretty heavy in my opinion, so odds are its force matched."
Gunsforsale,367vlo,BeardedPipeliner,1 point,Sun May 17 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the Russians had a habit of taking battle worn guns, swapping in replacement parts, then overwriting the old serial number for the part.  A lot of the Russian sks were released to the US like this.  It should still be a very good gun, but as mentioned above those with all original parts and blueing may be worth more.  There are a number of other factors as well.  Check out the Survivors Ska forums for more info.  The Canadians are lucky, as I think they're still importing them up there, so you can get really nice ones extra cheap!"

The bore is nice and bright  and it is not counter bored (I would take a picture but my phone absolutely will not take a good bore shot). Aside from that it is a very nice rifle for being 72 years old.  Reasonable offers will be considered."

If I had a set I would buy a colt trooper the next day.  Hickok45 is a household name to anyone who is into firearms and knows how to use the internet, if he did a reddit AMA it would blow the fuck up, I don't buy a firearm without looking at online reviews and he's usually the first one I check out. How did you come by the grips?"
Gunsforsale,3652ra,NoSuddenMoves,3,Sat May 16 07:15:27 2015 UTC,I offered him a set of grips he mentioned that he was looking for and in return denting me his signed pair.

Gunsforsale,362dgx,dw0r,3,Fri May 15 14:49:56 2015 UTC,I'd say around $400
Gunsforsale,362dgx,zambezy,2,Fri May 15 15:50:19 2015 UTC,400 Would be about the highest you could hope to get. In my area LGS's sell compacts for $430. I'm in Indiana.
Gunsforsale,362dgx,ciridan,2,Fri May 15 18:43:24 2015 UTC,Just the subcompact here (Vermont) is about $450 after tax but the one with the extra junk (holster mag holster and loader) like mine is about $550 after tax. I figure I can probably get $300-$350 pretty smoothly.

It's crazy light and that grey finish is perfect. I will say I don't like the trigger at all; the trigger on my Colt LE6720-R is 100x better but swap that with a Geissele SSA-E and you have one slick rifle

I use to keep one in my house/car for very close range.   If you are a comfortable shooter then go with a different gun. My light weight stays in my ladys car as she can just ""point and shoot"". $300 is not a bad price, depending on wear.   edit: its a great close range car gun. I think that is what it was originally  designed for."

Gunsforsale,35nw3y,NoSuddenMoves,2,Tue May 12 14:06:33 2015 UTC,IMO I'd say $1500+ depending on how fast you want to sell it.  Probably a limited market of people that want a bolt action at that price. You might want to sell it in pieces as you're in the M1A price range.
Gunsforsale,35nw3y,Skittlesharts,1 point,Tue May 12 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's about what I was thinking on the lower end--I've been shooting for 1700 at the moment. The limited market and package deal were also concerns of mine, and I may end up parting it out if I have too much difficulty. Would be a shame though, I think someone that wants to start shooting long range will get a lot of joy right out of the box with this."

Gunsforsale,35m4q0,mateodiabeto,3,Mon May 11 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Its a tough call without being able to see it.  Average post war carbines tend to be in the $450-600+ range.  I'd err towards the lower end for a .32 and maybe towards the higher end for a .30-30.  Depending on the severity of the stock scuffs, $500-ish is probably solidly fair for both parties.  You could probably find a better deal and he might be able to get more for it.  And again, this is all speculation,  this also assumes it is original and doesn't have a bunch of extra holes drilled or anything like that."
Gunsforsale,35m4q0,BenSharps,1 point,Mon May 11 18:27:35 2015 UTC,No extra holes drilled.  The scuffs on the stock aren't very deep but they cover a significant portion of both the butt stock and the forend
Gunsforsale,35m4q0,Starfire66,2,Mon May 11 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I picked up a '56 Winchester model 94 30-30 in extremely good shape.  The only things wrong with it were a missing ring around the front sight and the little ramp for the rear sight missing as well, but the rest of the gun is damn near perfect for $500 with 200 rounds of ammo included.  I was told by a couple other people more knowledgeable than I am about those rifles that I did okay on it with the price.  Nothing excessive, but not a smoking hot deal either."
Gunsforsale,35m4q0,longhairedcountryboy,1 point,Tue May 12 14:40:12 2015 UTC,Pre-64 makes it worth more.  Winchester started using stamped parts instead of machined in 1964.  If it's in good condition it would be towards the higher end of the price range.

Gunsforsale,35lxd5,slups,1 point,Fri May 15 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"The most noticeable would be the barrel length, the K11 barrel is a few inches shorter. I've never shot a K31 so I can't say for sure, but from what I hear from people that have, the K11 is slightly easier to handle and the bolt is a little smoother on the pull. Also, there were significantly less K11's made than K31's, so spare parts are harder to come by."

I got one of them about 2y ago at a pawn shop with the vent rib barrel, winchoke set and an extra slug barrel for $250 out the door.  I picked up another one for $200 with a standard field barrel a little before that.  Decent guns.  They are based off the 1200/1300 platform, but cheaper wood.  Nothing at all wrong with any of them I have seen as far as functioning correctly.  Depending on how the bluing is, and which barrel it has, I would place it between $150-$225."

Gunsforsale,35b7w4,bravejango,7,Fri May 8 19:06:30 2015 UTC,There is this thing called the internet. You might not have heard of it living in kansas but it's actually the same place you are trying to sell you're gun. Anyone living in Kansas can go to buds gun shop or cheaper than dirt and order a new gun with the same accessories for the same price as what you are trying to sell a used gun for.
Gunsforsale,35b7w4,bravejango,-7,Fri May 8 19:38:14 2015 UTC,Omg a Kansas joke how original! It's a private sale in the state of Kansas and I get to price a weapon sale with what I feel comfortable with. Please refrain from commenting unless you are interested in a sale. Your comments are a negative presence on our community.
Gunsforsale,35b7w4,Enroberman,6,Fri May 8 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"You can price the gun at 10 grand for all anyone cares. But people will let others know when some jackass is trying to fleece them.  You are charging new prices for a used gun, no one cares if you include a holster and some ammo. If I can let someone know that they can log onto buds gun shop and have a known new gun shipped to their local FFL. And buy a new holster and ammo for just a few bucks more then your untested used gun then I will let them know.   Edit  You also stated that the holster is a cheapo nylon OTW holster which screams to me 10~20 bucks new."

It would also be fair to ask about the rifling. These were made with very shallow rifling, and unless it a low mileage version, that can be an issue. also accuracy on these can be all over the board due to large differences between chamber and bore size. Ideal is .002 or less difference between those.  I been looking for one for several years to find a good condition, not shot out, accurate shooter. You are asking a fair price if yours meets those criteria.  If it does not, I wish you the best."

You can put $3000 rims in it, $2000 speakers etc, but at the end of the days it's worth what it is.  Nothing wrong with a Frankenstein ar, but once you start getting into the $1250 range, if you wait, you can buy yourself a crazy nice ar.  Just think, are you really going to shoot it that much to justify $1200+, or should you get a $800 rifle (which can still be made super nice) and then get a nice 1911 or whatever too.  It's a free country but I sell people rifles all the time that I then see a year later on arms list ""brand new in box"" that they are going to take a massive hit on.

Gunsforsale,354o8v,dhabs,2,Thu May 7 03:32:33 2015 UTC,That really sucks.
Gunsforsale,354o8v,SomeTechDude,3,Thu May 7 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty standard for there to be background checks from FFLs even if it is ""local"". In OR standard fee is $10 to have a background check ran so if a shop is charging anything more than $10 and your buying a gun from them I typically go elsewhere. It's not the shops fault they have to charge you $X for a background check that goes to the state that goes into DFW etc.  Most small shops have a very minimal profit margin on the products they sell and hardly make any profit themselves. If they hoofed this cost for you they would maybe make nothing on the sale of the gun. In the end ( in OR at least) most the money will go back into shooting related activities which is definitely fine by me."

Gunsforsale,3524h6,kansasthrowawaygfs,4,Wed May 6 13:50:36 2015 UTC,You can buy a brand new one for $299 at academy.
Gunsforsale,3524h6,Fapmiester,2,Wed May 6 14:20:45 2015 UTC,Asking way too much. This would go for 250-300 tops. Like the other said the gun is new for 300.

Gunsforsale,353f9c,factionfx,2,Wed May 6 21:25:01 2015 UTC,No wait time. One was on sale at a retailer and I grabbed it.

Gunsforsale,34w29y,Starfire66,1 point,Tue May 5 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same setup with the BC folder and the long flash hider.  Only difference is yours has the better factory rear sight on it.  If you're not sure if that mount holds zero with the scope (I doubt it does with how cheap that scope/mount are, but you never know) then those are basically worthless.  I gave $550 for mine with a cracked rear sight and replaced that for $20, and mine came with 3 mags.  For what you have there, $600-$650 tops, unless you find a sucker."
Gunsforsale,34w29y,justarandomshooter,1 point,Tue May 5 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"A thousand, maybe more.  This based largely on the stock, which is highly sought after, hard to find and decades out of production.  It's the A-Team factor.  Tell you what, go to gunbroker.  Register for a free account.  Activate said account and log in.  To to advanced search, select completed auctions and enter your search string.  Mini 14 folding, etc.  That'll give you a sortable list of finished auctions.  Also, I'll buy the stock for $300 and send you a factory wood stock, shipping on me both ways. Just sayin!"
Gunsforsale,34w29y,Starfire66,1 point,Tue May 5 02:09:16 2015 UTC,"Untrue.  The stock he has is easily bought these days for ~120 give/take new or used for $75 or so.  The A-Team original side folders are REALLY desirable & expensive, but this is not one of those."

Gunsforsale,34w29y,NoSuddenMoves,0,Tue May 5 02:53:30 2015 UTC,<$700 for a new rancher mini. They were going for <$600 for police trade ins shipped to your FFL and sold out in a few days.  Your problem will be finding someone local who wants one.  Fl doesn't restrict AR's or AK's and most of the people scooping them up at those prices are in commie states that do. Shipping firearms is also a bitch unless you have an FFL.
Gunsforsale,34wl0u,Tossme1,7,Tue May 5 03:49:04 2015 UTC,aaaand this is why we can't find 22. Also why it's $40 a box instead of $15.

Honestly, all we can do is guess at this point. I have seen people wanting $1k+ for half converted Saigas, so who knows? Saigas are just going to go up in price. There isn't a definitive price yet, all we can do is guess.   I would put the 6 required US parts on your gun.

You can get an old italian police issued 92 for around $300 and a used G26 for <$500.  I'd hang onto that 1911 and pass it on to your grandson/granddaughter when your time comes. Also it looks like it could use some oil. IMO you should just shoot it once or twice a year and be thankful grandpa made that trade and didn't leave you a rusty old car."

I appreciate the concern for the sentiment, however. Honestly, I'd rather have had one of his cars. His life was in racing and car work, not firearms."

Gunsforsale,34l8ms,WeHaveFreshCookies,2,Sun May 3 05:33:54 2015 UTC,Wait the 6 months and keep this gun. It is something that will only gain money and in the future you will regret selling it.

Gunsforsale,34l8ms,Bluekestral,1 point,Sat May 2 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily that I think the 92 is smaller, I just feel less bad regularly shooting something that isn't this.  My thinking here is that it carries a few bad memories, and is also something I don't trust myself to maintain. If there's someone who's genuinely going to give it a good home, someone who genuinely wants it for the value it has, it's better off in their hands."

Gunsforsale,34h7nw,longhairedcountryboy,2,Fri May 1 12:37:09 2015 UTC,Don't shoot it.  Don't refinish it. It's worth more as is.  As for value look for recent sales on gunbroker or a similar site

Gunsforsale,34d3du,ChuckieC,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:24:31 2015 UTC,so how much is a .308 version? worth directly trading or sell first and then buy? i bought this rifle used for $400 but prefer the smaller caliber.
Gunsforsale,34d3du,ChuckieC,2,Thu Apr 30 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"You could do either, but finding someone wanting to trade for a 30-06 might take longer than selling yours and buying a .308. The .308 is right around the same price as a 30-06"
Gunsforsale,34d3du,hobitopia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:04:24 2015 UTC,thanks
Gunsforsale,34d3du,hobitopia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Mostly pedantic here, but .30-06 and .308 are the same ""caliber"".   Also the only difference between the two is going to be a few ounces in rifle weight due to SA vs LA. .308 is nearly a ballistic twin to the .30-06, especially in factory loadings.   If you're looking for less power/kick, you won't even be able to notice the difference.  If that's the reason you're looking for something else you might want to look into something like 7mm-08 or some of the 6.5mm's."
Gunsforsale,34c9sm,Bloodless101,2,Thu Apr 30 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"24"" with rifle sights $250 new. You might get someone to buy it for $200, there's always noobs who don't know how to find gun deals looking for their first shotgun and it's usually this one. I'm also assuming it's a 12ga, other gauges might be more difficult to sell."
Gunsforsale,34c9sm,NoSuddenMoves,2,Thu Apr 30 02:17:14 2015 UTC,yes its a 12 ga. good to know. Thank you

Gunsforsale,34c9sm,gizram84,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:09:13 2015 UTC,That is a significantly older model than the one i am selling. Mine is from the late 90s. And the ones with dual action bars are much better in my opinon

Trying to determine if it's just a trauma plate or if it has some ballistic material behind it. Also how heavy is the plate?
Gunsforsale,343cye,timewasterextreme,2,Tue Apr 28 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"Imgur  Maybe that will help? (Thats a 9mm for size comparison) It appears to just be the ceramic plate, with no backing.

Gunsforsale,33z42c,Bartman383,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:18:12 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to give them a call and offer $300. Worst case is the seller says no.

Gunsforsale,33z42c,getoutandpush,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:07:46 2015 UTC,I thought so. I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't anything special or the market for these didn't changed drastically over the past year.
Gunsforsale,33z42c,NnAmeatloaf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:49:10 2015 UTC,Just bought a 77 off gunbroker still covered in Cosmo for $325. After shipping it was about $350. This was maybe 3 months ago.
Gunsforsale,33z42c,kaiserwilly,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:49:10 2015 UTC,I bought my yugo SKS w/ grenade launcher for $140 like 10 years ago. Times are a changn'
Gunsforsale,33z42c,kaiserwilly,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'd pass. They're excellent guns by all accounts, supposedly the most accurate of the SKSes. The ones with the grenade launchers are specifically the M59/66. They utilize a modified gas-piston system that, when the sights are flipped over for use as grenade sights, prevent gas from operating the action. This was done in order to ensure the rifle grenade had more propellant to launch it forward, thereby increasing range (which, in the case of a grenade, is always a good thing for the user!)  Only problem is that sometimes this system tends to have problems when shooting in semi-auto. I believe it's often due to Cosmo that's really deep in there keeping the shutoff stuck, or otherwise restricting the piston or something like that. I believe it's supposed to be a relatively simple fix.  But for $550 don't bother. I have an M59 Yugo, which they only made for  a few years before switching to M59/66, and I got that for $350. I'd say, based on the market I've seen, that a M59/66 should sell for around $350 or so."
Gunsforsale,33z42c,kaiserwilly,1 point,Sat May 2 19:24:18 2015 UTC,I offered $300 and showed him what they are worth. We eventually settled on $375 and I now own it. Now all I have to do is clean it.
Gunsforsale,33z42c,kaiserwilly,1 point,Sat May 2 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"Clean it how? Get cosmo off, or just a standard clean?  I'd say you got a fair price there, depending on condition and stuff. The barrels aren't chrome-lined, which is supposed to make them more accurate, but means they'll likely need to be cleaned more."
Gunsforsale,33z42c,kaiserwilly,1 point,Sat May 2 20:33:35 2015 UTC,Gotta get that lovely cosmo out. The previous owner bought it new and never took it out of the box.

Guy brought it in, had some good use, then a young kid bought it used, had it two days, and sold it back because he couldn't afford it. $450 is as low as they'll go, but it's still a good bit off the price of a NiB glock."
Gunsforsale,33vzk1,coachwyo,3,Sun Apr 26 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"Thats an expensive turn around for the kid.  I wasn't really looking for a Glock, much less a g19.

Some gun stores (like one up in bham) will jack up every gun 10-20%, and if you don't ask ""hey buddy, what's the best you can do on this?"" then the store takes your extra money and you're done. At this store, what's on the tag is what it costs.   Still sucks. And I hate telling customers no when they ask about price. But I reckon it's a fair way to do things."

Gunsforsale,33k9qx,Dead_Space,5,Thu Apr 23 05:06:40 2015 UTC,/u/Dead_Space has it right. Original thread is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/33k8vn/gun_collection_i_need_help_pricing_out_this_gun/  I was sent a bunch of pictures and names.
Gunsforsale,33k9qx,bazooked,3,Thu Apr 23 05:08:08 2015 UTC,"Picture 20 is a Savage/Stevens/Springfield (among other brandings, but a Savage Stevens design) 87/187 (among many other model designations) with a earlier large dish cocking knob. The value isn't great, but when maintained they are lovely rifles.   That particular one looks to me like an early 1950's (buckhorn stock, large dish cocking knob.) but the picture only shows a portion of what you'd need to see to know. It appears to be a non-factory D&T job (for a T or N mount it looks like), the factory holes were usually further back on the receiver and staked. I don't recognize that front sight however.  If the rear of the receiver is not dovetailed, chances are it's a 49-53. There should be a stamping where the barrel mates with the receiver that can identify the guns manufactured between 1949 and 1968, a simple alphabet code.  (A-'49, B='50, C='51, D='52, E='53, etc.)"
Gunsforsale,33k9qx,walker10837,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:32:43 2015 UTC,This is great info! I will be sure to check this out.
Gunsforsale,33k9qx,livin4donuts,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"When I said the value isn't great,  I meant that stateside they tend to sell from between 50 (for the junkers and clunkers, even lower for the parts guns) and about 250 for fantastic specimens, as you've already discovered.   They are pretty neat guns though. They have gills on the side of the receiver (that one should have 8) to vent carbon and crud out the side, as well as the trigger stays back after firing until you release it, also for venting purposes. The bolt can be locked forward for firing shorts, or, if you just want to use it as a straight pull rather than as a semi-automatic.  I have two of them, a 1953 Stevens 87C, and a 1956 Stevens 87D, and they are my go-to grouse guns, as well as just a heck of a lot of fun.  They are also pretty good to train a new ""older"" shooter on (the 24 inch barrel means it's a bit awkward for some smaller new shooters) because of the slower cyclic rate (the click-clack, which hopefully you'll grow to love if you buy the collection) and the aforementioned straight-pull functionality."
Gunsforsale,33j0qz,wirespeed1,2,Wed Apr 22 22:24:03 2015 UTC,Just wanted to chime in and say that these mats are great. Even if you do not use them for cleaning they also make great mouse pads.

Also a hell of a deal considering the view is so much better with this vs. a spotting scope (espeically at 1000yd) around that price. Good luck with the sale.
Gunsforsale,33in1e,jayemo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:09:49 2015 UTC,Thanks man. It is sooooo much better than a spotting scope. How else can you see bullet holes at 500 yards?

Gunsforsale,334str,George_Hayduke,0,Sun Apr 19 17:28:59 2015 UTC,So 60 dollars shipped isn't the same as 60 dollars shipped?

Gunsforsale,32zz91,dhabs,25,Sat Apr 18 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"I know you want a simple answer, but there isn't one.  If you don't care if you're paying too much and you just want a Luger offer them $1000 and be happy you own one.  But if you want to make sure you are paying a fair price, read on.  You should spend a full day or so reading through lugerforum.com at a minimum and identify other online resources you can use.  Even better buy some books on Lugers and then do some more research.  There are about 999 ways to make a bad Luger purchasing decision.    Pawn shops can be weird in that they often significantly overprice pedestrian guns and rarely drastically under price things that are rarer or unique.  Lugers aren't rare or unique for the most part, but the ones that are can command insane premiums.  Start with determining    What vintage is it What manufacturer is it Russian capture, import marked, or clean Is it in original condition   Has it been re-blued Has the barrel been re-sleeved Does it have replacement grips  does the mag or mags match the gun (wooden vs metal base, numbered vs not)  Is it ALL matching - Most Lugers have at least a partial serial nbr on pretty much every part What caliber is it (9mm or .30 Luger)   Do you want a ""shooter"" or a ""collector""?    I own a ""shooter"" Luger that is a 1915 DWM all matching w/ original grips but it was nicely re-blued.  It looks like the perfect Luger, beautiful blue and nice straw.  It has NO collector value.  Whereas a black widow, in decent condition, all-matching might bring $2500 or more depending on date code and accessories.  Finally an all matching, all-original artillery Luger with mags, holster, and stock might bring $4000 or more.  Good luck!"

Gunsforsale,330vue,CannibalVegan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:45:09 2015 UTC,Tromix should be able to build you a .450 or .458 for around your price.
Gunsforsale,32z8py,ConstableGrey,3,Fri Apr 17 23:32:54 2015 UTC,Definitely check bore and ME and TE if possible.  I have heard the Blue Sky's were rode hard and put away wet.  If the bore is decent I think this is a good deal.
Gunsforsale,32z8py,fluffy_butternut,2,Sat Apr 18 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"Seems decent to me.  I am not that knowledgeable but I have seen much worse go for much more.  I think the stock looks new and the Blue Sky import mark detract from the collector value, which might be why he's not asking $1000.  If you have a .30 cal bullet/cartridge, you can check the muzzle.  If it drops in to the case, the barrel is shot out.  That can be replaced - check out Fulton Armory."
Gunsforsale,32z8py,jimmythegeek1,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll sure it give that a try when I go look it over in person.

Gunsforsale,32z8py,the_nerdster,2,Sat Apr 18 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"$500 seems like way too good of a deal. I see M1's do 1000+ on GunBroker pretty often, I'd take a good look at as much of the internals as you can. The big import mark might be doing a number on the price, but I don't know enough to judge. Call it like you see it I guess?"
Gunsforsale,32z8py,the_nerdster,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"He said he was only charging $500 because I do a lot of business with him, and he's not interested in historical stuff and knows I am.

Gunsforsale,32wfx7,souobixo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Same here. I don't mean to be rude either. I'm just really confused about why you would put so much money into a rifle and then immediately try to sell it knowing full well you're probably going to take at least a 20% loss on it. I wonder about the large number of posts I already see for guns with 200 rounds through them. Is it guys buying guns before they know if they'll enjoy them? Hilary Clinton wives find out that their husbands got off the leash and lay down the law? Those I can understand, but yours baffles me.  I'm sure you could offer a reply and I'd be saying,""Oh. Okay. I guess that makes sense."" As it is, if you're trying to build to make a profit, remember that it is extremely difficult to do, and almost never works with custom weapons."
Gunsforsale,32wfx7,souobixo,2,Fri Apr 17 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"To be consice, let's just say I started making a lot more money with refinishing firearms when this was all parts other then a barrel, so I purchased a barrel and put it together.

Gunsforsale,32pi6b,Sit-Rep,3,Wed Apr 15 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"Sure that's not a 590? The barrel retaining cap looks like it.   Also, what kind of stock adapter is that? It resembles the Mesa Tactical adapter, which isn't cheap.   Hell, for the foreend, stock, and possibility that it's actually a 590, that's worth jumping on for somebody."
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,alc6379,2,Thu Apr 16 07:16:33 2015 UTC,its a cheap ATI one the guy put on.
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,diagela,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"I have to ask, any indication on the date of manufacture for the 870? who made the barrels? also does the 24"" barrel have a bead sight and/or vent rib? any info on the Nikon scope? By pure coincidence I will be in OP this weekend."
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,diagela,2,Wed Apr 15 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"24 inch barrel vent rib with brass bead.  Its an express model, so I am dating it before 2008 based on the SN.  The nikon scope is a nikoplex fixed power model."
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,diagela,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:53:11 2015 UTC,"man you aren't leaving me much room to say no to this deal. I do wish it was a 28"" barrel, but your price is right. does it have a choke installed? either way, I need to think about this, and also see what I might have to offer in trade."
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,diagela,2,Wed Apr 15 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"it does have a choke installed, but it has not been taken out to even see what it is.  this was traded to me, and I have never even fired it.  I know the 18 incher has a IC bore.  The 24 inch I have no clue, but a choke is installed.  PM me and let me know what you have, and maybe we can work something out.  I have a shooting competition in the morning on saturday, but friday or sunday I am free."
Gunsforsale,32pi6b,NoSuddenMoves,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"awesome, I don't much care which choke it is, as long as something is in there protecting the threads, and it's compatible with Remington chokes. I assume since it has rifle sights, the 18"" barrel is actually rifled, correct? I will PM you when I come up with something."
Gunsforsale,32pc6a,Sit-Rep,3,Wed Apr 15 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"$390 is a little high.  My numbers matching Norinco cost me $300, my matching Yugo was $250.  Both bought this year."
Gunsforsale,32pc6a,Bartman383,2,Thu Apr 16 18:40:13 2015 UTC,You can get a Chinese type 56 for 300 bucks still and those have chrome lined barrels and are roughly B grades. I'd buy one of those instead.
Gunsforsale,32pc6a,brainleak,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:37:55 2015 UTC,What's the price?
Gunsforsale,32pc6a,Shadoe17,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"updated post.  $390, or cash price 375."
Gunsforsale,32pc6a,zaboomafoo357,0,Wed Apr 15 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Compared to what I've seen on local facebook trading groups, I'd personally pay $375, but you may be able to get them lower. Locally people are listing unmolested Norinco SKS's for $550, and even more for tactifucked SKS's.  Just my 2 cents. I may be completely wrong. It just seems com-bloc weapons keep going up in price."
Gunsforsale,32os83,TheNinthDoc,3,Wed Apr 15 14:32:45 2015 UTC,"I had to look this up. Never knew it existed. anyway, Colt still sells this as the XSE model for, wait for it, around $1100.00 retail.  I am sure the early models are quite nice, but that premium seems to be in the ""meth"" area, well beyond crack pricing."

Gunsforsale,32os83,NoSuddenMoves,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:09:47 2015 UTC,I think it comes with one
Gunsforsale,32os83,NoSuddenMoves,0,Thu Apr 16 01:33:11 2015 UTC,Then i'd probably pass. I just picked up a Colt 1991A1(80 series) for $700 from Kentucky Gun Co last month for a 460 Rowland conversion.  You could probably still find one from Colts last batch for around $800.

Gunsforsale,32mmj1,ohwtfdude,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:25:33 2015 UTC,yup.
Gunsforsale,32krb7,pine_clad,4,Tue Apr 14 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say around $600 for the rifle, pre-acquisition Marlins typically run about a $100 premium over post-acquisition, and I purchased a good condition Remington-made 1895 Guide Gun for $500 a few months back. Those 200 rds of ammo would probably be worth at least $250 by themselves. I'd say that was a good trade for a plain Mini-14."
Gunsforsale,32krb7,hotel_torgo,2,Tue Apr 14 18:03:47 2015 UTC,What doesn't work on the safety?  It doesn't prevent the trigger from being pulled or the hammer from moving. It just keeps the hammer from hitting the firing pin. That is correct function.
Gunsforsale,32krb7,cawpin,3,Tue Apr 14 17:13:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm used to triggers not being able to be pulled at all when the safety is on. This is the first lever gun I've ever had. So I guess the safety does most likely work.
Gunsforsale,32krb7,dotMJEG,2,Tue Apr 14 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Great gun, generally sell for between $500 and $800 used. JM stamped are almost always $600+, most are in the $7-800 range, at least round my parts.   Definitely a better gun than the mini-14 IMO."
Gunsforsale,32m1fk,WhatIskarmuh,3,Tue Apr 14 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"For that price get a PTR.  I had a Century Cetme.  I paid $287 for it back in the early 2000's.  I eventually traded it away because I hated it.  It always went bang and was decently accurate but everything else sucked.  No optic rail and a shitty rear rotating leaf sight.  The Stanang mount I added for optics had to be tightened down so much so it wouldn't walk back during recoil that it made charging the weapon harder than needed.    Keep in mind all those mags sell for like $2 each, so they aren't adding much value.  The furniture is worth a bit more, but honestly, what the fuck are you going to do with four extra sets of furniture?  I guess you could sell them, but again, it's all cheap stuff."
Gunsforsale,32m1fk,Bartman383,2,Wed Apr 15 14:16:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I think I am going to pass on this one and look around for something with higher quality.

Gunsforsale,32m1fk,Opienus,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Not a problem! If you're looking for something similar at a similar price, check out CDNN and look at their PTR-91s. An updated version of the CETME that is really reliable and some of the best bang for the buck."
Gunsforsale,32lo9f,DisappointedBoner,2,Tue Apr 14 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"If you like it, get it. $200 is nothing, if you decide you don't want it, I'm sure you'll get that back out of it."
Gunsforsale,32lo9f,TeeReks,2,Tue Apr 14 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on the wear. Taurus has a lifetime repair warranty regardless of the owner If its in semi good condition (no gouges, dents, scrapes, uncleanable rust), grab it. The case of bullets makes it a good deal. As a side note,I have never had a problem with a taurus, their trigger pull is heavy, but they are great guns to have around the house."
Gunsforsale,32lo9f,jango82,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:36:36 2015 UTC,I went ahead and bite the bullet and bought it. It's solid and in good shape And I think a pretty good price point
Gunsforsale,32lo9f,jango82,2,Wed Apr 15 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"You dont bite the bullets, you put them in the pistol. Good luck."
Gunsforsale,32i95c,capecodcaper,4,Tue Apr 14 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"I don't see any major wear, check internals and all that though. Some people forget the DE can't run heavy 10mm and some internals show a loooot of wear if that's what they've been shooting.  Wouldn't go higher than 650."
Gunsforsale,32i95c,the_nerdster,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:58:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info  Why does that seem so low? By gauging on gunbroker the average price is much higher than that  What should I look at specifically for the internals?
Gunsforsale,32i95c,the_nerdster,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"General wear really. Worn extractor, bushings, anything that looks like it's been ""ground"" by contact with other pieces of the gun. If the guy gives you a low round count like 5-600 but the gun looks beat to hell, he's been shooting heavy 10 not designed for the Delta action.  Also my price is pretty lowball, lots of gunbroker auctions are going around 8-900 I'm guessing? I just feel if I'm paying that much for a used gun, I could get a new one for like $200 more.  Also IIRC, the new Delta Elites CAN shoot the hotter 10mm."
Gunsforsale,32i95c,the_nerdster,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm the seller haha. I've only shot like 80 reman rounds from lax through it.  Before I owned it, it was a closet queen and the guy who owned it just gave a few guns to me to make some room"
Gunsforsale,32i95c,NoSuddenMoves,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh I've totally misunderstood the situation then. I'd stick to $50 short of the average auction price and see if you can ""bait"" people into thinking you've got a better deal because they save $50."
Gunsforsale,32i95c,daz123,-1,Tue Apr 14 15:31:45 2015 UTC,Gunbroker fee is anywhere between 10-20% so most items sold there are priced accordingly.  There's also a reason those guns haven't sold at those prices and are still available.  There's a seller at my local gun show that's had the same delta elite on his table for five years because he's sticking to his $900 price.
Gunsforsale,32i95c,NoSuddenMoves,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"I had one of these of the same vintage as a work gun and it was the most disappointing experience with a gun l have ever had and that is with going through the SIG flaking coating fiasco,if you were buying it as a shooter no more than $400."

Also, it is a little bit of a deal on the scope, but it is used/bubba'd, and it is not that awesome of a scope. Duracote subtracts value from things, not the other way around. This sounds like the seller is pretty high, extremely high if the rifle has been fired."

Gunsforsale,32c0zq,Brute1100,3,Sun Apr 12 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"Because of the duracoat job and the fact that the rifle has most likely been shot a bit I would offer him $750 for the whole package, maybe $800 if I were feeling generous.

The markings on this one are in fantastic shape, and there is a big collectors market for these girls. I personally wouldn't pay over $500, but the right collector may pay $600 easy. We sold one (in MA) for about $500 a few months ago, and it was not as nice. The one you linked to does appear to have some damage to the wood, and some stock splitting. If you are looking for a shooter, you may be able to find something with worse metal but nicer wood in the $350-$450 range. Awesome guns either way, you will not be disappointed."

Gunsforsale,328y1k,BDTack,2,Sat Apr 11 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"Could we get a picture of the glass? Usually on clones they are pretty hazy and fov isnt great, but curious to see how yours look."
Gunsforsale,328y1k,ChuckieC,2,Mon Apr 13 21:58:24 2015 UTC,What kind of battery does it take? Does it use standard ACOG mounts? What's the warranty/where can I read reviews?
Gunsforsale,328y1k,OldRemington,3,Sat Apr 11 23:42:24 2015 UTC,Fiber optics don't need batteries.  Unless I've misunderstood the ad.
Gunsforsale,328y1k,fireh0use,2,Sun Apr 12 03:40:14 2015 UTC,fireh0use... the fiber optic rod works without battery's correct. The thing is there is a battery cap that accepts 2 small button battery's. Once the battery's are installed and the switch is turned to on it will power the reticle from the battery's (if your in a dark room/low light area where the fiber optics can't gather enough light).  So the battery's really just works as a backup power source. When the battery's are installed the reticle is good to go despite outside lighting.
Gunsforsale,328y1k,MK12Mod0SuperSoaker,2,Sun Apr 12 13:29:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks Rem for your question!   They accept (2) 393/LR754 small button battery's. However battery's do NOT need to be in the unit for it to function (the fiber will keep you A-1 unless there are crazy amounts of ambient lighting.)    I have not tried to mount them on any other ACOG mounts, but I am almost certain they should be compatible.  The warranty comes from me... I guarantee you if you are not satisfied you may return it for a full refund. I stand by everything I sell. You can check my Gunbroker feedback (which I am very proud of.) listed below. I am also the owner, and sole operator of www.thesightguy.com   http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewUserFeedback.aspx?User=2467676  Thanks for the questions Rem!

Gunsforsale,326zz3,DrFrankenweiner,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:53:22 2015 UTC,Is it a fixed choke or interchangeable?
Gunsforsale,326zz3,George_Hayduke,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:30:31 2015 UTC,"Threaded for chokes? You could get about $450 out of the right customer. Realistically you will probably get $350-$400 in most markets. If it is not threaded for chokes, or if the engraving/inlay is boogered the value will drop substantially."

Gunsforsale,324yaw,livinglifelazily,3,Fri Apr 10 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Love that scope.  Know a lot of guys around here in N. Texas who are serious long range/tactical marksmen who favor that scope.  I've got a couple of USOptics scopes and one of this one's little brother's (or maybe a cousin it's a 2.5-10X Vortex) and if I was a bit more flush right now I'd love to make you an offer on this scope for my currently naked .300 WinMag.    Good luck selling it, and if anyone's interested in a serious big boy (or girl, we don't discriminate) scope well below retail price, and have the cash laying around, this would be a very good way to spend your money."
Gunsforsale,324yaw,WhatDoesN00bMean,2,Sat Apr 11 11:53:02 2015 UTC,it's been an amazing scope and I wish I didn't have to sell it. the first time I shot at 600 yards (which was also the first time I shot anything farther than 100 yards) I was on target within 3 shots. my rifle plus this scope equals unfair advantage.

Gunsforsale,31yww1,SuperSix-Four,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:35:40 2015 UTC,That's probably pretty close with holsters. How many mags? That's a big selling point on those since they are $40 a pop.
Gunsforsale,31yww1,Otb22,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:11:21 2015 UTC,I paid $375 + $17 for a two tone .40 and $350 + $17 for a black 9mm shipped from PSA a few months back.

I'd say pass and build your own if you plan on changing out any of the major components such as the optic, handguard, or stock.  The BCG is a pretty cheap one and if it were my rifle I'd want to swap in something better eventually.  Don't give too much thought to stiff takedown pins, they are a pretty minor concern unless you plan on swapping from your 6.5 Grendel Overwatch DMR upper to your suppressed 10.5"" 5.56 CQB upper mid-rappel from your squad's CH-53 Chinook transport helo while using your baby Glock backup pistol in .357 Sig to shoot the enemy sniper's .338 Lapua rounds out of the air.

Gunsforsale,31s2j5,Fuck_Me_If_Im_Wrong_,2,Tue Apr 7 18:51:35 2015 UTC,Someone who knows their stuff should chime in soon.  I'm thinking its a bit high for a miss matched Mauser.  Is it an original sling and cleaning rod?    Its not a Russian capture which makes it more desirable.  I'm assuming its the original bluing and wood finish.  Russian captures are typically selling for 450 or so right now.  650 may not be too bad but I don't know for sure.
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,paint3all,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:05:29 2015 UTC,"He doesn't know if the sling is original or not. And I haven't asked about the cleaning rod, I will now"
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,Gewehr43,2,Tue Apr 7 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty rough for $650.  I'd look elsewhere.  Plus, his pics suck and make it tough to tell you exactly what may or may not be wrong with it."
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,dirty530,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"Do you know it's actually An original German? If not ask for pictures of the markings  Edit: didnt see the pictures on mobile, markings are there."
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,Gewehr43,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:47:59 2015 UTC,It's definitely an original German K98k Mauser.  What happened to it after it left Germany's care is anyone's guess.
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,dirty530,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:05:28 2015 UTC,Good point. Does it make a difference if it is/was a non capture?
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,Oberschutze,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"The fact that the waffenamt markings are there is good, but overall I'd say you're being taken for a ride. Maybe they're just getting that expensive now, but I really wouldn't pay that much. Maybe around $400 would be more reasonable? It's a nice piece, don't get me wrong. I just have a hard time seeing believing you still can't find one for cheaper."
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,kaiserwilly,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"Most of the German K98ks that I've seen sell for $450-550. It's not a bad gun, but it's not super nice either. I'd say it looks to be in good condition overall (assuming the rifling is in good shape--that's an important detail I haven't seen anyone discussing).  The price is definitely going up. Three years ago I missed the opportunity to buy a K98k for $300 and I've regretted it ever since. (Not that I had the money due to school).   I mean, I'd say $500 would be fair for it if the rifling is good. It's import marked and mismatched, and the metal has seen better days. The wood also looks a little dark, and I couldn't really see, but it appeared that there was a tiny crack by where the bolt travels rearward.  Another thing that's in its favor is that it's early war production, so the quality will be (or should be) better than something made in 1944 and later (these guns typically are nowhere near the same quality). I also could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it should have a front sight hood, which appears to be missing.   Also, do you know if it was counterbored? I haven't heard as much about K98ks being counterbored (unlike Mosins), but in theory, if it has been, that would reduce the value as well. If it's import marked, I would assume there is a chance it might have been.   I think this is guy is overcharging though. for a mismatch, $650 would be fair if it were in really nice shape, but I know for a fact you can do better elsewhere. I've been in the market for a German K98k for a while now, so I've been looking at a lot of them, and this isn't really a good deal.  If you can beat him down to $400, take it, I'd say $500 might be decent, but $650 is WAY too high.  If you really want a K98k and aren't into a collector's piece, look for a Sporterized one that still has the waffen marks on it (It's more common than you'd think). Then just buy an original stock. You'd end up being in good shape then, and likely will save a lot of money as long as the barrel hasn't been cut.   If you have any other questions, let me know. I'm a Mauser Junkie, so I'll help in whatever way I can."
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,kaiserwilly,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"I should mention, when I say good condition, I mean there's no glaring issues from what I see.  though the wood looks a little sketchy."
Gunsforsale,31s2j5,zZ_Mr_Hanky_Zz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:44:42 2015 UTC,To be honest that K98 is in poor condition. Even if its not a RC (Russian Capture) its not worth $650. Mint 100% matching Mausers can be around $2000. Once even a single part is replaced and it is no longer matching the price plummets. This gun is worth probably $300-400 depending on barrel condition. Again Mausers lose their value when they have either had parts swapped or they are neglected as is this case.
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,Fuck_Me_If_Im_Wrong_,5,Tue Apr 7 18:06:44 2015 UTC,"Overpriced. You can get a 40's Nagant with a shiny bore for $150-200 easily. It will come with the holster, cleaning stick, and screwdriver tool. Six boxes of ammo (84rd) is worth perhaps $35.  Snap caps are inert dummy rounds, usually made of plastic or wood. You can find a pack of 32 H&R snap caps (roughly the same dimensions as 7.62x38) for $15-20 online."
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,Szalkow,2,Tue Apr 7 18:17:34 2015 UTC,Where? Which online suppliers has them that cheap? They're not on Buds or AIM. The last ones AIM got in went for $220 and sold out quickly. Any local shop is charging out the ass for them. They're auctioning for $250+ on gunbroker.
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,tbmcrowley,2,Wed Apr 8 01:17:40 2015 UTC,I would also like to know this.
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,DonVito1950,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:13:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. Don't want to spend an extra $75 for bubba snap caps and cheap bullets. Is there anything wrong with a frosted barrel? Does it still shoot fine and everything?
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,Szalkow,2,Tue Apr 7 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"As long as the rifling is still sharp and there's no major pitting, a frosted bore will continue to shoot well. However, the rougher finish will dirty much quicker and takes longer to clean thoroughly."
Gunsforsale,31rvyz,Szalkow,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:50:14 2015 UTC,Ok so I'm just going to avoid it then. I've read you can shoot a few hindered rounds through it and it will clean up the frosting but I'm not sure how accurate that is

Gunsforsale,31jlv1,NoGodNoProblem44,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"Not really. 200-300-300 plus or minus fifty bucks per gun, depending on condition and local market, and maybe on  accessories included."

Gunsforsale,31i0bb,turn_down_for_hwhut,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:50:44 2015 UTC,350- 400
Gunsforsale,31i0bb,silicondioxides,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:07:02 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to go up to $500 if it was in really good condition.  Even run of the mill Norincos and Yugos are selling in the $300 range.  Russians are much rarer.
Gunsforsale,31i0bb,Bartman383,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah the guy wants $450 which seems about right but doesn't want to do cash, only trade so it looks to be a no go."

Gunsforsale,31gr7m,the_nerdster,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"If you mean can you just put this upper on a regular 5.56 AR lower, then yes. For your other question, no it does not come with a front sight. I used an eotech on it the few times I used it. I'm only getting rid of it because I have to pa some taxes. I also plan on building a .300 blk pistol or sbr at some point."
Gunsforsale,31gr7m,the_nerdster,0,Sun Apr 5 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. Unfortunately the tax man also comes here, and I'm pretty strapped for spare change at the moment.   Good luck with the pistol build though, they're a ton of fun."
Gunsforsale,31gr7m,the_nerdster,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:59:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm really looking forward to it.
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,SubSonicTheHedgehog,2,Sat Apr 4 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"If you're going to have it Cerakoted that will probably run you another $120 minimum. So that puts it up to around $459. Now here's my question: For around $250 more you could get a brand new already Cerakoted Lionheart LH9 pistol which is pretty much exactly the same as the Daewoo. With that in mind, would you rather buy a new gun or a used gun?"
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,Dan_Backslide,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:29:11 2015 UTC,Now add that $120 to it still.  Also more interested in the Daewoo rollmarked one.
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,Dan_Backslide,3,Sat Apr 4 22:13:07 2015 UTC,Uhh the LH9 comes Cerakoted. That's why I suggest it in the first place.
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,Dan_Backslide,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"Comes in the color they cerakote, I don't get to pick any color from the rainbow...."
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,diagela,2,Sun Apr 5 18:02:16 2015 UTC,Well youdidn't specify that you wanted it in your particular color. That bit of information would have been useful to know. Then by all means get the daewoo at the pawn shop and have it done.
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,diagela,2,Sun Apr 5 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"meh, Bud's had a used one for just under $300 a while back, that was probably in better condition than the one you are looking at. I wouldn't give over $300 for it."
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,NWPatriot71,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say pretty similar condition, other than those spots on the trigger guard.  Which if I weren't looking to coat it no matter what would bother me."
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,22lrHoarder,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen either gun in person, I'm just going off the photo at Buds and their claim of it being 90-100% condition. If you think the one you looked at is in better condition, or if it comes with more than one magazine, it might be wroth what they are asking."
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,emjayt,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"The Lionheart LH9, is a rebadged DP51. For $300, you would get a really good deal on a really nice da/sa automatic."
Gunsforsale,31ftwo,Kilo__,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:34:37 2015 UTC,I picked up a near mint one two summers ago for $200. They seem to be going for around $225-250 used.

Be smart about it and onceyou find proper alignment, use a carbide drill bit, dimple the barrel, and red loctite that shit in place properly.  Or get it pinned."
Gunsforsale,31ckw0,Sit-Rep,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Yup its pretty easy to do.  I never got to that stage, only lightly screwed in the two gas block screws, but dimpling the barrel is recommended if you're going to be heavily using your ar15.  Here's a YouTube video that shows how easy it would be : https://youtu.be/NufnAnjxQlE"
Gunsforsale,31ckw0,bacon_strips,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:21:35 2015 UTC,I'll do $120 plus whatever shipping will be.
Gunsforsale,31ckw0,bacon_strips,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:05:10 2015 UTC,This is a never-used barrel that goes for $195 + shipping new. Am willing to deal but make a reasonable offer
Gunsforsale,31ckw0,sirJ69,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"I understand. $120 is just low enough for my poor ass to bite, so I threw out an offer to see what would happen. I mean no offense, honest, but I will maintain my offer."
Gunsforsale,31a2j8,scottie241,2,Fri Apr 3 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"As long as the stock is all there that is probably what its worth. Is the bayo lug and pin slot still intact? If so, you can buy this and all the parts to return it to original condition and still come out ahead on the going price."
Gunsforsale,31a2j8,cybelorian,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:51:25 2015 UTC,Like do you mean the two flanges or whatever that stick down to attach the bayonet? Because if so those are all gone.
Gunsforsale,31a2j8,PsymonRED,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:58:28 2015 UTC,That will hurt what it's worth.  This might be a parts gun for a tacticool sks
Gunsforsale,31a2j8,csc8569,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:11:08 2015 UTC,Everything thing is there besides the neutered bayonet. The stock is in good shape and the I checked the bore and it was nice and shiny. I saw no rust on the gun or putting anywhere. I guess it comes down to how much the bayonet is worth to me.
Gunsforsale,31a2j8,kaiserwilly,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:05:00 2015 UTC,Walk. There is a place online that has them 299.  I can't remember where
Gunsforsale,319csp,carmicdy,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"More and better pics of the the various parts will give us a better idea on the collectability of this one in particular.   Other than that, I would say the difference between 43' and 45 are somewhat important even in a tula. Post war will have evidence of better machine work and finish in my experience.  Other than that, check the crown and see if its been counterbored. If it comes with all the usual goodies I'd say its a decent deal, if its just the gun I would not bother."
Gunsforsale,319csp,cybelorian,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"https://imgur.com/AkcGtRo,rP4QDbb,pLfGXte,18BlZgL#3  Few more he sent, he has the bayonet and a few pouches, stock looks a little dinged to me but since I'm picking up an Izhevsk I figured it would be fun to have a Tula as well.   **Can you expand on the counterbore? Newish to rifles."
Gunsforsale,319csp,TheTimeTortoise,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"Often the rifling near the muzzle gets damaged by years of wear or improper cleaning, and because of the way the bayonets attach, it would be necessary to mill out the last couple inches of the barrel so the bullet doesn't get screwed up by the rifling at the end. It looks like this  *some mosins end up more accurate after a counterbore, many avoid it because it is a possible indicator that a previous owner may have given it improper cleaning and other maintenance"
Gunsforsale,319csp,ToddG2,0,Fri Apr 3 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"They did not ""mill out the last couple inches"". Couterboring did not change the length of the rifle. They ground down a few mm of the muzzle end of the rifling with a conical tool, causing the bullet to stop engaging the rifling slightly sooner. Yes, it was to improve accuracy either during arsenal rebuild or sometimes out of the factory. I have both styles and have yet to see any actual difference in accuracy. The best way to tell is stick a bullet in the end. If it goes in straight and locks up not to far in, no CB. If it goes in a bit further and can be tilted a bit before locking up, CB. Not a huge difference but some prefer non-CB."
Gunsforsale,319csp,TheTimeTortoise,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:28:41 2015 UTC,Well TIL
Gunsforsale,319csp,TheTimeTortoise,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"It looks good, the stock looks a little worn, but as long as there are no cracks or whatever it should be fine. I paid $140 last week for a 1942 Izhevsk in about the same condition, so if it is a tula and you're getting all of those extra parts, $200 seems reasonable."
