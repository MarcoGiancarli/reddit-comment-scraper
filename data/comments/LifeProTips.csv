LifeProTips,3dxs18,fa2f,677,Mon Jul 20 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"This only works if the PDF is already text searchable. If the PDF is an image of text, say from something that has been scanned, then word just loads the images onto a word page. Still possibly helpful, but not something that you can edit."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,Nezerin,469,Mon Jul 20 14:29:57 2015 UTC,"People may be interested to know that there are plenty of free OCR websites (Optical Character Recognition) that will convert your PDF ""image"" into actual, editable text.  We use them in work all the time because our scanners only create pdfs, jpegs or tiffs.  Edit: Glad people found this tip helpful! Just wanted to add a couple of things:   Regarding privacy, many of the websites state in their Privacy Policy/Term & Conditions/FAQ whether or not they store your documents, and for how long.  Certainly look into them before uploading anything with confidential info. Some things might be worth retyping just to err on the side of caution! For those asking what scanners we use, they are big Savin multi-function copy machines. There are some machines with OCR-scan capabilities, but we don't have them and this is a quick & easy alternative for us. As some mentioned, you can also upload the pdf to Google Drive and then open it with Google Docs, but I've had much worse luck maintaining formatting that way.   2nd Edit: There are certainly limitations to the services since they are free, so in that sense it's not all that great for bulky scans. I generally use OnlineOCR, which has a limit of 15 pages/hour as a guest user, or Free Online OCR, which will limit your free conversion to 10 pages. Still, they may occasionally come in handy if you occasionally need to convert a couple of pages."

After 5 years people still hit cntrl+p from the browser to print and then call me ranting and raving that ""it's broken again"".

Can you buy better printers or use an intermediate print server?  Maybe not ""you"" specifically since you just support it...but I can see lots of people being unhappy that the ingrained keyboard shortcut doesn't work.  What's next?  Create some messed up copy/paste that only works with a special button?

Every browser based application requires a document to be exported in a different container (99% of the time that's pdf or xps) before it's printed properly (with correct formatting, kerning, etc).  It's not a ""fix"" ....it's the way it is.  You couldn't rebind the keys without destroying the shortcuts in non web based applications and getting a ""better"" printer doesn't magically make the browser format correctly.   Maybe this will help demonstrate what I am talking about.  Go to gmail.  Open an email you want to print and then push cntrl-p.  Does it print the email nice and neat for you?  No, it gives you what the browser captured, which includes the menus, url and pages might be missing because they weren't expanded.  Now go push the print all button google includes at the top of an open email.  Notice how it exports it and then opens up a print dialogue asking to print the exported container file or if you want to save it as pdf or xps.    I guess that button is just a half-assed fix from google though and I should really just rebind cntrl-p so I can print emails through google's ""alternative"" print function."

LifeProTips,3dxs18,polynomialpusher,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:21 2015 UTC,"IT guy here. PDF files were designed as a way to make sure documents displayed the same way everywhere: on your screen, your printer, etc. The format does this amazingly well.  However, there are tradeoffs. Have you ever tried to zoom into a PDF on your phone? It just magnifies the document as if it were a physical object, forcing you to scroll left and right to read each line of text. That's because the PDF doesn't contain the information necessary to reflow the text since it was designed to make documents look exactly the same regardless of the device you use to view them. This is one problem for editors among many others. The end result is that when you try to edit a PDF, it ends up looking garbled to a greater or lesser degree.  So, what can you do?  Find the original. Nobody ever creates documents directly as PDF files. They always create the document in Word or Publisher or Libreoffice and then convert it to PDF when they're done.   If you can't find the original, then try a converter. There's the one built into Word, but Adobe Acrobat also has one, and there are some free ones online. Be prepared for bad results that you'll have to clean up manually.  If the results of automatic conversion are unsalvageable, you will have to retype the document."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,goatcoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:03 2015 UTC,Find the original. Nobody ever creates documents directly as PDF files. They always create the document in Word or Publisher or Libreoffice and then convert it to PDF when they're done.   Have you heard about LaTeX?

LifeProTips,3dxs18,r4nd0md0od,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"IT guy here. Nobody ever creates documents directly as PDF files.   Some people do. There are lots of situations where LaTeX is superior to MS Office or LibreOffice.  Of course it can be a little fuzzy, but in most situations the result is way different.   I'm not a LaTeX ""fangay"", I use both LaTeX and Office, but the possibilities in LaTeX are basically infinite."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,melitonz,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Even in that case, you're not editing the PDF file directly. You're making changes to the .tex file and compiling it to PDF when you want to see the results."

It's that the PDF doesn't contain information about when to join adjacent lines or how to reflow text around graphics the way an ePub does, or a web site with CSS. As a result, the software will inevitably sometimes join lines it shouldn't. Also, text inside images or tables may be hard for that program to handle."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,goatcoat,3,Mon Jul 20 21:26:03 2015 UTC,Misuse of PDFs infuriates me. So many things are PDF that have no reason to be. It's a printed document format being used for things that never get printed.
LifeProTips,3dxs18,crypticgeek,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in a print center, it's disuse of PDFs that bothers me.  If you've got some kooky font you got off the internet in your document, please convert it to PDF before you take it to get printed.  If the way your document is paginated is really important to you, convert it to PDF before you bring it in.  You can bring the original file too, but if you don't need to make any changes before printing, PDF is the painless way.  Basically if you're doing any printing, keep the editable original for your own purposes but bring the PDF if you're printing it from another computer."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,skjenolc,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:57 2015 UTC,A properly crafted PDF is great for distribution of documents for print no denying that.

LifeProTips,3dxs18,HadiDev,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"PDF is not a print format. The format exists to allow documents to be shared and read without dependencies on particular platforms or clients. That's all. PDFs can, and often do, include all kinds of interactive elements, such as hyperlinks, rollovers, popups, and embedded video and flash. They can also be created to fit a 16:9 display just as easily as an 8.5x11 page.  You seem to be arguing that everyone needing to include interactive content should just write web markup for it, which is never going to happen. PDFs allow people with no development capabilities to include interactive content."

LifeProTips,3dxs18,kellyj6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"You can actually open and edit PDFs even if they are not searchable.  if you created the file in libreoffice, and selected ""embed ODF"".  It's actually quite handy for a lot of office documents. You can write a report and have it as PDF so that it can be read anywhere, but people can still alter them if they need to. And there's just one file."
LifeProTips,3dxs18,AkirIkasu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:31 2015 UTC,I think e.g. would be more appropriate here since Word-generated PDFs are just one example of PDFs with searchable text. Another example would be LaTeX-generated PDFs.

I found a really cool technique to move more than double the speed safely. You use the crutch, plant the foot down then hop with the same foot twice (ofc same foot) and then crutch again. So you are using your leg 2 times for every one time u crutch. i could travel at around 7-8 mph instead of the normal slow way.   It is pretty hard to explain with text, so just be careful if you are going to try it. If you need help just ask ;) it is pretty fun!"

Back in my teenage years I broke quite a few bones, so I eventually got creative with the casts.  one wrist cast I painted black and covered in 1/4"" spikes (actually bolted them through, too - it was a serious weapon, school was not amused)  and bolted through a metal bottle-opener.  Another was a full armpit-to-fingertips cast that I added some green paint and a foam rubber hulk hand to, and had one big hulk arm for a few months.  I had the same full cast on the other arm a year later, and used 'bumper chrome' spray paint to turn it into a biotech metal arm, ala Jax from Mortal Kombat..

Ibroke my kneecap and painted that one to look like a big tree stump, with wood grain and knots and all.  that one I think looked the most ""odd"" and got looks from lots of people. it looked like I had a serious log attached at the hip.  The first few were just boring stuff like signatures, checkers or flames (it was the '90's, after all)  but after 3 or 4 casts in a row, they start to feel like a part of you and need personalizing :)"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,marlow6686,8,Sun Jul 19 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"I used crutches for 8 months (I'm on a cane now), so I'll jump in with extra tips.  The tips of the armpit cushions should NEVER touch your actual armpits. It should be (while tucked under your arms) approximately 2 fingers lower than the pit.  Don't lean against the crutches with your armpits. You can cause irreversible nerve damage, and it also creates bad posture.  If you carry purses, or even this water bottle tip, be very careful. Your balance is already going to be messed up. I recommend a backpack because the weight is even.  Grocery shopping will 100% suck. Bring a friend to push a trolley, and if you can't, ask for a scooter. Otherwise, it'll look like you're stealing.  Don't look down while walking. Look forwards, keeping your shoulders straight. This will help your balance, and prevent bad posture/pain.  Ask your doctor if you're partial or no weight bearing. Towards the end, I could walk with both feet with crutch assistance. This will also help atrophied muscles.  If you're using crutches for a long time, your muscles may atrophy. Just be aware of this. You might want to look into physiotherapy if your insurance covers it. It will help you return to normal as fast as you can.  That's all I can think about now. If anyone has questions, please ask me!"

I used to have to walk a mile on crutches every day for two weeks and I was so sore and tired from that and a backpack alone.  How do you walk around when the crutches are not balanced in weight?

LifeProTips,3duv5u,OldSchoolRPGs,5,Mon Jul 20 03:00:23 2015 UTC,I i've had eight major knee surgeries and spent the better part of 10 years on crutches here's what I learned  number one if you know you're gonna be on crutches build up your arm strength before hand as much as you possibly can my arms hurt so bad from being on crutches during the first week I could barely get around it was mostly because my arm strength just wasn't there number to wear combat boots on your non-walking foot.  Your body is going to be out of alignment as one hip will be higher from the other for a while     if you're just a tiny bit taller on the other foot it's going to save you a ton of effort and make crunching around a heck of a lot more comfortable  I second the water holder idea but honestly a small backpack was good for me. Wear the backpack in front as it helps with balance   number four get a stool for your shower so you don't have to slide in and out of the bath which can be cumbersome ----and that way you can stick your leg or foot out of the shower and get yourself actually clean !
LifeProTips,3duv5u,econophile3000,5,Sun Jul 19 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. I wear a cross-body purse and carry around a nalgene bottle if I'm just going short distances.  If you know you're going to be on crutches, also clean your house, go grocery shopping, and stock your freezer in advance. Remove any jewelry and nail polish if you're going to be having surgery.  I've been on crutches like 15+ times. I wish I wasn't so good at it."

LifeProTips,3duv5u,guruatma,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:17 2015 UTC,Whoa it's crazy to see other people with tibial plateau fractures! I'm not Big_Lego but I fractured mine about 6 months ago and was told it's a kinda unusual fracture! Still recovering from being immobile in a knee brace for 5 weeks (scar tissue in the joint plus muscle loss) which I'm still going to Physical Therapy for. It's taken longer than I had hoped it would but I don't feel any pain from the actual injury site - just soreness from using my leg again. How are you? How have they laid out recovery for you?
LifeProTips,3duv5u,Trogdor_Burninating,2,Mon Jul 20 04:36:25 2015 UTC,"Shiiit, did you have to get surgery? I broke mine from slipping on a bag in a game of kickball and like hyperextending my leg kind of. The break was a 3mm compression fracture, surgery happens if it's 5mm or more apparently so I didn't need surgery thankfully. Bad news is I've had to wear a brace since it happened for a total of 8 weeks. My leg has already shrunk like half its size which is scary to thing what it'll be in 4 weeks when I can take the brace off. I can finally swing it around without it hurting like a sob but it's still swollen and aches a lot. How did you do yours and how long did you ice it for and all that?"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,just_a_spoonful,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"I fractured mine doing a very similar fall/slide skiing and it was a big enough fracture that I did get the surgery. Still had to be a brace for a while because my doctor wanted the pins to set correctly and it still was pretty painful for a while. And it was still swelling and needing to be iced for at least 3 months. If you haven't seen it already, on my doctor's recommendation we got this ice thing which was super helpful for keeping it cool for as long as possible. For the week after surgery I was going through so much ice the freezer couldn't keep up and we were buying bags from the grocery store!  And for the muscle loss: I know you can't and shouldn't do much with that leg, but I was told to try to rotate and wiggle my foot and toes occasionally while I was just elevating it just to give them a tiny bit of stretching and exercise. It was crazy how fast my muscles forgot what to do. The first few weeks of PT was just re-learning how to activate my quads and glutes. But without any ligament damage I'm very optimistic that this knee will be back to it's old self in another month or two."

LifeProTips,3duv5u,asimplescribe,3,Mon Jul 20 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"Here's an additional LPT (sorry for stealing your thunder, op!) Everyone should use forearm crutches. Underarm crutches hurt, they are hard to maneuver, are heavier, and are hard to steady yourself with, and pads get wet in the rain. Forearm crutches are superior in every aspect, especially for handling stairs, up and down! My ortho has no idea why people use underarm crutches, unless you have a hand, arm, or wrist injury that prevents it. If you can, ask your doc for forearm crutches!"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,xoxoyoyo,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:44 2015 UTC,"lol I did the ""Utility Crutches"" for a while. I never thought of attaching a bicycle water bottle holder, but did use a some crutch pouches. My problem was I would tend to load them up with things I didn't really need so they'd get too heavy and things would end up spilling out when I set them down or they fell over. I've since learned it's better to pack light and don't keep much on my person except my phone, keys, debit card and ID. If I'm going to the gym or need to carry anything more, I'll just throw it in a small knapsack on my back as not to weigh down my crutches or throw off my balance. Or if I'm around people I'm comfortable with and don't care about looking like a weirdo, I can just knot off the bottom of my pantleg and throw secured drinks or whatever else down there lol.   As an amputee and a crutch lifer with no intention of ever going back to a prosthesis, I guess I should probably take this opportunity to share some tips with you all.    Your crutches should be set so your pit pads are a couple inches below your armpits. Extended use and banging against your armpits is known to cause nerve problems. I'll admit, if I'm standing for a long time, I tend to sink into my crutches and rest on my pits. You aren't really supposed to do this. Invest in a small end table or nightstand on wheels. This solves the issue of not being able to carry things to and from the kitchen.  Invest in a laundry hamper on 4 wheels. I specifically mention 4 wheels because most department store varieties are meant to be pulled or pushed at an angle and will only have 2 wheels. I went with an folding steel frame industrial style unit that should last a long time, but there are less expensive nylon and plastic units out there as well. Laundry day used to be the bane of my existence, but this cart has made it a walk, or should I say ""crutch"" lol, in the park. Keep in mind, this only helps if you have a ground level washer and dryer. If you use a laundromat or your machines are located in the basement it wont do you much good. I didn't have my own washer and dryer until recently, so if you're in that situation don't be afraid to plan ahead ask someone for help that day. A rolling basket can still be extremely helpful for you and your assistant in that situation because all they have to do is drop you off and help you load and unload your hamper.  Then they can go about their day while you do your laundry yourself and pick you up as you're getting finished. I would always offer a few dollars or an invitation to dinner for their troubles. Who knows?.. ask that special somebody you have your eye on and you might even be able to score a date out of it lol.  There are a variety of aftermarket pit and grip pads available but if you're a DIYer and want to make your own, here's a few tips. A lot of people like to use terrycloth towels for additional padding. Personally I prefer microfiber because it dries faster if (more like when lol) you perspire and odors don't linger as much. DON'T use tape. The cloth always manages to get loose, then you end up with sticky residue all over your hands. Use some durable thread, ribbon or string. Make sure you measure out and fold your towels to fit properly. Fold the exposed sides of each towel inward so you don't end up with a sloppy look or any unsightly edges. Then wrap the towels around the pads tightly, it can be helpful to use a clothespin to keep them from coming undone while you secure them. Finally secure your plush new pads in place by starting at one end, tightly wrapping your ribbon near the edge of the pad two times, leaving considerable length on either side. Continue by tying the two loose ends together, then wrap end of the ribbon around the pad at an angle in opposite directions forming a diamond pattern. Finally when you reach the other end of the pad double wrap the ribbon like you did when you started and tie it off. I prefer this to easier tape method, not only because it looks better, but because without all the sticky tape residue you can easily cut the ribbon and wash and reuse the towels. Another DIY tip for pit pad covers is cutting the bottoms off of some old sweatpants, turning them inside out and stitching the cut side together. Then flip them right side out and pull them over your pit pads with the elastic side facing down.  When grocery shopping, throw your crutches in the shopping cart and use the cart as a walker on wheels. This is so much easier than trying to crutch and push at the same time. Twice now have I encountered someone with an injured foot/leg at the grocery store trying to crutch and push their cart simultaneously. Both times I could literally see the light bulb above their head when they saw how I was doing it lol. I ran into one of the guys at the checkout line to see he had already adopted my method. We had a brief conversation and he said he'd have never in a million years thought of doing that. He was super cute too, too bad he was wearing a wedding band :( This one is a PRO tip not for beginners or those with poor balance. I take a lot of flack from doctors and amputees alike because I prefer traditional underarm crutches over forearm crutches. One of the biggest reasons I prefer them is because I can stick both crutches under one arm and have both hands free at the same time while still supporting myself. One arm totally free to reach things high up and my supporting arm/hand free at a lower level.  Always try to keep your crutches close. They're your primary mode of transportation. Occasionally at a restaurant, particularly higher end ones, your server or Host/Hostess will ask if you would like them to stow away your crutches while you eat. Politely decline. If you have to use the restroom or worse yet the building catches on fire, the last thing you want to be is dependent on someone delivering you your crutches. For this reason I always request a booth if possible so I can keep them close, without needing to place them on the ground and risk of someone tripping over them.  This is really a personal rule, but I try to store my crutches upright and avoid placing then on the ground. Floors are dirty and germy. Do you really want what you're touching to be touching that? Wash your hands and crutch grips regularly. Your hands touch dirty things, your hands get dirty, your grips get dirty, your hands touch your dirty grips.. Its a vicious cycle lol.  Maybe I'm just a germiphobe, but yeah.. You should really be washing your hands regularly anyways lol.  Avoid revolving doors, especially if you are by yourself. I don't have trouble as long as I'm with someone who can hold my crutches while I hop in and hop out, but remember I'm a pro at this sort of thing lol. I don't recommend trying this unless you're a nimble person and feeling adventurous as it can be rather dangerous. Any building with a revolving door should also have an ADA approved entrance for those of us with disabilities.  Keep an eye on your crutch tips. The second your tips wear through to the metal and you come into contact with a laminate surface, you will eat it big time! I learned this the hard way. There are a variety of aftermarket tips available for different conditions. Extra wide for sand, spiked tips for ice, etc. I've tried a variety of ice tips and to be honest, none thus far have been 100% satisfactory. The ones with a large single spike and cheapo folding ones are way too aggressive for most winter weather, unless you live in Antarctica. So the second you encounter concrete they feel very unbalanced and unstable. The best I've found so far are a black and red pair with multiple small studs in the bottom by Fettermen. But because they fit right over your existing tips instead of retracting like some, they can tend to come loose on occasion. If you're using any kind of ice tips, don't forget to remove, fold or retract them before entering indoors. They will completely destroy floors and again, you will likely eat it.  I learned this the hard way too lol (a few times actually, it's something that's really easy to forget to do).  In addition to ice tips, you may want to look into a studded shoe cover for extra icy weather. Mine looks really dorky so I don't wear it often, but it sure beats slipping.  Here's where I could tell you to get all spiritual and encourage you to embrace nature and the elements.. but nah.. screw that. INVEST IN A FASHIONABLE RAINCOAT!!!.. one with a large hood. When using crutches, you can't hold an umbrella. Sorry Mother Nature, but I'm not going to let you waste the 45 minutes I spent doing my hair and makeup to have me sitting out here looking like a hot mess.  Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for help. I'm talking to all you tough guys in particular. There's no shame in it. Chances are you're injured and it's temporary. The last thing you want to do is aggravate your injury or hurt yourself even worse trying to take on more than you can bare.    As a level 10,000 crutch master, I hope this list is helpful and will make your stay on crutches easier.  I wish OP and anyone else injured who's reading this a speedy recovery. Happy and safe crutching to all my fellow tripods :)    Edit: So I just re-read my post and realized I wrote a novel lol. Do you all think my tips would warrant their own thread? I don't want to clutter the page with two crutches threads, but if they could help people, I'd like to contribute and make sure they don't get lost in this thread. I'm also unsure if it would be a violation of LPT rule #1. Not trying to get banned lol."

LifeProTips,3dxyvb,yeti88,12,Mon Jul 20 13:24:59 2015 UTC,I had similar issues and whined to a friend about it who is a nurse and had some good advice:  The _very_first thing you should do when you wake up is drink a glass of water. Have some water next to your bed so you can drink it first thing in the morning. You may be dehydrated after sleeping and not drinking anything for a few hours  Get an app like SleepBot that monitors your sleep cycles and wakes you up at the end of a full sleep cycle within like half an hour or something before the alarm you've set.   I did those two things and they make such a massive difference.
LifeProTips,3dxyvb,LaLaLalaith,6,Mon Jul 20 15:20:57 2015 UTC,I've had a lot of success with the glass of water in the morning too.    Also try eating an apple... It wakes me up better than coffee.
LifeProTips,3dxyvb,fluentinboredom,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"Just a shot in the dark, but try waking up at 6. Generally peoples full sleep cycles are 3 hours long so you can get 2 rem cycles in without waking halfway through a 3rd when you wake up."

LifeProTips,3dxyvb,Neversaysleep,5,Mon Jul 20 14:15:14 2015 UTC,True 3 hours would be in sync but so would 1.5 hours which is the typical dream cycle.   Many studies have been done on this along with my own experimenting.   1.5 hours will feel better than 2 hours.   6 hours better than 7 etc.

LifeProTips,3dxyvb,SolderBoyWeldEm,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"Try doing as many pushups as you can, until your arms are dead tired.  I know this sounds weird, but it will get your heart pumping and jumpstart your body with a boost of energy. Your arms won't be useless for the rest of the day, in fact I find they recover pretty quickly. But something happens in your body when you do those pushups that makes other less intense physical tasks feel very easy and not so tiring.  Waking up at 6 is also a good recommendation. Sleep cycles are very important!"
LifeProTips,3dwwcp,lnning,22,Mon Jul 20 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"as somebody who's dealt with panic attacks and is a chronic public crier, first ask if it's okay for you to touch/hug them, and try to get them to a more private place if it's in public. Usually it's best not to say anything or try to fix the problem immediately. When the person is still crying, usually saying, ""that really sucks"" is the best way to go if they are talking. Save solutions for a calmer time. Listening and understanding that they're having a rough time is really the best way to go in these situations."

Enduring meaning they are trying not to feel the bad feelings from the trauma, and suffering meaning they feel the feelings and therefore cry. When you experience people crying you are allowed to be physical and comforting, ex hug, patting their back, sit with them in silence. If enduring, they should be left alone until they open up, but it's okay to ask if they need anything."

Lean into them a little to test the waters. Seriously. They might not want to be touched. But if it's all okay, work your way into an embrace.  I honestly recommend saying nothing. Not even ""You'll be okay."" After my brother died died, that annoyed me the most. How the hell do they know whether I'll be ok? The important thing is to be there. Let THEM talk.

Also, if silence is dragging on, I often talk about nothing important just to be communicating and may ask them questions so they have to interact. It depends a bit on the situation as not every response is appropriate. I think the important thing is to acknowledge their feelings and just be with them. Don't say it isn't that bad or it was bound to happen as this is denying their feelings."
LifeProTips,3dxz4h,cmaddog111,10,Mon Jul 20 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"As a borderline extrovert/introvert (I like to believe that I actually can choose between the two, as I score in the middle between the two on tests, leaning slightly towards extrovert but recognize myself better as an introvert), theese are things that works for me:  Don't try to be can extroverted person. That'll make you trying to be something you're not, which probably will make you more uncomfortable and less remarkable.  Being an introvert is not necessarily a disadvantage in social settings. Get to know your qualities and play on them rather than trying to compensate too much. As an introvert you should be more incline to think before you speak and also process what the other person is saying and give a qualitative answer. This is good qualities for a good listener. Extroverted people love good listeners, and so do introverts. Master the skill of being a good listener, ask the correct questions to lead the conversations by directing them where you want them, instead of trying to drag the conversation by being the one who does the talking. This could make you more interresting.  And, a trick that works for me is to remember the names of people I've just met. Most likely people never remember names the first time they meet, and they feel guilty about it. So if you find the right time in a conversation with them where it suits to mention the name of the person you are talking with, they will first of all be positively surprised that you remember their name, but also feel guilty as they feel that they also owe you the courtesy of remembering your name. Such a feeling can trick a person into remembering you because of both that you were the one who took notice and cared about the persons you spoke with, and because they felt bad for not doing the same to you. In short, it makes you look like a better person than them in their eyes."

On this note, I find a good way to be memorable is to pick one or two things about yourself, and play them up; especially in a group where those things are rare.

What I mean is, go beyond the usual small talk (How are you? etc.)  Depending on the situation it can be:   Making a witty remark Asking for something from them (what's your number? can you introduce me to your friend you were just talking to? etc.) Making a genuine compliment tailored to them   Not limited to the above. Basically, you have to stand out - put yourself out there (everyone's special in their own way, so don't be like everyone else). When I go to a party, I usually remember the loud guy(s), the entertainer (some guy who has sick dance moves or sings well), the guy who doesn't give a fuck and does whatever looks fun, the responsible guy (the guy who commands a certain respect, breaks up shit, and makes sure everything's going well), etc."

The best tip that I can give you is to ask good questions.  Take a genuine interest into someone else's life, and they will remember you for that reason.  Try to avoid questions framed around the who, what, where, and when, and try to be more open ended by asking ""Why?"".

LifeProTips,3dsr06,AmishRockstar,843,Sun Jul 19 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"The average person has no frame-of-reference for lumens, it's why CFLs and LEDs still list a prominent ""wattage equivalency"" on their packages.

EDIT:  Lots of replies going on about how stupid people must be for not knowing this:  For decades wattage was an easy, reliable metric when trying to figure out how bright your incandescant bulb would be; I think it's silly to expect those folks to be familiar with technical minutiae that carried little value in their daily life."

LifeProTips,3dsr06,Hass91,9,Sun Jul 19 08:45:03 2015 UTC,"For years it was believed that light was emitted from an electric bulb; recent information has proven otherwise - dark is sucked into the bulb - therefore, the bulb is a dark sucker.  There are many types and sizes of dark suckers. The largest manufacturers of dark suckers are General Electric and Sylvania. Some modern dark suckers utilize solid power to operate properly. Solid power units can be purchased from Eveready, Exide, and Duracell.  The dark sucker theory proves the existence of dark suckers as well as proving that dark is heaver than light.   Some examples are as follows:  Electric bulbs: There is less dark near the electric bulb than at a distance of 100 feet when it is operating; therefore, it is sucking dark and can be classified as a dark sucker. The larger the dark sucker, the greater the distance it can suck dark. The larger the dark sucker the greater its capacity of dark. The dark sucking capabilities are evident when the dark sucker has reached its capacity and will no longer suck dark. At that point you may notice the dark area on the inside portion of the dark sucker. The larger the dark sucker, the larger the area of dark found within. This type of dark sucker can be made directional by placing a shield around a portion of the unit or behind it. This will prevent dark from entering the dark sucker from that side thereby extending the range of the dark sucker on the unprotected/unshielded side.  Candles - primitive dark suckers: There is more dark 30 feet from a lit candle then there is at a distance of 3 feet. Proof of it's dark sucking capabilities is relatively simple. Examine a new unused candle, notice that the center core is not dark. Ignite the center core. Allow the center core to burn for about 5 minutes. Notice the lack of dark around the candle. Extinguish the candle flame. Notice that the center core of the candle is now dark. The center core is a dark sucker protected by a soft insulator to extend it's life expectancy and maintain rigidity to verify that this primitive dark sucker is operating properly. Ignite the center core and allow it to burn for a minimum of 2 minutes. Pass a clean pencil over the top of the flame, left to right, approximately 3 inches above the center core. Notice that there is no dark on the pencil. Pass the pencil over the center core now about 1/2 inch. Notice that the pencil now has a dark area. The pencil blocked the path of the dark being sucked to the core of the dark sucker. This type dark sucker is very primitive and does not suck dark any great distance nor does it have a large capacity.  Dark sucker solid power units may be purchased locally at a variety of outlets. Size does not determine the life expectancy of the dark sucker solid power unit. These solid power units work with many modern dark suckers, and absorb dark from the dark sucker. The absorbed dark is converted to solid power within the unit. An example of the conversion of dark into solid power in the automobile of today. Notice an auto in use during dark hours. Two (possibly four) large dark suckers are located on the front. On the rear there are two (or 3) smaller dark suckers with red filters. You may also notice several dark suckers with yellow filters. These filters are required to remove a percentage of red and yellow from total dark so as to energize the solid power unit. The solid power unit permits the auto to be utilized during hours of no dark by the dark it has absorbed. The number of dark suckers varies with the age of the automobile. Newer automobile solid power units require a greater percentage of red filtered dark. Older units generally require more non-filtered dark. The solid power unit of the automobile has a dark interior. This can be proved by cutting the solid power unit in half.  Dark is heavier than light. Dark always settles to the bottom of a lake and/or river. Submerge just below the surface of a lake and you will notice an absence of dark. Lower yourself to 15 feet below the surface and you will notice a degree of darkness even on a sunny, bright day. Lower yourself to 50 feet (or more) below the surface and you are in total dark. Ergo, the dark has settled to the bottom; therefore, dark is heavier than light. Modern technology has allowed us to utilize the dark that has settled to the bottom of large rivers through the creation of turbines which push the dark downriver to the ocean, which has a larger holding capacity for dark and is a common safe storage location. As the dark is passed through the turbine, a percentage of solid power is removed and transmitted to various short term storage plants for many usages. Prior to turbines, it was much more difficult to move the dark from rivers to storage areas such as deep lakes or the ocean. The Indians would paddle their canoes very little and not very deeply if they were going in the direction of flow of dark so as not to slow it down. However, if they were traveling opposite the natural flow of dark, they would dig their paddles very deep and rapidly to assist the flow of dark to its ocean storage place.  Dark is faster than light. If you would open a drawer very slowly, you will notice that the light goes into the drawer. (You can see this happen.) You cannot see the dark leave the drawer. Continue to open the drawer and light will continue to enter the drawer; however, you will not see any dark leave the drawer. Therefore, dark is faster than light. Go into a closet, close the door, and turn off the dark sucker. Have a friend open the door about 1 inch. Your friend will not see any dark leave the closet, nor will you. Have your friend open the door until half the closet is dark and half is light. Since 2 objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time, and you do not feel any change in pressure, by compressing the dark, it is logical to assume that dark is faster than light.  One last proof.  What is a by-product of movement of dark? Heat. What is a by- product of dark suckers? Heat, again. Therefore a dark sucker generates heat during its operation, sucking dark from the surrounding area."

LifeProTips,3dsr06,kmrst,6,Sun Jul 19 06:46:28 2015 UTC,Is this a candela?
LifeProTips,3dsr06,mister_simon,15,Sun Jul 19 06:38:00 2015 UTC,"Originally, yes.           One candlepower was the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120 grains per hour.          This days the definition is different         The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540Ã1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1â683 watt per steradian.             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela SI history and evolution is fascinating and weird.       Edit: Thanks /u/Phreakiture, didn't noticed"
LifeProTips,3dsr06,ArticLabs,2,Sun Jul 19 08:09:59 2015 UTC,540Ã1012 hertz   540 x 1012 Hz.
LifeProTips,3dsr06,Phreakiture,5,Sun Jul 19 11:08:37 2015 UTC,"Nowadays all the boxes will list lumens on them. As for what they are, they are the total amount of light produced by one candle. (A candela is light in a specific direction, lumens are the total of all candelas produced by the bulb).   The basis isn't too important, though. You just want one in the 600-1000 range for a nice brightness."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,Dirty_Socks,22,Sun Jul 19 11:52:38 2015 UTC,I didn't know about lumens and just bought a lot a lot of light bulbs.   I went by the watts the lamps indicated to use. I thought that more watts meant brighter for incandescent light bulbs. I didn't know that wasn't true for the newer type bulbs. So this is a good LPT for me.
LifeProTips,3dsr06,iberis,17,Sun Jul 19 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"It's true for a lot of folks, but because this is Reddit there's always gonna be that crew that lambastes people for not being familiar with something technical."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,JohnProof,3,Sun Jul 19 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"It generally is still true, just not between different types. A 5W LED will typically be brighter than a 3W LED, but it gives you no idea how that compares to a 60W incandescent."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,justNickoli,10,Sun Jul 19 18:37:10 2015 UTC,I always assumed that the equivalence was related to the bulb applying the correct amount of resistance for the fixture or something safety related like that.
LifeProTips,3dsr06,Sazerac-,3,Sun Jul 19 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"This is also what I thought. Am I mistaken here? If so I'll stop worrying about matching bulbs when I need replacements.  Edit: looked it up. I'm a little mistaken. You still cannot exceed maximum wattage for a fixture, so that's a real thing. But since the new CFL and LED lights run at lower wattage you can get brighter lights both in energy use (Watts) and lighting efficiency (Lumens). So you can increase output which usually increases brightness up to whatever the fixture max is."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,Butt_chugger_X,5,Sun Jul 19 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yea you're mistaken. A bulb that emits 100% in the infrared but at 100 watts would be marketed as a ""100 watt, 0 lumen"" bulb. Lumens is a measure of how much visible light is emitted whereas wattage is the total amount of power it uses. And as far as I know most house circuits are 20 amps (~18 usable), and since most US houses are 120 volts you should be able to run any light that is 2000 watts or less.  LED and CFL bulbs are more efficient because they emit very little infrared, a CFL emits like 99% of its light in the visible, whereas an old 100W incandescent (which is at ~2850 Kelvin) emits 0.003 Joules/cubic meter in the visible, but 0.046 W/cubic meter in the infrared. So an incandescent bulb only emits ~6% of its light in the visible and the rest in infrared -- 96 out of 100 watts of power used in an incandescent is wasted by making light you can't even see."

As you mention, for the first ~50 years of my life, you simply grabbed a 45w bulb to replace a 45w bulb - it fit and it worked.  It's as if the only ice cream flavors you knew were chocolate & vanilla and one day you walk into the ice cream shop in and there are 700 flavors with multiple sub-identifiers and no explanation...there are people waiting in line behind you and you have 15 seconds to order.

LifeProTips,3dsr06,Curiosimo,3,Sun Jul 19 10:40:04 2015 UTC,"Cheaper can be hard to measure, at least around here. The local power company will work with local stores to ""discount"" certain LED bulbs (think instant rebate paid to the store rather than consumer) to encourage adoption/efficiency. So a $6 bulb may not be cheaply made"", just discounted.  As OP said, check the Lumen output, I've seen a lot of variance in what manufacturers consider 60 watt equivalent. I'm also willing to move up a wattage, if the fixture is rated for a 60 Watt bulp, a 75 watt equivalent LED is only pulling 10 watts (wild guess) and well below the fixures rating."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,temp1876,2,Sun Jul 19 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"This is good timing since I just bought 10 bulbs of four different types today. I moved into a new place a few weeks ago and wanted to replace all bulbs with LED ones, matching for color and brightness in each zone. So I did.  One had a small comparison to old watt ratings, but not two, maybe three, of the four types of bulbs.  Two had a whole side dedicated to showing where on the lumen scale these bulbs sit for color and lumen output."

For me...fuck knows and I have far more pressing issues to address in my life right now.  I know roughly how a 60w or a 100w light will perform (or their LED equivalents). I will occasionally look at the efficiency ratings and lumen output but I've no idea if the lumen count is 100 more just how much brighter that actually is.

LifeProTips,3dsr06,TheWarriorDude,11,Sun Jul 19 04:52:39 2015 UTC,In terms of energy costs? I had only CFLs/incandescent in a similarly sized apartment before. My kWh has dropped even though I still used more lights and have probably more A/C use.
LifeProTips,3dsr06,approx-,38,Sun Jul 19 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"Light bulbs account for a generally very small amount of power in the first place, so it is a bit surprising that you saw such a difference."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,JTibbs,6,Sun Jul 19 05:33:26 2015 UTC,Light bulbs are generally between 10-20$ a month in electricity costs for a household.  When I switched to LED my bill dropped 14$ on average
LifeProTips,3dsr06,Nubcake_Jake,2,Sun Jul 19 06:25:44 2015 UTC,That and you rarely have to change them out for new bulbs
LifeProTips,3dsr06,TheWarriorDude,0,Sun Jul 19 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"I never said I saw a huge difference. I implied that it helped (it did.). And I basically had wrung out most things so all that was left was bulbs anyway. However, my other energy use is basically fixed at this point (fridge, fixed number of washer cycles, etc.) At this point outside of A/C use, I have literally no other major places to save energy besides lights or dismantling my entertainment system.   For me the bulbs are also nice because they're dimmable, they last forever, and they have the perfect color temperature. I also prefer that they are instant-on versus CFLs which still had some amount of ""warm-up"" time."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,shevaneltaketwo,9,Sun Jul 19 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"Cfls are really cheap in terms of electric cost and real world usage. A typical Cfl job uses 13w. Electricity usage is measured in Kilowatt-hours. And 1 KwH is about $0.10 where I live in NC. So, say you have 10 CFL bulbs on that is 130w or 0.130Kw. Say you use them 24hrs. That is 3.12KwH per day. Now multiply that by 30 days for your monthly bill and you get 93.6KwH. At the most for those bulbs being on 24/7 would end up costing around $10. Also, the math for one 13w bulb calculates to be around 9.36 KwH per mo if used every minute for 30 days. So about a dollar a bulb is the most. Real world usage scenario will vary from person to person. But yeah, look into big wattage appliances if you really want to save some money.   It can be fun calculating things around your house using that formula. Nearly every electric device had a sticker with the wattage listed somewhere. And if you only see amps, then just multiply it by 110v for a standard outlet and 220v if it's your water heater, dryer, or oven. (They are much bigger plugs). And those 220v use some major wattage."

LifeProTips,3dsr06,2Fab4You,10,Sun Jul 19 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yes you can. Just go to your local hardware store and pick some LED bulbs up. They use the same screw socket as traditional bulbs. And if you're replacing incandescent, you'll see a significant energy savings (70% or so).   Go for the 800 or so lumen ones for most of your needs. Those are bright enough to do work in, the 400 lumen ones are a bit more dim (not bad for a bedroom).   The bulbs aren't cheap ($10-20 each), so you might want to start with just one or two. They work great in bathrooms because they can be switched on and off a bajillion times without caring."

I ran into this exact problem today at the store, I noticed lumens for the first time and was trying to compare LED bulb lumen output to conventional bulbs, and I ended up buying what I was familiar with than trying new tech, because the numbers confused me."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,goodgulfgrayteeth,6,Sun Jul 19 13:40:40 2015 UTC,Well in incandescents it goes like this;  40 watts ~ 450 lumens  60 watts ~ 800 lumens  75 watts ~ 11-1200 lumens  100 watts ~ 1600 lumens  150 watts ~ 2200 lumens  These numbers vary a little by manufacturer but are a pretty close approximation.

LifeProTips,3dsr06,erik__,3,Sun Jul 19 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"Is this really news to people?  This was one of the biggest problems in the early days of CFLs; there were enough of us complaining both Internet and in real life, as well as returning inadequate bulbs, that it was a huge win when the lumens labeling was required.    Apparently one of the tricks was that a ""60w equivalent"" CFL could be one that was closer to 60 than 40, and too many manufacturers thought people would accept that.  Unfortunately there are still specialty bulbs that do not do this- actually last time I had one, the xenon bulb I wanted to replace was the one without the labeling.  The ""equivalent"" LED was clearly marked but I had no reference for whether it would be equivalent.  I didn't need to do it then anyway so didn't bother to look it up."
LifeProTips,3dsr06,yourbrokenoven,3,Sun Jul 19 09:15:26 2015 UTC,It's not a perfect measurement.  LED lights sometimes are more directional so they may light the target better than another light that has higher lumens.  e.g. They might give better street lighting than a higher lumen HPS light that bleeds more light into the sky.

Most people understand that work is the priority if you want to keep your job and maintain the respect if your coworkers. Taking too much time off means that other people have to work to cover your absence ON TOP OF their normal hours. That makes everyone who showed up for their shift have to work harder. I am fully justified in not liking someone who has screwed me over without a second thought. Its really not hard to work around a job. Maybe it means missing that beach trip, but theres no reason you couldnt take time off in advance and give everyone time to figure shit out. I already do my job. Why cant that person do theirs?"

Some managers pay attention to this shit. People who call out are unreliable and dont seem to care about money. People who cover shifts are seen as reliable and hardworking. Cover for them a few times and you get to pull the ""yeah, ive been working a LOT, but i know you guys need me so..."" Next thing you know, you get the money shifts and your asshole coworker quits because they cant make any money on the shifts they're scheduled for."

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,bubblewrappedbull,49,Sat Jul 18 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Well obviously if someone can avoid the hours and get paid they will, but there's another LPT that I heard a while ago: If someone doesn't like you, ask them for a small favour. Firstly it forces interaction - giving them an opportunity for them to bond with you. Secondly, more importantly they're unlikely to refuse and then when they justify doing the favour they'll like you more - because they do favours for people they like. Essentially you've tricked them into acting like they like you and their mind will follow justifying that they must like you because otherwise why didn't they do a favour?    Obviously, don't over-use."

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,rectospinula,7,Sat Jul 18 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Why should they be unlikely to refuse? Peer pressure can make them accept to do a favor but that would not cause bonding, just deepen the dislike."

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,NightGod,7,Sat Jul 18 19:00:41 2015 UTC,I mean the favour should be small - and therefore difficult for them to justify refusing. Asking them a favour that they refuse isn't going to help because it goes the other way and it reinforces dislike.

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Ianallyfisthorses,149,Sun Jul 19 00:13:17 2015 UTC,As a manager I find that you always have people with poor work ethic that want more hours (and thus more money).  So they won't want to give up their days or stay longer but they'll still do a crappy job and want to leave early.  Ideally they are in the process of being replaced but sometimes this can take awhile depending on how many people you have on staff and how good they are.
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,padre-pedro,129,Sat Jul 18 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"When I worked retail, my work ethic took a nosedive when they started cutting my hours and treating me like shit.   When I first started there, I was getting 30 hours a week. I was the only employee in my department, and because of that, I worked my ass off.   Six months after they hired me, corporate instituted a new policy and they hired 4 more people to work alongside me, gave me a host of new responsibilities, and slashed my hours in half. By the time I quit, we were each only getting 8-12 hours a week.   And as it became clear that none of my hard work was being rewarded or even acknowledged, I decided to simply not work as hard."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,thequirkyturkey,43,Sat Jul 18 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'm in that exact situation now, verbatim. Thankfully I just got a new job starting at double what this job will and guaranteed 40 hour work week. It'll be a test of how good my work ethic really is."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,I_FIGHT_BEAR,34,Sat Jul 18 17:10:30 2015 UTC,"Retail used to be a career for some people.  With pensions and benefits, and being treated as a valuable member of the company.    Sears used to have people working in their tool departments that had decades of experience, now I go in there and ask for something like a faucet seat wrench and they have no idea what the fuck it is but sometimes they can search it up on their computer and show me where it is.  Other times they can't do even that."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,metalgoblin,28,Sat Jul 18 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"faucet seat wrench   Great I just goggled a faucet seat wrench.  Then I watch a video on what the hell it's for.  Now I'm thinking about fixing my dripping kitchen sink.  That's the nice part about renting.  You can practice home repair on other people's things.  When you break it beyond repair you call maintenance and go, ""Gosh, the darn thing just stopped working."""
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Calliber50,9,Sat Jul 18 19:41:54 2015 UTC,When was this? I'm 23 so it was most likely before my time. But I'm putting together a home forge so Sears is still the shit for tools. Dat warranty tho!
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,I_FIGHT_BEAR,12,Sat Jul 18 21:04:19 2015 UTC,Up until the early 1990's in my area.  I remember one summer I went into Sears to get some nails for a project and the three or four older guys in a booth lined with binders of manuals and speciality tool catalogs had been replaced with a single teenager and a computer terminal.
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,metalgoblin,24,Sat Jul 18 19:56:32 2015 UTC,I remember asking a friend of mine in IT why people still hire him if everywhere I'll see IT techs admitting 'it's mostly us using google' and he told me 'we know WHAT to google to find our answers. You shouldn't have to constantly reinvent the wheel just to get paid for making a wheel.'
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,I_FIGHT_BEAR,6,Sat Jul 18 20:04:06 2015 UTC,Yep. Low level IT is knowing the basics and knowing how to find (usually via google) and apply information when something out of the ordinary happens.

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Hello_Zech,2,Sat Jul 18 20:03:46 2015 UTC,I work closely with lots of companies in the construction industry.  I have never seen a craftsman tool at a job site.
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,apinc,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:19 2015 UTC,Why is that? Aren't they top of the line?
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,I_FIGHT_BEAR,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"They are not bad tools. I have a few in my toolbox at home that were essentially passed down from my grandfather.  I think it just boils down to convenience. Craftsman is essentially only sold by Sears. They are usually located in malls in suburbia and have only a small selection of tools.  Now compare this to say Home Depot, Lowes, or Grainger. The first two are usually located in strip malls with plenty of parking, have an exponential amount more branches, and sell stuff you would need besides tools (say plywood). So if you need tools instead of making two stops - Sears and Lowes. You would make one stop. Lowes.  Now add in the fact that HD, Lowes, Grainger, etc are very business friendly. Setting up a tax resale account or a commercial account is pretty effortless. Try walking in to sears, tell the cashier put it on my account, and walking out with the merchandise and see how quickly you get arrested. With Home Depot, Grainger, or Lowes, this happens thousands of times a day.   Then there's also the power tools problem. Craftsman may make good hand tools, but you don't see many hand tools at any modern construction site. Almost everything has been replaced with an electric version. Craftsman power tools are GARBAGE.  Here's one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q9cvYJuSW0"

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Simba7,5,Sat Jul 18 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"Fuck, I work in metal fabrication and we deal with companies who are 50% 364 day temp workers on contract for half of what we pay our folks.  By the time they learn how to proficiently operate a machine they are laid off or the contract ends.  So we'll sometimes get two or three good runs from them before wham, back to major problems with delivering on time or within spec.    We farm out some long runs to China once a year, and you have to overorder by 10% or so because there will inevitably be shit out of spec.  To put that into perspective we shipped 30,000 products built fully in house last year under one of our brands specifically marketed as made in the USA and had less than 200 problems come back to customer service.  What pisses me off is that made in the USA doesn't mean what it used to when the workers are treated like shit."

The old, work 40 years at the company you get your first job at and retire, is long gone. Now I'm hard pressed to find anyone working at a place over 5 years unless they just don't have any drive to move onto better things."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Terakahn,2,Sat Jul 18 22:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are overly ambitious about what they are capable of achieving in 40 years of working.  There is something to be said for becoming a master at a skillset, which is becoming more and more rare nowadays.  Partially because almost any problem you run into can be solved by knowing how to Google for the solution, but also that people don't have a solid sense of belonging to any particular job title, let alone a company nowadays."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,metalgoblin,4,Sat Jul 18 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying but here's the thing. I know a fair amount of grandparents who worked within a company, and worked their way up, and their company then gave them a great pension to retire on after 25-30ish years.  Fast forward to today. I know people, mostly co-workers but some friends, who are in their mid-40s or early 50s. There is no way they are ever going to retire. Even if they work til they're 80. The pension the companies offer are not even close to enough unless they take a massive quality of life cut. Like, going from steak to Kraft Dinner every night. It's brutal.   There are obviously exceptions. But it's just not something you can count on anymore. So people end up way better off moving company to company getting raise after raise with each move and trying to save what they can."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,Terakahn,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:56 2015 UTC,The worst is when they have no clue but try to find it on the shelf anyways.  It is awkward to two them nevermind I'll find it myself.

Didnt help that they treated our superb store manager like shit and moved him around alot, while we were left with a string of piss poor trainee managers. Now i work about 12 hours a week (not by choice), and feel hugely under appreciated after all the work i put in that now i dont care....I wont work any harder than i have to now.

Thinking I was setting up another kick ass deal with someone, I said yes.   So when I needed a day off and I asked her to work for me, guess what she said?  That's right, no.  Not because she was busy but because ""she didn't want to.""  Seriously?   So fuck her.  She was always begging me to work her shift for her and I pretty much told her to bite me each time."

What I do is look at who's not scheduled to work that day that has the same job as me, and then go beg those people to trade shifts, take my shift, whatever.     Means less money on my paycheck if they cover the shift rather than trading, but whatever.    Bosses don't care as long as shifts are covered and you let them know about the change.  But a lot of employers keep it under 35 or 40 hours a week because they do not want to be paying anyone overtime, and they're really strict when you start approaching the 40 hour mark."
LifeProTips,3dq0v6,sarautu,13,Sat Jul 18 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"And, depending on where you work, they don't want you getting close to that ""full time"" status because then they have to provide benefits.  If the law states that 40 hours is ""full time"", everyone will be capped at 39 hours."

LifeProTips,3dq0v6,mouse-ion,6,Sat Jul 18 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"So let's say they make a new law: 40 hours is full time, but if they make you work almost 40 hours (say, 36+) they still have to treat you as full-time. The result? Everyone is now capped at 35 hours.  You have to draw a line somewhere, and wherever you draw it, they'll cap hours right below it."

LifeProTips,3dn1pc,jennsnoyl,5,Sat Jul 18 00:06:24 2015 UTC,Sorry but I don't think I've ever seen a paint store that didn't do this.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,_beast__,5,Sat Jul 18 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"Walmart doesn't. Atleast, the one I work at doesn't. It was considered a ""fire hazard"" so they got rid of it."
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,iliketobuildstuff74,11,Sat Jul 18 02:36:59 2015 UTC,Also after you use it once it'll have paint dripping all down the side anyway
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,TheMajorityOpinion,25,Sat Jul 18 00:26:25 2015 UTC,"Handyman here, I do lots of touch up painting with people's old paint cans and end up labeling for them. I always write which room(s) the paint is for on the side of the can and directly under the point where the handles meet the can. 95% of the time, the paint drips down where it is poured, which is at the area where the handles do not attach to the can. Added bonus is that there is usually nothing printed on the label of the can in this location, so there is plenty of blank space for marking. Another handyman observation... Do not depend on the stick on label at the top of the can. It usually fades out after a year or 2 and is useless by them time touch ups are needed."
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,LostxinthexMusic,10,Sat Jul 18 02:24:03 2015 UTC,Put a rubber band across it and tap the brush against that instead of the edges of the can. Problem solved
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,Johjac,9,Sat Jul 18 01:28:37 2015 UTC,That does nothing for pouring the paint into a tray for rollers.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,shieldvexor,8,Sat Jul 18 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Use a nail to pound holes around the deep part of the rim, about 6 holes for a 1 gallon pail. This allows the paint to drain back into the can instead of squirting and dripping when you put the lid back on. When pouring wrap a rag or paper towel around the hand holding the bottom of the can. The mess usually occurs when you tilt the can upright after pouring. The wrapped hand should capture the drips from hitting the can."

LifeProTips,3dn1pc,explainittomeplease,37,Fri Jul 17 20:03:30 2015 UTC,Talk to your landlord.  If you are a long term renter they may even pay for the paint!  If you are short term and can agree on a colour with landlord they might still pay for it!  (Good) landlords love having tenants that care about their living space.

LifeProTips,3dn1pc,MissInTights,11,Fri Jul 17 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"The one downside to just having the swatch is sheen. If you save swatches write the sheen, paint type, and room location on the swatch or on the back."

If you go back to the store ten years later and get a new batch of paint to the exact specifications of the starting paint you will end up with bright (or dark) patches everywhere you try to repaint.  The solution to this is to take in a paint sample off the actual wall and they will match the color as it is, not as it was."
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,enlitenme,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"Actually the best option is adhering to paint formulas. Getting a match is banking on the color matching experience of one guy, on one day, at one paint store. Forever are you his slave, should you need more repair. The formula is always the better option for consistency. Yes, this does mean you will sometimes have to paint an entire wall on very faded paint, but most of the time an untrained eye can't distinguish patches even 5 years apart. Bigger things to worry about for most homeowners are matching texture and matching sheen. These two things will shine like a beacon on your wall."

LifeProTips,3dn1pc,cmgg,5,Fri Jul 17 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"Paint store guy here--  Paint changes every few years.  New colorants show up.  Bases change.  Palettes change.  It's helpful to know which paint you bought, but chances are, it won't touch up 100% after a few years (even if for no other reason than the original coat of paint will have faded and grayed with age).  Chances are you'll end up repainting the whole room anyhow because any new product will stand out against the rest.    My advice: If it's been more than five years since you last painted the room, just repaint the whole thing.  It's good for the walls (keeps your walls conditioned and helps prevent cracking), and it's just something you need to do every so often.  If you're going to repaint it anyhow, then knowing what color won't matter a ton.  Maybe it'll be time to make a change."

LifeProTips,3dn1pc,HoweHaTrick,3,Fri Jul 17 21:55:04 2015 UTC,Well names of paint change all the time . You can always do a color match at the store.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,RhinoWaterFall,3,Fri Jul 17 22:40:32 2015 UTC,Or you can get a permanent marker and just write on the can what room was painted that color. This has worked perfectly for me for the last 10 years.    *Edit: I guess if you finish the last drop of paint and throw the can away this won't work.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,Delicatefukinflower,3,Fri Jul 17 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"Or you could just get a copy of your house plans which have  each of the rooms labelled, take photos of the paint, the colour and the room and save it in a folder with information about your house.   I've got investment properties and have flipped two houses. When I sell, if I need a bargaining chip to throw in I offer up CAD plans of the house, plus detailed photos of the renovation process, including pictures of all wiring and pipes when we're ripped the gyprock (sheetrock I think yanks call it) off before redoing everything.   I've got literal 3D renderings of my places in CAD and kept detailed information about the paint, fittings (handles, hinges, taps etc) and everything else we used specifically for this. I need it for tax reasons but if I sell it I can just give them copies, which has their product codes and names.   I find the wiring diagrams are the most useful. As people don't have to make multiple holes, or spend ages trying to find where the correct wires are to hook up things like internet, power, or the antenna.   Where your water and sewerage lines and access points are a good thing too. If you have a backed up dunny, you want to get to an access point to shove the snake thing down it."
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,RadioIsMyFriend,3,Fri Jul 17 23:53:07 2015 UTC,Sorry if it's already mentioned - I always keep the left over paint.  Put it into a smaller container with as little air in it as possible (big box stores sell small empty paint cans) to keep on hand in the future.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,loogie97,3,Sat Jul 18 00:33:50 2015 UTC,Always found it easier to put some paint on the can and write the room with a sharpie on the can. A lot quicker honestly.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,mdegroat,3,Sat Jul 18 01:11:48 2015 UTC,Another tip when painting is to remove the masking tape right away. Leaving it on and letting the paint dry will cause the tape to peel off more paint than what's masked. Removing it right away will give you a nice clean line.
LifeProTips,3dn1pc,Nervousaboutposting,4,Sat Jul 18 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Paint fades and changes over time.

Be sure to get the base(type of paint) and color (name or number).  This is doubly important with custom color matches. For those you need a VERY clear photo of the entire label.

A predicate nominative looks a lot like the object of a sentence, but it serves to rename the subject. So if you pick up the phone and someone asks ""Is this Bob"" you could reply ""This is he.""   This is a rule that seldom receives emphasis in grammar classes so many people will ""misuse"" the predicate nominative and reply ""That's me!"" Using the object form ""me"" is incorrect according to strict formal rules, but it sounds natural and to a grammarian from a descriptive school of thought (where usage determines rules) that is enough to make it correct.  Probably the best approach when you find yourself in the situation of using a pronoun in the predicate you should stick with the object form (me, him, her, etc) unless you're in a formal setting where strict adherence to grammar rules is required."

He is trying to sound serious, but he ends up sounding like an bumbling middle-manager.  ""Myself"" is a reflective pronoun. It takes the place of ""me"", but only when the subject is ""I"". It makes no sense for him to wash myself. He has to wash me.  This error stems from a prejudice in English to shun the shorter Anglo-Saxon words and to employ the longer French words. (Get it? I should have said ""use""!) ""Myself"" sounds better to the idiot because it is longer than ""me"".  Some of the most powerful language uses short words. ""Never have so many owed so much to so few."" So powerful, yet the average word length is less than four letters."

This is why there is a problem here in the first place. This is an artificial rule that has been injected into their grammar that has only succeeded in causing people to be hypercorrect ""She went with he and I""   It's perfectly okay to speak this way: ""Me and my friend's go out to play"" because there are linguistic principles showing that the default in this case is this form and in some instances is required to not be ungrammatical as in this paper here, on page 10, ""This is the real me, the real me is vulgar"".  When pointing to a picture of yourself you would NEVER say ""That is I""; that sounds ridiculous and ungrammatical no matter how you spin it.

And if the batteries cannot be removed, then the toy is returned to the store from which it came.  There are plenty of instruments in the house. Children can have unlimited playdates with other actual human beings. Children can sing and dance. We have a radio.  I don't need a VTech remote saying in its chipper voice, ""Volume UP! Good job!"" I'd rather be the one congratulating the child for making good choices.

I met this pretty (foreign) girl once, here in Los Angeles. She told me her last name, and it was something typically Greek - like Papadakis. So I very politely asked her if she was Greek.  Man, she just blew her top at me. ""I'M NOT GREEK, I'M MACEDONIAN! HOW DARE YOU CALL ME GREEK!"", etc, etc, etc.  I mean, she really went off - yelling, breathing hard, etc - and it took me a full minute or so to get her to calm down, at which point she sneered at me and stormed off.  So yeah, we do worry about offending people, but sometimes it's justified. I'm a lot more cautious about asking people where they are from since the above incident happened."

LifeProTips,3dp4dz,elementsofevan,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:17:25 2015 UTC,This is correct. But there are two problems here.  Simply carrying the coins is really a problem. It's like asking someone to carry around an extra cell phone or an extra set of keys. It's a real annoyance. It is simply uncomfortable.  The second problem is the way we price things. A soda may be prices at $0.99 but the actual cost after taxes could be $1.08 (or 1.04 or 1.09). A burger may be $4.99 but when you add the 8.75% tax (yes really) it could be 5.43.  So every single freaking cash transaction in America either requires or generates a large amount coin change. And this is probably why people find it so annoying.  Here is just a small sample of the prices I paid for items around the city. Compare that to what you've paid for some items. I'm curious.  14.84 71.67 32.71 38.28 38.05 14.13

I've found that banks will just ask that you preroll the coins as a humane courtesy.   Walking in with a sac of coins is just rude I guess. Be a human while doing business and it will get you far.

Alternatively, if you make a deposit in the night drop, you can put your few coins or ParkinglotPennies into the envelope and it'll be added to your account. Because I'm still paid with a paper paycheck (because I work for a very, very small business and direct deposit fees would hurt them), I make a lot of after-hours deposits to my bank. I just put the check, a deposit slip, and any random ParkinglotPennies or other loose coins that are kicking around my life into an envelope and toss it in the night deposity. And thus, I have converted my metal money into digital plastic card money and can do it 24/7/365.

If too loose, next time make knot closer to the inside of can corner and stretch over corner. I learned this working in the restaurant industry.   Yes, this still works when there are no corners (round can)."

LifeProTips,3dk6qo,478431188447,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:09 2015 UTC,Organizing it like this seems like a complete waste.  It's not like you're going to have more than a handful of parts.  The best tip I know for assembling furniture is to take the allen wrench they give you with it and cut the bent portion off and chuck it in a cordless drill.  If you ever have to put an office together you'll thank me.

I saved the extra hardware that came with it until last month while I was doing some cleaning around the house. I then bought a desk online about a week later. On one of the last steps we realized it was missing parts... the same type of parts I had just thrown away. For sanity purposes, I will now always save the extras, ya never know when you'll need extra hardware, and they barely take up space. Unless.. you know, you have them attached to a huge Styrofoam block. Just store them in a ziplock, and throw them in with your tools."
LifeProTips,3dk6qo,yParticle,11,Fri Jul 17 12:41:08 2015 UTC,"This is underrated.  Ziplock bags are amazing for organizing as you can store a bunch of heterogeneous items together in a small space, but clearly visible when you want something.

It got to the point where my sleep wasn't restful because I'd dream all night about it.   First, I have a physical close-off, where I mentally acknowledge that (in this case, work) is done. For example, purposefully close up your office while dictating in your mind why you are closing up. Shut down computer, ""my tasks for today are complete."" Turn off the light, ""I won't be working until tomorrow/Monday"". Close office door, ""I am done with everything in this office.""  Second, and the thing that saved my sanity, especially in law school, is to engage your mind in something COMPLETELY different from what you do for work. Passivity (watching TV) doesn't work. I read fantasy or sci-fi. At least one chapter, no matter what. I think it's important to get my brain ""looking"" at different things.   Lastly, our brains continue to problem-solve, even when we're not actively seeking the answer. Keep a little notebook around and jot down anything that comes to you that seems important. When you've finished writing, close the notebook, ""I'm done with this thought.""  Some of this is like cognitive behavioural modification. You see the problem, you acknowledge that you see the problem and you move on. By acknowledging and moving on, you may be able to train yourself to not stew on things."
LifeProTips,3dm4o1,mycloudlesssky,3,Fri Jul 17 16:15:31 2015 UTC,When those work-related issues come to mind I would just write them down. It's probably you subconciously thinking that without mentally rehearsing those problems constantly you'll forget them.

I tend to have a lot of projects at once so I keep up with each of them on a big white board.  Under each is everything that I have done or needs to be done for that project.  If my boss puts a deadline on something, that goes on the board.  Otherwise I try to get through it in the order I'm given the work, or sometimes take care of smaller projects because it feels good to get something finished.  Having everything organized in that way and having a basic game plan of how everything needs to get done helps me stress out a lot less when I'm away from work."

Sometimes people with anger issues (which is likely just another way of dating undiagnosed mental health issues) can have their state of mine exacerbated with a public scene. You wouldn't feel too great if you landed your mate in jail for the night because you wanted to discuss the current political climate with him in a library."
LifeProTips,3djztf,j_mcc99,9,Tue Jul 21 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"This can be a very tricky situation - it can work for some people, but very negatively for others. You can't easily predict how people (even without temper issues) will act out in public.  I find a more helpful way of proceeding with these types of people is to try to stay as calm as possible. A key thing here is to also keep your voice as normal and levelled as possible - the moment you increase your volume, most people will mimic you, resulting in continued escalation and state of arousal. Sometimes, you might even want to try decreasing your volume if the person you are talking to is increasing his/her volume.  Try to also have your critical conversations in areas that are familiar and comfortable to the person, to keep them at a more peaceful state."
LifeProTips,3djztf,AluminiumArmor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who suffers with anger management, I can tell you this will have the opposite effect. Most people who get angry easily, like myself, feel freaking out and going over the top is the only way for them to get through to someone. More often than not, the level headed person will be embarrassed and capitulate. Giving them an open, public place only provides a platform for them to flip out and garner even more attention giving them exactly what they wanted. Angry people just want someone to listen to what they have to say before they ever get angry."

LifeProTips,3djztf,nero8600,3,Thu Jul 16 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Even if they create a scene (most won't because, well, they're in public), you're physically safer having a lot of people around when dealing with a person with temper issues than not.  They're witnesses if needed, they can intervene if the other person becomes physical, etc.  Just out of college, I had a boyfriend who liked to shove me when he was angry (and, once, threaten me with a steak knife).  Naturally, I broke up with him.   A couple weeks later he wanted to meet to talk, so I met him in a mall food court.   He said he didn't want to get back together ""as a couple"", but wanted the chance to get together ""as friends"" (i.e. booty calls).   I just told him ""that didn't work for me"" and that it would be best to not see each other in any capacity ever again.   He looked stunned, then started to turn red in the face and clench his fists.   I knew he wanted to push me and shout at me, but felt inhibited because of all the people around us."

Others have no remorse so bringing them to a public place will at the least make no difference and at the worst exacerbate their behaviors. A better idea would be to not be alone in a private place. Like have a couple of friends with you so that there is at least protection in case of violent behavior.
LifeProTips,3djztf,FranticWifey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:06 2015 UTC,Nobody wants to be seen acting out in public.   Then how do you explain the existence of reality TV?
LifeProTips,3djztf,sxzxnnx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how self conscious one is. I am for example very aware of myself being quick to anger, so I can get very uncomfortable when things starts getting heated in public, since I know I can go off the rails in a flash.  But I kinda know when I will get angry and not, and I think my temper issues are shameful. Others might not be so inclined to think about it though. My carefulness is majorly because I'm afraid of causing a scene because I get out of control, so what works for me does not work for an angry person that is a bit more self absorbed and less afraid of others and their opinions."

But I don't get a boss not cutting it down.   the real problem is whichever manager actually scolded the guy for writing a ""snarky"" e-mail. someone in a position of power should know better.    Exactly - that boss sounds like a huge PITA. Or as OP didn't tell anything. (E.g. hi's known for his comments)   but then again, i am not an american, and where i come from we don't try to smile and be friendly all the time.   Me neither.

LifeProTips,3debyt,OmNomSandvich,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:36 2015 UTC,If at least one party knows the call is being recorded then it very specifically is not a wire tap.

LifeProTips,3debyt,birchk1,0,Thu Jul 16 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state.  And it's up-in-the-air what the legality is if they're in another state.  The other party could CLAIM their number was forwarded to Washington, a 2-party consent state, where they answered from.  Good luck proving they were NOT in Washington.  You have little ability to demand their phone records, the burden of proof may be on you to prove they were NOT in Washington."
LifeProTips,3debyt,Oznog99,10,Thu Jul 16 06:37:39 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. The Data Protection Act applies only to businesses. As an individual there is no requirement for consent for call recording. RIPA is relevant for individuals, but that only affects the ability to share the recording with third parties (a court wouldn't count).   Even if it was illegal to record, theres no poison tree doctrine in the UK, so the legality or otherwise of the recording wouldn't affect its admissibility in court if it came to that."
LifeProTips,3debyt,TheDisapprovingBrit,5,Wed Jul 15 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"That what I said. It's legal either way, but using the recording as evidence is technically revealing it to a third party.

Just to confirm our conversation, I will be moving out on July 31st as agreed. Please let me know a convenient time to schedule the damage inspection. I confirm that we agreed you will mail my security deposit within two weeks after I move out to ADDRESS. Thanks for being such a great landlord""  you get the point.   Tape recording the conversation is worse for the following reasons:  -you may be required to inform them you are tape recording, this makes the conversation adversarial.   -communications in writing are better evidence. It's easier to show to a tribunal or court.  -emails also avoids situations where the landlord is just mistaken about what they agreed to.   -you may be required to give notice or communicate in writing under the lease or the law generally depending on where you live. Email defeats the argument that you did not tell them in writing. This may be a flawed argument, but if they think they can get off on this technicality, you now have a headache to deal with.  -if relying on phone call what is to say you didn't have another conversation afterwards in which different agreements are made?   -no worry about evidence getting lost or destroyed."
LifeProTips,3debyt,KINGCOCO,7,Wed Jul 15 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"The one and only thing that stopped all disputes and speculation of he said she said, for me, especially in front of a small claims judge, is to get everything in writing on your lease contract (it's really your one and only official legal document that the 2 of you share and admissible to the judge)  Not going to get new carpet this year? Get it in writing.  Security Deposit not liable for ______? Get it in writing.  Moving out in 60 days? Get it in writing (this means copying the email you sent with the header as well so it shows when you sent it and from where and to who)  Any damages incurred to your residence that didn't occur while you were living there? Take pictures, and then get it in writing.   -On this one, because I failed to get it in writing that I was no responsible for water damage to the ceiling in a corner of a room, and because the landlord ""forgot"" to make a note of it during the move-in inspection, and since a picture of the damage without a time stamp isn't enough to prove it wasn't your fault, I got dinged a couple hundred bucks out of this one.   Unfortunately, the landlord is pretty well legally protected and usually in the right unless you got it in writing or very exceptional circumstances (hence, the contract that you signed is binding). It's a pretty annoying life lesson to learn (a security deposit or a couple hundred bucks isn't going to make or break your bank account) and it's even worse when it's compounded by the fact that there really are bad landlords looking to shaft you."

The last time was later at night outside of the convenience store on the first floor of the building. He was wasted and got really crazy with me and made a vulgar comment about my wife (who works in my office). I admittedly lost my cool somewhat, but the next day, the guy who's twice my size ran to the court house and said I pulled a gun/brass knuckles on him(apparently I'm the fucking Punisher). I was never notified, until after but the Judge granted an emergency OP. It fucked up my state licensing for Public Adjusting job, cost me money with an attorney, I had my Concealed Carry license pulled, and most of all he accomplished what he wanted which was I couldn't come within 300' of my building so I had to hire extra people to run the building for 60 days while waiting for a court date.  I won the eviction first, but he fucked up bc he was talking crazy shit to me via texts for the entire time. Not only displaying his character, his unwillingness to not pay rent for what ended up being 8 months, but the fact that he fabricated the entire situation which was the basis for the OP.

I didn't have access to my checkbook before that, because it wasn't with me in the hospital. And no they don't have direct deposit. This was a few months ago, and the reason I decided to move. No I have never had a late payment before. Also she wasn't the manager when we moved in. The day we moved they fired the old person and hired her.

I moved out (and out of state) before the lease was up, but found someone to sublet. The apartment complex agreed and the sublet person (subletter?) paid all rent to the them directly. Got the whole thing in writing, with signatures from everyone. Except at some point, the sublet guy stopped paying his rent. Fast forward two years and a collections agency calls me up wanting $10k. I call the complex and it turned out ownership had changed. New owner had no record of the sublet agreement. To them, there was just a guy in an apartment not paying any rent, and their documents said it was me. Without my copy of the agreement, I would have been SOL."

From what I've gathered, he got out of prison in 2004 and has since racked up lots of unpaid bills. He's hard to find, but apparently I'm not.

Had a landlord for a short time who didn't bother to disclose the vast presence of mold in the apartment structures. (Moist, cold climate, wooden structures, no heating in the winters at times because he was cheap. Plus the allover neglect over the estate.) We basically got scammed out of our deposit of a months rent. Were only able to inhabit the place for 1,5 months before getting severe symptoms from the mold and were forced to move out. He tried avoiding our letters of termination of the rental agreement for weeks. After that I kept a record of all our transactions over e-mail and MADE him sign an agreement that there was to be no demands from his part to make us pay for damages or extra rent months despite a 12-month initial rent agreement.   Now the bastard has rented that apartment to new tenants. I really feel sorry for them but not much I can do about it.. Fuck those (not all of them) moneygrabbing landlords lacking normal human decency."

There was no vent in my 100 year old bathroom and the mold was over the claw foot tub on 12 foot high ceilings.  When the rental company came for their annual check, they told me to scrub it down with bleach myself.  This was no easy or safe task for me to do and I told them so.  They did nothing.    So I called the health department.  Turns out the Health Dept. shows up real fast, and required THEM to add a vent and clean the mold.  Edit: I'm pretty sure the mold was there before I moved in, just freshly painted over."

I start sneezing uncontrollably if it's broken up and airborne, old stuff. The wetter ""black"" mold gives me puking migraines. Like, screaming ones that make me think I might die. Last apartment I was in where this happened I ended up with two aural migraines a few days apart where I went blind over the course of about 15 minute and, then regained vision after about 20 more. No actual headache from those, which I guess was nice, except for the whole losing-vision part.   I know there's some controversy around types of molds and whether people can actually get sick from them, because in some parts of the U.S., it's everywhere. But my experiences were pretty specific and extremely painful/debilitating/scary. I'm not a hypochondriac. The apartment with the black stuff on the walls was a garden unit that was extremely damp and I used a high-quality dehumidifier like 24/7, which couldn't work hard enough to dry the place out."

LifeProTips,3debyt,aznanimality,4,Wed Jul 15 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"In fairness, though, land lords can be that way because of the way tennants have treated their property in the past. My parents bought a house to rent out (and i have just bought one to rent out aswell) and some of the 'people' that have lived in that house and treated it like shit is unreal. When some of them left my mom was in tears at how the place had been treated, like months of old (used) condoms under beds, broken furniture and marks all over the walls.   Considering the Land lord spent a lot of money on owning the property Tenants sure get a lot of power. But then again my view point is fairly biased.   I also just want to add that I am not condoning bad landlord behavior or that they have a right to be a cock.

LifeProTips,3debyt,pm_me_sth,0,Thu Jul 16 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, all you have to do is submit an itemized list of all the charges that were deducted from their security deposit. You would have to buy a service from say a painting company to repaint the walls, then make sure you attach a copy of the receipt and it's cost into the security deposit return mail. That way, when the tenant receives their deposit back, they know why they were charged. Furthermore, in my state at least, you have to do a walk-through with the tenant before they completely leave the unit, that way you both know what is wrong and write down the issues and then you both sign the document stating that the tenant is aware of these issues and that they will be repaired using money taken from the security deposit."

LifeProTips,3debyt,smashingpunkin,3,Thu Jul 16 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"Same thing goes for anything relating to communications with a gym or internet provider. They will regularly confirm by voice that they have cancelled a subscription, they waived the ""freeze membership"" fee, they don't have cancellation fees if you provided notice (and then they claim you didn't provide the 30 day notice), etc.   I don't know why it's gyms and ISPs, maybe because they just can, but you will always get situations where you are told different things by different reps. The turnover is high too and you will have no recourse if say, the manager at LA fitness told you that your rate would be fixed for 2 year because you purchased the advanced commitment plan, and later you notice it's gone up but he/she's gone (and of course, the contract allows for this loophole).   Not all gyms are like this, but most gyms in my experience have this happen with at least some percentage of their client-bases. They love to let you negotiate a membership deal / package, get you signed up using the promises of waiving X fee and offering Y discount, and then after 3 months you find that they have gone back on their word.   Email + being completely tenacious and willing to raise hell about it is your only way to keep some of these crooks honest. And once again, they are not all crooks, but enough of them are."

Putting everything in writing is so important for every party. I have seen situations in court where there are telephone conversations recorded and it can't be kept on record as evidence because it's not tangible and we can't just keep someone's phone on file. If you are going to present conversations recorded make sure you advise everyone before hand, make copies and even have the telephone conversation in a written transcript by a legitimate transcript service. Don't show up on the day with this surprise substantial evidence.  Having the conversation in a written transcript might seem elaborate but it could make the decision swing in your favour on the balance of probability. It will keep your name of any tenancy blacklist."

Left my last flat in June and my landlord wanted to take Â£380 off my Â£450 deposit to fix damages... These damages? Scratches and scuffs on the walls he said would need to be filled, sanded and re-painted and then that whole section of wall would need to be repainted to make sure sections of wall weren't off colour...  I googled some basic laws for the UK, landlords can't charge for ""basic wear and tear"" and should expect some damages to walls etc that would be associated with people living in the property. Ended up paying him Â£80 for cleaning (I had forgotten to wipe down the cupboards and fridge and a few other bits), but they really will try anything to get more money off you..."

LifeProTips,3ddwmt,Rossoneri,16,Wed Jul 15 20:22:53 2015 UTC,From the ingredients i would guess it changed the consistency to make it more similar and also reduces the massive sweetness that is a container of pure frosting.
LifeProTips,3ddwmt,EldritchCarver,8,Wed Jul 15 21:25:44 2015 UTC,Its base is cake mix instead of frosting.  It's like the difference between eating a small slice of cake versus a big spoonful of frosting.  You can eat a lot more before you'll start feeling sick.

LifeProTips,3dlie9,hi_im_watson,3,Fri Jul 17 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a dog groomer and I encounter this question often. Using an oral or topical treatment such as comfortis, triflexus, advantix or first shield will kill current fleas and prevent future fleas for the time stated on the product. I would recommend bathing your pet to kill the fleas first, with either dawn dish soap and let stay for 15 min or flea shampoo. Then administer the oral pill or wait 24-48 hours to apply a topical, because dogs don't have pores and the medication works with the oils in their hair follicles and will be more efficetive if you allow your pets skin to get moisture back. But it will not eliminate the fleas in your home which can have a three week incubation period. The easiest way to clear your home is with a bomb, such as biospot or sentry. It will tell you the square footage and you can determine how many you will need. If you have grass you'll want to spray your lawn with a treatment as well. But this is usually most necessary in the summer, as fleas breed and thrive in the heat. Diatomaceous earth does work well but you can also use borax salt for your carpet and furniture, it is less expensive and available at Home Depot . Just an FYI, flea collars do not work."

LifeProTips,3dlie9,linnora,6,Fri Jul 17 06:36:16 2015 UTC,"Diatomaceous earth is expensive, heads up.   I used normal table salt to cure my cat's bad case of fleas. I'm sure powdered salt would work the same. What you need to do is sprinkle the salt all over the carpets, don't be too stingy with it, then take a broom or your foot and really brush it in to all the fibers of the carpet. Let the salt sit for about 3 days, vacuum it up real well, then repeat. You need to do this about four times, otherwise you won't kill every cycle of the fleas lives.   I hope I've got the times correct; maybe you should google 'kill fleas with salt' to get clearer directions. Fleas suck, and salt was the only thing that killed 'em in my house. Good luck!"

I don't remember the exact cost, but it probably wasn't more than 20 including S&H.  My (now) husband was paranoid about bringing bed bugs back to his home and bought 50 lbs preemptively.  It was only marginally more expensive than the 10 lbs I bought."

LifeProTips,3dbe3t,nZcastillo,28,Wed Jul 15 03:19:54 2015 UTC,Depends on the quality of the cheese $1000 could get you as little as 20 lbs to as much as 100 or more. On average probably 50-80 lbs.
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,Tkent91,5,Wed Jul 15 03:00:35 2015 UTC,Makes sense really. I get mid grade gouda at 8 bucks for about .3lbs. That works out to about 500 bucks for 20lb. And cheese gets way more expensive than that. So 1000 bucks per 50-80 lb per wheel sounds about right.
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,Sk8_4_Lyf,6,Wed Jul 15 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm no cheese monger either but I'd imagine type of cheese makes a difference since some have to age more than others and aging means time spent on a shelf taking up space.

LifeProTips,3dbe3t,WinterOfFire,20,Wed Jul 15 03:30:42 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to heat them before you eat them. It helps the tortilla hold together. You do it at a higher temperature/longer than flour tortillas. Alternatively, if you're still having problems, stack two tortillas in your comal and heat them. Outside is cooked, inside is kind of corn cakey, and you can load that shit up."
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,perrythebari,7,Wed Jul 15 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"Just adding on to this comment: When the tortilla is heated (assuming you don't have an actual tortilla press), don't just put it into the microwave on a plate.  Wrap it in a dish towel first, in order to steam the tortilla, instead of just cooking it.  30 - 60 seconds is usually all you need.  If the tortilla is steamed, it won't crack and break, and the edges won't get hard and crunchy.  Bonus, if you place cheese on top it and then cover that tortilla with a second tortilla (making it a double decker), then you'll end up with a soft, cheesy and pliable tortilla that you can still wrap around your meat, veggies, etc. without having it break."

LifeProTips,3dbe3t,yodamaster103,164,Wed Jul 15 03:56:04 2015 UTC,You don't use two tortillas because it keeps it together. You use two tortillas because that's how abuelita made them.
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,Wooper160,58,Wed Jul 15 08:45:00 2015 UTC,"Usually the tacos come with so much meat we split the one taco and make two tacos. I'd like to think it was a freebie initially from the taquero.  He would scope up so much meat and throw in a free tortilla so you get two tacos for the price of one.  At least that's my theory.  Edit: why thank you for the gold kind stranger, hope your tacos are extra meaty!"
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,goldishblue,9,Wed Jul 15 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"Nah, you eat it as one, and the two tortillas provide increased structural integrity."
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,perrythebari,9,Wed Jul 15 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"True it provides structural integrity but a part of me thinks it started out of generosity.  When I go to Mexico, our taquero is very generous. He even gives my abuelita and me a taco while we wait for him to be done serving other customers, every single time.  I think it started out like that somehow. People just aren't stingy with food over there.  That's one true thing, you might be poor as hell over there but everyone will give you a taco if they see you hungry.   I guess I should mention the freebie taco comes with one tortilla and not that much meat. The tacos we pay for are loaded and come with two tortillas. I've been able to make three decent tacos out of one. Great, now I'm hungry."
LifeProTips,3dbe3t,goldishblue,136,Wed Jul 15 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"1) it's not a soft shell. It's a tortilla.   2) you should be warming your tortilla prior to filling it, which makes it hold together better.  3) if you are using fresh tortillas this isn't a problem  4) cheese on the bottom makes it a quesadilla.   This is everything wrong with how Americans outside of the southwest (and Chicago, and a few other places) do Mexican food. You're just making shitty garbage folded sandwiches using faux-Mexican ingredients. Get outta here.  Edit to add: some people are trying to talk elitism here, or argue that things like American pizza are inauthentic. Firstly, it's pretty widely recognized that American pizza (at least in the northeast down to NYC and Jersey) is different from and largely superior to Italian pizza, so that's irrelevant. As to the elitism charge - most people who are making shitty tacos have probably never had a really good taco. For people who know the difference it is an obvious and unmistakable choice, like the choice between Tupac and Riff Raff, or the choice between a California bagel and a NY bagel. Some products are reinventions (like great Tex-Mex), but some are just shitty imitations. Get some real Mexican food to taste the difference. As one poster said below, if you want ground beef, lettuce, and tomato, why not just make a goddamn burger?   Also if you're ever in NY the best Mexican food is at the taco trucks scattered through Queens."

LifeProTips,3dc6en,petswinprizes,3,Wed Jul 15 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"""LPT: let's fuck up online shopping by showering them with demanding phone calls""  I absolutely HATE this attitude in customers, and the fact that shouting or ""not losing their bizness"" gets them discounts is tiring and draining for the people working there.   Sometimes there are sales, where prices are dropped. That does not equal refunds for everyone that bought it full price before the sale!  And why would you call a online retailer on a landline? Why not send them a angry telegram to really stand out and be precious?"
LifeProTips,3dc6en,Eywolf,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"Customer service departments are literally there for that. That is their job. I did it for years, I would know. It isn't irritating to have customers call unless they are rude and demanding, which you don't have to be in order to get a current sale applied to a recent order as long as it's reasonable, like one to two days before a surprise sale.   Calling on a landline gets you helped way faster than emailing in, if it's a one day sale then calling in is the best course of action."
LifeProTips,3dc6en,ijjimilan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"How is this tip putting you out of business? People will ask discounts anywhere, you can say no or say yes. This tip doesn't change that.   Giving discount to regular customers helps your business anyway. Why does any shop have sales at all do you think?"
LifeProTips,3dc6en,melvadeen,0,Thu Jul 16 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"I worked for an online retailer for many years. I started out when the company first began, working in processing and shipping. I eventually moved up all throughout the company and spent years working in the customer service department. When I started, I worked with less than 15 people, when I left I worked with 150 and the company was making double digit millions in revenue per year.   If a company is already having a sale, they should expect to be losing 10%-20% per order already, so refunding someone who ordered a day or two earlier should really not be an issue. If a few extra customers requesting the discount as well is going to break your bank, then you seriously should have not had a sale to begin with.   I am not saying that people should go wildly demanding discounts from very small time handmade, vintage, or specialty dealers for no reason. I am saying that if someone orders from an online company and they have a site-wide sale or sale on sale that applies to the order they just placed, they should call and ask for the discount."
LifeProTips,3dc6en,gotmilklol123,2,Wed Jul 15 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"You could check the return policy and the price match policy before you buy from an online retailer. You make your choice based on information that suits your needs.   I buy electronics from wally world, not because i love them, but because they have a great return policy if the item breaks. I buy clothes from the retailers who have free shipping, because I can't try on before I buy. I buy expensive shoes from another retailer because they have a good price match policy.  Be an educated consumer, and you won't go wrong."

Pointless to discuss really, courts will decide.  So many missing facts in a forum like this to make it very irrelevant.  I'm not sure about all states, but in Canada, you can't actually say you're carrying a butterknife for defense.  Just saying that is illegal as I understand it.   Could be some states have the same thing.  You can use it if you're cornered and fear for your life, etc... and courts will decide if you were justified or not.  Though in Canada I can legally carry around a Katana on my back.  I don't need a reason.  Here the laws make sense to me, it's all in the intent.  Cop stops you with katana, they ask your intent, if you don't say it's to commit a crime... no issue.  Of course they'll likely recommend you not do that, disturbing the peace, etc etc.... but no laws have been broken and nothing will come from it."

LifeProTips,3dbe87,stuck_with_mysql,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"To flesh out my argument - there are 3 groups of people.  A) Almost everyone: Those who don't judge others like this. B) Few who judge, but keep it to themselves. I'll never know about it, so to me their opinion is worthless. Their judgment does not affect me in any way. C) The 0.1% that are vocal about their judgment, but they are just jerks trying to feel better by putting strangers down. Why would you even listen to an asshole like that?  I was betting on OP being in the A category because most people are. Thinking that everyone is in the C category, or a B just waiting for a chance to become a C is not helping anyone."
LifeProTips,3dbe87,iApolloDusk,2,Sun Jul 19 08:28:33 2015 UTC,well to me the problem lies in the B group.  Just because i never hear about it doesn't stop me from worrying over it.  On top of that I've had people talk shit about me to friends about stuff that simply wasn't true and i only find out when a friend decides to tell me hey x is saying this about you. When its hidden in that way there's no way for me to defend against it until someone finally says it to my face. So to me a nice person who's quietly thinking something bad about me but is too polite to say anything is worse than that obnoxious kid spewing out random meaningless insults.  Granted this doesn't quite apply to the stranger situation also i realise my side is more irrational than yours but hey i felt like arguing!

LifeProTips,3dawl4,not_ryo_hazuki,12,Fri Jul 17 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"For sports I used to throw a tennis ball up on to a tiled roof. I couldn't see the roof and the tiles were raised, so the ball would bounce down and then fly off at the last second in an odd direction and I would try to catch it. If I missed I would do it again until I could do a hundred in a row.   By the end of it I was like a dog waiting for a stick to be thrown. And my reactions were incredible. I no longer thought before I moved, I just moved. Not long after I was made goalie of my soccer team because of how I performed in causal practices.  Another one to do is take a big rubber ball. Then punt it as high as you can in the air. Then run to catch it no matter where it's going to land. The more you do, the more you realize what you're capable of, and that impossible catches are possible. It also creates a mind set that just goes for it without thinking.   Overall you have to practice the thing you're not doing, so that your mind thinks of that first rather than whatever you're daydreaming about. i.e. If an attacking player gets past me I don't start thinking about how they got passed me, I start running to catch them the moment they pass me."

LifeProTips,3dawl4,TheFeelsGoodMan,3,Wed Jul 15 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"Monster Hunter is an interesting case because your character's movements tend to be a bit on the sluggish side most of the time, particularly when using some of the larger weapons.  That means that you have to predict the movements of the quicker monsters based on small tells in their movements and react to them accordingly, at times event before they do them.  That's great training for both attentiveness and reactions."

If you can afford to replace your phone if it breaks, you're better off not buying insurance over the long run on average. Cell phones also heavily depreciate in value as time goes on. If you break it a year or two after you buy it, do you really care? Just get a new one. It wasn't worth that much at that point anyway."

LifeProTips,3da4dx,onedayoranother,25,Tue Jul 14 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"You are totally entitled to your feelings. Feel them! They are yours!  That said, reading your post I am understanding that you are troubled by your feelings' presentation. Been there! What I recommend is to communicate everything through writing (email, memos, etc.). Not only does this allow you to make an emotionless argument, but it also presents a paper trail should anything go sideways.  If your supervisor wants to keep it off record - meaning away from any type of documentation - this is all the more reason to keep it on record. They don't want it documented because they are pulling some shady shit. Cover that ass of yours. Oh, and at the same time it'll also help with your comportment."
LifeProTips,3da4dx,theinfamousj,5,Tue Jul 14 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"They don't want it documented because they are pulling some shady shit.    Completely agree.  First of all -- if you cry as you describe, then you could end up being a target for workplace bullying, either by the supervisor or their flunkies.    Don't respond to emotional goading, you'd be surprised by how much staging goes on meetings, office politics, etc.    Do not defend yourself when attacked - take out a notebook and write down what the person is saying.  After they finish, thank them for their time and tell them you will respond via email. Do not fall for inquiries as to whether you have questions, need clarification, whatever. They know your weakness and are trying to provoke you.   I cannot stress enough -- do not defend yourself right there; especially at meeting. Write everything down and say ""I'll get back to you.""  They are trying to make you cry. To make you look unstable."
LifeProTips,3da4dx,tierras_ignoradas,14,Thu Jul 16 05:57:42 2015 UTC,"Disconnect yourself emotionally from the situation (as much as possible).  Look at the problem as if it were happening to another employee (or a faceless, anonymous person) and consider the facts of the argument."
LifeProTips,3da4dx,InappropriateTA,6,Tue Jul 14 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"This.  Put your rational brain back in charge.  Tell yourself ""OK, this is an emotional situation.  I'm not gonna lose my cool.  I don't have to be emotional.  I'm going to be the calm one here.  It's emotional but I am in control and I can handle this.""   You're now handling the situation the way a calm, super-cool person would handle it.    It works better than you'd think.  Give yourself a second to collect your thoughts, and respond in the most calm tone of voice possible.  Basically, you are acting.  You are an actor who is acting like they are not emotional.   If you feel yourself getting worked up while talking, just remember to very deliberately speak in a normal, laid back tone.  This takes effort, it's like forcing yourself to swim in icy cold water - but it's certainly possible to do if you focus.   If you get interrupted, don't let it get to you.  Let them finish and then continue just as you were.  Picture yourself as James Bond with the upper hand in the situation.  Totally cool.   Again, this all sounds pretty corny but I find that 1) recognizing the stressful situation and 2) reminding myself to keep my cool at all costs usually works - so long as I remember to do it and focus on doing it.  I definitely lose my cool once in a while, but not if I focus on keeping it."

If you know something is coming, think it through ahead of time.  A little bit of mental role-playing when you are calm ahead of time, is a game-changer.  Look around (discreetly!) for another job.

Even when it's something that isn't even a huge deal. I tend to jumble up my words and end up saying stupid things even though I know I am more intelligent than that. I think it has a lot to do with social anxiety. If I could argue behind a computer screen it would be much easier but in person...that's just way too intense. Maybe it would help to practice speaking your mind alone, as dumb as it sounds, but saying how you feel in front of the mirror and repeat with as much confidence as possible. Be serious and straight forward...but also smile and be goofy. Give yourself a power pose. Not sure if this is dumb advice but I think I'm going to give it a shot. Thanks for posting this!"

LifeProTips,3da4dx,StickyEastLABandit,2,Wed Jul 15 01:06:53 2015 UTC,"Your brain is responding to a stimuli.  You're so mad you can barely contain yourself.  You have to train your brain not to become emotional.  You can do the ""Superman Stance"" along with deep breathing combined with visualization at home.  I had to do this recently 'cause someone tried to take advantage of me.  Basically: you stand like superman, arch you back, shoulders back, pull your chin up.  I usually stare at the American flag when I do this because it's a visual symbol of power.  I do some deep breathing and when my mind is quiet, I bring an up an image of the situation - observe my response and do a self talk along the lines of: ""I'm calm I'm confident, feel the sensation of calm confidence in my spine, I'm at the meeting I'm doing great nothing can stop me"" ect.... The above is a combo of techniques.  It works great, after I did this I went and had a ""chat"" with the offender and all I can say is I've never seen anyone so squirm so much  I would also advise you to secretly record all conversations.  Last year I had a bad feeling about  a higher up, because I was going to rat her out for essentially stealing.  Long story short, she sweetly invited me into her office to chat, then sent an email to my supervisor saying I cursed, used profanity and physically threaten her.  What she didn't realized was I'd recorded the meeting (20 minutes).  The screen on my phone goes dark, so she though the phone was off when I placed it between us.  My supervisor listen to it.  If I didn't have that recording I would have gotten fired.  However had the company taken action against me based on her email, I would have filed a law suit against them.  So cover your ass.  I also used to work for lawyers and they always told me to cover my ass."

LifeProTips,3da4dx,lting77,0,Fri Jul 17 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with secretly recording a conversation between yourself and a boss that's out to get you.  Because in the final analysis it's your word against there's.  If you have a recording, proof of what that boss did, HR will take action immediately to keep from getting sued.  Nobody wants a scandal.  Regardless if a person lives in a one party or two party state, it's their responsibility to cover their asses.  If I didn't have that recording I would have lost my job.  I've worked freelance for years, I've been in companies where people got screwed over left and right and did nothing about it, only to complain later on.   Regardless of what a company's policy is: I'm still going to record if I sense something's wrong because MY policy is: I won't allow someone to harass me and accuse me of something I didn't do just because they think they can get away with it."

LifeProTips,3da4dx,fizzixs,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:30 2015 UTC,"Practice.    Most people mentally fall apart when they are threatened. (physically or psychologically)  In fact, a significant part of military indoctrination is learning to confront threat with threat instead of withering.  All they do is create consequences for acting weak and reinforce the lesson with repetition.  So practice defending yourself.  Get out of your comfort zone more often.  Additionally, you can rehearse a prepared response for the next time it happens.  Have verbal comebacks ready.  Visualize it.  Use body language, like squaring up, if necessary.  The first few times may feel unnatural and forced.  After a while, it will become second nature."

LifeProTips,3da4dx,jessajess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"My experience is that the tears come from frustration. Historically, in men frustration more commonly turns to aggression. Now the workplace is trying to grasp a wider response to frustration then aggression. Sometimes the workplace fails in understanding this fundamental change. I have known both men and women cry in the workplace.  I would recommend you do a little research on handling frustration. Find the tips that would work best for you based on your situation. This will lessen the frustration you are justifiably feeling and allow you to appear more strong.   As others have posted try to prepare to have to defend yourself by keeping an electronic trail of your activities. If all is in order, then I would begin trying to understand if the person or persons putting pressure on you are doing it to deflect from themselves or their mistakes or some other reason. Understanding their motivation may give you insight into handling them or at least always being prepared for them.  Good luck...been there."

So if you intentionally try to make your breaths longer (deep inhale, slow exhale), it will help to keep you from a full on cry.   It takes a fair amount of self-control to elongate the breath when all you want to do is breakdown and cry, but it has helped fight off tears on a few occasions.   Best of luck with your situation.

LifeProTips,3d9jm7,twoshirts,10,Tue Jul 14 15:44:45 2015 UTC,"I have excellent work/life balance, excel at my job, and I'm very passionate about it. I'll tell you how I do it:    I see a greater purpose in my job other than making money to fund my free time. I do not work for a non-profit or in the healthcare industry, so I'm not suggesting you find a job in a different industry. Instead, make sure you have a good attitude and good self-talk about your job. I think a lot about how my job impacts the economy and the various industries it touches. I think about how much my clients need my services to help complete their own jobs. I think about the progress of society, and how my job contributes to it in some small way. This makes me very passionate about what I do. I'm dead serious about maintaining work-life balance. My bosses and coworkers all agree that I'm one of the hardest-working people in our company, but you'll very rarely see me skip lunch, work late, or work nights and weekends, and I always take all of my vacation days. If someone asks me to do more than I'm capable of during my normal work hours, I tell them I'm very busy with XYZ, and ask if they can find someone else to help or if we can delay the project until I have more time. When a client calls on my lunch hour, even if I'm just sitting and chatting with my coworkers, I tell the admin to send it to my voicemail. If my workload gets too heavy, I talk to my bosses about bringing in freelancers or hiring more team members to take some of it on. People sometimes get a little testy about the measures I take to preserve that balance, but I ignore it as much as I can. I'm a productive and valuable employee, and I deserve my time to recharge.  I don't allow myself to stagnate. If I'm doing a job that is below my skill level that I no longer enjoy, I look for ways to pass it on to more junior employees and develop in other areas. I also make this clear to my managers and bosses. They are well aware that if they ask me to do grunt work for too long and don't allow me to develop, I will leave and look for another job. I don't make it a personal issue; I just let them know that for my own career, life goals, and personal development, I need to continue learning and growing. I turn problems into challenges. Sometimes when I have a difficult client relationship or a huge project that demands a lot of thought and creativity, I feel like running away from the office and never coming back. But taking a deep breath and telling myself these are learning experiences helps A TON. For the past year or so, I dealt with one of my bosses slowly descending into mental illness. It was a long time before everyone collectively realized she was not mentally healthy enough to be involved in day-to-day work. Several coworkers quit during that time because of the literal craziness in our workplace. Of course, I got frustrated too, but I started to frame dealing with my boss as a challenge. I learned how to handle her, how to direct her thinking and attention so that I could get work done without letting her interfere. I was even one of the people who finally addressed her mental state and the problems it was causing with the other company owners. I was able to turn a seriously unstable and negative work situation into a point of personal pride and growth.    I hope this helps!"

LifeProTips,3d9jm7,tanabanana13,4,Wed Jul 15 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"One thing I have learned is that YOU are the only person who values your time outside of work. If employers valued your free time automatically, then we wouldn't have unions and labor laws. You need to remind people constantly when you need more time for yourself, because they aren't going to think about it and advocate for it for you."
LifeProTips,3d9jm7,JessicaB224,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that advice! All great info. I'm going to pass it along.   I wonder if you or anyone has any advice for this situation: he has a hard time actually talking to his bosses and letting them know that he needs more, or that he's burning out from the work overload. It's a somewhat different situation because he works a military desk job, his bosses aren't particularly kind, and he doesn't view his job as particularly flexible. In my eyes, it seems as though he doesn't even have some of the basic rights like a union job would have. He doesn't have a required lunch hour. He doesn't have hours, actually. The idea is that they show up at a certain time and leave at a certain time, so with no set hours, he often has to work through lunch or he stays very late. Much later than anybody else, because he is the one person in his office trained and qualified to do his particular job. The workload often falls to him, and I think he has the mentality that everything must be done before he leaves the office that day, or else he'll have extra work tomorrow. His constant struggle is to ""catch up,"" but I just don't think that's realistic. In his field, his work will never be done. I have suggested that he prioritize and put off some things to tomorrow, but maybe someone else with more work experience could put this a better way, or suggest a better strategy for time management."
LifeProTips,3d9jm7,tanabanana13,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"The most important thing you said in this whole post is that he is the one person in his office trained and qualified to do his particular job. Think like an employer here: finding a qualified employee and training them to do a valuable job is a huge investment of time and money. Ergo, an employer does not want to lose a qualified and trained employee. If that employee negotiates for better working conditions, the employer would probably rather compromise a little on working conditions than lose the employee. Your husband needs to go into negotiations with his boss with the mindset that he is ready to look for a new job and leave his boss a hand short at any time. This gives him the upper hand and the confidence to stand up for what he deserves.  A problem I noticed is that your husband thinks he has to finish all his work before he leaves. This is a dangerous mentality. If you get all your work done every day, your boss doesn't think you are overloaded. If you start telling your boss that you will be unable to finish that amount of work in the time allotted, then it becomes a #1 priority for your boss to fix that problem, and he has to face the fact that you're overloaded. In other words, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If your husband's boss still expects him to finish the same amount of work even though it requires him to put in extra hours, then his boss is a dick who is taking advantage of him, and your husband needs to find a new job.  The best thing you can learn about the career world is that it's eat or get eaten, survival of the fittest. Normal rules of altruism and loyalty don't apply. You have to be selfish and look out for your own interests, or people will take advantage of you to make more money and promote their own careers. The career world is ruled by greed and ego, and you have to learn to play by its rules. If you give someone something that gets them money and recognition, then you had better make sure you are getting money and recognition in return. A job is a transaction, and you cannot let yourself get the shit end of the deal."

A few things...    Couldn't gather if you work remotely or in an office-type setting, but TAKE BREAKS. Keep a schedule and take micro-breaks every hour and longer breaks to clear your head. Along the same lines VACATION. Make time to get away and unplug.   How are your relationships with your co-workers and managers? Team dynamics have a huge impact on work happiness. When you're spending the majority of your day with people, its essential to have good working relationships. What are your personal and professional GOALS? Do they conflict? Do they coincide? Where are you going in 5-10-20 years? Are you working towards something greater? Some people are very content with not moving ""up"" - however, many of us find no purpose in work if we don't have goals. You said part of the job is managing poor performers. Do you have access to tools and resources to help you with this. Is this an aspect of the job that is essential? I.E. Can you talk to your manager about this since you don't seem to enjoy or excel. Are there other opportunities in your company? Is the 24/7 on-call thing an actual policy? I understand the telecommuting norms, but you DO NOT need to be available 24/7 (unless it is actually required e.g. doctor).     Look, unfortunately we often put up with miserable jobs for the rest of our lives because they have some perks and flexibility that make our non-work hours better. But, YOU NEED TO LOVE/BE HAPPY doing the job you do. We spend the majority of our adult lives WORKING. What are we WORKING towards?"

I would recommend listening to this podcast by the Heath brothers: http://heathbrothers.com/member-content/podcast-on-decisiveness/ It is specifically about  deciding to find a new job or not.  Some of the suggestions that helped me: 1. Imagine you are stuck in your job for the next 5 years (like a prison sentence) what actions would you take to make the job endurable? 2. Set a trip wire Establish a time frame or dollar amount.  e.g. ""If 2 months from now I am still working 80 hour weeks then I am quitting."" or ""Once I have six months of income saved in the bank I am done"" Again, I would recommend listening to the podcast.  I think it is the only episode."

In my case I was able to combat burnout at a previous job by focusing more heavily on furthering my education, but this was likely only a temporary fix. Ultimately I think the most important thing is to understand precisely WHY you're burned out, think about what adjustments need to be made to realize a more fulfilling life, and start working to make those changes. More often than not looking for employment elsewhere without understanding the root causes won't lead to a long-term fix."

The only time I've ever seen anything like that were on computer monitors and such, because their default setting was no sharpness or blurring added.  But anyway, I guess better advice would be to set your tvs sharpness at whichever setting changes nothing.

LifeProTips,3d5g2k,newmewuser2,-3,Tue Jul 14 05:35:11 2015 UTC,I don't doubt that. I just used to sell TVs and every single one had awful default settings for sharpness.  I would display a crosshatch pattern on them and not a single one looked better than just setting the sharpness at zero. So I made the assumption that all normal tvs were similar.
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,TechNut79,5,Tue Jul 14 05:38:37 2015 UTC,"This is making a lot of assumptions  my tv has it at 50 by default, 51 increases sharpness, but 49 decreases it  0 is where it takes 50 and adds a softening effect to make it look like shit"
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,Xacius,-4,Tue Jul 14 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the time the default setting adds sharpening already. This is because tvs have to compete with each other on showroom floors and want the image to pop as much as possible.  If you want to test if your tvs default setting is correct or not, hook a computer up to your TV and display a bunch of small text.  If the text has tough jagged edges, then your TV is sharpening the image.  Computer text is anti-aliased and should be soft looking."
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,whitesombrero,6,Tue Jul 14 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"Here's a good test. Simply hook up a computer/laptop up through HDMI and pull up a website with a lot of text (reddit or google news).  If your sharpness is in the 50's (pretty standard), you will see a blur type effect around the text. This is what sharpening does.  Turn down the sharpness till it just looks like dark text on white with no blur type effect."
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,rumblerfish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:07 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I've been telling people to do who have challenged me on this.

LifeProTips,3d5g2k,Death_Star_,2,Tue Jul 14 06:44:36 2015 UTC,Then sharpening is partially more useful and you should set it where it looks good to you. HDMI gives a pixel perfect signal and sharpening is just not necessary.

LifeProTips,3d5g2k,workalex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"That is more the last step rather than the first.  OP is very right that image enhancement features of a TV will usually mess up the picture but more often than not it's already fucked before that. Any number of things, from non-native resolution, the wrong connection to the TV (think composite instead of HDMI), poor bitrate (usually a problem with streaming video, but not exclusively), exaggerated color setting, etc. will mess up the picture beyond recognition.   Feed an LCD running the factory default color and brightness settings a 576i picture from a streaming service through composite video and sharpness is the least of your problems next to the exaggerated candy colors, gray instead of black, deinterlacing issues and a lot of noise.   Run a 1080p (or at least 1080i if you have a good deinterlacer) picture with 20MBit/s+ through HDMI on a well balanced plasma and once you get used to the natural picture, you're not going back."
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,SomalianRoadBuilder,-5,Tue Jul 14 04:58:39 2015 UTC,This is definitely correct. I guess I made the assumption that the average redditor feeds their tv the native resolution and uses proper cabling.

LifeProTips,3d5g2k,FamilyDoubleDare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:32:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in this thread think out of focus means lacks hard edges. It's a product of being trained to look at video games and over sharpened images. Most images shot on film have no perfect hard edges. What you think is out of focus is in focus. It's just not as sharp as digital algorithms are capable of making it.   I don't think there are any TVs that add blur, that thread is all speculation which can be explained as I have here. People just don't know what in focus means or looks like. It does not mean, as sharp as possible without artifacts. It means whatever was captured by the camera without additional processing."

The director's post production team uses advanced sharpening techniques already and the picture is already as sharp as they want it to be.   This would be useful if you were only playing content that was completely honest to the source. Most of the time you aren't. Cable is first processed by the broadcaster, where that showing of Independence Day gets the broadcaster's audio and video processing. Then it is processed on the relay network. Then, and most destructively, it is processed by your cable company which usually means gross over processing."
LifeProTips,3d5g2k,Carlsinoc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:21:19 2015 UTC,Not so fast! Sometimes the cable/Satellite provider will use too much compression. Especially when there are a number of fast-paced sporting events going on at the same time.   Increasing the sharpness can in many cases compensate for that.

LifeProTips,3d5f38,the_most_basic_bitch,21,Tue Jul 14 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"What /u/the_most_basic_bitch said. I work as a retail clerk for a small boutique shop in a small tourist town. It's a very rare day that I'm busy the whole shift - I can say with certainty that I've had fewer than a small handful of those in the few years I've been working. Normally, I get a spotty trickle-in of customers and window-shoppers broken up with a few brief busy spells, all heavily bracketed with long stretches of nothing. Naturally, I've got to be in the shop the whole time we're open (and very often it's just me, unless it's the busy season), but I literally have hours a day of nothing to do between customers. This is especially true in the off-season when I can go a whole day with only a few scattered sales. Realistically, there's just nothing else to do once I've done a round of shelf-straightening and maybe swiffered the floor or put another page of shop-logo stickers on a fresh pack of shopping bags, all of which together might take 10 minutes if I straighten the shelves while I swiffer.  I end up spending a lot of time on FB. But I also use the time to work on my language (I'm learning Italian, and the app I'm using involves spoken practice and lots of recorded sounds, so I can only really use it when the shop is empty) or other bits and bobs of self-improvement. I do my homework when school is in session. I also try to have a project on hand to work on (I knit and draw) for when I run out of other activities to keep me occupied. But really, it's just me vs. the empty hours vying for my sanity most days.

LifeProTips,3d5f38,tacitus42,3,Tue Jul 14 03:30:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's also usually directly proportional to what you're paid- USUALLY (usually, assholes!) jobs where there's plenty of time for fucking around like mentioned in this boutique example pay far less than say a job where you're slammed doing something like say IT administration all day.

This really helped when talking with coworkers and especially students, both culturally and linguistically. It also helped me find a job when I came back to America, which can be hard when you have a liberal arts major and no real domestic work experience.  I'm at a different job now, but I do much of the same when I have free time. I research things important to the organization, I ask other departments if they need help so I can have a more balanced understanding of what we do and what our needs are, and I end up getting assigned tasks that I wouldn't have otherwise. Free time is just another way to build and expand your skill set and responsibilities--if you use it properly."

Hit up the Mturk and beermoney subreddits if you'd like to earn extra money during downtime at work. Tons of folks over there do MTurking while at their job to supplement income.  7 weeks in and I've pulled over $900 while being a stay at home dad.   edit:  Holy crap.  I know it's not much, but to me, 28 points is huge.  Thanks guys!  Come stop by /r/mturk for more info!  Hit up the sidebar FAQ and ask any questions you might have.  We love helping out new people.  :]  edit#2:  -blink-  I was...  not expecting anything like this.  The post I saw here 2 months ago mentioning MTurk and beermoney saw not a single upvote or reply; I couldn't even find it just now.  My karma has quadrupled in a day... not bad for a post I slapped together while on the toilet (survey about toilet paper lol).  It's the end of my night and I'm gonna blast out some replies to y'all.  I'll likely be pretty busy this week, but I'll try to come back around when I can.  Some screenshots:  My last 45 days - As one can see, my earnings vary quite a bit.  Some days I couldn't do much, some days there wasn't much to do.  Keeping in mind I'm 7 weeks in, and during the summer..  I'm pretty happy so far.  Today's HITs - Finished the day around $14, maybe $16 or $17 counting some bonuses that came in.  I probably could've pulled $25, maybe $30 today, but I passed on plenty of slave-wage HITs that break your spirit and mind.  So yeah, I could have made more, but it wasn't worth it today.  How much time did I actually spend Turking?  Hard to estimate, I can say that $4.00 at the bottom took a solid 25 mins, which is close to $10/hr.  But of course, it wasn't a full hour's worth of work.  I'd say I spent about 2.5 to 3 hours of the day actually doing work."

These tasks can be anything from academic/marketing surveys (think Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, etc), transcribing audio from spoken word, data transcription, and lots more...

You might be able to get an MTurk account underage, but once you have one and it's banned, it's all over. They'll probably never reverse the ban, so just wait it out and check out some other earn money online solutions.

LifeProTips,3d5f38,AuntieSocial,10,Tue Jul 14 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"There are lots of jobs (like mine) where someone has to physically be in a place to keep it open but there's not always stuff for them to do (I work in a shop in a small town, usually as the sole employee on the premises, and during the offseason I can have hours of downtime but it's not like I can just leave or close the shop and clock out between customers). Jobs like this are perfect for alternate work like MTurk, as long as we're not ignoring customers or other aspects of the job in favor of it. I can't imagine the owners giving any fucks whatsoever what I do in the dead space (assuming it's legal and not dangerous to myself, the store or the product), because I'm basically being paid to be there so they don't have to run the whole thing themselves seven days a week. Usually I just do homework or work on personal projects, but I can't see them caring if I did MTurk (which I seriously need to consider) as long as I brought my own computer to work on so I wasn't tying up the work system."

In September, when academic studies come out in full swing, I'm hoping for a $100 day at least a couple weekdays per week.  My highest day so far has been ~$47.

LifeProTips,3d5f38,MeltingGlacier,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not just you.  I did already know what Adult Swim spot you were talking about before I even checked though, it was posted to /r/mturk quite a while back.  The spot was definitely inspired in part by the ideas of crowdsourced work.  But did you read all the comments?  Cuz there were plenty of negative comments before you posted, and some more after.  Mostly about the US-only requirement, but there's more now.  Anyway, here's some crappy things about MTurk for you or anyone else that might read this:  -Amazon fee restructuring on the 22nd is causing a lot of pessimism and frustration on both sides, workers and requesters.  Search mturkgate if you want to see the rage.  -There are scammy requesters that want to plant malware or get free work by rejecting HITs.  Amazon barely moderates these things, so new Turkers can get blasted hard by not being too careful.  -There's a high learning curve which practically every FAQ I've read ever mentions.  It takes a lot of reading and dedication in the beginning to ensure one will do well later.  -When late teens/college kids come by to ask if MTurk is good for them, we tell them to look into part-time jobs in their relevant to respective field.  Volunteer or intern to boost that resume.  While practically anyone can make some money on MTurk, it's not a lucrative option for many people.  For OP's request, MTurk fit the bill, so I mentioned it (honestly expecting it would go by unnoticed, like when I read about it on here 2 months ago).  -edit:  Oh, and one SHOULD be skeptical when looking into something like this.  I was skeptical as all hell when I was looking into it.   Took me several hours of reading and research to understand how it worked and if it could be useful to me."

I'm not really knowledgeable enough to give links or names, but there are video lessons available online for free, as well as virtual routing and switching programs so you don't even need to spend money on the equipment to learn. A classroom is good if you need structure and guidance, but if you like working on your own it's definitely possible.

We drank him under the table, carried him to the next bar, and let him sleep it off while we kept on going until the next afternoon. He never tried to keep up after that."

Sikh doctrine explicitly forbids participation in the caste system, as well as treating people differently due to religion, race, or gender.

LifeProTips,3d5p7g,Darknessborn,3,Tue Jul 14 06:52:02 2015 UTC,"I know that there is a Sikh temple (it says temple on the sign) nearby.  I looked up their website and it says ""Every Sunday Kirtan 11 am to 1 pm, followed by Guru Ka Langar.""  What is Kirtan?  Or Guru Ka?  Am I welcomed to stay for the whole time or show up after?  From the pics on the website, it looked like the women and men sat in separate rows.  Is there any special etiquette?"
LifeProTips,3d5p7g,8TC,2,Tue Jul 14 07:00:31 2015 UTC,"Men and women sitting separately is more of a cultural remnant rather than a Sikh-taught practice, you're free to sit where you like, we do more than lip service in regards to equality."
LifeProTips,3d5p7g,Darknessborn,3,Tue Jul 14 10:40:52 2015 UTC,"Kirtan is basically a chant. They read verses from the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book. Guru ka means of the guru or in the name if the guru.  In all the Langar's I've been to men and women do sit separately. Its always respectful to take of your shores before you eat. This is actually more comfortable as well because usually langars will have you sit on the floor."

Always felt embarrassed to eat, since I am not Sikh, so I just ate a bite out of respect.   QUESTION: Is it appropriate to eat, or does it make it seem like you are there for the free food?  Also, on a lighter note, some puns:  -Mr Singh calls up for work and says ""I still can't come in today, I'm still Sikh"" -Good Punjabi food always makes me feel Sikh. -Our mission? To Sikh out new life and new civilizations.  If this is offensive, apologies, just love puns."

It was a while since I read this (rather conservative article) and forgot that what it's message was not to clarify thing, but to adopt giving the ""correct"" name as a practice as to avoid merging cultural/religious identities. www.sikhnet.com/news/gurudwara-not-temple-op-ed"
LifeProTips,3d5p7g,DoctorPringles,0,Tue Jul 14 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"That article is ludicrous. I don't see Mormons'  crying foul when their place of worship is actually called a temple. Temple is such a broad term and encompasses the place of worship of many different religions. Getting people to call a Sikh temple 'Gurdwara' is like getting them to call a Hindu temple 'Mandir'. You can't truly expect that to happen in western countries.  The guy in the article calling the Gurdwara a temple should not be the issue, the only issue is the dudes ignorance (not a bad thing, he was just starting to learning about a new culture)."
LifeProTips,3d5p7g,michaelhands,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:50:12 2015 UTC,"It's not really that impossible. After all we say Church for Christianity, Synagogue for Judaism, Mosque for Islam. Is it really that impossible to use Gurdwara. I know we don't do it for Hinduism, I always wondered why, I assume it is because Hinduism is so old and nebulous compared with other religions. Also Hinduism isn't practiced by a largely single language populous, like the other major religions. I agree though that if you don't know the term for any religious building, temple is probably the best word to use."
LifeProTips,3d5p7g,KasperFriendlyGhost,-4,Tue Jul 14 11:50:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, places like Wall St or Vegas may be called things like the temple of American Capitalism, to communicate they are central locations in certain activities."

I must say, I somewhat agree with /u/uoftrosi in that making everyone call a Sikh temple a Gurdwara by default is unrealistic. Certainly, we can educate people (as this OP did, by saying ""Sikh temples, Gurdwara"") to make sure they are aware of the different terminology, but temple is such a widely-used and accepted term that it won't be going away.   To me, the author of that article is worried because Sikh is adapting to the times and conforming to reach a wider audience, which he sees as a bad thing. I think that point, itself, is very debatable and the true heart of the issue, not the terminology being used."

LifeProTips,3d7o4u,JLPwasHere,9,Tue Jul 14 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Here is a video that explains why (linked to one of many relevant parts).  Even if you THINK or KNOW that what you're going to say won't hurt you, consider yourself dumb, or more specifically, ignorant. You cannot predict the future and, if you truly are innocent, you have no fucking idea whether an innocent fact might trigger a cop's senses and make him even more suspicious, more likely to arrest you, or even just more likely to keep question you. Because you don't know everything the cop knows, or everything about the situation. You may even make an innocent mistake or tell an irrelevant truth that implies a motive, or likelihood of guilt, or even some random coincidence that could be mistaken for guilt by a person whose job it is to put people who look guilty in jail (this is my favorite part of the video and an excellent example of how talking can make your life hell). And the cops don't have an obligation to introduce exculpatory evidence you told them that may help you. In fact it may be prevented from being introduced by the rules of evidence!  TL;DW  - There is no way to predict whether even speaking truthfully and reliably could be used to prove your guilt in court. And if you really are innocent, you're in an even less knowledgeable position in terms of what you say. It probably can still be used against you, and if it can, it will be used against you. Cops will even tell you this when arresting you.  So SHUT THE FUCK UP."

In Canada I have been pulled over twice, as soon as they asked I just reached over to the glove compartment and grabbed what I needed.  I get the feeling that a cop would never (well, unless you're wearing hunting garb or being pulled over outside a range or something) expect that you had a gun in Canada and therefore would be more comfortable with it."

Remember cops get lied to all the time and are expert lie detectors.  Never underestimate a cops laziness.  Avoid interacting with the police whenever possible.  The rest depends on circumstances.    If you are at a house party that gets busted vs. getting caught with a kilo of heroin.  You will probably walk away in the first circumstance, not in the second.

LifeProTips,3d7o4u,MetallicGray,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"Always remember the stress a cop is under even on a simple traffic stop. They are trained to be on guard at all times. More than one police officer has been shot over what could have been a speeding ticket.   As others have mentioned:   Be polite and respectful. Yes sir, no sir goes a long way. Keep your registration somewhere you can reach it without digging or leaning over. And have it and your license ready to go when the officer gets to your window. Turn your interior lights on and roll down your windows. This shows you are not hiding anything and can ease some of the officers tension. Turn your engine off and keep you and all passages hands where the officer can plainly see them. If you did something wrong expect that you will get a ticket for it. Stay calm, do not argue, revert to number one. Sometimes an officer is so surprised by your reaction that a ticket will turn into a warning, plus if ego is involved you have already fed theirs a little. Crying and pleading will do absolutely nothing for a seasoned officer. You can curse and cry later. If you are faced with one of the few ""dicks"" do not argue your point on the scene. Remain polite and respectful. Arguing or proving a point then will only, I repeat ONLY make matters worse for you. Make a  mental note of the officer's name and badge number and start taking a mental recording of everything that happens. If it is a minor traffic ticket in some states you can contact the DA's office (North Carolina yes, Virginia no) and calmly explain the situation. Otherwise get a lawyer ASAP and tell them EVERYTHING that happened calmly using your mental video.   Source- my brother is a police officer + getting out of plenty of tickets using these things."

I am sure there are differences in each department.  It could be either. For example if there have been community complaints about speeding near a school, the sgt might have officers camp that area until people learn to be smart. Otherwise a police officer on traffic duty has a lot of freedom to patrol (drive around) or camp in spots that are known trouble spots while they wait for calls on the radio.

I've relapsed and haven't gotten out of bed for a week. my hands are drenched with sweat as I type this.  keep telling myself I have done nothing wrong...but depression and anxiety have gotten 10x worse.

I am in my 40s, have never been in any trouble (not even traffic tickets), always been pro-cop, always had positive and respectful interactions the police I've met in my small town....now, because of one asshole cop on a power trip, I'm wrecked, emotionally and financially. next time I apply for a job, I imagine I will have to relive and explain this experience (because, even though I didn't do anything wrong, and expect this will go away, it was published in the newspaper's police report).  the cops are not your friends. even if most are good people, there is a very real risk that you'll get a bad one on a bad day, and get screwed. plus, they are always looking for ways to pad their arrest statistics. it's very obvious how the town will profit from all the fees I'm going to pay (for instance, my car got towed about 100 feet, which cost a lot to get back).  treat them like sharks. there's a real chance you can get bitten. stay away at all costs."

Completely innocent, truthful statements put people in prison all the time.   You weren't ""put in jail"" by your truthful statement, it's that you were in a sketch situation at a party that was catered by theft, not the beer fairy, whether you had knowledge beforehand or not.

Don't move them until they ask for something.  Have your license, insurance card, and registration ready.  Roll all windows down so they can easily see inside when they approach.    Remember that cops out up with a lot of shot and they don't know what kind of nut job they just pulled over. Anything you can do you lessen his/her anxiety will go a long way to getting you off the hook."

If you're getting arrested, they already have you and anything you say beyond that point is just going to be used against you so don't incriminated yourself further. Just ask for a lawyer ASAP because they are really the only ones that can help.  Another thing is that they can ask to search your house/car but have no legal grounds for doing so without probable cause or a warrant. Its similar to the 'keep your mouth shut' thing, they're looking for evidence and you don't want to put yourself in the position where they can find some, because they will. Source: Cops."

If you remember this and treat them as such, you're one step ahead in the game.  Sharks have teeth and their bite will seriously mess you up.  So, stay away from them.  If you see them involved in a feeding frenzy (IE swarming around with guns/batons out teeth bared, get the hell out of there! If there's a bunch of fish acting stupid blood in the water, get the hell out of there without attracting the attention of any of the sharks!  If you're on the road, ""swim in the shark's wake."" In other words, always stay behind them, and not too close to their tail.  Sharks are hunters.  Don't be prey.  Let some other stupid fish get bitten.  Also remember that sharks sometimes hunt in packs.  Make sure you watch your tail too!  If you happen to catch a shark's attention, do everything you can to keep from getting bitten.  And remember: There are nips, there are slashes, and there are bites that will take your arm off.  Learn how to get off with a scratch and let someone else lose a limb.  But if you do get bitten, sometimes it's better to sacrifice a limb than to lose your life.  Police are sharks.  They are not pets.  They are not your friends.  They are there to clean the seas of fish not smart enough or fast enough to stay clear of them.  They are top tier predators dressed in blue.  That's really all you need to know."

LifeProTips,3d9wmc,feau,8,Tue Jul 14 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Often people's thoughts of ""studying"" is an abstract thought. So decide,what do you want to do today? Do you want to take notes, read, memorize?   Break down what needs to me done in smaller fragments and do them one at the time. Start by the things that don't seem very hard.   Example: Say you need to study for an exam, start by learning the index of the book. What's where? How can I obtain certain information? What do I need to read?   Start with a part of the test, a small piece that you need to know. Quickly read through the text. Don't try to learn anything, just read through relevant parts.  Write down everything you know on the subject. Everything you knew from before and anything you managed to pick up from books or lectures. (it's very motivating seeing that you actually learn, studying can feel pointless at times)   Read again, and highlight, take notes.   Now take a blank paper and write down everything you know now. Compare to first sheet. It's very motivating to study if you feel you actually learn something. As knowledge gets established in your brain it's easy to think that these things are not new information, but that they always have been there.   Another tip is to use the ""cliffhanger method"". That means that you stop studying when things are going well. If you stop because you're to tired or hungry or bored you tend not to want to go back to studying. But if you stop at a high, you'll be more likely to want to sit down and study next time (at least more.)   This turned out kind of long, hope it was to some help!"

I make the password a long standing goal. We have to change it every month at my office, and the computer locks us out after a few minutes, so I type in my password probably 15x a day. I make it something like ""study for that test"" or ""update your resume this month"" or ""finish this project strong"".

LifeProTips,3d9wmc,AKLawrence,3,Tue Jul 14 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"Turn it into a rock solid routine. Have a place in your house/apartment where you ONLY study. Don't read for pleasure, don't play video games from that spot, nothing! No social media, no texts, no calls, nothing but what's absolutely necessary for the studying. Use the same lighting every time. Use a desk lamp so when you click that light your brain recognizes that it's study time. Pick a music genre or band and only listen to them when studying. Seriously, not at the bar, when you're driving, nada Study at the same time every day, if possible, or have a set day-to-day study time that is not to be interrupted. Shut your door, don't answer the phone, don't go to the coffee shop instead ""just this once"".  It's not a pleasant practice but our brains respond to routine. That's why parents set nap times and recess was always at the same time through the year. School was training your mind/body, you have to put those practices into effect. Good luck!"

I found if I studied with the sun coming from the same way, it really stimulated my brain.  Attaching location, position, music to memory are all great ideas. Another one is to attach an unusual but pleasant scent. In Japan (supposedly), the office release a nutmeg scent in the afternoon to perk the staff up mentally.   If you have a tiny cottonball of essential oil when you study, and the same scent during the test (put in it a ziploc bag so you can control when the scent is released) it can be very helpful.  Opening the bottles (which I used only for studying) became a way to actually kick-start the studying itself.  I usually used a blend of citrus & rosemary."
