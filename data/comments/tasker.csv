tasker,3e3xln,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:29 2015 UTC,You can use the library locally. I just decided to host it on a webserver myself because I couldn't get a locally stored copy working (turns out I was typing the folder name wrong). But I fixed that up and made an example task[0].  Put the js folder somewhere and then on the JavaScript action change the directory for sjcl.js to match where your copy is. You'll probably have to tell Tasker where encrypt/decrypt.js are too. You might also want to replace the sjcl.js copy I included with your own to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.  [0] https://www.dropbox.com/s/54utobtaptm4otb/tasker_encryption_example.zip?dl=0

tasker,3e3xln,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:16:00 2015 UTC,I use TextSecure to talk to people and it doesn't have a client for the Nexus 7. I made a scene to write and send messages with AutoRemote and something on my phone to open TextSecure to write the message.  The whole point of TextSecure is your conversations are encrypted so it seemed counter productive to send 50% of them to my phone in clear text. So here we are.  Now I'll slowly make something to sync my notifications and send/receive sms because why not?

As far as making backups, I'm usually really good about that and honestly I'm surprised I don't have a backup somewhere, but I can't find one so it's either find a way to change the version code on the existing apk and then re-sign it or rebuild the app from scratch, I think."

Finally, it launches XBMC, which runs PseudoTV live on startup (A plugin that generates 'fake' TV channels from your media).  I also have a profile that sends a WakeOnLan signal to my pc when it connects to my wifi (when i'm returning home). Pretty standard right?

Google Now is great in concept, but I don't travel much or go to many shows, etc, so I don't get many useful cards. I decided to make my own! I laid the groundwork for the widget design today and set the first things to go into it (certain Hangouts notifications, certain weather alerts) with plans to add more. The color scheme of the (Zooper) widget changes based on what is displayed, and buttons on the widget change dynamically based on the card at hand.  I plan to implement ""Pebble support"" later, but this took a lot of effort for one day. I haven't decided how I want them to behave on my watch, so I'm just happy with the widget for now."

If you paste the URL into chrome, it just takes you to a page asking you to download the app, but if you make tasker navigate there, it opens the app for you.

tasker,3dyy81,Gedrean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"When I leave my area for work in the morning, Tasker triggers a notification with traffic times for the highway I normally take.

Sleep mode that dims screen (app: Darker, excellent Tasker integration), progressively dims and increases red color over the course of 15 minutes, lowers all Tasker check timers to minimums, sets cpu governor to conservative, turns off autosync, and all that battery saving jazz. It allows me to stream Spotify's ""Sleepify"" playlist while sleeping and wake up to more than 50% battery power.  Sync TitaniumBackup's directory on Monday morning, documents folder M-W-F, internal memory, and SD card weekly using Foldersync app (again, excellent Tasker integration).  Downloads and reads weather when alarm goes off. Alarm Clock Plus broadcasts an intent at every alarm, and Tasker parses an XML file online with weather info. The British lady announces, of course. Launches Waze and turns on GPS when at home and plugged into car charger. Shuts off Waze when at work at unplugged (and turns off GPS). Same for reverse trip. It also launches Waze when I leave either area for duplicity. Launches sleep mode when headphones are plugged in during silent mode. Otherwise plays Spotify favorite playlist on shuffle if in normal sound mode. Launches Digitally Imported if vibrate is on and opens up classic vocal trance. It also sets all my settings for charging credit cards if I'm in my car and the little reader is plugged in. Disregards it all if in a media app already."

So I created a task that starts only when I put my phone on the wireless charging pad at night.  It puts my phone in priority mode.  It launches Sleep as Android to start tracking my sleep cycles (to wake me up only when my body is not in deep sleep).  It sets Lightflow to sleep mode so that I don't wake up from LED notifications.  It sets email to manually fetch email.    It only exits from my sleep mode if I pick it up off my wireless charger after daybreak or after I disable my alarm.

tasker,3e0qq8,onering20,2,Tue Jul 21 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Tasker's learning curve for the most basic things is fairly straightforward, but then the curve gets steeeep. And it's always frustrating when you've got some of the advanced tools, but only have half the picture of how to implement them.  So, moving on to AutoInput gestures, the first thing you should do is create a Profile that detects AutoInput>Gesture>Any by leaving the config blank (it will tell you to not check any boxes). Link it to a Task that does firstly this Action:   A1: Alert>Flash: %ainame      That way any time AI Gestures mode is enabled, if a gesture is registered it will Flash to you the direction (Up, Up and Left, etc.) that way you can troubleshoot if needed whether the mode is on or off, and what it's picking up.  After the Flash Action add an:  A2: AI>Gestures>Disable IF %ainame ~ Down and Left      This will let you ALWAYS exit/disable gestures without any Wait statement etc, as long as you Gesture Down and then Left with your finger. The Task will let you know too, since the first thing it does is Flash to you what type of Gesture you made.   Next, and you may have missed this in the documentation, make note that you can still interact with the screen when gestures are enabled. Instead of swiping with one finger, you swipe with two fingers close together. Instead of just clicking on something, you click once, then double click fast.   This is by no means meant to really be able to navigate smoothly, but its just there if you really really need it. (in case your Down and Left 'exit' method isn't working etc).  Now, in that same Task, simply add whatever you'd like to do based on the direction of the swipe/gesture. So if you wanted to launch your Test Task on an Up gesture:  A3: Perform Task: Test Task IF %ainame ~ Up      Hopefully from there it gets you going with this. Gestures are a neat idea, it's somewhat random what they're good for though. I use them in the middle of a long AutoInput Task that navigates to something, and then I have to make a choice based on what I see whether to continue or not. As it blocks the screen from any clicks, I either continue (Right) or exit (Down and Left).  The other thing it's good for is locking the whole screen of the phone, INCLUDING the status bar, at least on my Note 4. You could set your own pattern lock this way, so that you (or whomever) can still see the screen, but the device/screen can't be messed with unless a certain pattern of sequential gestures is entered.  This is actually good for making a tablet or device as a 'Display Only Device'. Since you could even set Tasker to Enable Gestures at Boot.   Would be interested to know once you got it up and running what you find it usefule for."

So as you have triggers for ignition on/off, you could have IFTTT send that info into Tasker, as long as you have data access. But that's a rather 'big loop' way to detect if this.  The most direct way is as you mention, via Bluetooth. First BT Near isn't always effective. I wouldn't count on that much. Second, I would ask how it uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone, if your phone shows nothing connected. If you switch Bluetooth off, does it cease to function?  Unless there's some work-around specifically in the app to be able to do this, in which case it would me to ask - would simply detecting if the app is running be a good trigger?

Does the 'Automatic' show up in the available Bluetooth Device list that you can connect to? The same list where your shower speaker is listed, basically 'paired devices' ?  If it does, I would try setting up a Profile>State>BT Connected>[Automatic device]  Then link it to a Test Task that just Flashes ""Automatic Connected"" as an Enter Task, and another that Flashes ""Automatic Disconnected"" as an Exit Task from the Profile.  Then go turn on your car and see if Tasker detects it. If it's a Bluetooth device listed in the paired devices listed, I would think you can choose it in the BT Connected State.  If that doesn't work, change the device in the Profile to your shower speaker, and then test it out with the speaker connecting. See if Tasker Flashes you the message when it connects/disconnects with the speaker. If it works with the speaker but not the Automatic, there must be something to how the Automatic interacts with Bluetooth on your device."

If I have 5 pages, and I'm on the 5th page, and I swipe up, my %Page variable will be set to 6. I swipe up again, it will be set to 7. Then, I need to swipe down twice before it's back to page 5 and swipe down again to go to the previous page which is not intuitive at all. Is it possible to set a max or min value for a variable? So if I swipe up past page 5 nothing happens to the variable.  I'm thinking about adding a task to the next page action that's basically just a if condition that states if %Page > 5, set %Page to 5? I'll try it out after I post this.  Issue 2: Weird action when calling previous page action on page 1  If I'm on the first page of Nova, and I swipe down, it jumps to the 5th page. wut.

I have trouble with formatting so just ask me to clear up the post if there is any issues.  So the Profile triggers off of two things: 1. Launching Spotify and 2. Mobile Network is on.   If both requirements are met the following tasks will run.   AutoInput action:   Configuration- Type Text, Value: Navigate up, Action: Click (This opens up the side menu on Spotify)   AutoInput action:   Configuration- Type: Id, Value: com.spotify.music:id/navigation_item_config, Action: Click (This clicks on the settings button in the side menu)   AutoInput action:   Configuration- Type: Id, Value: com.spotify.music:id/settings_offline, Action: Click (This clicks on the Offline Mode switch)  So the task works, if I am on Data and Open spotify it automatically clicks the button. The issue is that if I close Spotify or press the home button and launch it again it triggers again and the AutoInput path will turn off offline mode. Is there anyway to stop this from happening?

So the way I would do it is pretty simple.. use a Variable as 3. trigger.. (state>variablevalue{or sth like that}) call it whatever you like.. for example ""%offlineMode"" and make sure it will trigger, once the variable is set to 0..   Now, to make it where it won't trigger again and again and again a... in your task (where the autoinputStuffMagic is happening) you'll just add a ""Variable set"" task and make it set to 1.. with this, it won't trigger again as long as you are on mobile data only.. to make it trigger again, you'll need sth to set the variable back to 0.. and the best bet would be the second profile in my opinion.. so once you connect to your wifi.. just add another ""variable set"" inthe second profile_task and make it set to 0.. now it'll trigger your first profile again, once you leave your wifi range.. and of course if the other triggers trigger (huehue)..  it doesn't matter what you set your variables to.. you can switch them or give 'em an actual word like ""on"" or ""off""... just make sure that the first profile will only trigger as long as the variable is NOT the same as what you set the variable to in the same profile_task..

tasker,3dxubs,kameleon25,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:29 2015 UTC,Can you be a bit more specific about what you want to accomplish?
tasker,3dxubs,spjadoe05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"Basically I have a couple of scenarios:   I have an app that streams videos and sometimes I get a ""network error"" and it just hangs. But if I click OK and go back and start the video again it does fine.  Any time the words ""next video"" or similar come up (after I have finished watching a video/movie it always pops up in the same spot on screen) I want it to press it.    I'm thinking this would require some kind of constant screen OCR or similar, even if just for #2. #1 could be the notification deal most likely."
tasker,3dxubs,spjadoe05,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:33 2015 UTC,There is a plugin call AutoInput that you should look up. It's capable of doing this exact thing and a lot more
tasker,3dxubs,spjadoe05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:13 2015 UTC,I have a few of the auto apps and have been meaning to try the autoinput one. Now that you say it does what I need then I will definitely give it a go.

tasker,3dwtmg,blizterwolf,3,Mon Jul 20 04:46:55 2015 UTC,Try LMT or pie. You can assign a touch spot on the side of your screen to call up a radial menu that you can assign nav keys and apps to. I use lmt on my N5 with navbar disabled.    Edit: LMT requires root http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1330150

But other than that- amazing."
tasker,3dwtmg,Bevlar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:13:48 2015 UTC,Never had that happen. It crashes every now and then but I just open up tasker and launch lmt which resolves it.    If you don't like the info surround you can disable it in pie settings. I don't mind the info but I don't like that it overlays the whole screen.

tasker,3dx8qo,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely. You could have Work Profile from 9-5, but also an additional Lunch Profile that has extra conditions trigger say at time from 1-2pm etc."
tasker,3dx8qo,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:42 2015 UTC,"Make a Test Task, just put one Action in it:  Alert>Flash %TIME      Just run it right there in the Task Edit Window. This will make Tasker Flash the time it currently thinks it is (in 24-hr format). So if you know it's currently 6pm and Tasker Flashes ""14.02"" (or ANY numbers other than the current time, 18.00 in this case) then there's a time tracking problem. Not sure what the fix is on that one if that's the case, someone might.  But if Tasker Flashes the same time your phone currently has, then make sure yes, you have completely backed out of Tasker for that Profile you've been working on to activate, and when you go back into Tasker the context should be lit up green."
tasker,3dw8oa,ablindmantwo,3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"First I would ask how you think it 'seems' to have received the shared link/data?  Does it Flash a Toast? And do you have the Profile configured correctly?   Because either it's sending nothing, or if its sending something it should trigger the Profile, and the Task it's linked to. It would help if you got into some real specifics of what exactly you're trying to do/share and at what point in the sequence the process seems to stall.  P.S. Also you mention running/activating a 'Task', but there's also a Profile involved in the process, and you don't mention Profile anywhere, so you've got to be clear on that part too."
tasker,3dw8oa,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:34 2015 UTC,"When I share something the AutoShare toast comes up saying that there is only one command so it is using of by default, and then another toast pops up and states the text from the shared link (I am using the unpaid version).  Yeah, I've got a profile set up with AutoShare as a state, configured to use event mode and activate on a certain command, although I have tried it without any specific command and it still won't work. I have also tried it as an event instead of a state with still no luck."
tasker,3dw8oa,Ratchet_Guy,2,Mon Jul 20 09:11:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if the toast shows up it's working properly on that side.   In your Task - what are you trying to do with the information from AutoShare? Because it sounds like that's where the problem is.  For testing create a new Profile that uses Event>AutoShare (not State as an Event) (then specify nothing in the config just back out of it) and link that Profile to a Task that Flashes all the AutoShare Variables:  %assendername Name of App that sent the share  %assender App that sent the share  %ascommand Selected Command  %asfile() Shared Files  %assubject Shared Subject  %astext Shared Text      In fact you can copy/paste the above right into your Flash Action. See if Tasker Flashes the info you shared. If Tasker flashes the info correctly, then the issue is within the other Profile you set up and/or the Task you've linked it to.  Also I have to ask again, what is it specifically you're trying to share, from what app, and what are you trying to do with the information once it get over to the Task?"
tasker,3dw8oa,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to show %astext in a notification as a test.

tasker,3dukfh,basically_lol,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Yes,  I have this working on mine, and I love it.  It requires Nova or another launcher that allows tasker to go to a particular home screen.  Nova Launcher is awesome, so you should think about using it anyways.  First, I use wifi or bluetooth or something to set a variable ""Location"" to home or work or car based on where I am.  For each location, you need a profile and a task with just a single command: Variable Set %Location to Work.  While you are setting the variable, its a good time to also adjust other setting that are appropriate for that location.  For example, in the car, I set the volume to maximum, and enter drive mode (reading txt messages out loud, playing music, etc.)  At work, I set volume to low.  Then I created a task called ""Set homesecreen""  which basically says  If %Location~Work, then Go Home Page 1 Else if %Location~Home, then Go Home Page 2 Else if %Location~Car, then Go Home Page 3  Finally, in Nova's Gesture & inputs settings, I have the home button assigned to the task ""Set Homescreen"" and uncheck ""only on default page""  Now, my home screen changes to fit the place that I am in.  When  I press the home button, it goes to the right homescreen with tasks and widgets appropriate for where I am.  Let me know if I can help further."

tasker,3dukfh,AlfofMelmac,2,Tue Jul 21 10:46:32 2015 UTC,I think standard launcher is different between phones.  Which launcher do you currently use?  The app drawer in Nova is very customizable.

tasker,3dsqui,belovedunt,2,Sun Jul 19 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"I think you might be able to do it. Firstly, on whether UI Query can pull the information, I would ask are you absolutely sure?  To confirm, run a Test Task that waits a few seconds for you to get to the screen you want to Query, runs the UI Query, and then sets the both %aitext() and %aiid() to the Clipboard.  Run it once for what the screen looks like when it's thumbs up, run it again when it's thumbs down. Take the results of each from the clipboard and paste them somewhere you can get a better look at them side by side, like a text editor, or on your chromebook/laptop/tablet etc.  I would say take a realll close look if there's any difference any where, and if you'd like, post the two text sets and id sets on here and maybe someone here can find the difference you can key in on.  OTHERWISE, the pixel color thing seems intriguing. Are you saying though that every single time you run it, AI returns a different color? Even specifying the same point? I would think that it would return one color when it's thumbs up, and one when its thumbs down, and that would be it?   Strange if you're running it when it's thumbs up and 5 times in a row it returns 5 difference colors. Also make sure you have the right coordinate, by turning on 'pointer position' in developer options.  Check these out, and report back :)"

It'd be good if aitext()  or aiid()  had some info in them.  I'll try putting a pause of a few seconds in there to see if that makes a difference.    One interesting thing I found out before is that it looks like you can get the next songs from aitext even though it's not displayed on the screen at all.
tasker,3dsqui,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"Very welcome! I think aitext() / aiid() is the most direct one, and if not go with the image/crop/compare option.

And I think this is what may work in the long run. The only thing to watch out for is anything else on the screen which could change, such as the status bar. This would likely changes the average color of the screenshot.   Thankfully there's a ""CROP"" option in the screen shot setup. I think this where you're really gonna solve this issue. Figure out the coordinates of the area where that thumbs up/down button is, so rather than a pixel your getting a shot of the entire area of just the thumb.  Then use pixelcolor or average color, and I bet you'll come up with a consistent result to use in your IF evaluations!!"
tasker,3dsqui,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"SOLUTION  Okay I figured it out. This is actually super cool. These AutoApps plugins just keep getting better and better. At the verry bottom of the AutoInput Screen Capture config is a setting for ""Compare"", so this will automatically compare it for you!  It creates a variable named:  %aiscreenshotsequal      That returns ""true"" if the screenshot you're taking matches one that was previously taken. Now, using this in addition to the crop feature will let you detect whether the thumbs up has already been set. As long as the thumbs up icon consistently appears in the same place on the screen each time.          So first, you'll setup a ""Setup Task"" that is going to screenshot the area of the Thumbs Up icon of how it looks when it is set/lit up. Figure this out by again using the Pointer/coord option in Developer Options on your device. You'll only have to run this Task one time, unless in the future the icon appears somewhere else on the screen because they changed the app or you're using a different phone/tablet with a different screen.  So, in AutoInput you specify an exact area to screen shot in the ""Crop"" field of the config. It takes 4 comma separated parameters in the form of:  start_x , start_y , length , height      So if you pick the point just to the upper left of the thumbs up icon, lets say its 400,600 and you want a square box sized screenshot 250 pixels square, that will adequately cover the icon, set the initial crop area to 400,600,250,250  Then, in your Setup Task, choose a screenshot filename of path/path/thumbs_up_active.png   All you need in this Task is a Wait statement, and then the AI>Screenshot, and then put a Flash Action of somethiing like ""Finished!"". So run it, and during the Wait time you gave yourself, go to the screen with the thumbs up already set to 'thumbs up', wait for ""Finished!"" to appear, and you'll have screenshot'd your 'control' file that you'll compare all future thumbs-related screenshot to.  So go into Gallery or wherever you view pics, and make sure thumbs_up_active.png is to your liking and adequately captured the area.          Then go create your main Task/Actions, the one(s) you're going to run in the main Task you've been creating. When you get to the point in your Task where you need Tasker to figure out whether thumbs up has already been set, run AI>Screenshot, specify a filename like: path/path/thumb_current_status.png  Set the SAME Crop Area as you used to create the control image, so here for example purposes it would be 400,600,250,250  Then in the ""Compare"" section of the same config screen it will ask you for a filename of a previously set screenshot/image to compare the new one to. Of course here you specify your control file you created in your setup Task: thumbs_up_active.png  Now, as soon as the AI>Screenshot runs in your main Task, it will screenshot that exact same area of the screen every time, and if matches your original thumbs up image, the variable %aiscreenshotsequal will be set to ""true"".  So if you just wanted to stop the Task from proceeding clicking thumbs up, if it's already there, you'd just use:  Task > Stop   IF %aiscreenshotsequal eq true      For fun, here some screenshots based on this example. Config screen of AI Config Screenshot, and Task outline."

tasker,3dsgbw,fenchai,4,Wed Jul 22 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"I LOVE THESE THREADS! =P  Anyways here's what I've been up up to:  I'm enjoying the new AutoBubbles AutoApps plugin, that makes floatable icons that can be configured to do anything on tap/doubletap/long tap. I made a Profile using AutoNotification and takes notifications from apps that constantly generate them and pile up in the Status Bar (annoying me) that often have so many messages they don't even all fit up there, and I intercept the notification, turn it into a popup bubble based on its default app icon (fetched via AutoLaunch) or, a custom over-ride icon I've assigned that I like better than that app's icon.   Each individual bubble icon keeps its own log of intercepted notifications that I can see if I tap once on it. It will clear that list if I double tap on it. It will launch its related app if I long click on it. And if I just don't care I just swipe it away with a finger flick and it disappears.  Here's an example of say when I wake up in the morning I might see instead of a status bar full of crap, I get a screen that looks like this .As you can see if have Gmail and Playstore notifications, a missed call (with a custom icon), and a Drive Autosync update (again custom icon specified).  If I want to keep them out of the way for a few moments until I feel I want to deal with them, I just put them up wherever for the moment.  If I want to see what that app's been telling me not just since the last time it notified, but thru many past notifications, each bubble keeps its own log, so for example if I click on my Drive Autosync Icon/Bubble it will flash me the times and text of all its recent notifications etc.  So does that qualify as 'unknown'? lol"
tasker,3dsgbw,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:38:59 2015 UTC,Amazing. Care to provide a guide of some sort?
tasker,3dsgbw,spjadoe05,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Let's see..will try and outline steps:   Set up Profile AutoNotification>Intercept, choose all apps that you want to create popup bubble/icons for. Link to Task that firstly sets a global var based on the name of the app, to the value of the notification text, and use Append:On so it keeps a running list or recent notification texts. Format would be Variable Set: %%anapp Value: %antext Use AutoLaunch>Query to get the icon path to the app's icon. Simply use %anapp as the query, and it will return %alicon(1) as the app's primary icon. Use the new AutoBubble plugin to create the bubble, choose size and positioning. For Bubble Name set it to %anapp. For icon/image use %alicon(1) that AutoLaunch returned.  The bubble plugin has Actions that can be assigned to tap, long tap, etc. Make up your own name syntax according to whatever you like. So I use Tap>LaunchApp=:=%anapp, LongTap>FlashText=:=%antext Then create a separate Profile and Task to handle all AutoBubbles commands. Can specify for example %command and %data as the variable names assigned to either side of  the =:-=  Then make an Action in the handler Task that uses AutoLaunch to Launch App: %data IF % command eq LaunchApp Same for showing the notification data. Action>Flash %%data IF %command eq FlashText      And that about it lol."

tasker,3dsgbw,spjadoe05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:26 2015 UTC,I was able to set it up. For some reason though it doubled one notification and didn't show one of each like I expected it to.
tasker,3dsgbw,spjadoe05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"Cool! So, okay, there's a couple steps you need to add and it'll work fine. (There's lots of steps so I tried to get them all in lol).  First, in the Bubble Config, where it asks you to name the Bubble, set the Name to %anapp. This will make sure each Bubble that is created from the same app notification won't double the notification, since anytime you set a Bubble with the same name as one that already exists, it simply gets replaced.  Then, make sure that you have the Task Settings (little slider icon) set to 'Abort Existing Task'. That way for multiple notifications they will take precedence over any already in progress. OR, you can also try to set it to ""Run Both Together"". (since again making a Bubble of the same name will replace the one that exists, even if it's a split second later). Either one of those should make it work as it should.  There's one more thing to add/do, but get this part working first and then I'll give the final Action. It basically has to do with replacing the spaces that occur in an App's Name with underscores, since Global Vars can't have underscores. It's basically just a Search Replace."
tasker,3dsgbw,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm gonna give you the whole XML to download. You should be able to hook this right up to your AN Profile. Only thing to set up would be anything with a checkmark at the top, and in the Bubble Create Action at the bottom, customize your Actions (Tap/Long Tap).  Posting this up because there's a lot of other steps I created that were just too much to put into the outline. What's good is that as you're familiar with the whole setup/process, you'll be able to figure out real quick by looking at the Task what anything extra does.  For example if you want to assign custom icons for certain apps, there's a var assign field for that you'll see at the top."

I'm hoping I can rely on user's feature requests to guide future development, but as of right now the plugin only brings up the list from the notification like the Astrid Locale plugin.  The app has geofence reminders for individual tasks, and now that I implemented list reminders for this plugin I will probably add geofence list reminders. But when a Tasker plugin was originally requested on the issue tracker I was told that geofence list reminders were not an adequate replacement for a Tasker plugin. So here it is :)"
tasker,3dnanf,Ratchet_Guy,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"Well there's an idea for it yes - Tasker can detect geofence zones, especially with the plugin AutoLocation, and then I guess say if you were near the market, Tasker would trigger a Task that uses your plugin to bring up the appropriate/designated list?  As a first 'feature suggestion' I would suggest that when your plugin runs, it has the option to basically query ""Tasks"" for any/all information you can access, and return it as pre-defined Tasker variables that a Tasker user can then use to do as they wish.  Even though you're not a Tasker user, you should take a look at all the ""Auto Plugins"" and how they're setup.  If you structured your plugin similarly it would be of great use. For example using AutoNotification, upon choosing that plugin there's a whole submenu that pops up.  From this if you select say ""Query"" you can query any notification up in the status bar and the plugin automatically returns and sets variables in Tasker for any/every piece of info available about it. So in your plugin, if you could Query ""Tasks"" and specify a particular list or group or whatever, and dump that info back to Tasker..  ..A Tasker user can then make use of that data in literally 1,000 ways, of which creating a notification is just one. And of the easiest most simple ones actually. The power to pull any/all requested (or avialable) data over from ""Tasks"" is what would really make your plugin powerful, and worth $2.99 ;)"

Then Set a Profile that Triggers at 6:20   Profile > Time > 6:20 AM/PM   Link it to Task:   A1.Variable Randomize: %random Min: 1 Max: 20   A2.Wait %random Minutes.       This will make the Task proceed anytime between 6:20 and 6:40  As in the other replies you could get all complicated with multiple Profiles and Global Variables and la la la but for the specific purpose you stated, this is the most straightforward method.  Also, I'll give you a blurb from the UserGuide about why it can be best to avoid using multiple time context Profiles that effect each other when possible:  When the global variable value changes, the time context is reevaluated which may result in it activating or deactivating. If the variable value does not specify a valid time then the profile will deactivate (if it's already activated).  *Note*: in some cases it may be wise to disable the profile (via the Profile Status action) before changing the associated variable values. For example, if your time context is from 16.00 to 16.00 (i.e. acting as an event) and it should be changed to 17.00,17.00, if you don't disable it first then as soon as you change the first value the time context will become a 23 hour range (17.00-16.00) and probably activate."

Adding load downstream of the car's fusebox is a good way to blow a fuse.  Manufacturers don't typically overrate items by much.

The easiest way to do it is plug your power adapter into an ACC (accessory) line in your car, or require that outlet into the accessory line. I have a nexus 7 mounted inside my dash and it has been a huge project. I'd recommend getting a 12v DCDC USB converter, hooking the converter into your ACC line, then plugging your tablet into that.   Edit: Another way you can do it is buy a Bluetooth OBD2 adapter and use torque to monitor your engine and output into a .CSV. Have Tasker constantly read that .CSV and then flip the screen on and off based upon that. You'll likely want a Bluetooth obd2 adapter anyways. Look into a USB otg y cable while you're at it. I put lots of time into mine, so let me know if you need help."

As you can see there is an Extra field for voltage, and it does slightly change. The voltage Extra value is stored in %voltage in the entry task triggered by the received intent.

When this was asked previously someone state there are apps which will all forcing of orientation (I don't have any to suggest since I don't use one).    I do have a really janky-assed way though...If you don't care about interacting with the screen you can create a scene the has nothing on it, is transparent, and is set as Orientation: (whatever you want). Then in a task you can show scene as a Dialog or Activity, Full Window, No Bar. You can get out of it by using the back button."
tasker,3dfd25,plepleus,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"Was thinking of a way using your solution that elements on the screen could be interacted with, and realized that if you have AutoVoice set to Continuous Listening you could just call out the item name of something to click on that's on the screen, or even use words Back/Home, etc. then follow it up with an AutoInput to click on the item spoken.  Only thing is seems that sometimes AutoVoice may jump out of the Scene but if you put the show scene action within that Task, when its done it simply flip it back to landscape.  So:  AutoVoice Listen For:    (?:Click on )(?<item>[a-zA-Z0-9\ ]{3,12}  AutoInput > Click > %item  Show Scene <landscape scene name>      Or if not want to use Continuous Listening can always put a small button in the 'landscape' scene' that brings up the AutoVoice Dialog using the above Action List, so even if it pops out of the Scene after clicking on what is wanted, it goes right back to your Scene solution."

As soon as I turn the car on, my phone connects via Bluetooth to the car for the purpose of making hands-free calls.   The ""previous input"" in this situation would be AM radio since that was what was selected when the car was turned off the night before. Using my current setup in Tasker, it then launches Pocketcasts which begins playing a podcast over the phone's built-in speakers. So I end up with AM radio playing over the car's speakers and a podcast from the phone.  Previously, with the Bluetooth Connect and Play app, my phone would not begin playing a podcast until I actually selected ""Bluetooth"" as the audio source on the car stereo."

tasker,3d8r5w,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's its primary purpose so...yes.  How long it waits around depends on how you have the timeout set, both in the UI Query config and in the Action timeout.   I think I'm running the beta which does away with the timeout inside the plugin config, but depending on what version of AutoInput you have check under Advanced, etc. and set the timeout to a longer number of seconds, and do the same in Tasker as you back out of the config.  And setting a long Timeout is also a good way to see if AutoInput is actually picking up on what you're looking for. For testing place a Flash Action right after the UI Query that says like ""Detected!"" and that way you know it's moving forward upon seeing what its looking for if you've got the timeout set to like 2 minutes and it moves forward well before that."

tasker,3d5b8v,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"As I said I believe Zooper caches the image so turning the screen on and off doesn't do anything.  Even rebooting does nothing.  Here is something I found on an old XDA thread.   ""Zooper caches external images for its widgets and doesn't reload them after the initial load. If you want your image to change you have to use the same method Media Utilities uses for the coverart: Save the image under a different name on each save (append a random number or a timestap to the name), push the path to the new image as a variable to Zooper (lets say ""CHANGINGIMAGE"") and then use that variable as an advanced parameter on the bitmap module in your Zooper Widget"""
tasker,3d5b8v,Ratchet_Guy,4,Mon Jul 13 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"I remember this issue. First the long answer, then the short answer lol ;)  That XDA thread is only partially correct. If you did it that way you'd have an infinite pile of images being stored on the device, or - as you mentioned - you could simply store the current/previous image pathname in a Tasker Global Variable, delete it, and then...  ..come up with a whole new number based on a timestamp and append that to the end of the file when you copy it. This may be the simplest way to do   HOWEVER, the actual truth is that Zooper will update the image everytime Tasker pushes/update a variable that has a different name than the existing one. So if you have two images on your phone named Zooper1.jpg and Zooper2.jpg and constantly have Tasker copy/overwrite those images and send that info (whether 1 or 2) to Zooper, Zooper will update the image. For example:  [b]$#TIMAGE#=1?//sdcard/path/stuff/zooper1.jpg:/sdcard/path/stuff/zooper2.jpg$[/b]      That will do it, and is something to take note of if you see what its doing..   BUT in this case, the simpler answer is to yes, choose a new filename based on date time/datestamp and delete the old one. So in Zooper:  [b]#TMYIMAGE#[/B]      And then in Tasker, you've got to get the current date. There's a number of ways to do this, but I use this Task from the Wiki, as it returns the current date in a format I can specify.          ANYWAYS - if you want something quick that immediately solves your issue right now today, just use this:  Action > Javascriptlet > Code:      Copy/Paste this code block into the Code section of the above Action:  var now     = new Date();  var year    = now.getFullYear(); var month   = now.getMonth()+1;  var day     = now.getDate(); var hour    = now.getHours(); var minute  = now.getMinutes(); var second  = now.getSeconds();  //MAKE TASKER VAR NAMED %datetime  var datetime = year+'_'+month+'_'+day+'_'+hour+'-'+minute+'-'+second;      <THEN PROCEED ON IN TASKER WITH:> Set Variable: %source_filepath Value: <put path to your source file and name>  Set Variable: %new_filepath Value: /path/to/destination/%datetime.jpg  <DELETE THE OLD FILE IF IT'S NAME EXISTS> Delete File: %LastZooperFile    IF %LastZooperFile IS SET  <LOG THE NEW FILE NAME IN A GLOBAL VARIABLE FOR FUTURE> Variable Set: %LastZooperFile Value: %new_filepath  <COPY THE LATEST FILE OVER WITH ITS NEW NAME BASED ON DATETIME> File > Copy File   From: %source_filepath   To: %new_filepath  Plugin > Zooper >    ZW Variable: #TDEALIMAGE#   ZW Text: %new_filepath      Then in Zooper just set the bitmap in Advanced Parameters by entering:  [b]#TDEALIMAGE#[/b]      And then everytime Tasker deletes the old file, copies a new one, and send the new Variable over, Zooper will update. Enjoy!     EDIT/NOTE: Sometimes Zooper wants more complete filepaths than Tasker works with. If you find that's the case just enhance the path right before the last action where it sets the Zooper var if you need to prefix it with /this/that/etc"

Then put that into AutoInput. Which it seems you already did, just want to make sure you have it correct.  Also make sure the app/screen you're trying to click on is on the screen when that AutoInput Action runs. So if you're trying to test it from within the Tasker config, add a 5 or 10 second wait Action first, then run it and switch out to the WeMo app and see if it clicks anything successfully after 10 seconds.  If that doesn't work, then - there's just some apps/screens/etc that AutoInput can't interact with. They're fairly random and not all that often, but it does happen, even in device settings screens/menu's etc. If you've tried everything including the pure x/y and it's still not working, this is likely the case."

Just create a profile with a context WIFI connected and in the WIFI SSID field type   *airport*/*Airport*   Connect it to a task which creates a notification with your desired reminder message.  Moving to the first question, it's possible with 2 profiles. The first profile sets a random time between 7am and 9am. The second profile acts at the time set by the first.  The random time will be measured in seconds. So between 7am and 9am there are 7200 seconds.  Profile 1: Set a random time.  Context:      Time: From 7am, To 7am //This makes it act like an event.

tasker,3d1f0q,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:57:28 2015 UTC,I feel like this is an excellent work around. However I think to really do this in a robust and scalable way you should consider using SQL with tasker
tasker,3d1f0q,DigitalOSH,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:27:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   And regarding SQL, actually, that's what I had mind in implementing this, but in the sense that Tasker can more easily query a database and as long as the db is setup to return values in this format (or whatever format is chosen), they're immediately available in the Tasker Task.  Like if you wanted to setup a scene to display all kinds of data, anytime you add a var/value to the SQL db and its output, you can just start referencing its name in the Task/Scene without adding any other Actions, etc."
tasker,3d1f0q,DigitalOSH,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:31 2015 UTC,AFAIK you have to recreate the scene for it to update though
tasker,3d1f0q,DigitalOSH,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"If the Scene is referencing Global Vars, which could be piped over by this method simply by using any capital letter within any of the varnames, the Scene (most specifically text elements), will immediately update without any need to delete/hide/show the Scene itself.  And/or - Since any Scene (and its elements) can be 'talked to' by any Tasker Task once the Scene is built/showing, all kinds of data could be dynamically re-assigned into existing Scene elements, even if those elements have no existing varname linked to them, as every Scene element has an ID/name that can be used to address it.  EDIT: Even you need more elements in the Scene you can create them on the fly with the Scene already showing using Scene > Create Element."
tasker,3d28w6,PacMann_,3,Sun Jul 12 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"The first thing you're going to have to clarify (and make sure you understand yourself) is the difference between %PACTIVE and %PENABLED.  The first variable %PACTIVE only contains values when that Profile triggers, which for a lot of Profiles can only be a brief second sometimes.  The second variable %PENABLED is a list of every single Profile that has its little 'switch' set to ON, whether it is currently running or not.   Not sure what you mean by 'one label'. Label isn't a type of field in either Zooper or Tasker. Do you mean a Text element in Zooper? For every variable in Zooper you want to access, you need a separate/individual Action in Tasker to set it. If you want 10 different variables to be available in Zooper, you're going to need 10 Tasker Actions to set them, (and you can't use a loop because the Zooper plugin for Tasker doesn't accept Zooper var names dynamically).  And of course in Zooper you reference them with #VARNAME# - Maybe if you post some screenshots of your widget and Task it will help to clarify what you're trying to do."
tasker,3d28w6,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you!!!! Alright, so I think I'm on to something with your directions here. %PENABLED is actually what I'm looking for. I noticed that %PACTIVE just flashed the text really quick instead of sticking there. BUT! Now the whole app crashes when I try to use that tag (%xxxxx). It worked for a bit and then zooper wouldn't stop crashing so in Uninstalled and reinstalled it and now it won't even let me use it without crashing.   I want the name of the profile to appear on a widget when said profile is active.   Hopefully that's a little clearer. I'm still getting used to the vocabulary of both Tasker and Zooper."
tasker,3d28w6,Ratchet_Guy,2,Mon Jul 13 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"I actually think I might know why Zooper is crashing.   In Tasker if you're setting back-to-back Zooper Set Variable Actions (one after the other) and you encounter this issue - you should set a Wait Action in between each Zooper Variable Set Action. I use a Wait time of 1 second just to be safe, but I think you might able to get away with 500ms.  It just seems that sometimes when trying to bunch of Zooper variables from Tasker all one right after the other, if the Wait isn't there in between, Zooper just crashes. In which case restarting your device should fix it. Just fix the Actions to use the Wait before you run the Task again, otherwise it's Zooper crash again."
tasker,3d28w6,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:39 2015 UTC,"So, in Tasker, my trigger should stay the same and my task should consist of 1 - wait one second and 2 - plug in / zooper / configuration / %PENABLED / %PENABLED   And this might fix zooper crashing.   Is this correct?"
tasker,3d28w6,Ratchet_Guy,2,Mon Jul 13 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"In the Action > Plugin > Zooper it should have two fields. The one at the top is the name of the variable you're going to use in Zooper. You have to name that manually by hand for every one of those Actions, as you can't use a variable there (and nothing with a % char).  Only in the value part can you put a Tasker variable. So:  Action > Plugin > Zooper Variable   ZW Variable: #TMYDATA#   ZW Value: %my_tasker_var      And then if you've got a bunch of those it would look like:  Action > Plugin > Zooper Variable   ZW Variable: #TDATA1#   ZW Value: %my_tasker_var1  Wait 1 Second  Action > Plugin > Zooper Variable   ZW Variable: #TMYDATA2#   ZW Value: %my_tasker_var2  Wait 1 Second  etc      If you want to screenshot your Task and/or Zooper Action config might be able to catch anything that's out of place."

tasker,3d28w6,nickm_27,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"Took a look. It's like I had mentioned, the top value must be simple text (with numbers) but no other characters, especially %  So you could have:  Action > Plugin > Zooper Variable >   ZW Variable: PENABLED   ZW Text: %PENABLED  <AND WHEN YOU EXIT THE CONFIG IT WILL SHOW YOU>      ZW Variable: #TPENABLED#      ZW Text: %PENABLED  <AND WHEN YOU GO INTO ZOOPER REFERENCE:>   #TPENABLED#      And that should do it. Tasker uses a prefix %, and Zooper uses a front and back hash # to mark its vars. That's what the plugin does, transform one to the other. And it also add a ""T"" to whatever name you put in the varname field, to indicate it's coming from Tasker.  In config  Out of config"

And I realized, that although this is the most simplest/straightforward way of doing it, there arises the quandry of - what happens if your phone isn't on at midnight?  Then the variable never gets reset. So if you really wanted to take it to the next level, in a new Profile/Task, that runs on Context > Device Boot - check for a variable we'll call %DuolingoResetDate and if it doesn't equal today's date, immediately set the other var to NO, and write today's today to %DuolingoResetDate"

Then you can check whether or not %Duolingo is greater than 0.   I run a streak notification that checks if I ran all the apps I was supposed to for the day and then adds to or clears the streak."
tasker,3d1njc,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"The one thing with this method is that it's triggering every time any of those apps is opened, and performing the add variable Action. So at the end of the day, you're going to have lots of different values, all likely greater than 1.  Which actually could be cool if you wanted to know how many times you opened any given app during the day (i.e. you opened Gmail 8 times, and Drive 5 times, etc).  But if you just want a simple yes or no, you should add a context to any Profile to only trigger if the app is opened AND the variable != 1  That way anytime after the first time the app is opened during the day, the Profile will never trigger.

If you set the quality to ""Good"" as opposed to ""Perfect"" (which I think only matters with photos larger than 10mb anyway, also those aren't the actual terms used) you get unlimited storage that doesn't count against your Google Drive storage and some really awesome search and organization features.  If, on the other hand, you want to do it with Tasker and store them directly in your Drive in a folder, Folder Sync should do the trick. It will sync your cloud storage services directly to your phone and can be set to run only over wifi, while charging, etc. It can probably handle it alone but also has Tasker integration for more fine tuned control."

I set mine to   Todays weather for AUTO   I added another one just to update all weather information since I had some errors with -300 degrees.. so just in case.. and the rest is pretty straight forward.. you just add  Alert>Say   and type your text in.. so I wrote   Good Morning {name}... Today it's gonna be %weatherace_weather_desc and it's going to be %weatherace_temp_max degrees. that's gonna feel like %weatherace_feelslike_max degrees.

Today it's gonna be %weatherace_weather_desc and it's going to be %weatherace_temp_max degrees. that's gonna feel just like that.

You can make her say what you should wear dependent on the weather and your calender.. etc etc.. endless.. just add stuff via if contexts.. Again..

However, on my phone, it really doesn't matter since it's all 16:9. But, I need Tasker to be able to nab from different folders. Which is where this issue comes from.  I could just have a duplicate of my wallpapers, all in one folder again, but that would waste my small drive space. And I could have tasker move the files from the folders onto one on my phone, but I think that would cause an infinite loop of DLing, then moving.

Just designate the name/path of your folders into an array, and have Tasker first choose a folder at random, then proceed with picking a random wallpaper within that folder.  So:  Variable Set %folders1 Value: ""Pictures/Wallpapers/ Variable Set %folders2 Value: ""CoolPics/Stuff/ Variable Set %folders3 Value: ""Whatever/things/stuff/pics/etc/""  Variable Randomize %num Min: 1  Max: %folders(#)  Variable Set: %final_folder Value: %folders(%num)  List Files Path: %final_folder <etc. then just proceed as normal>      So that should do it, according to what you've described I think.

tasker,3cys6m,MatityahuC,2,Sun Jul 12 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"Actually realized the easiest way to do this as true random. Since the List Files Action returns an array, where each array item includes the full path to the file, and, a Javascriplet can be run to join all the arrays together, that's all that needs to be done. And then just random choose from the final array.  Variable Set %folderA Value: ""Pictures/Wallpapers/ Variable Set %folderB Value: ""CoolPics/Stuff/ Variable Set %folderC Value: ""Whatever/things/stuff/pics/etc/""  List Files Path %folderA To: %files_in_A List Files Path %folderB To: %files_in_B List Files Path %folderC To: %files_in_C  Action > Javascriptlet: Code:    var all_files = files_in_A.concat(files_in_B,files_in_C);  Variable Split %all_files Splitter: ,   Variable Randomize %ran Min: 1 Max: %all_files(#)  Variable Set: %wallpaper Value: %all_files(%num)  Action > Set Wallpaper: %wallpaper      And that Javascriplet takes arrays as its inputs. Just remember to use the pure text name(s) there and not include any percentage % character.  Handy feature ;) And if you have more arrays just keep adding them on inside the paranthesis:  var all_files = files_in_A.concat(files_in_B,files_in_C,files_in_D,files_in_Y);      And of course the OP and anyone may ask why not use that method to begin with, and the answer is - while this method returns a truer 'random' it also uses more List Files Actions, pulls in more arrays and data, and has a larger data set.  Probably not a big deal, but still it's always better to minimize reading/writing and building large arrays when possible. Tasker isn't a SQL server lol."

Initially, I found the learning curve quite off-putting, so I ended up using Llama instead. I have now familiarised myself with Llama to the extent that I feel that I'm ready to move up a level, so to speak, and give Tasker a go. With Llama, I liked to have it read aloud my next timetabled events, through my calendar. I would do this by using the title of the event (e.g. ""Breakfast"") to change a variable ('ttb') to the word ""breakfast"". Llama then spoke the phrase ""Timetabled Event: ##ttb##', which, instead of saying ""hash hash tee tee bee hash hash"", would say ""breakfast"". I have not yet worked out how to replicate this functionality in Tasker, although I'm sure that it can be done. Any help would be much appreciated!"

It does wait 3 seconds, but then even if orientation returns to face-up before the 3 seconds are up, it still moves forward with hibernate.  I set profile ""A"" to detect face-down orientation, and when it does, it waits 3 seconds then sets variable = 1. On exit, it sets the variable = 2.  A second profile, ""B,"" looks for the variable = 1, and then hibernates.  I thought perhaps 3 seconds was too short a time for the exit action (set variable = 2) to work. So, I set it to 10 seconds to test. It still moves forward with the hibernate."

I have it so that the exit tasks are only done 5 minutes after the profile stops being active. This is so that I can pick up my phone and use it without the brightness being turned up.   You could do it with a much smaller timeout of 30 or 60 seconds. It sounds perfect for the job.   I do that by having the exit task wait before doing anything and then the start task checks to see if the exit task is running. If it is, it just kills the exit task and does nothing else."

It's just that the sheer number of variables AutoNotification returns is huuuge. (as I'm sure you've seen).  So the best way to find out is to basically create a 'Test Task' whereby you have that specific notification up in the Status Bar, then in the Test Task Just have two Actions:  AutoNotification > Query > By Title (enter the title, or query by maps package name etc.)  Set Clipboard >   Info Text: %aninfotext()  Text: %antext()  Text Big: %antextbig()  Text Lines: %antextlines()  Title Big: %antitlebig()  Tag: %antag()  Ticker: %anticker()   Button1 Text: %anbutton1text()  Button2 Text: %anbutton2text()  Button3 Text: %anbutton3text()      You can just copy/paste the above into your Set Clipboard Action. And then run the Task, and have a look in your Clipboard to see if the text you're looking for is in there. If it is, just reference the variable it corresponds to in order to pull it out.  Note: I'm running the beta of the newest AutoNotification, not sure if every one of those variables is available in other versions, but you'll find out soon enough ;)"
tasker,3cvd5j,fenchai,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"Well it all depends. Everytime an app updates there's a chance you'll have to change around your AutoInput Actions, some, or even all.   Because no matter what you choose be it Field ID, Text, X/Y Point, when the app updates that field name could change, the text you wanted to click could be different, or that point on the screen does nothing.  If your Task works up to a certain point, run it to that point, then use AutoInput Easy Setup to go back and click on whatever it is you want to click on, and set it up again, even if you have to choose a different method (i.e. clicking on a field id instead of text etc).  There's also the possibility that the screens changed in the app in such a way that AutoInput cannot 'see' them correctly, or at all. This often happens with pop-up menu's and overlays in certain apps. i.e. AutoInput can get up to a certain screen, then I'll have to click something by hand, and AutoInput then proceeds with the next bunch of Actions.   To do so, just set whatever AI Action comes after your manual click to have a longer timeout setting. That way AI will be 'waiting' for you to click on whatever it is, and then it will proceed along on its own again."

So your text file quotes.txt would look like:  Here is my first quote And then this is my second quote Third quote is on this line And so forth and so on      The use Read File to read in the file, and split it up, select a quote at random, and say it. So it would look like:  Read File: ""path/path/quotes.txt"" To Variable: %quotes  Variable Set: %ret Value: <press the return key here>  Variable Split Variable: %quotes Splitter: %ret  Variable Set: %length  Value: %quotes(#)  Variable Randomize - Variable Name: %rand  Min: 1  Max: %length  Variable Set: %quote_to_say  Value: %quotes(%rand)  Say: %quote_to_Say      Then setup a Profile based on Time, unclick the top and bottom time parts inside the Profile settings and just choose the middle 'repeat every' 30 minutes, link the Profile to the above Task."

tasker,3cnk7z,aleatorvb,2,Thu Jul 9 11:42:04 2015 UTC,"Javascript is in no way needed for this. Matching with Regex is a standard feature in Tasker, as well as the new AutoTools alpha plugin of even more advanced regex stuff.  So starting with basic tasker, I'm assuming that the YYY are numbers. Let's say your SMS data is in the variable %sms.  Just use:  Variable Search >   Variable: %sms   Search:   Rs[0-9]{1,3}\.   Store Matches In:  %my_numbers      After that, due to the limitations of Tasker's Search Replace, you're going to end up with those first 3 digits (or actually anything from 1-3 digits) prior to the decimal point in the variable %my_numbers along with the letters Rs.  So the only thing you need to do is in a 2nd action after the above do another Search this time using the replace feature to get rid of those letters Rs:  Variable Search >   Variable: %my_numbers   Search:   Rs   Replace Matches: <checked>   Replace With: <leave blank>      So now in two built-in Tasker Actions you've got your number(s) extraced into %my_numbers and of course you can name that variable whatever you want.          And if you want other value's out of that SMS - you'd just use the same procedure with a different regular expression, for example the available balance would be:  Bal-Rs[0-9]{0,3}(\,)?[0-9]{1,3}\.      You'd then just replace the ""Bal-Rs"" letters with nothing like above to get just the balance. You'll have to look into regular expression formatting to create them on your own without pulling your hair out lol, but for basic ones it's easy to ask on the forum here.     EDIT: See you 'solved' it using a bunch of splits, which yes will work, until, they change the formatting of that message in even the slightest, then you'll have to start from scratch. With the regular expressions you might have change a letter or two or often nothing at all."

I'm reasonably sure Bluetooth has to be on to be able to use Bluetooth Near, anyway, so trying to turn it on with a trigger that required it to already be on will be a bit circular :-)  Yeah, the only time I turn Bluetooth off is when it connects to something automatically and I want to make it stop easily.  EDIT: Apparently BT Near can be used with Bluetooth disabled. You need to tick the box labeled ""Toggle Bluetooth"". What will happen is, if Bluetooth is disabled, it will periodically be enabled, a scan will be done, and then it will disable itself again. The period for BT scanning is specified in Menu / Preferences / Monitor / BT Scan Time. The default period seems to be 120s. So that means if you have this task enabled, Bluetooth will turn on every 2 minutes, scan, and turn off again.

tasker,3ch7xs,EllaTheCat,4,Tue Jul 7 21:58:18 2015 UTC,"Ooooo YEah. Great idea!!! And I have some refinements  So I'll lay it out and you can extract whichever piece(s) work for you. First off nice catch for realizing the offline voice recognition can work in composing a text.  However, there's no reason to send SMS's to yourself. Keep your phone in Airplane Mode if you want, and I'll save you 1,000 text messages lol. First off, if you're using AutoVoice - I assume you have AutoInput, if not - get it.  Then all you need (again extract as you wish) is one Task, and one Scene.  In the Task, it just opens the SMS window, with a nonsense phone number so that the message field has focus. It also pops up a little Scene (place it where you want it) that just has a Red and Green button, or whatever you want.  Then you've just gotta click the mic button on the keyboard by hand to start the voice input, unless you're rooted - in which case I think you can run a command to click this key.  As soon as you're done speaking, just click the Green Scene button, and that buttons's Action then - gets rid of the Scene, uses AutoInput to   AutoInput > Config> Action > Select > Focus     then   AutoInput > Config > Action > Cut > Focus       and all your spoken text is NOW IN THE CLIPBOARD. I think you can see where this is going...  Then just have a Wait for 1-3 seconds to make sure the text cut into to clipboard is complete (time may differ depending on your device) then immediately from there you ""Perform Task"" your Task/Actions that uses the AutoVoice text as you've been doing, without the need to send yourself texts over and over.  In that 'final destination' Task you can either use %CLIP as the text to use, or if you want to get technical in case you've got other clipboard stuff going on, or Wait times in that normally AutoVoice linked Task, etc. I would recommend in the ""Perform Task"" Action send over %CLIP inside %par1 over to its destination. That way the words you just spoke are piped right into their destination Task.     START TASK  SCENE RED GREEN  GREEN BUTTON ACTIONS  PIC OF HALFWAY THROUGH IT'S ACTIONS     And as far as that Red Button - just have it Hide/Destroy the Scene as sort of a 'cancel' if you change your mind during the SMS compose.   The AI>Global>Back Actions at the end are in there to back you out of the SMS messaging app to the homescreen or wherever. Again configure as you wish :)  Think this works quite well!!          Additional options:  As some even other alternatives to be considered, if you wanted to NOT use AutoInput and don't mind an extra click or so, after you've used Tasker to open your SMS app and spoken your text into the message field, just manually Select All text in the msg field, Copy (or Cut) by hand, and setup a Tasker Profile to watch for it:  You'd have to preface your 'voice commands' with keywords and strip them later, so for example lets assume that all your messages will begin with ""Tasker command"" etc. words  etc.  And you can either speak the words ""Tasker command"" or pre-populate it into the Message field inside your Compose SMS Action. Then just setup a Profile in Tasker to watch for the following:  Event > Variable Set >   Variable: %CLIP    Value: Tasker Command*      And of course that asterisk just matches anything following that. And link that Profile to your Task(s) that are going to make use of the spoken text. Just use Variable Search/Replace to remove the ""Tasker command"" words from the beginning of the text, if you need to.  As another alternative on the 'finish-up side' if you are going to be using AutoInput and don't want to use a Scene, there's plenty of other options such as having a Notification appear up in the bar to click on when you've finished speaking, that will run the Select/Cut/Perform Task/etc.  Or to get really snazzy if you've got the AutoApps subscription and have checked out AutoBubble, rather than a Scene you can popup a dragable/movable icon that you can click on when you're done, and that way if you switch to landscape mode you've got a bit more control over the controls, lol. However - even with the Scene, if you position it correctly the transition to landscape will still keep it in a good place.   Of course you wanted quick AND dirty so there's options with AutoBubble icons ;)"

I pretty much figured it was going to be device/app specific, so I tried to toss around all the options so to speak, and whichever method works best, or just works period, is what you go with.  Interesting that AutoInput can't/won't select the text in your messaging app?? It still may be able to actually, with one more AI Action at the start of that process.  And that would be:  AutoInput > Action > Focus > Field ID (or text)      Basically that Action would first put focus on the messaging field, and AI can then 'select' followed by 'cut' etc. If you use AI's Easy Setup feature and go over to your messaging app and click on the message field where the text you spoke shows up - AI should give you the field ID.  On my Note 4 with stock messenger that field is:  com.android.mms:id/edit_text_bottom      So the AI config screen would look like this.  If for some reason that doesn't work with the Field ID, and you're willing to preface your voice commands with some specific text like ""Tasker command"", then instead - use the AI > Action > Focus > Text should work to designate that text to focus on.  Tested both methods, both work on my device/app. Give it a try if you'd like."

You can than tap your buttons and whatever happens, and when when you tap somewhere not a button something else will happen."

Don't know much on Python or Hexchat, but I know Tasker fairly well ;)  So if you can hack your way through all this to the point where you can AutoRemote the data to your device and parse it to run a Task, just create a Task that sets a notification.  In Tasker itself there's Actions for Notify, Notify Vibrate, Notify etc. to do some standard basic notifications up in the bar. If you need infinite flexibility download/use AutoNotification. It uses the same command system syntax as AR and the other AutoApps i.e. foo=:=bar   Anyways to further this along, I would ask two questions:   In what format are you sending the data back through AutoRemote, what does it look like etc like say ""my cats names are=:=bob,fluffy,arial"" With the data that's coming back, what Task are you running now based on that data? And what do you want to use the Notification for and what should that notification be looking like? Both in UI and functionality.   And with that there's a whole slew of solutions available for making Notifications."

tasker,3ci2d3,Ratchet_Guy,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"Alright, so before the AutoRemote data gets sent over, prefix the data on the sending side with:  HexchatData=:=  so it would like in the AutoRemote log...  HexchatData=:=gonzobot duck dynasty 1911 blah la la la      Then in Tasker setup a Profile:  Profile > Event > AutoRemote > Config > Message Filter >    ^HexchatData.*  Regex Field - Checked      Then link to your Task, and in the Task, just for testing put an Action  Action > Alert > Flash > %ancomm      Whereby %ancomm represents everything to the right of the =:= which in this case is all your Hexchat stuff. Flash will show it on your screen briefly so each time it shows up you'll see it and know the Profile/Task is working correctly.  Then you can use %ancomm however you want in whatever Task(s) you link to that Profile. It is a string value by default and AutoRemote handles all the URL encoding/decoding for you, so it's ready to go right off the bat."

Tasker can see the name of every window opened, and typically when the Notification Bar is expanded, it has it's own window name. On my device that is ""Notification shade."" It may differ on yours. Firstly the Profile to act on it would look like:  Profile > Event > Variable Set   Variable: %WIN   Value: Notification shade.      Link that to whatever Task you want to run when the notiication bar opens. If that doesn't work on your device since likely Tasker see a different window name, in order to get the window name, setup a test Profile of:  Profile > Event > Variable Set   Variable: %WIN   Value: [leave blank]  Link to Task:  Alert > Flash > %WIN   and/or Set Clipboard > %WIN      Then exit Tasker and expand your Notification Bar and it should Flash (and/or copy to the clipboard) the exact name of the 'window' Tasker sees when your bar is expanded."

tasker,3ceplt,Morzanhu,2,Tue Jul 7 09:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You just need to an element in the scene that can detect a swipe, like an image, or a shape (rectangle). You'll see the swipe/stroke at the far right of the element config when you're in it.  If you want it to detect it anywhere in the scene, that element just needs to be the shape of the whole scene. I use this quite often to display images or notifications and then act on them in different way based on direction swiped.  To make it happen, once you're in that config tab, there's a list where you add Actions you want Tasker to perform when the swipe happens. At the top you can select the swipe direction, and the minimum amount of pixels the swipe need to occur for in that direction for the chosen Actions to run.  If you select Direction > Any the corresponding Actions will on any swipe, or, to specify further you'll have to add 'IF' conditions to your Actions if you want to detect up to 8 different directions etc.  The inputted swiped direction is automatically made available in a Tasker variable named %stroke_dir whose values can be one of the following eight:  %stroke_dir Up Down Left Right UpRight UpLeft  DownRight DownLeft      And those are the values you'd use, and you can see the 'diagonal' directions are in there. So if you want to Spotify to Play when you swipe up and to the right, you'd add an Action:  Media Controls > Spotify > Play  IF %stroke_dir eq UpRight"

tasker,3cfvjo,Freakooo90,2,Tue Jul 7 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"From what I understand in the latest version(s) of Spotify, what you see up there is technically a widget of sorts.   The AutoNotification beta can control all its buttons, which is really cool. Even if the screen is off. However then Tasker got updated with app-specific media controls, and those work just as well.  So, the best way to get the current coverart to put in a Scene etc. is to download Media Utilities if for nothing but the fact that it always manages (on most devices) to catch the Cover Art in Spotify.  On my device it lives in this path:  /sdcard/Pictures/mu_coverart/mu_coverart_current.jpg      And as long as I have that in a Scene Image Element that's showing, within seconds of Spotify moving on to the next song, the Scene updates and shows the current coverart."

I guess just outline more what's going on and what you're trying to do etc.  Or even what your Profile looks like now, as the Event for AutoBubble in a Profile only deals with receiving an AutoBubble command.

So you should Flash %TRUN and see if your Task is still running lol. Sounds funny but it's the truth, from what's been discussed on this forum anyways.  So to do what you want to do, you really want to have a Profile, with multiple contexts. So you have an Event or State of Display>Off and then you can add a time context to the Profile (by long clicking on the first context) and then add whatever time frame(s) you want it to be active in.  Wait Until has its uses, but this here likely wouldn't be one of them."

I was thinking it would keep checking the length of time you set for the screen to go off (in this case) and then stop checking. Of course I was hoping when I first tried it out to just wait forever until the screen turned off, then do the rest of the task and quit checking.   Anyway, I just went back to how I had it before, an if statement at the beginning to check that the screen is off and then a three minute wait in the else block, with a goto the first action. Won't be as quick to run than I was hoping the wait until would be, but I don't really want it running every time I turn the screen off so I don't want that as a profile state.   Thanks again for the explanation and tips."
tasker,3cdtjz,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:44:49 2015 UTC,"Hey!!  So, the most accurate answer is somewhere in between the two Actions (Wait vs. Wait Until) in that you'd just have to build your own custom Wait Loop.  So if you wanted to check every 5 minutes for up to 1 Hour if the screen has turned off:  FOR %repeats ITEMS: 1:12   WAIT 5 Minutes   GOTO <Action Number or Label of next thing> IF %SCREEN eq off END FOR      Note that in the above the %repeats variable above doesn't get utilized in this specific case, it's just there counting to itself from 1 to 12 (as 12 iterations times 5 minutes equals 60 minutes total, whereby it give up counting and moves on)."
tasker,3cdtjz,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:19:33 2015 UTC,"Man, you teach me more about Tasker than I probably ever would learn on my own.   I set up a task just now to test the for loop and didn't have a wait, but I just made it vibrate for 50ms. It only vibrated once. But if I add a wait longer than 10ms it vibrates 10 times like I set up. Any idea why this is? I thought it would just vibrate for longer with maybe a little gap in between (without the wait)."
tasker,3cdtjz,friedchocolatesoda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"Glad to be of assistance ;)  On testing the FOR Action like this, the loop moves fast. So if there's no Wait time (and even 10ms is pretty short) there wouldn't be a gap, unless you create the gap with the Wait statement.   If there was automatically some kind of gap in between, it would mean Tasker was moving really slow in running through that loop. The way Tasker (or anything program related) should work is that it doesn't do anything that you don't tell it to.  There's exceptions of course, in that some Actions that Tasker runs might take some period of time to execute, and that will hold up the loop."
tasker,3cdtjz,UnkleMike,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:19 2015 UTC,"Ohhh I wasn't even thinking about it still being vibrating and not adding the extra time on to the end, but resetting, so to speak. Like, if it takes 2 ms to run the loop it doesn't take the 48 ms left and add 50 ms, but rather resets it to 50 ms. So repeating ten times doesn't make a noticeable difference, where fifty or one hundred times (which I just tested) does last longer like I expected."
tasker,3cdtjz,UnkleMike,2,Tue Jul 7 15:00:14 2015 UTC,It waits for ___ amount of time and then does the next step. So for you it would wait for one hour and then check if %SCREEN is off.

tasker,3cd88m,TremendoSlap,3,Tue Jul 7 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"Lol, excellent analogy.  And yes, this is the correct answer. Intents are very random in how/if they work, and often time to get them correct you need to contact the app developer and/or have access to really good API info on it, where you can see what Intents do what.  The problem is also in formatting Data and Extras. I often use Intents to 'start' some kind of app/process, then use AutoInput from there to move around and click on what's needed.  Google ""Tasker Intents"" and there's a lot to read, but try putting some of it to use - and you'll see why AutoInput is sometimes the quicker/easier way to go."

It lets you setup a Profile with Plugin > AutoNotification > Intercept. You'd choose Hangouts as the App, and then choose ""Cancelled"" At which point anytime the PC sync's up and your phone dismisses the notification, whatever Task you link to this Profile will happen, namely the Task that reset the Zooper color.          Search Play Store for: AutoNotification Plugin  If you haven't used any of the AutoApps there's alot of tutorials on the main JoaoApps site, and rather than just getting one plugin at a time, I suggest the 'subscription' and for $1/month you get everything this guy makes, which is dozens of plugins, including alpha/beta with extended functions."

I set up my profile like you said with a bit exception: I modified Notification text into: Multiple Languages - SwiftKey Keyboard and checked the ""Exact"" field: ""Check to match only exactly what you wrote"". On purpose I installed SwiftKey and it acts like this...I enter PlayStore, try to search for something, the profile triggers but it is triggered many times(many alerts). I exit PlayStore and it alerts again on the launcher or...an even more annoying thing...while I'm on Playstore, the caret blinking and my keyboard already on the screen...if I press again on that searchfield in the Playstore, it triggers the profile again and again which means alert...wait 1/4 seconds...alert...wait..alert and so on! You got the idea. Another annoying thing...within all those fields for setting the autonotification intercept state there are fields like:  Apps: Choose which apps' notifications you want to intercept and when I choose SwiftKey from the list, the profile no longer works and I don't *kin' understand why, sorry for my language...the same thing happens when you choose apps's package which is com.touchtype.swiftkey.  As for the above situation I'm not disturbed because of this thing : ""while I'm on Playstore, the caret blinking and my keyboard already on the screen...if I press again on that searchfield in the Playstore, it triggers the profile again and again which means alert...wait 1/4 seconds...alert...wait..alert and so on"" but for the second problem : ""I exit PlayStore and it alerts again on the launcher"". Imagine I will have an enter/exit task. I enter playstore, my keyboard is shown, profile triggered..I unfocus keyboard-> exit task executes(as normal). It never happened to me that exit task be executed many times but after the enter task completed...then exit task executed and then enter task executed again even though I wasn't focused on any textfield...I don't get it! I exit playstore(physical home button) enter task executes again and of course exit task...which is not good at all. I want to obtain this effect! I focus any textfield in any app-> profile triggered and stays active as long as my keyboard is still shown( as far as I know, the notification related to keyboard on-screen in the notification panel stays active as long as the keyboard is shown)...Then why...if notification is no longer there(In the notification panel), the profile still triggers by itself?? I want this: Focus on textfield, keyboard shown(android thing)...wait a few seconds then kill Swapps so my shown keyboard could not interfere with swapps's ActiveSpot...restart Swapps 5 seconds after I unfocused textfield and keyboard is no longer shown( notification no longer present)...I'm sure you got the point...maybe you could give me a hint around this because I got my remove at AutoNotification thing :)...thanks a lot!!

Events should happen only once. making it to kill the swapps only on notification creation should force it to do it only when you open the keyboard. starting the app when the notification is cancelled. making the if statement to check if the previous profile is active makes sure that it wont restart the swapps while it is running.  the notification text should have .* , then no spaces or anything a word your keyboard shows on that field (there is the little notification that allows you to change keyboards)  Feel free to ask more questions and respond if that worked."

tasker,3c672z,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jul 5 13:14:01 2015 UTC,"You absolutely can detect how long you hold down a volume button for!!  Just use AutoInput Key Input in a Profile, as it can detect both 'key down' and 'key up' events. So basically when you press the Volume key down, you run a Task that logs the current time in a Global Variable say %StartTime, using %TIMES or %TIMEMS  Then another Profile that detects when the volume key is let up, that again sets something like %nowtime to again %TIMES or %TIMEMS.  The use:  Set Variable %difference = %nowtime - %StartTime      And the result is the exact time you held the button down for. So the whole thing is but a two Profiles and a few Actions:  Profile > AutoInput Key > Volume Up Key > Down Press    Task: Variable Set %StartTime Value: %TIMES    Profile > AutoInput Key > Volume Up Key > Up / Released    Task: Variable Set %nowtime Value: %TIMES    Variable Set %difference Value: %nowtime - %StartTime Do Maths: On    Alert > Flash ""The button was held down for %difference seconds."""

tasker,3c29n4,hylian122,2,Sat Jul 4 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"This actually all can be done, so lets take it a step a time. If you want to just display a single name of a single article in the Zooper widget, you're not going to need any Arrays.  Basically just create a Zooper widget, probable 4x2 would suffice. Add a text field/object inside Zooper (Layout > + > Text). Put some text in it (where in Zooper it says 'Edit Text Manually') like ""MY TEST TEXT"" in order to position it in Zooper on the screen where you want it, get the color and font in Zooper to your liking, all that stuff.  Now to see real quick how Tasker sets Zooper info/vars, create a Tasker Task with a single Action>Plugin>Zooper and in there set a Zooper Variable named ""POCKETVAR"" to value ""Here is Text From Tasker"". Will look like this.  You'll see when you click the Save (upper right) it will take you back to the Config screen where you'll see Tasker showing you #TPOCKETVAR# = Here is Text from Text, like this. Zooper plugin in Tasker adds that ""T"" to designate an external variable being sent over from Tasker. And the hashtags are just Zooper's variable format. For example:  Tasker uses - %VARIABLE_NAME   Zooper uses - #TVARIABLE_NAME#       And those hash tag marks are how Zooper designates all its variables. (rather than the leading % sign in Tasker):  Now - run the Tasker Task that has this one Action. Nothing will happen you can immediately see, but what it did was to set #TPOCKETVAR# in Zooper to your text ""Here is Text Text from Tasker"".  To see it in Zooper, go out of Tasker back to the Zooper widget config, and back into that text field you created to get the positioning and color the way you wanted it. Go back into ""Edit Text Manually"" and instead of the text you had typed before, change it to   #TPOCKETVAR#      And immediately upon typing that in, you should see that text you set in Tasker magically appear in Zooper. Because you previously ran that Task in Tasker it sent that varname and value over to Zooper. As an analogy -  Zooper now has a Global Var named #TPOCKETVAR# that you can not only use in THAT Zooper widget, but in any Zooper widget anywhere on your homescreens in the future. Zooper retains that value even after reboot, etc. Just like Tasker holds Tasker Global Variable names and values.       From here I think you can figure out the rest of your 'display in Zooper part'. In Tasker, get your data from IFTTT formatted the way you want it text-wise for display in Zooper, and in the Plugin>Zooper config in Tasker, rather than type in the text as you did in the example, set the value part to %my_pocket_data where that variable name represent whatever name you're going to be using. So in Tasker Zooper config screen you'll see something like this pic and like this pic.  To later clear the text being displayed in Zooper (display nothing) just set the value inside Tasker to blank. Quickest way would be to Variable Clear %my_pocket_data then run your Task/Action again that sets that Zooper var, and it will set it to empty.  After you get this part/stuff implemented, we can move on to how you can click on the Zooper widget text to open the article.."

I think I understand what you've got so far, but that will just show the name of the most recent article, right? Is there any way to show all of them in a list?"
tasker,3c29n4,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sat Jul 4 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Very welcome, and in order to display a list, due to the limitations of the Zooper plugin in Tasker, you'll need a separate Tasker Zooper Action for each. Which is no big deal really. You're just going to see a bunch of Zooper plugin actions one after the other in your Task.  An array might come into play here, depending on how the data is coming back from IFTTT. Is IFTTT currently sending you multiple article titles, and if so, in what format? Or would have to AutoRemote request IFTTT say 5 times in a row to get 5 article titles back?  Regardling arrays, just think of each array like a separate shopping cart ""item"". You go the market, one by one you add items to the cart, each item has it's own numbered slot.   Try it in Tasker by setting up three Action one after the other, each that says Variables>Array Push and each time use:  Array Push %Cart Position:1 Value: apples  Array Push %Cart Position: 2 Value: bananas  Array Push %Cart Position: 3 Value: grapes      Now what you're going to have, if you go into the ""Vars"" Tab in Tasker is see:  %Cart1 = apples  %Cart2 = bananas  %Cart3 = grapes      You see the whole array at once by at the end of the above Task add an Alert > Flash > %Cart()  Those doubles parenthesis at the end means ""Show me all the values"". Now keep adding Flash Actions one after the other:  Action > Alert > Flash > %Cart1  Flash > %Cart2  Flash > %Cart3      And one by one you'll see Tasker Flash ""apples"" then ""bananas"" then ""grapes"". And that's ""Arrays 101 Lesson"" lol.  To remove an item from the cart, you'd use Array>Pop>%Cart1 whereby again the number 1 designating it's the first position in the Array. In the ""Pop"" Action it give you the option to Pop it out into a variable name, so if you used:  Array Pop > %Cart1 To Value: %fruit  Alert > Flash %fruit   It's going to Flash ""apples"" because you took apples out of %Cart (position 1) and put into %fruit.   So if IFTTT is going to return a bunch of results, setup a Task to Push them into an array one at a time, like  %IFTTT_titles and then if you got 5 articles, setup 5 Tasker Actions to use the Zooper plugin and set   #ARTICLE1# = %IFTTT_titles1  #ARTICLE2# = %IFTTT_titles2  etc. etc.      And that's it. You won't have to Pop the values here, just reference them as above code. You're basically just 'pointing' to an item in the array. ""Hey Zooper! Look at item number 2"" so to speak.  Also, in your initial post you mentioned %article(2) with the parenthesis. You CAN use this format in Tasker, and it is 'PROPER' format programming wise. For example I almost always would use %Cart(1) %Cart(2) just because I can see it better and also because having programmed in other languages I've never seen array values without a delimiter like %Cart[1] etc. etc. So if you want you could use:  #ARTICLE1# = %IFTTT_titles(1)  #ARTICLE2# = %IFTTT_titles(2)  etc. etc      Just make sure in Zooper you've got 5 separate text fields setup, each one to hold #ARTICLE1# #ARTICLE2# etc. (As a side note you're not building an array in Zooper, just making up names, Zooper doesn't do arrays). So you could just as easily use #ARTICLE_UNO# and #ARTICLE_DOS# etc etc"
tasker,3c29n4,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"Oh perfect! That's much easier than I thought and I think will help me understand arrays better going forward. IFTTT does send titles one at a time so this will work.   Last question (for now), how can I ""pop"" out a variable from the array based on its content? For example, if I archive an article in Pocket, IFTTT will send its name to AutoRemote again. Can I use that to pop out that particular Variable? Presumably pushing everything up a slot before pushing it all to Zooper again."
tasker,3c29n4,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Cool!  And yes you can pop out based on value by first asking Tasker to give you the array position number. For reference on all array functions (Which can be a little cryptic in Tasker, and even the examples are cryptic) check out the verrry bottom of this page - http://tasker.dinglisch.net/userguide/en/variables.html  To the specific question of the position number based on value you would use format %Cart(#?bananas) which basically says ""Query %Cart for the array number position of bananas. Like:  Variable Set: %position = %Cart(#?bananas)    <Which would return to you the Value of 2 based on the above example, and then you could use:>  Array Pop > Position: %position      And that's it. Of course in your case the Article Title's going to be longer than ""banans"" so its going to look like:  Variable Set: %position = %IFTTT_titles(#?Your article title text here)    Array Pop > %IFTTT_titles Position %position      EDIT: Note that pattern matching can also be used in that 'find array pos' function, so you wouldn't need the whole article title. Like if you had the in %Cart2 the text ""I really like bananas and stuff"". You could use:  Variable Set > %position Value: %Cart(#?*bananas*)      Which would still return the value 2, since ""bananas"" appears somewhere in the wording of that array value. If there are more than one array value(s) that match %position will return a comma separated list of the array values, which is something to watch out for. Like if you had article titles containing lots of similar words and you used the pattern matching. Best to just specify the exact title of the article if you can."

Once you get that data/information, someone here can tell you how to send it with Tasker. I took a look at that manual, didn't see anything in there about Http Post.  Also that app you mentioned on the play store can control the volume yes? By pressing something on the screen (like up/down buttons)? You can use AutoInput plugin in Tasker to press just about anything, so you'd have Tasker open that app and then AutoInput would click volume up/down. Might even work with the screen off."

That number is only useful for a limited time, so in order for it to be insecure they need to not only hear that code being read aloud, but also already know your password or be able to crack it faster than the code expires (unlikely but not impossible)   Overall, that's pretty safe.

tasker,3bzwew,Ratchet_Guy,3,Fri Jul 3 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"So, I'll start :)  I have a million different ones but one that is very useful is if I can't find my phone because it's sitting around somewhere, underneath a pile of papers, or it fell in the couch, etc. - I use AutoRemote in my Chromebook to send an AR command to the phone AR_do=:=LOCATE  And then the Task turns off Bluetooth (in case phone is connected to a speaker or a headset/phones), then sets volume to maximum, and plays a loud sound.   It also uses AutoNotification to put a notification in the status bar so that when I find the phone (which usually happens quickly) I just pull down the notification and click it to stop the loud sound playing, and cancel the notification.  Also, if the loud sound goes off and I realize that it's fairly nearby and I remember where I put it, and I don't feel like getting up and going over to where I know it is know to manually shut off the loud 'find me' sound I have a command on my Chromebook setup to send AR_do=:=CANCEL_LOCATE and it runs the routine as if I'd went over to the phone (stops that sound from playing, etc.)  If I happen to be OUTSIDE of the house, I have the same setup that will trigger on receipt of a certain text message (which is handled by Tasker) but also on receipt of a Gmail or anything else that shows a notification in the status bar, and have AutoNotification Intercept watching for certain text that shows up in the Notification. Note even though you can't often see say the body of an email/Gmail in the notification bar, it's still up there somewhere an as AutoNotification can 'see' every field of a notification hidden from visual view or not, it can still trigger."

tasker,3bzqco,brodie7838,4,Fri Jul 3 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll start by answering my own question from last week.  I was looking for a way to use an Android App's Icon in a status bar notification, whether using Tasker's Notify or AutoNotification.  Neither gives the option by default to browse to application icons. So where is the path to each app's icon? The quickest way I found out how to get it was to go into Scene > Add Image and then in the image selector it lets you choose an Application Icon. Then when you've chosen one and it shows up in the config screen, click the 'switch to variable' button, and by default the path to the icon then appears in the text field - so cut/copy that text path and just cancel out of the Scene. (The Scene has no relevance other than to get this info).  So then you can go back to AutoNotification and create notifications that look like these:  http://i.imgur.com/hSkb7h2.png  http://i.imgur.com/mWekKwK.png  And the code/path to each app image seems rather unique, as in there's no formula for it even if you know the package name:  AVIARY: android.resource://com.aviary.android.feather/drawable/new_app_icon  STANDARD MESSAGING APP: android.resource://com.android.mms/drawable/2130903040  S-NOTE: android.resource://com.samsung.android.snote/drawable/ic_launcher      Maybe there's an easier way, but this is what I've been using. Also as a note Tasker's 'Notify' Action doesn't let you place the above text into the field even if you switch to the variable text entry, however AutoNotifcation DOES, and AutoNotification is what I've been using to create notifications like those referenced in the above images.      EDIT: Answering my own question, there IS another way to do this, using AutoLaunch plugin, and using AutoLaunch > Query. And from that you'll get back the variable %anicon() which has the path to the app's icon your queried for. However the path leads to a file somewhere in a JoaoApps subfolder, so I'm not sure if AN copies it there after running the Query or what, so I'd say this is another option that's viable if you have AN installed."

As far as sending out of Hangouts as a Hangout message, that is a little more difficult.  I guess you could do it with Autoinput but the position of the contacts changes.  I used to use Autocontacts to determine the contact's Hangout id #, then with Tasker I could Send Intent and open up Hangouts to that contact.  I would use Type to write out the message, maybe coming from a variable for instance.  Then I just had to manually hit send but Autoinput could cover that.

The Activity and GeoFence monitor use hardly any battery, less than 1%.  But that Location monitor is going to be your best friend in this case.  The only hangup I can think of is that getting the distance between two points is going to give you Google Map's representation.  So if you took route B instead of route A than your trip-o-meter could be off.  Unless you take a reading every 'x' seconds and then just keep adding that to a grand total.  Because if you didn't do that if you went a negative distance you'd still be adding that to the total traveled.  But just using two points the distance traveled would change because the route may have gotten closer to the origin.  I think you see where I'm getting at.

Name the task if you want.  In the task screen add an action of Alert / Flash. In the Text put %WIN, or select Window Label from the drop down list. Done. Back all the way out.  You'll see that every new app or window you open will flash up its name. Great, but then straight after it'll flash ""home"", which is annoying. This is Lollipop being bad.  You can put some ""do x if %WIN={an app}"" statements in there, then ""do y if %WIN="" Home"" and it'll have the effect you're after, but you'll need to ignore the "" Home"" if it happens less than 1 sec after the {an app}.

tasker,3bvfvn,Ratchet_Guy,2,Fri Jul 3 20:38:28 2015 UTC,This is a known problem with Tasker on Lollipop. You can find it on the Tasker guide.  I have no clue whether or not it's fixable. There are certain ways you can try to get around it using more complicated profiles and checks using AutoInput or whatnot but unfortunately it seems like that's what we're stuck with unless you want to revert to KitKat (which I did).
tasker,3bvfvn,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"I think this may be launcher related. I've always used Nova and this has been broken for me since Lollipop, but I've just tried two random launchers off the Store, and the per-app profiles worked fine.  Shame I'm committed to Nova.  Just tried Apex launcher - works fine. Is Nova the culprit??"
tasker,3bvfvn,fenchai,2,Fri Jul 3 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"First thought is to go to any Profile you're having this problem with, and long click on the Profile name. Then click the Profile Settings button (little slider icon).  Scroll down and if you see a checkbox labelled ""Restore Settings"" UN-check it. Tasker typically set this to checked by default which accounts for all sorts of conflict and IMO should be reserved for Beginner Mode for it to be checked by default.  In a nutshell when checked Tasker automatically flips back a certain category of settings like auto-rotate and volume and a bunch of other stuff, over-riding some Actions you've set to have things remain a specific way."
tasker,3bvfvn,fenchai,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"That sort of helped. I have an exit task on that profile that is supposed to turn auto rotate off. This solution only seems to work if I get rid of the exit task. But then I have no way of automatically turning off auto rotate when I'm done with those apps. I tried making a profile that turns auto rotate off whenever I'm NOT in those apps, but that seems to be interfering in such a way that puts me right back where I started. Any thoughts?"
tasker,3bvs5z,last1left91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about setting AutoRotate on or off somewhere outside of Tasker, then the answer is likely nothing direct. You could setup a Profile that triggers based on time every couple of minutes (or whatever timeframe works for you), that is linked to a Task that does the Test Display Action and sets the notification as you'd like.  The other way, and IMO the better way, is to Toggle AutoRotate mainly using Tasker. Just setup a Task that is   NAME: ""Toggle Auto Rotate""  Display > AutoRotate > Toggle  Display > Test Display > AutoRotate  <BASED ON RESULT SET DESIRED NOTIFICATION HERE>        Then just drop a shortcut to that Task on your homescreen, then everytime you click it, it toggles it, and updates the notification as to what the status is. In fact this is probably quicker than toggling AutoRotate from anywhere else on the device.  I actually really like this idea, think I'm going to throw a shortcut on my homescreen for this :)"

Everyday of the week I run a task that pulls out stock data from yahoo finance API and performs a bunch of calculations then sends me a report on those stocks via email and WhatsApp. Because the stocks can be in any market around the world it's important to run the task once the last relevant market has closed (New York). I also travel a lot and often find myself in Hong Kong where due to time difference it is well into the following day by the time the task runs. I use %DATE and related variables throughout the task and being in the Asia time zone throws off the reporting as the financial data is for the previous day but the report suggests it is for the current day. Having 2 actions, one to switch my phone to US East time zone at the start and one to switch back at the end to my current time zone wherever that may be, would really solve this issue.   Hope this clarifies. Thanks in advance."
tasker,3bvio1,sid32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:42:54 2015 UTC,Can you copy the task and use timezone set as a trigger? Or location?
tasker,3bvio1,sid32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:49:04 2015 UTC,changing the time zone to US East is Easy through Action System > Set time zone. That gets me the right date for my reports.

tasker,3bssg5,plepleus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:20:30 2015 UTC,Is there any chance you can explain how this works exactly?
tasker,3bssg5,redditorfromwork,3,Fri Jul 3 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  In reddit, as you know, you can sort subreddits by new/top/hot and then by time 1hr/24hr/month/etc.. So in step A1 we request the url for the top post in the last day (i.e. 24hrs).  You can see that in the ?sort=top&t=day portion.  Now there is a difference with the added .json.  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a different way to return data.  If, in step A1, we didn't use the .json we would get the normal html file that we look at on reddit.  This is fine for a browser, but it is difficult to extract the data.  This is where JSON comes in, it returns an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs.  This makes parsing the returned data much easier.  So back to the task.  Step A1 requests the json data from reddit and stores the result in the global variable %HTTPD.  Step A2 is just setting an iterator to 0 so we can look at the different reddit posts returned and stored in %HTTPD.  Step A3 is a parsing of the json step.  Javascript has a builtin JSON.parse() function that makes parse json data super easy.  The global('HTTPD') is how we get global Tasker variables into the JavaScript(let)s.  So in this step we are looking to see if the post is tagged as NSFW.  That is the data.children[itr].data.over_18 (you can also check if it is a self post from one of my other comments in this post) portion of this step.  You may ask how do we figure out how to get the data.children[itr].data.over_18.  Well, JSON is a structured documents with various nested curly brackets ({}) and square brackets ([]).  Based on the structure we can figure out how deep to go into the tree.  Here is more details on JSON.  So each step deeper into the tree relates to a period (.) in the parse instruction.  In this example, data is the most outside key name and then children[] is an array with all the reddit post data.  Where itr is our iterator starting at 0, the top post. Within each children[] array is more data, and then we can get various things from there such is the over_18 or is_self.  These chains/trees converted into the simple JSON parse format can be a pain to figure out.  This is the returned JSON from the example.  Look how messy that is.  So /u/Ratchet_Guy and I worked on a way to make this easier.  Okay, back to the task.  Step A3 has var nsfw = for setting a variable on whether the post is nsfw or not.  This variable can be used in tasker as %nsfw.  Steps A4 and A5 check whether the post is nsfw with the If [ %nsfw ~ true ] and if it is we add 1 to the iterator %itr (to get the next post) and go back to step A3 to check if the next post is nsfw.  This loop continues until we find a sfw post.  In Step A6 we do another JSON parse to get the originally submitted url for the post and store it in the variable %url which can be used in the task to send it off.  I hope this helps explain it.  Let me know if you have any other questions."

tasker,3bpzfc,Ratchet_Guy,4,Wed Jul 1 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, I should add a feature in AutoTools that, given a name, it would return all the ""paths"" for that name.   For example in your spotify URL, giving it ""height"", it would return       ""albums.items.images.height""  Also, I could have an option that if selected you could simply get the field ""height"" and it would automatically get all the fields called ""height"" no matter where they are. In most JSON files this would probably be enough :)  Let me know what you think"
tasker,3bpzfc,joaomgcd,2,Wed Jul 1 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"I think that would be great! The more ways to find the data (and paths to) the better when sometimes there's just so much of it, and it's nested in all those objects :)  It also lessens the learning curve for folks who want to start pulling in data via JSON but aren't quite sure how to set the paths, especially when, expounding on your example, the word 'height' may appear in multiple paths.  And then by returning 'all the paths' the user could choose the right one, seeing clearly where the path to the height of the album image differs from say the one to the artist photo, etc."

tasker,3bpzfc,plepleus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"If you run this combination of tasks you'll see that it runs extremely slowly.  That's because it uses recursion (in other words when, in this case, the task calls itself).  So for the task to get (from the Spotify example) albums.href.items[0].external_urls.spotify it is actually simultaneously running 5 instances of itself.  There is a little bit of ""bad programming"" in the task as well because Java has the concept of try{}catch{} which tries some function and catches an error. However, Tasker has no such thing so in the JSONArray section, we had to add a ""Continue After Error"" and a second check if a variable is set or not to handle this.  Both these issues (speed and errors) would be resolved using Java and from the other comments it looks like /u/joaomgcd is working on incorporating it into AutoTools."
tasker,3bpzfc,joaomgcd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:20:55 2015 UTC,Check my replies :) Already done.
tasker,3bpzfc,joaomgcd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:23:00 2015 UTC,"This is really great. Well done!!  To show an example of useful this can be, I'll again use Spotify as an example, and first even say why Spotify is one of my favorite examples - a lot of people don't often realize that Spotify is a SERVICE first, and an APP second. Just the fact that Spotify created their Android 'front end interface' in the form of their App doesn't mean a whole lot.  In fact I loathe the Spotify interface and app, but love the service. Specifically because with its API, there's an almost infinite number of way to control what music you'd like to listen to, and associate it with images, playlists, etc .etc.  So moving on to a very good example of how simple it is now to grab the field paths that are of importance to you, take a look at this Spotify Playlist JSON. Now somewhere in there you can spot ""uri's"" that are the direct links to each playlist that can be sent via Tasker Intents to immediately open and play/shuffle play that playlist.  But just from taking a visual glance at it, there's obviously uri's to a user's username as well as to the actual playlist and to who knows what else. There's ""uri"" fields all over the place along with url's, and just looking at it - ""uri"" looks a lot like ""url"".  Rather than spend time trying to wade through it to find each object path, I simply ran the new AutoTools JSON Query, and put in ""uri"" as the Query using %json_url set to the above mentioned Spotify JSON page.  AutoTools immediately returned to me the following:  playlists.items.owner.uri  playlists.items.uri      And without having to wander through the JSON mess in that linked pic above, I now know there's only two types of uri fields present, one belongs to the owner's username, and the other (likely) is the one I'm looking for - the one belonging to each playlist.  So what can I do with this? Something I'm already working on, a Tasker run front end for Spotify to do exactly the things I want. For example I have AutoVoice setup if were to say ""Play Metallica playlist"" it immediately uses AutoTools to parse that JSON page, get all the playlist uri's, have Tasker choose one at random from those results, and send an Intent to Spotify to play it.    To expound upon that, let's say you have a basic list of your favorite Bands/Artists, and want to just press a single shortcut on your Homescreen to instantly play a random playlist from a randomly selected artist inside your 'favorite artists list'. It would look like this:  <LIST OF FAVORITE ARTISTS> Variable Set %favorite_artists Value: ""Metallica,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Sting,Billy Joel, Elton John,Elvis Presley,""  <MAKE THAT LIST INTO AN ARRAY> Variable Split %favorite_artists Splitter ,  <PICK AN ARTIST ARRAY NUMBER AT RANDOM> Variable Randomize Name %rand Min: 1 Max: %favorite_artists(#)  <SET THE ACTUAL NAME OF A SELECTED ARTIST BASED ON THE RANDOM ARRAY NUMBER> Variable Set: %one_artist Value: %favorite_artists(%rand)  <MAKE SURE THE ARTIST NAME IS PROPERLY FORMATTED FOR A URL (i.e. no spaces)> Variable Convert: %one_artist Function: URL Encode   <BUILD A URL TO SEND VIA AUTOTOOLS TO SPOTIFY'S JSON page, notice the variable %one_artist IN THE MIDDLE> Variable Set: %json_url Value: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=%one_artist&type=playlist  <NAME OF THE FIELD TO GRAB FROM THE JSON> Variable Set: %field_name Value:  playlists.items.uri    <USE AUTOTOOLS TO GET ALL OF THE PUBLISHED PLAYLIST URI's FOR THAT ARTIST> Action > Plugin > AutoTools > JSON > Config   Field: %field_name    Json: %json_url     Variable Output: %playlists  <GET A RANDOM NUMBER BASED ON NUMBER OF RETURNED PLAYLIST RESULTS>  Variable Randomize  Name %rand Min: 1 Max: %playlists(#)  <SET THE FINAL PLAYLIST URI TO A RANDOMLY CHOSEN ONE> Variable Set %final_playlist Value: %playlists(%rand)  <OPEN SPOTIFY TO THE RANDOMLY SELECTED ARTIST AND PLAYLIST> Send Intent  Action: android.intent.action.VIEW  Data:  %final_playlist  <FOR AUTO START PLAYING CLICK SHUFFLE PLAY> Plugin > AutoInput > Click > Field Text > ""SHUFFLE PLAY"""

You might just be able to turn up the gesture-recognition sensitivity a ton (setting in preferences), so any motion of the door kicks off a gesture/shake event. Then react to that by taking a picture and sending it. Here's a forum talking about emailing a picture, but you should easily be able to Google for more if you need.

Well, the problem is the notifications are displayed one by one in the statusbar and notification panel and I don't want this. Well, if I use notify cancel this will work...for example: Alert/ Notify(Display Timeout)-icon permanent-on (1) Notify Cancel(2) Alert/ Notify(Display Timeout)-icon permanent-on(3) This will eliminate all the previous notifications and display the last one, (3). So, whenever I set my Display Timeout on the fly through a Scene, it will change the icon accordingly( I've used MonthDays icon ipack for this and edited a bit because I needed up to 60 seconds).   But, I also have a profile that will display an icon in the statusbar which tells me whether I'm connected to Wifi or not...it also displays me in the notification panel the ssid's name I'm currently connected to :)...If I'm not connected it will display No SSID( An alert message).   Now comes the problem, I 'm using a bright yellow star icon(builtin icon) to show me I'm connected to a particular Wifi Network..and another icon(a faded star) which tells me I'm no longer connected to any WiFi networks. Now,I don't want two icons in the statusbar...I don't want two star icons...I want the current one replace the old one...but I can manage this in two ways: 1) Using a Notify Cancel action which will also cancel the previous notification( Display Timeout) 2) Using the same Title for the two Notify Actions...I saw If I choose the same Title for the notifications, the current one will replace the former one and also keep all my previous notifications(triggered from other profiles) untouched.   But, this will work only if I choose the same Title for the notification which I personally don't want. I mean, I want to display in the Notification Panel the ssid's name in the first case when I'm connected to WiFi and a suggestive message in the opposite case...so I will have to use distinct Titles for these two Notify Actions. I've also seen 2 fields, ""Number"" and ""Priority""...what's their purpose...could they help me to achieve this? I want to achieve this scenario:   I'm connected to WiFi, then place the bright star icon in the statusbar...I'm no longer connected then replace that bright star with the faded one...and the process will be cyclic. Then, I will have either of those star icons in the statusbar and choose on the fly a specific Display Timeout, set it and place the icon(number) next to the star icon(whichever would it be). Please, help me with this...I'm struggling myself for about 1 day...also sorry for my clumsy english...I'm not native :) Thanks in advance :)"
tasker,3bm8o2,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:56:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand what you're trying to do. The is answer is at the moment you'll have to take your pick between two solutions:  The first one is the one you already know, you've got to balance/juggle creating and cancelling multiple notifications to get the text/title you want along with the icon you want, which has its limitations.  The other answer is to use the AutoNotification Plugin. This addresses notification by unique ID's. So as long as you assign the same ID (for example 4545) to the notification you create, every time you run AutoNotification again, and specify 4545 it updates everything/anything you want within that Notification slot.  The ONLY issue with AutoNotification at the moment is that while it lets you choose from a large variety of status bar icons, there is a list to choose from that cannot be modified. I'm not sure why that is, I'll have to ask the developer. Since in Tasker's Notify Action it lets you pic an ipack icon for the tiny image that always stays in the status bar.   So if you wanted to use MonthsDays for the tiny icon that always stays in the Status Bar, at the moment AutoNotification won't allow this.  Now, I have a question for you - you said that you modified MonthDays icon pak but you ""modified it"" so you can get up images that show up to 60 seconds. How did you modify it? Did you do it by hand, or using some apk application etc? This has been a topic of discussion around here and if there is an easy way to modify the icon pak(s) it would be great if you could post it!

I don't know if you are familiarized to Xposed Framework but I heard about an module, TextInject that allows you to inject text in the statusbar(or variables created in Tasker)...anyway, in my case this doesn't work as I'm on XtrestoLite Custom Rom and it doesn't allow me to add text(icons) to statusbar using methods other than Notifications.

After wrecking my mind I've also found out how to interrupt that loop such as when I'm no longer on mobile data, it will interrupt displaying that DataUsage message. Well...the first action, displaying data usage contains an action (goto action) which will be triggered only if a global variable %Global=1.

If the title for Notify Cancel is left blank, Tasker cancels all the notifications, including your Display Timeout, like you're experiencing. If you supply a title, it will Cancel only that notification. You need to store the last connected SSID into your own variable, %myLastSSID. This becomes the title of Bright yellow star notification. Then you can compare %myLastSSID with what is in %WIFII and if different, cancel the Bright yellow star notification, and post a Faded yellow star notification.    So you need 3 notifications, not 2, and you need to use Notify Cancel to remove them individually by addressing them by their titles. Hope that helps"

This is the text in 1 var ""Weather for June 29, 2015 is Overcast. High 18&deg;C (64&deg;F). Winds 7 kph SSW""    I'm trying to get rid of the amp;deg; in there. What regex would I use?"
tasker,3blxr5,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:59:47 2015 UTC,I figured it out. It's just as you say. I copied the HTTPD into another var and then Search Replace worked.
tasker,3bkqiq,jtl94,3,Tue Jun 30 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"SOLUTION:  Found this on a page below the one I mentioned in one of my replies in this thread. It details basic intents broadcast by Spotify.  First, in the Spotify app, make sure in Setting to set Broadcast Status to on.  In  your Tasker Profile, set Event > Intent Received and for the Intent just enter:  com.spotify.music.playbackstatechanged      That will trigger the Profile everytime the playback state changes, as in everytime you press play or pause in Spotify. The problem is that each time it changes, it doesn't tell you whether it played the track or paused the track.   But you can find out by combining that isMusicPlaying Task I posted the link to, which returns a simple true or false. (In the Spotify guide at that link supposedly the Intent also broadcasts this status as true/false in an Intent 'Extra' but I'm not sure how Tasker would read that. Someone here probably does.)  For the time being just wait say .5-1.5 secs in the Task after it detects the playback state change, run the isMusicPlaying Task from your main Task to see if audio is flowing, and in Return pick you varname like %is_playing and it will return to you ""true"" or ""false"".   So:  Action > Set Vibrate On IF %is_playing eq true  Action > Set Vibrate OFF IF %is_playing eq false      Tested and works. Use Profile Intent Received as described above, and to Task that looks kinda like this. Useful idea actually ;) Note you may need to adjust the wait time based on your device. I found 1.5 secs actually works best, as Spotify sometimes changes states in between songs or playlist changes to when the audio starts again."

tasker,3bkqiq,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jun 30 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"Spotify made a few recent updates, I just had to change a bunch of AutoInput Actions to reflect the updates. As the UI changed the data it transmits might as well.  Also Media Utilities is highly unreliable. It doesn't keep up with every update of every music app. So it's not surprising that with the recent Spotify update it made a Profile not work.  A work around is to control Spotify through the media controls in the latest Tasker Update that can target a media specifically, along with this Task(use the one that ends in ex.tsk.xml) that can detect whether music/audio is playing from the device at the moment and simply return 'true' or 'false'."
tasker,3bkqiq,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:17:54 2015 UTC,"So your work around would require me to set up some way to control Spotify through only Tasker tasks, then use that task to detect if music is playing and finally activate the volume profile based on that task? I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but that seems like more work than hoping Media Utilities does its job."
tasker,3bkqiq,Ratchet_Guy,3,Tue Jun 30 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the answer's the answer. As far as ""setup some way to control Spotify through only Tasker tasks"" it's already been done for you.  The latest version of Tasker has the SAME type of controls you'd expect from media utilities, except it actually works, and works twice as fast, and specifically on Spotify which is what I use it with.   So for example any media utilities command you used to run like play/pause or skip track, Tasker get the command over to Spotify twice as fast response wise than through the Media Utilities plugin, at least on my device. Note 4 Lollipop  And if you use just that Tasker direct control, you might not even need to check if music's playing, since by issuing certain commands to Spotify you'll likely know what the status will be.  EDIT: The only thing I use Media Utilities for is to get the album art from whatever's playing Spotify, and use that in a Scene I have setup for media control. I hate even opening the Spotify app, I play just about everything through Intents from Tasker.  Also, as Media Utilities isn't magic, it utilitzes some method to detect (or used to) whether a track was playing to set %MTRACK. Spotify is likey broadcasting something that might be able to be picked up by Tasker through Intents, and then you'd just set the Profile to IF Intent Received > Spotify Whatever > Do Something. You'd have to check the Spotify API and/or someone here might have that answer."
tasker,3bkqiq,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, no I know about the simulated media buttons in Tasker. I'm just thinking that controlling Spotify with those would require setting up (for example) a task that presses play in Spotify. But that would mean I have to go find the playlist I want in Spotify, play it within the app to make sure it was playing what I wanted, pause it, then use the Tasker task to play again. Unless I'm missing something here, that's a lot more work than just using Media Utilities.   That is a good idea to look in the Spotify API. I hadn't thought of that. Thanks for being helpful, I apologize if I don't seem appreciative."
tasker,3bkqiq,nickm_27,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's cool, as long as get the full perspective of how complex (or not) it is, which it seems you do.  The one thing about the playlists is that you can play them directly from Tasker using their URI and an Intent. If you open the web version of Spotify on say any desktop browser, Spotify has unique URI for each playlist, and using   Intent > Action android.intent.action.VIEW   Data: spotify:user:<username>:1kiQQ2edxdr   Where that last part is the URI of your personal playlist. There's just lots of neat little project ways to set things up. But if you just want to trigger something based on whether Spotify is playing something, there has to be an Intent sent to the Broadcast Receiver, because if Media Utilities can it figure out, and then when Spotify changes something suddenly it can't, likely whatever Spotify is broadcasting has changed."

As far as the array itself it'll just contain a bunch of question marks lol, but it's the count you're interested in.  Just make sure to escape the question mark in the Search field as it expects a Regular Expression and the question mark is a reserved Regex character. So make sure it is:  \?      And that's it.

tasker,3bfahq,TheoryFighter,3,Sun Jun 28 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"I think that technically after 160 characters it becomes an MMS.   So you would use compose MMS in Tasker's Actions, then you'd like need to use AutoInput to complete the send, as Tasker will open the default messaging app, fill in the Subject, Message, and add the Attachment as specified.  Now in my default messaging app, when Tasker goes there, the Reipients field already has focus, so in AutoInput it would be a simple Action > Paste (just use SetClipboard to put all your recipients in the clipboard in an Action before pasting).  Lastly just use AutoInput to click ""Send"".  And that's it!  EDIT: Tested it out - works great!"

tasker,3bfahq,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jun 28 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"As to the first part, it depends on how 'old' the device is. Most modern devices can receive MMS unless it's a flip phone from 2002.  As to the second part, yes most newer phones/carriers on sending out long message make an MMS since otherwise the message breaks into all separate message.  Now normally if you were using the default phone's messaging app, depending how it's setup, a long SMS can be sent solely as an SMS and will be broken up into several message and then you get those back to back texts saying ( 1/3 2/3 and then 3/3) and that gets annoying since sometime they show up out of order.

And if you recently upgraded to the newest version did the problem begin when you upgraded (likely a few weeks ago) or did it exist from the start?  It's likely some kind of bug, between Tasker and your device / version of Android or something. Because you shouldn't be getting that crash on widget add when Tasker's on.   Does it happen when both trying to add a widget and a shortcut? They're a little bit different but work the same for the most part, so if you can get away with adding the shortcut that would be a work around for now. Just take a close look when you go to add to your homescreen and you'll see that widget and shortcut are separate options.  I'm thinking it's bug as the S6 is fairly new and Tasker's newly updated."

It's really hard to turn off an alarm before it goes off. Yes, I know AlarmPad has math problems and all, but it's still as easy to snooze as dismiss.

So your profile would be Event -> System -> Intent Received.  Then in the action field, you paste ""mobi.beyondpod.action.PLAYBACK_STATUS""    What that will do is make a Tasker profile that will activate every time BeyondPod sends out that broadcast.  And so, in your profile, you'll find that the %episode_name is indeed created with the data you wanted.  (Test it out by making a Flash action that says ""EPISODE NAME: %episode_name"").    The variable will only be available to this particular profile, so you'll probably want to create a global variable by including a capital letter.

I was hoping there was a way I could set up a profile that every time I send a text message, the receiver's name could be written to a separate list, which would reset every morning. Then, when the project is pulling a name to send a message to, it could compare to the other list and just avoid picking the same name.... or something to that affect."
tasker,3b8j20,1Bagpiper,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, that would be the way.  So, lets start with naming the list. Lets call it %Todays_Texts  Then you want to reset it everyday at midnight. So setup a Profile > Time 00:01 to 00:01 (I like one minute after midnight lol) and link it to a Task that has a simple Action > Variable Clear > %Todays_Texts  Then to build the list each day, at the end of your Task that sends the text messages, add an:  Action > Variable Set > %Todays_Texts Value: %name,    (Where %name is whatever variable you're using to keep the track of the name). Make sure to include that comma after %name to separate the values, or you can use a slash / or hyphen - or any character really. Then MAKE SURE you check the checkbox in the Set Variable Action that's labelled ""Append"". This adds on to the Variable each time it is written to.  The last thing you want to do is at the very start of your 'Send Message Task', or wherever in the Task it deal with sending the message, you would add an Action > Stop > then an IF statement that checks IF %name MATCHES *%Todays_Texts* make sure to include the Asterisks like:  Action > Stop   IF %name ~ *%Todays_Texts*      And all that does is look for the name in today's texts and if the name's in there, it doesn't proceed with the Task.  Also, I think there was an original thread on this Task? Do you have the link to it by any chance?  EDIT: Revised the matching statement  EDIT: Lol, I just realized what you meant by ""conversation"". I thought you meant verbally on the phone, but now I realize that you mean already in a ""TEXT conversation"", that you initated outside of Tasker. Well at least my solution might provide an idea for something else.  Anyhow to do what you're talking about requires access to the phone's text message database. If you're rooted you'd do that through sqlite but I'm guessing you're not rooted and/or you don't have alot of database query knowledge. So basically outside of that there's no way to constantly log whoever you're texting throughout the day through a messaging app outside of Tasker, unless there's a plugin or app I'm unaware of that you can integrate with Tasker.  The only real creative solution that came to mind, is that if when you're in your Text messaging app, and on a screen where it sends a mesage, if there's something unique to that screen you might be able to yank the name and use the above method. You would have a Profile > Application > Messages, then an AutoInput UI Query, and based on the results of that Query if certain items/elements are present on the screen, meaning you're sending a text etc then it could log the name. Just thinking way out of the box here."

I have countless Zooper widgets in every shape inside on many homescreens that all integrate with Tasker in some way or another.  Here is a great resource for learning Zooper as well as getting your questions answered: Zooper Widget Central  As far as setting it up, Zooper is a whole world unto it self, similar to Tasker, but not quite as complex or extensive. In a nutshell you setup your Zooper ""Scene/Widget"" with all the kinds of the elements you want.  You can then control those elements using the Zooper Plugin for Tasker that installs itself automatically when you install Zooper. All this does is send a variable name/value over to Zooper based on a Tasker variable.  At that point you setup Zooper to deal with it accordingly. At it most basic, if there's a text field in Zooper you want to display text everytime Tasker updates it, you would set the default text in that field to a Zooper variable named say #TMY_TASKER_TEXT# (and the surrounding hashtags are Zoopers var configuration).  The in Tasker everytime you want that text to change on your homepage, you have an Action somewhere in a Task that uses Plugin > Zooper > Set Variable > #TMY_TASKER_TASK# Value: %my_text  Where %my_text is whatever the text is you want to send over from Tasker. So like:  Variable Set: %my_text Value: Welcome To My Homescreen!  Plugin > Zooper > Set Variable > #TMY_TASKER_TASK# Value: %value"

They both heat stuff up and ionizing radiation is proven to break up DNA. The radiation emitted by cell phones is non-ionizing, therefore the safety standards were set only with heat in mind.   I see 2 problems:   1. I'm pretty sure we don't know EVERYTHING there is to know about radiation and its interactions with organic matter. 2. Proteins (such as DNA) can be broken up by heat, in a process called denaturation. It's also been found out that if you cook food for a long time at a lower temperature, more nutrients will be destroyed than if you cooked it at a higher temp. for a shorter time. Maybe being exposed to very low amount of heat caused by cell phone radiation for ~10 hours daily isn't as harmless as we would like to think.

If you want, you can turn on developer options, enable Show Touches and then find the X and Y positions that you like.  If you have a pattern lock, then Secure Settings has a function to enable/disable pattern lock. Use that. I think it also has the same for a pin lock, but I'm not sure. Anyway, if it doesn't, the next paragraph should solve that.  If you have  a password ( or pin) lock, you can store the correct password (or pin) in a global variable in tasker. So when you want to unlock, you would do  the upward swipe shell command, and then paste the password into the text box. And probably use an 'input tap' to hit the enter key or a KeyEvent"

I'm of the opinion that nothing super-mission-critical should be stored solely in global vars permanently, but for a lot of things - I think it's simpler than constantly reading/writing text files.   Just two viewpoints. As far as speed or reliability I can't say one is faster/better over the other, but IF there was one to be, it would likely be using the Global Vars is a hair faster and maybe even more reliable than constantly opening/closing/appending/re-writing a text file."
tasker,3b4g1n,letestaccount,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like we've had this discussion before. LOL.(Edit: like funny, ha ha, not trying to be a dick.) I'm not saying make exclusive use of the read/write file actions. I see no difference in speed when using globals vs text files, but tomato tomato. I prefer to write my stuff in a way so any global variable called is automatically restored to a usable state if something happened previously to render it unusable. I don't like having to manually fix things. Do I have all my global variables backed up in text files, or databases, or smoke signals or whatever? No. That's far from practical. Do I have the almost static bits of data I cant get from a website also stored in some method other than a global variable? Yes. Storing data for periods of time in a global variable is not an issue. I make constant use of hundreds and hundreds of global variables that are not backed up. Seriously. Would I care if every one was cleared tonight? No. They all will revert to a usable state if necessary next time they are called. It might not be the previous value, but I don't ever have to go through a manual restore."
tasker,3b4g1n,Meartn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. I also have hundreds of globals storing this or that. The thing is, depending on how they were setup at the time I was working on a Task/Project, they may not be as easily 'reset / replenished' as I would like, should I be building that Task again today perhaps.   So I just thought it a good thing to make something to back em up ESPECIALLY as Tasker doesn't store them anywhere in its own backup. I suppose depending on all the kinds of crap people might store in those vars it could bloat the backup, but my 'variable backup' text file I have only amounts to all of 19KB.  Just peace of mind I guess, should there be anything in there I might need should they vanish somehow.  Tomato Tomahhto"

BT Near (and WiFi near) aren't infallible, and are one of those things where if it works consistently for you depending on what you're setting it up for - that's great.  Anyhow you're on the right track. Just get another device to test it with, as both paired and unpaired. See if Tasker will detect it's near, and you can go from there.  If you're trying to detect when your girl is near so you can get your other girl out the back - good plan."
tasker,3b459t,Ratchet_Guy,2,Thu Jun 25 22:50:15 2015 UTC,Haha on the theory. It's for work and my boss. Sometimes he's in the office and sometimes he works from home. I want my phone on silent if it detects him in the office.   I tried BT near but only paired devices show up when I click the device finder button. Do I have to be paired with his phone for this to work?
tasker,3b459t,nickc122,3,Fri Jun 26 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good plan, though you'll have to test the range on it. And like most things with Tasker, if this is something that could have consequences (which I assume wouldn't be too serious as most bosses are adults and not snitchy big brothers) you're better off checking it yourself to make sure it's reliable."
tasker,3b459t,Ratchet_Guy,2,Fri Jun 26 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"On that one not quite sure, I haven't messed around with it enough to know if it detects any Bluetooth devices near or only paired ones.   Do you have a device nearby that is unpaired to test it out with? Or one you can unpair for the moment to test it?  Since as you mention it does have a button for ""Unpaired Device"".   Something to check into and change perhaps is in Tasker's Main Preferences > Monitor Tab scroll way down and you'll see a setting field titled ""BT Scan Seconds"". I think it's set to 120 by default, which means Tasker's only taking a look every 2 minutes in that case.  You can have it check more often, but depending on what you're checking for (BT or Wifi etc) it can use a bit more battery. I would say change that setting to check every 30 seconds and find a device that is not paired with yours and see if Tasker can locate it.  EDIT: However, if your boss has his phone's bluetooth off, your plan is foiled ;)"

tasker,3b2374,overseergti,2,Thu Jun 25 15:25:23 2015 UTC,There are a lot of benefits.  Instead of just running a task you can customize your notifications you receive on your watch.  With those notifications you could setup about 10 different buttons that could be pressed or motion controlled (shaking) to lunch a task.   You are not limited to just the 20 task (if i remember correctly) you can run from pebbletasker.  You can setup various menus (20 item limit) to launch task.  I bought PebbleTasker and then regretted it within a day of having autopebble.  Hopefully my rambling has helped some.

tasker,3b3zqa,donutz,3,Thu Jun 25 19:55:22 2015 UTC,This would be insanely difficult without some kind of input from you. While AutoVoice can detect ambient sound it can't do much with it unless it matches a profile. There's not much hope in it knowing if you're talking to yourself or if someone else is talking.  You might consider using an NFC tag that you tap when you're alone in the car (before you start driving) to turn on your read aloud functions. A second tap could toggle it off when you get out of the car or when you pick up a passenger. Maybe include a default turn off profile when the detect driving goes away as well in case you forget to turn off when you get out of the car.
tasker,3b3zqa,MikeWyzlic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:27:10 2015 UTC,AutoVoice has a listen feature that can determine ambient noise. I use it to manage my phone volumes.

tasker,3ayxqf,Ratchet_Guy,3,Wed Jun 24 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF THE JSON PARSER:  Imagine reading any document on your device of any kind, and seeing the name of a band / Recording Artist you like, or a band you've never heard of or are interested in...  ...then simply clicking on it and sharing it to Tasker (via AutoShare) and Tasker uses AutoTools JSON parser to get the exact Artist URI from Spotify.com, and then Tasker opens Spotify app to that Artist's page, and immediate clicks Play or Shuffle Play (through AutoInput).  Time to music playing from when you clicked on the artist's name - 5 seconds.  Setup would be like this if you just want to test it with a hardcoded artist name:  Variable Set: %artist_name Value: Metallica  Variable Set: %my_url Value: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=%artist&type=artist  <FOLLOWING ACTION GETS %atjsonvalues() WHICH CONTAINS THE ARTIST URI> Plugin > AutoTools > JSON > Config  FIELD: artists.items.uri   JSON: %my_url  <PULL UP THIS ARTIST MAIN SCREEN IN TASKER> Action > Send Intent >  android.intent.action.VIEW  Data: %atjsonvalues()  <CLICK SHUFFLE PLAY TO BEGIN PLAYING THEIR MUSIC> Plugin > AutoInput > Click > Text ""SHUFFLE PLAY""      And in this case the exact text returned in the JSON query for the Spotify Intent to open Spotify to Metallica's Spotify Homepage is:  spotify:artist:2ye2Wgw4gimLv2eAKyk1NB      So you're probably asking where exactly does this JSON data come from? If I wanted to look at it all. Well in this case in searching for ""Metallica"" here is the ful JSON return from Spotify using the link: https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=Metallica&type=artist  Scroll a bit down the results and you'll see where it says ""Metallica"" and immediately after that is the ""uri"". This is the ""FIELD:"" you specified in the JSON AutoTools query as detailed in the code above as:  artists.items.uri      So Tasker just takes this and plugs it into the Intent and off you go listening to Metaillica or whatever Artist you put into %artist_name. The real magic happens when you get %artist_name from Tasker's own Get Voice input Action or an AutoVoice prompt to set %artist_name.   Equally as cool is to get the %artist_name from an AutoShare Command whereby simply clicking on the name in any text you can share from any screen on your device immediately opens and plays that Artist's songs in Spotify. Can AutoRemote it too, basically anything you can think of. I like it :)"

tasker,3ayxqf,plepleus,2,Wed Jun 24 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"I think this is great as well!!  Do you have the .xml for it?  As it seems at the moment each solution has certain strengths. Guess couple questions on what you came up with, does it support named groups, i.e. (?:The )(?<animal>monkey|bird|tiger) would auto-return ""%animal=tiger"" if string was ""The tiger"" ?  I think where you have something really good going on though is that, if I'm looking at it correctly, %test is an array of all captures, so in your example, I'm wondering what %test1 and %test2 return?  I would think the only two matches are ""monkey"" and ""tiger"" as they are the only 5+ char matches. So is %test1 empty, or is it the whole string match...? And then %test2=monkey and %test3=tiger?"
tasker,3ayxqf,joaomgcd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"here's the xml  It does not support named groups because tasker only allows me to return a single variable.  In my task, it will go through the entire string, find and return every match.  In my example, after the split, %test1=2 (for 2 extracted matches) and %test2=monkey and %test3=tiger.  The regex task can be modified to add the full capturing group too.  I just have it setup so it doesn't return that."
tasker,3ayxqf,ryoendeprouw,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"Tried it out, works excellent!  As far as Tasker only allowing you to return one variable, perhaps think about it more like - it only allows you return one string.  Then after getting that string back, it can be processed again, which you're already doing. So for example right now you've got this coming back:  %test = 2||monkey||tiger   Now, as that's already gotta be split anyways, what's two splits right? So lets say you send back:  %data = 2||monkey||tiger{****}ball_color==red***grass_color==green***sky_color==blue  Variable Split %test Splitter: {****}  Set Variable %group_matched=%data1 Set Variable %group_named=%data2   <DONE WITH THIS ONE> Variable Split %group_matched Splitter: ||  <PROCESS THE OTHER> Variable Split %group_named Splitter: ***  <NAME AND SET ALL VARS DYNAMICALLY> For %pair Items: %group_named()    Variable Split %pair Splitter: ==   Variable Set %%pair1 Value: %pair2  End For      And then you've got everything set. If you can pull the named groups out of the Java, just pop them on the end of the string you're already returning like above. Of course I choose some random characters as the splits, but, I also chose ones not likely to be seen in a Regex results as well as ones easy to see if you've got to physically look at the string for testing, etc."
tasker,3ayxqf,13139269,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, returning a string is absolutely what it does, it'd be nice if it could do more so we wouldn't have to split the return value.  All I was doing in the task was impending the Pattern and Matcher classes from the Android Java.  It takes options and can return more data. So with Tasker it would just be a way of modifying in inputs and outputs."
tasker,3ayxqf,TeamTuck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"This is really cool. Another tool in the toolbox for sure. At the moment Tasker can return the whole string, so that's that. And AutoTools can name variable(s) and return an array of any capturing groups, but currently not multiple times returning 'every match' (although it's in Alpha so over time it will probably be a cure-all hopefully), and your solution can return an array of all matches, even if they occur multiple times in the input string.  So, depending on the situation, we use the tool for job at hand. I think you should definitely keep working on this, developing whatever functionality you find relevant."

tasker,3b16c2,johnnygriggos,2,Thu Jun 25 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"Can be done, I've done it. It's a bit of a chore but just a repetitive one, not rocket science.  Just depends though on what you mean by 'pages'? I assume you mean 'scrolling' down through 'pages' of results of some sort?  Basically in a nutshell it works like this:   Pick the word / item / thing you're looking for and place it in a variable, let's say %match Get to the first page. Use AutoInput > UI Query to 'look' at the page. It returns all the stuff on the page in a variable name %aitext. You do this not by specifying the %match data in the UI Query Config, because then, AI's just going to sit around waiting for that word to appear before proceeding with the Task, which doesn't work out if you need to scroll. So... When you go into UI Query > Config, just dont' select anything then back out of it, and you'll see the screen shows you %aitext is available. Then in the next action set an IF %aitext ~ *%match* If it returns true, you're done because the match is on the screen. If it doesn't find the %match then you start running a loop whereby you use AutoInput>Action>Scroll Forwards and anchor it to something you know will be on the screen, or based on %aitext, or an x,y point if all else fails. After each scroll, check again with UI Query to see if %match is on the screen. And then keep the loop running until it finds what you're looking for, and which point you have a Goto Action to jump to the next part of the Task (jump out of the loop). Now you don't want it looping forever, so in the loop you keep a counter, and if the number of max loop iterations is reached, you Goto a 'Not Found' Action.   Looks like this:  <Run whatever Actions you need to get you to the screen you want to be at>  Set Variable %match = ""Nike Sneaker""  Anchor: Label <SEARCH> Variable Add %count + 1  IF %count < 10    AutoInput > UI Query    GOTO Label ""MATCH FOUND""  IF %aitext ~ *%match*    AutoInput > Scroll Forward > (on whatever anchor you can find)    Wait 1 second (gives the screen time to update)    GOTO Label ""SEARCH""  ELSE    Alert > Flash ""Timed Out - No Match Found!""    STOP  END IF  Anchor: Label <MATCH FOUND> (do whatever you want to do here when the match is found)      Now I might have outlined it a bit different than I put it in the steps, but hopefully you get the idea - Look, test, if match finish, if not scroll, start loop again, until/unless the max scroll count reached, which is being kept track of above in %count.  EDIT: Realized you mentioned 'previous' pages, so just use AI to 'Scroll Backwards' or if you need to implement the 'BACK' hard/sofy key, just use AutoInput > Global > Back  action instead of the scroll."

A profile runs its task once, when all its conditions become true. Then it doesn't run it again until at least one condition has become false and then they've all become true again.  ""Turn off WiFi between 8am and 5pm"" will turn it off at 8am, and then (if Restore Settings is checked), turn it on at 5pm, and that is it. If you turn it on in between, Tasker doesn't care."

I usually transferred Titanium Backup but since I was going from rooted to non-rooted and had no SD card in my new phone I just relied on this.  None of my variables were saved.  I checked in the userdata.xml file and sure enough there is no variable definitions there.  So don't rely on Tasker backup to save those.

Even though I could swear that when I've migrated devices in the past it took the Vars with it, maybe it only took the references and not the values.  So sure enough I did look in the .xml file(s) and they're not there. So the first question is - where does it keep the Global Variable Values?  And the second part, that I started working on today when I realized this, is how to create a simple Tasker Task that can backup all Global User Vars to a text file, and then another Task to reset them later on.   I will probably be running this everyday when I run my typical Tasker backup. Will post the Task code/xml as soon as I have it finished."
tasker,3ausyq,OG_RudeBwoy,2,Tue Jun 23 20:54:55 2015 UTC,This is a long shot but maybe it's a security feature or something like that. Tasker emphasizes how the xml backups are unsecured and can be read by any app quite a lot and variables can contain sensitive/private data so maybe the app doesn't store it in the xml to prevent that data getting to another app?
tasker,3ausyq,OG_RudeBwoy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe but somewhat unlikely, because all that type of variable could just as easily be stored within local variables inside of each Task, so if you have Task 'Whatever':  Variable Set %username Value: BobStevens Variable Set %password Value: 1z2x34ed   And then you Export either the xml on that Task or the whole Tasker backup, that info is stored in there.   Unless it's stated somewhere that sensitive information should be stored in Global Variables for the specific fact that they don't get exported anywhere, and in order to read them you'd have to go into Tasker (which itself can be totally locked with a password in the main settings).

tasker,3aw951,amskhan,2,Wed Jun 24 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is directly the comparison of time, but on a bigger level it's an architecture problem with how you've set this up.    A profile should only be active when it's needed, not for the entire time the screen is on, waiting. Instead, trigger on text received or call received. This way it will work with the screen on or off.    Also, tasks only run once, when they are triggered by the profile. That task as you've written it is run when the screen comes on, and then finished. So SMSRT will never equal TIMES (which is in milliseconds) unless you turn on the phone at precisely the time you get a text.    Here's one solution: Create new profile ""Call logger"", trigger on Event, select Phone, select Missed Call. Done, press back. Create new task ""Increment Calls"", add Variable, Variable Set, %Calls, set it to %Calls +1, tick do math.    Create new profile ""Text logger"", trigger on Event, select Phone, select Received text. Done, press back. Create new task ""Increment Texts"", add Variable, Variable Set, %Texts, set it to %Texts +1, tick do math.    These profiles only run when they need to, and the task runs once and is done.

Once it finds one it will stop and flash the date.  The format of the date is set in step A21 (it will output, e.g., 07/11/2015), you can change that using the different strings described in SimpleDateFormat  Step A65 is where you're looking for something specific in your Work calendar event title.  A69 is just come housekeeping because the date ends up getting set to midnight the following Sunday.  The other interesting thing I found in doing this is that I can keep on adding 7 to the day and it'll track the months without me having to change anything else.

A couple of things to note:   You will have to register at Forecast.io to get an API Key, which must then be entered in the third action of the task (i.e. 3. Variable Set %apikey). The first couple of actions (HTTP Get with Stop) is just to test the internet connection.  I use Secure Settings to enable/disable the location services, but if you always keep them on you can just delete these actions.  You might have to play with the location variables and splits (%loc2, %loc21 %loc22 etc.) to get the right output in the notification. Try e.g. %loc3, %loc31 etc. if it doesn't look right.

It seems easy at first until you realize all the time variations and how they need to be spoken. Well I was throwing in ""o'clock' n stuff.  Anyways, I checked out yours which is actually pretty cool, as it's a simple and direct way to do it. However - I'll give you a cool idea - right now you trigger it by turning the screen on?  Why even try and find the power button or pick up the phone, when you can just wave your hand near it with the proximity sensor =) Just setup a Profile with two States: Proximity Sensor + Screen Off  Then have it trigger you Task. Can add a time trigger as well to have it only work during certain hours. Now whenever the screen is off during those times just reach towards the phone, fumble around, it'll tell you the time ;)"

tasker,3asuw2,iWizardB,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's on all the time anyways. In the main Tasker Preferences under the Monitor tab if you scroll down it mentions Light and Proximity sensors and whether Tasker is checking them or not.  It may or may not impact battery. I used to use it a lot at night, and I don't remember it really eating up battery.   Even better now that I think about it - use the AutoVoice plugin (have it set to Always Listening) and just yell out ""WHAT TIME IS IT?"" lol. It would work actually. That scenerio though may impact battery life, to have AutoVoice always listening. It'd be funny though. I mean if the phone talks to you, you might as well talk to it ;)"
tasker,3asuw2,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:07:10 2015 UTC,"Anything which is ""always on"" will eat battery. I first had tried to implement it by using ""volume button press between 6-8 AM"" as a trigger. But apparently ""volume button press"" can't be detected by Tasker..!! There is a third party app which runs a service to detect that, but again, that drains battery. So, I settled for screen awakening. I don't find finding the power button hard anyway."
tasker,3asuw2,iWizardB,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:11:51 2015 UTC,"The AutoInput plugin detects the volume key press. It can disable the key too (Even during certain times) from its default function as volume, so when you pressed it, it wouldn't effect the volume, just do what you'd like, in this case say the time.  And now that I think about it, turning that screen on probably wastes some battery. I think you should keep your phone plugged in at night from now on."

I'm not sure if this would work well, and I don't have specifics, but have you thought of turning on airplane mode when your phone is out of range/disconnected from all trusted towers? Once airplane mode is enabled, it can be disabled periodically for a short period of time (maybe even with mobile data still disabled) to check which tower it connects to, and if it's non-trusted, go back into airplane mode, if it's trusted and you disabled mobile data while checking the tower, you can re-enable it. I'd set up a persistent notification to show the current status, whether it's connected, disconnected, searching, etc. and maybe a button to change the interval between checks."

You could use the location context and set up a fence around the area you normally get off the bus, then make the task say whatever you want it to say. Pretty simple.

I think you could get even more accurate with using the Google Directions API.  My thought is that you could create a scene where you enter the final destination address. Then use the API to get initial directions from your current GPS location %LOC.  Within the returned JSON data the API will give the number of stops and estimated time of arrival.  If you have a long ride we could use the time of arrival to start checking the number of stops, let's say, 5 minutes before arrival (setting a global time variable and a profile to run another directions task at a 5 minutes before your arrival time).    You can check every minute at that time (or throughout the trip) and when the number of stops is equal to 1 then you can issue your alarm.  You have 2500 request per day with the free API key which comes out to be about 1.7 requests per minute.  If multiple buses run on the same area I'm sure issues would arise.  It also could be easily modified to handle transfers since the JSON data will have that info."

In IFTTT you'd set up this type of combo to link a message received with the term Create_Gmail to then send the Gmail..  ...with the fields of Recipient, Body, and Attachment populated by Tasker's variable Value data.  So you'd use something like the following Tasker Action code:  Variable Set %recipient Value: whomever@wherever.com  Variable Set %body Value: Here is the image.<br><br>Hope you like it!  Variable Set %attachment Value: http://a4cwsn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Fun-with-Directions-512-icon.png  Variable Set %msg_string Value:   Create_Gmail=:=%recipient=:=%body=:=%attachment  Plugin > AutoRemote > Send Message > MyIFTTT > %msg_string      And then it sends the email, which apparently can attach any file that is web accessible, including I would assume a dynamically generated one.

Quoting from that page:   However, if you are not a programmer, you will find it tough going to write your own scripts. It's not for the faint-hearted, so be prepared to spend significant time learning how to use it.   As I'm a programmer, it doesn't 'scare me off' but what is disconcerting, is when it uses example scripts like this one to say send a Gmail, it requires the Gmail password to be entered, and unless you want to enter it everytime, it's going to be stored somewhere, unencrypted. There's probably some way around that, but if you're not into Python and prefer everything on better lockdown in regards to passwords, IFTTT may be the way to go."

What I'm truly hoping is that people will implement putting IFTTT with Tasker in certain ways and report back.   The way I see it, it's basically a create-your-own-plugin setup for any App that doesn't have direct Tasker integration, but is currently integrated with IFTTT."
tasker,3arbeh,nickc122,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:18:35 2015 UTC,"My only issue with it is that you can't modify any of the notifications you get from IFTTT before it posts.  You would have to intercept it with another app, which makes it kind of clunky.    Also I can't really think of any real-world uses for me at the moment."
tasker,3arbeh,nickc122,2,Mon Jun 22 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"Could you clarify on that? For example just using the weather notification example, IFTTT returns about 20 different variables to Tasker that could be customized into any kind of notification(s), whether that be scenes, variables, AutoNotification customzied stuff, etc.  I guess that's where using Tasker/AutoRemote instead of any of IFTTT's Android Apps is the advantage? Plus IFTTT's Android App in the Play Store asks for every single permission possible on the device/phone lol. I think that's also where Tasker comes in handy - IFTTT doesn't get access to a single bit of data unless you send it with Tasker/AutoRemote."

tasker,3arbeh,joaomgcd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well, that's why you use Tasker and AutoRemote. If IFTTT is sending you the body of the reddit pm in one of the AutoRemote Variables, you can use Tasker to 'edit' the body however you'd like.  After that, I'm not sure what you're currently using as a 'notification', but after using Tasker to edit the body, you'd use Tasker to generate the notification as well.  I'd say this can be done, but you've just got to clarify on what you mean by editing the body (what do you want to do to it) and how you want to be notified. If you're currently using the IFTTT Android App to receive IFTTT data and notifications, this method using Tasker would be used instead of that for whatever you need more control over."

Tasker Scenes have their uses too, but Zooper's great for having constant data present. Pocket's cool too, I gotta use that more ;)  EDIT: As you're using this to return data to Tasker, and I realized just using my initial ""Weather ' example that there's 20 different variable values (ingredients lol) that IFTTT can potentially return, I think that trying to keep track of the order and deal with them in afterwards in Tasker by their numerical position in some array could get burdensome, if indeed you're going to return a dozen values, etc.  So a quick way to deal with that, if yourself or anyone wants an add-on to all this, is when you have IFTTT send back the string to the right of the =:= (the one that AutoRemote by default calls %arcomm but you can rename it) you could name the variables DIRECTLY INSIDE of IFTTT by instead of doing it all in Tasker using something like this:  Example - at end of IFTTT output string:  IFTTT_WeatherUpdate=:=current_temp={{CurrentTemp}}^humidity={{Humidity}}^sunset={{SunsetAt}}      Then in Tasker:  Variable Set %var_string  Value: %arcomm  Variable Split %var_string Splitter: ^  FOR %pair Items: %var_string()    Variable Split %pair Splitter: =    Variable Set %%pair(1) Value: %pair(2)  End For      And after that you've got all your variables setup in Tasker! (uses that %% to auto-name vars in that loop). If you want global Tasker vars just use upper-case lettering in the IFTTT string i.e.  IFTTT_WeatherUpdate=:=Current_temp={{CurrentTemp}}^Humidity={{Humidity}}^Sunset={{SunsetAt}}      And run that same For loop code. A lot easier than trying to remember to assign a ton of variable values returned by IFTTT by their position in an array slot."

tasker,3aqovp,TremendoSlap,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:10 2015 UTC,"Ah that sucks, I was hoping you'd have a slot in your fusebox that was only hot when the key was turned.  Frankly I'd be a bit surprised that it doesn't actually have one, whether it's your mirrors or something.  Then you could in principle use an Add-A-Circuit to give life to your new socket while sharing the same slot.  Just about as non-invasive as it can get.  As for the bluetooth, I think there are too many factors to give you a solid answer (rom, kernel, whether the tablet has Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy), but my understanding is bluetooth has pretty minimal impact."

If your air mouse is compatible with your device and is hooked up properly, chances are AutoInput can detect the key press of the mouse button.  You would just setup Profile>Event>Plugin>AutoInput>Key  And then in your linked Task do whatever you want done. To set it up properly the first time you setup the Profile you would select None of the key choices (as it will prompt you) in order to trigger the Profile on any key whatsoever.  Then again for testing purposes the first time you make a linked Task to Alert/Flash/etc. %aikeycode and %aikeycodename to get the button name AutoInput registers as you press the air mouse button.  For example I use this exact test-setup in order test keys on certain devices/hardware, so I turn this test Profile on, and then if I press say the home key - I get a Flash that looks like this which is nothing more than Flash'ing:  %aikeycode %aikeycodename"

When I finish reading a book in FBReader, I share the book to AutoShare, which triggers a task to send it to IFTTT.  Although, I'm not using AutoRemote. It was really simple to set up an HTTP Post task to post directly to IFTTT Maker channel without AutoRemote."
tasker,3alr9w,goodevilgenius,2,Sun Jun 21 15:13:26 2015 UTC,Lets take this in another direction for a brief moment - what can IFTTT do that Tasker can't (and that includes Tasker with all its plugins) ??
tasker,3alr9w,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jun 21 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of IFTTT channels. I'm not sure there are Tasker plugins that match all of those channels.  Life360, Pocket, Google Drive, Evernote, etc. A lot of these have APIs that you could hook into using Takser, if you're willing to do the research to figure out how. But it's a heck of a lot easier with IFTTT.  Also, IFTTT can check a whole lot of services, and act on them when they update. Your phone can do the same thing, but why waste your own data and processing power on your phone when you can offload that to IFTTT? E.g., you want to change your phone background to the latest top picture posted on /r/aww? Sure, you could parse the RSS or JSON feed on your phone yourself, and do it entirely with Tasker. Or you could let IFTTT figure out when a new top post is posted, and have that pushed to your phone. Easier for you, easier for your phone, easier for your data plan."
tasker,3alr9w,goodevilgenius,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the answer and the detail.   Basically offloading the creation of a Task to a service that can always be processing it, and just return to you the bottom line / result.  And I guess then use Tasker to focus on doing something with the result(s).  Looking at the IFTTT 'apps' it's kind of like Tasker superLite  EDIT: As far as AutoRemote goes, these integration details seem excessively convoluted."

You don't need to use AutoRemote to interact with IFTTT, though. At least, not for sending data to IFTTT (but maybe for receiving data from IFTTT).

tasker,3alr9w,goodevilgenius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:52:24 2015 UTC,"It's slow with some things, but many channels (like the Maker channel that AutoRemote uses) it's almost always instantaneous. There are several channels, like Maker, SMS, Email and others, that react right away, rather than polling periodically. And the polling rate is usually about 15 minutes, so even the ""slow"" ones aren't that slow.  Also, I can't imagine using IFTTT to send data between devices anyway. It's mostly to send info between services, or from your device to another service not easily supported by Tasker."
tasker,3alr9w,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:24:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, so, I went and hooked the whole shabang up, according to the instructions on the JoApps website, and can conclude that - while there is potential for certain uses, the ""problem"" for me lies in the fact that in order to use the majority of the most useful features, or 'channels' as IFTTT calls them - you have to grant IFTTT access to all those services.  To me this represents a huge mega-security risk, unless you're willing to setup say Drive accounts or Twitter accounts for the sole purpose of integrating with IFTTT. I'm simply not comfortable with one online service having access to all my other online services.  As far as things that don't need access, like lets say - Weather, it can be setup to AutoRemote a whole bunch of local weather parameters to your device at say - a certain time. But it can't be setup to do it on demand i.e. ""IF RECEIVE > AutoRemote request for weather info THEN > Send weather info back to AutoRemote""  Because that would require an additional ""THEN"". For example the above scenerio in IFTTT terms really translates to ""IF RECEIVE MAKER > AutoRemote request for weather info THEN > QUERY WEATHER CHANNEL, THEN > MAKER MAKE WEB 'REQUEST' back to AutoRemote with the queried weather information.  And in a nutshell as someone mentioned, why bother with all that when you can just send the HTTP get request to any website that provides weather info and immediately get back the JSON info and parse it for whatever you"

tasker,3akb98,goodevilgenius,3,Sun Jun 21 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"Problem:  My phone charger sometimes gets really loose, where a slight movement will stop it from charging. When the screen's off, my phone makes a noise when I plug it in (usually), but not when I unplug it. Most of the time when it's charging, it's on my nightstand when I'm trying to sleep, and I like to keep it face-down so the charging light doesn't bother me.  Of course, since it doesn't make a noise when I unplug it, the only way to know it's still charging is to look at the charging light or the screen, neither of which I can see with it face-down. And if I lift it up to check, it might come loose when I put it back down, so I have to do it very carefully, and only lift it until I can see the faint glow the light casts on my nightstand.  I'd always worry that I'll think it's charging, but not know it wasn't until I wake up and it doesn't have nearly enough power to last me the whole day. I don't think it ever happened, but it was definitely a possibility.  Solution:  I simply set up a profile with the context State->Power->Power, set to Any, meaning the profile is active when it's plugged in. For the entry task (to occur when power is connected), I selected the action Alert->Beep. For the exit task (to occur when power is disconnected) I also selected Alert->Beep, only with a distinctly lower frequency.  Now, when I plug it in, I listen for the beep to confirm it's charging. If at any point it comes loose, I'll hear a lower beep. But as long as the most recent beep I heard was the higher one, I'll know it's charging.    Problem:  I follow Twitch Plays Pokémon rather closely. For those who are unaware, it's a 24/7 live stream in which Pokémon games are played by chat-controlled button inputs.  It's generally extremely difficult to know when, time-wise, any given point in the game will be reached. Yet I often want to ensure I see a given event. Whenever the stream is running (I said it's 24/7, but they go long periods in between games now) I like to keep it on in the background, so I can hear when certain things happen. I can't just stay awake constantly, but that would seem like the only way to guarantee I'm not sleeping at whatever time that happens.  Solution:  I'm one of the people in charge of posting to the live update feed for the stream. Here's an example so you can see what I mean. The guy who runs the stream doesn't post in the chat much, so when he does, it's generally something notable enough to go in the updater. So I created a bot that automatically posts his messages to the updater.  As I already keep a program running that monitors the stream chat, I added a function to it that I can tell to watch for certain key phrases that I predict will be said en masse around a time I want to be awake. Once one of them triggers, it sends a message to my phone via Pushbullet.  Pushbullet has a built-in Tasker plugin for sending and reacting to messages, so I used that. Whenever it receives that particular message, it sounds an alarm. (I did this using the Alert->Morse action set to the text ""oooooo"".) It even launches the Twitch app for me.  So far, there have been a few false alarms--an acceptable annoyance for me--but other than that, it's worked quite well.    Problem:  Occasionally I like to play around with Google Translate's Word Lens function, which translates text live from the camera. This is because sometimes it gives humorous results, replacing words that are already in English with completely different words that make no sense there. Here's an example; it said Suave before. But there's no button to take a picture, even though if something funny appears I may want to save it. I could take a screenshot, but I can't really do the screenshot gesture (push a button on the front of the phone along with a button on the side) without moving my phone in a way where it will likely go away. Sometimes I even do the gesture wrong and turn off my screen or exit to the home screen, both of which obviously make it go away.  Solution:  This one was pretty complicated, but satisfying. I won't describe it in exact detail here (if you want that; you can download it below and look at it yourself) but I'll give you a basic description. I created a ""scene"" (basically, a custom layout of items to be displayed on the screen) for a ""camera"" button. This button is automatically displayed as an overlay whenever the Google Translate app is running, and hidden when the app is exited.  When I push the button, it takes a screenshot using the AutoInput plugin, and then displays another scene I created. This one is a dialog box asking if I want to save the screenshot. It displays the screenshot, and asks me if I want to keep or delete it. This is important because if it doesn't get what I want, I'd like to delete it then and not have to look later to do it, and I don't want it just taking up space if it's not worth keeping. Here's what it looks like. (Don't forget to read the text in the middle!)  In case you want to play around with it, you can download the project here! Go into its variables tab to configure it."

If so, Trigger allows a dual tap function as in - you tap the NFC tag once (Assuming you are using one), and it engages the task to do your brightness and so forth.  You then tap it again to revert back to normal.  So in essence, build two tasks, one for the 1st mode and then the other for the second mode reverting things.

In the morning then of course, tasker wakes me by starting to play music, which fades away as soon as I turn on the screen.

It simply switches off WIFI and mobile data and creates a persistent notification which indicates that Sleep Mode is active. The notification has a button which can deactivate Sleep Mode.  The cool part however, is the way the Sleep Mode is activated. Before activating it, Tasker checks if I'm using the phone at the time. If I am, then instead of activating Sleep Mode, it creates a notification which tells me that the Sleep Mode failed to activate. The notification also contains buttons which allow me to snooze the Sleep Mode activation by a certain amount of time (5min, 10min, 15min etc). So depending on the time I choose, it will try to activate the Sleep Mode again after that much time. And again, if I'm using the phone, it will fail and create the notification and so on.   Additionally, Tasker also checks if I'm awake but not using the phone (using the light sensor). If so, then it activates Sleep Mode, but informs me that it has done so by emitting 3 short beeps."

Similar to the other comments it goes into priority mode and since I use cf.lumen I have it go to a specific temperature. If the battery is less than 40 it turns off mobile data (I charge at work rather than home).   Different from others I also have my sms backed up through sms backup restore and then delete them with sqlite3.   Lastly it checks in with my Nest and creates a notification that I can dismiss if I wake up before my alarm.  The sleep mode is disabled by the alarm dismiss (gentle alarm).

This profile will trigger whenever anything is added or removed from the folder so the task will need to handle that. (might not be an issue since you only want to look for mp3s)  Anyway, the task will need to get the newest file (I have code for that if you want to end up delving into this) and determine if the newest file has an extension of mp3, you can get the file name and then split it by a period (.) and see if the last value from the split matches ""mp3"" and then if it does you can start the move process.  The move process is going to be difficult.  You can do things like have the user enter the folder they want it to be in and you can see if it exists and if it does move the file and if it doesn't create the folder then move it.

tasker,3akhjc,maxopotamus1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm... could you elaborate a bit more? I'm just not understanding exactly what you're saying.  Do you mean the music app opens if you don't have a specific app open + headphones in, or you want it to open if your phone is locked or you're on your homescreen when you connect your headphones?  If it's either of those, I'd say there's a few ways of going about this. If it's a specific app you're talking about, you could use a profile that activates using headphones in + selecting 'x' app under state and ticking the invert button (essentially when 'x' app isn't running).  If you're saying you want it to trigger only if your phone is locked/on the homescreen when you plug it in, I've answered a similar question on here about using widgetlocker instead of the system lock screen because widgetlocker can be controlled and monitored with tasker through the 3rd party app menu. Then, use a seperate profile that triggers when you unlock the screen to set %ScreenLock to 1, and another that when the screen is locks, sets %ScreenLock to 0.  So then, in a seperate profile for your music app, you'd use headphone in + variable state (when %ScreenLock ~ 0) to lower vol and open spotify (or whatever music app you're using).  You could even take it a step further, and with the latest version of tasker, control the media app using the different commands under media to say, once the volume is down, and the app is launched, start playing.  If neither of these solutions is what you're looking for, let me know, and just clarify what you would like, and I could help you better."

First would be to see if there is some sort of broadcast intent sent out when this card is sent out (then use Event>System>Intent Received as your profile). Second, if you have AutoNotifications (I don't), you could see if that can intercept the notification of the heavy traffic. Finally, if neither of those work, (assuming you either have a work profile [use an exit task] or leave at the same time each day) you could query google maps using their API to get the arrival time and see if it X minutes longer than normal."

The difficult part about this idea is that the card won't trigger more than once or twice a day so you'd have to try to track the notifications to try to find it.  So you could set a profile to record and save all notifications during a time period and see if you catch one that is about the traffic.

You'd have to get rid of original steps A2-A4. I'm not sure if you have to do other things to it though.  Bonus answer (source): If the four variables %arr1, %arr2, %arr3, %arr4 hold respectively a, b, c and d then we have an array with 4 elements. These variables can be used just like any other, however it is also possible to access them in special ways. Here are some examples:   %arr(#) The number of defined array elements (4 in this case) %arr(#>) The index of the first defined array element, or 0 if none are defined (1). %arr(#<) The index of the last defined array element, or 0 if none are defined (4) %arr(#?b/c) A comma-separated list of the array indices (lowest to highest) with matching values, or 0 if none match (2,3 in the example) %arr(>) The contents of the first defined array element (a) %arr(<) The contents of the last defined array element (d) %arr() or %arr(:) All of the array elements separated by commas (a,b,c,d) %arr(2) or just %arr2 The content of the element with index 2 (b) %arr(2:4) Contents of defined elements with indices 2 to 4 (b,c,d) %arr(:3) All the defined elements with indices up to 3 (a,b,c) %arr(3:) All the defined elements with indices starting from 3 (c,d) %arr(1:2) All the defined elements with indices from 1 to 2 (a,b)"

tasker,3acjiy,fenchai,2,Fri Jun 19 00:18:41 2015 UTC,For temperature you can have a profile of Event > System > Intent Received the the only field you need to add is the first one Action:android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED Then have it trigger some task and the task can check %temperature (which is filled from the received intent) to see if it is over some threshold.

tasker,3acjiy,plepleus,5,Fri Jun 19 01:46:57 2015 UTC,"All right, I'll go into as much detail as I can. Click on the profile tab of tasker, then click the plus sign (+) in the bottom right-hand side.  In the menu that pops up click Event, then in the next one click System, then in the next one click Intent Received.  This will bring up a screen that has a lot of options to enter text, the very top one will have the title Action. In the text field below it type in: android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED Next you can click the top left area and back out of this screen and it will pop up asking you to select an entry task.  Select ""New Task"" and name it something like ""Battery Temp"".  This will bring up an area to setup your task.  But before that, a little detail about the android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED it is an intent.  These are used in android to communicate data between different apps or the system.  Intents have things call Extras which send some data, in this intent there is an extra named 'temperature' (there are others as well).  So tasker converts these into local variables and in this case that is %temperature.  Using %temperature we can add an action to check (Task> If) whether the temperature is over some value (when I checked mine it was around 300). and if it is you can do whatever task you want.  I'm sure this is way more information than you needed but I wanted to make sure it was clear."

tasker,3acjiy,plepleus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:34:41 2015 UTC,while testing you should do an  Alert>Flash of %temperature at the beginning of the task to see where it is then you can adjust your if statement.  I believe the profile should trigger every 30 seconds to a minute.

tasker,3aafz9,cdombroski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'll run through an explanation of what's happening, and hopefully that will help you understand what needs to be done.   Run a Http Get action on the page url that contains the picture you want to use as your wallpaper. The html source of the page will be stored in a variable called %HTTPD. Call Variable Split action until you have a variable that contains just the url for the image you want to set as your wallpaper. In the example the desired image is in the first <img/> tag on the page, so splits are used to create a variable that contains just the source (src) value from that tag. From the user manual:   Example: %VAR contains ""I;like;humus"". After the action Split/%VAR/;/Yes %VAR is replaced with 3 variables %VAR1, %VAR2 and %VAR3 containting ""I"", ""like"" and ""humus"".  Run another Http Get, this time using the variable obtained from the previous step and saving the result to a file on the SD card. You might need to specify server and/or path information before the variable depending on the format of the url in the html. Run Set Wallpaper with the file saved to set the new wallpaper.   The example does some other things to save some extra data and make it available, but these aren't needed for just changing the wallpaper to an image from the internet."

For example, instead of having a ""home mode"" tag that toggles my ringer on and off, I just have a profile that turns the ringer off when I disconnect from my home WiFi network (don't want ""What is Love"" blasting through the office) and turns it back on when I reconnect.  Driving mode through bluetooth connection has already been mentioned, but for those of us who don't have bluetooth in our cars I guess you can use NFC.  The biggest use I can see for NFC tags is for easily sharing things. NFC business cards that write your contact info to the phone or WiFi access tags so guests can easily connect to my WiFi network are where NFC really shines...unfortunately, iPhones don't really like NFC.  Living in the US, that means that NFC business cards and WiFi access aren't all that useful for me :(."

The project way would be to track battery drain rate by checking it every 15 minutes after you leave work using a Profile that runs a Task that subtracts the previous level (which you log the first time then every time the Task runs) from the current level, and basically divides it by 15 (or how many ever minutes you decide the Profile to check) and then literally get it down to the minute how much the Battery is draining.  Then in the same Task you'll need some way to figure out how many minutes are remaining till you get home based on GPS, MPH you're traveling, etc. etc.(a whole other project, but interesting nonetheless) and then decide if based on the current 'drain rate' if the battery will likely go below say 5% or to 0 before you get home  and then alert you and turn on power saving mode."

I could imagine the dongle looking like a new bluetooth device simply because it was powered off just before.  If that's the case, maybe changing the dongle to a different model could help. I guess the dongle change its ID everytime you switch it off and on. To your phone it probably just looks like a brand new dongle everytime you switch it on.  Maybe you could try to create a task that kinda ""searches"" for your dongle and forces it to pair again.  EDIT: Tasker itself doesn't seem to have a task to connect to a specific bluetooth device. On the other hand, the Secure Settings plugin does have a ""BT connect"" functionnality. It seems to use the MAC address of the target device so maybe that would work better. Maybe try to detect when you connect to your car's bluetooth and then use secure settings to switch to the dongle instead.  linkme: Secure Settings"

I should have said in the beginning that I'm pretty new to all of this.  As for the BT dongle, it connects without me having to traditionally ""pair"" it to the phone every time I click on it. I just have to manually go into BT settings to do that, which is what I want to automate."
tasker,3a211o,Tetsuo666,3,Tue Jun 16 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Secure Settings is a plugin that adds features to tasker. You have to install it from the playstore first.  Then you should build a task looking like that:  In the profile tab:   Choose ""State"" > ""Net"" > ""BT near"" In the BT near screen click on the symbol of a magnifying glass. And then pick the BT dongle. When you will get out of that screen tasker will ask you what task that should trigger when it detects the dongle is close by. Choose to do a new task.   The task:   Use the ""Task"" > ""Wait"" task to wait a few seconds before the task is actually triggered. Just to be sure you execute that task only if you remain close to the dongle long enough. This is to prevent the phone from connecting while your barely in range. Add another step to the task in which you choose ""Plugin"" > ""Secure settings"". In the screen that pops up click on the gear symbol. In that screen you will see verything Secure Settings can do. In the first category you should see a ""BT connect"" action. Click on it and set it up on the dongle again. Then press back.   Then please report back on what went wrong, I will try my best to help you troubleshoot this.  Hopefully it will work straight away."

tasker,39y9my,Zazie_Lavender,2,Mon Jun 15 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"Strongly recommend you don't nuke the dalvik cache unless you experience major problems.   I get that it's generally accepted that it's unnecessary and just takes a lot of time to rebuild, but why are you recommending against it? Are there any negative effects of cleaning the Dalvik cache?"
tasker,39y9my,nrq,2,Tue Jun 16 08:51:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know of anything conclusive, but it's capable of causing various bugs in apps. The Dalvik cache stores compiled code, so wiping it tends to slow you down overall, as you force Android to recompile everything.   While this is fine if you make large overhauls to the code stored on the device, like a new ROM, it makes little sense to wipe this cache otherwise. I don't even wipe dalvik across dirty flashes unless I am going to a completely different ROM. Furthermore, since Lollipop runs on the Android Runtime, (ART) clearing the dalvik cache does nothing for you...other than reset the ART and force everything to recompile, losing any performance optimization done at runtime by the JVM."
tasker,39y9my,Zazie_Lavender,2,Tue Jun 16 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"From what I read about ART it doesn't do JIT optimizations at runtime like Dalvik, so we should be safe from slowdowns there. I also don't see a problem with recompiling with ART, as the same code should lead to the same codepaths and ultimately to the same compiled code.  I agree it doesn't make much sense to wipe Dalvik cache if the ROM you flash hasn't changed anything in the ART or Dalvik engines (with the latter being slower first, until everything is optimized), but I don't think it hurts much, either (except for wasted time for something that is unnecessary). Ultimately, if you update an app its Dalvik cache gets rebuilt completely on install, anyways.  If you change ART, like flashing Xposed does, for example, wiping Dalvik cache is absolutely necessary. Luckily the Xposed installer does that for you."
tasker,39y9my,nrq,2,Tue Jun 16 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"It may not hurt, but it doesn't help. If ART is optimizing at compile-time, likely either on install/update, then you waste time by razing /dalvik/ and forcing android to spend up to 20 mins recompiling code. If there's a slowdown, it's probably the ROM...they should file a bug to it's developer.  There's no reason to wipe dalvik outside of major changes...and android usually intelligently handles this on it's own, even across OTA updates. If you're flashing though, a wipe of dalvik never hurt, as it helps avoid issues."

tasker,39rrqb,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"I'm still working on that bit myself which is why I haven't uploaded the scene XML. My plan is:  Tapping a box does the following - tests the month and year text boxes, as well as itself (%element_name) to put together into a string (so like %month %day %year) which then shows up in a new text box (let's call it S box)  A submit button (once the above step is done) tests this new S box. The Month is reverse engineered to get a number (1 through 12) (this is done in a Javascriptlet using indexOf()) and the date is put into a format mm-dd-yyyy.   This is then converted into time (seconds). For what I'm using it for, I'd like to see the number of days until the date I selected on the calendar.  So there's a bit of math involved.   That's really all I'm using it for but it could probably be used for a lot of other things I imagine.   So yeah to answer your question it simply tests the value of the text boxes when it needs the info."
tasker,39rrqb,Ratchet_Guy,2,Mon Jun 15 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"Cool, understand where you're going with this.  I throw in my .02 cents on how to maybe simplify the above process. As you're building each calendar page, (which simply runs that singular Task again) at the beginning of the Task use Array Clear to clear a Global Array called say perhaps %Cal_Dates()  Then as you're populating each field in the Calendar dynamically, you simply add to that Global Array the corresponding date in the format you chose.   From what I can see in your example pic the Global Array names/values when populated would look like:  %Cal_Dates(1) = 05-31-2015 %Cal_Dates(2) = 06-01-2015 %Cal_Dates(3) = 06-02-2015 %Cal_Dates(4) = 06-03-2015 etc edit: fixed this   And when any button is pressed it runs a simple Task that gets that button's name, splits the ""Day"" portion off the front, and uses the remaining number to grab value %Cal_Dates(%day_num) and you'll automatically have that date data.  I recently wrote a snippet of Task code that when called from any Scene element anywhere - grabs the name of the Scene that called the Task as well as the Element Name. Here it is as adapted for this purpose, assuming you build that date array each pass:  Calendar Array Date (1260)  <GET THE SCENE NAME AND ELEMENT CALLING THIS TASK> A1: For [ Variable:%call_item Items:%caller() ]     A2: If [ %call_item ~R ^scene\= ]      A3: Variable Split [ Name:%call_item Splitter:= Delete Base:Off ]       A4: Variable Split [ Name:%call_item(2) Splitter:: Delete Base:Off ]       <SCENE NAME>     A5: Variable Set [ Name:%scene_name To:%call_item2(1) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]        <ELEMENT NAME>     A6: Variable Set [ Name:%element_name To:%call_item2(2) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]     A7: End If   A8: End For   <SPLIT THE ELEMENT NAME i.e. ""Day12""> A9: Variable Split [ Name:%element_name Splitter:Day Delete Base:Off ]   <GRABS THE ""12"" FROM ""Day12""> A10: Variable Set [ Name:%day_num To:%element_name(2) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <USE THAT VALUE TO GRAB ACTUAL DATE FROM  ARRAY> A11: Variable Set [ Name:%exact_date To:%Cal_Dates(%day_num) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   A12: Flash [ Text:The Date You Just Pressed is %exact_date Long:Off ]       So I think that would do it. Probably many other ways but I'm thinking this would be one that works right off the bat, and doesn't need much testing. Could still throw the %exact_date into a Scene field to confirm with a ""Submit"".  Pulling the Scene Name variable %scene_name from %caller isn't relevant in this case, but I left it in there cause, well, it's in there if needed lol."
tasker,39r78k,Lacrymae666,3,Sat Jun 13 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"Ready for this? Ok...here we go...  Just use Action > Variables > Variable Search / Replace  And in the Search field just put a period .  That's it, a single period. Note - you are not searching for a period, as the search field takes a regular expression, where a period represent any character at all.  Then in ""Store Matches In"" make up the name of the Array you'd like it to put all the individual characters in. So you could call it %matches, or, just use the same variable name as the original and it will transform it into an array.  So if you have %myvar = 00123 after running it like this you'd have an array of %myvar() = 0,0,1,2,3  Or if you chose a new name like %my_array it would have the same values %my_array = 0,0,1,2,3"

tasker,39oahk,layzor,3,Sat Jun 13 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Probably can definitely be done, just a little of comparison sleuthing to do.  Basically just setup a test Task that will run UI Query (in the setup config just specify nothing at all, basiclaly going into the config and immediately checking the checkmark and exiting out of it) and that way UI Query will return two main arrays: %aitext() and %aiid()  The text array has the texts of all the elements on the page.  The id array has the id's of all the elements on the page.  Either one of these (or both) are going to show you what YouTube's screen looks like when the 'Recommended' element/text is present. So what I recommend is setting up that test Task to be this:   WAIT 10 seconds  UI Query  Set Clipboard %aitext() , %aiid()  FLASH ""Done""   Then basically from inside Tasker press play, then you've got 10 seconds to switch the screen to YouTube and AutoInput will 'snapshot' what's on the screen, and place it in your clipboard. When you see ""DONE"" flashed, you know it's finished and can proceed with analyzing your test results.  Do it two times, one without the 'Recommended' element present, and again with the 'Recommended' element present. Then take a look at what's in the Clipboard each time (easier seen when pasting it into any text editor etc) and you'll see the difference of the element being present or not present.  The easier one to see is usually the text. It will likely have the word 'Recommended' in there. This is often workable a large percentage of the time, UNLESS, the word 'Recommended' can appear elsewhere on the screen. For example if there are video names present on the screen that say ""Recommend ways to make perfect cookies"" then there could be an issue.  The id way is better since the Recommended element likely has a unique ID, and it will take a bit more comparing the Clipboard test results to find the ID. When you decide which comparison method serves you better or is easier to figure out, in any Task you want to use it in just put:  AutoInput > UI Query  IF %aitext() ~ *Recommended* <do whatever>  <OR>  IF %aiid() ~ *<field id you found>* <do whatever>   NOW, the above is an overall AutoInput UI Query approach to use with just about any app to find these things out.   I took a quick look at YouTube specifically, and it doesn't look to me, at least on my device and my version of YouTube that ""Recommended"" or ""Suggestions"" has a specific field id, but it may on yours. So I think looking for the text wording itself maybe the way to go.  So, here is what I recommend you try first, it uses the 'text' present method, this may just work right away for you:  App>Launch App>YouTube (to get the display to show YouTube, if it's not already showing)  AutoInput > UI Query  (Remember to not specify anything in the setup)  Variables > Variable Join> Variable: %aitext  Joiner:  ,  (comma)  IF %aitext ~ *,Recommend,* OR %aitext ~ *,Suggestions,* <do whatever>      Would look like this. And the reason this would work the best IMO is that after you join the array returned by UI Query using a comma, the word ""Recommended"" or ""Suggestions"" will be wrapped in comma's, and can easily be matched in the IF statement, and any other videos present with those words in it won't effect your matching statement. Since the commas won't be wrapping those words. (i.e. if a video is present that says ""Recommended Way to Make Great Oatmeal Cookies"" Tasker will wrap that whole entire thing in comma's, and it therefore won't trigger the match."

tasker,39oahk,Ratchet_Guy,2,Sun Jun 14 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Glad it worked for you. UI Query is really cool. Can also be used to wait around for a specific word(s) to show up on the screen, this is where you'd specify some word(s) inside the config, and use the ""Timeout"" setting to specify how long UI Query should wait for the words to appear before moving on, if you want it to (and you would check the Continue After Error checkbox to do that i.e. continue your Task if the word doesn't show up after x amount of seconds)."

If that happens, lock and unlock your phone again and it will be fine. Give it a go, maybe you don't have that problem.

tasker,39l34f,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:02:06 2015 UTC,"The way to do this is to keep the device from ever engading the screen lock.  To do this, first you'd set your lock screen to engage at the longest time possible, typically 30 minutes. The setting that looks like this.  Then, use a Profile set at interval of every 28 minutes linked to a Task that uses Secure Settings plugin to wake the screen for a few seconds, which will happen every 28 minutes, and thereby prevent the screen lock from ever kicking in. Let's assume the PROFILE here is named ""Wake Screen"".  Then at 11pm, when your Task runs to turn on the house alarm etc., at the END of that Task, add an action Profile>Status  and choose Disable ""Wake Screen"". So from that point forward, your screen won't be waking up anymore on its own."

If there are tasks which should only be active when the display is on, then turn them on in the display on profile. If there are tasks which should only be on when the display is off, turn them off when the display goes off.  There's no reason to waste battery searching for wifi or doing other stuff when your profiles don't need to be running."
tasker,39kckn,TheDevilsAdvocat,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:15:05 2015 UTC,"First off, Tasks can't be turned off and on. Only Profiles can.  And if you're going to make a Profile for ""Display On"" whether state or event, you're limited to One or Two Linked Tasks.  So if you've got 8 Tasks that should/could be running when the Display is On, you're to need a whole lot of profiles, both for display on and off.  If you're talking about a Task executing depending on whether the display is on or off, Tasker already has a Global Variable for that - %SCREEN, it returns ""on"" or ""off"". So that could be added to any Task or Profile, again though the Profiles are limited to how many Tasks you can trigger.  If what you're talking about if ENABLING or DISABLING Profiles depending on if the display is ON or OFF, then you'd have to set it up as the following:  Profile > Event > Display On   > Task > ""Enable My Display Profiles""  Task ""Enable My Display Profiles""   Action > Tasker > Profile Status > ""Watch For Wifi Near"" > Enable   Action > Tasker > Profile Status > ""Watch For Bluetooth Near"" > Enable   Action > etc etc etc  <then the reverse:>  Profile > Event > Display Off   > Task > ""Disable My Display Profiles""  Task ""Disable My Display Profiles""   Action > Tasker > Profile Status > ""Watch For Wifi Near"" > Disable   Action > Tasker > Profile Status > ""Watch For Bluetooth Near"" > Disable   Action >  etc etc etc"
tasker,39kckn,Ratchet_Guy,-1,Sat Jun 13 22:34:59 2015 UTC,Playing semantics here. You know what I meant as I clarified in my post.  There's no reason to be checking %SCREEN when you can just flip the switch on a profile.
tasker,39kckn,TheDevilsAdvocat,3,Sat Jun 13 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"No I'm not playing anything. There's nothing clear about your post.   As far as just 'flipping the switch' on a Profile - how do you flip a switch'?  You mean going into the Tasker UI manually, or making a shortcut in the homescreen.  In my reply I outlined in code format how it would look to me. So do the same as far as how it would look to you. When, where, and how, is Tasker supposed to determine if the screen is on or not, and then 'flip a switch' to the Profiles?"
tasker,39kckn,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"I concur with Ratchet_Guy. A profile can be turned on and off and a task can't. Three specific profile/task examples would help your case.  On the other hand, the Power help indicates that Display State is classified as an ""Other State"", %SCREEN is dynamic not monitored, which both show that a profile including a context of Display State or Variable Value would check that no later than other checks; ""power is saved by only monitoring for changes in order of the least-power-hungry first"" applies."

tasker,39fve6,idi_idi,3,Thu Jun 11 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"HERE IS SOLUTION  Here is how to do this, and interestingly at the same time - get access to the SMS database for use in Tasker!   First, you're going to need to download this app named ""SMS to Text"". It lets you export from the phone / device's SMS text database, filtered by contact name, date (if you wish), and msg type (in or out), etc. Then open the ""Sms to Text"" app and make your choices. Chose File Type .csv then Export to SD Card. Setup looks like this screen. (Also in the 'settings' choose Unix under newline setting). Then use the below Task to open the .csv file you exported, retrieve a random message, and do as you like with it! As it's setup below - it will Flash a random message as well as create a notification (as the OP wanted to do).   HERE IS LINK TO XML note there is a sample .csv included to test this with.  Get Random SMS to Text Msg  <✔ PHONE NUMBER OF SMS> A1: Variable Set [ Name:%phone_num To:1235551212 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <✔ CONTACT NAME OF SMS> A2: Variable Set [ Name:%contact_name To:Bob Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <✔ SET FILE PATH TO YOUR .csv FILE> A3: Variable Set [ Name:%filepath To:SMStoText/test_random_sms.csv Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <❌END OF USER VARS> A4: Anchor   <↘ BEGIN - ENJOY!

Text:%random_msg Icon:cust_email Number:3 Permanent:Off Priority:3 ]       The only caveat here is that there is a limit to how much data Tasker can handle loading into iteself, so if the message file happens to be too llarge - when exporting using the ""SMS to Text"" app, just select a Date Range to limit the file to a fewer number of messgages.  Also, to fully automate the export process, you could use Tasker and AutoInput say once a week to update/re-export the .csv message file, and then you'll never have to manually open the app again to do an export. The SMS to Text app is super easy to integrate with AutoInput as the settings you left the app with remain there the next time you open it. A few AI clicks is all it takes.  This is also all obviously useful for doing ANYTHING with any SMS message data. Just replace the random part at the end of the above Task with whatever you'd like to do. Also, depending on what options you choose in the export inside SMS to Text app, you could potentially pull ALL messages to/from all contacts within a specified date range etc. and use Tasker to act on them."

It's called ""SMS to Text"" and its advantage to the one mentioned above is that lets you choose a specific contact/conversation. Supports Emoji's.

Add a wait for, lets say 5 seconds at the beginning of the following:  A1: Java Function [      Return:act      Class Or Object:CONTEXT      Function:getSystemService {ActivityManager} (String)      Param:activity ]  A2: Java Function [      Return:list      Class Or Object:act      Function:getRunningAppProcesses {List} () ]  A3: Java Function [      Return:tmp      Class Or Object:list      Function:get {String} (int)      Param:0]  A4: Java Function [      Return:pm      Class Or Object:CONTEXT      Function:getPackageManager{PackageManager} () ]  A5: Java Function [      Return:test      Class Or Object:tmp.processName      Function:toString{String} () ]  A6: Java Function [      Return:info      Class Or Object:pm      Function:getPackageInfo{PackageInfo} (String, int)      Param:test      Param:0 ]  A7: Java Function [      Return:%tmp      Class Or Object:info.packageName      Function:toString{String} () ]  A8: Flash [ Text:%tmp Long:Off ]   Then hit the ""play"" key to test the task and then open the link it Flynx and see what this flashes (you may need to adjust the wait to give yourself enough time).  What this task does, is get the package name of the foreground app, so hopefully this will flash com.flynx or whatever the package name is, and then you can work with this to set your timeout.  Or it will give us an idea of what app is in the foreground when you want to adjust the timeout.  you can also change the '0' to 1, 2, 3, etc. in step A3 to see the recent package names."

Once you add one, there will be a Class of Object field and a Function field. (the return field gets added once you select a function because not all functions return a value.  So for step A1, we want CONTEXT in the Class or Object field, you can type it, or because this is a built-in object you can click the coffee cup and scroll to find it.    Next we can go into the Function field and we could type in the getSystemService function as above, or we can use the magnifying glass and you can scroll to find it or you can start typing the name at the bottom and select it.  Once you select it you'll see that the Return field and a Param field are now added.  However you will also notice that the getSystemService has Object in the curley brackes {}, not ActivityManager as above, you can go ahead and change it using your keyboard.  You can do similar steps for each of the other Java Function actions.  I recommend using the coffee cup and magnifying glass whenever possible because they will only show you available Objects/Functions, helping you not make a mistake.

tasker,39fvuh,letestaccount,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:35:37 2015 UTC,Have you saved the child task before calling it in the parent?
tasker,39fvuh,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"I did indeed. It works outside of tasker, as I found out, so I consider my problem solved"
tasker,39fvuh,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:32:53 2015 UTC,"As was mentioned, you'll need to 'save' the child Task prior to mentioning it in the parent, and all that means is to exit the Tasker UI and then return to it.  Also, in specifying the name of the child Task, use the magnifying glass icon to choose it from a list of all Tasks in Tasker, rather than just typing it in, because maybe there is a weird character in the name you can't see.  Finally, instead of running Parent inside Tasker (by just pressing play) - try placing a shortcut on the homescreen to run Parent, and run it by clicking the Parent icon on the homescreen.   Because sometimes, Tasker isn't 100% accurate running nested tasks/subroutines/subtasks from within the UI itself.  Also, when you change the name of a Task, Tasker DOES automatically update then name anywhere else it is referenced. Because Tasker doesn't internally reference them by name, instead by an ID number, so changing the name doesn't change the ID number Tasker has assigned to it. Kind of like if someone calls you to come over. If you decide your name is now Bob Jones, it's still you they're calling ;)"

tasker,39ch4q,Bevlar,2,Wed Jun 10 21:36:59 2015 UTC,I've played the input tap game. Its fine until you hit a bit of lag and you miss a tap. Then you add a second or two wait in the 'trouble' spots and then you've got a nice long task where it really would be quicker to do it your self.    If you don't mind dropping a bit of cash take a look at autonotification and autoinput.   Autonotification will intercept the update notification and trigger your autoinput task which    Launches TB Clicks each button in tb based on the field names Clears the play store notification from the tray Adds a new notification to let you know its done its thing (optional)    It will take considerably less than 5 hours to setup and the clicks won't happen until the field is onscreen so it can lag as much as it likes without missing a beat.   Edit: words and formatting.   Edit 2: Just reread your post and saw that you were too lazy to use AN. Still the better option though :-)

tasker,39dp5y,Bevlar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:30:25 2015 UTC,This should work. When the app opens the entry task starts tapping on your app. When the app losses focus the exit task runs and stops the tap task.    I use the same setup to switch on GPS when maps is opened and switch off on exit.

As my thinking is - the purpose of disabling the Drag Margin is to make it so Tasks can't be easily messed up or modified while in Task Edit mode.  And that's why no little 'trash can' icon pops up when you long click on the Task. 'Cut' is just as good as using Delete, or even better, since if you realize you made a mistake - you can just 'Paste', and therefore 'Undo' and get the Action back.  Also - as Tasker uses it's own Cut/Paste setup, the Clipboard isn't getting modified in any way when you Cut or Paste an Action."

The button to expand it on my device (Galaxy Note 4) can be clicked by AutoInput>Click>Text>""Quick settings""   I'm not sure if it can be accessed by a field id or x/y point, but if you look around in the original aitext() you can usually find the name of the text of that represents that button, even though that text can't be visually seen when looking at it, AutoInput sees it somewhere.

You can leave out any fields you don't want/need by simply not including them in the variable set actions.  The one final Action that you would put at the end - would be using AutoInput to 'click' whatever button in your Contacts app completes the add process. So on my Galaxy Note 4 that is using AutoInput to click ""Done"".   Or you can click it by hand if you want to review it first. NOTE: This method using AutoShare will accept any format of phone number, even with pauses/extensions so example 123-456-7890,,,345  Also, if you want to try and do it without using AutoShare, still download that Intent file and open it in any text editor, and you'll probably be able to pull out the basic Intent data to use in regular Tasker Intent Action to open Contacts with the phone field populated.

tasker,395h8q,nxvic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:10:22 2015 UTC,I have 2 different bluetooth speakers in my house right now (neither are Sena) but they both have their own dedicated microphones.  I'm only able to get Google Now to recognize audio through one of them and the other doesn't get any audio at all (bluetooth or phone mic).

tasker,397ow3,necromundia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell you'll likely need AutoInput, here it is:   Set AutoVoice to Always Listening, or, create some Action that triggers AutoVoice to prompt you to speak Take the AutoVoice results and get the playlist name etc. So your Regex would be something like (?:Add Song To)(?: )(?<list_name>[a-zA-Z\ ]{3,20}) Use Tasker to open music player or bring to foreground Use AutoInput to click your way to the Add to Playlist screen. (Just trial and error one step at a time for this one on your music player) When you get to the list of all the playlists, use AutoInput to click on the one you want as retrieved from AutoVoice in the %list_name variable   Only other caveat is if the list of playlists is long, and the one your want isn't on the screen, you'll have to use AutoInput's Scroll Forward to scroll through it until the playlist name you want appears on the screen (which you'd determine by use AutoInput's UI Query between each scroll).  One potential way around steps 3 thru 5 is if there's an Intent somewhere to run from within Tasker's Intent Action that can trigger the add directly and name the playlist. Best way to find this is Google Search or contact the developer of the music app."

With Notification Center, I have several app-specific Snooze options, like save a notification until the first time I check my phone after a certain time of day or stop pushing Hangouts notifications until the next time I check the app. I have several contextual menus with AutoPebble that include things like Loud, Silence, Wake Phone (for easy Google Now voice triggers), and many of the things I'll mention below. I have a generic reminder set up so if I can't get to my phone to type something specific, I can still get a notification in 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours reminding me that there was something I was supposed to do. I can ring my phone or tablet if I can't find them.  I have basic control for my Nexus Player, like media buttons and launching certain apps.

tasker,39480u,the7key,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"I just read that too. Basically, the task, profile, etc is loaded into the app but is not visible in the UI. You can interact with it using the Perform Task action."
tasker,39480u,sbd01,2,Tue Jun 9 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"FIGURED IT OUT.  Thanks for responses here and /u/the7key pointing about 'active configuration live/running' that Pent talked about.  So - here's the scoop on the way this works. I was HOPING that this was a way to import Tasks that permanently stay as Tasks, just as if you'd manually imported it. And that would open up the possibility as I mention in another thread of having a ""master"" device that could export, and then satellite device could import, so everything's sync'd up.  Looks like that's NOT the case though, and here's how it seemingly works -   When you Read File .xml into %var, then Import Data>Task and choose the data %var - the imported 'Task' shows up only 'temporarily' and can only be run from OUTSIDE Tasker until you go back into the Task UI, then POOF - it's gone. (i.e. You won't be able to test this from within the Tasker UI.)     That probably confusing so I'll explain it another way. When you Import Data > Task and the Task .xml is imported, it doesn't run right away or anything. However you can use Perform Task to run it using it correct name that it was 'imported' as, and you can keep using Perform Task to run it, as long as you're outside the Tasker UI.   So if you have two shortcuts on your desktop. The first shortcut's called Import and runs a hard-coded Task you created that does its Import thing and Imports a Task named ""Set XVAR"" (that does nothing but set XVAR to 12345).  Once you run that shortcut, from thereafter anywhere else, in any other Task/Profile in Tasker, you can Perform Task ""Set XVAR"" and it will work. You can test this by placing a second shortcut on your desktop to a Task that does nothing but Perform Task>""Set XVAR"".  And it will run the Set XVAR Task that is temporarily hanging around in Tasker, until you open Tasker as you normally would to edit anything, and that imported Task disappears from memory.   This can be confirmed by exiting back out of Tasker and trying the second shortcut again and you will get an error saying ""No Task Exists named Set XVAR"".     So in a nutshell, this new Import Data Action can load a Task, that will exist and can be run using Perform Task, from anywhere as long as you're not in the app Tasker, unless/until you  open Tasker again, at which point whatever you imported then vanishes. So you can't see it or edit it, it's just...gone. (It also disappears on device re-boot).  It's so bizarre that at this point I'm hard pressed to find a use for this, but I'm sure there will be some ideas, so, throw em out there!"

tasker,39113t,jfedz,2,Mon Jun 8 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"I think that, but ALSO - mirroring Tasker configurations on multiple devices!  For example someone on here in a recent thread brought up that they develop all kinds of Tasker Tasks to deploy on co-worker or employee phones, and wanted an easy way to update anything on his device, and basically have all the other devices mirror the updates.  With this, it makes it completely possible! Previously only running AutoInput inside Tasker itself would be the way, and that's pretty risky IMO. With this, if I'm interpreting it right, every night at say 00:01 (or via an SMS as the example suggests) - a device could pull down a full Tasker config from the cloud, or even just certain individual Task(s), and then import them automatically.   So you could deploy Tasker on any number of devices and basically refine and update them all at once with any Task/Profile/Anything updates you make on your singular device. Brilliant actually.          EDIT: I get where the MD5 hash comes into play. Took me a minute to see what Pent was getting at. Basically, if any device is going to download and install a new Task or full Config, it's possible that the .xml could become corrupt or be missing characters, or an incomplete download, and then Tasker downloads it, attempts to install it, and the whole thing is whacked.  So what Pent is saying (I think) is that if you are the person let's say that is holding the 'master' device and want to give updates to 'satellite' devices, before uploading or sending the .xml file to the satellite devices, you would run an MD5 hash on the xml to be sent (which gets you a unique string that would change if even one character changed in the xml file later on).  Basically it acts as a key. So you could send the key separately in a text or email, or even if the satellite devices were using DropSync or something - put the MD5 key in a text file inside the same folder as the new .xml  So Tasker then Action>Read File the new .xml to a Variable, and at first (before doing any importing) runs an MD5 convert on that file data Variable. Then it compares it to the MD5 key that was sent or downloaded separately. If they match, the receiving device knows that it has the full and correct new .xml file and can then proceed with the import.  So it would look something like:  <Device receives a text like ""Tasker XML Update,77de1e54728f039b250b931edfe2790a""  PROFILE: Received Text ""Tasker XML Update,"" ENTER TASK: Set Variable: %msg  Value: %SMSRB Variable Split: %msg  Splitter: , Set Variable : %md5_key Value: %msg(2)  <Perform DriveSync or DropSync or whatever here to where xml is>  Read File: ""/downloads/taskerupdates/etc/new.xml"" To Variable: %new_xml_data Variable Convert: %new_xml_data Function: To MD5  Store Result In: %xml_md5  Import Data - Type: Configuration  Source: Variable  Variable: %new_xml_data  IF  %md5_key  eq  %xml_md5   And I think that would do it!"

Once installed, create a Tasker profile triggered by an AutoShare event (Add profile > Event > Plugin > AutoShare). Now there are multiple ways you can go about this depending on your setup. If this is your only AutoShare use case, you can simply leave the configuration empty and go right into the task procedure. Otherwise if you prefer using the command menu (basically pops up another list of options to which you can tie specific tasks) you can set up a command filter. If you have multiple AutoShare use cases but each one is only related to a specific app, you can create separate profiles, specifying the corresponding app under Sender Package. Lastly, if, like me, you have multiple use cases, but one of them is a catch-all for every app, you can, again, leave the event configuration blank, but set up an if else condition using the %assender or %assendername variables in your task procedure. Then basically, all you're gonna want is a single action: Add action > System > Send Intent.

I don't think location settings automatically reset, so...  You've got to make a separate Task to do the opposite of what you did initially.  Then in your Profile (that detects maps being open) long click on the Task you selected to trigger with it, choose Add Exit Task, and then select your new Task that put things back where you want them.  Basically this says, when Maps is open -> do the Enter Task. Then after that, when Maps is not open -> do the Exit Task."
tasker,38xmuw,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"Nice. That worked thanks. Another question, what about delaying the exit action? So if I check my music while nav is running it won't immediately loose lock. Wait like a min to take the action"
tasker,38xmuw,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Welcome, glad that worked for you.  As to your other question, yes adding a wait statement at the start of your exit Task would be the first part. Problem being after it waits a minute it's still going to flip things back regardless of what's going on, since I dont think that a Enter Task re-triggering then stops any Exit Task that was running. It might, but if it doesn't...  After your wait statement in the Exit Task, you want to add an IF statement to the Action(s) that are resetting your settings. And that would be to only perform those Action(s) after the minute is up AND the current window (%WIN) hasn't switched backed to maps and basically that is:  IF %WIN neq Maps   Where %WIN is Tasker's built in variable for the name of the current window. That's assuming that when your Navigation is open the name of the window as reflected in %WIN is ""Maps"". To find out for sure - at the beginning of your Enter Task, temporarily add an Action>Alert>Flash %WIN  This will tell you the exact name that Tasker sees when your Maps/Nav is open and you'd put that in place of the word Maps above.  Your final Exit Task Action would have the IF statement looking something like this.  The final icing on the cake is in the Task Edit screen for your Exit Task - at the bottom there's a little slider icon for Task Settings. In there is a menu for 'Collision Handling'. Set it to ""Abort Existing Task"". This makes sure that every time the Exit Task is triggered, it starts over with the minute timer from the beginning."

tasker,38xt40,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Cool, glad you found it!  And what you're working on is a good use of AutoLaunch, I use something similar with AutoVoice/AutoLaunch combo to launch apps. I like the idea of using it to launch other Tasks and shortcuts.  In your implementation of it, specifically the Tasks part, are you going to use Perform Task to just sort of wing it that the voice input will line up with the Tasks name(s), or are you going to use a pre-defined list of voice controlled Tasks that you'll reference in some of the Task logic?"
tasker,38xt40,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"Each Perform Task has an if statement that matches the spoken command with a hardcoded name ...   ... I use regexp so I can do ad-hoc stuff in the task, matching say the first and second words of the command and handling the remaining  the words in the task. Searching music, radio or twitter works like this.  I like to wrap apps inside tasks, to do things like locking them when away from home, or using Autoinput  to zap to a screen within the app.  There's copy-paste ugliness so I can provide return status (command recognised or not) so I can daisy chain tasks and stop when one is matched.  I can rerun the last successful command with a special command.  There's also some debug inspired insanity to stash %WIN in a notification and treat that as a command, which I can invoke with Notification Click or voice.  It's evolving, it isn't brilliant programming, but crikey, it is fun. :-)"
tasker,38xt40,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I agree that the hardcoded name is the way to go, otherwise all kinds of funky stuff could happen.  Using AutoVoice, especially if you're familiar with Regex, is great, as the JoApps Regex implementation is excellent, supporting matching and non-matching groups along with named groups that automatically show up as variables. For example here's my Regex for my launcher app/Task:  (?<action_word>launch|open|close)(?: )(?:application|app)(?: )(?<appname>[a-zA-Z ]{4,16})$   Whereby %action_word and %appname are immediately available.  The neat thing about AutoLaunch is you can get away with saying only part of an app name and it figures it out best it can. So for example if you want to launch ES File Explorer you can just say ""Open E S File"" or even just ""Open Explorer"" and it usually gets it right."
tasker,38xt40,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"*** boggles at that regexp ***  Google Now really needs an escape mechanism to guarantee the matched text is sent to AutoVoice, instead of being sent to the ""magic words"" logic.  For example I have ""open music foobar"" to list any music on my phone that matches ""foobar"". This usually works, unless Google Now decides that it has heard of ""foobar"" and attempts to play music from Google Play. Aargh!  My current ""safe word"" alias for open is ""request"", but should Google Now hijack that I'll have tosay something ridiculous like ""sausage <appname>"" ...  I think ""Tasker Now"" addresses this but I'm invested in AutoVoice!"
tasker,38xzny,SouthernNorseman,2,Sun Jun 7 20:18:43 2015 UTC,A profile that is set by a state will happen once when that state is achieved. Then it will perform the exit task when the state is lost. You shouldn't have any issues using the state to trigger tasks.  Use state>power>any for any time you want something to happen when the car is powered on. Then use the exit task for wherever the car is powered off.
tasker,38xzny,hardonchairs,2,Sun Jun 7 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters anytime you say ""when not"" it sounds like you need to use an Exit Task for that, and anytime you use an Event Profile Context, you can't add an Exit Task.  So you've got to stick with States, and then setup Enter and Exit Tasks.  Then inside those Tasks you'll likely have to setup some variables and some IF statements to figure out the things you want to do.  And you'll likely need separate Profile(s) just to handle the variables. For example a for face up/down would be   Profile>State>Sensor>Orientation>Face Up   ENTER Task - Set Variable %FaceUp Value: YES   EXIT Task - Set Variable %FaceUp Value: NO   Also, as far as Events go, I don't think there's not any 'Power Connected' Event. Just a change in battery level, battery full, or overheating.   So you've got to sort of sort it out or plan it out in your head or on paper the things you want to do, and how to do them, in a slightly different way."

Which leads to the question - when ZR5K prompts, does it pop-up any kind of window/overlay or a notification or anything at all indicating it is prompting?"
tasker,38vtpu,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:53:33 2015 UTC,Sorry should have clarified. Both Spotify and Zombies play at the same time. Can't hear because Spotify is too loud.
tasker,38vtpu,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:55:12 2015 UTC,"Ok. So when the other app is trying to prompt, does it do anything at all that can be 'seen', like popup a little avatar, a notification, a window, anything?  And if it doesn't, can you set it to do something like that in its settings? (The zombie app?) What we're looking for is something Tasker can spot or see when that app is trying to prompt.   Just it co-playing on the media streaming with no other noticable activity might be hard to sort out, so if there's something else to spot, that would be good."
tasker,38vtpu,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:03:25 2015 UTC,Unfortunately not. There's a permanent push notification that stays on during the duration of the run. And there's hardly anything in the settings.
tasker,38vtpu,Bevlar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yeahh, that's an issue. Unless it send out some kind of ""Intent"" when its prompting (which you could contact the app developer about) it's hard to differentiate what app is doing what on the same media stream.  As a decent solution to the problem, I would probably say if the phone's in a somewhat accessible location, you could use AutoInput to remap one of the volume keys to be a play/pause for Spotify, so anytime ZombieLand is trying to talk to you, you can just tap the volume key(s) and pause Spotify, then hit it again to resume.  Also you might want to contact the developer of the app and tell him your issue. It basically has to do with which app is maintaining 'Audio Focus'."
tasker,38vtpu,hawken50,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:51:38 2015 UTC,"Might be worth contacting the Zombie Run dev and request that he add an option to set voice commands to notification sounds.

To get rid of this, long click on any Profile you've got involved in the process, then click the little slider icon that pops up. It brings you to a list of Profile settings for that individual Profile and on the list you should see a checkbox named ""Restore Settings"" or something to that effect.  By default it is checked and what you want to do is UN-check it. Do this for any Profiles you've got involved in changing these volumes, etc. and hopefully this fixes your problem.

tasker,38uu33,falseprecision,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:10:13 2015 UTC,"And....??  That is actually exactly my complaint. There shouldn't be a need for an Exit Task to change anything. Once you change something with an Enter Task, it should stay changed by default, period.  The fact that Tasker designated 'certain' settings to flip back on it own (those settings with the little cog wheel icon) is something that belongs in Beginner Mode.  Because anyone who has any programming background would expect, that when something happens, that makes something else happen, it STAYS that way, unless acted upon by the programmer in the future.   And that is in fact the way Tasker works with the vast majority of every other device setting that can be changed. Who are the makers of Tasker to decide which settings should be automatically flipped back on their own, by default without unchecking that box that is rather hidden in the Profile settings.  If I don't create an Exit Task, ALL setting(s) should stay where I adjusted them to on Enter, unless/until i decide differently and program it as such."

This may not be the most efficient way, but here's what I did:  Tasker's ""File Modified"" event can in fact monitor whole folders, so I set that up on the Nexus Player to monitor the folder where Screenshot Ultimate drops its screenshots. You can set the way in which Screenshot Ultimate names its screenshots within the app so I called them Nexus_Player_Screenshot(Incremental Number, a variable within the app). I then set Tasker to react to the creation of a new one and executing a task that adds 1 to Tasker variable %Screenshotnum (a running count within Tasker that should match SU's running count) and sending file Nexus_Player_Screenshot%Screenshotnum.png to my phone with AutoRemote.   Ultimately pretty simple once I got all the parts conceptualized in my head. My best work with Tasker comes when I get an idea, mess around with it for a few minutes, and come back to execute it a few hours later when it's sorted itself out in my mind."
tasker,38stfs,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"Excellent!  That was going to be my next suggestion, was to monitor File Modified. Interesting that it works with a whole folder, and very creative using the variable name. Hopefully though they never get 'out of sync'.  When I was looking into the File Modified Event context it says that in order to monitor if the file is modified it has to ""already exist when the Tasker UI is exited"" meaning basically that if you wanted to monitor the file and not the directory - you'd have to keep the screenshot filename the same all the time and just keep over-writing it on the Nexus Player  Not a big deal on the phone side since as AR receives each file it can rename it and save it in some sequential format on the phone. But on the Nexus Player side it would just keep over-writing the same screenshot so you wouldn't have a directory full of screenshot on the Player.  As a note when using AR to send files, the params/commands before and after the =:= don't really matter much, as long you have a keyword somewhere to have the AR Event watch for on the receiving end. Then all files sent along are in the arfiles() array. So if you want to do something with just a single file, its path on the receiving device is arfiles(1) which usually corresponds to a AutoRemote subfolder, where AutoRemote stores any files it receives whether you do something with them or not.   Therefore it's typically good to check this folder every now and then, to see if AutoRemote has been piling up a bunch of files you really have no use for."

Also disable this profile as the last action. 6- On the task that sent your ""Checkin"" message, have a wait(maybe 10 seconds), then ""If %PCLive Isnt Set, do WoL."" Depending on your EG setup, you may need to disable the profile mentioned in #5 here so you don't have a repeat of that portion when your PC gets the status check message after it boots up.

If you just want to check whether your computer is on, then a ping from your phone can do it.   Set up Tasker and AutoRemote so that it sends a message to the PC. In EventGhost, setup a macro which reacts to that received message. EG can send a reply to your phone which you can then parse with Tasker.  To give you an example, I can ping my Laptops from my phone, or my phone from my laptops using this. The first message is simple, it's just the word ""Ping"" and the name of the device sending it. The receiving device responds to that device with some values about current status, like Battery Percent, and in the case of my phone, Pending Notifications as well.   Hope this helps!"

tasker,38r7u3,ryoendeprouw,2,Sat Jun 6 03:39:15 2015 UTC,I don't know how AR receives replies but it should be in one of those predefined variables. I'm assuming you can get to the message itself so I'll explain how to parse the text.   You can have EG send a message like   MSG FROM PC:ON  And in Tasker you copy the message into a local variable. Then use Variable Split with ':' as the delimiter. That will give you an array. With an If condition check if the second element of the array is the word ON. If it is your PC is on!

And the ""~R"" stands for the ""matches regex"" option, right?  Also, on the AutoInput Action, does it matter what length of timeout I code in? I currently have it still at the 20 second timeout.

Rather than Regex it I'd go for %WIN ~ *high volume* which is basic match for the words high volume anywhere in there.  The timeout doesn't make much of a difference here. What its for is basically how long AutoInput will hang around waiting for OK to appear on the screen. If after 20 seconds it doesn't see it, the Task move on to whatever's next.  Since the Task doesn't even trigger unless OK is already on the screen in the popup window, the timeout at 20 seconds is fine.  On the Exit Task there can't be one since an Event Context is used.

This will work with the Google when you say ""OK Google"" and typically works fast enough to raise the volume before Google gets around to speaking its response.  First download the Tasker plugin named ""Tasker Now"" which is a play on words of Google Now of course. Anyhow this plugin is a unique little item that fills a specific niche of intercepting whatever is entered or spoken into Google and running some Tasks(s) based on it.   It's typically used to run a Task based on some words being detected. It's sort of like AutoVoice but uses Google to trigger it. Annyways, for this purpose you want it to trigger when you say ANYTHING at all into OK Google, which is super easy to setup.  Just make your Profile Event>Plugin>Tasker Now and set it up to recognize this text/code:  ^.*   Then use the menu beneath it to choose Regular Expression. Link it to whatever Task(s) you want to use to raise the volume. On my device Note 4 Lollipop it usually manages to raise the volume before Google speaks its response.  Also to ensure that it has priority over anything elses going on in Tasker - long click on the Profile after you create it to access Profile settings (slider icon) and set the Profile Priority to 9 or 10 so that this Profile is always on top of watching for this to catch it fast enough.          EDIT: PUT TOGETHER THE WHOLE PROFILE AND TASK(s) FOR THIS  DOWNLOAD THE XML  Just remember you need the 'Tasker Now' plugin."
tasker,38orha,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:41:32 2015 UTC,Any suggestions on how to set the volume to its original state after you're done with Google now?
tasker,38orha,thrakkerzog,3,Fri Jun 5 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"First figure out what stream Google Now is playing through. Probably media stream, so that volume would be %VOLM.   In the Task where you raises the volume, make the first Action:  Set Variable: %orig_vol Value: %VOLM   Then at the end of the Task once Google is finished speaking, which AFAIK you can't really figure out exactly when, unless it sends some Intent out on the Broadcast Receiver, which is a question for someone else on here.  So the solution is at the end of the Task wait perhaps say 10 seconds. That should be enough time for Google to blab just about anything. Then set your media volume back to %orig_vol that you logged at the beginning of the Task.  So last two Actions in your Task would be:  WAIT 10 seconds  Set Media Volume - Value: %orig_vol"

And there is a two Action Task developed by someone on here (think it was /u/plepleus) that can detect if music/sound is playing through the media stream and return true or false.  SO, this can be used in a loop to find out when Google Now is done speaking, and then return volume to its initial level.

tasker,38qkbp,Magicalmarshmallow,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"To your Profile that runs 7am to 1030pm simply add a context (by long clicking on the existing context) and add context Application>Airwire>Invert  And invert is the little button at the bottom. So that means the profile will only trigger if Airwire isn't running. If it is running, the Profile does nothing.  For the second scenario you'd create a Profile with time context of 22:30 and again App>Aiwire>Invert and link it to your 'Wifi off' Task/Action. Again this will trigger the Profile if time is 22:30 and Airwire ISN'T running.  NOW - something to keep in mind is that the 'Application' Profile Context detects an app running in the foreground. If you're trying to detect if it's running at all anywhere on the device (which can be problematic on its own since some apps running don't appear on the Recent Apps list etc.) you need to use a plugin called KC Process Running.

tasker,38olgz,jwilliams991,3,Fri Jun 5 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"It click on just about anything it can see (or you can see) on most screens. There's some exceptions but they're usually individualized to the device/OS.  One big added advantage is that it works at light speed, clicking things faster than you could ever click them.  I used it for a million things. Here's one example - Whenever I take a screenshot AutoNotification catches the notification (and initiates the touch action as if I'd touched it) and then initiates AutoInput to choose my favorite image editing app from the share pop-up menu, so technically actually DOES launch an app in this case, then once the app is open, AutoInput clicks on the options menu, chooses Edit, and then chooses Crop, then temporarily realeases control to me in order for me to crop the image to my liking.  Right before it releases control to me, Tasker has a tiny Scene popup with a Proceed button that hangs around till I'm done cropping. When my crop is to my satisfaction, I press my little Proceed button, and AutoInput again pulls down the options menu in my image editor app, chooses 'share', then choose 'Imgur', then clicks the button to 'upload' once the Imgur dialog pops up, and as soon as the Imgur 'complete' dialogue shows up - AutoInput clicks 'copy link to clipboard'.  So in a nutshell, I take a screenshot, I'm quickly in crop, I crop, and a few seconds later my image is on Imgur with the link to it in my clipboard.  Also AutoInput CAN run in the background, often with the screen off and locked, but it depends on the screen. For example with the screen ON I can get AutoInput to toggle Airplane mode on/off at will with a simple Task. That Task will also run with the screen off UNTIL the final stage where it needs to click the final on/off button. So it varies depending on what's on the screen.  Search YouTube and the official JoApps website for many examples."

tasker,38nl1a,Ratchet_Guy,3,Fri Jun 5 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"Very slick! That's a really neat idea.  However on the whole appending the file with a newline, just wanted to add a caveat there:  Text messages can come in with newlines inside them. So, if all you want to do with the text file is to read it visually by opening it with any text file reader, then there's no issue since you'll just see things in an easily readable manner to the human eye, especially if when you write to the file you add an extra newline to space things out a bit better, and even include the sender's name and timestamp.  HOWEVER, if you ever want the ability to read the data back into Tasker, when you read the text file it returns the result as a string which you then have to split. And if you split at the obvious 'newline' as your splitter, it's going to take any text that contained newlines (lets say 5) and make it look like 5 separate text messages instead of the one it should be.  So the solution would be when writing to the text file to append a character that would likely never be found in a text msg. So it could be some foreign language character or a symbol like € etc.   Would look something like this  That way when you bring it back into Tasker (or anything that reads it) you would split it at €%newline to make sure each individual text message remains intact."
tasker,38pvcm,tadabutcha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"Zooper integrates great with Tasker. I've used it for so many things, including what you're trying to setup.  Unfortunately what you're trying to setup is very complicated to explain, so I'm going to over-simplify here.  Every single rich text field you want to set in Zooper using data sent over from Tasker has to reference a unique Zooper variable (which I think you're already aware of) that is populated by Tasker.  So if you have 3 rich text fields in Zooper each assigned to display:  #TAPPA#  #TAPPB#  #TAPPC#   You'll have to set each of those with individual Plugin>Zooper actions in Tasker. You have to run every single one as an individual action (rather than in any kind of loop) because unfortunately you can't dynamically name the Zooper variable within Tasker.  As far as moving things up in order, you can do that using Tasker by utilizing the above and just figuring it out, etc.  But the HARD part, that it took me some time to find a solution to, is how to send data BACK TO TASKER from Zooper. Since as it's setup right now, Tasker can set Zooper data/vars, but all Zooper can do is run a Tasker Task by setting the Module On Tap to run a Tasker Task. And you can't pass it any vars like %par1 or %par2 which sucks.  So..what I though of is a rather universal / scalable solution. I created Tasks in Tasker with Task Names:  Zooper Clicked 1  Zooper Clicked 2  Zooper Clicked 3   These all have to be separate Tasks for the reasons I stated above. So if you have 10 rich text fields in Zooper that want Tasker to react to, you're going to have to make 10 Tasks. No big though, just clone the Tasks.  And what does each Task do? It set a Global Variable I named simply %ZooperClicked to 1 or 2 or 3 or whatever.  Then I have a Profile that watches for Event>Variable Set>%ZooperClicked  And whenever that variable is set, it means something was clicked in Zooper, and it's corresponding Tasker Task was run, which in turn set that Variable.  Then based on the value of %ZooperClicked, and Task or part of a Task or (whatever) happens. And as soon as that Task is finished, it uses Variable Clear>%ZooperClicked to 'reset' the variable, so the Profile can wait for the next time something is clicked in Zooper.  So in a nutshell, you're going to populate the Zooper text fields with the individual var set Actions. Then when one is clicked Tasker will be watching for what number has been Set in %ZooperClicked. Based on that Tasker will shuffle/re-order an array or do whatever with the data and push a whole new/modified set of data back to Zooper.  It's like a big long loop pinging back and forth. The only thing that would make it simpler would again be if Zooper could simply send over %par1 %par2 while sending it's Tasker action over, or even better - if Zooper had an OnTap option to 'Set Tasker Variable' instead of just running a Task. Maybe in a future update perhaps.  In summary here's some pics of all that stuff I've been talking about:  PIC 1  PIC 2  PIC 3  PIC 4"

I always put them at the end of my task because I don't know how to just skip them if such and such isn't true and go on to the next command in the task list.    Use ""End If"" at the end of the stuff you want to happen if the condition is true.  If something is true: stuff if true End If stuff that still happens either way  For your first part, yes it looks like you'll have to make your own variable, I don't see a built in one for charging. It's not really that inefficient compared to the fact that Tasker is polling stuff like that constantly. So just set an enter task for state>power>power-any to set a variable to 1, then an exit task to set that variable back to 0. Just make sure that variable has a capital letter so it's global. Then check it just like you said."
tasker,38mjjh,hardonchairs,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"You're spot on with using a Profile to toggle 0/1 when the phone is charging or not, then checking for it later. As there's no built-in variable in Tasker that monitors 'charging or not' so you couldn't run a Task or Action just to check it.  To skip over any segment of any Task anywhere and jump to another section, just use Action>Task>Goto and in the Goto setup you'll see a menu to choose Action Number, Label etc etc.  So you could have:  If %myvar = TRUE   Goto Label ""PART 2"" Else if %myvar = FALSE   Goto Label ""PART 3"" Else    Flash ""%myvar isn't true or false""    Stop End if      And as far as Labels go, at the very very bottom of every Action, there's an option to set a label for that Action, to make it easier to see, and also address using the Goto Action. Since as you add/remove/change positions of Actions, the Action Number(s) are always changing, and using Goto Action# then won't work right.  An even better setup to divide your Task into 'Sections' with out attaching Label names to specific Actions (again since you may be moving them around) is to use Action>Task>Anchor which simply lets you specify a Label name for that section of your Task.   Anchors are probably one of the little known features in setting up Tasks. But are invaluable for designating 'sections' of Tasks that you need to jump to using Goto, since no matter what changes you make to Actions, whether re-ordering them or changing the Action itself, the Anchor always remains the same and you can drag it up/down very quickly to setup sub-sections of your Task."

For example, I have a profile for sleeping that if I shake my phone, it will turn the screen on with a white box with time and battery percent to act as a dim flashlight.  My problem is that I use Next lock screen, and when I activate the profile, the screen will come on, but it will only show the lock screen.  I don't have a direct way in Tasker to disable the Next lock screen so that it shows my light box instead.  So what I had to do was use Tasker to call up the Next configure screen and then use AutoInput to hit the right buttons and switches to turn it off when my sleep profile triggers.  When the profile exits, it does the reverse and reactivates my lock screen.  I would have considered this to be something that Tasker couldn't do on its own, but Autoinput makes it possible."

This gets the top photo from /r/hardbodies then saves a backup of it (in case I really like a wallpaper and want to use it later) then changes the lock screen.   Note 1: Root Required! Edit: Also requires Secure Settings!  Note 2: I am on Lollipop but this task has worked for me since kitkat.  Note 3: you need a folder called Wallpapers in your downloads folder.  Note 4: You can change which subreddit it pulls from by modifying the first action. where it says Server:Port change the part after /r/hardbodies
tasker,38e0kc,zoomzip,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:24:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a simple answer no root required. In fact I use this every day to switch out a whole bunch of wallpapers every six hours.  Anyhow make a folder somewhere that has your lockscreen wallpaper(s).  If it's just one wallpaper, name it ""wallpaper.jpg"" or whatever. Then in Tasker - setup whatever Profile trigger you want (time based etc.) and then in the Task use Copy File to move your new wallpaper (wherever you're getting it from i.e. the web or another folder on your device) over to where ""wallpaper.jpg"" is and in the process rename the file you're copying to ""wallpaper.jpg"" so in essence you're just over-writing the existing file.  This should then cause your device to pull this same file name for the lock screen, but in essence the image is new since you re-wrote it.  I setup my LockScreen to rotate between six different wallpapers and I use Tasker to constantly replace those six with a new random assortment throughout the day. Here's the outline:  Random Lockscreen Wallpaper (625)  <How many wallpapers is the stock lock screen rotator currently set to cycle through> A1: Variable Set [ Name:%total_wallpapers To:6 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <CHOOSE SOURCE IMAGE FOLDER - FULL PATH AUTO PULLED INTO ARRAY %source_image_list> A2: List Files [ Dir:/Files Match: Include Hidden Files:Off Use Root:Off Variable:%source_image_list ]   <CHOOSE DESTINATION FOLDER> A3: Variable Set [ Name:%destination_folder To:/sdcard/dynamic_wallpapers/ Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <DESTINATION FILE PREFIX> A4: Variable Set [ Name:%filename_prefix To:dynamic_wallpaper_ Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <DESTINATION FILE SUFFIX> A5: Variable Set [ Name:%suffix To:.jpg Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]   <--- BEGIN ---> A6: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:1 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ]   <RANDOMIZE THE LIST> A7: Array Process [ Variable:%source_image_list Type:Shuffle ]   A8: For [ Variable:%count Items:1:%total_wallpapers ]     A9: Copy File [ From:%source_image_list(%count) To:%destination_folder%filename_prefix%count%suffix Use Root:Off ]   A10: End For"

In most cases, an app 'staying open' doesn't drain the battery at all and 'killing' it and reopening it later results in MORE power lost, not less. The only exceptions I can think of for this would be something that has to be constantly running (and so has an active notification in the notification shade) like a torrent downloader, or something that's actively connecting to GPS.  Likewise, Bluetooth is generally pretty low power, but the 'startup' sequence of it might actually be a high power 'seek' of the area around it, which might result in more power lost over time if you keep turning it back on every 10 minutes."

You can simply add as many profiles named myTrustedDevice as you want, each with its own context(s) (i.e. Bluetooth Connected), and as long as one of them is active your screen lock PIN will be disabled.  The exit task for myTrustedDevice includes a 1 minute wait, allowing 1 minute for transition from one trusted condition to another before the PIN is enabled.

As far as I know, you can only put icons in the status bar. So if you wanted to show a time, you would need an icon for that. If you made a series of icons, you could store them and change the icon with each update to the notification."
tasker,3894pz,JustRollWithIt,2,Tue Jun 2 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"It would be ideal, but I was afraid it might be impossible... (I guess an app like Stopwatch & Timer--which does display the minutes remaining--has a series of icons, but I'm not about to make all those.)  Would you mind explaining a bit more about how scenes might work in this case? I'm not very familiar with that side of Tasker."
tasker,3894pz,JustRollWithIt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:04:28 2015 UTC,Sure. I would create a scene with just a text box to show time remaining. You could also include a button to start/stop the timer.  You could have the button toggle a variable to enable/disable the timer. A profile could listen for that change and trigger the loop to actually countdown a variable for the time. The textbox would just display that variable that is being counted down.  Create the scene as a blocking overlay and position it wherever you want.
tasker,3894pz,creative_name_here_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds promising; I'll have to look into scenes a bit more. Still wish there were a more straightforward way of doing this, though...it doesn't seem like it ought to be that hard"
tasker,3894pz,creative_name_here_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Bouncing off the idea of it not necessarily being in the status bar, another option is to have a homescreen widget that displays the countdown. Pretty straightforward process to set up, I'm actually currently using one while I try to figure out how to display it in a scene, as /u/JustRollWithIt mentioned."
tasker,3894pz,creative_name_here_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could definitely do that, but I don't want it taking up a tile on my homescreen when I'm not using the timer."

tasker,3894pz,mcgruntman,2,Sun Jun 7 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"This can be done.   Just need to know what kind of time(s) you're talking about. You just want minutes remaning? Or will it be hours and minutes?   What lengths and units of time do you need to display? Like would you be okay with it incrementing every 5 or 10 minutes, etc.   And related to that - how often does it need to update?    EDIT: Saw below that you didn't want to create a bunch of icons? Because that's what it would entail, but it would be a quick project. If you were to go into an image editor and had to create image icons for 01 to 59, and you created 3 per minute (naming them accordingly), you'd be done in 20 minutes with the whole thing."

tasker,387yxs,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:22:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. I feel sad that nothing more is really done on the UI. I love tasker for the unlimited possibilities it offers but I'm also saddened by the fact that many new users will just ask for a refund a surrender to that steep learning curve.  But even worse for me is the fact that it's not that easy to share tasks between users. It should be extremly easy to download a task and set it up and it's not ! It would be an amazing way to enable new users to observe what tasker can really do. And then dissect task and understand how to do their own.  I would feel it's time to stop adding features and just make Tasker more user friendly and social.  EDIT: I would love a cool site to share tasks and discover over peoples work. A well designed and simple site deeply integrated into tasker. Making any common tasks a few clicks away from being operationnal.

tasker,387h2a,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"You can keep the screen from locking by using Secure Settings to blip the screen on for a few seconds just prior to the time the lock screen kicks in. So if your lock screen kicks in at 30 minutes, set a Profile to run every 29 minutes that uses SS to blip the screen on, but only when you're connected to your car's bluetooth or near it."
tasker,3889g3,vbman213,8,Tue Jun 2 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Need to always back out of the Task using the icon button in the very upper left of the screen. This is 'save' button, though not marked as such.  And use it often, especially if in the middle of working on a long Task, because if you find your phone suddenly doing something else, yes you might lose some changes.  The 'X' button just to the right of center at the top is to 'not save' changes.  Just like any other shitty app - 'save your work often'."
tasker,3889g3,Ratchet_Guy,2,Tue Jun 2 15:54:47 2015 UTC,One thing tasker is very good at is hiding things in pain sight. Although not in a very intuitive way.

tasker,3889g3,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"Similarly, backing completely out of Tasker saves new Tasks and Profiles.  For instance if you create a new task and then go into another task and want to use 'Perform Task' to execute the new task, it won't show up until you have backed completely out of Tasker."
tasker,386scf,Ballin3201,2,Tue Jun 2 06:53:47 2015 UTC,"So you need a few things to make that profile work. You need to have root on your phone and you need Secure Settings downloaded. Then you can use these two profiles:  Profile: WiFi Connected (58) State: Wifi Connected [ SSID:* MAC:* IP:* ] Enter: Airplane Mode Var Set (69) A1: Variable Set [ Name:%AIRPLANE To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ]  A2: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Radios: Cell, Bluetooth, NFC Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]  A3: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Enabled Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]   Exit: Airplane Mode Var Unset (84) A1: Variable Clear [ Name:%AIRPLANE Pattern Matching:Off ]  A2: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Disabled Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]    Then make this:  Profile: Repeat Airplane (78) Time: From 00:00 every 20m Till 23:59 Enter: Airplane Mode Off (83) A1: If [ %AIRPLANE ~ 1 ] A2: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Disabled Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]  A3: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:0 Minutes:1 Hours:0 Days:0 ]  A4: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Enabled Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]  A5: Else  A6: Secure Settings [ Configuration:Airplane Mode Enabled Package:com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin Name:Secure Settings Timeout (Seconds):0 ]  A7: End If   Basically the first profile detects you are connected to WiFi. You can add your ssid into it so this only kicks off when you're at home. It sets a variable and enables Airplane Mode without disabling your WiFi.   The second profile runs all hours and activates every 20 mins. It enables airplane Mode for a minute and shuts off. There is an else statement in case the time value kicks in just when you're leaving your said range.   Hope this helps."
tasker,386scf,blind0wl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:52:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. This is my first time using tasker and I sort of understand parts of this profile but am not 100 percent on how to make these. Is there anywhere where I can learn how to make profiles so I can understand this and actually make them?
tasker,386scf,blind0wl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:54:54 2015 UTC,I'll upload the files so you can install directly into tasker. You can see how is done once imported.
tasker,386scf,blind0wl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:16:38 2015 UTC,OK thanks so much man. So when I download them is that all I have to do or do I have to do anything else with it or with the secure settings app?
tasker,386scf,blind0wl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"So to import the file you open tasker and down the bottom are your project titles or in your case you may just have a home icon.  Long press that home icon and click import (obviously download the file to your mobile) and import it using the menu.  As long as you have Secure Settings installed and your phone is rooted there wont be anything else to do except turn the profiles on.  You should see a new tab with Airplane Mode, click on that and you can go through the items I've made for the profile.  Heres the link: dropbox"
tasker,386scf,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:15:21 2015 UTC,Thanks. The profiles are working great. I was just wondering how to change the amount of time for the profiles from 20 min to something small and also where to put my ssid so it only works at home.
tasker,386k5d,bobloloz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:22:55 2015 UTC,Basically Tasker needs to do this to work. It has to stay awake to be able to perform tasks when you set them to or use your voice commands.

tasker,385bpg,leolgl,3,Mon Jun 1 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"I wanted to give you a proper solution but my phone doesn't have any battery left.  So anyway, here you should try first to find if there is a Google Music ""Activity"" or ""Intent"" that can do this.  I would suggest to use the ""Launch Activity"" task of the Secure Settings plugin for tasker. Or alternatively, you can try findind the correct intent to make Google Music play something. I did something similar for Spotify and it works perfectly. I use typically the launch activity task to open up the Spotify Player no matter on what app my phone is. And I use intent to ask Spotify to ""Search and play"" for an artist or song.  Intents are fantastic but it's usually a bit hard to find the correct way to use them.  There is also the AutoShare app which can do this and a lot more: http://joaoapps.com/autoshare/intents/  EDIT: You can also just get the correct intent in the above page and send it yourself using the ""Send Intent"" basic tasker task. It should do the same."

tasker,380yzy,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm like 99% sure this can be done without making a massive array every time I need to do this, and I'll need to do it often. I've actually almost got it figured out with regex.  edit: ok yeah this works perfectly:  (\n[^\n]*){10}   This would detect 10 or more newlines."
tasker,380yzy,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:16:51 2015 UTC,"Actually that would only detect 10 newlines (although once it reaches 10 no matter how many more it finds, it at least has the 10 so you get return 'true' on the regex match). To detect ten or more you would add the comma:  (\n[^\n]*){10,}   And also, I don't think there's a difference between a Regex return true/false vs Variable Search Replace, since in Search Replace, it uses a Regex and has to go through the same amount of text. The array is a lowercase variable so it only exists while the Task is running, and disappears clearing out of app resources once the Task is finished.  So yes if you want to detect 10 or more, just use Regex to get yes/no. But if you want to know the EXACT number, you'd have to go with Variable Search."

I changed the Values just to check if it works.. change the 8 to 38 and you are fine.. you could do that in the Notify Task but if u ever want to add a task if the condition hits, you have to type that crap again.. so this way u can just simply add stuff.. the if statement and the end if statement is at Task>if or Task>End if  and this is, how the notify Task looks like.. as I said, I don't know what Notify Task you want so I just chose this one.. but as you probably know, you can just switch it to whatever you want.. and yeah.. thats pretty much it..

I'm trying to have a pop-up notification appear and never timeout until I press the screen (I'm currently using the ""Alert>Pop up"" method). Currently, I only see that I can set a time limit, but I want the length it appears to be based on waiting for the user's 'tap,' and not on some arbitrary time. Is there an easy way to do this? I'd like for my screen to stay awake while the task runs (it takes about 90 seconds to complete), and I've found that if the screen goes to sleep midway it can cause issues with the final steps of task firing off properly. I'm not rooted and on Android 5.0.2, but is there a way to get this to happen? I currently have ""Keep Device Awake"" checked in the task properties, but it doesn't seem to do anything. Thoughts?"
tasker,37pnbc,NeedFilmAdvice,3,Fri May 29 17:46:23 2015 UTC,You could add an action to change the display timeout at the beginning of your task and change it back at the end if you want the screen to stay on.

(should say never, right after 599) Removing the popup can be done with the back button. Tapping doesn't seem to close it (although maybe a profile can do this if the back button isn't enough) Keep device awake should keep your device awake, the screen can still turn off while the device is awake. Do you keep having issues with the last steps of the task? I noticed that sometimes tasks don't save properly. What seems to help for me is hitting back until the app closes and then removing tasker from recent apps. Then re-open tasker and check if everything in the task is as you expect."
tasker,37pnbc,Chirimorin,2,Fri May 29 17:59:18 2015 UTC,Any time you make changes to a task you need to back out of tasker using the back button before it is saved and used properly.

The temporary fix is having my context be ""Chrome App open and the time between 0600 to 0900"", Action ""Set Clipboard"".  Simple enough, but I feel like there should be another solution that I am missing. Previously, I had my clipboard set anytime I opened Chrome, this led to overwriting anything that was already on the clipboard."
tasker,37pnbc,Camanokid,2,Mon Jun 1 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, and off the top of my head, thinking if I wanted to do this, and was such a constant activity, and to keep the clipboard un-cluttered (however the clipboard can hold a whole bunch of items typically, when you open it from your keyboard popup you should see a long list of recently clipped/copied items) anyways I would go into Tasker's preferences...  ...and under tab Monitor>General there a checkbox field for ""Notification Action Buttons"". Check it, and you'll see 3 lines appear with magnifying glasses next to them. This is where you can add three Tasks that will appear as buttons in the persistent Tasker notification that stays up in the Notification Bar.  I keep 3 ""often used"" Tasks up there for quick access. Of course you should have the notification icon enabled, and you can choose anything you want for the icon, as the stock one looks way too 'loud' to me sitting up there in the Notiication Tray.  Annnyways - make a Task that simply  has a ""Set Clipboard"" Action to the value of your Access Code. When you get to the place/time you need to enter it, just pull down the notification bar and click the Task Quick Shortcut button you designated in the settings.  You could name your Task ""Clip Code"", give it an icon, and stick it up there. Just hanging around till you need it. Here is a pic of the monitor section of the preferences. So you can see there that the first button that will appear up there is a Task I created to dismiss all kinds of specific notifications I call ""Dismiss Notify"".  Then up in the Notification Bar you can see here that there's 3 buttons (they get crowded if you've got all 3 slots setup, but with just one the name of your Task will show clearly).    Option #2 that I would suggest, and I actually use this to keep quick access to PushBullet when my browser is open - is to create a very small Scene, with a little button, that only shows up when your browser is open. So Profile would have Entry Task that uses Show Scene. With a linked Exit Task of of Hide Scene or Destroy Scene.   To this Profile you could also add your Time Conext, this way little scene only shows up during those hours. Anyways in the Scene just put one little button/icon/image of your choice, with a Tap/Long Tap/Stroke Action to Set Clipboard. Use the Alpha Slider to make it semi-transparent if you'd like.  Like I said I use this to quickly send over links from my browser to my Chromebook, as I come across them for use later on my Chromebook. So I come across 6 random pages while I'm out that I want to view later in greater detail on my Chromebook, I just keep pressing my little 'PushBullet' icon scene. Then later, whenever I happen to get home or be in front of my laptop, all the tabs show up and open automatically."

I created such a profile: Event: Received Text Type: SMS Sender: (blank) Content: *turn out*  I then created a task called ""Automatic GPS"": 1) Variable Set - %aces to %SMSRB (I set a local variable %aces to be the same as the latest message %SMSRB, which is a global variable that updates based on the SMSes I receive) 2) Variable Split - Name %aces Splitter to (i.e I split the stored SMS into two variables, %aces1 and %aces2, separated by the word ""to"") 3) Variable Split - Name %aces2 Splitter for (I further split %aces2 with the word ""for"" to get the incident location; %aces1 was cut off right before the address) 4) Send Intent - Action android.intent.action.VIEW, Data geo:0,0?q=%aces21   I could have changed the Data field in step 4 to google.navigation:q=%aces21 to immediately start turn-by-turn navigation, but I wish to review the location before it actually starts as Google Maps sometimes doesn't recognize the address that is received, such as times where I get sent <highway>/<nearest exit>, otherwise I have to exit turn-by-turn navigation and then edit the address.

tasker,37p6nj,Stevey854,1 point,Sat May 30 06:01:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty inexperienced but this sounds workable. Tasker can definitely read SMS from a set number and regex matching should be able to find the address in it (slightly unsure about this) after that auto input can be used to open your gps map of choice and type in the address (unsure about that last bit aswell)
tasker,37qne7,necrodragon47,2,Fri May 29 16:56:25 2015 UTC,I'm confused by what you're trying to accomplish with this because if I understand you correctly you want every call to come in at full ringer volume but then to set it back after the call has ended.   If you set this up then your ringer volume will be irrelevant because it'll make every call come in loud.   Why not just have your ringer on full constantly?

tasker,37qne7,SupahNoob,1 point,Fri May 29 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Still pretty simple. Setup a profile that dictates for any incoming call, turn the ringer up. Then, in the task, put IF commands for whatever you want to keep vibrate mode on, instead of having the volume turned up.  It's hard to be more specific since you haven't told us when you want the phone to be on vibrate. If it's at work, set a variable %PhoneState to Work Mode whenever your profile for work is activated, and so on. Then it's pretty simple to get it to work like I described above.

tasker,37oy4y,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Fri May 29 07:30:59 2015 UTC,"AutoNotification plugin may be of use in this. What I'm not sure about is if it can 'disable' the default click action of a notification up in the bar, and reroute it, similar to say how AutoInput disables hardware keys for example.  What I DO know, is the AutoNotification can act upon any notification up there, as well as detect when it comes in. So one way to do what you want, is to setup a Profile with AutoNotification Intercept, that looks for whatever notification(s) you want it to trigger on - and link that Profile to a Task that has a AutoNotification Action to CREATE its own notification up there with its own set of buttons, and what types of actions to run on click or dismiss, etc.  And then right after that use AN to dismiss the original Notification.  So in a nutshell:   Notification comes in AN detects it in Profile Launches Task that uses AN>Cancel to dismiss original notification 'Replaces' it by immediately using AN to create its own notification, with tap/dismiss/button actions of its own and can even use the original title/text of the original notification since AN generates dozens of pieces of data from the original notification.   It would take some setting up, but once you did it would work like lightening. By the time you went to look at the default notification it would already be gone and replaced by the custom AutoNotification one.     EDIT: Tested and works. Some interesting possibilities here. There's some notifications I just don't like and wished I could 'replace' them with something more custom, and this had me thinking about and implement the way to do it. Give it a try!  Also in thinking about it, to keep the notification bar fairly clear (it can so cluttered with crap), I might setup AN to intercept and dismiss all notifications EXCEPT certain ones I put on an exception list, and then take whatever data I want from those dismissed notifications and store them in a global var or text file, and setup a notification system where I can pull up the data in a list when I feel like it, sort of a 'notification log'. And then I can clear it once I've read it, etc."

So in the Task that triggers when AutoVoice is activated, get %WIN and store it some other variable name (likely a Global Variable named say %LastWin) before you proceed with doing whatever, and after doing whatever the result of the AutoVoice command is - use AutoLaunch to launch %LastWin, and it should flip you back to Waze or wherever you came from.

Of course, you'd want to watch out for conflicts.

You can use AutoInput to go clicking around inside Tasker itself by checking off the box in the config Advanced>Is Within Tasker or whatever it says, because then it will allow AutoInput to click Tasker's menu's and things, and automatically update the other devices by self-importing that file."

And using PC is probably better idea than phone, as at point I found like every icon pack I could for Tasker and installed them, so I'll definitely have some images to sort through.  Many of the icon packs follow a preset formula of icon types in a certain order, but just just different 'flavors', like Blue Pearl vs. Green Whatevers, etc. they have a formulaic order.  But there's a few that have some really cool icons in them that deviate from this, such as 'Crystal Project' and 'I like Buttons'. I suggest checking these out if you haven't. Some really cool icons for just about anything, and these are ones I really want to use in Zooper.  Of course there's a million free icon sites too, but when you get used to using certain ones in Tasker, it's quick to want to go for those when making an idea.   What I'm really thinking about doing, is instead of having Tasker 'shortcuts' all over my homescreen and in folders, etc. - is to set up a giant full screen Zooper widget, that has how many ever I could possibly fit on there at once lol."

Even things as simple a clock with a functioning seconds hand is a cool animation. Zooper can run a clock but doesn't refresh itself fast enough to have seconds hand.

The only limitations in the free version are you can only have on wall and you cannot import any walls or objects. It is fully functional other than that so you can get a really good feel for it without laying down any cash.    The reason I use tasker for the animations is so that I can set really precise timings for each action. The animations in KLWP are a little limited but frank is working on better control in app.    Here's another animation I made just as a proof of concept:    Portal: https://youtu.be/rJalxei_n7I    There are 2 google plus pages for KLWP one is for questions/bugs/feature requests and the other is a gallery page for people to show their work.

The plugin AutoShare also has lots of options for this, in fact there's a whole page of AutoShare Intents and you can even create your own once you have the Intent figured out.  Intents can also target widgets that exists on any homescreen even if the app if running in the background. More specifically, any widget that runs up in the status bar, say Spotify or whatever, that has any buttons on it to do anything, can now be targeted with the new AutoNotification beta.  Whereas before with regular AutoNotification release it could only target regular style notifications with the standard 'buttons'. Now, if it's in the status bar, whatever it is, and there's something to click - AN can click it in the background, so much so even if the screen is OFF and LOCKED."

You can play around with the extension settings so that it won't launch new browser sessions on computers where you don't have Chrome open, but it will unavoidably launch everywhere you have Chrome open with the same Chrome / extension / user combination set up."
tasker,37h28a,sidc9,3,Wed May 27 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"A slightly more complex option would be to use EventGhost on your PC. It has a Pushbullet plugin. You can send the link to the EventGhost Pushbullet client, and EventGhost can then open the link for you in Chrome."
tasker,37h28a,patel4prez,2,Thu May 28 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I don't think you can push it to only one Chrome session; Not unless you download the PushBullet client for your PC (I think they have Windows, OS X, and Linux clients) and then change the Tasker task to send it to the client instead.   As for whether or not that would open in Chrome, I don't know (It will most likely use whichever desktop browser is set as your default). I only use the Chrome app. Haven't tried the clients yet.  EDIT: Forgot to mention if you change the Tasker task, you may have to recreate the Trigger task; not a hundred percent sure, but if it doesn't work the first time, that'll probably be why :)"
tasker,37h28a,patel4prez,1 point,Wed May 27 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"Second question: In the morning, the only way to stop the noise is to hit ctrl+w to close the tab. Is there a way to send key combos?"
tasker,37h28a,Ratchet_Guy,2,Thu May 28 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"In that case you may want to take a look at Unified Remote (possibly for both tasks, in order to reduce the amount of applications you'd have to run; up to you).  With that you can interface directly with Chrome to open a new tab, close a tab, navigate to a website, etc. using the plugin for Tasker."
tasker,37h28a,Ratchet_Guy,2,Thu May 28 10:43:52 2015 UTC,"AutoRemote plugin is a very good option if you want to distinguish between each individual device, since each is registered with its own unique ID.  Also, as PushBullet seems to assign a unique ID/Name to each device/computer (at least it seems to me, every time I send something a pop-up menu lets you choose ""all devices"" or just a specific device) so you could also use Pushbullet I would think to accomplish addressing as many individual device as you'd like.  The way to do that in Tasker is simply to add an additional Action, one after the other, each containing the Pushbullet plugin Action, each addressing a different device. So say you've got 6 devices, and only want to push to 3 of them, just make 3 Actions in that Task, each addressing a different device."

tasker,37jjpx,nooch14,1 point,Thu May 28 22:05:08 2015 UTC,Ok so I finally got some free time to try this however I am running into some issues.  I created the task just like you listed it however the voice command did not work so I tried just running the task manually but it did nothing.  I tried with Spotify as the app in focus then though that the widget part meant that I needed the widget and to be on my phone's homescreen but that did not change anything.  One thing that may be the issue is that I did not have com.spotify.mobile.android.ui.widget.NEXT or com.spotify.com in my list of options so I had to manually type it in.  2nd issue which may just be a thing with Google Now. Whenever I use it my music will pause so I used Autovoice's continuos listen feature thinking that would fix it but all that did was just pause the music every ~5 seconds.

Click it and the next thing you capture on the screen is recorded by AutoInput. So you'd now press the power on button in your app.  After this go back to the notification and click ACCEPT (it usually pops back up on its own) and it takes you back to Tasker, where it asks you what type of field type you want to use for when AI is going to click this spot in the future. It offers options of text, field id, and the exact x,y point on the screen.  So pick one, and then back out of the config and try your Task. Often times you'll have to try several of those options above (field id etc) that will allow AI to click it propery. I usually resort to x,y point as the last option, since whenever an app updates, or your device, that button placement may change, but if that's all that works, then that's what you go with.  One things to keep in mind, sometimes there's apps that AI simply can't 'see' or integrate with onscreen for some reason. Usually those are few and far between though."

If you were to substitute the image name for whatever words you want to speak to have AutoVoice launch the playlist, you could build that aspect in one Task with like ten actions or less.  Google music doesn't integrate as well with intents, but Media Utilities integrates fairly well with from what I've heard.  As far as waze and Google maps, do a search on here, and someone just mentioned integrating directly with the waze API using Tasker."

tasker,37d40y,Ratchet_Guy,1 point,Tue May 26 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"Hey mate, you're pretty spot on when you say that Tasker's regex matching is pretty basic.  Unfortunately, it doesn't support capturing groups to variables.  Let me clarify: It'll support capturing groups, but it won't send them to variables.  The one important line from the tasker variable search replace manual:   Store Matches In specifies an array variable in which each successive part of the Variable contents which matches the whole Search parameter is stored.   for example, if I was searching the following text:  monkeys like bananas horses eat hay apples and oranges   for   (?:monkeys|horses|elephants)(.+)(?:bananas|oranges|hay|apples)   only lines 1 and 2 would match, and the whole of each of those lines would match. They would each be stored in the variable specified eg. %var as %var(1) and %var(2)  I often wondered if Joao, the developer of the autoapps might make a better regex searcher."
tasker,37d40y,13139269,1 point,Wed May 27 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, and for further clarifying on this. I like the fact that you highlighted the word ""whole"" since that is the key. It will take the entire line. Your example is spot-on and definitely clarifies this.  And...Joao does make a great regex search, at least I know in AutoVoice - you can name any capturing groups into variable names, which are immediately available in subsequent Tasker Actions."
tasker,37d40y,13139269,1 point,Wed May 27 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I meant was if he might make a plugin that offers better regex support than the plain tasker variable search replace.  I regex the daylights out of my voice commands. So handy."
tasker,37d40y,13139269,1 point,Thu May 28 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea for a plugin!   And one that would be pretty simple for him to whip up I'd imagine. If he even just takes the one in AutoVoice and instead of voice input it could just be sent a string and the regex, and send back the full boat of data desired to be captured. That would be cool.  I'll contact him about it."

tasker,37c8ms,stokholm,2,Tue May 26 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"That definitely works, thanks!   For the sake of learning more about intents, do you know why the intent is handled differently depending on how I closed Keep?"

tasker,37do3k,letestaccount,1 point,Wed May 27 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"I would first try replacing ""it"" with whatever ""it"" refers to. I'm sure to you, since you know what you are talking about, ""it"" is obvious, however to someone on the outside trying to figure ""it"" out, ""but it won't connect it automatically"" doesn't make much sense. Same goes for ""My laptop will let me send an audio stream."" This is ambiguous. You can send an audio stream from the laptop, to the laptop, have its permission to send, or ...., see what I'm getting at?  Based on what you've given so far nobody has any idea what device you are trying to what on."
