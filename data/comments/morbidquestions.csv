morbidquestions,3dx0i2,elltim92,6,Mon Jul 20 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"It's a tough question to answer offhand, there's entire bachelor's degrees and I think even a few masters programs about it.   From our Frontline standards, some of the things we look at are light bulbs. They're pressurized and they melt on the side closest to the origin first, it'll literally be an arrow saying ""fire started this way""  Char patterns can tell a lot. Usually the initial ignition point will have a big V of different char on the wall pointing at something that started it. Electrical outlets are common (for both arson and electrical origin jobs) mattresses, a pile of clothes, a stove, a dryer anything flammable really. An indicator of arson would be a char pattern that's equal throughout one whole room, and more conventional throughout the rest of the building. It tells me that an accelerant was probably poured all over that room so the contents lit off about the same time.   Another indicator is ""saddle charring."" Where a liquid accelerant burns, it will drip through the joints in the floor boards and leave little ""saddles"" charred onto the floor joist below the origin.   For the most part we (the firefighters) have no idea what started the fire unless it's painfully obvious. If anything looks off we call in Pennsylvania State Police, (they're the arson investigators in PA, not sure about other states/countries) and we try to make as little further damage to the scene while finishing putting the fire out."
morbidquestions,3dx0i2,Krutonium,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"So really the key to successful arson would come down to deliberately mis-wiring an outlet so it catches fire when something is plugged in, and is destroyed in the process... Interesting, thanks!"

After a solid job, the place is destroyed. We have a ton of these arson indications and ways to say ""this is how the fire was set and progressed here here and here. . ."" Etc. But that still doesn't leave much to point out who the arsonist actually is.   Short of a witness, and confession, it's tough to make any charges stick. You can't exactly say that frank the firebug is an arsonist because he has a gas can. Everyone has a gas can."

Back away from them so that you don't have to helplessly watch your friend be abused, or stay close to the victim so that if they ever do want a way out they'll know they have someone who is there for them and somewhere to run.   Unfortunately, I know from personal experience that there's not much you can do until the victim wants out unless they're abused in a situation where there are witnesses or there is other evidence (such as the abuser threatening them in a written or technological format).  Edited to add: if you go with staying close to the victim then you'll have to acknowledge their stockholm syndrome and make sure that they know you support them but don't say anything bad about the abuser, because the victim will be defensive and at best get mad at you to the point of not confiding in you. At worst, they'll cut all contact and be disgusted at your very existence even after they get away from the abuser."

morbidquestions,3dqzde,Dustcakeboy,30,Sat Jul 18 16:44:34 2015 UTC,The funniest one in hindsight was when the radiator started threatening my in Estonian. I don't speak Estonian but some how I knew what it was.  The creepiest one was the women in blue who crawled out of the toilet to kill me and followed me around my house for about three days. Thankfully she couldn't enter the front room so I holed up in there till she left.  The weirdest one was on morphine after surgery when all the nurses turned into large gorillas in neatly starched uniforms.  Most of my psychotic episode are disassociative  or kapgrass style delusions. Although my most common daydream is jumping up and down on someone whilst I'm wearing ice skates.

morbidquestions,3dqzde,manyshaped,14,Sat Jul 18 23:10:53 2015 UTC,I have the same one every single time my mania gets bad. I get pretty bad hallucinations sometimes too so they lead to pretty terrifying episodes. Ever since I was a kid I've believed that my room/clothes/bags are being tracked by a man that's trying to find me and rape me. When the hallucinations are bad I see the figure of the man in the room/outside the window too so it all becomes really difficult to differentiate if it's actually happening or not.

I become paranoid, certain my family members are persecuting me and eventually it all ends in the same: none of this is real. Everyone, every thing, every moment is in my head and I'm actually locked in a padded room somewhere. Unfortunately, by its nature, any attempts to persuade the thoughts only reinforces them. ""No, this is real, we are real."" Well yeah, that's exactly what an imaginary person would say!   I eventually pass into hysteria and have bursts of intrusive, suicidal thoughts until the cycle is done. It's always worse at night, particularly after long nights of no sleep or waking hallucinations. I also dissociate periodically, like a light switch turning everything off."

Some of these have made me laugh just because I can relate to bizarre and specific these beliefs can get. The fact you're writing them here must mean some of you have a slight awareness to disbelieve them, I'm hoping. Another one for you. One night I believed there was an orange angler fish on my pillow and it told me about an orange monolith that told the ancient secrets of the world. Got put in hospital for that one. The weirdest belief I ever heard about was a story from my retired psychiatrist friend. A patient of hers started digging up filled in pot holes in a road nearby. Her family then hit one of these and were killed in a car crash. Turned out she believed the filled in round holes were where UFOs landed and that the aliens had been making her washing dirty, so she wanted to remove their landing sites. Apparently the aliens were soiling the washing being hung out to dry by the aliens sitting on her line, growing massive erections along the length of the line and then their dicks falling off in little pieces and putting stains on the clothes."

I heard a steady, pulsing beeping sound and for some reason I felt as if I knew it was a monitor in a hospital. I was in a coma as a result of a car crash. In reality, we had swerved just in time to avoid each other but my dream spun it so we had actually colluded and I had been in a coma since, imagining my life as if it had gone on.   And this window into the half asleep half awake is me starting to wake up from my coma and be aware of my hospital setting.  It sounds so bizarre to type, even now, but at the time I was so sure it was true I was filled with doubt about reality.

I also get the delusion that I can create Tulpas and I even start hallucinating, seeing, feeling, and hearing them. It makes it worse that the ones I think are forming are always malevolent. That's less common, though.  The paranoid episodes are always similar and I can fight back the delusions sometimes, but I get rough days and weeks of that shit that causes me to hole myself up in my room and only leave to go to the bathroom (which is right next to my room, so I don't need to go far).

Doing something something dumb that leads to people you love being gruesomely hurt, killed, or disfigured.  For instance if you were driving drunk and caused your daughter to die or be paralyzed Being falsely convicted of some indescribably horrific crime.  For instance, imagine what it must be like to be falsely convicted of raping a child, and have everyone who's ever known you instantly turn on you and hate you, lose all your friends and family, and know that you're headed to prison where you will be he most hated person there, especially if it was a high-profile crime and everyone will know who you are and what you were convicted of. And speaking of prison, I once heard a terrifying story.  There was a prison riot that lasted a pretty long time.  Some of the prisoners went to the protected custody area, which was locked up.  This area housed prisoners who were at a high risk for violence, like former cops, ""snitches"", etc.  The rioting prisoners were like animals, banging on the entry door, slowly breaking it down.  And the protected custody prisoners were trapped, and forced to wait there in horrific terror until the door was burst down and they were tortured and murdered.

A friend and I split an eighth in a couple peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. (One for each of us) After about an hour we began to giggle uncontrollably. Everything was hilarious for a solid twenty minutes then the trip truly begins. Our babysitters were a couple mutual friends who had stocked themselves some 40s and an ounce or two of weed for the night. It's a good idea to have someone in the room not tripping to help calm you down when you do any hallucinogen. Well our babysitters decided er should watch Ferngully while we were all fucked up. My lucidity on shrooms was akin to swimming back to shore while the tide is pulling you back to the sea every so often. I would have these moments of clarity where I knew I was on shrooms then I'd feel the ""tide rise"" again and I'd be swept back out. This involved staring at some object and watching it morph for a good forty five minutes. Things would sort of grow and shrink and move around all wavy. At one point I looked down at my jeans and they appeared to be flowing down my legs. This led me to exclaim to my friends that, ""My pants are like water!"" They all feel over laughing at that one. I had to pee during the trip which meant venturing the halls of the dorms to find the public bathrooms. This adventure was relatively uneventful until I got to the stall and the little yellow smiley face on the poster in the stall floated off the page and across the walls winking at me over and over again. Back to the movie. The beginning was beautiful and seemed to explain life. I made my friends fast forward through all the parts with the smog monster dude because the dark visuals were causing me to freak out.. Towards the end of my trip our babysitters left and my partner on this adventure was still going strong and he was trying to call everyone on his contact list to inform them he was on shrooms and that he was sorry for not being a better friend/brother/son to them. This had me wrestling to take his phone away while explaining to him that he was on shrooms and everything was okay at 3am in the morning.. The mushroom hangover sucks. Your stomach gurgles and the shits are common. The migraine accompanying this is massive and lasts almost the entire next day. Weed was a helpful remedy at this stage. The trip lasts about eight hours. All mushrooms are different strengths and all people are different so you'll find that people's experiences will vary. All in all I had a good time."

There are waves of consciousness where you will randomly realize ""hey I'm on drugs"" and then drift back into your little weird alternate reality. I would advise a trip sitter for the first trip but I never had one after my first time. My friends and I spent a good hour just STARING HARD at our sitter while saying very loudly to each other ""I wish he would just leave"". And then he did. One friend had a bad trip after that and none of us were equipped to handle it which led to me tripping balls driving down the interstate at 5:00 in the morning. Not good.  Overall, it is a great time. I have not experienced a bad trip myself. Sometimes you'll have little epiphanies about life, love, friendship, etc. Other times, you'll just really be amazed by the carpet patterns or nature, man."

morbidquestions,3dq3xs,BoltWire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"It's an incredible experience, but it's also pretty intense. It's nothing like smoking pot and it's probably unlike anything you've ever experienced.  I've only had one shroom experience, but I'm planning to get some more soon. We ground them up in my grinder, sprinkled them on some peanut butter crackers, and waited. About 45min later, you start to feel some effects. You'll get giggly as fuck, everything is so funny. The best way to tell if you've started to trip is to look at some window blinds or the lines on your hands. Things will start to kind of...flow. And melt, and move. It's mesmerizing because of how real it all feels.  We ate a little over an 8th amongst the two of us, so it wasn't a heavy dose, but it was my first time and the last thing you want to do is over do it.  It's also a very introspective drug. If you've got mental health issues (even depression,) in my experience, it can exacerbate these issues. It isn't something to take to get high, just smoke weed if you wanna get high. This is an experience man, and it's easy for it to get dark if you start to get uncomfortable. Everything around me was flowing and waving and flowing for about 7 hours and I started to come down. The come down sucks, too, but I think it might've just been my reaction honestly. 10/10, I can't wait to trip again. I plan to take more next time, but I didn't see any crazy shit/ things turning in to other objects the way it's often portrayed on TV and stuff."

morbidquestions,3dl2fc,Kongo204,5,Fri Jul 17 07:58:16 2015 UTC,"Playing hockey my entire life, you do make some valid points. There are things like breaking out of the zone, offensive/defensive/neutral zone coverage, and formations that do factor in to what we call ""hockey sense"". One of the big differences in male and female hockey is that female hockey does not allow for checking. There is contact; however, you will not be allowed to have any of the big hits or the physical play in women's hockey. This being said, the advantage should have been to the women's team as it is a difficult adjustment from playing contact hockey to making a special exception for one or two games and playing non-contact. The women would be used to forechecking and playing defense without the physical play unlike the high school boys. Watching the majority of players come out of juniors, college, or other highly competitive levels to local ""open"" hockey or adult league and they generally have a difficult time adjusting due to the lack of physical play."

morbidquestions,3dhh7i,random_side_note,5,Thu Jul 16 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"Many people don't understand how orgasms, lubrication, or responses to trauma work. They are physiological responses that are uncontrollable. There is also a misconception that the only responses are fight and flight,  but this is not true at all. In many cases of various forms of trauma, survivors experienced a freeze response. This occurs when it is unconsciously determined that escape is not possible. In order to protect itself, the brain releases chemical inhibitors that basically stop you from reacting. Thinking slows you down, as well as many other normal functions, so they are essentially inhibited. People can experience a temporary paralysis,  dissociation is very common, some people are very sleepy, and can even faint. I've heard it suggested that lubrication occurs during an assault like this as a physiological response to the trauma, as a way to protect the body from injury. (Here's a really interesting article on the neuroscience behind trauma reactions: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ )  As for how survivors feel about experiencing an orgasms,  many people are unaware that it's a response that has nothing to do with ""wanting"" it.

morbidquestions,3dfz1j,ScrewEA,90,Wed Jul 15 23:39:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience on this subject but there was a reddit comment about just this.    Actually this is an obvious question but it's not what you might think. Let me explain it to you, I've been an opiate addict for a long time and tried many drugs. Drugs that are 'uppers' have the most 'obvious' euphoria. For example if you take adderall/coke/meth/speed/MDMA you will get this shining bright euphoria, self confidence, energy, and other drug-specific feelings (for meth like you are king or for MDMA like you love everyone). However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you. After a meth binge, or lots of MDMA use, or staying up all night on coke you will feel like shit. To an extent this aspect is similar to an alcoholic hangover. On the other hand, for many people who experiment with heroin they are underwhelmed (not including IV usage, but most experimenters rarely ever IV first time). They just feel good, chill, happy, but they feel like this spooky drug 'heroin' hasn't delivered. They are just mellow. Oh obviously it has all been a lie they will think. Heroin isn't spooky, it's chill. It's not addictive like everyone else thinks. It doesn't make you do stupid shit or stay up all day and hallucinate like amphetamines or coke. It doesn't empty your serotonin like MDMA or give you a hangover like alcohol. People tend to just think oh, what a nice drug. So the next day they wake up and everything is normal. No headache or shitty feeling--just a slight afterglow of that nice feeling. Oh it was cheap as well! It only cost $10 for a whole night of being high! I thought people said heroin was expensive? And then next weekend comes... There are all these drugs I could do but I liked heroin. It didn't 'fuck me up,' I could still think clearly. No hangover. No feeling like shit later. I still was awake. It just made me happy and content with life. Oh and it's only $10! Well, I should get some more for the whole weekend. This is great! I will use Heroin on the weekends now! Now let's say this person works and has responsibilities. He knows he can't go into work drunk, or on MDMA, or high. So he doesn't. It's actually simple. But heroin... Well the user might actually find they do better work on heroin. Instead of being sad or grumpy or depressed with his job... he is just... happy. Mellow. Content. Everything is fine and the world is beautiful. It's raining, it's dark, I woke up at 5:30AM, I'm commuting in traffic. I would have had a headache, I would have been miserable, I would have wondered how my life took me to this point. This point I'm at right now. But no, no, everything is fine. Life is beautiful. The rain drops are just falling and in each one I see the reflection of every persons life around me. Humanity is beautiful. In this still frame shot of traffic on this crowded bus I just found love and peace. Heroin is a wonder drug. Heroin is better than everything else. Heroin makes me who I wish I was. Heroin makes life worth living. Heroin is better than everything else. Heroin builds up a tolerance fast. Heroin starts to cost more money. I need heroin to feel normal. I don't love anymore. Now I'm sick. I can't afford the heroin that I need. How did $10 used to get me high? Now I need $100. That guy that let me try a few lines the first time doesn't actually deal. Oh I need to find a real dealer? This guy is a felon and carries a gun--he can sell me the drug that lets me find love in the world. No this isn't working, I need to quit. To answer your question, heroin feels nice. That's all, it just feels very nice. You can make the rest up for yourself. Attach your own half-truths to this drug that will show you the world and for a moment you will feel as clever as Faust."

morbidquestions,3dhhfg,bon7bon2000,6,Thu Jul 16 08:48:42 2015 UTC,"That is a tough question. There are lots of reasons children are abused.  In most cases the abuser was abused as a child. Their parents did not have the tools/skills whatever you want to call them to raise them without resorting to abuse. The child grows up being hit instead of learning stress management in child rearing from their parents.   As a result when they have children of their own they resort to the same means their parents used on them. Even though they are cognizant of the trauma inflicted upon them as children they have never learned other methods of discipline or coping. It is easy to sit on a pedestal and say ""You shouldn't hit your kids"" but if all you know about scolding a child is hitting them sometimes sadly that is what happens. Its not like Raising Children 101 is taught in school. This is only one scenario though.  You could also be dealing with mental illness, drug addiction, poverty, genetic or even neurological issues involved. Possibly a mixture of them. People go onto get PhDs studying intra-family violence."
morbidquestions,3dhhfg,ronglangren,5,Thu Jul 16 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like to correct you. Yes the abused can become abusers but it's not as common as you think.

My best friend is an abuse victim and we discuss things like this from time to time. As a victim, she wants to protect her child as much as she can, not in an overbearing way, but in a hypersensitive way. She is always worried about her actions and I have to reassure her that she may have slightly raised her voice to her child, but that is normal parenting.

The overall rate of having been a victim was 35% for perpetrators and 11% for non-perpetrators. Of the 96 females, 43% had been victims but only one was a perpetrator.

morbidquestions,3ddsc5,ridot,6,Wed Jul 15 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"I have a feeding tube, and was 50/50 on the fence as to whether someone would have already mentioned this or not. I guess that answers that!  So to expand on your reply for people who are curious: a stoma is any surgically created pathway between the outside of your body (usually the front of the abdomen) and the inside of a hollow organ. The following organs* can be surgically routed/attached to a patient's abdomen for various reasons: stomach (gastrostomy), duodenum (this procedure was done in the past but is extremely rare now), jejunum (jejunostomy), ileum (ileostomy), colon (colostomy), kidney (nephrostomy), and bladder (cystostomy or appendicovesicostomy). Tracheostomies are a special kind of stoma that connects the trachea with the outside of the neck. You can divide stomas into two major types: ones where the length of the stoma is formed by a hollow/tubelike organ itself vs. ones where the stoma is formed by cutting holes in both the outside skin and the skin of the internal organ, and stitching the edges of these together. The former kind will stay open on its own, whereas stomas of the latter type need to have some type of device in the stoma tract to keep it from closing up, much like a body piercing might. Even well-established and healed stomas can become too small and require surgery to re-establish after just a few hours of the medical device being out of place. These include stomas for trachs, feeding tubes, drainage tubes, suprapubic catheters, and things of that nature.   Trying to have penetrative sex with someone's stoma is a bad idea, then, because for many stomas you run the risk of letting the stoma close up (presuming that it shrinks rapidly and penetration is never achieved). If a person disregards pain or doesn't feel pain for some reason, such as spinal cord injury, of course it's possible to force something of larger diameter into the stoma; the skin at a surgical stoma is not stretchy and presumably there will be tearing if anything of sizable diameter is forced into the stoma.   Sadly, the majority of cases of ""stoma sex"" show up in the hospital as elderly and/or developmentally disabled people who are living in institutional settings and have been sexually abused by a caregiver. It is obvious that someone has raped them in the stoma because when the infection at the stoma site is cultured, it is found to be a sexually transmitted infection.   Less common, but not entirely nonexistent, are healthy and consenting adults who just happen to have this as a fetish/kink. It's important to understand that stomas are surgically created due to special medical needs and that engaging in sexual behaviors involving the stoma can pose serious health risks not just from infection but from functional damage to the involved organs.   TL;DR—If your doctor sews your pooper to your tummy, don't let someone put their dick in it."

He said that he asks this of all the transgender people he treats and has a theory that gender dysphoria is on the autistic spectrum. I have never met a trans woman with autism but plenty of trans men, which could go hand in hand with the autistic idea of having an extreme male brain. I find it really fascinating.  As for social justice warrior stuff, I can't stand that kind of thing. I think the link between transgender people and SJWs are that they may have been persecuted by gender at some point and are angry about it. For instance, when I was female I would be treated very differently from my male identity now, it's interesting and an experience of both sides, so I class myself as feminist, but not to the bitter SJW extreme."

Maybe I could be happier, my mother too! I never went to his wake. He was adopted and never knew who his maternal parents were -- the ones who had raised an alcoholic son both had passed, too. My mother did go to his wake and funeral...she did love the man at some point in time. She said she was one of the only people there.   Sometimes I feel like I should visit his unmarked grave somewhere in a Jewish cemetery..maybe think about what could have been. He gave us nothing of worth.

I was maybe twelve or thirteen when this happened, so the grooming process took a while, but it was still terrifying. I accepted his gifts and I thought nothing of it. He was just a sweet old guy with puppies and chocolate bars."

She had Huntington's disease (she passed away last November). In case you haven't heard of it, it's a neurological degenerative disease.. I like to describe it as the evil spawn love child between alzheimer's and Parkinsons. The affected end up completely losing control of their body and mind. There is no cure and no real treatments. huntingtons disease is genetic and autosomal dominant, meaning any offspring of someone with Huntington's Disease will have a 50% chance of developing this disease.  My mother knew she was at risk before she had kids. She was severely depressed, and when she started talking about being a mother (she was sure a baybeeee would completely cure her depression), many of her friends and family members sat her down and told her that they think she might have the disease and she should refrain from having children until she's tested. Well, her selfish narcissism took control, and she decided to have three kids before being tested. It took her only 7 years before she gave up on parenting and decided to drink the rest of her life away. My dad had divorced her and the courts automatically gave her custody. Me being the oldest, at 6 years old I was forced to help my elderly grandmother raise my siblings.   Not only was I cheated out of a childhood, not only was I cheated out of a loving parent, but now, at age 24, I am showing signs of the same disease that killed her. If I do test positive, it is very likely I wont live another 15 years. I will be lucky if 5 of those years are ""good"" years, ie. I don't lose my driving priviledges, I am able to continue working, I am able to live independently, etc.   Fuck that woman and her fucking selfish delusions of motherhood. Fuck her for not listening to literally every single other person in her life who told her to wait on having kids. Fuck her for passing the fucking job on to me. Fuck her for playing with THREE FUCKING LIVES as if my siblings and I aren't people who will probably suffer the same agonizing death! I am not a religious woman, but I wish hell and eternal suffering on her. I'm 24 years old and I'm having to plan the end of my fucking life. My 17 year old sister has attempted suicide because of the situation we were forced into. she got off Scott free. She got to sit there in her drunken haze and ignore the suffering she forced on her children. Fuck her and fuck huntingtons disease."

When I was in grade school she told me I was fat and disgusting and that lead to anorexia/bulimia for several years (it still is relevant in my life, about 6 years later), she then would grab at my bones and tell me I'm disgusting and look terrible. She would tell me she only had two kids she loved (there's 3 of us). I gained a ton of weight to please her only to be shot down again into the same cycle. I've suffered severe depression and anxiety since high school. One day I broke down in front of her and admitted that I wanted more than anything to kill myself.  She told me that I was an idiot that deserved to go to hell. Later when she discovered I cut myself she told me I'm an idiot.... basically she has made it her life's work to mentally tear me down.

She died in December. I mourned more than I expected to, but to be honest, I mourned more because of what I should have had from my mother (protection) than because of what I had actually lost (not much).

morbidquestions,3d6y10,shiteater101,3,Tue Jul 14 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of videos of people dying and have read a lot on this subject. From what I understand, if you are going to kill yourself the quickest, easiest and most painless way to do it is with a shotgun blast to the head; That being said, if you screw up and don't shoot yourself square-on, you will be in a world of pain. It is almost always fatal, which is (I suppose) desirable if you are trying to kill yourself.  One problem with ODing on drugs is that a lot of the time it is not fatal. It is also (generally speaking) horribly painful. You have poisoned your body, and your body will react accordingly. This often results in spasms, seizures, and vomiting.  What you say about a numbing drug and cutting your wrists probably wouldn't be too bad, but it wouldn't be as quick as a shotgun blast or a detonation of some serious explosives. I guess as I'm sitting here thinking about the best way to commit suicide, it would involve some sort of drug (either for pain and/or anxiety) and then something quick, however I am also taking into account that most people wouldn't have the means to end their life in such a way.  tl;dr As far as conventional methods of suicide, shotgun blast to the head ranks as the quickest, easiest, most painless and most effective."
morbidquestions,3d6y10,shiteater101,3,Tue Jul 14 06:27:42 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally a shotgun blast to the head never crossed my mind. I have thought of using a handgun, but imagine flinching just as you pull the trigger and missing that clean shot through. x.x  At least there is no  chance of that with a shotgun the force of bullets impact definitely would go through at the very least it would blow your skull and brains out. The only thing is would you really not feel that even with drugs administered, I can't imagine being numb enough to take bullets in the body and not feel it. Although, I guess it wouldn't matter sinxe it would be a split second."
morbidquestions,3d6y10,MozArc,3,Tue Jul 14 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"The mistake a lot of people make with the shotgun is that they hold it under their chin pointed upwards towards the ceiling. When they pull the trigger it is not hard to pull the gun back too far as well. When this happens, the face is blown off and death is no longer guaranteed, and even if it is, it can be a long ordeal. So I think the best way to do it would be to point the shotgun right between the eyes, parallel to the ground and somehow fire it that way.   By the way, I know that this is /r/morbidquestions, but I would still feel remiss if I didn't say anything; I hope you are not considering this and are just 'morbidly curious'.

morbidquestions,3d6l8p,danthemango,20,Tue Jul 14 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"A woman can be sure that her offspring are hers, because they come out of her body.  So she knows that the effort she puts into raising the children is useful-- they are propagating her own genes.  A man can't be sure his mate's children are his.  He can only guess based on physical resemblance and his trust in his mate's monogamy.  If he is going to put effort into raising her children, he wants to be sure they are his own offspring.  Treating women as property is one way men feel more confident about their obedience and monogamy.  But that is only one cultural strategy.  An alternative is to spread out the responsibilities of raising the children-- through the extended family or other social group-- so nobody has to worry as much about whose is whose."

morbidquestions,3d6l8p,SquidsStoleMyFace,9,Wed Jul 15 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"what do you believe is the core foundation of the contempt regarding female promiscuity among men, irregardless of their religious affiliations or culture?    It is simply one of the ways in which this old thought of women inferiority is still displayed. Not too long ago, people thought women didn't even have souls. It's a men's world, because of how society has evolved over the years.     Why does the thought of your girlfriends/wifes sexual past frighten you so much?     Personally, it doesn't. I've been with one girl before my current gf, and she's been with several guys, and several girls. I don't give a fuck because she loves me and I love her, she likes the way I do her and even if she went and did it with a different person I'm sure it'd be something purely physical and I also wouldn't mind a whole lot. As a result, I think when people are bothered by this, it's because they are insecure. Their lack of confidence makes them compare themselves to someone who they don't even know. What if they fucked her better? What if my penis is smaller and one day they crave their previous' mates'? Things of that sort.      Also, regarding your English and not the thread: Irregardless is not a word, it's just regardless (Meaning with no regard towards [subject]). This is in my opinion the worst mistake. You should have written man's, not mans, and woman's. possess, not posses. Resembling male genitalia too much, not A male genitalia, I can't explain this one, it's just odd to me. This unfortunate fear existS, not exist. Other than these, your English is very good. I just pointed them out so you can keep growing and not to be condescending."

morbidquestions,3d6l8p,as_above_so_below,-4,Tue Jul 14 08:26:42 2015 UTC,THATS WHY U BEAT EM!
morbidquestions,3d6l8p,readyforhappines,5,Tue Jul 14 09:11:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only real explanation there can be is genetics and survival of the fittest. Each indivual wants to pass on his/her genes. This ensures survival.   Creatures of all kinds will go to very vast lengths to reproduce as much as possible to ensure its genes are passed down. Another male sleeping with your partner means has genes are being passed down and not yours.   We see other men as survival competitors. Men of almost all species deposit their seed in several females in attempt to produce as much offspring as possible. This ensures his genes will be passed on to the coming generations. Women can only have one set of offspring at a time, but men can have several different partners with a ton of offspring.   This is why men have a history of being more promiscuous, and it is seen as helpful for him to have as many mates/kids as he can.  Now, with that being said. There are males/females in the animal kingdom that will help raise other families children. (Say a brother or uncle will help raise the offspring of certain parents.) It is called Hamilton's rule. The equation is rB-C > 0. R stands for the coefficient of relatedness (how many genes two individuals share). B is the benefit (how many offspring an individual is helping to raise. C is cost (usually set at 1, this signifies what an individual is giving up to help raise other's offspring). This equation is used to determine if staying to raise another's offspring is beneficial to your genetic survival. You can look up examples of this equation being used.  So it is not uncommon for an individual to sacrifice his/her own chance at reproduction to help his/her genes being passed on through relatives.   It all boils down to genetic survival.  Edit: on mobile. Sorry for terrible formatting and grammar."

morbidquestions,3d6l8p,Kubrick_Fan,3,Tue Jul 14 14:24:07 2015 UTC,Your use of English is fine.
morbidquestions,3d6l8p,wiseIdiot,2,Tue Jul 14 07:46:59 2015 UTC,"(English is my second language too.)  I believe the reason is different. A man can procreate all year long but a woman has to wait at least an year between pregnancies. So, to achieve reproductive success, men and women have to adopt entirely opposite strategies. For a man being promiscuous ensures the maximum number of offspring thus increasing the probability that his genes outlive him. That being the case a woman gets to be picky about who she sleeps with and it makes sense that she chooses only the best males so that her offspring inherits his ""good"" genes (as compared to the ""inferior"" genes of the other men who are not as successful). Now this situation lead to the view that a promiscuous woman is one who is unable to attract a good man and/or that she is more likely to give birth to children with ""inferior"" genes because of her lack of discrimination in choosing mates. I guess millions of years of evolution had this way of thinking programmed into our brains and that is why we see female promiscuity with contempt while we almost encourage men to be promiscuous. I believe that this is completely unfair (I am a guy), since modern technology has made it possible for a woman to sleep with whomever she wants, without having to worry about giving birth to a child she does not want. Nature has given equal desires to both men and women so we should be able to see female promiscuity and male promiscuity in the same way."

Dude had the worst luck (socially and in general), and came from what one would call an ""eccentric"" family who just didn't seem to click with anyone (the problem seems to have been inter-generational, even his parents were considered oddballs by their peers). Thing is I don't think there was anything ""wrong"" with him, he was just awkward as all hell and, possibly in an attempt at fixing his shortcomings and trying to fit in, often made things worse. To add to his social shortcomings the dude had braces, acne, freckles and was almost a ginger (more like a weird brown). It was basically guaranteed that he was going to have a hard time as a kid...   Hell, i once remember him being laughed off the stage at a talent contest held by a local church. I'm talking about fully grown adults who are TRYING to entice children into becoming good little Christians who literally pointed and laughed at his otherwise deathly serious routine.   Perhaps justifiably and despite his misfortune, the dude had a weird temper. I for one had always suspected that if someone was going to be found with a collection of human skin masks, it would be him. After all, I could think of a dozen people who would be on my list if I were him.  Anyway, it's years later and an old school bud and I are at a dinner party regaling our girlfriends with tales of high school and this guy comes up. Since we've both moved to a new city we haven't kept up to speed on local affairs so we turn to Google/Facebook for news of the killing that surely must have taken place/the discovery of an expansive dungeon filled with bullies at an unassuming home.  Surprisingly enough all we could find was a reference to him being a youth pastor/counselor at a local church. Guess things finally worked out for him in the end.

When he came back, he openly admitted that he'd been in jail, detained on suspicion of murder, because his girlfriend ""died"" and was last seen alive entering his house.   What I found out through the grapevine, and later on the news, is that when he said she died, she was actually stabbed 42 times with three different knives. They found her body around 11 the next morning, less than 12 hours after she walked into his house. Where her car still was.   For the life of me, I don't know how they couldn't get anything to stick to him, but he's still walking free, and the murder went unsolved.

When it's over you go in another room with a bunch of other girls/women for a half an hour until they are sure you are OK to go home. That part was almost the strangest because some of them were crying, some were sleeping, some were just staring off into space.  Nobody was talking. I was by myself both times so when they said I could go I just took the bus. I'm glad I didn't have to run the gamut of protesters.  That wasn't really a thing then.   Afterwards I just had a couple of hot toddys and read Gone With The Wind."
morbidquestions,3d1y4f,dontgotomarz,6,Mon Jul 13 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"I have had 2. The first was at 10 weeks. It was at planned parenthood. I wasn't supposed to knock out but whatever they gave me did. I woke up crying hysterically. The aftermath was horrible because I went back to work the next day and spent too much time on my feet and ended up with blood clots and had to have a D&C.   Second time I was unaware I was pregnant because I had been nursing my daughter and didn't have a period. Turns out I was 16 weeks. There was no way I could have another baby, I had just been laid off. I elected to terminate and it was a long process. I went in and they put something in my cervix to soften and dilate it and I had to wait 24 hrs for the actual surgery. This caused serious cramping for the day and I felt the baby move that night. I went through with it and have regretted it ever since. This time they put me under and I woke up in my own recovery room. The after was far easier on me than the first time."

morbidquestions,3d1y4f,Poodlepied,2,Mon Jul 13 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"I have had 2.  The first one was a pregnancy termination, the other was a miscarriage (which is still termed 'abortion') of a planned pregnancy.  Both times I had a D & C (Dilation and Curette) under General Anaesthetic.  For both I was given a pill which essentially brings on labour and there is no turning back from there.  Cramps start immediately and within 1 hour you are in surgery prepping for the D & C.  You are completely sedated so I have no idea what the procedure itself was like.  For #1 I was given no pain relief.  For #2 I was given Oxycodone which was quite lovely.  Bleeding and cramping for a couple of days afterward which was quite painful. Bleeding for a week or so afterward.  It wasn't a particularly painful physical procedure.  Mentally it was worse to get over."

The cramps felt like 100x worse than any period cramps ive ever had and I was literally screaming in the car on the way back. This pain went on for 4 hours before this unbelievable relief when I finally passed the clots. BUT due to my antidepressants I couldn't take ibuprofen (which apparently helps more than paracetamol during a medical abortion) so that's why the pain was so bad"
morbidquestions,3d1y4f,rosabecalm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:35:00 2015 UTC,"Physically it feels a like cramps but much more intense. Also I suppose It depends on the method used to cause It. I'm told that if you are past 3 months, I think, the procedure is brutal and incredibly painful. I guess It depends a lot on specific circumstances.   Emotionally it's worse, at least I thought so. I can't speak for everyone but I was bitter, sad, angry, it was like all the nasty emotions combined into a super tornado and ripped my inner world to pieces. Again I guess this also has to do with the circumstances you're in at the time.   Tl\dr- depends"
morbidquestions,3d1y4f,FieryAriess44,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"Despite being pro-choice without any limits my entire life, it was excruciatingly painful both physically & mentally. I found out around 12 weeks that there was something wrong & she would not be able to survive, heart not forming properly. They said her heart would stop any day but it didn't.   By 18 weeks, I was approaching the point of having to have an intentional stillbirth so I decided to terminate immediately. Didn't think I could mentally handle labor when I knew my baby was dead.  The day before, they had to insert some kind of medicated sticks into my cervix to begin dilation. It was excruciatingly painful & they refused to give me anything for the pain. I spent the next 24 hours in unbelievable agony. But the worst part was the doctor I saw that day (rude, dismissive, not at all informative or comforting).  I'm not prone to dramatics nor am I an especially religious person, but this women actually gave off an ""evil"" vibe, there's no other way to explain it. That's a whole other post though.  The doc who actually did the abortion was very kind & professional, as was his whole team. They even managed to make me laugh a few times during OR prep & even moved me up on the OR schedule when I began to get anxious & start crying. After all, this was the hospital I should have been visiting to give birth, not to end my pregnancy.   The next few days were physically very difficult. Mentally & emotionally I was a 100% mess for the next few months actually, until I got pregnant again.   All in all, the experience could not have been more seamless: Decision was wholly mine but completely supported by my pro-choice husband, parents, siblings & close friends. It was done close to home within a matter of days, 100% covered by my insurance & genetic testing confirmed that this was a complete anomaly, not inherited (meaning no concern of problems with future pregnancies & I have a healthy beautiful son now).   I gave permission for her tissue to be used in a study the hospital was doing for Parkinsons, so we found some comfort in the fact that our misfortune could have a positive impact on others.  Most importantly, within 6 weeks I was pregnant with my son & he's the greatest thing in my life. I have no regrets about losing the first baby because I didn't know her but I can't imagine my life without him. I was already through my first trimester with him by what would have been her due date.  It's wonderful that women have the choice but the way the pro-choice crowd (myself & hubby included until we experienced it for ourselves) act like it's no big deal & just a simple procedure is complete bullshit. It's a heavy, life-changing decision with ramifications beyond anything we expected.   That does not in any way make abortion wrong or bad, it just means that you need to be fully informed. The segment of our society that supports it has also way oversimplified the situation & I fear that makes women unprepared for dealing with it.  TLDR: It could not have been easier to get an abortion on demand but it was still something that traumatized me (and my husband) a great deal. I was a real mess & it scared the hell out of both of us. It's a huge deal & you need a whole lot of support & comfort to get through it. Still completely pro-choice but it did change how I feel about minors getting abortions without parental consent, if anyone cares."

morbidquestions,3d2jrk,LFD1988,6,Mon Jul 13 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"Doctors were performing lobotomies to cure patients of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, but sometimes even things like depression too. The results really just depended on how experienced the doctor performing the surgery was and what the patient was going to be lobotomized for.  There was a case involving a woman who was suicidal, however, after getting the lobotomy, she claimed to be feeling much better and lived a normal life.  John F. Kennedy's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, went through the procedure because she was acting rebellious and was constantly moody. After the procedure, she was left with the mental capacity of an infant.  It really just depends on several factors, such as the experience of the doctors who performed the lobotomy or what the person was seeking the lobotomy for. During the 1930's-1950's when the 'lobotomy craze' was at its peak, the doctors didn't have nearly as much caution when performing the surgery. Dr. Walter Freeman (one of the most well-known doctors in the United States that would be willing to lobotomize patients) would essentially do it for anyone with a number of different illnesses or issues they had. He had lobotomized a woman three times, until she had died during surgery. (He was banned from performing surgery after this incident)  TLDR; Mostly depends on the person. However, the majority seemed to be more damaged after the surgery, to include losing all mental capacity, experiencing a limited learning ability, or even claiming to feel ""different""."

When I cut, I focus on that pain, instead of all of the negative thoughts and feelings. When I see the blood, I can take a deep breath again. My thoughts quiet down, and I feel almost normal.

Personally, it was a combination of a release but also a sense of control. I was battling an eating disorder with the help of my family and doctors. It felt like everything was out of control and I had no real say on anything, as I couldn't eat what I wanted or go out when I wanted to (I was around 13 when I started treatment). I used to cut my hips and thighs when I was having a shower. It just felt good to have this big secret that nobody else knew about and could interfere with or try to control. When I was stressed and angry or upset about other things in life I could take out those emotions on my body without having to deal with the consequences, or at least this was my mindset at the time.  In regards to your friend, has she (I'm assumed they're female but forgive me if not) been going through a particularly rough patch elsewhere in her life? Like problems at home or school/work difficulties? I believe the best thing that you can do at this time is to show your friend your complete support, that you're not judging her and that you definitely don't think she's doing it for attention (don't explicitly say this, just don't say you think she IS doing it for attention). Try and find out when she last cut and talk about the things that happened before that that which made her feel that way, and then talk about how you can work together to make sure she avoids those situations again. Remember it's habitual and addictive, so she probably won't be able to just 'give up'. This is a big issue to handle and a burden on you, especially if you are the only one who knows. Presuming you are at school, try and talk to a guidance councillor or trustworthy teacher about the situation, but bear in mind that they will contact her parents if they feel she is a danger to herself.

One specifically, Misoprostol, is also used in conjunction with Mifepristone or Methotrexate to induce labor and cause a miscarriage. It's relatively inexpensive and available in places abortion is legal.  If you want the nitty gritty, women have also done everything from strenuous weight lifting to throwing themselves down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage.  Even more dangerously, coat hangers (or something similar) were also used to slide through the cervix and into the uterus, where they stabbed at the fetus to rip it to bits, then slid the hanger back out. This is extremely dangerous, because coat hangers are sharp and you can very easily tear part of your cervix, uterus, the top if your vagina, or even stab through to the bowels or bladder.   Even without all that, you're asking for infection sticking a sharp object in your delicate nethers. A coat hanger is not sterile at all, and you can't make it sterile. Well, unless you have an autoclave.

morbidquestions,3d1zah,Spearminte,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"You actually don't know. That's why it's dangerous; you can stab into organs by accident, because you have almost no control over the hanger itself. And you wouldn't immediately have bits coming out immediately, as far as I'm aware. Your uterus has to contract to squeeze them out. (Which is why we cramp on our period, too).   You might get some blood, but chunks of tissue aren't coming out unless you have a really big internal and external os (the internal is a hole that connects the cervix to the uterus, the external is the one leading into the vagina). And that blood that does come out could be caused by the sharp coat hanger tearing the external os or the canal leading into the uterus. There is absolutely no way to do this safely, which is why it's so horrible."

My great grandfather was supposed to pass months before he actually did. All of my family was gathered in his house while he was sleeping. Suddenly he wakes up out of nowhere (he was on plenty of morphine and should've slept through the next couple days) to my great grandma by his side, sits up as much as he can and kisses her. Everyone came running into the room, he looked at all the people that loved him smiled and went back to sleep. He passed later that night.   My uncle recently passed and by our last interaction together, he knew that was the last time he was going to see me. I went with my Aunt (his wife) to their daughters baseball game which was odd because 1) I hate baseball and 2) I should've been out of town but had to reschedule. My cousin was deadset on going back to her house before the game for whatever reason even though her mother told her no many times. We end up going to their house and I get down with them. My uncle was a bad alcoholic and was usually passed out in his room. Well this time he was wide awake on the living room couch. I got very excited and started talking with him. My aunt is ready to leave so I have to say bye. I gave him a hug and told him I loved him and turn to leave but he stopped me, stood up, wrapped his arms around me again even tighter, and told me that he loved me. I was in shock because the man didn't even like to shake hands. He kissed me cheek and told me to tell my mom and siblings that he loved them as well. Two weeks later he died in his sleep.   I'm sorry for the wall of text but the human mind and subconscious are a very powerful thing. The person knows when their time is up, be it some 6th sense or gut instinct.   TLDR; gramps broke a morphine coma for one last kiss and Uncle shows last bit of affection before passing. The person close to death knows when their time is up. If the universe put you infront of someone you know is sick, tell them you love them."

morbidquestions,3d25l3,saucecode,3,Sun Jul 12 23:41:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on the freezer, the condition of the body, etc.  Assuming the freezer is at the correct temperature and the body is fresh when it is stored, most likely indefinitely, or until the freezer gets old and craps out. A human body is nothing more than well-organized meat, after all, and the carcasses of animals, both butchered and whole, can be frozen for years and remain in their original state. Hell, freezing is a common method of storing animals prior to taxidermy - I've heard stories of pheasants, frozen in blocks of water, being stored for nearly 20 years before being thawed and taxidermied.  But it would take a considerable amount of time for a whole body to freeze for the first time, even in a powerful freezer at it's lowest temperature. For best results, it should be dismembered beforehand, as individual pieces would freeze much, much quicker than a whole body. At the very least, evisceration would speed up the process significantly, even if the limbs and head were left intact."

Not to say women always feel a bond with their children, there can be a depression after the hormone shit storm even 7 months later that can make a woman want to kill their child.      Being a child of a narcissistic mother, I am finally coming to terms with the fact that she never loved me because she is incapable. It is hard to remember she doesn't love me, and I find myself trying to have a relationship with her, like I will tell her something personal. Later I remember that I slipped up letting her in, because she will use a ""secret"" against me, by telling someone about it or just making fun of me to push me down."

The book leaves it up to the reader to decide if Kevin's mother didn't love him because he was a sociopath, or if Kevin was a sociopath because his mother didn't love him.  There are a lot of passages where the author describes what it is like to have a child you don't like."

He was obviously heartbroken, like any person in his situation would be. We took time to mourn, he got a prescription from his doctor to work 50% (with full pay) and then gradually work more when he felt he was able to do so. That way he was able to take care of my sister and I through the worst period. He had also lost his mother when he was young, so he sort of knew how it would be for us. It's really tough, especially the first period, and then it gradually gets easier. At the beginning it's an intense despair and you feel empty inside. Then that despair gradually develops into sorrow, and after a while you're able to get through the day without crying. One always misses the person one has lost, that never goes away, but the emptiness and pain gradually diminishes. Best of luck!"

morbidquestions,3cyol0,Inaner,128,Sat Jul 11 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Gonna use my throwaway for this. English isn't my first language and though I speak/type it really well when I write longer it turns more and more into a rant.  That sadness and depression has anything to do with eachother is a misconception. Sadness is an emotion and depression is the lack of it. Depression is hard to describe, it is nothing and this nothingness starts to take over your mind.  Turning the things you like into nothing. Playing videogames or watching movies turns into sitting in front of the computer, food doesn't taste like anything it's just chewing a texture, music is just noise, smiles is forcing each side  of your mouth up. I can go on and on, laughing, excitement, it's just not there anymore. It's gone.  But the nothingness doesn't take over the bad things. Insecurities, anger, jealousy, suicidal thoughts. Instead they get ""highlighted"" for the lack of a better word. Your brain goes ""You're human, feel something!"" and grabs a hold of the  emotions that are left. It grabs the insecurities and you tell yourself how pathetic and useless you are and how you bother and annoy anyone you try to talk to and since your self-esteem has turned into nothing, you agree with yourself.  You see a happy couple or a group of friends or someone getting a promotion but your brain doesn't go ""Oh, I'm so happy for them"" it gets jealous. Why does that guy have a girlfriend? Why does he get invited? Why does he get a ""thank  you""? And don't even get me started at angry, you get angry all the time and at everyone. Your now non existent friends, internet strangers, the people you love, that fucking screeching bird but most of all yourself, for that life you  lived or that mistake you made that got you into this shit to begin with. And you think to yourself everyday, why didn't the depression take the bad things away too? But if it did you would have nothing left. At that point you wouldn't  even be human anymore. So you might aswell just fucking kill yourself.  That's why we get so angry when people tell us to ""look at the positives"" because there are no positives. We're not angry at them they are just trying to be nice, we are angry at ourselves for not being able to ""just cheer up""."
morbidquestions,3cyol0,myusernamethrowaway,24,Sun Jul 12 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"This is accurate.  For me, I can feel depression the greatest when first entering it. That's when the contrast between the depressed world and the normal world is at its greatest. Basically, depression begins where sadness ends. When you're too hurt/sad/angry for too long, something strange happens. You expect to get even sadder and even angrier. But you don't. You just fall out through the other side. At first, it's disorienting. Why am I not feeling anything? What happened to the sadness? The brain has started to pack up, take its ball, and go home. And in those first few days of depression -- for me at least -- you start to feel a little superhuman, a little impervious to consequences. You begin to take risks. Drive a little faster on the parkway, because you no longer care if you crash. If you can drop far enough down the well, there's this eerie sense that life has become a video game, and if you die, well, you won't really die.   Then, the motivation goes. And when that happens, every little thing becomes effort. Getting out of bed is effort. Cooking a meal. Brushing your goddamn teeth is effort. I wouldn't wish it on anyone."

And then something happens, you get divorced or a child dies or what have you, and your brain says ""you know what would be great? Why don't we turn this up to 11?"" Suddenly it's like entering depression all over again, but everything shuts off, the good, the bad, just...you become a shell.

The obvious first is that until you have experienced depression it will just be a description. There are some good descriptions, and if you really think you might get the idea. It is closely related (intertwined) w avolition and anhedonia. There just isn't ANY reason to . . . The second is a problem w words. The term ""depression"" is just plain wrong. Everybody gets ""depressed"" (in the common sense) occasionally. But it ain't the same at all. I think a new word would maybe help others at least understand the subtleties of the problem and why depressives act the way they do. I don't blame people for not understanding, but it would be nice if they admitted it's not ""depression"" as they understand it. It's a little like suicide. No one wants to die, but to the depressive there's no reason not to die. Why not? Nothing will change except you will no longer have the vague annoyance you're missing out on life. A depressive isn't lazy. There is NO reason to get up. NO reason to do something. NO satisfaction. NO reward. NO feeling of accomplishment. NO feeling of failure. NO ambition. NO enthusiasm. NO idea now to solve the problem. NO (frequently) skill to go out and force themselves to be sociable. I would use the word blah except it's too blah for ""depression"".

I'm in a depressive episode right now brought on by losing my job and no matter how much I logically know that I'll get something else and that I really couldn't have prevented it, I'm constantly telling myself that I'm the biggest fuckup on earth and I'll never get another job and that I'm totally worthless and nothing will ever be okay again.  Sometimes when I've been alone and unoccupied for too long, my brain kicks into suicidal ideation mode. It's as simple as ""It would be easier. You'd just go away. Jerk the steering wheel right now, it's that easy and then you're gone."" I wouldn't kill myself, I love my family and surrounding support too much and realize the pain it would cause them, but my brain points out how simple it would be and how it's the only SURE way to make it stop firing on that level.

morbidquestions,3cyol0,The_Highlife,2,Sun Jul 12 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"If you will suspend disbelief for the sake of this narrative, allow me to try and illustrate:  You slowly become allergic to all foods except oatmeal. Plain ol' oatmeal, all day, everyday, for years. You have oatmeal for so long that you forget what other food even tastes like. Eventually that just becomes your status quo. People ask you why you don't just try eating other foods again, not understanding that you literally could not eat other foods with dying. To them, its a choice. To you, there is no choice, and the constant barrage of their pestering becomes annoying. ""Why don't you just stop eating oatmeal and start eating something else?"" is as realistic as ""Why don't you just stop breathing air and start breathing water?"" You wonder what its like to have choices of food, and you long for that opportunity, but it just isn't possible. It doesn't exist for you. So then you grow resentful of everyone else, and begin to hate the fact that you have no such choice to make. You remember when you used to be able to choose your foods, and now it feels like you're just wasting time and air because eating- once an activity that brought some pleasure, and is a necessity for day-to-day living- is now a chore, and there are some days when you'd just rather not eat at all.  Then one day, a small dollop of brown sugar winds up in your oatmeal just as you take a bite...and you don't die. For the first time in years, you tasted something else. That small dollop was a flavor you forgot long ago, but even that small dollop packs more flavor than you could have ever imagined. That tiny dollop is more flavorful now than all the brown sugar in the world ever was before. The sensation of simply tasting something again overwhelms you, and you break down crying- you're happy that you have been able to taste again, but saddened by all the flavors you've missed out on over the year. It's overpowering and every taste bud is hypersensitive to the flavor, but over the weeks and months you gradually rebuild your palette, grateful for the opportunity to start again and truly appreciate the nuances of all the flavors you experience.  You no longer take any food for granted again, no matter how shitty it might taste.  And so go emotions as flavors in this story. With depression, the feelings you take for granted every day just...disappear. There's no joy, no sadness...just bitterness and resentment.  To quote Sapolsky: ""[Depression is] a genetic/neurochemical disorder requiring a strong environmental trigger whose characteristic manifestation is an inability to appreciate sunsets.""

morbidquestions,3cyol0,eifos,2,Sun Jul 12 10:00:39 2015 UTC,"It was the worst period of my life. Every little thing felt futile. ""why should I bother getting out of bed?"", ""why go to work?"", ""why eat?"". These thoughts plagued me for a year before I sought help. I was smart enough to know that my life wasn't awful. I had a roof over my head, a job, a wonderful family and a loving SO. I never told my family or SO about my depression until after I got treatment because I didn't want to worry them.   A common misconception about depression is that people can just get over it. I had/have a wonderful life, but was still suffering with these thoughts... That I wasn't good enough, I didn't deserve happiness etc.   Imagine feeling sad, no matter what. I had different levels. My default was ""sad"", bad days were ""very sad"", worse days I can't even describe how I felt... Just, entirely worthless. Those were the days I spent all day in bed, which in turn made me feel worse.  While I was suffering depression I was working in retail. Depression is exhausting at the best of times, but working a customer facing job made it so much worse. I spent 8 hours a day, desperately trying not to cry.   When I finally saw a doctor it was such a relief. I'd held everything in for over a year because I thought I didn't have the 'right' to be depressed. So many people had it worse than me, and here I was, spending most days unable to function.   My doctor was very reassuring and making that appointment is the best decision I've made.   These days I no longer suffer with depression. Took medication for a while and decided myself when I felt I could cope without it. After a few weeks I went back on it, but stopped soon after and haven't looked back.   I realise this turned into a bit of a life story, but here's a summary...   For me, depression is constantly feeling like you are not good enough, and unworthy of happiness. It's spending days in bed because you just cannot face the world, it's hiding away from those you love because you can't handle them knowing how far you've fallen. It's a mental, physical, and emotional condition. Left untreated, it can and will ruin your life. It doesn't matter what's going on in your life, depression can hit anybody. Of course, some things can trigger it (death of a loved one etc), but for me, it just happened.   It's not something I'd wish on my worst enemy."

Distribution on deepweb networks like Tor are likely where most proliferation happens, since the regular internet is closely tied to the laws of the countries that 'run' the internet.  I wouldn't say it's all just random basements and backrooms, either. There must be a bias towards countries with high rates of child abuse, coupled with poverty, religious entitlement, or corruption/lack of enforcement[Citation needed].

The natural elements will decompose the body very quickly as water increases the rate of decomposition, I believe but I'm not sure.  If it's a person with a family and with people that look out for them I'd recommend NaOH, Sodium Hydroxide, it dissolves tissue completely. it turns it into this papery substance that you can crush in your hands.

morbidquestions,3cz3d3,Tia00017,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:45:57 2015 UTC,No. I would not.
morbidquestions,3cz3d3,emeraldkilometer,7,Sun Jul 12 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"CLOAKS  One of the earliest accounts of wearing human skin, in 440 BCE the Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the ancient Scythians and their tendency to scalp their victims. The Scythians would sew together their human scalps to make cloaks. This was the ultimate form of boasting and wasn’t for practicality so much as it was so show off how many people they had killed.  Added bonus: they would also use human skin as saddle-cloaks for their horses.  FLAYED PRIESTS OF XIPE TOTEC  A Mayan god of fertility and renewal (also named Our Lord The Flayed One… see where this is going?) was often portrayed wearing flayed human skin. Where it gets creepy is that his priests would emulate this by killing sacrificial victims and then dressing in their skins. The skins were often dyed yellow and referred to as teocuitlaquemitl (“golden clothes”).  Though we may not know exactly what the priests looked like in their flayed costumes, statues of Xipe Totec bear features similar to the Whisperers, like elaborate string ties running along the back of the worn skin. Other eerie aspects of Xipe Totec’s outfit include “double lips” and flayed hands hanging limply from wrists.  ICELANDIC NECROPANTS  You heard me! Originating in Iceland in the 17th century, an Iclandic legend promised endless wealth if you were able to complete this simple task: flay a corpse from the waist down and wear the skin. The main caveat, though, is that these nábrók (“necropants”) need to include everything from the waist down. Everything.  Although officially there are no nábrók remaining in existence, there is a terrifying replica on display at Strandagaldur, The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft.  ED GEIN’S SKIN SUIT  The inspiration for several fictional murderers, including Buffalo Bill and Norman Bates, Ed Gein was a grave-robber and murderer who recycled parts from his victims. In 1954, when his macabre collection was discovered, one of the items in his collection was a suit made entirely of human skin.  HUMAN LEATHER GOODS  Although not necessarily the same as wearing skin over skin, there are several historical instances of humans wearing human leather. There’s even a website where you can purchase human leather goods today, although they are closed to new clients due to high demand.  And clothing isn’t the only thing that we humans can be made into. Ed Gein had a huge collections of objects made from human skin, including an armchair, a belt, a wastebasket, and several lampshades. In addition, our good friend Herodotus had a story about King Cambyses II, who is said to have upholstered a judicial seat with the skin of a (formerly) corrupt judge to serve as a reminder to his successor not to repeat his sins.  RUMORS  Although never proven, there were a few other historical instances of supposed skin-wearing. During the French Revolution, the aristocrats supposedly flayed the bodies of rebels (guillotines produce a lot of waste) and used their skin for clothing. There are also legends of Afghan warlords who made leather clothing out of fallen enemies. While some of this may be propaganda or myth, it’s still provides an interesting example of how wearing human skin has been perceived throughout history, whether it be used to smear reputations or intimidate foes!

It eventually went away on its own, I didn't have psychiatric help since my family didn't have much money, and my mom is one of those people who think mental illnesses are just ""problems rich people make up"" so my treatment was composed of threats like ""stop this bullshit and eat your damn lunch or you'll see what will happen to you.""

I remember feeling like a failure when my period came back after a year of having amenorrhea. Now I have concerns that I could be infertile because of it.  I was never diagnosed anorexic but when I stopped purging it turned into not eating and smoking. It was easier to manage and easier to hide.  Saying you already ate/will eat later is simpler than explaining why you spend half an hour in the bathroom after a meal or dealing with the guilt of binging.   Eating disorders are evil and very, very difficult to shake. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, am much better than I was but still occasionally have invasive thoughts.

morbidquestions,3cyzf8,CakeDice,3,Sun Jul 12 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"Had a friend with anorexia.  Immense, immense, IMMENSE phobia of gaining any weight whatsoever.  She would only drink water, and even then occasionally wondered if the water contained too many minerals and might make her fat.  Had to sit down with her and her boyfriend and spend hours convincing her to eat a single cracker, and that was at the start of her recovery from one particular episode.  And why, in her mind, did she do it?  Various complex reasons, but chief among them was a feeling of control.  In addition to anorexia she had two other mental disorders, Bipolar and PTSD (the latter specifically caused from a horrific incident that left her feeling powerless), and so her rationalization for the anorexia was that it was a way to enforce some measure of control on her life.  Anorexia doesn't give control, of course.  It takes it.  Someone who's suffering from it is almost physically incapable of eating, and their mind is so twisted with terror that a single cracker is equivalent to them as a ""binge"", a smorgasbord that will hideously bloat them.  It's not new either; apparently anorexia is at least three centuries old, possibly much older.  It's a disease.  It is very serious.  And it's true that the most dangerous part of the disease it that those that suffer from it believe that it is ""helping"" them, even if they're AWARE they are suffering from it."

The number of total deaths is probably in there too, but I don't know where, so I'll estimate that 90 million people die per year (1.5% of the total population which used to be 6 billion in 1999). Assuming you are older than 4, you outlived approx. 36 million from that alone. (Being older than 4 means 16 percent of deaths are younger than you every year, but assuming that rate rises linearly to the time that you are 5 -- It wouldn't but it's an approximation -- If it did, you could integrate the area under that curve, but it's really just a triangle with five years in width and 16% in height, so it's equivalent to 40% of 90 million: 36m)  If you're older than 9, add another 72m (16% per year for five years: 80%) to make 108m.  After that, it's closer to 18% (add the percentages of death for 0-4 and 5-9), so if you're older than 14, add another 81m (18% for five years: 90% of 90m  = 81m) to make 199m.  For the next period, it's about 20%, so if you're older than 19, add another 90m to make 289m. For every year that you're older than 14, you're outliving about 1/5 of all people that die that year.  Older than 24, add 110% of 90m = 99m to make 388m  Older than 29, add 120% of 90m = 108m to make 496m  Older than 34, add 130%: 117m to make 603m  Older than 39, add 145%: 130.5m to make 733.5m  At this point, my errors are probably building up a lot on each other, but you get the general idea."

morbidquestions,3cu45e,trashbong,6,Fri Jul 10 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"If there's useful data, it's just that. Data can't be evil. Using information obtained by the Nazis through unethical means does not make the user of said data unethical, so long as further confirmation of said data born additional research is performed ethically.  I think in half a generation, once there isn't really anyone around that remembers the Holocaust as anything but history, I don't think we'll see as much of a debate on this."
morbidquestions,3cu45e,RufusStJames,7,Fri Jul 10 23:32:41 2015 UTC,a lot of the debate surrounds validity of the data - the nazis weren't exactly unbiased and may have manipulated data or scientific methods in order to further their agendas. In addition the atmosphere was very competitive and political so manipulation of data may have occurred for those reasons as well. It's not confirmed (to my knowledge) that any of this is true but the data is highly suspect because of its origins of very clear bias. there's also the non-representative sample argument as many (if not all) participants were extremely emaciated and sick.  It's also not and never going to be peer reviewed (unless another holocaust happens i guess) so there's that too.  hypothermia research was cited a few times for legitimate use (e.g. not ethical discussions about its use). Not familiar with any of the other studies being cited outside of citations in ethical discussion pieces.

morbidquestions,3cokih,ridot,3,Thu Jul 9 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"well, it's a matter of perspective. What exactly does it mean to be ""raised as a girl""?  Are we talking about someone with a penis being raised to believe that they have a vagina? In that case, I don't see those circumstances lasting very long, especially through puberty.  If we're talking raised as a girl as in someone with a penis being arbitrarily ascribed certain denominations of value based off the social construct that is gender, then I'd say it greatly depends.   It really depends on the parents, right? There are qualities which straddle the line of masculinity and femininity which differ for every person. I would say that there is a lot more that could be said about the parents in this scenario.  We can be certain of a few factors, empirically. The parents in this situation obviously subscribe to the belief that there is a ""certain"" or ""proper"" way to raise a child of a given gender. We can also be certain that these parents view specific roles in society as having to be filled by different genders, as denoted by their conscious decision to raise a child with a gender in mind. Finally, we can be certain that these parents are either incapable or unwilling to navigate the nuances of objective existence, which is to say that gender is not something which is naturally occurring, but something children are ascribed at birth and seek to fulfil throughout their life in a society which acknowledges the existence of gender in the first place.  As for the child, I would likely assume the child to be heavily socialized into accepting gender roles and associations on all ends of the spectrum, since the child has been steeped in that ideology their entire life. The cold would have a difficult time in self identifying, as society at large would either lack a category for their upbringing, or attempt to ""rectify"" the child's gender according to its own value systems.  Depending on the child's affinity for various masculinities and femininities, the cold may very well grow into the gender role they were raised to be, or perhaps see that they don't necessarily fit with their assigned gender and identify as the ""opposite"".  The net result is the same, on all accounts, the false notion of the objective existence of gender would be made to appear valid.  Sorry for the long response, this is something I'm pretty passionate about. How I could help lend some insight, even if some may disagree."

morbidquestions,3ciq6d,Tain101,37,Wed Jul 8 05:43:36 2015 UTC,"Cutting can be a touchy subject, because it has a lot of attention seeking connotations. Undoubtedly, often it is a ""cry for help"". But not in the ""I need attention"" kind of way, more like, ""I don't know what's wrong with me, and I don't know how to tell anyone or if I even should"". For those reasons it comes with a lot of shame and self-blame.  There are different reasons people self-harm. It can be driven by sexual desires, depression, or the rush as you describe it.   For me it came from emotional pain. Instead of feeling a specific negative emotion, I would feel a big mass of ""blackness"". Have you ever been so pissed off or frustrated or just hurt that you wanted to punch something? Like you were just going to explode? That's how I felt. But I couldn't punch something, because I didn't want anyone to know I was feeling this pain.   I have bitten, scratched, burnt and cut myself at various times in my life. I am deeply, deeply ashamed of it. I couldn't tell you what the first time felt like, I don't remember it.  I've heard some people describe it as an addiction, but I never felt that ""rush"" or endorphins release. It was just a violent act that transformed the emotional pain into physical pain. For that reason I don't think the effect ever ""diminished"" for me.  It kind of became a cycle, for a while. To an extent it still is. One specific example, I was wearing a pair of shorts, that showed some of the scars on my thighs. My mum told me that I couldn't go out in public wearing them, because it would make people uncomfortable.   That shame and guilt brought with it all the negative emotions that led to the scars being there in the first place. I hated myself. I felt worthless. So I did it again.   At other times I did it just to feel ""something"" instead of nothing. Other times it was a form of punishment. Sometimes it was to stop me from bursting at other people.   As far as why normal cuts don't have the same effect... Because you don't control them. It's not a choice against yourself, its an accident. Self-harm is an act of violence against your own body. It allows you to express your feelings towards yourself. The only thing I've experienced a similar feeling as cutting is when I'm getting tattooed.  When it feels good: different methods have different effects. Biting feels good during -- not on my arm (where I bite), but in my jaw and rest of my body. Cutting it's more the moment before and after. After I realise what I've done to myself, I feel awful.  TL;DR: It's a coping mechanism. A very unhealthy coping mechanism. It doesn't feel ""good"", but it feels better than ""bad""... at least for a moment. Then you hate yourself all over."

morbidquestions,3ciq6d,Soul_Purpose,3,Wed Jul 8 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a regular self harmer, but I have occasionally done it in the past during particularly bad episodes of chronic depression. I'm on medication for depression, and I've never attempted suicide or injured myself badly. My experiences and thoughts are just mine and I don't claim to speak for everyone who's self harmed!  For me, I really like to be in control of my life. I'm an incredibly easy going, 'go with the flow' sort of person and dislike structure in my life but I hate sudden change and things going against my personal plan. I hate not being in control of myself. When you're depressed, getting control over your life is incredibly difficult, like climbing everest. Depending on your personal situation, it could be like taking a rocket to Mars. I'm very poor, currently unemployed while looking for work, have mental illness issues and have to rely on my SO for any and all financial support. It's tough to handle having absolutely no control over your life and being life's bitch.  Following that, the times that I caused self harm, it was for a couple of things:   Being in control of something that I had caused. Unable to control my emotions, my self worth and my external life, controlling physical feeling is something of a blessing. The pain and mark is yours, you have created it, nobody can take it from you. Attempt to cut yourself and it WILL happen, there's no degree of uncertainty. You know your intention, how it will happen, and the aftermath. There's a comforting knowledge in that, that at least you have total control over your body to inflict some degree of feeling on it. With a normal cut - say, cutting yourself accidentally with a kitchen knife like I did last month - is the total opposite of that feeling. It's shock, it wasn't expected, you weren't prepared for it and the pain and you cannot control the situation surrounding the injury. The pain itself feels very different and sharper. For many people this aspect of control becomes a sort of ritual for them; the preparing of the razor, the feeling before the cut, feelings after, the aftercare, etc, it's something that is all controllable and owned by you and only you. For me, the core emotion during a depressive episode is total lack of self worth and esteem. My negative thoughts often surround the idea that I'm not good enough and that I deserve what I get and I deserve this emotional pain. That translates to physical pain. I have a terrible habit of wanting to punish myself for my mess-ups and my lack of ambition (completely non kinky). Sometimes it's in the form of refusing to sleep so I can be punished with exhaustion, sometimes it's self starvation, and those occasional times it's been cutting. Physical pain inflicted by yourself feels easier to handle that such severe emotional pain like 'I'm worthless and I don't deserve to be alive.' There's no nonsense with physical pain and it's only surface deep. Cutting is sort of like, 'You deserve to be marked and feel this pain' and afterwards there's a sense of release and a calming feeling that I've been punished and deserved it and now I can rest from that overwhelming need. Physical pain is much easier to focus on than emotions so you sort of have this floating feeling where the only thing that matters in that moment is feeling that pain and not dealing with the depression and thoughts. It is sort of a high in that regard and probably why others who have the same emotions about it become addicted to cutting.   My personal favourite part was the mark afterwards. It was sort of like claiming that space on my body as mine. It was something that reflected my emotions during that point, and now it was over and was healing. It's fucked up but I would feel really satisfied feeling the welt and scabs left and running my fingers over them, sort of like a reminder of the control that I could feel.  Anyway those are my thoughts on it, again they don't reflect everybody's feelings and views of self harm, just my own personal observations. Sorry it was a bit long and detailed!"
morbidquestions,3ciq6d,drysider,3,Wed Jul 8 06:34:31 2015 UTC,"Physically, it feels like getting cut normally, but a bit slower cause you're usually hesitant. Not cause you're scared or anything, but because your body instinctually fears pain. Immediately after it feels numb, but then a stinging sensation sets in, and it grows more painful depending on where and how deep you cut. It's at this point you start feeling relieved and calm  For me cutting was a way of punishing myself for my ""sins"", even though I wasn't and still am not religious. Each cut meant that I my punishment was good enough, and that I wouldn't face some karmatic retaliation for whatever I'd done.  The first time for me was actually quiet the relief even though it wasn't deliberate cutting per se. I was having an anxiety attack, and sunk my nails into the skin on my arm and started scratching like I was going after an itch. I dissociated and when I realized what I was doing I'd ripped down to blood. It felt relaxing sorta, probably because of the endorphin release.  I never did it regularly enough for it to happen, but I imagine cutting excessively would build up a tolerance, in the same way thrill seekers always want scarier and more dangerous situations. That's a psychological high as well.   Hope I helped some. I'm a bit woozy from some medication heh"
morbidquestions,3ciq6d,SquidsStoleMyFace,3,Wed Jul 8 08:29:31 2015 UTC,"When I cut, it was because cutting made me feel... nothing. Hollow. And that was better than the depression I was feeling at the time. So it was kind of like a high or addiction, in that I wanted to feel numb rather than suffer. The act of actually cutting myself hurt but the pain was distracting.  Normal cuts had a similar effect on me to be honest. I could squeeze a normal cut, feel the pain, and focus on it. They're just Harder to come by naturally."
morbidquestions,3ciq6d,areraswen,3,Wed Jul 8 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"I used to do it because I hated myself but didn't want to commit suicide. I've been ""clean"" for quite a while now, but honestly sometimes I miss it. It isn't like a normal cut because you can control it, you can stop when you want and make it as deep or shallow as you like. The ones on my wrist bought a kind of high to them, where I felt back to normal. During my depression I often felt like I wasn't there, or that I was behind a wall, so cutting helped with that. The ones on my leg/elsewhere were more rash and less controlled and didn't feel as good, in the sense that they were just a backlash of anger and were a part of being completely overwhelmed with everything."
morbidquestions,3ciq6d,OperatingOnScientist,3,Wed Jul 8 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time depressed person here, I've struggled with self-harm for a really long time. I feel like in order to truly understand self-harm you need to understand the context you're in when you self-harm. You're depressed, you're so depressed you can't move. You want to die, but you have no energy to do so, you just want to be swallowed up by a hole. You're laying on the floor, crying your eyes out. All you want is to die. You're so depressed you feel apathetic and empty and everything inside of you have been eaten up. You haven't felt anything in a while, not fear, not happiness, not even sadness. You're nothing. You cut to feel something. You get the razor and find a spot. You press it into your leg, you feel anger, you hate yourself. You pull the razor and creates a large cut in your leg. Your heart beats fast, you feel endorphins run through your body. You feel something finally. You feel angry, you feel sad, you feel excited. Blood trickles down your leg and you dab your fingers in it. You feel disgust and curiosity. I does feel good. The endorphins feel good. It's scary the first time but you teach yourself to love it. The effect wears off as you keep doing it, so you escalate.  Normal cuts do not have the same effect. When you're self harming you're doing it out of anger, sadness, self-loathing, you're punishing yourself, and you have control. You have all these things when you need it the most."

You can even do it at work.   Scratching is another good one. My friends took my knives, but they cant take my nails. If youre into scarification nails are a lot safer than knives too.

For me I guess there was a bit of endorphin release, but it was mostly just like a clearing of a headache or a refreshing breath of air. It's something to focus on so the thoughts go away. For me the sensations never dulled because I didn't do it for the feelings. Felt just as pleasant the first time as the last. Normal injuries also are somewhat ""nice"" and give the same affects endorphin wise, but I lose the mental affects of calm and focus because it's a fast occurrence. When I cut it's slow and deliberate.   I don't cut anymore. I guess it was somewhat addictive because it was ""fun"" to do and better than being stuck crying until my jaw ached (which was not enjoyable because it was a dull, extended pain, rather than sharp which I prefer). Cuts didn't even hurt me to be honest. The first initial opening of the skin hurt a little, but as I deepened it, the skin went numb. At most it was sensitive. Even as I healed it didn't actually hurt. Anywho, is became longer than I intended sorry. I stopped cutting awhile ago because my parents grew concerned and I hate to make them worried and now when I feel self destructive I just punch myself to focus on the pain and release that way."

The first time I did it wasn't a good experience, I was scared and straight after felt guilty.

If you own a house, sell it, and rent one on a short term lease, so that doesn't have to be dealt with.  So now you have no debts, and some cash surplus.  This is where timing comes into it. Find the address for the local police department, and address a letter to the department that deals with death and crap. In the letter, let them know you're gonna die, give them a key to your apartment, let them know what room you're in. Let them know about the money, telling them it's for the costs of clean up and body disposal. Also maybe let them know about one or two relatives to inform.  Post the letter on a Saturday, so you've got all of Saturday and Sunday to make sure you've actually died.  Now, in a bathroom (making sure all floors are lined with plastic just in case), off yourself in the bathtub somehow.

There appear to be no major difference between gay and straight men in terms of stereotypical 'feminine' behaviours: think choice of clothing, makeup, dress, stereotypical interests such as shopping etc.   However, studies have shown most people can differentiate between gay men from straight men based on voice, mannerisms etc. The problem is, these aren't really ""feminine"" traits - they are ""gay"" traits. Because of this studies on ""effeminate"" behaviour tend to miss them.  As always there is individual variation, but you are certainly not being ignorant or stereotyping by noticing a difference.

He recognised other people felt empathy for him, but couldn't feel empathy for them. He used that to manipulate them.

morbidquestions,3chm63,queefer_sutherland92,3,Wed Jul 8 05:59:39 2015 UTC,"My favourite topic I studied in school. Questioning your own behaviour would not be a sign you're a psychopath, psychopaths could question their courses of action all the time and have it not affect their condition. Being a psychopath means that you have a set of certain qualities such as charm, glibness, selfishness, and extreme egocentricity. Most psychopaths are non-violent and simply get through life by being manipulative to those around them. Psychopaths know that they are different. From a young age they recognize that others are able to feel love and empathize. Psychopaths understand the idea of emotions and they also understand that they do not have them. Imagine a world where the opposite was true...you'd recognize you were different quite quick. So in a nutshell psychopaths know they are different and use it to their advantage. They recognize their tendencies and justify them by their enlarged egos and a feeling of entitlement or don't feel the need to justify them at all. Questioning your behaviour is not an indicator of psychopathy. For further reading I'd suggest starting by looking into the PCL-R and checking out anything by Dr. Robert Hare."

Every living being have this objective in their DNA."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Goodbye_Kenny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:47:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, but you make it sound as if it was a decision. The ones who didn't avoid death died before reproducing, therefore the others remained."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Sohprotem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:44 2015 UTC,That wasn't my intention. How would you phrase it?
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Darkm1tch69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"Nevermind, I read it again and I think it was just me being obsessive.  I read the 'If species didn't have an instilled drive to live in them they would die out by simply not caring.' as species having developed that drive to avoid death."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Sohprotem,11,Mon Jul 13 05:02:02 2015 UTC,"Ooh this is a good question, I'll try my best to answer it.   Humans were developed in a way that lot of individuals like to live, they like doing things, they take joy in life and the things it provides. Having sex feels good, eating food feels good. Both of these things are pretty much essential to living.   Its the same with animals except they are dumber and probably think it's extremely stupid to kill yourself just because you can, they just wanna eat grass/meat/fish and have sex.   It would be simpler to have Earth stay lifeless, but there are so many things in so many different nook and crannies that having them all suddenly stop reproducing would be next to impossible.   People cling stubbornly to their lives because they are not scared of dying, they are scared of what's after and what they could have done. ""What if I go to hell?"" or ""Why didn't I spend more time with my son?"" are questions that people usually ask when confronted with their death.   Pain isn't a reason to stop living."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,PepperJohn,3,Tue Jul 7 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"Curiously some animals don't find some activities as enjoyable as us and some of then may even result painful, like sex. But I suppose many animals, especially mammals, have a strong family and group instinct just like we."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,PepperJohn,5,Tue Jul 7 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well sex is enjoyable to a lot of people/species but that doesn't mean every species finds it enjoyable, a large amount do it just to produce offspring. They probably find having offspring and increasing their kind to be a pretty  enjoyable activity."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,ShetlandJames,3,Tue Jul 7 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Good point; not the act itself, but the results."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Tupptupp_XD,6,Tue Jul 7 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"Living is difficult   Completing Halo on Legendary was difficult but I still did it, and I was in no way obliged to do it. Why did I do it? The challenge. Living is difficult, but if you can manage the difficulty and get better at that then living becomes fun."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Tupptupp_XD,3,Tue Jul 7 20:04:36 2015 UTC,"We avoid death because that's the way we evolved. We wouldn't be here if we had no regard for our lives. Same with pain, we avoid it because pain usually signifies a risk to our lives, and we try to get rid of the pain to get rid of the risk to our lives.   Not sure if I agree with ""living is difficult"" sure it can be sometimes, but there are way too many things to experience that make life worth living.  We cling to our lives partially because of instinct, and partly because of the prospect of good things to come."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Tupptupp_XD,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but why we have evolved this way instead of feeling near death experiences pleasant? Sure, this will ensure natural selection and that the genes are passed along the next generationss; what I don't get is that if there's a reason beyond that, a reason why nature wants or needs to arrange cells into complex multicellular organisms, if at the end the cycle repeats and they will break up."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Tupptupp_XD,3,Tue Jul 7 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a reason. Like chemical reactions, they just happen. Nature isn't a sentient being, it doesn't 'decide' to create complex organisms. If life comes into existence, so be it."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Tupptupp_XD,2,Wed Jul 8 06:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'll wonder if there's a physical law that allows nature to start forming organisms, like a path it follows naturally...I hope that by asking this I'm not overthinking it haha"
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Nick84572,3,Wed Jul 8 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Organisms are just lots of complex chemical reactions that result in something that can reproduce, respond to stimuli, etc. I don't think there is something that 'gives permission' to nature to make life specifically, since everything else just happens naturally."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,ridot,2,Wed Jul 8 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"Under certain circumstances, that is. Laws of physics have a reason to be, gravity pulls down because larger bodies attract smaller ones; but maybe the same doesn't applies to biology and nature doesn't has any laws or whatsoever. Perhaps life and nature it's just a casualty?"
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,akimbocorndogs,3,Thu Jul 9 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"Well, biology is sort of a 'branch' of chemistry. Chemistry studies matter, biology studies living matter, in a sense. Biology does follow laws of chemistry/physics such as conservation of energy, but I don't think it has it's own set of laws. I think you're right about life and nature being a casualty. Laws of chemistry and physics will exist anyway, presumably throughout the entire universe, but any rules we make about biology only exist for the biology on earth."
morbidquestions,3cg8yl,Epichp,2,Thu Jul 9 07:17:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me a little of this comic. I think this is the most satisfying answer I've received so far, thank you very much!"
morbidquestions,3cgb31,Zeoxsys,10,Tue Jul 7 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"Coming from a volunteer firefighter it is a strange smell. It is a very distinguished scent, similar to when  any live animal burns. Think of the smell of burning hair but much more robust and volitile."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,dkleberjohn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:00 2015 UTC,Bite off a finger nail set it on fire and let me know how close I am. I may sacrifice a finger.
morbidquestions,3cgb31,poorly_timed_leg0las,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:32 2015 UTC,Not close enough. The blood smell is missing which is a key component. Take a pig that wasn't drained of blood and light it on fire. That'd be closer
morbidquestions,3cgb31,dkleberjohn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:56:12 2015 UTC,"You don't know how accurate you are. Having smelled both, and a few other animals (I lead an interesting, if tragic, life; entirely not my doing, though - wrong place wrong time and all that), I have to say burning pig is nearly identical to burning human."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,TheGurw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:58:16 2015 UTC,Well our skins are very similar in their structure and we have similar muscular and organ features so it makes sense.
morbidquestions,3cgb31,dkleberjohn,8,Wed Jul 8 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"After the fact it's very reminiscent of barbecue pork. My ex-fiances mom was the director of the medical examiners office where I live, and I've smelled my share of dead bodies. It's pretty morbid to see a burn victim and then realize the whole office wants barbecue."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,danny_fiasco,12,Tue Jul 7 21:05:18 2015 UTC,Give me a second.

morbidquestions,3cgb31,Burning_Titan,0,Wed Jul 8 00:16:02 2015 UTC,"I feel REALLY good right now, the smell eventually becomes comfo... of course it has nothing to do with anything that occurred in the past 5 hours, goodbye."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,SnakeEyedJane,3,Wed Jul 8 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much fat and hair are on the body, and how it's being burned, among other things. I work in an OR, and when a wound is being cauterized or electrocautery is being used in general, it actually smells like sewage, in my opinion. Like oily sewage, and the smell lingers. As far as burn victims fresh pulled from a fire, I don't think that it smells like pork (rancid pork, maybe, slightly), and I think that people just tend to repeat that old wives tale. It's definitely a little gamey and a LOT of burnt hair smell, and a bit of sewage."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,Twentymenthol,2,Wed Jul 8 01:56:29 2015 UTC,"It does smell somewhat like beef or pork. Burning fat, to me, is a sickening smell something like gristle. But it's not too outwardly foreign, it really does smell like red meat; because it is."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,sassy_zoo_lulu,2,Tue Jul 7 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"My grandmother was a teen in the second world war, she once told me that a plane came down close to where she was living at the time. She said it smelled just like roast pork."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,Chopes_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"Hubby won't eat roast pork, because he says that first waft as you start to carve it reminds him of a work place accident he witnessed. Plumber was in the bottom of a trench,  dropped an oxygen acetylene torch (I think?) and it burnt the back of his calf. He was twisted in an awkward position and couldn't move out of the line of flame. Hubby says the entire work site smelled delicious for the rest of the day. In saying that, it's only roast pork he can't stomach. Ribs, cutlets, scotch fillet etc are all fine."
morbidquestions,3cgb31,Aestiva,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"Not an expert, but probably like burned steak."
