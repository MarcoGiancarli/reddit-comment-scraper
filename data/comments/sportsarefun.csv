sportsarefun,3ds3pd,viper9,32,Sat Jul 18 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"That tiny little trophy is the biggest prize in test cricket. It's called 'the ashes'. A series of test matches (5 day long matches) are played between Australia and England every 2 years for this great prize. It's an urn which holds the burnt bails (the little things on top of the stumps - the 3 poles behind the batsman) from the 1882 test match between these 2 nationals at ""the oval"" in England. A paper ran a story to say that cricket had died, after England were beaten by the upstart Australians and burnt the bails in ceremony.   Since then it's become a great rivalry between the 2 countries and very very hard fought. The original ashes urn sits in the hall of fame at Lords in England."

sportsarefun,3clf26,TweetPoster,5,Thu Jul 9 00:38:12 2015 UTC,I guess there would be technicalities due to the fact that it's confusing to the batter and gives the pitcher an advantage. Similar to the ambidextrous pitcher clause they have now. If it weren't a rule at first there would be the following season.

sportsarefun,3bi9v5,dsquard,14,Mon Jun 29 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"http://m.mlb.com/video/v207760783/must-c-classic-steven-matz-has-a-historic-debut  Go about 1:10 in. The play in the GIF was a 2RBI single, after a previous plate appearance was a 2RBI double.  For those who don't know baseball, pitchers usually are really bad at hitting. Matz shows on his first day in the Majors that he's not afraid to swing a bat."
sportsarefun,3bi9v5,bellpepper,5,Mon Jun 29 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"He went 3 for 3, batting 1.000. He hit in 4 RBI's.    He pitched 8 innings, had 5 hits, and 2 runs.  He broke the league record for most RBI's from a debut pitcher. He tied the Mets' record [Held by the amazing Dwight Gooden] for most RBI's by a pitcher in a single game.    Dude killed it."

sportsarefun,3b1cqf,Syren__,11,Thu Jun 25 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"It looks like they were in a tournament, so if the ref felt it was appropriate, he could have issued a black card to the stabber which ends the match in favor of ground guy. Actually, you can see the light go off on the scoreboard, which indicates that he made contact, so it would be up to the ref whether to issue a card at all, and then again to what severity. There are 3 kinds of card in fencing, yellow, red, and black. (Yellow is a warning (like soccer) red awards your opponent 1 point, and black means you forfeit the match.)  EDIT:Actually it looks like I misread what you said. Floor guy, upon falling, stops the point, and neither fencer can score."

I think the difference is that blackface conjures a period in entertainment including minstrel shows and the like - a time when black actors were not hired, and their depictions were almost exclusively the ""happy-go-lucky, dim-witted plantation worker.""

sportsarefun,39ax9c,blockdmyownshot,9,Thu Jun 11 07:15:39 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I think Del Potro was using a racket that isn't made anymore so he was just restringing the remaining ones he had over and over. He probably would have given it to her if it was easily replaceable.

That's why you see the guys outside the bullpen ignore him, then when they cut back to him running through the dugout is after he realizes he's getting the silent treatment so he runs through celebrating by himself. Then you see all the other players laugh and get up to congratulate him.  EDIT: Some examples:   Edwin (a big time power hitter), getting his first of the year and everyone just leaves the dugout  Here's a good reaction to one, Schafer hits his first homer  One of the best pitchers in the league gets silent treatment after his first homer  Scooter Gennett getting a long cold shoulder after a big homer"

So he played it off and celebrated with his imaginary friends."
sportsarefun,357cud,phl_fc,2,Thu May 7 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"In baseball, when a player hits a homerun or scores a run, it's customary for all players in the dugout get up to give the player high fives as he is walking into the dugout. Silent treatment is a light-hearted, prank where the teammates stay sitting down and ignore the scoring player like nothing happened. It usually works best when the homerun is a significant achievement for that player, such as the first career homerun."

They took the option to take a tap (tap the ball on your foot and play resumes). However the opposition has to be back a certain amount of meters and once the ball has been tapped they can move forward and make a tackle.

Wednesday was a day that both Baltimore and Chicago originally had off, so it was convent for them to make up this game. The alternative to using off days is to play double headers, but that ends up being very taxing on pitchers arms. I think the rescheduled games from Monday and Tuesday have created a situation where Baltimore now has to play 21 games in 20 days later this year. Hopefully no ones hurt when they hit that stretch because just the schedule alone is going to make it difficult."

People there can't get enough of this game given that it's the first time ever that a MLB game was played to an empty stadium. They've dubbed it Schrödinger's Baseball Game.  http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/34be5b/white_sox_orioles_highlights_with_park_audio_no/  That post has a bunch of highlights with no commentary. The game sounds completely different with how everything echoes and you can hear a lot of sounds that normally get drown out by the crowd. The sad ballgirl and Thorne's golf commentary call are pretty funny.  In an interview after the game Buck Showalter said he called the bullpen and could actually here the phone ring all the way past the outfield wall.

Ditto things like attacking tender bits, eye gouging, etc.    Jiguro Kano is remembered mostly because he came up with a system that was both effective to use and safe to practice.    Do not get it twisted. That shit hurts."

A red is worth 1 point, and the colours are worth more points, with black being the most (7 points). A 147 is the maximum break you can get in Snooker. By potting red, black, red, black etc until all reds are gone, then potting all colours in order.   The best way to play snooker is to make sure the white ball ends up in line with your next ball, making it easier. He potted a red and left the ball mid-table for him to pot the pink. He then realises he should have gone for the black instead, as the pink is worth 6 points, which would mean he could then get a maximum of 146.  Getting a 147 is a big deal in snooker. Most major players have got a few in their life, but it's still rare."

sportsarefun,33kqkm,I_see_your_value_now,4,Thu Apr 23 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"To score in snooker you must first pot a red ball for 1 point. Following this you can pot a coloured ball scoring 2 for yellow, 3 for Green  4 for Brown,  5 for Blue, 6 for pink and 7 for black. Once all 15 red balls have been potted you pot the colours from yellow to black.   If you can pot all 15 reds with accompanying blacks in succession without missing a shot you will have made a 147 break. This is a pretty prestigious thing to do and it also generally carries a huge prize fund.   Add to this it was at The World Championship, the biggest event in the snooker calendar. He had done most of the legwork in potting 10 red and blacks but then he lost concentration. Denying himself a 147 and a big prize.   Edit: to clarify what he actually did wrong was he should of potted the red ball in a way that made it easy for him to pot the black ball rather than the blue."

sportsarefun,32k8cb,LordAssworthMcThor,130,Tue Apr 14 13:55:12 2015 UTC,Kevin Garnett is player in the NBA. He started at the Timberwolves and was there from 1995 - 2006 season. He just came back after a decade hiatus at the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets.
sportsarefun,32k8cb,avickthur,60,Tue Apr 14 13:56:43 2015 UTC,And they absolutely love Garnett there.
sportsarefun,32k8cb,macdoogles,54,Tue Apr 14 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"To add even more context, Kevin Garnett won an MVP award with the Minnesota Timberwolves but never won a championship there. Minnesota is a ""small market"" team and traditionally they struggle to stay competitive. Garnett was very loyal though and only left after they traded him to Boston where he eventually won a championship. He's back with Minnesota now after almost a decade although he's probably about to retire soon and isn't the same type of player he used to be. Still, he's beloved in Minnesota and his return home was probably emotional. OP's gif kind of completes the loop."
sportsarefun,32k8cb,b242,16,Tue Apr 14 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, I completely forgot KG won an MVP there."
sportsarefun,32k8cb,derrman,45,Tue Apr 14 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"To add to OP's explanation, that is the same guy in both clips. His name is John ""Jiggly Boy"" Sweeney and he owns a comedy theater in Minneapolis."

sportsarefun,32k8cb,derrman,7,Tue Apr 14 18:32:14 2015 UTC,I think it is the Brave New Workshop. I saw it earlier but cannot find the article again for the life of me.
sportsarefun,32k8cb,Ryan_Firecrotch,4,Tue Apr 14 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"To add to the other people's explanations: here's the league history around this. Kevin Garnett is one of the best players of all time at his position (Power Forward, basically a tall strong player that is still mobile) and brought success to a terrible franchise (the Timberwolves) that continued to use years of his prime. He was the most beloved Timberwolves player of all time, and won the coveted league MVP for the first time in the team's history. In 2006, after giving them the 'Wolves ample time to put talent around him and have a great season, he left for the Boston Celtics, and gave that franchise another great era alongside great players Paul Pierce and Ray Allen (amongst others). The '06-'10 Celtics were more than great with Kevin Garnett, and KG was awarded the Defensive Player of the Year (frankly, he should've been MVP) while leading the team to a championship for the first time in a decade in 2008.  Fast forward 9 more years, and Kevin Garnett is the longest-running NBA player, having spent over half his life in the league. He's a decade out of his prime, and is having a messy season with the Brooklyn Nets. The Timberwolves are amongst the worst teams in the league - STILL - and they traded a very young player for the last year of Kevin Garnett's expensive contract. This is understood entirely to be fan service, and this video was taken at his first game back. The only KG discussion right now is whether or not he'll retire after this season (which is just about over right now)."

Fielder just started calmly walking towards Gonzales, and Gonzales started to walk back to the plate for some reason, or maybe to the dugout. But then realized he had to get tagged, so just fist bumped him and was out."

sportsarefun,32bx05,focusmitch,6,Mon Apr 13 13:39:11 2015 UTC,He has to tag the guy with the ball for him to be out. He already has the ball and there's no other way around him so he just walks over to him and lets him tag him.

sportsarefun,32bx05,Ells86,2,Wed Apr 15 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. Baselines are more than just guidelines for what is foul and what is fair. The baserunner cannot move a certain amount of space away from the line when making his way down to first base. Same for third base to home.  From first to second and second to third, there are imaginary lines that also must be upheld in a similar manner. Basically if you intentionally run outside those lines, you're automatically out."
sportsarefun,32bx05,killer_pancake,2,Tue Apr 21 17:21:57 2015 UTC,I think that the guy got thrown out but still had to be tagged
sportsarefun,32bx05,bear_trap_ouch,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:28:29 2015 UTC,I don't think he got thrown out because Fielder was on the grass at the beginning of the gif.

sportsarefun,31mcdw,Tasslehoff,3,Mon Apr 6 16:27:30 2015 UTC,It's dangerous because if your whole team is on your own half the other team is free to kick off immediately. So any celebration with the keeper either has to be on the opponent's half or leave a different player on the opponents half.

sportsarefun,30yit1,NoEngrish,9,Tue Mar 31 19:49:32 2015 UTC,Fouling would be the right strategy for the losing team (Villanova in this case) in order to get the ball back. It is not the normal strategy for a team who is up by 6.
sportsarefun,30yit1,ubiquitous_usurper,6,Tue Mar 31 20:51:12 2015 UTC,I've watched a lot of basketball and never seen a team up 6 intentionally foul on the opposite court. Why would you send them to the line for an opportunity for 2 free throws (high percentage shots) when you could just play defense and make them shoot and off balance jump shot?  Obviously I get this was a unique scenario but if a coach did that normally people would definitely be questioning it.
sportsarefun,30yit1,ubiquitous_usurper,5,Wed Apr 1 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"7 seconds is a lot of time. So why are you going to stop the clock 70 feet from the basket and give up 2 easy points? Make them waste time trying to set up a low percentage 3 pointer and make sure not to foul. Even if they do hit a 3, they still would have taken several precious seconds off the clock."

Sports are all about achievement through merit; the pride they instill for accomplishments like this are about having earned it, not having it handed to you (at least for me).   I would have genuinely been upset if with ~8 seconds to go I still had a chance to earn that 1000 point plateau, but the opposing coach robbed me of that chance and in the process made a mockery of the game and my achievement. I'd much rather end my career with an honest 999 than a forced 1000."
