udub,3e69zb,myncknm,5,Wed Jul 22 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not female, but I knew several girls who lived on the Ave, including one who volunteered at a shelter, and one who was among the homeless herself.  Your risk of being hurt is very low. The crime data reports a few assaults in the area, but these are generally personal fights between people who know each other (and who might be drunk). The homeless people on the Ave generally stay out of the way of students (except to ask for change, of course).  Theft is a risk, but I don't think the risk is much higher on the Ave than any other living space, except the dorms that are on campus.  There will generally be plenty of students wandering around the Ave up until the early hours of the morning.  People think of anything above 50th as a bit scary, because it's not as busy up there, and the parking lot of the Jack-in-the-Box on that street corner is a frequent homeless hangout.

udub,3dh0pa,HobsMan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"Overall I think the criteria for in-state vs. out-of-state DA's are very similar. The point of the DA program is to attract students who would otherwise go to other prestigious universities for their CS programs, to instead come to UW. Therefore if you are a top of the line student who has potential to get into other top tier CS programs, I don't think they really mind whether you are in-state or out-of-state. I of course do not know 100% if this is the case, but this is what I would assume.  Therefore I would say the in-state averages that you have found, as well as the numbers that have been posted are probably good rough estimates for what any DA potential might need, regardless of in-state or out-of-state. As a final thing, the one person I know who was a DA had gone to a private school and taken around 9-10 IB courses and managed a top score in all but 1 I think. They also had near a 4.0, if not a 4.0 GPA (sorry, I don't remember the specifics)."

udub,3db8gb,MrMattyCakes,10,Tue Jul 14 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"I've had plenty of unsuccessful and successful interactions with Brooke. Here's what I do:  1) Boil down what you need assistance with to a small blurb. The first thing she will say is, ""What's your question?"" or something like that. If you bumble around and have no idea why you need her help, she will be even more pissed off than usual. For example, I needed to drop a class for medical reasons and my schedule is pretty strict, my blurb was ""Due to me having too many credits, I'm on a pretty strict schedule to graduation. For Medical reasons, I can't successfully maintain this schedule, and I would like to make sure my new plan will work for the department"". After hearing that, she immediately went into asking me what she needed to know to make sure I would be ok.   2) Do as much background research as you can. If you are missing information that can be found online, that will piss her off and make her less likely to assist you.   3) Have an idea of a solution. If you have a unique case, have an idea of what you want from them. They waste a lot of time on people who don't really need anything. Having an idea of what you want, or what you want to outcome to be helps a lot.  Is Brooke a mean person? OH YEAH. Is she a bad advisor? No. The fact is, Brooke knows everything about the math department. If she tells you something, you know it's true. She's incredibly difficult to talk to, but as much as Katharine is nice to talk to, I'd rather have to pull the definitive word out of Brooke's mouth and pleasantly listen to nice (but not necessarily true) things out of Katharine's.   You can go ahead and change your advising appointment, but trust me when I say that if I get the answer from Brooke, I feel a million times more confident than when I get the answer from Katharine (or the other one)."

That won't help your gpa. I would suggest you replace MATH 125 with either STAT 221 or QMETH 201 for stats prereq. Also replace your MATH 126 with something fun or a Diversity credit, I&S, NW, or VLPA (diversity credit can be a I&S, NW, or VLPA). You would be taking that as the same time as ACCTG 215 which is notoriously the business major equivalent to a weed out class.  Honestly, I never seen a business major take so many engl classes. If what you are saying is true, you are already good for ENGL 131/111. You don't need ENGL 281. It doesnt look better. I talked to the Foster's advisor before. They don't care what you take or where you take the classes. They only care about your gpa/grades. So dont take classes like MATH 125 and 126 amd ENGL 281 that can possibly destroy you gpa thinking it looks better. It doesnt. They don't care. Replace your ENGL 281 with a fun GE like I mentioned before. If you care about VLPA, I suggest a film class. They are so chill. You watch movies and write papers and no tests.   If you want a writing credit, you can always do the B lecture of MUSIC 162.(only in spring )Its really easy and it will count as same thing as reg MUSIC 162 but with a quiz section dedicated to writing credit.  Also be careful with CSE 142 for a GE. Unless you genuinely want to learn progarmming/java, I suggest you find a different NW course.   Also, at this rate, you can even apply for fall of your sophomore year. You can take ACCTG 225 and MGMT 200 while you are applying and do it in the fall. And take the WSA (writing test for Foster's) in the spring of freshmen year and fall of sophomore year. And If you don't get in, you can always apply in the spring again.   Hope this helps you! Go explore the class schedules for probably better options of classes. If you have any more questions, I can help"

udub,3dcdb0,jaesuk97,3,Sat Jul 18 07:37:38 2015 UTC,"For your first quarter, that is incredibly unreasonable. The typical courseload is 2 STEM classes and one general ed, and here you have 3 accelerated STEM classes, and a general ed. (Edit: Whoops, read that as ""Math 136 and PHYS 121B"", not ""or"".)  What major are you going for? Drop one of those STEM classes, and of what you have left, I would advise only doing honors for one of those classes. I appreciate the dedication but I doubt you would even have enough time in the day to do all of those classes if you never had to sleep or eat. CSE 143x should be fine if you are already taking one honors class though, from what I've heard it's the same workload as regular 142/143, it just moves faster.  Anyways, PM me if you're curious about PHYS 121B specifically, I took the series last year and it was a lot of fun. There's going to be a different teacher and textbook for this year, though.  If you do want to take math 13x, just start from 134. I believe 134 covers 124-5, 135 covers 126-307, and 136 covers 308. The class moves so quickly that it won't be that big of a deal to review 124-5 in the first quarter (I attended a lecture once and I could barely keep up with what the teacher was saying). It's also covered a lot more in depth, since it's proof based."

The PHYS series is very time consuming and work heavy. I haven't actually taken it so I can't speak for myself.  2) True. Everyone has to take a ENGL 111/121/131 credit.  3) Personally I would do 125 then 126, but lots of people go straight into 126 from HS and do fine. But people also do very badly because they're not used to UW math classes yet. 125 is mostly integration and works in 2D. 126 is about vectors/planes, partial derivatives, Taylor series, and works mostly in 3D. I believe CSE cares more about your 126 grade than 125."
udub,3db7gz,acciaccatura-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:05 2015 UTC,In regards to the math it varies from person to person. I really enjoyed going right to 126. It is brand new material and as long as you stay on top of it: read the book and go to office hours. it should be fine.
udub,3db7gz,Sarl_Cagen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"1) correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that cse really cares how you do in physics.   2) just look this up on uw's website.   3) no.  Everyone who is in your position I have talked to regretted taking 125 since I've heard it's the most difficult of the 3. Just take 126, it's not as bad as people make it out to be (but it still sucks)  4) most people I know got in their sophomore year."
udub,3db7gz,misterpretzel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:05:44 2015 UTC,"3) I thought 126 was the hardest of the math classes. I took everything starting from 124 after learning up through 126 in high school, and the biggest issue was just that the classes were horribly boring and tedious. The review was nice to fill in the gaps, and I guess the easy GPA booster was good. 125 was slightly harder than 124 if anything. It definitely varies by teacher though, I got sort of a lucky streak through the math classes and ended up with all good teachers.  125 might be worth taking your first quarter just to boost your GPA. For CSE you pretty much need everything you can get to get your GPA as high as possible.  Also, it's pretty common for people to mess up their first quarter, and you don't want to spend that quarter taking the critical classes for the major. You're applying at the end of freshman year anyways, so you can wait until second or third quarter to take the really important classes."
udub,3db7gz,GrandmaJoe,3,Wed Jul 15 00:24:17 2015 UTC,Maybe I just had a better prof for 126... ahem Loveless ahem...
udub,3d7ouf,NoStopImDone,10,Tue Jul 14 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes enrolling in a FIG will help you get classes that usually fill up quickly. I got in to INFO 200 as a freshman because they reserve spots in the class for students taking a FIG. (to put this in perspective, INFO 200 is nearly impossible to get into, even as a sophomore)."
udub,3d7ouf,needmorespooce,7,Tue Jul 14 05:28:35 2015 UTC,I second this. Take the Info 200 + CSE 142 fig.
udub,3d7ouf,meniscus-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:33:02 2015 UTC,That's a FIG now? Damn that would have been nice several years ago..
udub,3d7ouf,wootz12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:53:06 2015 UTC,Yup
udub,3d7ouf,meniscus-,5,Wed Jul 15 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"I say that it might be worth it if you have no clue of what you want to major in. It's an easy way to just pick classes (if you don't have college credit already, I might add) and find concepts that you're interested in. But if you have an idea of what you want to get into, just pick classes that sound interesting, and don't waste your time."
udub,3d7ouf,Branamp13,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:25 2015 UTC,"it depends. I met a lot of my friends in my fig that i still hang out with, and that was 2 years ago."
udub,3d7ouf,TameNaken,2,Tue Jul 14 06:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, I regret not taking one for this reason."
udub,3d7ouf,ElTacoNaco,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I heard from other people that their FIGs were super quiet and no one really contacted each other after the first quarter ended. It really depends on the people there and which classes are the ones all of your will be taking together; mine's classes were very engineering-focused, so many of us had a lot in common."
udub,3d7ouf,wootz12,3,Wed Jul 15 11:55:48 2015 UTC,"No, I found it always conflicted with other possible classes that I wanted to take. Often times the leader is really self-absorbed or takes it too seriously. My GF didn't like hers, and all of my friends say they wish they hadn't done a FIG by about half way through the quarter."
udub,3d7ouf,AskMeAnyQuestion,3,Tue Jul 14 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't find mine worth it last year, the 2 credit fig became more of a hassle than anything as it felt pretty meaningless to both my education and my introduction to uw. Others had better experiences but there are a lot of places to make friends besides in a fig at uw."
udub,3d7ouf,xcbrendan,2,Tue Jul 14 13:30:38 2015 UTC,"I took a fig focused around tech. CSE 142, INFO 101 (just do info 200), and something else I forget. It was excellent to test some related things out. Makes it easy to choose classes, and I became friends with a few people in the fig and we have taken a bunch more classes together since we were all interested in the same topics and ended up going into the same major INFO!!!! If you are taking pretty much the classes you would take anyways, then it is really nice to have a set group of people who are taking those same classes and you are practically forced to communicate with. Branched out my network in the tech related field much quicker than I would have."
udub,3d7ouf,thothsscribe,2,Tue Jul 14 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"Would definitely say that it's a good way to meet people. You are with them for several (2 or more) classes, so in a big school, it's nice to see the same faces again and again for the first 10 weeks of your adjustment.   However!! If being in a FIG means conflicting with all your other classes that you want to take, don't do it. If all the FIGs are taken and you have an idea of what you want and it definitely isn't that, don't bother either. You may make friends, but it's far more likely that you'll enjoy yourself when everyone in the FIG has a common interest that you actually care about.   And oh, the actual context of the FIG/freshman seminar class is really no work at all, so if you're worried about adding on more academic stress, don't be fooled with that! Almost all leaders are super relaxed and will even bring in snacks and stuff for your meetings."
udub,3d7ouf,ohohomestuck,2,Tue Jul 14 10:01:37 2015 UTC,"It's really worth it if you are taking a non-standalone FIG. You meet the same people all the time and you'll have a great set of friends for the rest of your UW years, and hopefully beyond.  Standalone FIGs though are not worth your time."
udub,3d7ouf,meniscus-,2,Tue Jul 14 12:56:15 2015 UTC,"Depends, for me it was a total waste of time, I already had friends and knew what classes I was going to take. The counselor at the eop office signed me up for it when she was making my schedule, she highly recommended it so I said fuck it. I ended up completely regretting it, she also told me that I'd be fine taking 17 credits of science classes which ended up being awful as well haha."
udub,3d7ouf,Godawgsuw,3,Tue Jul 14 14:00:05 2015 UTC,Mostly good for making friends that will become close to for the rest of college ( or even more) . It helps ease you into the rigor of UW. I would definitely recommend.
