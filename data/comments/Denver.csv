Denver,3e2yvr,MurrayPloppins,8,Tue Jul 21 16:14:12 2015 UTC,The problem usually comes up when they want to dance and need both hands to swing.

Denver,3e2yvr,grapeormelon,6,Tue Jul 21 16:40:00 2015 UTC,Easy solution: polish of the drink and then dance. Have another while you take a break.
Denver,3e2yvr,troglodyte,19,Tue Jul 21 18:34:45 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that problem comes up when someone chooses to put something in someone's drink. That's not just a part of life like the weather.
Denver,3e2yvr,grapeormelon,14,Tue Jul 21 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, the person who commits the crime is responsible. I still lock my doors at night. Like it or not, you have to be prepared for that eventuality because people are assholes."
Denver,3e2yvr,troglodyte,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"Of course you do as do I but what happens when the locksmith is in on it too...and worse it's a violation of your body not just your stuff plus an already predisposed to demonize the victim crime. There is a lot of passed the line of ""common sense"" victim blaming in this thread. A lot of energy wasted not talking about the real issue and viable long term solutions for it cause the answer isn't holding on to your drink (that won't help you if its the bartender!) or color changing straws."
Denver,3e2yvr,grapeormelon,8,Tue Jul 21 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the whole thread, but there's a pretty firm line, in my opinion.  It's one thing to say ""you should protect your drink;"" it's another to say ""she passed out because she failed to cover her drink"" (or him, but date rapists are overwhelmingly male, so it's more commonly women). I'm as strongly in favor of the first as I am appalled by the second. Thankfully, I think most people that got upvoted were the former, not the latter."
Denver,3e2yvr,troglodyte,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:59 2015 UTC,Well good on you for calling out the only person that said the problem starts with the asshole putting something in people's drink....not how Fort Knox you can keep your beverage while at a bar.
Denver,3e2yvr,grapeormelon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I don't think that's the whole issue, and I think it's worth discussing both victim blaming and sound safety advice. I think it's insanely naive not to live like people are assholes, and there's a big difference between chiding people for good advice and chiding them for victim blaming.  It's very possible to be strongly opposed to victim blaming-- I think it's a horrible, insidious problem that affects women disproportionately-- and capable of agreeing with sound safety advice. I just happen to prefer that nuance, and I didn't happen to see anything on the other end of the spectrum to discuss in my cursory read of the thread.  (BTW I'm not the one downvoting you and I think whoever the fuck it is should stop, because it's a great point that spurred a reasonable discussion, and OBVIOUSLY the criminal is the one at fault)."
Denver,3e2yvr,PlattFish,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"This is the original comment you felt the need to remind me that people lock their doors. All I did was point out the problem doesn't start when someone leaves there drink to go dance. I don't understand why you're so bent after this. There is victim blaming all over this thread yes or no? Are you trying to show me the line you're comfortable with for someone to point that out? I'm sure you're a very reasonable person and I'm glad you hate victim blaming and I'm sure you have a comfort zone for bringing the topic up...but I have mine as well and you picked my comment to respond to when all I said was that leaving your drink out isn't where the problem starts. Have you read this whole thread yet? It didn't take long for the ""young women are just dumb animals"" comments to pop up or the stories of it happening to other people at the same bar. I'm not going to apologize for wanting to look at the bigger picture."
Denver,3e2yvr,Amsteah52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, do you actually have a solution to the bigger picture problem? It's way easier to convince girls to watch their drinks then to somehow hunt down date-rapists and convince them to stop. I'm all for societal change and combating date-rape culture or whatever, but that's not really a short term solution. People are gonna commit crimes, better to be on the defensive and be prepared, then focusing on allocating blame and hoping for the best."
Denver,3e2yvr,iamthetlc,6,Tue Jul 21 19:48:21 2015 UTC,So finish it then get a new one. Or leave it and get a new one. Your girls need to be more aware

Don't bother trying to convince me that young American women are responsible adults, it's a complete waste of your time. I've already put in my research and come to my own conclusions.  Also, when you use a sarcastic statement to try and humiliate someone for their ignorance, you should at least use a strong position or an exaggerated version of the original statement to highlight the absurdity of it, not simply restating the original comment in a sarcastic way.

Denver,3e2yvr,theenemee,4,Tue Jul 21 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I was at the Giggling Grizzly in the ballpark neighborhood and got drugged.  So did at least one of the dudes I was with. I was then robbed somewhere in rino/five points...don't remember six hours where I was apparently wandering around downtown black out.  This happened at like 8 on a Sunday evening too so it's not just when it's a club scene, never let your guard down and make my mistake!"
Denver,3e2yvr,theenemee,12,Tue Jul 21 19:49:34 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I blacked out after being at the cowboy lounge one night. We are 2 guys. He pocket dialed his mother while we were being jumped around 1:30/1:45am and that's how we found out about it all. She called him a couple days later. Apparently we fought the dude, some guy saw the whole thing and called the cops, the cops took the dude in and let us go. We have no memory of this. Also cowboy lounge smells like cheap whore and sweat. LoDo Bars in general are a bro bra co-bra fest. I am not a fan of the co-bra Kai. I do enjoy the P.U.N.C.H.I.S. Party upstairs at beta on Fridays from time to time though."
Denver,3e2yvr,K9ABX,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:17 2015 UTC,Point of this story is that we only had a couple and the same kind of thing happens to us. We went out late after work and did not have enough to drink for that to happen.
Denver,3e2yvr,theenemee,4,Tue Jul 21 17:34:24 2015 UTC,both having no memory at all must be somewhat alarming to you. A street brawl is something you'd think you would remember a bit about.

Denver,3e2yvr,katieispeachy,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"Products like that (I've seen nail polish that will change colors if your drink has been drugged) typically work for a pretty narrow range of date rape drugs, and there are many, many date rape drugs."

Denver,3dzfu0,coloradopowpow,15,Tue Jul 21 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"I have a theory as to why their food is mediocre at best and ""At least the sopapillas are wonderful"" at worst:  The cliffdivers.  From what I've seen, good hotels keep their restaurant on the far side of the building from their indoor pool.  I think that's because the chlorine of the pool would negatively affect the quality of the food.  The first thing I noticed when I entered, and it grew much more powerful near the cliffdivers area was the chlorine smell.  So maybe Casa Bonita doesn't serve a high quality food because they know that it's going take a hit from the chlorine that needs to be in the diving water?  Or maybe it's just a ""Meh, you're here for the atmosphere, not the cuisine"" attitude.  But it was a thought. :)"

Denver,3dzfu0,gfacer,6,Tue Jul 21 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"For those interested...  My fiancee worked as an actress for Casa Bonita for roughly a year. From what she's told me, this is as much inside track as I can give on the food situation:  The food is prepared  (believe it or not) fresh daily. However, the owner of Casa Bonita flat refuses to pay for high quality fresh ingrediants, so you end up with the discount veggies, canned chicken, and processed sauces that are all the people on the kitchen have to work with. Apparently the kitchen staff take great pride in their ability to get food edible under the circumstances.  For the person who mentioned the pool's ridiculous chlorine level: I shit you not, the water hasn't been changed in nearly 20 years due to the cost it would take to refill. The staff is constantly adding to the acidity levels just to try to get it reasonable, and my fiancee would have to come home and take multiple showers nightly just to wash off the chlorine and try to keep her hair/skin healthy. Also, picking her up...whooo, talk about smelling like the place... gross.  Anyways, she said that Casa Bonita truly had an awesome staff, the shows are generally performed by a tight knit group of kids who are genuinely happy to be there, they often write their own lines, craft the stories, make up puppet shows, are all all round good performers working for a cheapskate who won't spend the money making his restaurant better. Also, if you go on a free tour, they'll show you where Tray and Matt sat and worked on the South Park episode right in the restaurant.  I have heard that the owner is finally selling the place after owning since 1975, and the new company will be potentially taking down the he entire failed strip mall around the building to remake it into and whole entertainment...thing? Still in rumor phase, not sure about the legitimacy. But I recommend going to support the staff, the work really hard to make CB a fun time.  PS: Please never push the kid in the gorilla suit into the water. When it gets wet it weighs upwards of 500 pounds, and people have nearly died from drowning. Every staff member is required to go into the water near him to try to pull him back up. Pretty much ruins everyone's night."

Denver,3dzfu0,choppysmash,4,Tue Jul 21 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"There's only three scenarios in which I recommend going to Casa Bonita:   1) You're a child. Casa Bonita fits perfectly in that space between four and eleven where the ambiance is overwhelming and the palate is undeveloped.   2) You're a tourist or feeling nostalgic, in which you order the food because it's the price of admission. You drink a margarita or smoke a doob in the parking lot, go inside, suffer their food and reminisce for about an hour before realizing how depressing all the un-updated video games and disrepaired skeball machines (half of which don't work and just eat your tokens) and leave feeling just a little bit more cynical about childhood.  3) You have kids, so you're forced to make at least an annual trip to Casa Bonita, depending on how many of your kids friend's demand that their birthday take place there. You feel all the emotions of #2, but leavened with the fact that your child is running around having a blast and you can enjoy the experience vicariously through their eyes, turning into something bittersweet.  Casa Bonita pro-tip: order the chili rellenos, easily the most palatable dish on their menu. Don't order the all you can eat because you really aren't going to order another tray unless you're insane or obese."

I absolutely believe they are capable of basic, unprovoked destruction.  This just feels slightly off. I walked my dog three blocks in every direction looking for similar rocks in landscaping or construction and couldn't find any. This one had a lot of impact marks on it and looked pretty blackened, not your typical landscaping rock.  Plus the rock was just sitting on the shelf(?) behind the back seat. Just roughly guessing the angle of ""drunk guy throwing a rock,"" it seems like the rock should have ended up down in the seat itself somewhere, especially because the point of impact was pretty high up on the glass and it went through pretty cleanly.  My only non-drunk-guy theory is that it could have been kicked up by a trash truck or some other heavy equipment, but I don't think I'll ever know for certain. Luckily my cheap-ass insurance has full safety glass coverage, so I'll be getting a new one later today for nothing out of pocket."

I seriously never believed this was a meteorite, but y'all are a very literal bunch and I love you for it. A few people got very excited because there were actually some reports of meteor sightings recently, but the timing doesn't match up. My headline is wrong, it happened Saturday night/Sunday morning. It was such a bummer when I figured that out. Plus, it's not magnetic/I still have a back seat, so I can't even pretend to entertain the idea of it being a real space rock.

The exit--#128 (Last one before the tunnel) goes to the trailhead and nothing else.  The first half mile is uphill like going up stairs. After that it levels out, the sound of the freeway falls away and suddenly you are walking through a natural garden of wildflowers. Banks of columbines, fields of indian paintbrush, elephant heads, it goes on and on. There is a lake at the top, but the wildflowers are the attraction.  On the way down nice views down the valleys to the east.  Have fun, hikers."

Denver,3dyka6,cruisethevistas,25,Mon Jul 20 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the short sanitized version, without violating policy on what can and can't be said. The media has left a couple things out of the general narrative:   Mom sure didn't have a problem when police showed up. She wanted to assist in prosecution and said he needed to go to jail. This wasn't the first, second, or ninth time the suspect had ran FAR afoul of the law with serious charges.  Regardless if he stabbed her or not, he held a knife to her throat. That's still very serious.  When the suspect realized he ended up in a dead end he turned around and came toward the officers who issued several orders for him to stop, drop the knife etc. There was a child's birthday party in the trailer park. Those kids CHASED after the officers who were chasing the suspect. So when the suspect began to advance on the officers, they were stuck between an armed suspect and a group of small children in a rapidly evolving and volatile situation. The suspect screamed at the officers to shoot him several times, and then advanced on them. The officers waited until the last possible moment to take an action, hoping the suspect would stop or drop the knife. He was only feet from them when the shots were fired. When the suspect was advancing on the officers he had taken the knife from his own throat and was pointing it at the officers. The officers did not shoot a man threatening to kill himself, looking for help. Officers shot a man who had threatened his mothers life with a knife, was advancing with the knife held in a threatening manner on them and a large group of small children standing behind the officers. Was the suspect mentally ill? Perhaps. Is that the officers fault? Of course not. Would it have been great to get this guy help? Sure. Could he have gotten help after any of his dozens of arrests? Probably. Did the officers have any other options during those critical seconds they made their decision? None that I could see."
Denver,3dyka6,Dr_Facilier,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the mother should have realized when she called the cops, there was a good chance she was sentencing her son to death.  The police don't deal well with the violent mentally ill."
Denver,3dyka6,remarquian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"No. She didn't ""sentence her son to death"" and shouldn't have thought that at all.  She needed help. She called the police. That's what we do.  Everything that happened afterward rests on the suspect's shoulders.   He made a series of decisions that formed the final outcome. Not the mothers fault, not the police's fault."
Denver,3dyka6,Dr_Facilier,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"The truth is that if you call the police to help someone that is violently crazy, their chances of dying increase dramatically.    Even more so if they are male and/or a minority.  The training police have to deal with the violently crazy is to shoot them.  But your are right, it was his fault for being crazy."
Denver,3dyka6,remarquian,3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for adding some more context to what happened. There is an apparent bias on /r/Denver (and Reddit in general) that all cops are trigger happy assholes.

Denver,3dyka6,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"So you're saying EVERY single cop out there is trigger happy? Probably all of them, except the ones you know, right? Lol"
Denver,3dyka6,PrincessOfRainbows,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"My problem is not with the possibility of trigger happy cops...given a large enough group there is bound to be some bad apples and sociopaths.  Same goes for priests, teachers and other positions of authority, but for some reason we don't hold cops to the same standards when they abuse that position of authority.  My problem is that the law seems unable to enforce itself uniformly.  The penalty for a regular citizen murdering an unarmed person for dubious reasons is going to be far, far worse than if a cop does it, prosecuting attorneys aren't afraid of throwing regular people in jail, and coworkers aren't going to protect the murderer and interfere with evidence collection.  Add to this that cops have more than double the likelihood of being a domestic abuser in their home, and many PD's discriminating against high-IQ individuals and you have a recipe for disaster."
Denver,3dyka6,greenbuggy,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:42 2015 UTC,So you're saying EVERY single cop out there is trigger happy?   Every single cop will defend every single shooting with severely limited exceptions. The blue shield of silence ensures cops help each other to break the law consistently.
Denver,3dyka6,denversocialist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"That's not at all what I said. The police have shown over and over that when one of their own uses unjustified force, they do whatever it takes to protect that cop from consequences, no matter how badly he fucked up. Sometimes fatal shootings are justified. But in the many cases where it isn't justified, the cops always lie to protect their own. Having seen that countless times, it's impossible to trust a story the police give when they've shot someone."
Denver,3dyka6,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"If all of this were true, why haven't we seen the videos?"
Denver,3dyka6,RedditGTdigg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"Because police departments don't release video and other evidence during an investigation. That's not new or unique to Denver. Every credible department operates this way.   The Denver DA does something that I've never seen any other city do: they have a page on their site called the ""shoot letters"".   After the DA releases it's decision on an officer involved shooting, they publish a step by step account of the incident, their findings and all of the legal precedents they used to reach their findings.   If there is video, they release that too, a good example of that: the Ronquillo shooting last year."
Denver,3dyka6,Dr_Facilier,9,Tue Jul 21 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"I dont know when the policy shifted to just murdering people threatening to kill themselves, but holy fuck thats disgusting.

Denver,3dyka6,drax117,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"That’s when he realized he was trapped, turned around and headed back to the street with a knife to his neck. Police opened fire and he fell to the ground.   We don't know exactly what happened;  it's likely he was moving towards the officers with a knife to his neck. If you continue reading the article apparently an officer didn't fire until he was within 6 feet.   Take the above into the account, plus the fact that he was mentally unstable, and I can see the officer's action being justified. If the officer had continued to let the victim advance toward him, he might have turned the knife on the officer."
Denver,3dyka6,EnergyMonkey,6,Mon Jul 20 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"So....mace... Tazers... Non lethal rounds. I can think of a multitude of possibilities to enact in this situation. I agree with drax117... When did it become ok for cops to skip their escalation of force protocols and jump right to shooting at people? Given I don't know the whole story but I can't fathom any situation where I am a trained police officer in a stand off with an emotionally disturbed individual armed with a knife where my first option is to shoot them. Like seriously. Cops are specifically trained for instances like this and are given many non lethal options. Drawing down on a civilian should be a last option and it makes me fucking sick.... As soldier, as a proponet of the justice system, as a human being...fucking sick.  Tldr: next time a crazy guy walks toward you with a weapon... Mace, tase, whatever the person."
Denver,3dyka6,ninjames101,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"Given I don't know the whole story   Exactly. You're missing some key details here. I'll help you out. The suspect didn't have the knife pointed at his own throat. He had turned it toward the officers and was advancing on them. The officers had run out of room for retreat, because there was a gaggle of children behind the officers. They had CHASED the officers while they were chasing the suspect.  Frankly, the officers displayed cool thought and restraining by ensuring that the backdrop was clear (no children behind the suspect) and waiting for as long as possible before being forced to take action, by allowing him to close within 6'."
Denver,3dyka6,Dr_Facilier,7,Mon Jul 20 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"No. I'm saying nobody knows the whole story. We know what gets told to us. I'm telling you as somebody who has been in many of similar situations i got out of most with out killing somebody. What's worse is I was in a position where that was my actual job description...to kill people.... police officers are there to help not to end lives. They are not ""Judges"" but some of them act like it"
Denver,3dyka6,ninjames101,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:11:50 2015 UTC,"And I'm telling you that those are the things that happened.   The officers acted exactly as they were trained. They weren't being judges or executioners. They had run out of options and did what they had to, not what they wanted to."
Denver,3dyka6,Dr_Facilier,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"You're telling me they had absolutely zero non lethal options? When was the last time you saw a cop with out a tazer... Or mace? Further, as police officers, you are trained marksmen... Youre telling me a six feet away... At seventy two inches away you can't aim for top right of shoulder? Outside of the thy? The foot?

I'm telling you that what you're asking is unreasonable.   What you're asking for is not reasonable to expect out of any trained professional under and amount of real world stress. It's been shown to not work.   And if those shots were to connect,  they've been shown to be unreliable threat stoppers. All credible up to date training trains for center of mass shots.   Taser? OC spray? Not appropriate at that distance, because of the probability and consequences of failing to stop the threat.   No one trains that way, and for good reason: it doesn't work.

Denver,3dyka6,Manburpigx,-7,Tue Jul 21 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"They would want to get the knife away from him. If he won't out the knife down, they must do it themselves. Tazer could work but if ineffective then he slices his own throat of still has a knife. Try to take it with your bare hands and he will kill himself or turn the knife in officers. Shooting is the only sure way to get the knife away if he won't cooperate.  If she didn't call the cops he still could've sliced his throat and no one would be there to stop bleeding which would only even be possible if it wasnt arterial bleeding.  Calling the cops was the only real chance the guy had. She regrets it because she blames cops for the death. If he would've been cooperative or not suicidal then he would be alive. It's a coping mechanism of grief to blame someone other than the deceased."
Denver,3dyka6,g_mo821,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"A police officer's job is not to take ""the only sure way"".

It's called morals, principles, and standards, the immaterial things that make good people good and the lack of which makes bad people bad.  If a cop only does what he is legally required to do and then makes personal exceptions and deals as he wishes in the cracks, he is a bad and corrupt cop."

(hypothetical situation here)   First of all, you might have the right to call the police, but you absolutely do not have the right to restrain them yourself- there is nothing illegal about having a gun, even if you're open carrying. Maybe in some extreme hypothetical situation someone should call some sort of authority, but if this incident teaches anything, it's that the bar for that situation ought to be way higher (if you don't want to risk lethal engagement by a militarized police force)."
Denver,3dyka6,denversocialist,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"Is there ever an attempt to disarm anymore?  Like, couldn't they have shot him in the leg?  I am by no means an expert marksman but I have shot my fair share of rounds at the ranges.  If he was 6 feet away, a leg shot seems pretty damn easy.  When did it become the norm to just go ahead and shoot to kill because a weapon is present?  I have much respect for cops. I really do, but it seems like we can do better here."
Denver,3dyka6,bassmansrc,10,Mon Jul 20 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"Police aren't trained to shoot for extremities. There's too much danger in it for them and that doesn't outweigh the potential benefit. In the heat of the moment, even from a few feet, Police have to be able to hit what they are shooting at and so aiming for the center mass is always going to be where they shoot for.   As the article said, ""But shooting experts say police would have been justified in pulling the trigger if Castaway was within 21 feet of an officer. Studies show officers can be stabbed within that distance. Castaway was within 6 feet.""  I would have to watch the security footage to know for a fact but the article makes it sounds as though the man ran away, hit a dead end, and came running back around to find the police. It happened quick, it sounds like. Yes, he had the knife to his own throat but things unfolded quickly and the Police found this guy WELL INSIDE their danger zone. It a surprise they fired their weapons?   In any case, I hope this event gets a fair and comprehensive review and investigation."
Denver,3dyka6,Fofolito,7,Mon Jul 20 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, I get that the guy with the knife was within their danger zone. Judging by the information known, I don't believe the cops will be found to have committed any crime.  That's fine.    But to me, that's not what is at issue.  We have gotten to a place where we want things to be so black and white.  As though there can only be two options - Either 1. the cops commit murder or 2. the cops justly defend themselves  I am saying that we should start exploring those possibilities in the middle...where the lines might not be so sharp.  This guy had a knife to his own throat.  The cops are armed with guns and most likely wearing some sort of armor (under vest at least).  Yes, he's within 21 feet with a weapon so he is technically a threat.  But could he be disarmed without deadly force?  Let's be honest, he probably could have been.  But that doesn't seem to be the standard we are looking for anymore.  To me that is sad."
Denver,3dyka6,bassmansrc,0,Mon Jul 20 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on almost all of it and I'm sure like most people I think police should be wearing cameras to be able to see the event through the cop's eyes but if someone is running at you holding a knife chances are almost anyone would view that as a life threatening threat.  True, it said he was holding the knife to his own neck but it doesn't take very much to be from his neck to the officer's neck.  Sadly I don't believe the middle areas you are looking for will ever be fully hashed out, at that point everything is situational based and you can't write rules that cover every situation, there's too much of that middle area you speak of.  I think police in this city get away with a sickening amount but I don't think this is really one of those situations, just a fucked up situation that went sideways.  Holding a knife while charging at someone who has a gun? Probably not going to end well.  I understand why he got shot and am more sad at the situation than mad with the police here."
Denver,3dyka6,cotrees,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"I understand why he got shot and am more sad at the situation than mad with the police here.   Yep, and I didn't really make it clear before but I completely agree with this.  Sad indeed."

Denver,3dyka6,cotrees,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"Like, couldn't they have shot him in the leg? I am by no means an expert marksman but I have shot my fair share of rounds at the ranges. If he was 6 feet away, a leg shot seems pretty damn easy.   No.  Not only is it a bad idea, it's dangerous.  There are really just 4 cardinal rules of gun safety.     1. Treat every firearm as if it's loaded.  2. Never point a firearm at anything you are not willing to destroy.  3. Always be sure of your target and what is beyond it.  4. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are on target and ready to fire.    Aiming for an extremity breaks rule 2 and rule 3.  If you aim for an arm (especially in a small alleyway setting like this one), you risk missing your target, and having the bullet go into a home and kill an innocent bystander.  If you aim for a leg and miss, the bullet can ricochet off the ground, go into a nearby home, and kill an innocent bystander.  If you have someone with a knife coming at you and he's less than 6 feet away (the length of your arm from fingertip to fingertip), I believe that gives him the right to shoot with the intent to dispatch the threat to his life.  I don't know every nuance of the story, and I don't want to rush to judgement until I know exactly what happened, but going by the information that is given in the news article, I believe the officer made the correct decision.  In the words of the mother, ""He was drunk. I told the cops he was mentally ill. He was schizophrenic. I called for help.""  I'm sorry her son died, perhaps the officer was in the right here.  But I could be wrong."
Denver,3dyka6,SaudiAurora,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had not thought through the idea of shooting for the arms or legs.  I guess that's cheesy Hollywood ideals sinking in.   It makes perfect sense that police would have a policy to not do that.  I just have trouble getting past the idea (based solely on what we know), that there wasn't a better way to handle this that wouldn't of resulted in death.  Based on the info provided, I'm not suggesting that the cops did anything illegal or ""wrong"" (in the policy sense).  I am more thinking that it just seems like we have gotten to a place where when there is a present danger, police are encouraged to shoot first and sort it out later. I would love to see a policy that encourages more thoughtful risk assessment and prioritizes disarmament.  I also understand that this opinion is reactionary and not based in any kind of data."
Denver,3dyka6,bassmansrc,0,Mon Jul 20 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well, consider why they are trained to shoot.  It's because they don't have any other options, and their lives are at risk.  At 6 feet, a knife  will beat an undrawn pistol by far.  Even drawn it takes an average of 6 shots to the chest before someone dies.  How long does it take you to lunge 6 feet with a knife?  Unless you're trained, you likely won't hit him enough to put him down before he's on you.  After he's on you, you're going to get stabbed many, many times, and the chances of wrestling your gun in the right direction and pulling the trigger into anything that will stop the stabbing is pretty low.  Wrestling a gun is much, much easier than wrestling a knife.  If he wasn't armed with a knife, they could have tried non-lethal options.  But I would never ask a police officer to bring a taser, or mace, or any less than lethal weapon to a knife fight.  For their own safety they need to have the upper hand force-wise.  It's a shitty situation.  This is of course, not counting those situations of obvious police brutality.  This is assuming the police aren't the same type in the recent brutality occurrences."

Denver,3dyka6,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"Some of the comments in this thread are why so many /r/Denver posters are worthy of nothing but mockery.   About 9 years back, I threatened suicide as well heavily intoxicated after I had called a friends mom, who in turn called the Denver PD. Two female officers showed up and talked me down and got me to detox and family.  But as long as a lot of you get to make bullshit excuses that this was just a-ok.  Oh, and the two cops that came for me never even pulled their pistols from their holsters. And I could have gotten violent.  So yea, there are ways to talk someone down."
Denver,3dyka6,Krona74,7,Mon Jul 20 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"""Could have gotten violent"" is not nearly the same thing as actively being violent.  Talking works with some people, others it doesn't. When someone is charging at you with a weapon, that is not the time to say hey lets just relax and talk this out.  People asking what they can't just shoot a leg... Just displays to everyone that you have no idea how violent situations work. There is a difference between a lethal shot and an incapacitating shot. Police are trained to take the incapacitating shot. Sometimes that's lethal. Shooting someone in the leg is neither incapacitating nor lethal.  Could the police in this situation have done something different? Maybe. Could they have used a TASER? Maybe. Baton? Maybe. We went there.  I've personally seen all these tools work well and fail miserably. The taser is great, when it works. The baton works really well except for when it doesn't."
Denver,3dyka6,refboy4,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:36 2015 UTC,There is a really big hole in the emergency response system in my opinion. This kind of problem is not one that can or should be solved by the police or paramedics.   It seems like there should be a psychological response team that 911 should send. I know this doesn't exist but maybe one should be designed.

This won't do you any good if you're coming at someone with a knife in your hand, but if you get tackled and handcuffed instead of shot, then the EMTs have a better chance of identifying what's wrong with you, and treating you properly."
Denver,3dyka6,SaudiAurora,-7,Mon Jul 20 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"According to reports, the man who was shot was within 6 feet from the officers. I'm not one to justify if that makes it okay to shoot someone with a knife, but for fucks sake, rapid fire? I would think a trained police officer would be able to lay down one accurate shot to the leg or something to immobilize the person coming toward them."
Denver,3dyka6,brigar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not anti-cop or pro-cop, but just want to provide my opinion:  Police are trained to shoot until the threat has been stopped, and trained to shoot center mass. Shooting at extremities is dangerous for police and bystanders. Shooting to kill is pretty brutal but there is some 'science' to it. Not everyone stops immediately when they have been shot. The fact that the guy had a weapon and was so close is pretty much all they needed to justify it. At the end of the day, the police want to go home safely, and figure that the guy with the weapon was going to kill them.  As for the 6 feet away comment, here is some info on the '21-foot rule' commonly used by police and self-defense training:   http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Tueller/How.Close.htm http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/duel-dilemmas/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tueller_Drill"

They have no obligation to put the citizens safety above their own, and so they don't.  However, that is a shitty way to volunteer to serve and protect the community, if you put yourself first you're not serving them you're just enforcing them... borderline oppressing them.  They don't CARE about the citizenry, they just enforce law upon the citizenry, and that is a dark road to go down."

Denver,3dyka6,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,0,Tue Jul 21 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of ""want"". It's a matter of practicality. You can wish for a police department full of Jason Bournes, who can shoot guns out of people's hands at any range - I certainly do - but frankly it's unrealistic.   The research has shown it time and again. It's not realistic to expect a person, trained or not, to be able to hit a small moving target under stress when they believe their or someone else's life is being endangered. Hitting a leg/thigh/arm at 6' when it's moving is a low percentage shot.  Officers aren't shooting at center of mass because it's the easy way to clean up the call and be home by dinner. They do it that way because every real-world based, cutting edge training program teaches exactly that, because it's been shown to work; and the latter has been shown to fail - over and over again."

Denver,3duyqe,CoGa,14,Sun Jul 19 19:15:39 2015 UTC,Chinns Lake. Took my jeep offroading late at night (we had late start) and we settled on this spot around 11.  Stars were Unbelievable up there.  Can't wait to go back.   Coolest part was knowing it was an epic spot but not knowing what it looked like until we woke up and were greeted by this
Denver,3duyqe,STR2,8,Sun Jul 19 19:21:02 2015 UTC,I was up there last weekend. The Stars were amazing. http://i.imgur.com/Iw2koC7h.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/TBsYpwGh.jpg. We stayed up right where the two lakes meet at the stream/waterfalls.

Doing a little reading, it sounds like this might be a true 4WD road in some places - in your opinion is it doable in an AWD (Forester)? Or is it a little more more intense than my Subi can handle?"
Denver,3duyqe,riomx,3,Sun Jul 19 20:27:57 2015 UTC,I saw a forester go all the way to the top last weekend. Definitely doable but just take it slow through the water crossings and big rocks.
Denver,3duyqe,CoGa,2,Mon Jul 20 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"Been watching some videos on YouTube. Looks like it's doable, but there are quite a few jagged rocks that could cause some nasty damage if not careful.  My wife still want to check it out, though, and see how far we can get up safely. We have a 2007 Forester."

If I remember correctly we walked by Saturday morning and a girl in your group was wearing a purple Philadelphia shirt. Were you guys the one shooting the gun, or was that the people next to you?  Spot I took from the same spot: http://imgur.com/7DD3zPR"
Denver,3duyqe,treefrog25,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely the same night. But I was wth my buddy, not my gf this time. I was in a silver 4 door wrangler if you saw me leave in the morning? Those dudes shooting late at night pissed me off so much!"
Denver,3duyqe,AnhydrousEtOH,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"Yea I was somewhat hoping you were the dude with the gun so I could blow off a little steam. Not only did they shoot late at night WAYYY too close to other camp sites, but he following morning we were sitting around the edge of the upper lake and the jackass was just shooting aimlessly across the lake. I would have gone and said something to the guy but clearly he was holding a gun and likely wasn't too bright given his actions. Wasn't it not too far from there that someone was just recently killed by a stray bullet?  Would have loved to see those guys get a ticket. They were putting our whole group on edge (aside form just being obnoxious).   Were you guys cutting would real late? If so we felt bad. We wanted to give ya some but had to save the little we had left for breakfast. Our friends had been working on a tree up near where we heard the chopping come from, but hey gave up on it before finishing."
Denver,3duyqe,Jackalopecia,2,Sun Jul 19 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Yup that was us haha. I actually brought a bundle of wood then my buddy cut a few logs up too, he wanted to get a workout in anyways :)  Hope I didn't disturb you guys showing up that late   We were a bit freaked out from the shooting, and you saying they shot across the lake is pretty messed up, we were camping over there! At one point we added paper and lighter fluid to the fire; making sure everyone knew we were there!"
Denver,3duyqe,InCraZPen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Nah. Didn't disturb us, but we felt bad you guys were having to cut wood that late. We could see your camp fire up on the hill from our spot, so that was a smart move. It actually looked really cool reflecting off the still lake.  I'm looking forward to heading up there again sometime, unfortunately I'm dependent on others as my car can't make it the whole way up there."
Denver,3duyqe,SmellyMickey,4,Mon Jul 20 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"If you get their license plate, report them to the rangers. Shooting across a body of water is very illegal.

Denver,3duyqe,FATTYDICKA,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"I've not been, but traildamage.com is usually pretty good at describing 4x4 roads. And they rate it as a 2/10 for difficulty. They also describe the road as follows:   The beginning of the trail is a mellow, dirt road...  ...This portion of the trail can be a bit rough because it can get a little steep in places. There is one switchback that could cause some SUVs some issues...  ...Continue past Chinns Lake and the road is slightly washed out in places. This may make things a bit more difficult.   So it sounds like it should be ok for most of it. It also sounds like there are plenty of good campsites below the lake if you can't make it past the rougher spots."

There might not have been enough probable cause to take him in.  But the police have a record of multiple complaints about the situation, so they might take an occasional drive down your block for a little while.  Since the girl now knows what's been happening, go introduce yourself to her, and then talk to a few of your neighbors and let them know what's been going on.

Denver,3dv6ue,WinterMatt,4,Sun Jul 19 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Matt!  Thanks a ton for the compliment, I appreciate it greatly!  To answer you and /u/thechubby1 's questions below, it's a DJI Phantom 3.  You can view a lot of details on it's Amazon page here: http://amzn.com/B00VSITBJO  The camera comes with the drone, and it's a great camera.  You can shoot either 4k video at 30fps, or 1080p at 60fps.  I tend to shoot at 1080p/60fps, as I find it's easier to do a slo-mo thing afterwards if you need it.  Plus, Youtube doesn't do 4k video, so it seems kinda extraneous to film in that mode.  Still, the quality is pretty great, and I'm particularly impressed with the night shooting, such as in my Elitches Fireworks video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjisojkpjGA"
Denver,3dv6ue,tarantulae,2,Sun Jul 19 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"Great looking video! As a helicopter pilot, I just want to say thanks for keeping your flight relatively low. From whats in this video it looks like you didn't go above 100 maybe 150 feet. We really appreciate it as drones can be a serious hazard for us.  Just as an FYI: There are TFRs (temporary flight restrictions) that cover sloan's lake every time there is a rockies game. From 1 hour before to 1 hour after. Surface to 3000' AGL. I don't think they will penalize you for flying in that time (unless you have an actual pilots license) but I would avoid it if you can. Example"

Denver,3dyval,PrincessOfRainbows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:27 2015 UTC,I would write down your current address and provide the name contact info of the Landlord - assuming she won't give you a bad reference because basically I think they are wanting to probably call and just make sure you're not going to be a problem for  them. As for the status of your lease just write N/A  and if/when you're asked about the N/A just explain it as you've done here.   OR   Just call the property manager you're filling the application out for and explain it to them as you've done here and ask how they want you to fill it out.

Denver,3drj58,WickedCunnin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"There are two types of PMI, BPMI and LPMI.  LPMI is deductable, causes your interest rate to go up slightly on the loan basis, and lasts the lifetime of the loan.  It becomes a part of the mortgage and is carried by the lender.  BPMI is not deductible, does not affect the basis of your loan, and generally falls off after 20% (you 22%).  This can last about 5 to 6 years with a 10% down payment.  You have BPMI.  The other poster is describing LPMI.  B = borrower L = lender.  Each has their own benefit and drawback and should be calculated on a spreadsheet.  Also, LPMI benefit relies on the fed keeping mortgage interest deductible in the future but it has been that way about 75 years so it is unlikely but not impossible that could change in the future which would make LPMI very unattractive if that happened."

You don't need genius level intelligence for a STEM degree. It can certainly help, but the effort and dedication put into learning is what really matters.  It can certainly be more difficult for those with no emotional or financial support, but this does not make it impossible; simply a test of willpower.  A formal college education isn't even necessary in all cases. There is a wealth of information available on the internet, often for free. Though a degree does give one much more credibility.  I believe that self-awareness plays a big role here. If you struggle with something, do not simply concede that it is impossible. Instead, analyze your actions and efforts and consider how you might adjust them to further your progress.   Where there is a will, there is a way."

Denver,3drj58,OobaDooj,7,Sun Jul 19 05:04:48 2015 UTC,I doubt people are splitting the down payment on a mortgage with roommates. That seems like it would be a terrible idea.

Denver,3drj58,yeradolt,16,Sat Jul 18 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"No, I meant exactly like you described.  Save up your own down payment, rent rooms, and apply it to your equity.  It's how I got my first one when I was younger."
Denver,3drj58,OobaDooj,4,Sat Jul 18 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm doing right now. I bought a house in 2013 for a low payment, and have two roommates who are paying the entire mortgage."

Denver,3drj58,black_pepper,20,Sat Jul 18 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to save up your money and wait until the market corrects itself   People have been saying this for over 10 years now. They can wait for there to possibly not be that much of a housing shortage. The only effect that will have is it won't be so hard to buy a house and there will be far less bidding wars. The effect it would have on price values would be negligible.  I would say if you are in a position to buy a house to not wait. Things won't change much any time soon. Go in with a level head and be persistent. Check listings constantly, don't fall in love with a house, and don't get into bidding wars. Stay in it for the long haul and you might get lucky. I got my house on sheer luck after 8 months of constant searching."
Denver,3drj58,Mmiranda51,11,Sat Jul 18 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Less bidding wars = lower prices. I bought my house in March 2012 near sloans  for ~130k with 20% down.

For a 30 year loan, you will reach the doubling time at about 17 years. For 5%, you reach it at 14 years, for 6%, about 12. There are better ways to calculate interest costs, but I like this on because it's easy to calculate and compare. It doesn't mean your loan will actually double, because you'll be paying it down, but some of it will cost you twice what you borrowed, or four times, or eight, etc."
Denver,3drj58,thatgeekinit,0,Sat Jul 18 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well, but our housing and financial policies very much favor allowing cash buyers and large real estate holding entities to push up the prices further at the same time as stock is low in pretty much any city people want/need to live in for good jobs."
Denver,3drj58,Jackalopecia,7,Tue Jul 21 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is the truth and, as much as it pains homeowners, it will happen.  The median selling price of a home in Denver in about eight times median income. Historically, that is an unsustainable rate. When most people in the city earn under $50k for their whole household, ""starter"" 400k homes that require mom and dad to help out looks like bullshit - and eventually there won't be enough dollars to chase these overpriced homes.  As a side note, I earn far more than that and still am so tired of hearing how young peole ""bought"" their home and talk about bootstraps and hard work when a massive gift from Daddy was the only way they were getting a loan."
Denver,3drj58,MiniTab,4,Sat Jul 18 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  My wife and I have a household income of about $125k right now.  However, because of a foreclosure she went through during the last crash (in FL), everything is in my name.  I make about $70k (and on track to make significantly more), excellent credit, and am approved for a $300k mortgage.  The payment that goes along with that (including PMI, because I sure as hell don't have $60k in cash) is close to $2,000/mo.  That is close to half my monthly take home salary.    That is just insane that people are being approved for mortgages that would eat up half their monthly income.  In our case, we could afford it as my wife also makes $55k.  But the fact that I am approved for such financial madness tells me that we are going down the same path again that we did a few years ago.    So while we could afford to buy something in Denver right now, we are absolutely not.  You really would have to be a complete moron to buy in this market right now, considering the high debt/income that people are getting into now (and as you pointed out)."
Denver,3drj58,Jackalopecia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Well said. And to think that you alone have a considerably better-than-median wage for the Denver area, and yet a home LESS than the MEDIAN (not average!) sale price is completely unaffordable for you.  That is unsustainable and I've not had anyone in this sub, cheering for higher home prices in perpetuity, explain to me how ever-increwsing home values gel with stagnant wages."

Denver,3drj58,thehappyheathen,10,Mon Jul 20 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"This thread really highlights the issues with inequality and stagnant wages that have effected the younger generation. I mean the top answers are live with roommates, get married but don't start a family by having kids, and rely on money from your parents. Further down the list you have a few people who got lucky after a modest rebound in housing prices since the collapse helped them create some wealth.   You'll notice work hard and save your money isn't suggested anywhere. That used to be the way to achieve the American dream but those days seem to have faded into history."
Denver,3drj58,snoreee,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"Wages aren't what they used to be. In the '80's, my parents worked as a carpenter and a public school teacher and we had it pretty good (until they divorced). My dad would take months off between jobs and my mom spent the summers with us. They even had money to send me and my brothers to guitar lessons or gymnastics.  I have trouble imagining that two people in those same professions today could afford to own a home, have two decent cars and spend that much time with their kids. Of all the things I'd like to change about America, the one that seems the most unjust is that lower income people can't afford to be that kind of parent."

I do know one of my loan officers targets young, first time home buyers, and she has between 20-30 pre-approvals sitting around at any point in time because they keep getting outbid on the homes they want and are kept waiting for one to bite.

I really wish we weren't associated with the sales people. Most of them are numbnuts who just harass the actual IT people, and often have zero actual IT/tech experience. Mostly they make bank by selling the moon to managers who don't know any better and don't listen to their technical staff. It's commonly dishonest and not at all tech related.  Not to mention if the money is in sales, call it what it is. Right now there's a lot of animosity toward tech because of the recent economic situation. It sucks.

Strong background in AD and Windows server (2003 - 2012) and Exchange (2003, 2010), o365 support, all Windows, some VMWare (predominantly vSphere, VMWare View, a bit of vCenter), a bit of Hyper-V but nothing I'd add to my resume, lots of support in varying environments (finance, medical, non-profit, etc.) with environment specific software products, etc. Also, some basic programming (have written a few scrapers in Python, and am currently learning Java).  So no particular specialization to speak of. My last job was at a MSP and I got to work with a bit of everything. Currently underutilized in an enterprise site support role as sole site support in the finance sector. It's dull at times and doesn't challenge me at all. I'm starting to feel like some of my skills are rusting over, particularly the virtualization stuff, which is frustrating. But it's stable and pays more than the MSP did. More importantly, there's enough downtime off and on for me to study programming, as development is what I'd like to be doing in the future.

Houses in Denver are very expensive, Thornton and other suburbs are cheaper and honestly, safer.  I plan to buy a house even though I know it's a bad economy. The reason I can is because I won't really be buying it, my dad in law is using his veteran's benefits to buy a house with a mortgage $800 - $1000 and we'll rent the basement to friends for $650. So then we pay barely anything besides all the regular bills. Beats $1200 for a one bedroom apartment, $500 pet deposit, $600+ security deposit. Renting in Colorado is so expensive."

Then I had to transfer to Texas just last month and sold the place for $320K. Sold in one day and first offer was $25k over asking. Not a bad investment, even if I didn't want to move.   tl:dr Sell your soul to Satan and you can have stuff."
Denver,3drj58,FootballBat,6,Sun Jul 19 02:54:41 2015 UTC,"I bought my place this spring, right before the demand blew up again this summer. There are a lot of factors in the search. First, location. When I was looking, very few houses were on the market for more than a day or two in Chafee Park and Park Hill, but they were the most desirable under 350k. There was plenty of inventory in the south Federal area that wss affordable. Popular neighborhoods like Cap Hill and LoHi just don't have detached single family homes for less than 500k. Secondly, there are plenty of options for couples to get loans with cheaper down payments at low interest; money is super cheap right now still, and there are first time homebuyer options on top of that. Finally, a TON of houses go before they are even on the MLS. A good realtor is essential, especially since the seller pays! Thanks to those factors, I ended up in a place in a growth area, for a reasonable price, with a very good interest rate, for under just under 300k, and I bought totally solo. It was a lot of work to get it done and it frequently felt like it wasn't going to come together, but ultimately it happened very quickly (put in an offer on the same day I saw the place, accepted two days later, my offer won out of seven that were received in two days thanks to my realtor KICKING ASS at his job).  If you're serious, look seriously and be prepared to move quickly. Get prequalified before you look. Know what your limits are. Understand what is essential to you in an offer and what's not and be prepared to make sacrifices in building your offer to help the seller feel confident you'll close. Get a realtor who knows the city and wants to win deals badly. Decide quickly. Reasonably priced homes go fast in this city.  Oh, and don't use Zillow. Redfin is slightly better, but both are hilariously slow at picking up changes in the MLS. REColorado is the actual public front end for the Colorado MLS and updates minutes after a home is listed. Zillow took so long to update that I'd closed by the time it listed my house!"

And the market did correct itself: those houses now are north of $900k. Same thing in DC. It's a toss-up, but I can tell you now that this does not feel the same as the bubble in ~2004-2005 when I bought my first house. Back then there was not shortage of apartments and other options for housing but the home prices kept going up independent of supply — normal economic drivers were not playing, resulting in the bubble; Denver is following a demand curve with lagging supply."

We bough in the Sloans Lake area and settled for a 2-bedroom townhouse with a tiny yard. Sure, we would have liked to buy a single-family home in Uptown but we couldn't afford a $500K house either."

Updated it all by myself only spending money on materials(the $8k new home buyers credit at the time took care of all of that). Then I sold it for $160k in 2012 when prices were just starting to climb and interest rates were still good. Put $10k of the profits for the first home down as 3.5% on a $245k home with an FHA mortgage again. Fast forward to 2015, prices are way up but rates are still down and I refinanced into a conventional loan to drop PMI as the home I bought for $245k less than 3 years ago appraised for just under $400k. That's how I ended up owning a nice home at a reasonable price at age 29. How do most people do it?? Family money like most on here say! That or a much higher income than I have."

My husband and I bought our home in Denver just under 3 years ago (when were were 25), when rates and prices were much more reasonable. We didn't have a large income, had lots of student loan debt, and only had the bare minimum 3.5% saved for the down payment - but we managed to find a home in our budget. We recently refinanced to get rid of the $280/month of mortgage insurance and our house appraised for 100k more than we bought it for 3 years ago. I think it would be almost impossible for us to qualify for a home in our neighborhood if we were buying right now."

It needs a new kitchen, but I got it $40k under market value. Buying foreclosed homes from HUD is a good idea in this market, because investors can't bid. I lost many other homes to investor cash offers. I also spent several months hunting and putting in a lot of offers.  You have to accept you may get a smaller or less new home. Then you can build up down payment and get a nicer home. People hate condos/townhomes, but they are a great way to get into the market.  Also renting out rooms.

They obviously needed renovations/updating but were in livable shape and in the right areas. 2-3 bedroom condos go 200-275k, houses start at 200k+ from anywhere  between Lakewood and Glendale, and any house downtown even in terrible condition goes 1 bedroom for 250k up to 3 bedroom for 350k and 4+ start at $450k."

We put 5% down (we saved like crazy the first year we were married) and ate the PMI hoping the house would appreciate and value and we could eventually get rid of it.  Fast forward 2 years, our home is valued at $480,000 and we were able to get rid of PMI based on a recent appraisal. My wife no longer works and we have twin babies with a household income of $105,000. Our mortgage payment is $2,000 (including Escrow) a month, which is tight but very doable for us and the home is big enough for us to live in for 10+ years.  In terms of advice, I definitely fall into the ""don't wait for a collapse because it might not happen"" crowd. There is big money investing in real estate in Colorado, which I believe to be a sign of confidence from real estate experts in the housing market in Denver.

That means you need to be making at least 70k to be safe. 70k is not a normal wage. The median per capita wage in Denver is about 52k which mean more than 50% of the population makes LESS than 52k. As you can imagine, even more people make less than 70k.  These homes seem pretty unaffordable for most people, so it is odd that young people 3-4 years into a career seem to be affording them. I can absolutely see someone buying a 200k house at that point, but the home prices seem too high for what's going on."

Denver,3drj58,Duckbilling,0,Sat Jul 18 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"Having a career doesn't magically endow one with cash and/or smarts. To buy a 500k house on a more average starting salary you either have to put up a smaller down payment, take a higher interest rate, and/or have a major gift from a family member.  Putting up a smaller downpayment isn't necessarily an intelligent thing, especially if combined with a higher interest rate. It might get the job done, at least initially, but in the long run will almost certainly not put them ahead; if anything it may put them behind people who wait a few years (assuming the market eventually plateaus).  Edit: There are places listing well under 300, some even under 200, but the question was specifically 500k. If you are looking for a starter home, going lower is better as long as there aren't $$$ in repairs looming :S. Financially speaking you can rebuild a savings for a bit while living in it, then move to a 'better' house and rent out the other, at least in the current market. Or turn around and sell it in a few years if it appreciates, and use the difference to boost you into the level where you want to be."

Edit: and have everything go right--no major setbacks, layoffs, retraining periods, medical setbacks, investments that collapse, etc. It certainly can be done as is your case, but there is a big factor of luck along with having all the ducks ready to go. It doesn't ""just happen through formula x"". Not trying to diminish your accomplishiment--it is huge regardless, but it's not simply that basic/simple on the average. You were fortunate to land in a good position and not face any major financial setbacks, but that is the exception, not the rule. That's all I'm saying :)."

No down payment sounds great, but I know too well the cost of interest...student loans don't help the debt:income ratio either.

Denver,3drj58,fatherdeath,0,Sat Jul 18 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"I've been looking lately and talking to a lot of bankers and real estate agents. It seems that most non-wealthy people who are buying a house these days are getting very risky loans. I hear that monthly mortgage payments up to 40% of the buyer's monthly income is quite common here these days. In addition, the market is so hot that you need to offer 20% ABOVE listing price and have at least 6% cash down payment; and a very high portion of the listed houses have been recently flipped and the prices are accordingly bloated. Lots of houses don't even get listed because the flippers know the agents and they have mountains of cash.   TLDR: Don't be one of those morons who is buying houses in Denver right now, unless you're already filthy rich and you don't care about wasting loads of money."

You can find studios as low as $800/month and 1 bedrooms not much more than that.   I don't know about your bill situation but 35k seems reasonable for here. I make much less than that and have around $500/month in bills (not including gas, groceries, and spending money). I also go out only every once in awhile. I enjoy alcohol but drink at home mostly. Cook most of my food but love eating out every two weeks or so. I don't have a ton of money for clothes, new gadgets etc. but meh. I can do this for a few years until I make more.   That's just me though. But if you want to stay here you should look at scaling back your expenses maybe? It could be helpful. It's definitely is easier said than done though. Especially if you're used to a certain way of life. I gave up all monthly things that aren't necessary (except Spotify - that pays for itself), like the gym (exercise at home or outside!), dating services, monthly delivery of random things, etc.   Hope you find a place that works for you or you figure it out to stay here.

I don't expect to find anything less than $700/800 a month when I have a roommate even. It's a compromise, not one that I love, but I've gotten lucky that a friend is moving back here so I can live with her so I'm not with a suspect Craigslist person.

I just looked at a place that was in a bad part of Aurora was 200 something square feet smaller than a hotel room and they wanted 800 bucks for it. the place I live now near Glendale is $620 and its 445 square feet... that's doable but their increasing the rent to $950. Our wages have not gone up so how can I do this I really do not want to spend more than half of my income on rent. I'm a blue collar house painter and a music teacher, I made less than $26,000 last year, most places want proof that you made four times as much money than the full lease. Getting a roommate is very difficult I have a golden retriever that I love and will never give up makes roommates difficult as well as the fact that I'm a music teacher jazz musician roommates usually don't work out... I have an upright bass that costs more than a car, having a roommate I can trust with a dog and my instruments is not something that I can just find on Craigslist. So we come to the nuclear option, I can live out of a pickup truck and rent a storage facility, and register with a doggie daycare and gym membership. Or I could move to a different city like Austin Texas Nashville Tennessee somewhere on the Gulf Coast like New Orleans Biloxi Mississippi. It's a free market and if there is not a market for me to purchase a place and reasonable price I'll just go somewhere where there is I can make about the same amount of money Painting and teaching. If I made more money I still wouldn't be able to stay here because you just can't find a place even if I were to get a studio apartment at 1200 dollars a month they don't last more than 24 hours.

And the latter can actually be great. My best friend lives in Boise and it's super cheap and she adores that city.   I guess I feel like people keep ragging on Denver not realizing that all of the other big and popular cities are on par or worse than here. I lived in NYC for three years and San Diego for two. Denver feels like a cheap heaven to me after that. Hahah. It all depends on what OP wants though. Like other people mentioned - what hobbies are important to them, what amenities etc.   For me, I prefer to be in a place where I have access to high quality food & grocery stores, where I'm close to my family, and I love the weather (to name a few).

It may have more difference between the top and bottom end, but on the average it is about the same.

Denver,3drljw,BellaLou324,2,Sat Jul 18 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"I've been casually looking at this for a while, and unless you move to Detroit you will pay similar rates now or within the next couple years for any metro area. You may be able to buy somewhere that isn't going nuts on the purchase end, but rental rates are spiking everywhere within 45 minutes of a decent city, all over the country.

Aspen, Tahoe, Sedona, etc are $$$ despite being fairly small.  Actually, Chattanooga would be fantastic. If you like Denver for its urban-ness with access to the out of doors and not crazy-conservative vibe. It's a college town to boot. I can see rent prices there spiking in the near future as Atlanta is close by and on a similar trend to Denver in terms of cost of living trends, though not yet as nutty as here.

I find all the cool neighborhoods before the hipsters do, then move because everyone comes in and the prices jump (I think landlords must consider average income of residents as at least part of their formula). I kid, of course, but there is no feeling like moving from a $425/month studio in Cap Hill in 2010 to a studio on East Colfax in 2012 that went for $650 after I moved out in 2014. The same studios in Cap Hill are closing in on $800, nearly doubled in under five years! That doubling more than the actual rate is what kills me.

But so does everyone else, and they're all flocking to specific areas because it's cool to live there.  This is where I say a big fuck-you to Booomers and Gen-X'ers who were all flocking to the burbs and wanted cookie-cutter McMansions where you were forced to drive to everything. If older people had stayed in urban areas instead of participating in the white-flight, or at least not participated in NIMBYism, mixed-use areas would be at a premium.

Portland metro rent was going to be about as expensive if I'd moved on my own, but groceries were much cheaper, gasoline was about on par (my car's one of those that will knock without 87 octane, no matter how much air is missing), the electricity and natural gas were FAR cheaper, many cheaper places to go out, and equally shitty traffic (except for a good reason -- only two bridges connecting Vancouver and Portland).  Portland proper is a nightmare to be in, the closer to downtown the more you'll spend on everything. If my pay doesn't rise with the costs here pretty soon I may go back there.  Someone else mentioned Reno. That town's dying. The casinos are empty because few people have disposable money to blow, and the undisposable money dried up too. You'll get a place cheap, but it'll get cheaper, because their economy (gambling and tourism) is unfortunately toast. Which is too bad... hot, sunny, dry days were a high point of me coming here, and I haven't had much of that... but Reno does still have that in abundance.  Otherwise, rents everywhere are jacking up for reasons I don't understand... so... good luck wherever you go, but it won't stay cheap for long without some intervention."

Denver,3dnfij,-SnowmanMafia-,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"The only time you should go through a yellow is is you are in the intersection when the light is green. If you are running a yellow you're in the wrong. If you're in the intersection during a red you're breaking the law. Laws require penalties or they aren't followed so police enforce them. That doesn't make them an asshole.  edit: fixed a word  edit 2: I'll post this here instead of individual replies to each of the current respondents below; At RTD we are taught to red the lights for 'stagnation', which is a way of saying a light that has been green for too long. If you suspect the light is going to turn yellow on you before you reach it then you are told that you must slow and stop the bus. If for whatever reason the cameras of the bus are reviewed and its seen that you are in the intersection while the light is red you are considered to have run a red light. You get two of those then you are terminated. Its not hard to read a light and decide the safe course of action is to wait the minute for the next cycle to make it your turn instead of blowing through to be one of the last two assholes (which is a phenomenon pointed out to me by another /r/denver redditor that says at any given light two people will try to push through no matter what)."
Denver,3dnfij,Fofolito,4,Sat Jul 18 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"The only time you should go through a yellow is is you are in the intersection when the light is green.   Or, to be fair, if it would be unsafe to stop. If I'm just shy of hitting the intersection when the light turns yellow and the roads are slick or there's someone on my ass, you bet I'm blowing the yellow light. Better that than the alternatives."
Denver,3dnfij,bigstrat2003,4,Sat Jul 18 01:38:51 2015 UTC,If you're in the intersection during a red you're beeaking the law.    No. If you enter the intersection you are legally allowed to complete your maneuver. In colorado it is also not illegal to enter the intersection upon a yellow light.
Denver,3dnfij,-SnowmanMafia-,2,Sat Jul 18 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"Also most crosswalks have countdowns, which are supremely useful for gauging the light."
Denver,3dnfij,FragsturBait,2,Sat Jul 18 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"Quebec & Arapahoe is the intersection in question. It's 40 or 45 in all directions, it's 4 lanes, plus center turn and then right hand turn lanes in all 4 directions PLUS an island on all 4 sides.  If you are doing 40 and the light turns yellow when you are 50 feet away, you can't stop because of how close you are and the intersection is so wide, you can't make it across in time, because it's a short yellow.  I know the laws, and I also know Greenwood Village sets up their major intersections to purposefully make it nearly impossible in to not ""break it"" in close situations like that.  And don't even get me started on the poorly aligned red-light cameras at Yosemite and Arapahoe that you can see flashing when all four directions and turn lanes are at dead stops.  Hence, assholes."

Denver,3dnfij,Fofolito,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:08 2015 UTC,So even if the light's green I should magically know exactly when it's going to turn yellow and start braking accordingly? You are a moron and part of the problem here.
Denver,3dnfij,cooldito,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"There's no need to resort to personal insults, we can talk this out like adults. There's no way to 100% predict a light, I'll grant you that, but there are ways to judge a light. I put this concept into practice daily at work, you know, driving RTD buses.   You can see for yourself if a light has been green for an extraordinary amount of time. If you're at an intersection with a primary (Colfax, Broadway, Sheridan) or secondary road (Downing, Garrison, Syracuse) chances are it will turn yellow soon. If its a tertiary (residential side road) and its been green a long time chances are it will turn yellow at some point.  There are crosswalk signals at most primary and secondary road intersections. If the man is walking you're good to go. If the hand is flashing you might consider that the light will change soon. If there's a count down the light will turn yellow one tick after the count reaches one.    Again, we're talking safety here. You're in control of several thousand pounds of steel and aluminum traveling at several tens of miles an hour: why wouldn't you do the safe thing and ensure you're clear of the intersection during or before the yellow light? Is saving one minute on your trip going to save the rest of your day?"

I have a hard time finding parking all the time because people park in the disabled spots without permits all the time and don't get punished for it.  And if there are no spots, people park in the striped lines so I cannot get out of my own car.    I have a disability that is invisible.  I am in constant pain, and I cannot climb over the other seats in my car to get out or into my car when people park like this without dislocating various joints.  Seriously, guys, if you see people doing this, please, please report it!  There's even various apps you can download to send photos to your local police.

Should parents who drink have their kids taken away on the spot? Otherwise the kid might have to witness alcohol use, and according to you, we can't have that."
Denver,3dm6cq,Stormwatch36,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"lol, you didn't even read either of my sources. You're just on here to troll it's obvious.  If you truly cared about your side of this debate then you would provide sources that say the opposite and prove your point. Yet, you can't provide a source the promotes alcohol advertising as a positive thing. I'm also for banning Fast Food advertisements, this contributes to the negative lifestyle.  Just so you know, banning Fast Food had the following results(and this was only a ban during childrens programming)   The authors use a triple difference-indifference methodology by appropriately defining treatment and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week. Overall, the authors estimate that the ban reduced fast-food consumption by Us$88 million per year.    source: http://works.bepress.com/kathy_baylis/33/ http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.5.799  edit: lol, nice edit with that adding that last part in there, I guess my above comment offended you that much that you dont wanna lose your CREDIBILITY.   So tell me how that argument makes sense? You state the following:   Should parents who drink have their kids taken away on the spot?    Yet, you are trying to make it seem as if there is no context here. Is the parent actively drinking in front of the child? Is the parent a risk to alcohol abuse? Is the child at risk? None of the above questions have been answered, yet you are trying to make a point that the child is viewing the parent drinking? Please clarify because otherwise this refute you have presented to me is completely useless."
Denver,3dm6cq,diskx,4,Fri Jul 17 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"calling the running of a tv ad for legal marijuana ""exploitation"" is possibly the most ridiculously patronizing and naive statement I have ever seen on reddit."

Are you against legalization in general?"
Denver,3dm6cq,Stormwatch36,2,Fri Jul 17 21:02:27 2015 UTC,why don't or can't ads promote that?
Denver,3dm6cq,SomalianRoadBuilder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"If weed ads are made illegal, is that going to stop people who are prone to addiction from getting it? What about people who are one joint away from their first onset of schizophrenia, is the lack of ads going to stop them? Especially in this day and age, with Netflix, TiVo fast-forwarding, and Adblock, they might already be blocking all ads. So how do we know the right people are being shielded by this hypothetical restriction? Not to mention that some people are cripplingly addicted to shopping, in general. Should we ban the entire practice of advertising, to protect those people? Why is protecting these strangers our business in the first place? Do they not have the right to make their own bad decisions?  I use adblock+noscript and I don't watch regular TV, so frankly I don't care if there are weed ads or not, I'll never see them. But this whole argument that they should be banned because people can't control their actions reminds me of the ""Grand Theft Auto causes mass shootings"" debate.   In my opinion, I'm not the world's babysitter. I don't tell the gambling addicts that they should leave when I go to a casino, even though it's extremely obvious who they are. I don't tell families who collectively weigh several tons that they should eat somewhere else if I find myself in a McDonald's with them. If I see a kid being overly violent with the ants at the park, I don't approach their mother about what games they're allowed to play at home. Pillheads walk around my downtown on a daily basis, I leave them the hell alone. It's their life, none of my business. I'm not going to try to police what people watch on TV based on their bad habits. If someone is such a routine addict that they can't see a thirty second segment about weed on TV without an immediate relapse, what's going to happen when they walk down the street and see someone smoking, putting them in a scenario where all they have to do is say ""can I get a hit of that""? These people need to learn how to function in the world, on their own terms. Having society babysit them isn't going to accomplish anything good in the long-term."

My very Republican grandfather wouldn't touch the Rocky for all of it's ""liberalism"" - I liked parts of both, but always thought that the RMN had better sports and international news, while the Post had better local/regional news and a better features section.  I also really liked the RMN columnists (political and not), and I'm a lefty.  I guess the take-away for me is that competition was very strong in this town; many people would take sides and put down whichever paper they didn't choose, but both were really very good newspapers.

""Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh."""

Denver,3dkvhb,rich8n,8,Fri Jul 17 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"Quote from the article--  The officer’s account was shockingly the one that seems the closest to being honest. Walker claimed that he felt “immediate pain” and “forcefully threw Ms. Acker … face down on the ground,” and pinned her. “It was then evident that I had caused her injury and knocked out her front tooth while throwing her on to the hard linoleum hospital floor, while her hands [were] still handcuffed behind her back,” Walker writes. --"
Denver,3dkvhb,africabound,4,Fri Jul 17 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"A bit of faith restored, good on him for telling the truth and owning up to it."
Denver,3dkvhb,Bacch,32,Fri Jul 17 05:13:20 2015 UTC,"Devil's advocate here.  The officer in question clearly overreacted by throwing the woman onto the floor. That was completely unnecessary and violent.  However, at the start, he didn't 'punch her in the stomach' as the article says.   He clearly pushed her downward into the chair by pushing on her torso.  That's the middle of her body and center of gravity.  She was under arrest and resisting to sit down, so he pushed her into the chair. Pushing is forceful, but not harmful.  Then... she kicked him in the shin (or clearly tried to).  That wasn't necessarily harmful either but it wasn't 'self defense' as the article claims.  It was a violent reaction to being pushed.  That is a pretty natural reaction to have, but still the wrong reaction in that situation. If you kick an officer (especially one on duty and in uniform), you shouldn't be too surprised when they take action to subdue you.  That doesn't excuse his response which was clearly overkill.    I just wouldn't say the woman in question, was completely innocent.  TL;DR - They both made mistakes.  It was NOT simply a case of excessive force."

Denver,3dkvhb,obvom,2,Fri Jul 17 05:33:48 2015 UTC,"We have to ask ourselves why law enforcement in the US seems to draw so disproportionately more of these violent individuals than law enforcement elsewhere.  Could it be a cultural issue?  Could it be our different laws?   If I had to guess, it may have to do with the way that our law enforcement in this country is implemented.  It seems often used as a method of control and separation of subcultures which further separates officers from civilians.  This cultural confrontation may then lead to officers often using more force than in other cultures/societies which I believe would open opportunities for violent types to be drawn to and more tolerated by law enforcement."

Denver,3dkvhb,Jackalopecia,4,Fri Jul 17 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"I commented on the article, which made statements that do not reflect what happened in the video.  1) The officer did not punch the person under arrest in the stomach.  2) She was not defending herself when she kicked the officer.  She was assaulting (or attempting to assault) an officer.    I completely agree that his reaction to that was unwarranted and unjust.  I simply mean to point out what it looks like in the video, and how, IMHO, that doesn't match up to the article.  Obviously, the alternate side exaggerates in the opposite, it just didn't seem like anyone was pointing out this end of the truth being twisted as well.  I imagine the article is written that way because it gets more attention."
Denver,3dkvhb,Albert-o-saurus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"Whenever one of these police/suspect videos pops up, I think a better thought experiment than the 'devil's advocate' is to ask yourself, ""How would I feel if this same person were to become my neighbor, my child's coach, or a loved-one's spouse?""  I like it more because it ignores legal questions like guilt or innocence and justified or unjustified action, and it avoids questions of degree of force, which is difficult to parse out because it is ultimately subjective.  Rather, it becomes a question of character.  To answer my own question, I would be deeply concerned for the safety and welfare of myself and my family.  It's pretty clear, that when this guy gets angry, he gets violent and I don't care if my son talked back or if my sister picked on him, or if I don't mow my lawn enough when he's acting recklessly and I or someone I love suffers the consequences."

Denver,3dkvhb,AdmiralBallsack,7,Fri Jul 17 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think I disagree about not taking sides. Dealing with disobedient, violent, and annoying people is one of the most common aspects of a Police officer's job. They're literally trained and paid to handle situations like this. His response to her shin-kick was completely disproportionate and he basically completely failed his job. Nobody is arguing that she was without fault, but by definition cops arrest people who they think are at fault. So by definition they should be experts at dealing with people in that situation. Instead he acted like a roid-raging violent animal. Any other profession that caught it's employee on camera failing so miserably at their job would immediately terminate that employee."

Denver,3dkvhb,AnonymousChicken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"If a man can't keep his cool with a drunk teenager, he shouldn't be a police officer.   These individuals must be exceptional in every way.  Brave, wise, patient, and calm are requirements for the position.  When someone behaves so extremely and impulsively as a knee-jerk reaction to a restrained drunk teenaged girls juvenile petulance, he demonstrates a profound lacking in his character.   He isn't simply unqualified, he is unworthy to act as a police officer.  True, he was provoked, and I have no problem that he responded physically, but if an orderly had done the same thing, he absolutely would have been arrested for assault.   Do we not hold police officers, with their extensive training and experience to a higher standard? Can we not agree that the select few, who are allowed to burden themselves with the responsibility of using violence in the name of the state and for the benefit of all MUST also be the most reluctant and most restrained? When did a badge and a gun become some sort of litmus test for acceptable violence? Why are we asking if violence is permitted, when the standard is, is violence JUSTIFIED?  Police work is hard and dangerous, and this man is not up to the job. He got mad so he used violence to hurt someone, that's the behavior of a sociopath and it is not just unprofessional it is dangerous in a police officer. Violently slamming a persons head on the ground is potentially deadly. Head and neck trauma are by their nature more lethal and I don't want to live in a state where such dramatic violence is the consequence for drunkenness.  I don't know if this particular 'peace' officer committed a crime or if he broke policy or if he deviated from procedure.  I'm actually pretty dubious, but of one thing I am certain:  This officer gets angry easily and when he is angry, he is impulsive and violent.  As a police officer, he is unlikely to experience any consequences for his violent behavior so it will not stop.  Actually, as a police officer, he will likely be protected, even if he should kill someone.  That doesn't make me feel safe, that doesn't make me trust the police, and I have profound doubts about their role in our community as a result.  This guy shouldn't be a cop, and not just because he beat up a drunk girl.  He shouldn't be a cop, because he makes them worse, he weakens their position in society, he compromises their effectiveness, and compromises the dignity and worth of his fellow officers.  He is a problem, and he make our communities more dangerous."

Denver,3dkvhb,skeletorcares,7,Fri Jul 17 12:32:33 2015 UTC,"Now this is a whole thing again because this lady...   That's victim blaming of the worst kind. Are you really defending this officer's reaction and suggesting that the woman is primarily the one at fault? He's supposed to be TRAINED to deal with this kind of thing, and with two other officers on site there was clearly no reason for him to slam a cuffed, 110 pound girl on her face.  Well, there's one reason I can think of - she was mouthy and he lacks the ability to remain professional in the face of insults. Something she said to him probably hit too close to home, and he reacted like a coward."

This guy did.  Cops are not trained to slam teenage girls face-first into the floor with all of their body weight plus additional downward force.  He was pissed because she was disrespecting his authority and he was going to show her who is boss.   Justify all you like, I as a citizen do not want that guy on the streets where my loved ones can be brutalized with impunity because this guy needs to be ""the man"".

If you had reacted even more violently to that exact situation than the cop did (as you insinuate you would), you'd be in jail without question.  Unless, of course you are a cop too.   Being a cop is a HARD job.  I don't discount that.  I cannot fathom the amount of bullshit and human garbage they have to put up with every day.   But some people just aren't cut out for the hard jobs.  Added to that, cops HAVE to be held to a higher standard of behavior, because unlike other professions, they have both the power and authority to inflict their will on other people.  My plumber can't do that.  My lawyer can't do that.   My doctor can't do that."

Who kicks a police officer and expects nothing to happen? I made it though my teens without a smashed in face, and I got drunk all the time. Never once was I even tempted to assault a police officer."
Denver,3dkvhb,PlattFish,4,Fri Jul 17 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"The only sympathy I have for the teen is that she had brutal corporal punishment dispensed to her without any due process.   Her ""kick"" didn't hurt that cop.   It pissed him off.  She was certainly stupid.   I don't think she ""kicked a police officer and expected nothing to happen"".   She wasn't thinking of consequences of her actions at all.   She deserves punishment for her actions, but it wasn't the cop's place to decide and dispense it.   He could have subdued her in any number of ways and let the judicial system decide her fate, but he chose to lash out violently and brutalize her.  Would any court in the land have sentenced her to having her face smashed in as a punishment for her kick and resisting arrest?  Then the cop shouldn't have instantly sentenced and carried out that punishment to her either."

Denver,3dkvhb,PlattFish,2,Fri Jul 17 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with most of that.   I know Reddit can seem anti-cop most of the time, but that's because it's mostly the minority of bad stories that make it to discussion.   There are plenty of great cops out there, far more than the bad ones, but the predilection for all cops to stand up and staunchly defend even the worst of the worst among them does little to counter that bias.  I do think regarding your statement that ""I know police can get violent with little provocation, so I don't provoke them"", that it is perfectly fine to be VEHEMENTLY against the complacency we have towards the concept that cops can get violent with little provocation.  We don't accept this as the norm from any other profession, we shouldn't accept it from those who are paid to be our protectors."
Denver,3dkvhb,rich8n,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"I agree fully with you, the violence these days from police is out of hand. But I don't think blatant disrespect for officers is the solution. I also don't think anyone would have thought twice about this story if it was some bum in a drunken rage that got cuffed and sat down by a cop. Especially if the bum then attacked he officer.

It IS expensive, but it's a great ride both ways and beautiful (and windy and cold) at the top. But it is also a pretty rare experience, so it's memorable, particularly if you like trains. The drive up is just as cool in its own way- you can stop wherever you want along the route. But I love trains so it was a really fun thing for us to do."

Denver,3dn057,AltoidStorm,5,Fri Jul 17 16:26:34 2015 UTC,Definitely do it once. The scenery is beautiful on the way up and down - and it's a neat historical experience as well. I did it last summer and had a great time.  I'd like to drive up next time and spend more time at the very top.
Denver,3dn057,needanacc0unt,4,Sat Jul 18 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is worth it once, but if I go to Pikes Peak again, I'll drive up. The ride was nice, good views, and saw some big horned sheep or whatever their called, but once we were up there it was very rushed. We walked around a bit, had one of the donuts they make out to be amazing... it was just another donut... and then had to get right back on the train. All in all we were only up there and off the train for like 25 minutes. I think you can skip your train and wait for the next to take you down, but we were on the last one for the day."

Super easy to just drive along a Forest Service road (brown signage) and look for dispersed camping along the road marked by a fire circle of rocks.

To be honest I'm not really a fan of these projects because they bring more people to places - more garbage, more noise, less solitude.  Some of the high traffic sites have gotten pretty nasty over the years.   The best places are the ones you find exploring anyway, and a lot of them are reached by foot.

Denver,3djxyp,OkiDokiTokiLoki,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:02 2015 UTC,Not a big surprise
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,10,Thu Jul 16 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"The Jury would either have to be high, drunk, or stupid to find Not Guilty. Insanity was also a stretch."
Denver,3djxyp,WestonP,5,Thu Jul 16 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, although in laymans terms, ""insanity"" seems obvious... sane people don't do what he did. It's just not a valid defense in this case."
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,10,Thu Jul 16 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"Good point. Holmes was 5 beers short of a six pack, that was obvious, but being fucking nuts is not the same as being legitimately insane. If he had mountains of journals and discussions with shrinks talking about how a pink bunny man was telling him to kill people, he might have had a leg to stand on.  Instead he was pretty coherent in knowing his actions and the outcomes. Still makes him fucking nuts, but not criminally... or whatever."
Denver,3djxyp,OkiDokiTokiLoki,6,Thu Jul 16 22:25:34 2015 UTC,"It's a ""let's see if I can get away with it"" defense"
Denver,3djxyp,mojobytes,3,Thu Jul 16 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"More of a ""we have to do something because we're willing to plead guilty and get to sentencing but a trial is being forced on us."""
Denver,3djxyp,dalenar,2,Fri Jul 17 01:57:53 2015 UTC,They wanted an agreement that took the death penalty off the table.  He always had the option of pleading guilty to the charges in lieu of an agreement.
Denver,3djxyp,mojobytes,3,Fri Jul 17 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"DA must be thankful, how would he run for senate without a trial?"
Denver,3djxyp,dalenar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're referring to, but it sounds like a separate issue.  I wasn't commenting on the motivations of the prosecutor, I was responding to your comment that the trial was ""forced"" on Mr. Holmes.  It was not.    He could have pleaded guilty the day he was arraigned or any time thereafter and gone immediately to sentencing.  He did not.  He opted instead to plead not guilty, and thus invoked his right to a trial.  Only he can know the reason why with certainty.  On open plea would have exposed him to the possibility of a death sentence.  My guess is that he, like the 12 people he murdered, had a desire to avoid execution."
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,3,Fri Jul 17 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"It was a total punt play by the defense, that's for sure."
Denver,3djxyp,OobaDooj,3,Thu Jul 16 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, although in laymans terms, ""insanity"" seems obvious... sane people don't do what he did.   That's not really layman so much as a literal interpretation, and it's partially inaccurate.       In states that allow the insanity defense, defendants must prove to the court that they did not understand what they were doing; failed to know right from wrong; acted on an uncontrollable impulse or some variety of these factors."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,5,Thu Jul 16 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"Colorado is a little bit different -- the prosecution had to prove that he was sane, rather than the defense having to prove insanity.  The prosecution did a pretty good job proving that he did things that an insane person would not do, and he know what he was doing."
Denver,3djxyp,DontEstopBelievin,5,Thu Jul 16 22:29:39 2015 UTC,"Here is the full statute. It definitely is not the typical lay concept of insanity. And you are correct about the burden of proving sanity falling upon the prosecution.    C.R.S. 16-8-101.5  (1) The applicable test of insanity shall be:  (a) A person who is so diseased or defective in mind at the time of the commission of the act as to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to that act is not accountable; except that care should be taken not to confuse such mental disease or defect with moral obliquity, mental depravity, or passion growing out of anger, revenge, hatred, or other motives and kindred evil conditions, for, when the act is induced by any of these causes, the person is accountable to the law; or  (b) A person who suffered from a condition of mind caused by mental disease or defect that prevented the person from forming a culpable mental state that is an essential element of a crime charged, but care should be taken not to confuse such mental disease or defect with moral obliquity, mental depravity, or passion growing out of anger, revenge, hatred, or other motives and kindred evil conditions because, when the act is induced by any of these causes, the person is accountable to the law.  (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section:  (a) ""Diseased or defective in mind"" does not refer to an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.  (b) ""Mental disease or defect"" includes only those severely abnormal mental conditions that grossly and demonstrably impair a person's perception or understanding of reality and that are not attributable to the voluntary ingestion of alcohol or any other psychoactive substance but does not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.  (3) This section shall apply to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1995.   People v. Serravo, 823 P.2d 128 (Colo. 1992), added this clarification to the former version of the statute (the part that is now section (1)(a)):   Construing the term ""wrong"" in accordance with societal standards of morality results in a substantially more objective standard of moral wrong than the purely personal and subjective moral standard, under which an accused could be adjudicated insane even if he knew that the act in question was both forbidden by law and condemned by society, but nonetheless harbored a personal belief that the act was right. A personal and subjective standard of morality should not be permitted to exonerate a defendant any more than an ignorance of the law, engendered by a mental illness, should be equated with legal insanity. In sum, the appropriate construction of the term ""incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to [the] act"" in section 16-8-101 should be measured by existing societal standards of morality rather than by a defendant's personal and subjective understanding of the legality or illegality of the act in question."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"Especially if there was any chance that he could get out with the ""insanity"" defense.  Definitely not a big surprise, though."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 22:25:52 2015 UTC,You should really just sticky and use this thread.
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 21:46:25 2015 UTC,Yeah you are right. I think I just wanted to be fair(?) and let the sticky be the first post with the verdict but I think just updating the text of this post with information would probably make things a little easier.
Denver,3djxyp,goooooller,3,Thu Jul 16 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely think so.  Then there's not a bunch of posts from people trying to get their post up top and trying to reap that sweet, sweet karma."
Denver,3djxyp,Greatgat,3,Thu Jul 16 22:01:08 2015 UTC,I'm going for 165/165.
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,3,Thu Jul 16 22:29:21 2015 UTC,Thaaaank fuuuuuuck. I had a lot of confidence in the prosecution but it's still a relief.
Denver,3djxyp,Greatgat,5,Thu Jul 16 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"It's just nice to see this ""over"".  The appeals will happen for years, but the core trial is done and over with."
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,19,Thu Jul 16 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Sis, her boyfriend and I were there, she got shot and her boyfriend didn't make it. Shit has sucked for a long time, we're glad at least this part is done with."
Denver,3djxyp,tenorsaxman11,7,Thu Jul 16 22:35:05 2015 UTC,That's why I hope the sentence is just life in prison with no parole. The appeals process won't be nearly as fucked. Put his ass in Supermax and let him rot.
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,4,Thu Jul 16 23:06:12 2015 UTC,Execution would be a sympathy killing and I have none either.
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,5,Thu Jul 16 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I'm against the death penalty pretty much because it costs too much, takes too long, too many death row cases have been overturned later when they found the person was innocent by DNA testing (older cases, but points out how retarded the legal system can be).  I'd be all for it if it were cases like this one where there is absolutely no doubt at all, and if there was one appeal, then he's marched into a room and just done with (electric chair, wood chipper, don't care, just be done with it)."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 23:20:26 2015 UTC,:-( I am sorry for your loss. Hopefully this can help bring some closure.
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,2,Fri Jul 17 02:28:53 2015 UTC,The defense really put on a poor show.
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,12,Thu Jul 16 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Did you expect much? They had no case. The only way this could be worse for the defense is if the entire thing had been on 1080p HD video, and at one point Holmes had walked up to the camera and said ""I'm James Holmes, and I know that I'm killing people, and it's wrong"" shoots someone ""But it's so much fun."""
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,6,Thu Jul 16 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"I thought that they might have better prepared their witness experts. But no, they are public defenders, and there is only so much they can do with an obviously guilty client."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 23:10:16 2015 UTC,"It's like playing blackjack, but you know the house has 21. You make the minimum bet and hope for the best.  Seriously, this guy probably should have gone with suicide by cop. He'll probably realize this mistake after week 4 in solitary."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 23:17:14 2015 UTC,I am honestly surprised that that wasn't how this turned out. That is part of the reason that I thought that he must have had some sort of breakdown.
Denver,3djxyp,SaudiAurora,3,Fri Jul 17 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"Well, expect another month of trial, and then probably 2-3 appeals trials.  If they sentence him to death, it will probably be several years before they carry it out."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"If he gets the death sentence, it'll be more than just several years.  Nathan Dunlap is still sitting on death row, 20 years after shooting up a Chuck-E-Cheese in Aurora.  Holmes will be there for awhile."
Denver,3djxyp,COScout,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"My lower estimate was based on the possibility that a new Republican governor is elected on a platform of clearing out death row.  Dunlap is still sitting there because Hickenlooper doesn't want to sign the death warrant.  It could also just as likely be the case that he is never executed, if sentenced to death.  I'm not really for the death penalty (I don't think the government should be in the business of killing its citizens, and in a lot of cases there are a lot of flaws in making sure we convict the right person).  However, in this case, we do know that this person was the person who committed the action (and that was never disputed), and what he did was so horrible and gruesome.  I don't think I will shed a tear either way it goes."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,4,Fri Jul 17 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"If they sentence him to death, it will probably be several years before they carry it out.   The last person executed in Colorado was in 1997 and he's been the only one since 1975. If they sentence him to death, the death penalty will likely be removed from Colorado before it gets to him. They may as well save a bunch of money and just let him get life in prison."
Denver,3djxyp,Zuhorer,4,Fri Jul 17 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think it is also highly dependent on who the next governor is. Some potential candidates were running on a policy of clearing out death row last time around (and I don't mean by commuting sentences).  But in general, I definitely agree."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,2,Thu Jul 16 23:33:55 2015 UTC,"That does not diminish the sentencing we're hearing now, nor the incredible number of counts of murder and attempted murder he has been found guilty for.   Process is slow, but not unimportant."
Denver,3djxyp,GringodelRio,3,Fri Jul 17 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know it.  I would rather that the process be slow and that there be many checks and balances.  Truth be told, I'm not really the biggest supporter of capital punishment at all.  The process is incredibly important."
Denver,3djxyp,apathetictransient2,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:15 2015 UTC,Hate is kind of weak. I think you were looking for loathe with every fiber of your being.
Denver,3djxyp,MockOutrage,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:04 2015 UTC,That's what he wants.
Denver,3djxyp,edditorRay,4,Thu Jul 16 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"Not really surprising when you consider the fact that Holmes offered a guilty plea in exchange for no chance at the death penalty back in 2013.  But hey, at least we got a cool trial and the opportunity to kill him later!"
Denver,3djxyp,bigstrat2003,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"Fry fucker fry.  Unfortunately, he'll spend the rest of his life in prison, sucking down taxpayer money into keeping his worthless ass alive another forty years."
Denver,3djxyp,implicitly_bonsai,10,Fri Jul 17 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"Well for better or for worse, our legal system doesn't allow for that. He's obviously guilty, there can be no mistake in this case. But given that our system prioritizes making absolutely sure there are no mistakes before executing someone, our options are to let him rot in prison or let him rot on death row for years and go through all sorts of appeals. Since letting him rot in prison is actually less expensive to the taxpayers, I'd rather go with that option."
Denver,3djxyp,sheepdogzero,11,Thu Jul 16 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"Since letting him rot in prison is actually less expensive to the taxpayers, I'd rather go with that option.   Absolutely agree. However, I'd place higher importance on not giving the State any right to take lives.  It's really disgusting how many people are foaming at the mouth for this guy's blood."
Denver,3djxyp,sonowruhappy1,3,Thu Jul 16 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you how you solve that problem, leave him in General Population down at Florence.  Edit: Upon further research it seems as though Supermax is mostly solitary confinement.  It's also been described as ""a clean version of hell"" by the former warden.  So i guess I'm ok with that."
Denver,3djxyp,they_have_bagels,3,Thu Jul 16 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"You realize the death penalty is more expensive than life in prison, right?"
Denver,3djxyp,mesostoney,5,Fri Jul 17 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, he WILL spend the rest of his life in prison.  It's just that it may be 10 years as opposed to 60."
Denver,3djxyp,AustinDAkens,3,Fri Jul 17 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Which sounds like less of a punishment to me. If you're going to die anyway, what's the point of living life out in a cell? The hope that you'll outlive the ""life"" sentence? I feel like a psychopath could care less about dying earlier if the alternative was life in a cage."
Denver,3djxyp,stunkcrunk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% for the death penalty in a lot of cases.

Denver,3dk4p6,Autodidact2,0,Thu Jul 16 22:34:28 2015 UTC,"Didn't they run this for a couple days last year?  For something like $65 a person?  I am sure it wont be as pricey if they are filling it each weekend, but unless its under about $10 a person, its cheaper to carpool."
Denver,3dk4p6,erickssm,3,Thu Jul 16 22:49:26 2015 UTC,"The price was high in part because they ran it on a limited basis. Supply and demand at work. It was a novelty. If it was to run on a more permanent basis, it's reasonable to assume the price would be lower."
Denver,3dk4p6,MilkyPuff,3,Fri Jul 17 01:19:28 2015 UTC,Except it used to be that expensive when it ran every weekend as well.
Denver,3dk4p6,mikegfx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:57:55 2015 UTC,It did sell out in hours though.
Denver,3dk4p6,bigtexatx,2,Fri Jul 17 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"The last year's run of 2 trains sold out in hours. Previous to that it did not sell out and was so lacking in customers they stopped it. Although there seems to be along side the constant increase in Denver people those that want the train again. I think $65 it's perfectly great for me.  I also want this to be a thing I'm not trying to say this isn't wonderful and I also wish the price would be less but I'm also cool paying the higher price for the knowing that the chance of being stuck behind someone crashed on I70 is minimized. I don't have to deal with the weather elements and can just rock it chatting away with friends while I get up there. So don't get me wrong, I want the train to succeed."
Denver,3dk4p6,cjpapetti,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah hopefully it's cheaper. However even $65 isn't outrageous considering you get to skip the horrendous ski traffic, enjoy a great view, pay no gas money, and drink alcohol on the way there/back. I only ski a couple times a year anyway so I'll definitely be using this train even if it's still $65!"
Denver,3dk4p6,erickssm,3,Fri Jul 17 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, they brought it back for a day or so. The big deal is that people will be able to fly into DIA, train to Union Station, train to Winter Park and ski. It will be the only place in the country where this is possible, and IMO it will add to our tourist draw. I think quite a few will add a night or two downtown, bringing in even more tourist revenue. Brilliant."
Denver,3dk4p6,I_Call_It_Vera,3,Fri Jul 17 13:28:50 2015 UTC,How much money does Colorado bring in every year in tourism?
Denver,3dk4p6,Matute97,3,Fri Jul 17 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"$18.6 billion, to be exact.  ""The Colorado Tourism Office (CTO) recently announced that Colorado set all-time records in terms of visitor volume, visitor expenditures and tax revenue in 2014, welcoming 71.3 million visitors to the state who spent $18.6 billion and generated $1.1 billion in tax revenue."" - http://www.gjfreepress.com/news/17293057-113/colorado-tourism-sets-record-in-2014"

""Oh, well I was going to take 3 days off work, but since I can take a train into the mountains, I am going to take 5 days off work!""  Not logical.  Next, in the case of a tourist, the funds to use the train would have been spent (in most cases, two or three times as much) on a rental car. Not adding value as far as tourism goes.  Saving people money in some cases.  Lastly, WP is probably #6 or #7 on the list of popularity for tourists.  I know a lot of locals that go there just to avoid tourists.  Get a train system that goes to all the main tourists resorts (Vail, Breck, Aspen, Steamboat, Telluride, Keystone, Copper, BC, CB) have it leave from DIA, Denver, Boulder, FTC and C Springs, more than once a day....and now you have something attractive to tourists.

Denver,3djgu0,audiophilistine,13,Thu Jul 16 19:44:02 2015 UTC,It won't be announced until 4PM per the Post
Denver,3djgu0,DeviatedNorm,11,Thu Jul 16 19:44:45 2015 UTC,Guilty on 165 counts.
Denver,3djgu0,slowrecovery,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"Holmes was found guilty on 12 counts of first degree murder after deliberation, and another 12 counts of first degree murder with extreme indifference. He also was found guilty of all 70 counts of attempted murder after deliberation, and all 70 counts of attempted murder with extreme indifference.   C'mon. Two murder charges per victim?  How can you just add a qualifier and stick an extra murder charge per individual life lost?  As if the event weren't tragic enough, it still needs to be artificially ""trumped up""?  82 counts of murder and attempted murder isn't enough to consider a death sentence, we needed to double it?  How about we add first-degree murder with a stupid haircut? That makes it 247 charges."
Denver,3djgu0,BlackbeltJones,3,Fri Jul 17 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"They are distinct charges and a jury may convict a defendant of both, but his mittimus will reflect one first degree murder conviction for each victim.  Here is the Colorado Supreme Court opinion discussing the issue you raise."
Denver,3djgu0,dalenar,3,Fri Jul 17 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yes because they are two distinct charges.  Extreme indifference means that he acted with no regard for human life. This is a death penalty offense in Colorado. However if you only charge him this way you run the risk of a jury determining that he did commit murder, but without indifference which would not meet the charge.  So you also charge him with deliberate intent as his actions were clearly pre meditated.  Is it likely a jury will find him guilty of one and not the other? It's not, but why even take the risk?"
Denver,3djgu0,enjo13,0,Fri Jul 17 07:38:31 2015 UTC,"So it is that cut and dry, the criteria for a death sentence?  Murdering 12 people and attempting to murder 70 more in a random rampage does not justify a death sentence until the killer's ""disposition"" is taken into account... huh.  Maybe he didn't act with extreme indifference. Maybe he shot up the theater in a state of euphoric glee!  He was the Joker, after all.  Seems ridiculous, but the law is the law, I suppose."
Denver,3djgu0,BlackbeltJones,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:36:41 2015 UTC,Why do you care so much? He killed a lot of people and was found guilty... that's really all I care about. I don't understand being emotionally connected to the number of counts.
Denver,3djgu0,ZshadeZ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Cuz it smells like bullshit and I said something, that's all.  Without emotion, it objectively seems like bullshit.  If this defense is not compelling, then downvote me with extreme indifference  <<<-----------"

That would have also saved all the expense of the trial.  I feel the guy has obvious mental issues, which would make me hesitate to call for the death penalty.

From what I remember he was wearing tactical clothing that allowed him to carry the magazines and ammo but it was not a kevlar vest with trauma plates.   And most of the media sources also got this wrong as well.

Denver,3djgu0,raradee,2,Fri Jul 17 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"I've been on a jury that had to deliberate 30+ counts, and we would have been done after about 5 hours, except we had a few hold-outs on a few charges. The two counts we found a defendant not guilty on were argued for longer than the guilty charges.  Obviously not the same for every jury, but I would have to think in this case more of the jury would lean toward guilty and take longer to have their opinion changed.   The other thing is a lot of the counts are the same - just for different victims. And I would assume if you found him guilty on one of the murder chargers - he's guilty on all 12. Same with the 70 attempted murder, since it was all one terrible event."
Denver,3djgu0,SnowManson,5,Thu Jul 16 20:55:04 2015 UTC,"There is no chance it comes back as anything but guilty on all counts.  The defense's key witnesses for the insanity defense came across as inept at best.  They were really awful and did nothing to help Holmes.  The court appointed Dr's clearly were the most respected and thorough.  The prosecutor (George Brauchler) was also impressive to watch, very well prepared and ready to counter everything from the defense.    I thought maybe someone on the jury could be opposed to the death penalty and cause delays, etc. but with them to come back this fast I think it's clear they found him guilty.  Who knows though, I work in IT and have no legal background but did follow this trial pretty closely, if I was a juror it would be a simple decision."
Denver,3djgu0,jammbin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:45 2015 UTC,I think if it's a death penalty case all jurors have to be at least accepting of the death penalty. You can't be completely opposed to it or there would be too much bias during deliberation.
Denver,3djgu0,COPDFF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:02 2015 UTC,They don't decide on the death penalty simply by saying he's guilty. That comes after deciding if he is guilty or not.
Denver,3djgu0,ColoradoThinMint,0,Fri Jul 17 01:14:37 2015 UTC,I 100% agree with the verdict but the question I have is:   How in the fuck did the defense not challenge the juror that ended up being the jury foreman?!?!! He was at Columbine when the shooting of Harris and Klebold happened. If I'm a defense attorney and my client is going up against a mass murder charge the absolute last person I want on my jury is a mass shooting survivor. How do you not use one of your jury challenges for that individual and if they didn't know about it until after the jury was seated (which they shouldn't have that should have been answered on his questionnaire) they still could challenge because of extreme bias and his inability to be fair and impartial.

It seems strange to me that no one talked to BNR when the ballot measure was proposed and asked for a guess but that might not have mattered since Warren Buffet bough the company after the ballot measure passed changing the company environment.

Denver,3dke0r,MonsterBurrito,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"I have four huge trees and frequently have to deal with disposing of limbs since I prune them myself. I feel your pain. Unless you get one of the big temporary dumpsters from your waste company, probably the easiest thing to do is cut and bundle them yourself. If you cut them down yourself, you probably already have all the tools and the the work is easier than it sounds.   With dead branches, I put the smaller ones in a trash bag and then step on it to crush them up to fit more in the bag. With the live ones, I fill up a bag then stick in the pruners and cut up the branches to make more room. Do it before the leaves die and fall off the cut limbs to avoid mess. With the bigger branches I cut off the smaller bits and I lay the trimmed branches parallel in a bundle and then roll them in duct tape.  After the first roll around the bundle, you can tighten up the tape so the bundle holds together and is easy to lift without falling apart.  Then find out if your trash company has large item pick up day and put out the bundles then instead of filling up your container four times over the course of a month.  I think the duct tape is the key that makes cutting/bundling easy enough to fo myself.  I also have seen people illegally haul branches to a park dumpster in the dark of night for disposal but obviously I have not done this myself."

Denver,3djqpf,ColoradoMovieCars,17,Thu Jul 16 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"It would not trigger the gunshot listening devices. The bullwhip crack is a miniature sonic boom which has a characteristic inverted N shape wave. The gunshot listening devices are geared more toward detecting subsonic rounds typically used in handguns. When passed through the detection software, the filter would determine that the whip crack doesn't meet the profile of a typical gunshot. The human operator who reviews the sounds would also be able to confirm that it wasn't a gunshot.  Now, the other thing to consider is if the people who heard somebody driving through their neighborhood cracking a whip would call into 911 and describe it as a gunshot or mere archaeological tomfoolery."

But they don't even just play local music, it's entirely a ""whatever the fuck the DJ wants"" format. And some of the music they play just makes me shudder, as some of it is just crap.  OpenAir would be better if they settled on playing folk and/or rock music or something, then they could play a lot of local music (Yonder Mountain String Band being a big example) as well as things like The Decemberists, Passenger, etc. to mix it up.

Can't run a paper without money.  Jesus this guy is advocating for a journalism tax...  Go to China or North Korea to see how awesome state run media is.  Once taxes are collected that money is not public, that is government money and ripe for corruption and coercion.  NPR only gets 10% of its revenue from taxes and is constantly under attack.  Plus a tax is basically extortion.  Donate to a paper or buy a subscription, but don't force everyone else to get in line.  Ad revenue and page views are what is going to drive modern journalism, for good or bad.  On the bright side, more content is being created now than at any time in human history.

By print, I mean written journalism- whether in paper format or online doesn't really matter. Maybe I'm not using that term correctly, but that's what I was trying to say.

LOL  cause as far as i can tell they source their stories 98% from AP(the ones they dontm, they steal from the local TV news near word-for word.  then they slap so many ads in it its near unreadable - to make it ready for their paper/website.  Thats not even to mention they have no integrity, every article has a Horrible political slant to it.  It borders on a propaganda paper  its filled with bad grammar, misspellings, and poorly sourced and cited articles.  Their out of state financing bought out the RMN to kill it, The out of state office supplies all the stories and we're left with a Shit clone of every other DFN Site and paper.  They take Articles from their affiliated small town neighboring papers, supplement it with a script that flows in AP articles with a specific political lean to them, and pagefill with Ads.  I wouldnt put it in my birdcage.. i wouldnt want it to learn to read and see that.  papier mache is about all its good for, - Oh and compost for feeding earthworms  We'd be wholly better without any ""big"" paper at all, and relying on local everything for them."

However, I struggle to have sympathy for the Denver Post and other large newspapers that were impacted by the decline of print journalism.  I moved to Denver in 2005 after graduating from OSU with my degree in Public Affairs Journalism. I had been writing and covering the MLS for Goal.com for two years (previously SoccerAge.com) and covered crime, education, politics and more for The Lantern (unlike typical campus newspapers, it actually covered the Columbus metro area and was the daily with 7th-largest circulation in Ohio). I was a good reporter -- my stories were featured on the front page on 18 separate occasions. I am also bi-lingual and speak/write in Spanish.  None of this mattered when I applied to some lowly English/Spanish general assignment position. I was hungry and willing to work hard and do what it takes to establish a career in journalism, even at a time when everything seemed to be falling apart. Instead I received a joke of a rejection letter telling me that I should move to Texas to write for a small daily down there.  In the next year or so, the Rocky Mountain News shuttered and the Denver Post also felt the impact of the fall of print journalism. I wanted to stay in Denver and ended up falling into marketing. Can't say I love it always, but I feel like I dodged a bullet either way."
Denver,3dex8w,SurferGurl,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"All I can say dude is that you're not alone.  I too went to J-school from a well known state university, interned, can tell a compelling story and ... nothing.  The only chance to even interview was for a paper in a no-name town in the Nevada desert.  Their website made me think it was run by middle schoolers, and I turned down the interview.  I should be grateful it was a daily, at least...  I don't know a single classmate of mine who ever got a job as a reporter in any format, and we've been out of college for around a decade."

I graduated in Spring of 2005 and already in my last quarter the writing was on the wall for people with traditional journalism degrees. It's like I graduated with a nearly-obsolete education.  I never wanted to lose years of my life grinding my way up. I'm not afraid of working hard and putting in time, but I didn't want to do it in someplace I wouldn't be happy in the middle of nowhere.

Denver,3dex8w,riomx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:11:33 2015 UTC,"My parents were photographers (weddings, fine art) so I knew how to work a camera.

Six months ago I got out of that and now I work in manufacturing with a couple other guys.  It's in the photo field and we're inventing some new camera related stuff.  I contemplated going the photojournalism route, but I think those poor bastards got hit even worse than the writers.  Like you, I didn't care about the field enough to want to grind it out forever in the hopes of somehow landing a good job that would allow me to support not only myself but also a family.  Some of the salaries of those rookie jobs were a joke!  I think, unless you're already well-connected, graduate from a school with a big name (like an Ivy) or a noted expert in a field that wants to write about that topic, journalism as we knew it from a reporter's perspective is dead.  Fortunately the blogosphere has torn down those gates, in many ways, and I'm curious to see how curated blog aggregators like the new Apple News app will change things."

This is the kind of attitude that buried newspapers and gave way to the success of independent journalists and people working for new media outlets.  I was aware of the traditional path that required new graduates to grind their way to a decent position. I chose not to do that and move across the country yet again just to scrape by getting paid peanuts and working long hours. Instead, I stuck around in Denver and found success in digital marketing. I'm also confident that I've made more money than I ever would have as a general assignment reporter (not sure what salaries for reporters are these days, but in the mid-2000s they were dismal).  Either way, it didn't matter. Shortly after the cuts began and I probably would have been out of a job either way. In the end getting rejected put me on a better career path, and I'm thankful for that."
Denver,3dex8w,riomx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:08 2015 UTC,"Your failed attempt at a career in journalism and the decline of traditional print newspapers are hardly related.

I've seen several aspiring journalists refuse to put in the work to build a career and quickly abandon the dream while playing off their new job in a different field as a win. I don't doubt that many are happy in their second choice of a career, but it's still a second choice. And the way they can't just move on makes that clear.   Which doesn't make me angry. I find it funny. I expect and understand critiques of the media by everyday people. Often they're legit, and when they're not, they're usually at least worth discussing. The critiques from people who feel spurned by the industry, though, kinda just make me laugh.   (I do not work at a newspaper in Denver. Nor have I ever. Nor would I want to.)"
Denver,3dex8w,JustaGangsta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:47:05 2015 UTC,"Who is whining? I literally wrote out that I'm thankful that it happened.

Denver,3dex8w,riomx,0,Thu Jul 16 04:45:01 2015 UTC,I don't doubt that you're thankful. But it's a bitter kind of thankful. You've managed to intertwine your own rejection with a completely unrelated failure of newspapers to adapt to changing economic realities. Let it go.
Denver,3dex8w,ParkHillBilly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"You're projecting your own feelings onto what I wrote, and trying way too hard.

You mistakenly interpreted as me somehow implying my rejection as a causation of the collapse of newspapers, which if you were to take some time to reflect upon, is ridiculous.  I'm self-employed at 32 and enjoy flexibility and control over who I work with. I also have plenty of time with my family and to do the things I love. I wouldn't have any of that if I had stuck with reporting, so I have no reason to be bitter, but if it helps you to feel better and go on about your day, continue to believe that."

I don't take paper to read national stories 90% of the time... there are other outlets for that. I don't take a paper to read anything that would qualify breaking news (stuff that is interesting for the 1-hour it's happening). I take a paper for local stories, and in-depth reporting.  I'd pay for the Post if it ditched the national news completely other than major news, created sections for each of the metro regions (South Metro - Englewood, Littleton, Centennial, the villages; West Metro, Aurora, North Metro, Boulder, Foothills, The Plains, Elsewhere in Colorado, etc.), and did in-depth investigative reporting a la Pro Publica. I'd pay for it if it partnered with CPR News and RMPBS to provide content for on-air broadcasts. And I'd pay a decent amount for this.  I think a lot of people would as well. I don't mind ads, I don't even mind ads on websites, provided they don't fuck with how the page works.

Their website is absolutely atrocious and, as others have pointed out, their content isn't that great. You're the only major newspaper in the region and you can't manage to get an adequate website up?   I graduated from j-school last year and after seeing how newsrooms are run and how 98% of content comes straight from the AP, with little to no true investigative or shoe leather reporting, I decided it wasn't for me. The salaries and schedules for reporters are absurd. However, I have classmates who report and write incredible pieces and are willing to live on barely anything because they love journalism so much and they still haven't found jobs. Rather than constantly firing staff, maybe the DP should reevaluate their editorial strategy and actually let reporters do what they're meant to do.   It's also difficult because the average person doesn't want hard-hitting investigative journalism. They want content that matches their ideologies. Then you have consumers who are not willing to pay for news and newspapers then rely on clicks which come from entertainment or click-bait articles. It's all such a gross system and I'm looking forward to future innovations in the field."

We are from all different backgrounds and the age range is I think something like 22-37 (don't quote me on that). Each month one person has total discretion in picking a book. We have read fiction and nonfiction...its just whatever the person wants us to read that month. Some of the books we've read this past year are: We Need to Talk About Kevin, The Devil in the White City, The Road, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, The Rook, Ishmael, and Persepolis.   This cookout is really just an opportunity for this rascally group of people to get together without discussing a book and for new people who might be interested to meet us without having to read a book.   In addition to /u/pixsix222, feel free to PM me if you have any questions."

Denver,3dfgfo,WordsPicturesWords,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that is good advice. I'm always reluctant to hit up CL because I literally don't know anything about bikes or what would be good for me."
Denver,3dfgfo,MrChowHoFun,3,Thu Jul 16 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"Make sure the brakes work, the wheels aren't wobbly and that it shifts.  Afterwords you can take it to a bike shop for a quick overhaul if it needs it."
Denver,3dfgfo,hardlyimportant,3,Thu Jul 16 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"If you truly know nothing about bikes, be careful of buying a bike off of Craigslist. Over the past several weeks,  I just spent a lot of time looking  through bikes in the Denver area posted on CL and what you will get for 150 posted price are generally in pretty rough shape. Most bikes in that price range are going to be either from around the 80s or started out on the cheaper end. Most are going to need an immediate tune up which will run you around 75 to 125 at a bike shop. Sitting around and not getting used is not easy on a bike.  Also think about what style of bike you want and riding position. Will  you comfortable being more forward(ie leaned over) or do you want a more upright position? 2 miles is not a long ride but if you are uncomfortable on the bike you get, you are less  likely to use it. Even if you are not going to buy a bike from a bike store, swing by one and try out different styles.  Regardless of what you get make sure you are going to be comfortable riding it day to day, and the maintenance required to keep it running will be manageable for you.   Edit: This is not meant to discourage you from using Craigslist, just educate yourself a little before you go out there, know what you want, and understand what your potential total cost is going to be."

Denver,3dfgfo,jrjohnstone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:51 2015 UTC,Have you been inside the bike depot? (Is this the one in park hill?) They sell bikes that they've put together or rebuilt at various prices too. We bought our kids' bikes there when we used to live a few blocks away. The folks inside are pretty laid back. You should just ask what kind of options they might have for you and maybe you can volunteer time in exchange for a deal or discount.
Denver,3dfgfo,COMplex_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:02:52 2015 UTC,I've been informed that the program is designed for disadvantaged youth to gain a bike. I think I'll check out the store and talk to the employees about purchasing a bike since I am gainfully employed.

I've never seen they ask for income verification, but in the end, they are a nonprofit. However, they have a great used bike retail portion which I've seen great bikes around 300 and they have a lot of project bikes at varying prices. Just call and talk to them."

Its hip, its ""oh lets go to the -metal- bar"", it is a novelty that they are selling with their beer. It is comparable to saying Denver is an artistic city, because of all of the 'art districts'. Hell ive even seen parts of west colfax called an art district,  simply because it is near RMCAD. And you know whats on that part of Colfax?  Car dealerships.   If everywhere is considered an art district, nothing truly is one. Same with bars, i see more metal heads at places like Streets of London, or other shitty dive bars, than i do at the actual 'metal bars'.  That said: Black Sky > Trve"

Denver,3dfhhv,fingerrockets,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:57 2015 UTC,Who is this festival for? Is this targeting young 20 somethings or 40 year olds? Many of those head liners were at their prime in the early to mid 90's. Don't get me wrong I love a number of these acts but I'm almost 40 what does the average 20 year old think of  Iggy Pop? Even with GZA performing Liquid Swords! can not get me to stand in a crowd for four hours to see that and that's saying something because I still pretty much know every word from that album 20 years later.

A lot of decent acts I like, but no one I'd go out of my way to see.  Someone pointed out a groupon for $50 though which seems more than reasonable.  Nice of op to give everyone a heads up too.  I'd go, but I just spent money on Rush Saturday, Smashing Pumpkins Monday, Foo Fighters in August, a festival Tool is playing at in Phoenix in a few months, and probably a bunch of shows I'm not thinking of right now."

Denver,3d9bfw,ZeYetiMon,4,Tue Jul 14 18:35:21 2015 UTC,Thanks Denver Post. You've made me find out how to turn AdBlock on while using Incognito.
Denver,3d9bfw,yewdontknowjack,0,Tue Jul 14 15:04:10 2015 UTC,What exactly is the value of incognito on a home computer?  Can't you just clear your browser history?
Denver,3d9bfw,gitesy,5,Wed Jul 15 00:45:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, u/taylorswiftfan123 here for Incognito, the greatest creation from Google Chrome© since Google Chrome! With a few quick clicks, you can turn your favorite web browser into a personal gateway into the darkest depths of your sexuality! You might be saying ""well u/taylorswiftfan123, why should I use incognito if I can simply clear my browser history?"". Great question, and I personally have an embarrassing amount of experience in this matter, so come with me on a journey of discovery.   You'll be pleased to know that Incognito comes with an added sense of security. We've all been there, you are at your college library, wasting time on your laptop. Your attractive classmate Becky comes over to say hi. Unsure if you cleared your browser history the night before, you are stuck sitting there, staring at a Reddit page. As Becky begins to look towards your screen, you panic. You don't want her to see you on Reddit, you are more sophisticated than that. But will typing a few letters in the browser to escape reveal any of the disgusting porn sites you were on the night before? You can't be sure. If you had just used Incognito, your dumbass might not be in this mess. Hell, you coulda hit it off with Becky and got married. Instead you are sitting there like an idiot staring at another AskReddit thread about mindfuck movies, while Becky leaves to go flirt with Brad. Damn.  If you still aren't sold, there is an even better and more serious reason to use Google Chrome's Incognito. PFSADS or Post-Fap Shame and Depression Syndrome is a clinically diagnosable condition that affects men and women the world over. In normal web browsers, every time you click on your history tab to clear it, there will be a long list waiting for you of all the fucked up shit you watched. The last thing you need after a long session of self love is a reminder of all the depraved videos that got you there. You already have enough self inflicted shame, so why should your web browser add any more? With Incognito just close the window and put your fap behind you. No shameful reminders necessary.  So next time you are feeling like feeling yourself, do it with the state of mind that Incognito provides. This is u/taylorswiftfan123 signing out with Google Chrome's Incognito. Goodnight everyone."

Since you want adventure and experience to improve your film-making skills, try climbing a ""14ner"".  Colorado is famous for it's fourteeners (mountains that are 14,000 ft. or taller), in fact Colorado has the most 14ners in the U.S.  For you and your buddy, I suggest doing Grays Peak/Torrys Peak and Mt. Evans/Mt. Bierstadt. These are the closes to Denver and some of the easiest, but take note, as the saying goes, ""no fourteener is an easy fourteener"". Also, make sure you guys get there early. Since you and your buddy are from San Diego and thus sea-level, it might take you guys much of the entire day to climb them.

They're disgorging a bunch of septic gas and it smells fucking terrible.   But yeah if this guy is blaming fans for puking and pissing past the railings on either side, in a season where we've had incredible amounts of rain, he's fucking delusional. I've lived in CO for 3 or 4 years and I've smelled the shit stink at RR at a dozen shows at least. Usually in lower south. Employees have consistently said something about the septic setup for the venue.   I'm persistently incredulous that someone actually pays Ricardo Baca to write. If I write an article about piss covered toilet seats in a bar I wonder if reverb will publish it.   What an absolutely piece of shit article. God dammit, this guy gets to me.

(And I thought the first /r/Denver rule says it's 'a welcoming, friendly place,' ha.) But it's all good. I realize I was putting myself out there when I wrote it. I don't post on reddit a ton, but I did want to chime in briefly. As others here have said: 'It was horrible.' 'The smelly stairs.' 'He's not wrong.' 'Def a stench.' As I said in the column: It's only the stairs and the stage-right restrooms. Not anywhere else in the venue. What I didn't say in the column (that I've since learned): The smell is likely weather related. Sunday was hot, and the smell was severe. On an overcast or rainy day, it wouldn't be as prominent. I didn't tell people they shouldn't go or that they should hate on the venue. In fact I said the opposite; Red Rocks is too great to be treated like a toilet. As for the rage sweat-inducing self-gratification of my background, I'm sorry to hear it came off that way. The point of that 'terribly written sentence:' To let people know that I've spent enough time on those stairs to say they've never smelled worse in my experience. So I'll leave it at that.

Denver,3daqs9,dindenver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yes I was the SJG rep at Bonnie for the past year and a half and was very sad to see them close. What happened was that the building that they were in was bought out and the new owners wanted to use the top floor (which I guess is a really cool ballroom) and in order to do so they needed the space that Bonnie Brae was in so the new owner did not renew the lease for BBHS. They looked and looked for a new location but didn't find one they could afford. Their last hope was a place that was all but signed. Before the closing deal, the owners looked what it was that BBHS sold and saw all of the ""evil"" things that was in the shop. I'm guessing they saw some D&D stuff and freaked out or maybe some BONES miniatures.  As to your other question, I have both of those games including two expansions for Illuminati. I have never actually played Car Wars but If that's what is called for I can figure it out between now and then. If those games are not what is chosen and you would like to play them still, just let me know. I can invite you out some time or if you have a group that normally plays I can come to you and do a private demo for any of the SJG I have. Just let me know!"

Denver,3dbpw8,BigFeet5,4,Wed Jul 15 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"First: Check your lease and see if you can sublet and whether you need your LL's approval.  If not, go forth and sublet!  You will remain liable on the lease to the LL through expiration.  if you have to get their approval, do that.  Second:  If you cannot sublet, I would bet money that there is language in your lease that allows you to get out if you present a ""worthy"" renter to take you place.  In this instance, you aren't subletting, you'd be terminating your lease early while Person B starts their own lease.  There will usually be penalties/fees associated with this, but they tend to be less than straight out breaking your lease.  Upside is you don't remain liable.    Talk honestly with your LL.  In this rental market, I doubt your place would be vacant long.  I moved here from Seattle three months ago with one month left on my lease.  We did an ""Early Key Return"" and had to pay the rent for the final month before we left, but they ended up leasing it almost immediately, and I got all my money back. It worked out perfectly."
Denver,3dbpw8,jgonz85,3,Wed Jul 15 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"You're gonna have to read your lease.  It should be in there.  If there is no mention then you should be OK. (but look for terms like non-assignable)  But in general if you do, you are still responsible for all costs and charges.  This includes rent and damages."
Denver,3dbpw8,chasonreddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:22:20 2015 UTC,And if so OP should familiarize themselves with assignment vs. sublease. If I was OP I would want to make sure the company can collect directly from the new tenant. Sometimes people are crazy unreliable with rent.
Denver,3dbpw8,yeradolt,3,Wed Jul 15 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"Any good lease probably won't let you.  It can be a huge issue.  Such as:   Person 1 signs lease Person 2 promises to pay person 1 Person 2 doesn't pay person 1 Person 1 can't pay rent Person 2 isn't in trouble, Person 1 is. Their name is on lease.   Doubt they will let you for three months.  One approach, but a gamble, be honest and tell them about your life changes and offer to open the apartment up for showing early, and be ready to move out on a dime's notice.  You're legally responsible to pay if they say no, or if no one claims the unit, but with ~96% occupancy rate in Denver they can probably re-rent it."
Denver,3d7xv5,Livingthedream_,20,Tue Jul 14 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it in the survey but the city should also make incentives for more desirable shops.  The Ross, Walgreens,  and hooky gift shops are not going to attract families.  Unique shops, Unique restaurants, and stores like The Wizards Chest would be better (Tattered cover is a good retailer to have along the mall - and that area is better).  How about more cafe's, coffee shops, and a few galleries?   If you want families - how about a few areas redesigned into playgrounds where kids can climb things?    There should also be different and better lighting.  There needs to be a LOT more bicycle infrastructure - and that includes parking. If I ride my bike to your business - I need a safe place to lock it!   How about incentives for people that DO ride to businesses.

As a non-bike rider, bikes eliminate 1/2 of the doors to the train, both ends of the cars generally have bikes and I have to get on in the middle 2 doors.  Not the end of the world, just kind of a pain.  For bikers- I see bikers try to get on, see there is no room for them, then try to run to the other end of the car to try and get on, just to see that's full, and miss the train.  Or worse- carry their bike on to a non-bike door.  It's a lose-lose all around."

Among my coworkers who ride to work the consensus is that downtown is not worth going near on a bike. It also means that people won't ride 'across' downtown, which keeps people from neighboring areas from biking through downtown to City Park or something. It's like a roadblock for cyclists.

Denver,3d7xv5,CSCrimson,17,Tue Jul 14 13:29:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind them banning panhandling on the Mall. I am an amateur musician and regularly go down there to busk with my friends. We regularly get a great response from the folks passing by down there about our music.   However we also regularly get threatened by gangs of homeless people if we inadvertently step on 'their' panhandling spot. I do feel for people in that situation but they are just allowed to panhandle there just like we are allowed to play music there. It's nobody's right yet many homeless people will belligerently defend 'their' spots as if it is. If the panhandlers can't be stopped from causing trouble I think they should just ban it on the mall. Interestingly enough pan handlers on Pearl St. Mall are just as numerous but way more chill and friendly.
Denver,3d7xv5,skesisfunk,12,Tue Jul 14 20:32:30 2015 UTC,"Busking, especially street magic and music like what you guys do, is one of the better aspects of the mall.  The fact that you have been threatened by groups of homeless people about ""prime real estate"" so to speak, is a good example of just how much of a problem there is."
Denver,3d7xv5,JingJang,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:01 2015 UTC,Colorado Springs one good idea for the decade was cracking down on panhandling while allowing street musicians on Tejon.
Denver,3d7xv5,mojobytes,6,Thu Jul 16 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"I would also like to see them kick the solicitors off the mall or issue a finite/smaller number of licenses or something. It just get's old getting barraged by 10 different people when you're just trying to get to work or to lunch. If their goal is for people to have a nice experience there they need to do something about it.  Yeah, most of the time I just ignore solicitors. However, some are more aggressive than others and you're also having to dodge/ignore 10 of them on a 3 block stretch.  I think street performances, some light panhandling (as in you sit there with a sign) and food carts/trailers are totally fine and dandy, and they add to the atmosphere of the street. I just think the aggressive behavior of a lot of the solicitors and homeless panhandling gangs on that street are ruining it for everyone."
Denver,3d7xv5,antisyzygy,12,Wed Jul 15 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"totally agree that the homeless population is incredible in downtown and it gets worse on the weekend. They wonder why we don't window shop, well if you do you are running the risk of being harassed by the homeless. The best way to get through the mall is to just look forward and walk fast."

Denver,3d7xv5,Duckbilling,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:17:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather hang out on Colfax at this point. The food on 16th isn't worth the trouble anymore. They should get rid of the fast food (especially that gross McDonalds). I think that would clean up some of the vagrants.
Denver,3d7xv5,PlattFish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:54 2015 UTC,I think they should dress them up like wizards!
Denver,3d7xv5,Duckbilling,8,Fri Jul 17 17:08:59 2015 UTC,An out of town friend was threatened with a knife just the other day on the mall. It's getting nuts there. I generally tell people to avoid it.
Denver,3d7xv5,Sne4kyWomb4t,-11,Tue Jul 14 13:37:18 2015 UTC,"This post is just so depressing to me. Yes homelessness is a problem in Denver and around the country. Of course they gravitate toward densely populated areas, retail areas - because that is where people with money spend their time. Where do you propose they go? I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be ok with them pitching a tent in your Highlands Ranch back yard (probably wouldn't go over too well with your nice HOA either).    The main thing that I would like to see changed on 16th street mall and commons park is the amount of malicious vagrants.   The majority of them are not malicious. Sure they look scruffy and smell a little weird but they shouldn't be characterized as malicious for that. I used to work in a law firm down by 16th Street and would get asked for some kind of help (food, money, work, housing etc) constantly but it was never anything more than that. If I said 'no' they would go back to their spot along the wall without much further comment, if I gave them something they were always very appreciative and never asked for more than what I gave. Are you going to have one here and there that can get a little too aggressive probably - in my 6 months of being down there everyday I never did - sure but at the same time it's a fucking city crime is going to happen whether it's a homeless person or just someone looking to get something for nothing it's going to happen. I just ask that you please don't lump all homeless people into one sub-category of criminally violent/malicious vagrants because the vast majority are not and are just trying to get by as honestly as they can.   Your post makes the homeless sound like they aren't human at worst and second class citizens at best. Help the homeless organizations are so limited in what they can do whether it's because they are limited in number of volunteers/volunteer hours or a fiscal/resource limitation. So maybe if everyone would give up a 'Sunday Funday' now and then to physically pitch in and help that would slowly ease some of their 'negative impact'. Homeless shelters only provide housing for overnight (and some aren't open in the summer because our weather is nice enough they can sleep outside somewhere and not risk death) - these people have to go somewhere during the day - where do you propose they go? Not to mention that so often is the case the shelters that are operational hit their capacity and are forced to turn people away. Which is why most shelters have rules like you must be sober of any kind of substance, willing to participate in mentorship programs, etc. Donating clothes, money to church organization etc helps but it is in no way going to solve the problem.  From the content of your post you aren't looking for a real solution to this problem you're just a NIMBY (not in my back yard).  Sometimes you've got to get that nicely manicured hand a little dirty doing work to fix something. And speaking of throwing money at a problem - our cities budget is stretched so thin assistant programs can only help so much and people get their panties in a real twist any time someone even whispers a tax increase. So you (and in this instance I don't mean you you I mean you people in general) don't want to pay more in taxes that would help this problem yet you don't want to see them when you have your nice clean family outings because explaining to your kids that some people don't have nice homes and dinners is uncomfortable. You can't have it both ways. Or at the very least if you're going to bitch about tax rates and petition against them get your ass to a soup kitchen, homeless shelter, habitat for humanity and physically pitch in. You'll be one more person than the day before fighting the cause. It's not going to change it overnight nor will it probably show notice that day but if you keep going, encouraging others to help it creates a domino effect and slowly but surely that is how headway is made on issues like this.   TL;DR: Treat homeless people as actual people and things will go much smoother. For the majority of homeless people they are not violent or criminals they are just doing what they have to try and get by. They have to go somewhere and they tend to gravitate toward densely populated areas. You don't like them then start actively researching ways to help."
Denver,3d7xv5,ColoradoThinMint,7,Tue Jul 14 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"Homelessness is a problem that needs policy solutions (free housing to homeless is cheaper than leaving them on the streets, for example). I don't think people being nicer about the homeless will solve the root cause here."
Denver,3d7xv5,fryburglar,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:32:47 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily mean be nicer I mean volunteer and help the cause rather than just complain that it negatively impacted a family outting.
Denver,3d7xv5,ColoradoThinMint,3,Wed Jul 15 00:19:30 2015 UTC,Why would you presume people don't do both? I can want people to get help and volunteer time and money and be annoyed that I fear my wife and her friends will get stabbed if they respond the wrong way to a mentally I'll homeless person.
Denver,3d7xv5,dustlesswalnut,4,Wed Jul 15 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that they are people and I am super nice to all of them. But the number that are belligerent and aggressive is increasing. It seems we are importing homeless from out of town. My son is afraid of them no matter how much I expose him to normal city life. There has to be a better way. 16th st is getting perceived as a smelly homeless ridden part of town and that's bad, we can do better we are growing up as a city and we need to do better."

Denver,3d7xv5,ShoebarusNCheverlegs,2,Tue Jul 14 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"I can support homeless programs, donate to charities, and vote for people that will work for positive changes for the homeless and at the same time complain that I dont feel safe walking through the 16th street mall at night when it's 40% dirty, disheveled people babbling nonsense and accosting my wife and I for money.  I don't want to get stabbed, and I don't want you to get stabbed, and the unfortunate truth is that most of those homeless people have untreated mental illnesses and their behavior is not predicable."
Denver,3d7xv5,dustlesswalnut,0,Wed Jul 15 02:10:40 2015 UTC,I admit that they are unpredictable but at the same time I think of it in terms of pit bulls. They have a social stigma for being aggressive and dangerous but the majority of them if treated right are actually pretty great dogs (please don't take this as I am comparing homeless people to dogs that is not at all what my example is trying to do). Sure you're going to have one or two that are just aggressive but the majority of them get a bum rap because of a few bad apples - same applies there are a few overly aggressive homeless people in the grand scheme of the population that give them the negative rap. And I will admit I do not spend a great amount of time on 16th after dark usually no later than 9PM so it may be a completely different population than what I am used to encountering in the daylight hours.
Denver,3d7xv5,ColoradoThinMint,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"I love pit bulls, and all dogs. But if the 16th street mall had several hundred stray, dirty dogs milling around at night and 1% of them were rabid and attacked people I'd say the same thing about them as the homeless.  Does it really matter if 95% are fine if you're being stabbed and mugged by the other 5%, and there's no way to tell the difference between them?"
Denver,3d7xv5,dustlesswalnut,3,Wed Jul 15 02:49:24 2015 UTC,"I remember when the 16th Street Mall was awesome with Sharper Image and Brookstone, and sweet art galleries and good restaurants. Changing that over to office space/school space was an unfortunate choice."
Denver,3d7xv5,dicky834,11,Tue Jul 14 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think that the /r/Denver community is not the target demographic of 16th St mall though.  People forget that it is a mall.

Denver,3d7xv5,JingJang,-3,Tue Jul 14 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  When cities become prosperous, the monoculture often associated with suburbia (national chains, mall-like retail) takes over a portion of a city, and the local vibe that was there moves elsewhere on the city where rents are lower. It's whack-a-mole.  Same thing happened in DC. First Georgetown got malled (in terms of retailers that moved on, not street configuration), so culture switched to Old Town Alexandria, and after that got malled, then places like Del Ray Alexandria and U Street DC. And that's just what it was when I left on 2006 - don't know the current status.  There's also an elephant in the room here - an envy of Boulder's Pearl Street Mall. Pearl Street is by far the most successful pedestrian mall in the country, and experts are hard pressed to explain its success let alone reduce it to a formula. Denver has a history of envy and insecurity, leading to white elephants such as DIA, the convention center, and slow-running light rail to the exurbs. With less interference and ""planning"", Denver would thrive greater on its assets - its extensive street grid, share of Victorian architecture (that which has survived the wrecking ball of insecurity), tourist dollars, being the largest city in a 1000-mile diameter circle, and 300 days of sunshine."

Denver,3d7xv5,jcfiala,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:53 2015 UTC,Boulder also doesn't have the homeless and lower class population that Denver has to deal with. Comparing Boulder to Denver is comical.
Denver,3d7xv5,thehappyheathen,2,Wed Jul 15 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"The Pearl Street mall has several massive differences from the 16th Street mall. They have an awesome bus line that connects it to campus, neighborhoods on the Hill, and the 29th Street mall (the Hop). There's lots of bike parking, and there is a bike path really close to the mall. There's a nice park that draws crowds with festivals and a farmer's market. And finally, the Pearl Street mall is clean and accented with planters, seating and art that integrates into the environment. The Pearl Street mall is purpose built to appeal to pedestrians.  By comparison, the 16th Street mall is kinda a bus route, kinda a shopping center and kinda a cluttered patio for very large buildings."
Denver,3d7xv5,PlattFish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Pearl street has amazing food, far fewer aggressive vagrants, and doesn't reek like a mix of garbage and weed 24/7. Those things certainly help."

Denver,3dbkd8,SnoYeah,4,Wed Jul 15 00:17:15 2015 UTC,You're wanting to sell a bulk amount all at once?  My suggestion ain't that but I have had the best luck in selling and getting the best price for books on Amazon. Quite a bit more of a hassle with having to wait for the orders to come in and getting them shipped and all that but it brought in the most money by far. Amazon has tools that help you price your books and people will buy them even if yours are not the cheapest option. I often list mine far above the average selling price and they still sell.  Of course it depends on what kind of books you have. And there will be some stragglers that never sell but I just ended up donating them.
Denver,3dbkd8,UnCounted36244,3,Wed Jul 15 01:04:54 2015 UTC,Are you looking to get money for them or just rid of them? Public libraries take donations if you're just looking to get rid of them.

The stone tiling is blasé. The trash bins and flower buckets are bulbous and clumsy, and all scattered haphazardly along the mall. The median is littered with vendor kiosks, eliminating what little park-like feel there is beneath the foliage that exists on the mall would one want to sit on a bench. At night, the lighting is dim, and casts that gross, seamy yellowiness over the mall that makes it feel like Denver's most developed back-alley.  The mall might have been designed by the Louvre architect, but its present-day form seems to have deviated from or obscured much of the initial design elements.  All the scatterbrained kiosk placement as well as the art pieces, pianos, and god knows what other shit's been randomly heaped into the mall for decades needs to be cleared out in exchange for more greenery.

Denver,3d4oaw,yewdontknowjack,8,Mon Jul 13 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see 16th take on more of  the 3rd street promenade in Santa Monica type feel. Good Fast Casual restaurants, good sit down restaurants, trendy shops, tons of entertainers, etc.   16th currently has 2 7-11's, mcdonalds, taco bell, amongst tons of other cheap and bleh type places.   I think you need to up the class, remove the bus and reuse that space for people walking, and just make it more trendy with bars and places people actually want to hang out.   Not to mention the homeless of course... but that's another story I'd say"
Denver,3d4oaw,mattyschnitz,3,Mon Jul 13 21:29:35 2015 UTC,I wish there were more benches and/or chairs and tables along the mall. It'd be easier to people watch that way.
Denver,3d4oaw,NineteenthJester,2,Tue Jul 14 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's great but I don't agree with most of what you've said.  I love the flowers that are around each year. I like that they maintain the stone and it's not just simple concrete or bricks that others use and are harder to maintain.  I like some of the food vendors. Right at Champa/16th is a great flower area that rotates through the year.  I love the way it looks in winter when snow blankets it.  I can understand that at night there are residences so if you keep it super bright it shafts those people.  I love the pianos. Absolutely love them. They are maintained to always be working and are colorful. You seem to dislike all of the things I love about it.  There are performers and musicians that play which I will stop to listen to almost daily on my walks to work and home.  I don't want this to be a forest park. I just don't. When they did the Meet in the Street around July 4th I enjoyed that style but we have City Park nearby and I live across the street with the performing arts center park. I just don't want another park that lines it. I LOVE the pianos and music.  While I'm just one cry as are you I'm glad there might be a voting system on this as I would be very open for change but don't want to remove all of the facets you seem to think are drab.  I have about 3 visitors from out of state a month come visit and they all come back overjoyed about the pianos, musicians, performers, flowers. To simply wipe it because you want another park, of which we have dozens, more than dozens frankly doesn't appeal to me. It's not special."

Denver,3d4oaw,yewdontknowjack,36,Mon Jul 13 14:35:29 2015 UTC,I just love the Green Peace/Planned Parenhood/Save the Children people trying to shake your hand every 1/2 block.

Denver,3d4oaw,seven_seven,5,Tue Jul 14 01:37:01 2015 UTC,Is it still jaywalking if they are crossing the mall? Or do you mean crossing the actual streets when traffic has a green light?
Denver,3d4oaw,COMplex_,4,Mon Jul 13 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Not really sure. I think crossing the mall is okay since they have the median there for use? I can't imagine having to cross using a crosswalk at an intersection, and enter the median from there.  It's the obsessed cell phone use that really gets me. It's a busy street, with lots of buses/cars/trains whizing by trying to get from A to B. I don't want to start the circlejerk I had in a different thread about hitting jaywalkers on their phones while biking. But it's a dangerous place that you need to be aware of all your surroundings, not the staring down at your phone to see what's on Facebook or Reddit."
Denver,3d4oaw,yewdontknowjack,2,Mon Jul 13 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yeah, I definitely agree. As a cyclist as well it seems as if no one pays attention. Drivers, peds, other cyclists... It's a free-for all most days."
Denver,3d4oaw,COMplex_,2,Mon Jul 13 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"3 - The jaywalking tourists on their cell phones   Hey now, it's not just tourists.  Don't forget the droves of suits not paying attention and staring at oncoming traffic when they have the balls to honk at them."
Denver,3d4oaw,dueljester,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:22:17 2015 UTC,"I moved out of Denver 8 years ago and I am curious, how long has the 16th street mall been seen this way? I remember everyone using it as a place to meet up downtown and use the shuttle to go somewhere like Leela's or Wynkoop Brewery, which are right off the mall. Has it actually changed or is it just viewed differently now?"
Denver,3d4oaw,elbeanodeldino,8,Tue Jul 14 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see them use the space seasonally and effectively. They had a little Christmas market set up nearby this past winter. I lingered around for a little bit because of that. It would also make a nice spot for a farmer's market or a full blown open air market like you see in other countries. I dunno, I think it has potential, but I also don't think the Mall Ride is the problem. The problem is that the things on the mall are so generic. A Walgreens or a Famous Footwear instead of a ski shop or a Mellow Mushroom instead of a brewpub. There's no character."
Denver,3d4oaw,thehappyheathen,23,Mon Jul 13 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"Better shops, better restaurants, better bars, throw in some clubs and you are good to go. 16th Mall SHOULD be such a cool aspect of Denver but it falls short in almost every aspect. I never tell people visiting to go there. Market street is doing something right but thats about it."
Denver,3d4oaw,zeblackun,6,Mon Jul 13 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"Market and Blake between 18th and 22nd is miles away better than anything they'll accomplish on 16th Street.  Hell, I don't even like going to Larimer Square anymore, which used to be one of my favorite places downtown."

Denver,3d4oaw,y3llow5ub,16,Mon Jul 13 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're looking for.  First of all, avoid the area like the plague on Friday and Saturday nights unless you're the kind of person that likes frat parties.  If that is actually your thing, pick any bar in that area on those nights.  It's a whole different world the rest of the week.   The Armoury shows Game of Thrones live (during the season) on Sunday nights. Mexico City Lounge has the most amazing tacos ever made. You can actually smoke a cigar or a cigarette while having a drink at the same time inside of a bar at Delaney's.   The Whiskey Bar has a ton of whiskey drinks. The Star Bar has a ton of rotating craft brews on tap. The Retro Room has vodka infused with everything from apples to zucchini.  (if you like dill pickle juice, try the pickle vodka).  And you can get a haircut there (it's also a full salon), too while drinking your cocktail, if that's your thing. Ian's pizza has what I've heard best described as ""stoner pizza.""  It's new york style, but they have toppings you won't find anywhere else (or just plain pepperoni if that's your thing).  I like the taco pizza. 1-UP on non-weekends is fun if you like old arcade games. Southern Hospitality has absolutely amazing southern food. The Keg is a pretty good high end chain steak joint.  As is the Denver Chophouse. Falling Rock has a metric fuckton of beers on tap. Biker Jim's has absolutely amazing ridiculous hot dogs. (Reindeer hot dogs?  sign me up!) Summit Music Hall occasionally gets some interesting bands (local and regional). Zanzibar has free pool all of the time on regulation size tables. El Chapultepec has live Jazz. Trillium has acceptable Norwegian food. We finally got a butcher shop called Butcher's Bistro (which is also a bar with amazing meat dishes). Snooze is an amazing place for breakfast (do not attempt to go there on weekend mornings unless you are ok waiting for a while). Broncos games at absolutely any bar in the area are a full on production.   And all of this is in basically a 4 block radius."

I've barely lived here a year but I've been trying to visit almost everywhere. Huge fan of Work & Class (might not be in the same district but probably my fave place here so far) and Vine Street Brewery and Chop Shop."

Denver,3d4oaw,Kactus_Karma,0,Mon Jul 13 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"It won't happen because parking near Linger is free, and parking downtown is fucking expensive as hell (considering most Linger-y dinners will take longer than the mandated 2 hour max at most downtown meters)."
Denver,3d4oaw,Jackalopecia,11,Mon Jul 13 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"The point is that local businesses would attract people to spend more time on 16th street. Like you said, parking is expensive so why pay for it when I can go to the same restaurants/retail in some strip center in Littleton?"

It has a small population of continuosly drunk people, being loud and belligerent.  I have gone down to the mall occasionaly, had a reasonable meal that was overpriced for the food.  Pearl Street in Boulder is much more interesting with the Art stores."

Denver,3d4oaw,themadnooch,11,Mon Jul 13 14:37:18 2015 UTC,They have taken over this area across the clock tower near Biker Jim's cart. It's very annoying but man I've seen some interesting stuff. Lots of bums blackout drunk at 1:30 PM who literally can't walk and other small fights.

Denver,3d4oaw,WorkSux456,11,Tue Jul 14 21:17:24 2015 UTC,Tourists end up here all the time and I'm not quite sure why. There really isn't anything here that is unique to Denver. 16th st tries to be a cultural hub of Denver and fails. It tries to be a shopping destination for visitors and fails. Either go all out and make it a regional shopping destination or let food trucks and food carts move in and put in clubs and restaurants and make it a late night destination - Denver's version of Miami's South Beach? It would be great if you could take a bus going back and forth to different clubs. It would be tough to separate it from LoDo though. Keeping the bros out would be a real struggle.
Denver,3d4oaw,COMplex_,7,Mon Jul 13 15:57:56 2015 UTC,I'd take bros over bums any day of the week. Actually... Now that I wrote that out I'm not so sure.

Ohhhhh and the construction going on every night of the week repairing the tiles that the buses were not made to ride on. Some of the worst potholes in town are where the mall intersects other streets. Get rid of the free bum armpit ride please denver."

Denver,3d4oaw,situational_analysis,10,Mon Jul 13 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"Just like DenverITGuy and yewdontknowjack said. Why are they ignoring the obvious low hanging fruit problems and going after the much harder to get problems? Restructure the entire bus system in Denver for one street or get rid of the bums and hagglers? Lets redo the entire bus system, yeah thats the ticket!  Looking at the big picture they are probably right though. Remove the free ride to 16th and you will remove the people that are only there because they got a free ride. Thinking about 16th street being like Pearl street in Boulder actually makes me slightly excited about it being cool some day. If the people using the bus system aren't staying on the mall they don't care that its dropping them off at the mall. Moving them over a block isn't going to make much difference to them but it might actually make a difference for the mall. My parents and some friends from Germany were in town this weekend. They asked about 16th street mall, said they wanted to walk around downtown and check stuff out. I warned them to stay away from 16th because it is so terrible and not a great example of Denver to show people from out of town. Thats a shame."

The problem is that there isn't any low hanging fruit. Sure, some people aren't going to like going somewhere that there's homeless people, but they have no way of verifying that's making any noticeable impact on the people choosing not to linger. Now, if they survey a couple thousand people and ""homeless people"" comes back as the top answer for why people don't hang around, then there might be a point, but otherwise it's just conjecture.   Apart from that, what could they do about it? It's a public area and you can hardly put loitering laws into effect when you're hoping to induce people to loiter."
Denver,3d4oaw,ParadoxPenis,11,Mon Jul 13 17:12:44 2015 UTC,I don't think you need to take a survey to confirm that people don't like hanging out where there are tons of homeless people and you are getting asked for money every 10 feet.

Furthermore, unless you are singling out a protected class of people, it is absolutely legal to plan to have higher enforcement of certain laws in certain places.  For example, you may be familiar with DUI checkpoints. A checkpoint is a decision by the police department to focus on enforcement of a specific law in a specific area. It would be just as legal to decide to ramp up enforcement on the mall for certain laws."
Denver,3d4oaw,COScout,0,Mon Jul 13 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"What? All laws are selectively enforced. That doesn't make it profiling.    That's literally the definition of profiling.    profiling1 — noun   The use of personal characteristics or behavior patterns to make generalizations about a person, as in gender profiling . The use of these characteristics to determine whether a person may be engaged in illegal activity, as in racial profiling ."
Denver,3d4oaw,ParadoxPenis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Wonderful, you've just defined any and all policework as profiling. What a useful definition!"

Denver,3d4oaw,bigweekendburt,0,Mon Jul 13 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yep that's why I called it ""unfair"" policing.  But bums drunk at noon on a workday harassing people for change is different than otherwise productive members of society getting loaded and walking home after a night on the town.  Different situations call for different enforcement.  I'd imagine both are breaking the law  in Denver, so if one is causing a stir and the other isn't, how can the police be blamed for profiling?  If Mr. Friday Night starts a fight or is caught with his pants down pissing in the bushes the cops would (and should) have a few words w/ him too."

I think you and I have different definitions of being harassed. I've almost never had someone ask for money, or speak to me in general (with the exception of the guy who likes to make up rhymes about what you're wearing) but I do see plenty of people with signs, but I hardly consider that harassing.   Also, apart from being illegal, selectively enforcing a law to target only a certain group of people is morally wrong. Not only that, but having the police go after them does nothing to solve the underlying problem. If these people are really bothering you this much, why not lobby the city/state to follow Salt Lake City's lead. They successfully reduced the homeless population dramatically and saved money by just building some decent apartments and allowing the homeless to use them for free. That seems like a win-win to me."

Denver,3d4oaw,080805,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:22 2015 UTC,Yep. But they won't be arrested or written a citation for public drunkenness. In other words there is no public drunkenness law. If there was a public drunkenness law there wouldn't be any drunk bums shambling around.   Good luck getting cops to chase down and put bums in the drunk tank when there's no revenue generated.

Even if it isn't a money maker; realistically how many bums would pay even if there was a fine?  It'll take political pressure and a public that won't go batshit over the government ""being cruel to the people who need help the most.""  Yet tolerating this kind of behavior only encourages it, so why not make it more difficult?"
Denver,3d4oaw,timeismonkey,4,Wed Jul 15 13:41:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I only use the mall for the bus to get to the Walgreens pharmacy. I always tell out of towners to avoid 16th st because it's embarrassing. I was picking up a prescription on Friday at 5pm-ish and it's a mess at 16th and Stout. It was nice to see the 2 police cars and 2 bikes but it's sad it is necessary. There were bums slumped over everywhere in the chairs, people begging, hippie kids with their dogs and backpacking packs asking for money, and people running across traffic. Why would you want people to walk up and down that?  I would love for 16th to be like Pearl St. Even though it's weird in it's own way. A good way though."
Denver,3d4oaw,InfiniteChicken,5,Mon Jul 13 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"16th Street Mall is one of the worst places in Denver because they've curated and nurtured it into a safe, corporate tourist hub while trying to maintain it as a natural cultural corridor. People have tried to do independent things on the mall and been forced out in favor of the same brands and experiences you can get in any other urban tourist district. Yet everyone downtown winds up there because of the Mall Ride access. So it feels simultaneously bland and trashy. Such an ongoing wasted opportunity to showcase local culture.  But, on the plus side, where that Venn diagram of ""People Who Love Shopping Malls"" and ""People Who Love Gross Alleyways"" intersect, there's some happy folks."

But now that you make me consider personal safety—yeah. That's one of the safest places (except perhaps after 2am) in Denver, it's crawling with cops and ambassadors. Gross doesn't equal unsafe. You might smell urine or be hollered at, but you're probably more likely to get mugged or hurt on 15th or 17th where there's less police presence. I say this having lived and worked in central downtown for decades. 16th's awfulness isn't because it's gross, but because it's full of chains and boardroom planning and nothing authentic about Denver. Actually, the grossness might be the most authentic part."

Denver,3d31u8,Beerquarium,4,Mon Jul 13 14:18:53 2015 UTC,"Those do not look like single exposure shots.

Denver,3d31u8,tehphil,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"Well I think multiple exposures is still necessary if there is too much contrast between the foreground and background.  Making it looking too HDR during processing is another discussion.  In the case of these pictures, the foreground was dark to the naked eye, while the sky was filled with stars and visible milky way.  It was still within acceptable contrast range to allow a single exposure to work.  I also used my headlights to spill some light onto the foreground.  In the photo showing the lit up mountains (with me in the lower left), I was also aided by some oncoming traffic lights, the distance headlights was sufficient to light up the entire mountain face..."

Denver,3d31u8,_horsey,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:50 2015 UTC,You probably could have turned the ISO down a few notches and increased exposure time a bit to reduce the noise in the foreground. Star trails don't really appear at 24mm until about 30s. Worth trying next time at least since you're getting some awesome foreground compositions like that Subaru shot.

Denver,3d73zs,Waves_of_awesome,6,Tue Jul 14 01:19:19 2015 UTC,Wait.   How.  How is a private individual enacting legal stature like RICO
Denver,3d73zs,LaughingAtIdiots,2,Tue Jul 14 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's legal.  According to Wikipedia for RICO:   When the U.S. Attorney decides to indict someone under RICO, he or she has the option of seeking a pre-trial restraining order or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant's assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a performance bond. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of Mafia-related shell corporations often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict.   BUT - the US Attorney isn't the only one:   RICO also permits a private individual ""damaged in his business or property"" by a ""racketeer"" to file a civil suit. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an ""enterprise"". The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same.[3] There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise ""through"" the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)).[4] In essence, the enterprise is either the 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' or 'perpetrator' of the racketeers.[5] A civil RICO action can be filed in state or federal court.[6]   Both the criminal and civil components allow the recovery of treble damages (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages).  So the lawsuits aren't going to get anyone jail time unless the US Attorney files, but they can seek damages. Money. The thing the Pot Industry has tons of."

This is largely 'legal blackmail' from my understanding. A lawsuit against a company of any type is bad news. Add the cannabis industry, I bet it spooked a lot of people involved.

Gave her co-worker the keys and said ""its the blue Subaru Outback"". Well since there are around a half-million blue Subaru Outbacks in Denver her co-worker ended up getting in the wrong car and for some reason the key actually worked. He drove the (technically stolen) car on a 20 minute errand and when he came back parked it across the street from where it was originally parked. He adjusted the seat, changed the radio station, probably adjusted the mirrors too. It wasn't until later that they pieced together what happened.

Denver,3d56n2,iamacontrarian,63,Mon Jul 13 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"I am going to be straight about this, DeviatedNorm is wrong. Coors field in my opinion is almost entirely  responsible for revitalizing LoDo and surrounding areas (at least as a place to ""hang out"" or live). There was nothing in that part of town besides empty buildings, homeless, train tracks, etc. basically a place you never wanted to go or would go. Downtown in general was a place no one went to except for office work. The stadium brought people to the area in a casual sense. More people meant people started investing in restaurants and bars. More restaurants and bars soon turned LoDo into a place that people wanted to actually live. More demand for housing meant more development. You see where I am going with this. Even if ""20 years -- an entire generation"" to revitalize, so what? That doesn't make it not true. I think that makes it even more powerful that the building of baseball stadium is still having a chain reaction in a positive way today."
Denver,3d56n2,ChickenTaco,7,Mon Jul 13 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that cut and dry. There was real momentum in LoDo before Coors field. The Lower Downtown District was formed in 1988. Wynkoop brewery, along with several other bars, restaurants and event a night club had been open for years by the time the first game was played in Coors field.  Now that isn't to say Coors field wasn't very important to the whole process. It certainly was. It for sure threw a bunch of gas on the fire.   It would be really interesting to go back in time, get rid of Coors field, and see how LoDo might be different today. It's really hard to know.. I imagine there'd be fewer bars at the very least."

Denver,3d56n2,MotionDrive,3,Tue Jul 14 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"I think Coors field is a different situation than what Oliver was talking about.  The idea that teams need a NEW stadium, to replace an existing one, is almost always a waste of money.  In the case of Coors, there wasnt a baseball team here, there wasnt a bar district in the area, there really wasnt much of anything like there is today. So it pretty clear that virtually all development that has happened can be directly tied back to the stadium."
Denver,3d56n2,erickssm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"True, but I think the John Oliver piece was highlighting this recent trend in unnecessarily demolishing and rebuilding existing stadiums, and billing the taxpayers. Coors Field was different because the Rockies were moving in for the first time.   Now if they were saying that Coors Field is outdated, and the city needs to fund a new, $800m stadium or else the Rockies are going to move to Cheyenne or something, then it would be a similar issue. There's no question that bringing sports teams into a city can revitalize the area in which the team operates. Like you said, people had no reason to go to LoDo before the Rockies moved in. However, a new stadium for the existing team wouldn't revitalize the area any more.  Also, sometimes this strategy backfires; sometimes stadiums built in blighted areas do not revitalize the area, and people only go to the area to see the games and then they get the fuck out. I think it worked so well in LoDo because all of the buildings were empty or otherwise easily removed to make way for the bars, restaurants, etc. If the stadium was built in an area that was still an active industrial area, there would be no space for businesses to move in to.  All in all, Coors Field has been great for LoDo, downtown, and the city as a whole. But a costly replacement of the stadium, extorted from the taxpayers under the threat of moving the team, would NOT be good for the city or neighborhood.  EDIT: spelling."

Denver,3d56n2,DeviatedNorm,4,Tue Jul 14 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"Why would the convention center cause restaurants, bars, apartments and condos to be built over a mile away in the ballpark area?  Even if things started lower down south, the area around the ballpark is developed because of the ballpark, not the convention center."
Denver,3d56n2,Ball_Slicker,-2,Tue Jul 14 04:33:01 2015 UTC,"Because downtown needed to expand and that was the last possible direction it could expand.  Eventually that area was going to gentrify, with or without the ballpark.  Even today, most of the area immediately adjacent to the ballpark is still empty, undeveloped parking lots.  If the ballpark is such a motivator (and not, say, Denver's economy generally doing a lot better than it was in 1995) why aren't those the prime development spots?  From April 2015, you can see just how yellow the areas around the ballfield are: https://twitter.com/UrbanDenver/status/592795601709957120/photo/1  The majority of yellow spots are all undeveloped, empty dirt parking lots.  The only other part of downtown that comes anywhere near close is property owned by Auraria or the Pepsi Center.  I do think the ballpark is a net positive influence on that area, but the reality is it isn't a building that revitalized that place.  Even the Convention Center's overall influence is weak.  It's a significantly expanded, more stable economy that's been bringing people here the past 20 years."

Denver,3d56n2,Ball_Slicker,9,Tue Jul 14 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"It was huge towards lodo development. My dad used to work down there and before the stadium it was not the kind of place you would stay in after dark. Now there are hundreds of businesses there, and they were able to keep a lot of the old charm during the revitalization.   It was also a relative steal compared to stadiums built this decade. One of the craziest facts I've seen about Coors Field is that it's the third oldest stadium in the national league (only wrigley and dodger stadium are older). It was built in a way that should age very well and only need periodic updates. For all that I would say we made out pretty good."
Denver,3d56n2,bzzltyr,9,Mon Jul 13 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I consider it a huge investment.  Without Coors Field, there was no reason for bars and restaurants to be downtown because nobody lived here and nobody was here on nights and weekends.  Denver went baseball crazy with that stadium, every game was sold out for years, which meant 50K+ people were coming into downtown when nobody else was.  Coors Field definitely had a big positive impact on Denver, without it the Pepsi Center might not have gone downtown or the Broncos Field might have moved to the suburbs..."
Denver,3d56n2,el_tophero,9,Mon Jul 13 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a particularly major player in the revitalization of LoDo/Five-Points but I wanted to know what the details were of the costs and this is what I found:  Coors Field cost $215 million to fund.  Between 22-25% was funded by the Rockies, the rest was (is?) funded by a 0.01% tax increase over 3-8 counties.  Sorry for the ranges, I got varied info.  The Denver Metropolitan Major League Baseball District (a corporate leg of the State of Colorado) legally owns the stadium and is financing it back to the Rockies.    And Coors has naming rights until 2018.  It appears the stadium is operated at a loss in general by the state, losing $1.5-2/mil year.  This amount does not include income generated by sales taxes.  And they were able to make a nice 22mil sale with RTD in 2013 over something?  But RTD is pretty much taxes too, so we also paid for that."
Denver,3d56n2,DeviatedNorm,6,Mon Jul 13 17:28:19 2015 UTC,"1) Jon Oliver was looking at the cost to replace a stadium, where one already existed.  Saying (rightly) that a new stadium wont generate enough new revenues to justify building the new one.  2) LoDo wasnt anything like it is today, before Coors was built.  What has been built since is responsible for billions of dollars of revenues over the decades since.  Revenues that weren't here before Coors was built.  Apartment buildings, condos, bars and restaurants.  Parking (and parking tickets! lol).  All kinds of new revenues and increased property values (property taxes!)  3) If Coors was replaced today, it surely would be a losing bet.  It wouldn't generate new revenues, not on the scale of the cost of the new stadium."
Denver,3d56n2,erickssm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:10:01 2015 UTC,Really would be dumb to ever rebuild it. With the city's housing boom I doubt it much contributed even with it bringing a new team to CO. Seems from these #'s it's a nice loss paid by tax payers.
Denver,3d56n2,Bob1e,3,Tue Jul 14 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the research!  I didn't realize it was operated at the state level rather than the local level.  That seems...  well if I lived in Grand Junction, I might be a little more than upset.  To probe your thoughts more, why do you think it wasn't a major player in the revitalization?  The answer to that question can only be hypothetical, but I'm curious about why you think that.  For the record, I can see arguments either way as equally valid, so I'm really just looking for what amounts to opinion.  There is no wrong answer (in my mind)."
Denver,3d56n2,DeviatedNorm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the tax seems to be only levied on a couple counties, and it appears it was voluntary for all the counties.  Not by vote, but their commissioners chose to support this venture.  I think LoDo was already pretty well starting its revitalization when the stadium was built and yet it still has taken the neighborhood immediately on the North and NWest sides of the stadium 20 years -- an entire generation -- to experience the revitalization/gentrification we've seen elsewhere in downtown.  If I have to point to a single building, I'm pointing to the Convention Center.  And I might even point to the Arts Pavillion before Coors."
Denver,3d56n2,DeviatedNorm,2,Mon Jul 13 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pointing to the Convention Center.    I can definitely see that being better for the city than a baseball stadium.

The stadium is in a shit location and the fans don't show up, even when they have been so competitive for the past 7 seasons.  I don't think Denver is the problem with the Rockies, its their own management. Moving the team to Montreal (who had a team and failed), Portland, Vegas, etc. isn't going to provide the franchise with a better opportunity.  As for asking for a different stadium within Denver, I can't think of anything that they could get that is better than Coors Field. It's in a good location and aesthetically it's holding up very well."

Denver,3d5o7l,GarthVolbeck,9,Mon Jul 13 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"I live in Cap Hill and commute daily on I-25 to Lone Tree, so even further South.  I actually don't see the drive as being that harsh -- I switch up the times that I go in, so sometimes it's 7am, sometimes it's 8:30am.  Traffic is obviously lighter the earlier you go in and leave, but even when I head out during prime rush hour, my commute typically tops out at 45 minutes.  I routinely check the 'drive time' in my car out of curiosity.  If I leave before 4pm, I can easily make it back to Cap Hill in 25-30ish minutes.  With that said, 2 inches of snowfall and we'd all get to work quicker by walking alongside 25."
Denver,3d5o7l,Thenyoufeelsorry,7,Mon Jul 13 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who does this commute it is not that bad. Obviously it is worse than what you are use to. It takes me 35 minutes each way via car. In my opinion if it is a good job, take it. Also the people who say the light rail is for people going in to the city have never been on it. The morning is packed and I have taken it a handful of times and a ton of people get off on Bellview which is the start of DTC. DTC is nice to work in as you can do all your errands after work as you are right next to Park Meadows mall. If you can try and do a 9-6 shift as the commute then takes 25 minutes each way."
Denver,3d5o7l,lsandler8,5,Mon Jul 13 19:48:55 2015 UTC,Yep pretty much unless you take light rail.

Denver,3d5o7l,napalminator,3,Mon Jul 13 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call those stops on the middle of the Tech Center.

Denver,3d5o7l,Lefaid,3,Mon Jul 13 19:22:27 2015 UTC,Is there such thing is the middle of the Tech Center? I work literally a block off the bellview station in the DTC. I would say based on the packed trains in the morning and afternoon your assessment  on this being for people going in to the city rather out is 100 percent wrong.
Denver,3d5o7l,lsandler8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:52:27 2015 UTC,I always visualize it as East of 25 at the least.  You probably have a better understanding of it than I do though.

Denver,3d5o7l,Supermonsters,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:36 2015 UTC,I work in the DTC and just moved from South Broadway to Sunnyside.  My commute went from 9 miles and 15-20 minutes to 15 miles and 40-55 minutes.  Its only been 3 months but I'm strongly considering looking downtown for a new job so I can walk/bike. 25N usually isn't too bad until you get to the Downing exit and its a parking lot every afternoon from Broadway to 70.

Denver,3d5o7l,nickhalfasleep,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:50 2015 UTC,"I've been doing Cap Hill to County Line for two years. The first year I drove. Mornings were usually good if I left before 7. The trip back was the killer. In the summer I would sometimes leave around 3 and traffic was already backing up. The commute back was usually 30 minutes to an hour. Sitting in traffic behind the wheel makes me want to shove a screwdriver in my ear.   Once I discovered that I could get a serious discount through work, I started getting montly RTD passes. My travel time is about the same as what I was averaging in my car. My apartment is right off the 0 line, which makes it easier. You may have to add an extra bus trip since you're in the Cheese. Other ways to get to the trains are bike or car2go. There are shuttles that pick up at the train stations that will get you right to or pretty close to your office in DTC."

Denver,3d5o7l,Cheapo911,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:54:55 2015 UTC,It depends on a few things.     What do you mean by DTC?    DTC proper I25/Bellview to Arapahoe isn't that bad.  Sometimes people refer to like Park Meadows (Dry Creek and further south) as DTC.   That sucks.  Doing bike/RTD light rail isn't a bad option.   I've done it from Congress park.    It is like two or three quick and beautiful miles to the University station through Wash Park and another 20 minutes via LR to the DTC.    Added bonus:  It is also pretty much downhill all the way to the LR station.  On inclement weather days you can either drive or take the bus to the LR station.   If you live close to York it is pretty convenient.
Denver,3d5o7l,remarquian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:42 2015 UTC,The thing about commuting from Cap Hill to DTC is that the time is almost unpredictable. Some days I25 might be running smoothly and it will take you 25min and others it's a complete mess for no reason and will take you close to an hour. If you have the option of flex scheduling do it as 8-5 is the most heavily used time. But otherwise its really not as bad as people make it out to be.
Denver,3d5o7l,Daughedm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for the suggestions/comments. I am at once disheartened and hopeful, haha."
Denver,3d5o7l,ZshadeZ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:41:52 2015 UTC,I drive from Englewood to Northglenn daily... your commute really isn't very far. You could easily avoid I25 altogether and have no real issues.
Denver,3d5o7l,MilkyPuff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:03:41 2015 UTC,"The light rail takes forever, unfortunately, because you have to get to a stop by Auroria or in LoDo. I commute to 25 and Belleview and it takes me 30 minutes. Not really all that bad."
Denver,3d5o7l,kmoonster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"If you have a car, you might try taking Speer/Leetsdale to Quebec or Monaco and drop south and take the little 'beltway' that goes around Greenwood Village. The Tech Center is relatively easy to get to this way. The freeway also works, just not sure where you are in Cap Hill/Cheesman area--from some parts of the neighborhood it is worse to try getting on 25 than to just fight traffic in Cherry Creek. I think University gets you onto Hamden and Bellview as well, but I don't go that way often enough to remember.  The whole tech center/Greenwood Village area /looks/ nice--it's very pleasant on the eyes. But it's a b*tch to navigate on bike or car. You may not believe me, but just try it before you make a commitment if you want to drive. It is split by 25 and 225. East/West roads (Arapahoe, Bellview, Hampden, etc) are great. North/South roads (Quebec, Syracuse, Monaco, Yosemite) are terrible as they are constantly switching which track they are on, most don't cross or access the freeway (and some don't even cross the main E/W roads, despite being major N/S routes in the rest of town). There are loops, and loops within loops, and it doesn't make sense the way the loops are connected--sometimes you have to take side streets to get from major street to major street, and the major streets don't necessarily follow their entire track (they start and stop with no rhyme or reason).  There are a lot of really nice looking flyovers that don't connect to other main routes or the freeway, despite both being major thoroughfares.  Others may disagree with me, but I feel strongly about this!"

Denver,3d0sa4,yeradolt,0,Mon Jul 13 15:34:55 2015 UTC,Man.. the frustration that causes you to make such a genuinely pathetic attempt at trolling must be crushing.   You are a child stuck in an adult's body. No amount of peepee poopoo half assed troll comments are going to make me upset or make you less sad. Ugh it's uncomfortable to even think about it. I would say /r/cringe if /r/cringe wasn't more like /r/im14andthisiscringe.   Cheers m8. Good luck climbing out of that funk.

Denver,3d23xx,Autodidact2,3,Sun Jul 12 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"This week's hike features wildflowers, lush, green meadows and lots of stream crossings. Hiked this morning with /u/Audodidact2's daughter and we can report that the streams are still high and the profusion of wildflowers that makes this trail so gorgeous is just beginning, due to high levels of late season snow and rain this year. So a hike in a week or two would be perfect.  This hike is only an hour out of town, not terribly crowded and, if you get all the way to the top, above treeline, almost to the continental divide, there's some weird old rusty mining equipment up there.  blog post  One odd feature of this hike is that you drive past the huge and hideous Henderson Mine to get there. Don't worry, just take the dirt road to the right and it disappears behind you quickly. Also take your walking stick and a spare pair of socks. Enjoy.  Questions always welcome."
Denver,3d23xx,BakerNeighborhoodlum,3,Sun Jul 12 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"Hey! I bet we passed each other on the hike. Three of us guys, started the trail head at 10:15, back at about 2:15p. It really is a nice hike -- babbling brooks, a decent little waterfall feature, canopied forest trail, and them boom you are above all the trees.    You're right about the few stream crossings -- janky logs provided if your balance is good...otherwise, cool off your feet and and just walk barefoot. As you're heading up, somewhere after the first or second log crossing, you get to a point where it looks like the stream has totally taken over the trail (the trail is basically an old unused jeep road). There's a sanctioned high path to your right you can take to keep dry that follows alongside the washed out part.  I don't have a dog, but there were quite a few dogs and the ones I saw were really digging being able to play a little bit in water. So bring them along! And you know what? Not one discarded poop bag tied to a branch or left to be picked up on the way down. We did it, Reddit!"

Then make your decision.  If they all didn't have to disperse at the same time, I think things would be slightly more reasonable.  The number of times I've been at a bar around here and heard a group say ""it's almost 2AM!  let's get a couple more rounds of shots!"" is ridiculous."

Suddenly instead of headliners starting at 11pm or 12 am, suddenly they're not starting til 2 am. As someone who works a 9-5 schedule this always killed me, as by 2 am I'm more than ready to collapse into bed"
Denver,3d2ank,radektheczar,6,Mon Jul 13 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"Back home bars were open until 4AM. I think the over-serving problem is exaggerated because bar staff know when to cut people off, regardless of closing time.  Overall it's more fun and more business, I don't see a problem with it."

Denver,3d2ank,dustlesswalnut,3,Mon Jul 13 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"Stop serving at 2 but stay open until 4, gives time to sober up"

Denver,3d2ank,j00baGGinz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"At 2am, there aren't many people that will want to wait around for a the waitress to bring them food when they can walk to Slice Works, Taco Bell, Mcdonalds, etc. and get something ""fast"". Plus people generally stop ordering food around 10PM anyway. That's why most bars close their kitchens around then.They can send the cooks/chefs home at 10pm and not have to pay for them to sit around while and wait until they stop serving alcohol.  Also, the profit margin on food is generally small compared to alcohol."
Denver,3d2ank,dustlesswalnut,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:50 2015 UTC,Sales have to stop at 2am. Serving doesn't.

Denver,3d2ank,sativan,6,Mon Jul 13 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"""Stocked up"" as in ""have to have some beer or liquor at home""? Who doesn't have enough alcohol at home to get drunk on in a given night?  If people want to drink until 4am and have greater access to liquor, that's their choice. I lived in Chicago for 3 years, and they have 4am bars, and I never once was at a bar until 4am.

Denver,3d6jsx,sonowruhappy1,5,Tue Jul 14 17:21:40 2015 UTC,This always happens when there are this many witnesses. They start sharing stories and all of a sudden they remember it diffrently. Its how memory works plain and simple.

Denver,3d6jsx,kirbycope,2,Mon Jul 13 23:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and when you you talk about it with others it will change the memory. So if they were talking with some one and they said I saw the gunman here at this time and you say well I saw him here at that time. You will both have changes your memories. Another example would be if some one asked if you saw all the shooters or even how many shooters did you see, this can change your memory as its a suggestive question. Police are trained not to do this but the average layman is not, its also why cops seperate everyone as soon as possible when there are multiple witnesess. In the shit storm that was the after math of the shooting they weren't able to do this as well as they should have and just like with other cases like this people talked to eachother and memories got scewed."

The dash cam isn't always on and the police officers that took him into custody parked on the other side of the theater before going to the back area to look for victims and try and secure the exit. It was about half an hour before a car came and picked him up. No reason to have a dash cam on in any car that responded. Dashcams are used for traffic stops not mass shooting response. There is plenty of video showing him going in with the balistic chaps/leggings on, buying several tickets trying to get theater 9 but not getting it so he just went into it anyways. He pretended to take a phone call to not draw attention(his words and what others saw) to him going out back when the previews started. He used a make shift table cloth clamp to keep the door from locking, got in his car put up a sunscreen in the front window and got dressed in the rest of his suit. he walked in about 15 min into the movie(when cat woman is stealing his grandmas necklace) and opens fire with the shotgun.

Denver,3d6urf,adamzissou,4,Tue Jul 14 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a native and it seems like over the past few years, more and more of my friends are starting to complain about the amount of people who are from out of town who not only clog up roads in and around the city (and even more so outside of LODO) but also are extremely disrespectful to our city and its culture.    That's been happening for decades now.  It's nothing new.  My parents and grandparents bitched about Californians and Texans way back in the early 80's.  People younger than me bitch about them.  They're just a scapegoat.  Tell me, if they didn't have Texas or California plates on your car, would you be able to differentiate between them and shitty Colorado drivers?  Fuck this whole ""Denver Culture"" bullshit.  Denver culture was much different 15 years ago, and it'll be much different 15 years from now.  Culture progresses.  Either deal with that change, or leave.   I don't want to type cast all tourists, but the ones who seem to be the most dangerous on the road or the most disrespectful have been from California, Illinois, or Texas.    You just did exactly what you said you didnt want to do.  You typecast everyone.   I regret to inform any people from Cali but I-25 is not the 405 and you don't need to drive like a fucking dingus to get where you're going.   I regret to inform you that I-25 ain't I-70, and I-225 ain't I-90.  The 405 ain't I-270.  I-25 @ 120th is different than I-25 @ 6th Ave, and that's different from I-25 in DTC.   Shit changes from area to area, not just state to state.  Tourists suck EVERYWHERE.  Period.   I've been flipped off by drivers multiple times who've I've signaled to put their phone down while driving as well.    Ok, then quit doing that.  Now.  You'll stop getting flipped off, and it doesn't do anything positive anyway, it just adds to the collective drive time angst.   Are people really that oblivious and spiteful that they would react in such a way to someone looking out for them?   Yes.  All over the United States.  And you're not looking out for them, so stop using that as an excuse.  What you're really doing is not looking out for yourself and the people around you.  That's dangerous.   Not only is it dangerous,  but it puts me at risk, and I don't appreciate that.  Why are you so angry at them, anyway?  They're just bad drivers.  Every state has them.  Colorado is no different than any other area.  The assholes in GWV drive differently than the assholes in The Bellows, and differently than the assholes downtown.  Spend a week driving from 58th to Colfax, and then spend a week driving in Highlands Ranch.  It's completely different.  If you're a native and over the age of 18, then you should know this by now.  Stop ""signaling"" at bad drivers.  The fact that you're interacting with them is why you get the finger, and it gives asshole drivers more ammo to use against you.  Keep your eyes on the road, continue to stay off your phone, and just keep calm while driving.  Let the assholes do their thing.  They'll stay on their phone no matter what you try to do, and taking your eyes off the road in order to shake your phone and yell at them makes you just as dangerous as those texting pricks.    FFS, you're operating a 2,000 lb vehicle moving at high speeds, and if you're paying attention to the person driving next to you, you're not paying attention to the road in front of you.  Stay chill.  Drive like a sane person.   I hope this doesn't sound like a DAE thread    Well, it does.   but there have been plenty of people in this sub who've expressed annoyance with the increase in tourists in our city and neighboring counties.   Denver is a tourist destination.  Look at the states around us.  Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Utah, New Mexico.  Where the fuck else are people going to go?  Ogallala??  Adapt, or move to Santa Fe, and deal with the shitty drivers there.  PS:  At least Texans know how the fast lane/slow lane system works, and if you flash your headlights at them, they'll move out of the way so you can zoom past."

Denver,3d3872,adiederich,8,Mon Jul 13 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"Oof...that debt could be a problem.    What do you mean she owes money to other Realtors?  And is that PLURAL?  SHe owes money to more than one? Is this unpaid rent? Abandoned utilities? Can she demonstrate that she has been paying off the debt?  Does she have other derogatory things on her credit report or is this her only problem?  Was she evicted? Did she go to court?  Do you have an idea of how it appears? Is it on a credit report as a collection? Or does it show as a judgement? Was it in Colorado or another state?  So lots of questions there.  What I am trying to get is an impression of how this is going to appear on her report. If it is a collection and she has not been making payments then that is a problem.  BUT, like you say, they may accept a higher deposit. If she has been working to pay it off then I would say you could be pretty hopeful. If it's a judgement then you're probably screwed.  I could go on to speculate more but we'd end up with a wall of text so if you have questions, PM me.  Is it a deal breaker?  If it was me, yes. No way I would rent to her. Laramar is big though, they can absorb more risk than I would ever consider. It's good you disclosed up front and it is good the guy seemed to think it was still possible. They see shit like this all. day. long. So long as the debt is not astronomical you've got a good chance. But, man, if it's a judgement...  If you love the place and you see yourself there for a good amount of time then I would say it is worth it to try and apply and be hopeful they work with you on the deposit. If you get declined, ask them if you can have a copy of the documentation (50/50 chance they will give it to you). If $100 is a lot of money to you right now though, I dunno. You might want to look elsewhere.  Also, get yourself some credit!! And tell that girl to shape up!  This kind of shit sticks to you for too long.  Best to make it go away if she can."

I think they were just trying to get rid of me but since I had the cash they let me move in.  My credit score is tanked due to a mortgage foreclosure and a shit ton of medical bills.

Best way to test your graphics cards functionality is to swap it out with a different one to see if that one will power up. If not, either the power supply is not giving enough power to the graphics card via the 6 pin power connector if your card has one or the motherboard could be going out.  Your computer really sounds like every dying HP I've come across in the past few years minus the turning itself back on part.   Another thing to try if possible is to check and see if the motherboard has onboard graphics. If it does, unplug the power, take the CMOS battery out and take out the graphics card. The put the battery back in after a couple minutes or so and plug in the monitor to the onboard graphics. Plug the computer in and see if anything displays on the screen.

Denver,3d0qh3,seant117,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty nice setup you have there. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like your motherboard has onboard graphics since it is a higher end board. The best way to diagnose the issue is to take out one card since you have them in SLI, powering it on, seeing if it does turn on and if not, try the other card. So one card in at a time. If that doesn't work, I really want to say it's your motherboard but it couldn't hurt to test the power supply. Give ASrock a call and see if they can replace the motherboard under warranty if you come to the conclusion that it is for sure the motherboard. It could even be something as simple as the BIOS needing an update but I would recommend against that at the moment since your system is unstable and could turn off at any time.  Did you build the computer yourself? Mind if you share some pictures so I can kinda see how everything is organized?"
Denver,3d0qh3,seant117,2,Sun Jul 12 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Of course! Here are some pics of the build. I wanted something nice once I was out and living on my own, and it seemed like a fun hobby. I mostly use it for gaming, but I'm looking to get into coding, too. Hell, I'm learning a lot just trying to fix it, so I think it was one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I think I'm gonna take my cards down to clutch gaming and see if they can help. Seems like my best option at the moment, and they're just down the street."
Denver,3d0qh3,amikez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"I tried just one card and I came across something interesting... The graphics card works, but not when the monitor is plugged in! .... What the hell does that mean?"
Denver,3d0qh3,napalminator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest and say I don't know. Is only one card in the machine? Did you take the other completely out? And when you swap that card for the other card, does it do exactly the same thing? Have you tried that one single card in different PCI-e slots?"
Denver,3d0qh3,napalminator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"Shit, I thought I had isolated the problem to a specific cord, but now it's doing it no matter what's plugged in. The graphics card's fan goes on, but dies in a couple seconds. I've tried one card at a time, with each monitor. Same results. So it's gotta be the motherboard, right?"
Denver,3d0qh3,SackBoyZombie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Right now, it sounds like it could be the motherboard. Obviously I'm not there to tell you for sure if it is or isn't and I don't want you to go by an educated guess over the internet. But with the information we've gathered, I want to believe it's safe to say that it is the motherboard. Give ASrock a call and see if they can warranty out the board for you. I've never dealt with ASrock customer service before so I'm not sure what they are like. I mainly deal with Asus and Gigabyte boards which have been nothing but excellent to me and my clients."
Denver,3d0qh3,napalminator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, man, thanks for all your help. I'll check that out or see if I can take it to a more professional shop at this point. Thank you!"
Denver,3d0qh3,SackBoyZombie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:10:56 2015 UTC,ASRock support is ok. I had to RMA a board when I built my last machine. Twice. They at least covered shipping and got the new boards to me within a couple days; just frustrating to have to wait a couple extra weeks to actually have it up and running.
Denver,3d0qh3,NickCiufi,2,Mon Jul 13 04:31:37 2015 UTC,No fan spinning on a video card is a very bad sign. I fix PCs and I do occasionally have to replace old graphics cards.  Go to microcenter and buy a new one. They're pretty liberal with returns as long as you keep the packaging nice. Pick up a new power supply while you're there too - those go out more than any other PC component and a new one never hurts.
Denver,3d0qh3,HSChronic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:37:07 2015 UTC,You make it sound so simple.... I have two $350 video cards and neither one seems to be working. Are there any other options I can explore before just replacing them? What would have caused them both to fail at the same time?
Denver,3d0qh3,HSChronic,2,Sun Jul 12 15:40:41 2015 UTC,Both flaking at the same time is weird. Do they require power from the PSU?  If that's bad it can fry anything.

Denver,3d0qh3,Tectract,2,Sun Jul 12 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I'd first try the on board graphics on the motherboard just to make sure those are working. If you get something displayed on your screen it's most likely your graphics card.  Either way I think a good way to know without having to replace your graphics card would be to try them on another computer if you know someone, you'll know then if it's your gpu or something else."
Denver,3d0qh3,Tectract,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"Trying the cards in another machine would be the best way to diagnose them, assuming you can find another machine to play with.    Would really help to know the specs of the cards."

Denver,3cz7ek,Prof_Acorn,3,Sun Jul 12 04:27:28 2015 UTC,On the website there's someone in one of the photos with a Secular Humanist symbol. Maybe it's an atheist church? But why be so secretive about it? Just call it the Sunday Humanist Assembly if that's what it is.
Denver,3cz7ek,Groovyaardvark,3,Sun Jul 12 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"Its basically church without religion. Its the community parts of a congregation with the faith aspect removed. The main focus is instead shifted to just having a good time, hanging out with like minded people and listening to science/nature/philosophical topics.  If I see a speaker who is particularly interesting to me I will attend. It is certainly a bit of an experiment, and each assembly's vibe is entirely dependent upon that group. The first Sunday Assembly in London for instance was mostly led by a stand up comedian for instance. I'm not really big into the ""holding hands and sing song"" aspect of it. This is my understanding anyway."
Denver,3cz7ek,enjo13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:01:49 2015 UTC,Any idea what separates it from Unitarian Universalism?
Denver,3cz7ek,Groovyaardvark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. I am certainly not an expert, but they do appear similar in many regards from what I have read.   The biggest difference that stands out to me is that one is essentially not religious in any sense. It really does seem to be a gathering of mostly secular humanists looking for a sense of community, without a combined or real ""spiritual"" purpose.    The other appears to focus on some sort of personnel ""spiritual"" fulfillment through a variety of beliefs and influences although extending even to atheism/agnosticism. I think it would be fair to call Unitarian Universalism a religion, unlike Sunday Assemblies.   I think secular humanists by in large are likely to be more critical of many aspects of organized religion/sacred texts etc. Where as Unitarian Universalism holds these practices/texts/teachings as potentially meaningful parts of an individual's spiritual journey with meetings facilitated by someone titled Reverend."

Denver,3cwzcx,shoes17,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"Quick way to test the power supply if you are comfortable with your ability not to electrocute yourself. Open the case, unplug the P1 on the motherboard (big long 24 pin power connector). Locate a paper clip. Unfold the paper clip into a U shape. To test the PSU, locate the green wire and jump it with and black wire. If you see the fans on your power supply turn on, it could mean it's good. But what if the power supply was under load? There's a better way to test that. And it's to plug in a spare power supply and see if it boots. If it does, all you need is a spare power supply.   If it gave you the reboot or insert proper boot device message, it could mean one of two things: the hard drive is not getting enough power to spin up and to be detected by the BIOS for the computer to boot from or it is possible that you have bumped the 7 pin SATA cable loose on accident and the computer didn't pick it up.   I'd be willing to take a look anytime this week and would be (hopefully) able to repair the computer for you as well. PM me if you are interested and we can set up a time and date and I'll bring my tools and an extra power supply to test with.

Does nobody realize that landlords wouldn't demand these prices if they weren't able to? Did supply and demand suddenly fall off the train?  I bought a house three years ago, and I looked everywhere from baker to RiNo to the burbs. I found I could get an 800 square foot 1b1b duplex for $170k in Denver or a 1400 square foot 3b2.5b place in the suburbs for $140k.  I work in Denver county and find the commute and the cost of a car vs cycling to work along with the resale value to be a much better deal. Sure, I have a fifteen minute uber to downtown whenever I want to go out, but that still doesn't outweigh the fact that my mortgage is less than most rents and I'm building equity.

My 1br/1bath was going for $1090 a month $1120 if I resigned my lease before I moved out. 620sqft no fucking storage or guaranteed parking. Granted that was on Green Mountain, but trying to live out here in the west  I wasn't finding anything sub $850 for the same setup with sub 600sqft space."

I guess they're against unpopular opinion. /r/denver is notorious for being one-sided in opinions and downvoting. It wasn't always like this.  As a landlord, my rent prices have gone up as well and I'm not in Denver county. Again, this is due to supply in demand. I can charge more because people are willing to pay more. When no one wants to rent it at the price it's available for, then prices drop. It's simple math. Obviously, there's more math involved in determining market value based on the area, but it's basically simple supply/demand."

There are similar down payment assistance programs for many of the cities in Colorado. Call one of those programs and ask the person to walk you through how it works. If their program cannot help you ask them to refer you to other similar programs.   Some programs are grants and some are loans.
Denver,3ctjq7,roboeyes,0,Sat Jul 11 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of programs like FHA that will lower the needed down payment, you can get the down payment in a loan as well, or you can borrow against your 401k if you have one.

That being said, the city has done a poor job planning (lack of affordable housing, miserable highway system, etc) and jobs are not paying to accommodate the high COL since so many people are still moving here despite these conditions.   It's sad because my first year here I was in LOVE. I lived for 600 a month downtown and thought it couldn't get better. Now my apt complex raised rent 40% (different complex from the 600 one) and I'm moving in with family. I'm happy I got a chance to experience old Denver a little but it is dead now and that's something we have to live with. It's never going to go back to what it once was because people finally discovered how great this place is.

My family had lived here a long time and been coming here since probably before you were born. Not trying to say this makes me an expert. Just that I have an idea of the ""old"" Denver in terms of COL. I don't understand why you're trying to prove a point with this specific statement in my comment. It's super childish.

Denver,3ctjq7,Mernerak,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"Denver isn't really that expensive compared to most tech hubs and the big cities on the coasts. It's certainly not San Francisco. I live in Northern Virginia right now; Denver is one of the cities I'm looking at moving to.  Just browsing Craigslist and Zillow I can find studios for under a grand, 2BR's for about $1300. The only way you can get prices like that here is if you are very far out from the District, and in that case, you will be commuting about 3-4 hours a day. That's not an exaggeration; I did that for a long time. If you want a reasonable commute (say, half an hour,) you will pay about $1600 for a studio here.  Just a little perspective on the situation. The reality is your rent prices aren't very high for an area with a good jobs market and so forth, despite the fact they have been increasing.  So, there is the difference in salaries, and that's a complex thing to analyze, but for tech workers, the salaries are roughly the same here and there. That's one reason I'm considering your city; if I stay here, ~ half of my income goes to rent. That's... simply not very pleasing."
Denver,3ctjq7,MiniTab,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Denver isn't really that expensive compared to most tech hubs and the big cities on the coasts.   It's catching up fast. It is now quite a bit more than Portland, for instance. Denver city proper is projected to grow by 100,000 in the next 10 years, I suspect it will soon be in the Seattle and San Diego range.  A new building just went up by my house and 750 square foot 1 bedrooms are listed at $2,600, and this is not LODO but a central but peripheral area more like Uptown or the Highlands."

Denver,3ctjq7,sevargmas,19,Fri Jul 10 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had a neighbor who was retired and I'm assuming living on ss because after 4 years in his Aurora one-bedroom, they kept raising the rent so he had to move out last month.  He really loved Denver but fuck him!  Am I right??!"
Denver,3ctjq7,MsLotusLane,-5,Fri Jul 10 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Is that really you response to supply and demand?  If he decided to retire early and live off of SS, its his fault he cant afford it. I love urban Denver too but I cant afford it and thus I dont live there. I choose to live somewhere where demand is lower and thus housing costs are too."
Denver,3ctjq7,sevargmas,6,Fri Jul 10 18:44:17 2015 UTC,Who said he retired early?  Is it so wrong to try to make affordable housing available instead of demanding poor people just relocate some abstract place where the rent is not likely to go up?
Denver,3ctjq7,mojobytes,0,Fri Jul 10 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"If he cant afford to buy a home, needs to rent an apartment, and is being priced out of his preferred neighborhood by demand pricing, then yes, he retired too early. If he were still gainfully employed he likely wouldn't have been priced out by a rate increase.   And rent control has proven to be a terrible idea time and again. It is literally a textbook example in any entry level economics classroom to demonstrate how interference with natural supply and demand can have the opposite effect and make items (in this case housing) more expensive."
Denver,3ctjq7,bogusnot,2,Fri Jul 10 20:42:50 2015 UTC,So basically some people can never retire.  Got it.
Denver,3ctjq7,bogusnot,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"Is that honestly what your takeaway is from what I said? Are you really that shortsighted?  Look, if you want to retire in an expensive urban setting, you either start saving early or work a few more years until you know you can afford it. What you don't do is simply stop working and reduce your income, live off of SS, and expect the local taxpayers and/or property owners to lower rental rates below where demand sets them and subsidize your way of life. Get real.   I'll say it one more time: rent control increases overall housing costs. So which way do you want it? You cant have your cake and eat it too.   Edit: Yep. Thats what I thought. Nothing but downvotes. Uneducated losers who think the govt should pave (and pay) the way for you. I'd say I hope aren't voters but if you're too lazy to work I'm certain you're too lazy to vote.

Make sure to really feel good about the therapist you choose, they should have a meet and greet with you before formal sessions start. Don't be afraid to ask all the questions you can think of and do be afraid to shop around if you don't click the way you want/need. In general just make sure you are comfortable with them. I also found someone that was really easy for me to get to, and that helped a bunch. I would recommend someone for you but they moved away in January :/  Again, good on you, and good luck!

The victim was cramped in a car, any attempt to reach for the weapon would have been easily noticeable and would have gotten her shot. Nothing she had there was worth her's and/or her children's lives (definitely not the $85 he took), safest thing to do is what she did and just give what they are asking for.

But if you feel a turn for the worst you've got to go for it and act quick.   Ideally if she had to act and was prepared, I would say with that weak grip hes got my left hand would be grabbing that and pulling it in, while I drove my right down for my firearm at my appendix. That being said, much easier to say what you should do after the incident compared at the time of the threat. Either way glad she made it out ok."

But if she was to force open door open and accelerate the gun isn't really pointed ""at"" her for a lot of the video plus he's back behind which would force the gun to be pointed in front of her and not at her. Given that he's holding the gun sideways leads me to think he's probably not the best marksman and shooting at a moving target is much harder then most people realize. Even if I was carrying I probably wouldn't draw in a situation like this since he has a positional advantage on her. You would have to turn and fire but he's already in firing position."

Denver,3ctxom,enjo13,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"The scalpers seem to get their hands on corporate tickets pretty often. A bunch of big companies in Denver have blocks of seats they hand out to employees, many of those tickets (free to the employee) make their way into scalpers hands.  Add on to that season ticket holders dumping seats, individuals dumping extra tickets because friends didn't show up, etc... and you have a market that works for scalpers."

Denver,3cpz1x,BlackbeltJones,4,Fri Jul 10 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"There is no initiative.  Colorado State's ""Competition in Utility Act"" limits competition to the private sector and forbids the creation of municipal networks.  Before any local government in the state is allowed to create one, they must put it to a vote in a general election, ex, ""Should Denver County establish municipal broadband, YES or NO?""  Any registered voter can start the initiative process.  See Article 8 Section 3 of the Denver Charter (page 99 of this PDF).  TLDR: Get 5 registered voters, file with the county clerk, collect 50ish,000 verifiable signatures, and petition City Council to put it on the ballot.  Only after a YEA vote by the general public can Denver even begin to fund and implement municipal broadband, barring any potential legal injunctions, contractual issues, or other challenges that may be posed by the telecom interests."
Denver,3cpz1x,COScout,3,Fri Jul 10 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"Here's the actual law for anyone curious.   My question is, can we vote just to authorize it, or do we have to include funding for it as well?"
Denver,3cpz1x,BlackbeltJones,2,Fri Jul 10 14:27:15 2015 UTC,The first step is just giving the city the go-ahead with municipal broadband to meet the terms of the Competition in Utility Act.  The logistics of its implementation can come afterward.
Denver,3cpz1x,BlackbeltJones,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:34:07 2015 UTC,"50 or 50,000 signatures?"

Denver,3cweej,uber2016,9,Sat Jul 11 12:15:46 2015 UTC,OK you might not have to pay after all - it's a bit complicated....  here is a lookup page to see if your plate is in district.  Also there are a whole bunch of park n rides that are free so maybe you could just take a few minutes and drive over to a free one??  Here is a map.  The ones in blue are free.  You can also set up an automated account with park in ride which gets you a 15% discount so fees go down to 3.60 which hey - is better than a kick in the head .  Lastly you may want to consider getting a UPS Store mailbox inside the district you wish to park at and registering your car at that address.  Those mailboxes cost about than 20 bucks a month which is a significant savings over the $80 you would be paying now.  So there are some possible solutions for you to try.
Denver,3cweej,KevinOllie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the lookup! I just live further south, so the easiest place for me to get on the rail is the Lincoln station. I'll have to take I-25 north, and there aren't too many free park stations near it that I could then walk to the rail station. I'll probably just have to deal with the extra $80 this month.  I don't ever remember seeing a map like this before to separate who pays for parking and who doesn't, but apparently it was instated as far back as 2009. It just made things a lot more confusing trying to figure out if I apply or not."

Denver,3cweej,Sne4kyWomb4t,5,Sat Jul 11 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"Calm down man. IMHO, parking should be free. Even taking busses, a round trip bus can cost $12 on us36 when you pay for parking. I can drive for less than that. And if you think $12 is cheap, it's not. It's way overpriced."
Denver,3cweej,DeviatedNorm,-6,Sat Jul 11 14:24:38 2015 UTC,$12 is cheap. Why should parking be free? You are using a space that could otherwise be used by another individual.
Denver,3cweej,Sne4kyWomb4t,2,Sat Jul 11 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"So unless you drive a leaded 1950s Chevy truck, $12 a day is not cheap. Your argument about using a space is irrelevant to the discussion of whether said space should be free. It's used in either case. Additionally, tax dollars. From rtd' sown website   Sales tax revenues account for 69% of those revenues while passenger fares account for 30%, with the remaining one percent coming from on-vehicle advertising and grants."
Denver,3cweej,DeviatedNorm,4,Sat Jul 11 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"Right, and parking is free -- for those who are presumed to have paid the majority of the sales taxes (residents of the ares where the taxes are collected).  That's why there's this out of district distinction."
Denver,3cweej,uber2016,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"You're assuming taxes collected within the district exclusively. I'm assuming the area that rtd operates in general. I doubt very much it's as restricted as you say simply because of the volume of cash necessary to operate. But let's look at it differently. Go out in a suburb and ask someone if they ride the bus. I bet you most don't. If you ask why, they'd say most likely it's expensive and inconvenient. As population density continues to grow in the front range, we have to embrace public transit more and do that by lowering the barrier to entry. Free parking may encourage ridership. We will spend millions on a highway and not bat an eye. We don't say wow that road is expensive, we build it out Bc there is a need. I wait for the day we look at public transit in the same way. This country may be built on the open road and on gas, but our longevity sits not on the road, in choked up traffic, but in sensible, fully funded mass transit that meets the needs of the many. Not just those lucky enough to live in a district."
Denver,3cweej,diskx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Not assuming anything, I know that to be the case.   Counties of Denver, Boulder, and Jefferson. Generally, Broomfield County (except certain areas immediately adjacent to I-25 and Highway 7 interchange), Adams County (west of Box Elder Creek), Arapahoe County (south of I-70, generally west of Picadilly Rd. to Jewell, then west of Gun Club Rd. to Quincy, then generally west of Monaghan Rd., including Arapahoe Park and Aurora Reservoir), and Douglas County (northern portion consisting of the original city of Lone Tree, the town of Parker, all annexed areas of Lone Tree and the Acres Green area, plus Highlands Ranch), and parts of Weld County that have been annexed by the city of Longmont and the town of Erie since 1994. The area within the boundaries of the town of Castle Rock does not have RTD sales/use tax.   I agree we should embrace mass transit more, but that seems like a different discussion.  I'm just saying OP needs to pay for things, one way or another.  And since the city OP lives in voted to forgo the taxes in 2005, daily parking rates it is."
Denver,3cweej,UnCounted36244,4,Sun Jul 12 00:17:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I've lived in this state for 12 years now. I live in Castle Rock, which is not covered for free parking. Parker, which is like 10 minutes away from me, even gets free parking. People as far out as Montrose or Grand Junction even get free parking. Like I said, never been charged. I did some research, and if I have to pay then I have to pay.  I thought I'd be paying only $45 to get the 10ride to downtown each week and back, but I have to pay nearly double that because of parking.

The primary reason for the 1900 Market as a no parking zone is for safety purposes, just like 1400 Market is at 12a. The underlying issue is that people generally refuse to follow the posted restrictions."
Denver,3cpvkv,DenverMeterMaid,6,Fri Jul 10 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"Could you please explain to me the safety purposes of turning Market into a no parking zone at 12AM?    It seems to me most of the cars parked down there are visiting the bars and it sounds awfully silly/dangerous to me to force all those people enjoying alcoholic beverages into their cars all at once to avoid parking fines.  What am I missing here?   What is the crucial danger involved in those cars being parked on the side of the road for an extra 2 hours until bars close?    Or better yet, why not allow them to stay parked overnight for those who may have overindulged and should not operate a motor vehicle can take public transportation, uber/lyft or a taxi?  Instead of turning in to ""no parking zones"" those metered spots should become free parking after midnight until 8 am the next morning since the only reason people are parking down there in the first place (past 10 PM) is to visit the bars, it seems like a greater risk to force people out of the bars and into their cars at midnight..."
Denver,3cpvkv,hankbaumbach,5,Fri Jul 10 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Market/LoDo is an absolute shit show after 10pm. What it comes down to is emergency access, fewer cars, better accessibility both on the block and thru as the case may be.    Or better yet, why not allow them to stay parked overnight for those who may have overindulged and should not operate a motor vehicle can take public transportation, uber/lyft or a taxi?   YAY!!!  Come to LoDo and enjoy your experience. Those that make policy have decided that if you wish to do so, you must park off street. There are lots of reasons for it, street sweeping, certain maintenance activities, safety etc.  It wasn't until 2011 that you were allowed to even be on the street after 2am. And if you are planning on drinking, then be an adult and plan for that as well by ensuring your car is parked legally; and yes, that may mean paying for an off street space.    Instead of turning in to ""no parking zones"" those metered spots should become free parking after midnight until 8 am the next morning since the only reason people are parking down there in the first place (past 10 PM) is to visit the bars,   Not true. There is a ton of stuff that goes on at night. Granted the businesses are limited but they still have some activity.  There's a sleep study place on 1700 Blake, lots of cars there. Your experience is not an accurate representation of the downtown, and quite literally, when you look at bars only, it's really just Market, Blake and a bit of Larimer.    it seems like a greater risk to force people out of the bars and into their cars at midnight...   I agree. There was a push to allow bars to stay open later, thus patrons could trickle out thru the night as opposed to the Brofest shitshow that 2am is. It failed. http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/boosters_bits/2014/02/a-look-at-how-a-bill-that-could-have.html"
Denver,3cpvkv,DenverMeterMaid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"Market/Lodo is an absolute shit show after 10 PM   No arguments here. :)  However, I wonder if clearing the streets of all parked cars at 10PM is making things better or worse in that department.  And if there is such a virulent need for emergency services such as ambulances and police cars to the point that a law was passed to clear out the streets in order to make access easier for said personnel, maybe the city should just station an ambulance and paddywagon on the corner of Market and 19th from 9 PM on.  Hell, they can even have their own designated spaces!   There's a sleep study place on 1700  Blake, lots of cars there.   How does that make your point about street parking expiring more valid?  If anything those people should be granted free parking as well, if they are volunteering or performing sleep studies they have to be there all night anyway!  I do understand your point that there are more than bars downtown, but that's precisely my point as well, in order to enjoy those activities which take place downtown past 10 PM, parking becoming invalid parking is ludicrous.  For any business that operates prior to 10 PM, I have no problem paying for parking meters.  In fact, I'd be perfectly fine with continuing to pay parking meters on Market as well, after 10 PM.  Becoming ""no parking"" however just seems wrong to me.   It wasn't until 2011 that you were allowed to even be on the street at 2 am   Could you explain that one?  Do you mean in a vehicle or that you weren't even allowed to walk down Market st after 2 am?  In either case I have to ask why?  Is crime that bad on Market after 10PM? Is there a heavy uptick in muggings and gang violence in that area when the sun goes down?  I just don't understand the safety issue that keeps being used as justification.  TL:DR  Thanks a lot for your answers!  I truly do appreciate some input from someone with some true insight as this has been something that's bothered me since I moved here 4 years ago."
Denver,3cpvkv,hankbaumbach,3,Mon Jul 13 22:13:04 2015 UTC,As for the parking after 2am.  No vehicles were allowed to be parked upon the public right of way because of street cleaning activity.  In 2011 it was changed to allow for alternate side parking. As part of that accommodation it instituted paid meter parking 24/6.   http://www.westword.com/news/confusing-overnight-parking-meters-leave-drivers-frustrated-5114302

That said, the underlying issue remains that illegal parking is an ongoing and concerning issue which, if left unchecked will grow into a serious problem for all users.   Ultimately, you are not granted an unlimited free parking space."

Denver,3cpvkv,hankbaumbach,3,Tue Jul 14 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"According to the council-woman I posed this question to a few years ago:  Those areas are high emergency responder areas. They need those lanes clear to move police and medical through the area easily, particularly early in mornings. Because the area is such a high traffic area they need to get the cars out of the way as part of a larger early morning response program."
Denver,3cpvkv,enjo13,2,Fri Jul 10 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for that answer.  I know it wasn't you giving it, but if that were told to me I'd have to ask how often there are medical emergencies on Market or that require Market specifically to be cleared at midnight.  I would love to see the statistics that say Market after midnight turns into a warzone that requires literally every single vehicle on the street to be vacated.  If there was a large hospital or police station at the corner of 19th and Market I would certainly understand that.  I live over by Denver Health and the idea of parking on Bannock overnight between 6th and 8th is ludicrous for that very same reason.  In my very limited experience, I see very few emergency vehicles flying down Market street after midnight.  Also, I cannot fathom why Market is so important and Curtis, Arapahoe or Lawrence are not.  Again, thanks for the answer! I know you can't really reply back on my questions cause you were just reporting what you heard, which I definitely appreciate!"

Denver,3cpvkv,yewdontknowjack,5,Thu Jul 9 20:43:02 2015 UTC,Here's that list of the top 50 parking ticket locations.    Almost $100k in 2014 just from the Denver Zoo and Museum of Nature and Science.
Denver,3cpvkv,SaudiAurora,5,Thu Jul 9 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"I have a love-hate relationship with Denver's parking division.  They do make it easy to park as a resident, keeping vehicles turning over to provide parking space when it's in demand.  They're also not hyper aggressive like some other departments and often give the benefit of the doubt or some flexibility on certain issues.  Other times their agents are totally in the wrong and the appeals process is onerous and focused on getting you to pay immediately (by temporarily reducing the fine) so that you'll give up your right to due process.  Still, having to go fight a parking ticket every couple months beats paying $125 / mo for a spot, so I can't complain too much."
Denver,3cpvkv,rijnzael,4,Fri Jul 10 04:21:28 2015 UTC,"This is great. Denver Parking is more laid back than any other major city, so glad to see revenue coming from peoples inability to read signs."
Denver,3cpvkv,diskx,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"""Just read the signs"". What a shitty answer. The signs in DT are deliberately misleading, use different language for the same rules (or sometimes use the same language for different rules), and can even have different rules on the same block. I understand why we have parking enforcement but to pretend like they aren't implementing policies to catch people on an off day is absurd. Why not just make honest, easy to understand policies and keep them somewhat consistent? For example on some streets parking is free after 8 and is 2 hour metered parking all other times. Easy to understand I suppose, but the signs don't adequately explain that if you park your car there before 8 and pay the meter through 8 you have to move it at 8 or get a ticket, and that on others if you park before 8 and pay your meter through 8 you can stay there until the next morning when parking becomes metered again. Its total horseshit."

Denver,3cpvkv,bluntrollin,24,Fri Jul 10 13:44:25 2015 UTC,"hey give $100 tickets for the dumbest shit!   First thing, there are no $100 tickets. They are $25/$50/$75/$150. So if you received a $100 ticket is was for multiple violations.    I guess the maids figure its a rich neighborhood so fuck these people right?   Parking enforcement is in all neighborhoods in Denver. There is a greater visibility in CCN, and others because there is greater demand for parking. The Strategic Parking Plan is clear in that we are tasked with creating the goals contained therein which is Turn-over and accessibility. Not everyone gets to park in front of their destination.    It's infuriating to receive a $75 ticket because you forgot to put a sticker on your license plate.   Then take it up with your state representatives. The statutes that pertain to the registration display requirements are State of Colorado laws, not Denver ordinances.    I know why most meter maids work the night shift 12am to 8am its because if they worked during the day they would get murdered!   I'm not really interested in pointing out how stupid people are, but this is one of those rare cases where I'm going to.  70.6% of our staff work from 4am-6pm. These hours, in most societies, are considered the day time and while you have an irrational aversion to following some of the simplest of societals laws, you have no idea what you are talking about."

Denver,3cpvkv,IMA_grinder,4,Fri Jul 10 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"Oh my god I parked overnight where they normally do street cleaning   No but if everyone started doing it then they couldn't get the streets clean. You ticket a few people with high priced tickets and they won't park there.   If you park in a residential area or high traffic area for eight hours and start taking up residents spots or spots for shopping traffic (e.g. Cherry Creek) you are causing parking issues. I have enough of a pain in the ass finding parking, so if people took up two hour or meter spots all day it would make parking even harder and I know residents aren't happy to not be able to park in their own neighborhoods. So deter people from doing these things we put up signs and issue people tickets.   The point of parking enforcement is to keep the spots open for people that need them or have a right to them. If you can't follow the signs then park in a garage."
Denver,3cpvkv,HSChronic,5,Thu Jul 9 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"Richard here,  I can absolutely confirm most of us park in private garages. I'd rather pay $5-10 knowing my car won't be ticketed for some ridiculous thing. Front plates are ugly and have no place on an exotic or high end car."
Denver,3cpvkv,COMplex_,7,Thu Jul 9 22:55:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to get a front plate, cause you know it's required and all."
Denver,3cpvkv,diskx,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Private garages easily pay for themselves if you get just one front plate ticket. It's absurd to me. Placing the plate in the window is insufficient for them as well. Must be mounted, etc."
Denver,3cpvkv,COMplex_,4,Thu Jul 9 22:31:25 2015 UTC,The worst are cars that don't come with front plate mounts. I bought my Subaru in Florida and it didn't have places for the front tag because they don't have them. Had to pretty much drill holes in there then work the screws into it.   So yeah if you drive a nice enough car I can see why this would be a pain in the ass. Though it is the law so if you get a no front tag ticket you can't put the blame on Denver Parking.
Denver,3cpvkv,HSChronic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's law so you take that risk. Drill holes to street park or pay to park privately."

Denver,3cpvkv,frostycakes,3,Thu Jul 9 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"Why though?     Colorado registration ends on the last day of the stickered month. Then, in an act of graciousness because Colorado is awesome, they give you 1 whole month of grace period to get it up to date. You can not be cited in the grace period.   However, a temp tag has no grace period. Those expire at 11:59pm on the day on it."
Denver,3cpvkv,DenverMeterMaid,2,Thu Jul 9 23:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'd be less annoyed with my $75 ticket if the state of Colorado was better and sending tags.  I moved once, no renewal was forwarded, didn't remember that a year passed (registration is priority #642 in my life) and then someone gives me a $75 ticket.  I've never gone a week from registration showing up to paying it...but when the state can't get me my registration it's my fault?  Boo your system.  Give me a warning in the month it's about to expire (I know you saw my car)?  Nah, just $75.  Rihanna blasting out that British white jeep ""bitch betta have my money"""
Denver,3cpvkv,drbobstone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"It was for an expired registration.

Denver,3co9y1,santa_slap,20,Fri Jul 10 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Great job on tracking down the responsible party.  Just a note of caution regarding your insurance company.  If your company did actually pay your claim (after deductible), they have an obligation as well as as the legal rights to go after the guy for recovery of their payment, as well as your deductible.  It's the ""subrogation"" portion of your policy.    I will admit that some insurance companies, just like the police department don't have the same passion about recovering damages as you.  If, in this case you didn't have your insurance company step in, then all this doesn't matter, and you can go after dipshit with all guns blazin'.  But if they did, they need to be included in the loop to all of your hard work. Yes, it sucks, but I wouldn't want you to be surprised by their involvement somewhere along the line."

Denver,3co9y1,AntediluvianEmpire,3,Thu Jul 9 16:36:00 2015 UTC,The $500 was the insurance deductible. Demolished was a bit of an exaggeration but the front end needed extensive body and some structural stuff too.

Denver,3co9y1,Semyonov,4,Thu Jul 9 23:06:12 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I bought this Papago dash cam in February and I've been very happy with it.   The new rear view takes some getting used to, as it's more of a wide angle and further away than my stock one, but after using it for several months I'm very happy with it and I'm finding it difficult to go back to stock rear views, as they seem very fisheyed and close-up. I also love the autodimming feature, as my car doesn't have it natively, so it's a nice little add-in.   I don't have any videos to demonstrate its resolution (as I thankfully haven't needed it yet), but as you can see from the Amazon videos, it looks fantastic. I'd actually been considering some other models and via watching some videos found night driving in particular to be muddy and hard to distinguish, so I went with this one, because it was always crisp and clear.   Edit: The one complaint I do have about it is the time. I have to redo the time on the dash cam every now and then, as I've noticed it tends to fall behind. Currently, it's about 6-minutes behind the reported time on my phone."
Denver,3co9y1,COScout,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:34:25 2015 UTC,Is this just a front view camera?
Denver,3co9y1,QuokkaAttack,7,Thu Jul 9 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. I'd considered this one, as it provides both front and rear, but ultimately decided against it as the video quality was grainy and while it seems like a nice feature, doesn't seem wholly necessary. It might be helpful in a case where you're rear-ended and the person flees, but in that case, I'm not sure the camera quality is good enough to actually get the persons plate number, especially in the dark.   I reasoned that most of the dash cam videos I'd seen were strictly from the front and even if you're sitting at a light and get rear ended, it still shows that you weren't at fault, as you're sitting still and then suddenly bumped. Same goes for moving, as if your'e in your lane and then suddenly there's a ""crash"" and your video skews slightly, it's obvious you're not at fault."
Denver,3co9y1,GoPirate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:34 2015 UTC,I purchased the black box GW1 and had the display on the back of the camera go out one. Might look in to this one.   The GW1 is cheap and also has great picture quality. I helped with an arrest of a person because of this footage I got.

Denver,3co9y1,GoPirate,9,Fri Jul 10 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"Glad you got him served. People wanting to go outside of insurance are a big red flag, IMO.  I'm surprised the police didn't come out for the original accident... I've had them respond to non-injury accidents on private property before, but it wasn't in Denver, and I got CSP.  I have a front dashcam in a couple of my vehicles after someone unsuccessfully tried to pull an insurance fraud maneuver on me... I'm thinking more and more about getting rear-facing cams too, given how many times I've nearly been rear-ended."
Denver,3co9y1,FirewhiskyGuitar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:02:27 2015 UTC,Thankfully in rear end collisions it's almost always their fault.
Denver,3co9y1,waspocracy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:32:54 2015 UTC,The problem is proving that they hit you at all. A rear-facing camera works well there.

If the accident only involves property damage: It is a Class 2 misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and $1,000 in fines.  If the accident causes injury to someone: It is a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to 18 months in jail and $5,000 in fines.  If the accident causes serious bodily injury to someone: It is a Class 5 felony punishable by 1 to 3 years in prison and fines reaching $500,000.

Denver,3co9y1,v0rtex-,2,Sun Jul 12 07:57:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes more sense. So essentially if the person does stop and 'exchange' information but then goes radio silent, they're not eligible to be fined by police, just have charges against them payable to the plaintiff."

Also, get the guy to come to the front of the vehicle and do the info swap on your hood, right in front of the Camera. That way you have their face on footage. With that, you just made your case even more air-tight. It's even better if you have audio recording available and leave the windows rolled down. Then, sanding near your drivers window say his name, aloud. ""You're Ronaldo McDickface?"" ""Yep."" Hook. Line. Sinker. Done.  Leverage that camera for all it's worth."

Denver,3cqedu,lostwithoutyou87,40,Fri Jul 10 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll go against the grain here...  Moved here 3 years ago and I'm ready to leave. I think it's a great city but I feel my time here is done. I've seen a lot of what the city and surrounding areas have to offer and I can't quite make myself want to settle down here. The thought of buying a home or starting a family here just makes me uncomfortable. Perhaps it's just personal preference. I consider myself much more comfortable back on the East coast.   I want to say things like the housing market and population rush really bugged me but I don't use those as reasons...If anything, I contributed to that problem. I'll still recommend Denver to anyone but it's not the right city for me."
Denver,3cqedu,canaznguitar,7,Fri Jul 10 02:58:58 2015 UTC,"It has its pros and cons. I moved here for grad school a few years ago for the access to both wilderness and urban life and it was great while I was in school. But, now that I work 9-5 I find the mountains get too crowded on weekends and the city events/attractions aren't nearly as interesting compared to other big cities.  Still, traffic is worse and life is more expensive in other cities and I can still find some good adventures if I look a little harder and plan a little better. In that sense, Denver is still the best place for me."
Denver,3cqedu,skeuser,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:01:03 2015 UTC,Have you tried doing stuff outside of the I-70 corridor?  During the summer I never have any issues on 285 down south or 119 out of Boulder.  Tons of cool things to do off of 'em.  In the winter.....we're fucked hahaha.
Denver,3cqedu,bachwasbaroque,13,Fri Jul 10 14:47:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Every single person I talk to loves Denver. I moved out here about 8 months and cannot figure out why. It's just another big city. I'm trying to keep a positive outlook but I've just plateaued.  I had moment while hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park where I was in awe of nature but the mountains aren't Denver. I could live somewhere else and fly out here to hike if I so chose. I don't know, maybe I need more more and some really good friends to change my perspective.   P.S. The rent is too damn high."
Denver,3cqedu,ndrew452,12,Fri Jul 10 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"That is why I find Denver so appealing.  If I want to go hiking, it's less than an hour away.  I don't have to fly there, I just hop in my car and go.   Denver isn't in the mountains, mountain living isn't all it's cracked up to be.  But its close enough where you get the perks of living in an urban area while still being able to enjoy nature.   The rent in the city of Denver is fairly high, but the suburbs have very reasonable rent.  But still, when you compare rent to other urban areas, it is either on par or lower.  Unless you move to the rust belt or certain areas in the south, you won't see lower rents."
Denver,3cqedu,AntediluvianEmpire,5,Fri Jul 10 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the reasonable rents.   Not including Denver itself, rent has been increasing all over; I grew-up in Louisville and about five years or so ago now, my parents were pushed out due to increasing rents. They've been pushed further and further north, from Louisville to Lafayette to now bumfuck Erie, because their rent continues to increase and become pretty unreasonable.   Even on the fringe of Denver, areas like Longmont are becoming prohibitively expensive for people."
Denver,3cqedu,enjo13,5,Fri Jul 10 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"That isn't really responding to his point. Rents are rising in almost every major metropolitan area, it's not a uniquely Denver phenomenon. Although it does make really big cities like Chicago more attractive (where rent has remained relatively stable as they have a LOT of inventory).  You're seeing this same discussion play out in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco (far more extreme), Austin... just about everywhere.   When you compare Denver to 2008, ya rent is sky-high. When you compare it to other similar cities, the picture is a bit murkier."
Denver,3cqedu,emeryor,2,Fri Jul 10 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Denver surpassed Portland and Austin. Median 1 bedroom here is $1,351 and in Portland it's $1,209 and in Austin it's $1,155. When I was last in Portland, I was surprised to see it was much cheaper.   In some pockets rent here is comparable to places like Seattle but obviously not SF. A new building just went up by my house and 750 square foot 1 bedrooms are listed at $2,600, and this is not LODO but a central but peripheral area more like Uptown or the Highlands."
Denver,3cqedu,bachwasbaroque,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:56 2015 UTC,You're right. The rent is pretty much on par with other large cities. Thanks for putting that into perspective with the mountains. I guess I never thought of it like thought. Thanks!
Denver,3cqedu,FirewhiskyGuitar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:05:44 2015 UTC,"Denver rent is on par than other cities, but as much as I love living here, I have to admit that at least those other cities (like San Fran, Austin) have a lot more to offer. Denver is pretty high for what it is.  Of course, for me it's worth it due to the nature side, but it's still something to consider."
Denver,3cqedu,boot20,6,Sun Jul 12 08:10:40 2015 UTC,"Moving to Denver was an interesting experience.  I moved from the Bay Area to here.  I miss a lot about the Bay Area, but Denver is actually kind of similar in a lot of ways.    The Good:   Great weather (generally).  Sure we get snow and rain, but at least we get snow and rain.  It kind of sucks to always live at 65 degrees.  It's nice to have seasons Friendly people.  Most people are pretty darn friendly.  I'm not just talking about service people, I went to get smogged and the smog guy was the nicest guy about everything.  He even pointed out a great little place to have lunch.     The pace of life.  A lot of people are transplants and tend to realize the pace of life in Denver is less New York and more California....Which is cool.   In the Bay Area a lot of the east coast transplants are ruining the nice thing we have going. Awesome outdoorsy stuff.  I mean you have mountains, rivers, lakes, skiing, hiking, camping...all of it.  Plus, in the fall it is crazy pretty. Good produce.  I know it's kinda funky, but I expected shitty produce.  The Inland Empire made some awesome fruits and veggies, but I gotta say, the local stuff here is down right delicious.  Who knew Colorado grew some of the best peaches!?   Great craft beer scene.  'Nuff said. Denver is a pretty big city (what like 3 million people) that you can actually escape from.  You can drive a couple hours in any direction and find somewhere quiet.   The Bad:   16th Street Mall weed smoking is fucking gross.  I don't care if you smoke weed, whatever...but whole shit, it's like going to a Grateful Dead concert down there.   Parking Nazis.  Holy shit, I thought SF and Oakland were bad....They've got nothing on the vultures downtown.  I parked kinda of near comic con to visit someone, and watched as the meter maids circled like vultures.  That wasn't the first time or the only time.... Some people turn into douche bags when you say you are from California.  I'm not rich, I couldn't afford a house in CA, I'm not a .com millionaire. Ski area bros.  Ug...   The Ugly:   FUCKING POT HOLES.  Holy shit, the entire Denver Metro must have a pot hole monster.  I mean honestly.  I've never seen worse streets and I've driven up and down I5.   Shitty drivers in the snow.  I mean honestly, at least get all season tires and drive a little slower.  If everyone is going down I25 at 40 mph, you just may want to slow down from 75.... My fucking idiotic school board (Jeff Co).  Fuck those pricks.  They are a microcosm of all the problems with education in America.   I25 and I70 are a cluster fuck.  I feel like that construction on I25 has been going on forever.    Six Flags over Jesus...er...Colorado Springs trying to influence my town (see Jeff Co school board).  Stay in the Springs and pass your idiotic laws there."
Denver,3cqedu,iamacontrarian,5,Fri Jul 10 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"FUCKING POT HOLES. Holy shit, the entire Denver Metro must have a pot hole monster. I mean honestly. I've never seen worse streets and I've driven up and down I5.   Holy fucking shit.  If you see a pothole, call 311 and report it.  The weather fluctuations in Colorado make potholes a huge problem.  If you report it, it will be fixed within about 48 hours.  Complaining on reddit doesn't solve any pothole problems.  Calling the people that will fix them is way more productive.  edit:  CDOT practically begs people to report potholes."
Denver,3cqedu,boot20,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do that.  However, the 48 hour rule is only for Denver and not the whole metro area.  Also, I have lived in other cold weather areas that don't have the same pot hole problem we do.  The roads here are just generally ill maintained and that gives rise to the bigger problems we have with pot holes."
Denver,3cqedu,iamacontrarian,4,Fri Jul 10 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"It's not the cold weather that's the problem.  It's the weather fluctuations.  There are very few places in the US where the weather will shift 80 degrees in the course of 24 hours.  Simple physics explains why asphalt doesn't deal with those temperature changes very well.  CDOT does an absolutely amazing job of dealing with roads in Colorado, but if you're going to live here, you need to realize that road conditions are not always going to be perfect.  You could throw trillions of dollars at CDOT and the climate will still win."

Denver,3cqedu,amber0517,5,Fri Jul 10 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"There are so many things to love and hate about Denver, but I come out on the ""I can't imagine leaving"" area. The below is 100% just my opinion....  I moved here two years ago and was immediately attracted to the city and the idea of the mountains and skiing being under 3 hours away. It was easy for Denver to become ""home"" really. The thing about Denver is everyone here is a go-getter, they want to go, go, go... whether it's a ski trip, a trip to Utah, a concert on a Wednesday at 11pm, brunch, etc... constant money and need for entertainment. I think that's one of the love/hates I have. I love that i've got someone around me willing to plan an """"""adventure"""""", but I also hate how much ""FOMO"" is in the air when it comes to that stuff. I remember being booked solid for 6 months. That's nice, but being lazy is nice too.   I think it's really hard to make GIRLfriends out here, personally. I'm kinda a girls girl. I love shopping and gossiping and sometimes I like reality TV, girls here don't care about shoes or their hair, and that's cool sometimes, but at times I wish I had THAT girl. I'm sure it can be just as bad for guys.  Sometimes I feel like I live in the land of aged teenagers. No one here cares to grow up. Denver is full of aged professionals still petitioning for 4am bar times. On one end it's fun to keep the spirit, on the other it's sometimes too much. But, I imagine you get that in a lot of places, so whatever, can't blame the city too much.  I'd complain about rent here, but you guys have taken care of that. The rent sucks.  Natives can be entitled assholes. I've never met a city/state that prides itself so much on being a Native, so much that they make a sticker for your car.  A lot of my """"""anger"""""" comes from the fact that i'm an old woman in a 27 year olds body. I just like sleep and skiing equally, tbh and I kinda hate that 14'r is a word. ha.  But, as I said before... wouldn't change where I live at all. I really love this city and the people I HAVE let into my life here are some of the greatest people. I've grown up a lot and I am always excited to show a friend around and i'm ALWAYS ready to try a new place to eat (another huge positive are the restaurants)"

Denver,3cqedu,pop-rox,4,Wed Jul 15 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"I  moved here two years ago on the 15th (in a few days) from Dallas. I was so unbelievably depressed and I didn't like Dallas; it can be quite superficial. My dog couldn't go for walks because of the heat and humidity. Now, I've lost weight, am no longer depressed, my dog loves it here, and I take every opportunity to walk somewhere or take the bus/lightrail. I didn't move here for the weed or skiing. I moved here for me. To get better, and I have. I love the views you get here too. So beautiful. I never liked Texas growing up.

Denver,3cqedu,King_Chochacho,3,Fri Jul 10 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Been here about 6 years now, and I'm glad we got in when we did.  The popularity explosion of the Denver area has brought some good and some bad, but mostly it's been really interesting to watch from an inside/outside perspective.    At the end of the day, I'm just glad to have finally found a place that I don't think I'll ever get tired of.  Seeing those mountains still hasn't lost any magic, and it's the first place I've lived where I'm always glad to come home, even after a really awesome vacation.  Also, people visit us now.  Nobody visits you in Houston."
Denver,3cqedu,waspocracy,4,Fri Jul 10 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to add perspective from someone that's been here just about 25 years or so.  Pros:   Hiking trails are everywhere and I didn't care until my early 20's The Norway of America with its beautiful scenery Rivers for rafting Beer Market was rather sustainable during the recession People are generally kind, but not Texas kind Deep blue skies and marvelous sunsets Grocery stores are always convenient Walmarts up the ass for those 12am runs Rather liberal politics, even the Republicans are generally liberal CDOT does awesome work in the winters Great upstart opportunities for businesses Red Rocks (amphitheater and the area) A lot of concert venues Jazz clubs Good food and diverse restaurants Plenty of nice golf courses Broncos, Avs, and sometimes Nuggets/Rapids Moderate weather year round Rent income is increasing Legalization of weed brings much needed income to our education system (not a pot-smoker though, so I don't care about being able to use it) Downtown has everything you need if you're the kind of person that likes being in the city (I'm not) Better education program than most of the country (not saying much)   Cons:   Fucking apartments are popping up everywhere and adding traffic to what used to be quiet suburbs Living costs are soaring (but more manageable than Cali and tri-state area) Rent is up Buying new property is becoming an auction + bribery Difficult job market Colorado Rockies Evening traffic is getting worse, but not Turnpike bad (bright side) Drivers cut you off constantly Drivers on your ass constantly Denver pollution is getting worse due to volume of vehicles Coors Green Peace off 16th street mall Homeless people every major block, even out in the suburbs Parking downtown is ridiculous and so is using the light rail for a single trip   I probably won't ever leave unless our paid politicians begin to really fuck us.

Denver,3cqedu,Dr_Facilier,6,Fri Jul 10 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"Moved out here one year and 9 days ago. Didnt know anyone, no family, nothing to land on, so to speak, except work.   Loving it so far. I make double what I did where I  came from, really enjoy my job. Love the city and outdoors atmosphere.  I don't have any friends that aren't work related yet, but that's par for the course with my profession (just takes time).   If the real estate market could choke down a handful of Alprazolam, everything would be outstanding."
Denver,3cqedu,supremechairumpire,3,Fri Jul 10 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle, don't love it and don't hate it. I have a balanced mix of people in my life who are on one side or the other.   On one side I've got my wife who brought us here, does not like it, and frequently lists reasons as to why. She's a dermatologist and scared my cousin away by warning her that Denverites age in ""Denver years,"" which is to say a year here is equivalent to two years elsewhere, due to the intense solar radiation and dry air--and she used to practice in Florida so she knows her sun damage and it is really bad here, especially among skiers and hikers, even among those who use sunblock. Just an example of the random stuff that bugs me and has me checking my rapidly deepening crow's feet all the time and questioning Denver.  On the other side, I have lots of colleagues who moved here from places like Kansas, Ohio, Michigan and Oklahoma, and all seem to be fanatical lovers of all things Denver. Many of them plan to stay so I believe it's obviously working out for them and it's nice to see them so happy and it's infectious, though I do wonder if some of them know beer and mountains are in other places too.  For me, I like the proximity to the mountains, the low cost of living and the lack of pretense. Denver has treated me well. I know people feel Denver has become really hip but I find it to be lacking culture, in spite of being pretty good for a third-tier city or whatever it's categorized as. The result of that is that you do not meet many sophisticated or bohemian people or people from diverse backgrounds. I'm missing the ocean badly so cannot stay here forever. I also think the increased crowding and the projections of future population growth are a real downer, especially since roads to the mountains like 70 are only going to get worse."
Denver,3cqedu,SpandauBalls,2,Fri Jul 10 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what sunscreen do dermatologists use?"
Denver,3cqedu,supremechairumpire,2,Sun Jul 12 09:15:49 2015 UTC,"We're using Badger right now but have used many in the past. It can get really complicated, as there is often a pro and con to every option or ingredient--like organics are appealing but then usually have oxybenzone which is no good, or create reactive oxygen species when exposed to sun (which happens in your skin anyway).  Her top advice is:  -limit exposure, especially at peak hours  -don't slack when it's cold or cloudy, especially in the mountains  -wear a hat, whether male or female, and layers  -get strong UVA and UVB protection  -waterproof sunscreen is largely useless  -apply your sunscreen every two hours or less  -don't trust a single brand--like a top brand can have good and bad lotions  I'm probably forgetting some things but that's the cheatsheet wrap that comes to mind."
Denver,3cqedu,SpandauBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:45:29 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That's a ton of good info I'll keep in mind. I heard in one of my classes that every 1000 ft in elevation above sea level adds 8% of UV exposure as opposed to at sea level so Colorado's getting 40% more than say California.
Denver,3cqedu,chinook65,3,Wed Jul 15 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the awesome posts so far! This has been a surprisingly uplifting thread. With all the griping I see on the sub about this and that I guess deep down we do really love this city.   I moved here from Chicago about 3 years ago and it's worked out incredibly. I'm miles ahead of where I was 3 years ago and I'm much happier in general. I think I'm in the same boat as a lot of you with not having many friends since moving out here. Someone else mentioned that it's because everyone is busy 'doing Colorado stuff' and I find that so true. Where I used to look forward to going out with lots of friends on the weekends, now what I really want to do is go up into the mountains with my dog and my girlfriend. I was kinda getting down on myself about not having more friends out here yet a while ago, because I used to be the opposite way, but I finally realized that if I'm happy that's all that really matters. I'm sure in time I'll build up some good Colorado buds too, I'm not worried about it or really anything anymore for that matter..."
Denver,3cqedu,black_pepper,3,Fri Jul 10 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"I moved to Colorado from Boston in '04 with my wife and then on to Western Canada in '11. My favorite things about Colorado were the unmatched beauty of the land (Mountains, Deserts, Plains), Garden of the Gods, The drive across I-70 to Grand Junction (and into Utah), the weather and the cheaper cost of living compared to the Northeast. And definitely the skiing at Winter Park and MJ were great.  I had a rough go with jobs. Seemed every job I had was worse than the next and I got tired of hopping from one job to the next. This was during the '08 meltdown. It was stressful...  We met some very friendly people and a few absolute nutballs while we were there. I suppose that's anywhere you go. I didn't care too much for downtown Denver. It was hard to compare with Boston. Apples and Oranges...  The bottom line is that something just didn't feel right about Colorado for us at the time. Whether it was our cookie-cutter house in the burbs, or not having family around when we started having kids, who knows...  so we left with the realization that we could always move back if we wanted to.  If you have the opportunity, go for it."
Denver,3cqedu,AnonymousChicken,5,Fri Jul 10 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Lots of positive stories here. I'll provide a bit different perspective. I moved here about 13 years ago. I never felt attached to Denver. I tried to leave twice. Each time resulted in failure and I ended up back in Denver again. I've accepted Denver for what it is. I don't love it and think its heaven on earth like many do but I own a house now and don't plan to leave any time soon. I would not be opposed to living in certain other parts of the world though.
Denver,3cqedu,epidemic,4,Fri Jul 10 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"Finally, I'm useful!  I moved here from Vancouver, WA with an 18% raise (same company, higher tier, otherwise same job). I arrived in late March. I should note that flying out here to scan the rental scene and find a place sight-seen was the best thing I could have done.  I should say my costs went up a lot more than that 18% raise. My commute to work went up 5 minutes a day, and my commute home went up 25 minutes a day.  I had some setbacks. Mostly related to just not connecting with people here for whatever reason. I mostly stick with old friends that ended up here and their friends and my coworkers. I'm typing this alone at a bar around the corner from my apartment.  The weather this year has been a big disappointment. I escaped the Pacific Northwest for 300 days of sunshine. At this rate, I'll be lucky to see 30. I did live here in 99-00, and it was much nicer in the summer weather department.  Otherwise... despite my personal difficulties, it's good here. The long drive to Black Hawk casinos is kinda fun. Being closer to 'the West' is intriguing. I have a lot to explore here still. I might still find a way to connect to the locals. Might even find love here, who knows.   I may still go to Phoenix for a better paying job in a cheaper market, but if I stay here, things might be pretty decent! I'll probably need a better paying job, though.  Hope that is what you're looking for."

Denver,3cqedu,richard_banger303,15,Fri Jul 10 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things I like about Denver, and there are a lot of things I don't.  Things I like:   The weather during the summer time is very mild, compared to other places I've lived. The view of the Rockies is scenic. There's a free mall ride, as well as a light rail system (although it has limited coverage and still doesn't even go to the airport yet). Services like Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, Driz.ly, and grocery delivery services are prolific (although this comes with the territory of being a major city). If you live downtown, you don't really even need to own a car. My internet speed from Comcast is pretty fast - 120 megabits for like $75 a month. There is a pretty big tech and startup scene (which is kind of my thing). Colorado is politically progressive, which I'm a big fan of. Weed is legal, and the craft beer scene is huge. Salaries are higher here for my career path than in many other cities (although so are living expenses, so it's kind of a wash). There are tons of attractive, fit people, so there is plenty of nice scenery, I guess.   Things I dislike:   The lack of oxygen from the altitude means my car literally makes like 50 less horsepower (and technically, you are starving your brain of oxygen and killing brain cells just by living here). The rent and home prices suck. Traffic on i25 and i70 seems to have doubled over the past two years. When I lived in DTC and was commuting to downtown, it would often take an hour just to make the (normally) 15 minute drive. People don't know how to fucking drive. Nobody understands the notion of safe following distances or how to use their goddamn blinkers. As a result, they are CONSTANTLY getting into rear-end crashes, which causes the ridiculous traffic. There are no reflectors on the roads (because of snowplows), so if it's raining you can hardly even see the lines half the time. Every single girl on the various dating sites seems to only be interested in one thing: Hot, fit guys, who enjoy hiking, camping, the outdoors, going to bars, and going to watch the Rockies play baseball. I hate doing pretty much all of those things, and I'm a somewhat overweight (200 lbs) computer nerd, so I'm single, which sucks. I finally just deleted all of my online dating profiles and said ""fuck it"". Basically, there are a TON of attractive women who aren't interested in me, who love doing things that I hate. Homeless people are everywhere downtown, and the City of Denver doesn't seem to want to actually solve the problem. It's basically illegal to be homeless (you can get arrested for ""camping"" outside in the city), and then they get stuck in a vicious cycle. I live near a couple of homeless shelters and I basically drive past crowds of them every single day. Parking downtown is absolutely awful. There are a number of good restaurants and bars there, but I don't want to pay $25 to park for 3 hours! For being a ""high tech city"", Denver only has one real computer parts store - a small Micro Center down in DTC, that takes an hour to drive to in traffic. Sometimes I miss Phoenix, Arizona, which had not one, but two GIANT Fry's Electronics super-stores. During the winter, it snows (obviously), and tons of accidents occur (meaning traffic is awful) and things are pretty miserable. It would be nice to live somewhere where the weather was mild, but it didn't snow.   The only real friends I have are my co-workers, and out of them all, the only one that is really my best friend is my buddy who persuaded me to move here, but he's too busy with his married life to hang out. So yeah, I've been living here for 2 years and all I really have is one friend. Everyone else is just co-workers and acquaintances. Everyone is just so caught up in their lives and doing ""Colorado things"". I have a hard time relating and making friends with them all, I guess.  Maybe I'm just doing the whole Denver thing wrong?"

Denver,3cqedu,captainlvsac,13,Fri Jul 10 21:59:17 2015 UTC,"If your car has a fuel-injection system, it will automatically adjust for the change in altitude.  Whatever lack of power you perceive is in your head.    You aren't ""starving your brain"" for oxygen.  There is more than enough oxygen at 5000ft to function properly.  Your body in turn makes more red blood cells to compensate.  This is why you feel great when you go to lower altitudes, because suddenly more oxygen exists and you have all these red blood cells to absorb it.    It sounds like being from Phoenix just makes you hate winter.  Accidents happen all the time in every major city with snow.  It isn't unique to Denver.  Denver's winter are mild compared to winters on the east coast because over there, the snow doesn't melt.  It just keeps on piling up until spring.  Here, you wait 3 days and it's gone."
Denver,3cqedu,t0mbstone,6,Sun Jul 12 05:57:50 2015 UTC,Fuel injection corrects the air/fuel ratio by reducing the amount of fuel your engine gets at higher altitude. Less fuel and less oxygen = less power. Cars with turbos or superchargers feel this effect less.
Denver,3cqedu,lowtempshighterps,5,Fri Jul 10 14:01:12 2015 UTC,"You may be right about the human body aspect, but I know for a fact that my sport car has a dramatic loss in power here, as I actually had it measured on a dyno both here and at a lower altitude.  This is also partially due to the fact that all you can buy here is 91 octane gas, while at lower altitudes you can buy 93 octane.  I have talked to a number of tuners and they all tell me the same thing. Your car will typically have anywhere from 10-20% less power here in Denver than at lower altitudes. For a 400 horsepower car, that can easily translate to 30-50 hp loss."

I met my wife about eight years ago now on OkCupid, she was a person who worked out six days a week and was looking for open minded, fit, athletic and hard working dudes. What struck up our initial conversation was me asking if her if she thought her expectations were unrealistic and the rest is history.   People are willing to compromise and it's very true that opposites attract. There were many years of our lives where she would go out to a party or hang out with her friends, workout, etc, which allowed me to stay inside and game. Plus, she's taught me that I actually like a few things I didn't think I would.   Also, I agree with you about Microcenter, though I generally just get everything off Amazon anyway.

Recessed reflectors would fix that problem.  The problem is that asphalt expands rapidly during temperature shifts (faster than plastic) and reflectors pop out of the road... then cause debris damage.

Denver,3cqedu,HSChronic,5,Fri Jul 10 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"Moved from Tucson in April for work, and it's been good. I haven't been here through a winter yet, but I don't anticipate any major problems.    Have an ice scraper in your car.  I repeat, have an ice scraper in your car.  Housing is ridiculously expensive compared to where I moved from.  My rent more than doubled.  In addition to the sticker price, everything is separate -- sewer, water, parking, trash -- and those were all included where I used to live.  Don't assume that parking spaces are included if you're checking out apartments.  And don't assume that the free-for-all spots actually will have any open spaces, ever.  Having a garage is really nice.  Because, you know, snow.  Weather is much more unpredictable here.  In Tucson, it was ""Sunny, clear or scattered clouds"" for 300 days a year, and you'd get a half-hour thunderstorm every day in August.  Here, it might be fine in the morning and colder and snowing at noon.  You actually have to pay attention to weather reports.  People here were whining about it being hot when it's 89 degrees.   In Tucson, we called that ""March"".  I guess that gives me some wiggle room whining about snow this winter.  I definitely notice the altitude -- We had a fire alarm and I had to walk down and right back up 5 flights of stairs, and it took quite a while to catch my breath.  The people here I've talked to who've moved here say it takes about a year to fully acclimatize to the altitude.  Some people have trouble sleeping for the first few weeks, but that hasn't been an issue for me at least.  Fuck the DMV.  It took six hours to get car registration and a driver's license.      It matters what county you're in.  I didn't realize, as I've never lived near a county border before, and I'm getting state license and registration... Still don't understand why the hell this matters, but they didn't mention it until they'd made me wait in line twice. The smog place isn't at the DMV.  It may not even be close. Get car smogged first.  (In AZ at least, you get the car smogged AT the DMV and you can do it after) While you're there, get the VIN verification.  AZ does that shit at the DMV by getting up from their desks and walking out to the car, but in CO you have to take the car to the smog place or a car dealer.  They didn't tell me this until my third trip to the DMV. Some DMVs don't do drivers licenses.  What?  That was trip #4. Don't go until you have a bill from utilities or cable service at your new address.  They wouldn't give me a DL without it.  A bill from my insurance company with my address on it wasn't good enough.  That was trip #5. They may or may not take your out-of-state license as valid enough to get an in-state license.  They sent me away saying I needed something more. I brought a passport, and then they told me they didn't need it.  That was trip #6.  I've never wanted to choke a bitch so badly before...  It was her second day on the job and apparently their training is ""on the job"". Front plates are required, so if you don't already have front plates, you may need to get brackets.   Regular Unleaded gas is 85 octane. If your car is finicky, you might need to go up a grade.    There's tons of good food around, but they have no idea what Mexican food is.  I may have been spoiled by living an hour from the Mexican border before...  There's probably good places, but I haven't found em yet.  Lots of good Indian food, lots of good Pho.  Thai food has been okay but I'm spoiled from when I lived in CA.    People here are bizarrely proud of the mountains.  They're nice and all, but they aren't that impressive to look at from Denver.  If you happen to live in Colorado Springs, then it's impressive.  Going TO them, sure, awesome.  But just IN Denver? Meh.  Maybe they're super-cool if you lived in Kansas or something, I don't know.  Craft beer here is absolutely amazing!  Tons of it, and it's high quality.  Not a pot smoker, but I know it's pseudo-legal here.  So far, I've only run into one guy who was clearly stoned out of his mind, admiring the fountain drink machine at Taco Bell.  Dispensaries are apparently everywhere, but I've never gone looking and I've only actually noticed one.  Traffic sucks around rush hour.    Road quality is poor, probably because of snow and freeze/thaw cycles.  Having moved from places where it doesn't snow, I was amazed by the number and size of potholes.    Given the level of the tech industry in this city, there are hardly any DIY places or places for components.  There's a Micro Center place in the tech center, but the prices are terrible and the selection is meh.  I miss having a cheap place nearby that sells HDMI cables for $5.99 and stuff like that."

My job pays enough to afford to live here, which is good because my rent is nearly tripple what I paid in Nebraska.  I freaking love the mountains. I snowboard in the winter as much as possible (18 days this past winter). I'm hiking the shit out of stuff with my GF and planning some 14'ers with a friend I met playing Ultimate.  Denver has multiple Ultimate leagues, lots of Disc Golf, and I'm a 1-2 hour drive from so much awesome I've barely scratched the surface.    I'm fortunate to have family here: A cousin who's introduced me to serveral friends, and a brother who ended up moving to Boston, but also introduced me to his network of friends. So I have lots of connections already, which is a key part of making a life in a new place.  So although I'm going to tout CO as the greatest place in the world, I have a lot of things going for me that aren't available to everyone, including family, a good paying job, established connections, and interests that are supported by the community where I live.

Denver,3cqedu,emeryor,2,Fri Jul 10 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Prior to living in Denver, I was in the Air Force and stationed in Cheyenne.  So I knew what Denver/Colorado was all about and loved it.  I knew this is where I wanted to live.  After I got out, I made the worst mistake of my life and got a job out in New Jersey.  I hated it.  Fortunately, I got a transfer to a position out here in Denver.   I very much enjoy living in Denver.  The weather is fantastic (even though this recent rain is no good).  I go to the mountains all the time and love the craft beer market.  But, I expected all this because I lived in Cheyenne for so long.    What I will say to people who complain about rent/traffic/blah blah:  I've lived in 5 states including California and New Jersey.  Denver rental prices are either on par or below other highly desirable places to live.  Yes, they have increased dramatically over the past few years, but so has Austin, Portland, and Seattle.  If you want to live in a nice area, you have to pay for it.  Otherwise, move to Cleveland and pay $600/month for a 2 bedroom apartment or just buy a 3 BR house for $100,000.  Except now, you live in Cleveland and have to rely on a LeBron James based economy.  (I'm originally from there, so that is why I am giving it shit, it's really not a bad town).    Yea traffic sucks, but you know what, traffic sucks in a lot of metropolitan areas.  When I lived in California, it took me 2 hours to travel 10 miles around the 101 and 405 interchange.  When I lived in New Jersey, I avoided traveling anywhere between 7:30 - 9am and 4pm - 6pm.  One time I visited a friend in Princeton and took county roads the whole way (to avoid traffic).  The 20 mile drive took me 45 minutes because of traffic.  If I took the highways, it would have taken me an hour plus.  I've been frustrated about getting caught in traffic here, but I've experienced a lot worse.  The point of this is, is that Denver is now very similar to other major populated areas, it isn't the only where rent is high and traffic is bad."

Denver,3cqedu,madbeetzyo,2,Fri Jul 10 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"It's been about 4 months for me now - moved here from Iowa. I lined up a job that had a more than 30% pay increase from my previous job, which is great. It has nothing to do with Denver itself, but about the only thing I've liked about the job so far is the pay and the free beer at happy hour every Thursday. I'm doing work that is beneath my abilities and it's starting to frustrate me.  As far as Denver itself, I moved out here for the mountains, the weather, wanted to be in a bigger city, change of pace, et cetera. Maybe I don't like to admit it, but the legal herb was icing on the cake, too.   When I was moving out here, I had a feeling like I was making a game changing move and was going to experience bliss all the time. While I have loved heading up to the mountains almost every weekend on my motorcycle, the daily commute feels like a grind after living in a smallish city in Iowa. I also love the craft brewery scene. However, the bums on every corner, trash in every gutter & median, traffic and all that make me like Denver a lot less than I thought I would. There's a difference between homeless and bums by the way - lots of the ""homeless"" out here are not down on their luck or suffering from mental illness, but rather have chosen a lifestyle of begging and substance abuse. Honestly, it makes me angry when I see other drivers giving them money, enabling their lifestyle. I would complain about rent or high real estate prices, but I knew about that before I came and my higher salary more than makes up for this. I do feel sorry for people that don't have jobs affording them the ability to live in a place that they would like... I would certainly be resentful of all the educated/well paid transplants driving up living costs if I was a native. I also haven't really made any friends yet (my own fault for being introverted), which exacerbates my negative feelings.  TLDR : I will never get tired of the mountains and the beautiful scenery Colorado has to offer, but Denver itself has been a letdown."

Plusses:    Disc Golf Best snow in the world. You aren't going to find many places in the world where you get the snow we do. It isn't that icy heavy east coast shit, and it isn't the wet west coast shit.  Breweries and Beer - Never really liked beer that much then I moved out here and end up drinking more than I would like sometimes. Mountains - hiking, drives, scenery etc Get paid good for what I do because out here people will pay me what I am worth Activities - an abundance of them if you like the outdoors   Minuses:   You meet a lot of people to do things with but not a lot of people that all do the same things, so you end up with a lot of people you know but not a lot of close friends because of the different activities you do in different seasons The housing prices are too damn high (the rent isn't that bad if you don't live downtown) The fucking hail, seriously fuck you hail Too much shit to do, there is so much shit to do you can't do it all It costs a lot of money to do the activities you like and you can't use stuff from one for another, so if I want to rock climb, white water kayak, mountain bike and snowboard I have to buy shit for them all Traffic   really though most of the minuses are just pet peeves"
Denver,3cqedu,iknowthepiecesfit,2,Fri Jul 10 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"After living in Minneapolis for about 8 years, I moved to Denver (Cap Hill) almost two months ago.   So far, it's been great, and I'm eager to explore the city and of course the mountains. People here seem pretty friendly, without hardly knowing anyone it seems to be pretty easy to spark up conversations with just about anyone. The urban bike scene seems comparable to MPLS, I got into mountain biking (I'm still a noob) but it's a thrill for sure. Loving all the breweries. Anyone want to bike & grab beers? There are still plenty of breweries I need to check out.  On the flip side, the homeless are pretty bad and can get annoying (especially when they camp outside your building). It seems like littering is more of an issue here than in MPLS. Beating a dead horse; the traffic, parking (especially in Cap Hill), and rent are all pretty awful as well and I'm sure people like me aren't helping the situation.  Overall, Denver is pretty rad...That's the lingo here right?"
Denver,3cqedu,FootballBat,2,Fri Jul 10 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"My husband and I moved here a year ago from the Chicago area with no jobs. We both found amazing positions within a couple weeks of moving here, and actually work in the same building right across the hall from one another. We just moved into an amazing new place closer to work and could not be happier. We enjoy the mountains much more than the flat boring plains of Illinois. I can't imaging leaving now, we feel we are at home finally."
Denver,3cqedu,donthemonk,2,Fri Jul 10 20:50:48 2015 UTC,Work moved me out here a year ago next Friday. We could not be happier with the city: it reminds my wife and I of Seattle 10 years ago (that's a good thing).  The job on the other hand sucks donkey balls.
Denver,3cqedu,FootballBat,2,Sat Jul 11 04:17:35 2015 UTC,Similiar except I asked my job. Two years now. It's pretty great. My kids school is phenomenal. Great weather(not lately). Friendly people and a slower pace of life. I haven't seen my mom in two years but other than that it the Best. Jobs been pretty cool about me leaving management to work part-time(with my salaried benefits) which is pretty nice too.

Denver,3cqedu,Sandsworth,3,Thu Jul 9 23:53:05 2015 UTC,"Moved out here with my wife a while back. Been just over four years now.   I like it. Finding work was easy, had a job within a few weeks of moving. Place to live was difficult. Lived out of a hotel for two months before moving into a shitty studio apartment. Six months later a shitty apartment with thin walls, elephants above me, subwoofers on every side, and party boy downstairs, it was hell for the next twelve months. Only slept for two or three hours most nights, wanted to die. And was on a night shift for most of that time.  Finally, moved into a decent ground level apartment with concrete subflooring (yay, I can lift weights at home!). It's been good here. Decent commute to into Denver by bus or car, reasonable neighbors. Only one or two are dicks, but the walls are so thick and sound reducing I don't give a shit, I don't hear them and sleep fine now. Management kind of sucks, but it's okay, better than any other apartment or house I've lived in the last decade or so."
Denver,3cqedu,rubbersoul93,4,Fri Jul 10 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"Moved from Florida 6 years ago because my wife got into grad school out here.

It's a little hard at first but that's how moving goes. I won't be going anywhere for sure unless something drastic changes in my life.
Denver,3cqedu,EmcOnTheRocks,4,Fri Jul 10 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Moved here in November 2014.  It's been one of the best things I've done.     Went from a 2.5 hour train commute into center city Philly every day to a 1 hour bus ride when traffic is heavy. We went hiking all winter long, and I prefer winter hiking since the trails are less crowded. Have a great house with low taxes (compared to back east) and a yard for our pitty. Got referred to a great doc in the CU health system that has really helped me out a lot. I transferred for work, so I had that covered, but my wife found work quickly and absolutely loves it.

Denver,3cqedu,TACOUNT,2,Fri Jul 10 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"Moved down from Anchorage, Alaska in January.  Broke my heart to leave Alaska, but was getting burned out at work up there and Denver's always been a top 5 choice for me.  First off, STOP.  RAINING.  I know this weather is just anathema to what Denver's all about, and it's driving me crazy.  And it always seems to kick in right as I'm getting off work.  I somewhat knew about the afternoon thunderstorms, but this is way above and beyond what I saw coming.  How have you outdoorsy types not gone insane yet?  That aside, dear God this city is full of stuff.  Food, bars, breweries, stores, parks, you name it.  I had moments where I was walking down Colfax or downtown thinking ""This is just an embarrassment of riches.  I'm gonna be here a while.  And there's a whole state beyond Denver too.""  I can absolutely see myself staying a while.  Maybe even for good.  And the people!  I was taken aback the first time a Target cashier asked me what I was doing for the upcoming weekend.  Alaska people go there because they want to be left alone.  I have a touch of introversion myself, but I can't help but applaud how friendly and engaging people are here.  I haven't seen anything like them anywhere I've been.  Pulled off probably the quickest settling in period in human history.  Rented a shoebox 1 bedroom for four months sight unseen from Anchorage.  Overall, dodged a bullet - it got the job done while I house hunted with only minor hiccups.  Got stupidly lucky and managed to find a huge townhouse with some quirks under asking price.  Picked up a coworker as a roommate and he's paying half the mortgage/HOA.  In a tough market in a city that's getting pricier by the day, I've set myself up pretty darn well financially.  Shot up 2 levels in Ingress with more to come, and went to 2 anomalies in 3 months.  I'm not nearly as burnt out at work (yet...) Also...fine, I'll admit it...I decided to indulge my curiosity a little - I was able to responsibly and safely consume a certain plant product we all know and love for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  The current problem:  at the risk of getting emo on everyone, I've just been going through a personal string of crappy luck that's completely out of my control and putting me in the wrong headspace to fully enjoy it here.  It seems like every week some Mickey Mouse personal BS pops up and distracts me (I won't go into detail here.)  Between the weather and having to deal with all the life stuff, it kinda steals Denver's thunder a bit.  I think things are trying to get better, though.  I want to love it here.  tl;dr: Everything's set up to be awesome, but I keep getting distracted by crappy weather and life stuff to really let go and enjoy it as advertised."
Denver,3cqedu,snowtard,2,Fri Jul 10 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting down voted, this was a very good answer to OP's question. First off, I've lived here my whole life and I can assure you that the rain this summer is just an anomaly. Usually summers here are extremely sunny and dry but this year it has been incredible mild and wet. Good luck with your future here, I hope everything works out!"
Denver,3cqedu,Yxven,2,Fri Jul 10 06:31:40 2015 UTC,"Came here to add on to what /u/TACOUNT said. Both of my parents are natives as well, and they have never seen a summer like this one with all of the goddamn rain. I can assure you that the last 2 months are not normal."
Denver,3cqedu,throwawaypf2015,2,Fri Jul 10 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that the people who moved out here and really didn't like it moved back. I moved to Seattle last year, and I moved back within 6 months."
Denver,3cqedu,Chekkie,2,Fri Jul 10 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"I moved here almost exactly a year ago to the day. I knew 1 person here, and had no job or housing lined up.  I came from the east coast, a northeast city where I grew up and came to live in after I finished college. I left because I realized I was at the age and the point in my life where the window for making spontaneous life changes was quickly closing, and I needed to do something vastly different in my life.  I sort of moved here sort of hoping to find myself and my place. I haven't quite found it yet. It's been hard to meet people who I get along with and like hanging out with. I've had a hard time finding work beyond working shitty jobs in restaraunts.   Denver has been underwhelming to me. Culture is limited, for sure. People are overwhelmingly white (and the boring white type). It seems that lots of people who really love denver are from other midwestern states, where living truly sucks (imo). People rave about the music scene- but it's extremely commercialized with crazy inflated prices (see posts complaining about service charges at redrocks, fillmore, etc). The same touring acts and prepackaged tours stop in denver as well as the other 25 national cities on their tour. zzZZzz  The limited public transit kind of bummed me out, back east an hour commuter train would take me to awesome seaside towns, or to a different state. Denver is kind of a magnet- it's hard to leave as its sort of an oasis in the middle of nothing else.  So I'm kind of in the meh camp for denver. There are plenty of other places where life would be much, much worse for sure. Moving here hasn't really worked out for me yet."
Denver,3cqedu,LetsGetMotarded,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Oklahoma/the 1950s in September of last year, with my sister & two friends. One of us ""had a job"" here that of course fell through at the last minute, and because of that we weren't able to secure permanent housing before our move date. So two of us ended up subletting a little apt. while the other two fended for themselves. We took temp jobs and looked for rent houses non-stop.   Long, dumb story short, here we are 9mo later and both the other ""friends"" have bailed/moved back to OK, my credit score has dropped around 230pts and I'm now working f/t for close to $30k less than I made in OKC. We do have a cool new roommate and a weird little house in a nice 'hood, but it was harder than hell. That being said, I'll never move back there, ever. Denver is amazing, as long as your tires can handle Earth's Worst Paved Roads.   My advice would be to lock down AT LEAST a f/t job before you move, and if you're lucky, housing as well. Denver is exploding, and no matter what you're looking for, there's already three other people in line for it. Prepare to hustle."

Denver,3cqedu,scotland42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, the low octane difference applies to mostly older cars, but newer cars should be filled with what their owner's manual specifies.

That lasted the summer, and by the time Fall rolled around, I got a better payed job at American Furniture.

When you're going down the highway at 55-75 miles per hour, hitting a pothole like that doesn't just blow your tire, it can easily destroy your rim and even cause major damage to your vehicle.  When they were rebuilding Wadsworth they left a lot of giant potholes in the road all over. People were constantly pulled over on side roads putting on spare tires.  No news stories or anything like that. lol they didn't even put up a sign warning people of road damage. I made a post here about it asking if anyone had experienced issues with it but I was more or less told to shut the fuck up and buy a different car.  Anyway I feel bad for them. If my super limited understanding of policy is right, interstates are under the jurisdiction of State Patrol, and they don't give the slightest shit about ""road debris"" damaging your car, from my experience. If it was potholes, those poor people are probably fucked."

Thornton is also big - it stretches from I-25 @ Highway 7 to 84th Ave, and roughly follows US-85 until E-470.    The grand daddy of them all however, is Colorado Springs.  If you ever wanted a city that just keeps on going, go there.  It's 186 square miles and I swear it takes longer to get through Colorado Springs than it does to get from Denver to Colorado Springs.    The answer to your question, is annexation.  The northern and western suburbs are surrounded by unincorporated land.  Here is the process: The city decides to annex the land.  At least 50% of the landowners agree.  The city tells the county, ""hey I wanna annex this and the landowners want to be part of the city.""  The county approves and the city grows.  I've simplified it, you can find the entire legal process Here (PDF).  Westminster won't continue to grow very much as it mostly borders incorporated areas, so it has nothing to annex.  The only thing it can do is merge and I highly doubt any neighboring city will want to do that.  Cities like Thornton, Brighton, Commerce City, Aurora, Parker, Lone Tree will continue to grow in size because they border unincorporated areas."
Denver,3cqmk8,ndrew452,2,Fri Jul 10 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm familiar with annexation from when I lived in Memphis. That is a city that just purely annexes stuff for tax reasons because all the white people move out of the cities to the burbs so they annex the burbs then the white people move again once the ""urban"" people move out there."

Denver,3cojhs,chucho_0,2,Fri Jul 10 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"How is biking during the winter? I don't own a car and am looking to move to a city where I won't need to buy one. Is it Colorado feasible? I'm fairly used to heavy rain in the Northwest, but I have little experience in snow (although I've heard of people getting snow tires for their bikes). Is there a lot of ice or does it stay frozen once it freezes?  Also, looking at PadMapper it looks like single apartments are really bland and expensive, or really far out. Is there a good balance anywhere? Is most of the action near the city center or fairly distributed?  Thanks!"
Denver,3cojhs,yewdontknowjack,2,Thu Jul 9 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"I have about a 2 mile bike ride from my house to work downtown. It's very doable most days of the year. Winters can be spotty, and I'm not stupid enough to try and bike in the snow/ice. That's how you get hurt. Unless it's a couple day long storm, the ice and snow doesn't last long. For the harsher winter months, I just buy a booklet of bus passes ($20 will get me 10 tickets, or, 5 days of round trips). If it's nice, I bike. If it's crappy, I take the bus. If nice in the morning, but a chance of an afternoon storm, I take the bus.  As for apartments, if it's just going to be you then be ready to have something mediocre and expensive if you live in the city. It really comes down to whether you're willing to shell out the extra money to be close to the action. I own a car, but love the fact I hardly use it unless I'm driving to the mtns.   TL;DR Can totally bike in the winter, it's fairly mild in the city and the bus is your friend if Mother Nature is being a bitch. Apartments are a tiring subject. It's expensive to live in ""desirable"" areas."
Denver,3cojhs,chucho_0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks. 2 miles doesn't sound bad at all (right now I'm at about 6 or 7). I've gone since 2009 without owning a car and a couple years without regular access to one, so I would like to continue that lifestyle."
Denver,3cojhs,AnhydrousEtOH,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"I rode my bike all through the winter until I moved too far away to ride. Winter biking in Denver is pretty easy.   Some tips:  Dressing for biking in the cold is all about layers. You'll want a water proof and BRIGHTLY colored outer layer. Don't buy biking specific outerwear, it's overpriced and usually performs worse than non-biking oriented items. Get a good pair of winter gloves, a balaclava and water proof windbreaker and pants. Biking generates a tremendous amount of body heat so you will not need as many layers as you think. I rode in -6F weather and was too hot with a t-shirt, thermal underwear and my outer jacket. But this you will find out through experience so the easiest is to just ride a few times and adjust accordingly. You should be uncomfortably cold when you initially start out. If you're warm just standing outside you're going to be way too hot when you start riding. But the extremities need to be protected so don't skimp on gloves and get a balaclava that fits under your helmet.    You absolutely need lights for your bike. I wear a head lamp, have a strobe flash light for my front light and a strobe red LED light for my back light. The more lights the better. It gets dark early in the winter so you will likely be riding in the dark. Your goal is to make all the distracted drivers on the road see you. Most drivers will not expect people to be riding in the winter so you need to go above and beyond to make them pay attention to you.   When it gets below 10F, you need to have a backup plan. At those temperatures it is too cold to change a flat tire and below 0F I have had my freehub freeze open and render my bike useless. My backup plan was my wife but for you it could be knowing what bus routes follow your route and where those stops are. I would recommend getting gator skin tires and/or tire liners and/or puncture resistant tubes. Your goal should be to make it so you can ride over broken glass without worry. The tread of your tires doesn't make much of a difference. I like a hybrid tire with a flat center patch for easy rolling on pavement with knobs on the side which help grip when cornering or when you hit some snow.   Keep your chain clean and heavily oiled. It will rust anyways so replace the chain after every winter season. I also coated my bike's frame with a sheen of oil to keep the moisture off.    But for Denver specifically, the parks department does an excellent job keeping bike paths clear. Often times you'll find the path plowed and in better condition than the roads. The intense sun here will melt any ice or snow rather quickly. But keep an eye out for shady spots. However, any snow more than 2-3"" and it becomes extremely difficult to move so I would wait at least until the next day after any major snow fall for them to clear the paths. That said, you need to realize you will fall if the roads are anything but clear. You need to learn how to fall without hurting yourself. It should go without saying that you need a helmet. If you hit a patch of ice, do not turn, do not brake and do not pedal. Just coast over it and you'll be fine. Never use your front brake on snow or ice covered ground, use only the rear brake. You will wipe out quickly if you use the front brake.   Overall winter biking is a lot of fun. The paths are clear of people, it's pretty quiet and you often have an easier time than the cars on the road. And for Denver, most of the winter will be clear, sunny and an easy time. More often than not the paths will be completely clear and easy to ride. But always use your best judgement. If you have to commute on the roads, remember that those same distracted drivers that will buzz you in the summer now have longer stopping times and many have bald tires or no idea how to drive in the snow. You need to be extra cautious and aware of your surroundings."

This community, with a distinct Hispanic heritage, has been featured in Travel + Leisure Magazine as well as National Geographic Traveler. The 250-acre section northwest of downtown has experienced amazing growth and changes over the past few years, and is overflowing with trendy restaurants, bars, and shops. Three diverse commercial districts - Lower Highlands (LoHi), Highlands Square and Tennyson Street make Highlands Denver's largest neighborhood. Highlands Square at 32nd and Lowell is a charming neighborhood of quaint boutiques and restaurants, situated among bungalow-style houses. Here, you'll find shops offering anything from books and gifts to fine lingerie and contemporary fashions. Restaurants in Highlands Square serve up an array of fare, including Mexican and Caribbean cuisine, seafood and sushi. Pubs, as well as wine, sake and martini bars play a big part in giving this area a fun, lively ambiance. Another area of interest in Highlands is the Tennyson Street Cultural District, with a number of art galleries, where you can spend an afternoon browsing antique prints, photographs, and paintings from local artists. You'll also find a few live music venues and some great Italian and Mexican food. The Navajo Street Art District is tucked away in the Lower Highlands area of Denver. With amazing galleries, fine dining, great performance art, and ample parking, it's truly one of the best kept secrets in town. If you're looking for a neighborhood on the verge, look no further than Lower Highlands, or East Highlands. Spanning both sides of the Highland Bridge, LoHi is a great place to shop, eat, stroll and relax."

Denver,3cojhs,_glencoco,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  It looks like I'll have to buy it soon or some restrictions come up, do you know anything about that?  Labor day deadlines or whatever?"
Denver,3cojhs,BungalowDweller,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"As already suggested, the Epic local is probably the best option for unlimited days at multiple mountains. That said, it's the best fit for folks who have the flexibility to go up on weekdays and/or extended stays.   If you think weekend skiing may be more your jam and aren't sure yet how often you'll actually be able to make it up, you might want to consider the Copper 4 pack. This year, it looks like it's running $159 for 4 days. if you buy it at the Christy Sports Powder Daze event around Labor Day, you get a 5th day free. I get two of those every season, and 10 days for $300 is plenty for me.   20 days on the Epic local pass works out to about the same as 10 with 2 Copper 4-packs, so it really just depends on your level of optimism for the season.   Either way, welcome and enjoy!"

I like trying unique foods from different regions when I travel (which is rare). I'm from Northern California if that helps. Also any good places for Lumpia or sushi?  This is my ""vacation"".

Denver,3cojhs,sfdc_dude,2,Sat Jul 11 18:43:04 2015 UTC,There isn't really any dispensaries near the airport. Take a look at weed maps for locations. Give the Wana sour gummies a try.

Denver,3cojhs,Gen_Jack_Ripper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Hey /r/Denver. What is the REAL opinion on Aurora? We found new homes being built We can't seem to find nice/newer homes (that aren't 1,000 sq. ft.) for less than $300,000. Also, renting seems impossible unless you want 800 sq. ft.   So, we found new homes being built in Aurora that we really like, but don't know much about the area. It's in Green Valley Ranch, and it seems like a nice place.   Is Aurora ""that bad""? The area seemed like 30-40 year olds and had a neat beer garden. It would be close to my work and not ""terrible"" from downtown for Avs games/beer."
Denver,3cojhs,MountainGoat84,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:36 2015 UTC,"That area is fine as far as crime goes,  just know you're very close to the airport you'll have that noise. Be picky in a walk through,  they are throwing those places up fast so they make mistakes."
Denver,3cojhs,StacieDuffy,2,Sun Jul 12 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Aurora is so large that it can differ a lot depending on where you are.  SE Aurora is almost all homes built since 1990 and has a very different feel than homes up near Colfax.  Most Denver area new builds are going up in east or south Aurora or much further north near Brighton, some out NW in Applewood or west Arvada, and then little pockets where ever the builders can find some land.  Green Valley Ranch is the closest to the airport with new homes (although Copperleaf has a large new home development and isn't too much further south).  It is a little bit different feel than other areas and therefore is a bit cheaper.  If you're looking to rent a newer single family home in Aurora (typical 3/2/2), you can likely find something in the $1,500-$1900 price range.  To purchase newer homes in the same area, they really start around $230K-$250K and go up from there.  To get a feel for the neighborhood or area without being there, I strongly encourage people to Google street view and virtually ""drive"" the area.  Take note of the condition of the yards, cars, # of cars on streets vs. driveways, shopping close by, etc.  Also, I usually provide my clients with Census reports for the immediate neighborhood if they're not familiar with the area.  The data is there and free so why not use it.  Compare it to a report for an area that you have lived or know to help give a frame of reference.  Knowing the avg. household income, avg. age of resident, demographic breakdown, rentals vs. owner occupied homes, etc, can really help understand an area without being there.  (I'd be happy to pull a couple of these for you, just message me.)  Hope this helps and let me know if there is anything I can do to help."

I'm looking for a 2 day route. There'll be two of us, both in pretty good shape and able to cover ground and elevation without too much difficulty. We'll be doing this in a week or two.  Criteria, roughly in order of importance: * Killer scenery * Campsite with great views * Options to climb a peak or two (even a 14er, which would be really fun to build the trip around) if weather/time/energy permit * Nearish to Denver - if the drive is longer then the hike has to be shorter. * Decent fishing is always a bonus * A loop hike obviously makes logistics easier but we have 2 vehicles if necessary  (reposted here at suggestion of admin) Advice very greatly appreciated.

My fiancée and I will be relocating after our wedding around the 28th of September. I have secured a job near the north side of Centennial (near the Orchard Road/I-25 intersection) and she is still looking for a job. Mainly we were just looking for any advice on where to move to or how to go about finding the right place.   Right now we are really interested in living in some of the older, ""hip"" urban areas on the south side of the city.  It would be nice to have some character to the apartment as well, such as a renovated old building, hardwood floors, exposed brick, or something along those lines.   For reference, we are looking to stay around or under $1200/month and we will be bringing a cat and would like to add another, or a dog, once we got there. West Washington Park seems like a good fit, as does Capitol Hill, Congress Park, Platt Park, etc.  I would like to be able to access the light rail fairly easily since my office will be about two blocks from a station. We are really interested in being in an area where we can easily walk or drive to some cool bars/breweries, restaurants, concert venues, or other forms of entertainment.  Obviously, we want to be in a relatively safe area. I'm sure there is minor crime that takes place in all of these locations, but do any stick out as worse than the others?  I have found several property management companies in the area that have some units that are what we were kind of picturing.  These include Cornerstone, Red Peak, Wheelhouse, Boutique. Any recommendations or horror stories to share with these?  Additionally, if anyone has suggestions for areas that are right at the base of the foothills where we can quickly get out to hike, please let me know as that might be another option we would be interested in.

I call the tow company posted on the building and it turns out the tow company isn't allowed to tow until after 8pm (per Red Peak's policy).   My advice is to avoid any bigger property management company like the ones you listed. I have friends that successfully rent from the individual landlords/smaller property owners with a lot of success, but it can be pretty hard to come by. Good luck with everything!"

Denver,3cm6ms,shastert,-26,Fri Jul 10 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"It amazes that people have been so thoroughly mislead.  The new board members are doing good work. They have NOT proposed making any changes at all to the curriculum. All they have done is propose a review of the brand new curriculum being foisted on the nation by national education interests.   I ask everyone to please take a breath and think about that. Do you seriously approve of the idea of accepting and approving a curriculum developed by others without any kind of review? Isn't it the boards responsibility to study and approve new curriculum? How do you think one goes about that? What is the board doing ""wrong"" when all it is doing is it's duty? If these board members were ordinary union lackeys, the exact same statements and proposals would be accepted as being correct and natural... it's normal due diligence.  Other accusations make even less sense. The board is in no sense dragging it's feet on new school construction. Normal bureaucratic procedures for predicting needs and identifying build locations are ongoing and necessary construction will in all likelihood take place. At no time have the board members in question voiced any opposition to doing what needs to be done.  Please have a sense of perspective and intelectual honesty, people."
Denver,3cm6ms,MurphyBinkings,8,Thu Jul 9 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"With regard to the curriculum proposal, it was a political protest copied near verbatim from a Texas proposal. There were already mechanisms in place for district curriculum review. After the blowback from Williams' proposal, they dropped the APUSH language (for now). They DID, however, still vote to give themselves control over curriculum review (3-2 vote).  And the board absolutely has dragged their feet in funding new construction. They have repeatedly ignored district staff advice, and even that of their own hand-picked superintendent, to finance at least some of the construction. Instead they've allocated only 72% of the building estimate and have been going around saying they funded the building. This money has also partially been used at the expense of reserves, which can lower the district's credit rating.  On top of the poor accountability, the board has disrespected and disparaged parents, teachers, and even students (going as far as displaying a minor student's social media profile at a PUBLIC meeting and strongly implying she is racist).  Honestly, there would be far less outcry if this board had any shred of decency or respect. Almost all of the bad press is self-inflicted and served only to shine a spotlight on their far-right, ideological agenda and their steamroller approach to implement it.  Tldr: Sign the petitions to recall Witt, Williams, and Newkirk."

But once you get the chatfield or cherry creek res the views are great. Just please don't time trial it like a stravahole.
Denver,3coq22,atchon,4,Fri Jul 10 21:59:22 2015 UTC,Cherry Creek can be done entirely on either road or bike path. If it is a clear day you can get some nice views in the parking lots near the swim beaches too. Haven't done Chatfield.

Everything is paved, just pick a point.  If you are concerned about only pushing yourself so much to start, I would recommend starting either north of 225 on the Cherry Creek trail head north or any where on the platte as the elevation change is limited.  Also note that going from South metro to downtown has an elevation drop while going south has an elevation gain.  When I was trying to get my brother riding, we would start on the platte about mineral or belleview and head into Chatfield to start, then to downtown for a longer ride.  Our goal is to do the triangle of mineral to 470 east to cherry creek trail to REI downtown and back up the Platte trail to mineral.  Ride single file, call your pass and slow down in heavy pedestrian areas."

If you heard this guy was doing his 14er marathon to raise money for a specific cause or charity he would have effectively gotten you to at least think about a cause/charity that maybe you didn't know about before.

Denver,3cmi5s,whitecompass,3,Thu Jul 9 03:43:35 2015 UTC,All of mountaineering is pointless and dumb. It is about pushing yourself and doing cool things. Which is exactly what this record was.
Denver,3cmi5s,atchon,-6,Thu Jul 9 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"We have different definitions of cool.  This record is like trying to play the fastest round of golf. If that's your goal, you're missing the point entirely."
Denver,3cmi5s,whitecompass,3,Thu Jul 9 18:48:21 2015 UTC,Except alpinism is about going fast and light. This is an incredible embodiment of that. Ueli Steck arguably one of the best mountaineers in the world also focuses on speed records. To call it pointless and dumb just is ignorant of mountaineering.
Denver,3cmi5s,atchon,-4,Thu Jul 9 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"Except alpinism is about going fast and light.   Says who? It is to some people, but not everyone.  Speed records aren't about mountaineering. They're about getting attention."

""Speed records aren't about mountaineering. They're about getting attention.""  So someone who sets a goal for themselves to finish a marathon in 4 hours, or a 5k in under 25 minutes is just doing it for attention? This is about self accomplishment, not attention seeking."

""Alpinism is a style of mountaineering which focuses on ""light and fast"" climbs using few camps and limited equipment."" Look at any training book for alpinism, they all discuss going fast and light.  All of mountaineering is about pushing oneself and seeing what is possible in the mountains. Whether that be climbing harder routes, or climbing more routes in a shorter time. Obviously any of these feats can lead to attention.   You are shitting on the achievements of someone who has spent 20 years climbing 14er's. Yet from the sounds of it you have never climbed a single technical route."

I don't know how you aren't impressed by this.   Because it's a completely ambiguous record that necessarily involved way more people than just himself. It's a made up measuring stick. And it's reminiscent of the type of people who post their running distance on facebook every time they go for a run.

It's narrow, but very long and you wouldn't know it. Anyway, they did great work, and when my car started leaking coolant a few months later, they had it towed in, diagnosed, fixed (hose clamp broke), tested, and they were giving my car a bath 4 hours after I told them where it was!  Another time the radiator itself had a slow leak. Again, they had it fixed same day and gave me a rental so I could get back to work.  Neither repair cost me a dime (initial repair was covered by insurance).  If they are booked up, try Mile Hi Automotive on Lipan St. My coworker swears by them, and they we good to me when I had my car brought in for an estimate. I remember seeing someone who brought their car in because (I assume) it was making noises when driving. Turns out, some unnecessary panel was hanging from the car, dragging from the ground.

I never want to mess with someone else's life.   I agree wholeheartedly. I was fortunate to be on a criminal jury where the guy was clearly guilty. It only took us a couple of hours to come to a verdict. And most of that was us simply walking through the evidence. Even still it was terrible knowing that our decision was going to send the guy to jail.
Denver,3cp6f1,inversend,3,Fri Jul 10 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"The defense case seems weak and more about showing he was insane.  There was zero argument if he was guilty and limited cross of the prosecution psychiatrist.  Nearly all of the case will come down to was he insane at the time of the crime, and we don't know the jury so it is up in the air.  I don't necessarily agree with our DA in not accepting life in prison to build his own political career at the cost of millions to the tax payers either."
Denver,3cp6f1,vajeanius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"I agree about the cost & the questionable motive of the DA. But the insanity plea is just that.   From what I understand, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did it and that he was legally sane at the time of the act. While the defense must attack the ""without a reasonable"" doubt aspect in regards to sanity.   It's obvious the mf did it. The defense is arguing ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" rather than ""not guilty"". So there is no need to try to introduce doubt regarding anything other than sanity.   I'm not a lawyer, correct me if I'm wrong."

Denver,3cklhy,aglidden,3,Thu Jul 9 00:48:22 2015 UTC,I can not argue with those statistics.
Denver,3cklhy,uber2016,3,Thu Jul 9 04:57:53 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing.  I'd rather avoid the whole getting stabbed bit altogether.

Denver,3cjl6a,ColoradoJustice,4,Wed Jul 8 16:16:02 2015 UTC,You also get significantly less value for your money. Companies like Trelora are notorious for getting significantly undervalued transactions when representing sellers. If you think all your agent does is open doors you've got the wrong agent. They should sit you down and explain their competitive advantage over other realtors and sales models.

Denver,3cjl6a,enjo13,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:20 2015 UTC,Trelora is a shithole.  One of the founders is the biggest douche bucket you will ever meet in your life.  I've seen listings now where regular agents only offer $1500 commission to Trelora agents who contract their listing.
Denver,3cjl6a,cosmonautsix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"They should sit you down and explain their competitive advantage over other realtors and sales models.    No, you should sit me down and explain to me why a real estate agent should make 2x or 4x more money for doing the same work when they sell higher value properties to lower one's.  (AKA: It doesn't take 4x more work to sell a 2m house as it did a $500k one).  The industry is a free-for-all and has too much commissions built into it.  Just like the stock market and investment brokers, the real estate brokers will be a thing of the past.  An ""agent"" should have a set price, instead of a percentage to leech off of.  Just like all businesses that provide goods and services, a set price, instead of a percentage is the fair way to do business (and how Redfin is now going about selling properties)."

Denver,3cjl6a,user_1729,10,Wed Jul 8 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Good point, it just depends on what you're looking for out of the city.   If you like the night life, and don't mind city troubles, I think LoDo, LoHi, cap hill, and into uptown all good options for some people. Tons of restaurants, easy walking, terrible parking, lots of noise, plenty of bars, young folks, and some YoLo style rowdiness. My comment about the crap ending up there is that Lodo is LOWER so it physically washes down there and two the crowds are just not up my alley as a guy who is in bed most nights by 10. I think people who live in the individual hoods like to have some rivalry between them but it’s just living in a city. (I’m no city expert so I might have some of the actual neighborhoods a little off here)  I live in park hill, I’m a mile from 3 grocery stores, walking distance to a few restaurants and still in “Denver” (but so is green valley ranch, wtf seriously?) I can bike pretty much everywhere, park my car anywhere I want, get groceries, garden, it’s a nice blend of suburban life with easy city access. My mortgage is less than most people’s rent and I have space for toys. I work downtown and I’m at work in 15-20 minutes on my bicycle, that said, Highlands is really similar and about 15 minutes closer to the mountains (which really ads up if you head out there a lot).   I’d lump park hill, city park, clayton (if the wind is right), govs park, congress park, wash park, parts of highlands, basically all of the Denver proper suburbs into this general vibe. Mostly good neighborhoods, good access to the city, privacy, etc. There are insanely fancy parts of park hill, and scummy parts and I imagine the same goes for all the ""suburb"" type neighborhoods.  I think some of the transitional neighborhoods, like… five points, Rino, baker, whatever the one is between santa fe and I25 where stolen bikes always end up are a bit of a toss-up. The city has dumped TONS of money into Five points, and general development has made Rino a bit less industrial, baker still seems to have some good properties but it’s transitioning, who knows about santa fe, and well I don’t make it down to the DU area so someone else might have to chime in about that. Basically, if you don’t know anything about it, it’s easier just to say “I dunno I don’t go to (insert neighborhood), it (sucks, is dangerous, is lame).”   People who choose to live in the Denver city suburbs like to talk smack about the folks in the heart of the city because we think it’s just a bunch of drunk annoying rich kids paying a ton for rent and generally annoying us and we probably blame them for the traffic going up to the mountains (stereotyping here). They probably think we’re a bunch of old farts who still want to be cool by not moving to REAL suburbs (guilty), we like to go to the bars sometimes but get away from the bustle of the heart of the city. We all think the transitional neighborhood people are crazy. I’ve lived all over Denver and I genuinely love this city, it’s not a “hard” city, there’s plenty to do wherever you live, you just have to decide what’s important to you. For me, yeah Lodo kinda seems like it would suck, but for a 25 year old moving out here from SF or NYC it’s a toned down relatively affordable fun place. To that same person, living in Park Hill is boring and so far away from everything, for me it’s pretty good. Just decide what's important and make of it what you will."

Denver,3cjl6a,cosmonautsix,5,Wed Jul 8 21:13:15 2015 UTC,"Been in aurora since I was 10, mississippi and peoria.  Even now I'd move right back in that that neighborhood, its solid blue collar and never once got mugged, raped or murdered.  Are there some less desirable pockets?  Sure.  Would I want to live off east colfax in aurora north?  Not exactly, but I can name a few worse areas.  Aurora has $50k condos and $1 million dollar houses and everything inbetween.  A giant chunk of aurora is in cherry creek schools, has tons of ethnic eateries and University hospital, childrens hospital and a yet finished VA hospital.  And now light rail running all up in here. Sure, I've migrated down to SE Aurora, but its still a pretty great place."

Denver,3cjl6a,bucknuggets,17,Wed Jul 8 12:48:45 2015 UTC,"One of Aurora's biggest problems is its transportation:  it's a PITA to get in & out from.   Boulder is farther from downtown than Aurora, but there's a fast & frequent bus that goes between the two.  Plus it was designed back when people wanted to drive everywhere.   While it may have some great roads, a lot of people are sick of spending their lives in cars - would much rather get someplace and walk."
Denver,3cjl6a,SaudiAurora,8,Wed Jul 8 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"Aurora is quickly becoming a walker's paradise.  There are 97 parks, 5,000 acres of open space, 6,704 different bike trails that lead all the way up to Golden, and the paths get plowed and fixed more often than the streets.  It took 3 attempts to destroy and remake the Powerline trail (that was a loud and shitty summer), and the Cherry Creek spillway and other spots are getting some much needed maintenance.  It's definitely got shit bus lines everywhere, they never plow side streets, and the traffic is really bad right now because of the light rail construction.  Sable, Abilene and Centertech are all completely destroyed ATM, and Alameda around the Aurora mall is a disaster.  The recent completion of construction on I-225 (especially since the speed limit got upped to 65) should make travel a bit better.  If anything, the issue is with I-25 going into downtown, that stupid bottleneck on I-225/I-25, or the mousetrap at I-25 & I-70 fucking things up.  If I-25 is in bad shape, then you're out of luck unless you want to catch the light rail from 9-Mile.  It's easy to get out of Aurora, it's just not easy to get into Denver.  Maybe things will improve a bit in 2016."

Denver,3cjl6a,zOSguru,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"My biggest beef with Aurora is that they leave roads incomplete.  For example, on Tower Road north of I-70, there are a couple of sections that go from 4 to 2 back to 4 then back to 2 then back to 4 lanes for very short stretches.  They both have Aurora signs near them and show as being in Aurora on the map.  Same goes with the section of Arapahoe that is only two lanes.  Both create unnecessary bottlenecks.  Then there is the area northeast of Southlands where lanes start and end with no rhyme or reason."

Denver,3cjl6a,niemandsengel,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"Montbello is actually not that bad anymore. I grew up in GVR in the mid 90s, when it was still a haven for Denver cops and firefighters, and was always sketched out when we ventured into the Bello. Around the time I was in high school, things definitely started changing and I had no problem driving through it or stopping at the library on my way home from school.   Now I'm a happy home owner in south Aurora, and am relieved to see the ""facelift"" that much of the city has gotten. After living in Hoffman Heights in the early 90s, it's definitely much improved from my childhood memories."
Denver,3cjl6a,SaudiAurora,0,Wed Jul 8 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"GVR was a good idea, but when they were building it, you could tell that it was just going to be an extension of Montebello.  It's not shit, but it's shit adjacent.  I give Montebello grief because I'm tired of being pulled over by cops after dark just because I'm wearing a hat and look suspicious in my car.  I had to work a graveyard shift in a place off of 52nd and Havana for a few years, and if I carpooled there with my black friend, we'd be harassed on a weekly basis.

Denver,3cjl6a,MonsterBurrito,14,Wed Jul 8 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"I live near Santa Fe and Oxford. TBH I like this area more than anywhere else in the metro area. Why?:  1 - It's quiet, but it's still close enough to the light rail and major bus lines, easy to get around even if you don't have a car.  2- Housing is (or was as of 2014) still affordable. I bought my house in early '14 and got in at 230k. May not be the case now, but I'm finding a lot of recently married friends are trying to buy in our area, because housing is so unaffordable/unavailable in Denver.  3- River Point - gotta love dat Costco.  4 - Remodeling/ Denver So. Broadway rejuvenation push down. Since the Broadsterdam boom, South Broadway is starting to get cleaned up, and it's moving past Hampden down to Bellview. We have a new Sprouts. Acres is a new Tapas/Wine bar that just opened last month, and it's the shit. We have a Ramen place at Broadway and Bates ( It's Ok..). I've been here 10 years, and watched South Broadway go from having major exports of used cars, cash 4 gold, and hookers -- to weed, independent restaurants, and desirable retail.   5 - Crime. It's low. The last time I heard about anything bad going on in Englewood, it was last year when an older woman died on the jogging trail near Pirate's Cove.  6 - It's a lot of old people (and that's a good thing!). It means they have had the security to live here for years, undisturbed. It also means that when they pass on, or give their property to their kids or grandkids, more young people and businesses will show up. They already are, which is why Englewood is renovating all of it's public schools. (That, and the influx of revenue from the tax on Marijuana sales).   I don't need to live downtown and listen to bros puking outside my window at 3 AM, or in Highlands where I pay for the privilege of living next to over-rated boutiques, and my neighbors gluten-free, free range poodle taking a dump on my front stoop.   /rant.

Copper Pot does a good job. Their skillet scrambles are excellent.  Maddie's (not technically Englewood but close) on Downing near Harvard Gulch has some of the best Banana Walnut scratch hotcakes you will ever have in your life. Get there early because it is literally a tiny garage converted into a diner.   The Breakfast Queen is the classic ""greasy spoon"" diner of Englewood with great hash browns. They just remodeled too, so its much bigger/cleaner. Staff is good.  Shoutout to El Tepehuan - not breakfast food but damn good mexican. They moved out of the building they were in near Bonnie Brae Hobby Shop --closed due to rent. They are going to reopen on the corner of Broadway and old Hampden where that Pho place used to be (don't worry, it sucked anyway. Go to Pho 007 in Littleton)."

There were roaming bands of kids all over the place. Inside the Walmart I saw some kids steal Apple Cider saying that would fuck them up. I guess they thought it had alcohol? When I was checking out I saw some kids buying like 20 5 hour energy drinks thinking they'd get messed up on that.    Another one was we were trying to go to one of the bigger bars with some Canadian friends one night and the bouncer wouldn't let the Canucks in because he said their Canadian IDs weren't real IDs.  Another time we were at this other bar where some cover band was playing. Lots of 40 - 60 year old drunk Aurora people. Decided to leave because I was tired of listening to hair metal and watching nasty old ladies make out with fat old dudes. Went outside and the cops were everywhere. Someone had been stabbed at the bus stop.  One time I was at the Piper Inn. Place always looked intimidating driving by but everyone there was pretty drunk and having a good time when I was there. They had great food too.  I used to spend most of my time in Aurora at night so when I think of that town I'm reminded of weird experiences like that.

Denver,3cklmm,mufasa12,6,Wed Jul 8 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"This is a common problem with all online sale events.  some people report not seeing any tickets available seconds after opening. some people report tickets available many minutes later...  there are small intricacies with how the event is timed on your own computer and timed on the server computer, and how they distribute tickets, that cause many problems. When these events occur, you click ""buy now"" or something similar, it reserves tickets for you until you complete the order, if you cancel, it releases those tickets back into the queue, which could explain them coming available minutes later."

Denver,3ckmw4,Tomes14,27,Wed Jul 8 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you like it! Recognize though that 16th St Mall is a tourist destination and hardly representative of the city or the state! I work for RTD as a bus driver and I'd like recommend several destinations to you that shouldn't be too difficult to get to on public transit.   Golden: Golden, CO is the old territorial capitol of Colorado. Nestled between where the Rocky Mountains explode from the ground and two flat-top mesas its about an hour ride on the route 16L from the State Capitol. Golden is beautiful as it sits right under Lookout Mountain, it has an old west ambiance, and there are lots of cool little stores, restaurants, and boutiques there. The river walk is really cool too as its the Clear Creek stream that comes rushing out of the mountains and into the Coors factory down the way. Oh, and the factory! You can tour the facility and its tasting room for free. South Broadway: South of the State Capitol on Broadway is a cool little part of town. From about 6th avenue south to Alameda (about 9 blocks total) is a seriously cool bar district with themed joints, upscale dive bars, and shops of all sorts. Its a hip mid-20s to mid-30s sort of area, I obviously love it. The Route 0 will get you there from downtown. Cherry Creek and Cherry Creek North: South and East of Downtown, Cherry Creek is our version of Santa Monica. There's a big mall there and just north of that is a shopping district with high-end shops and boutiques, bars, restaurants, and hangouts. You can get here on the Route 1 but I'd recommend the the 83L or the 79L as they'll get you there just a little quicker.   Bus fare on RTD buses is $2.25 per adult, $1.10 per child under 19 and persons over the age of 65. Military, police, and firefighters ride for free with proper ID or uniform. With a cash fare you can claim a transfer to another bus good for the better part of three hours. There are day passes and multiple day passes available for purchase at RTD stations downtown (Civic Center Station on the North end of 16th St Mall by the Capitol  and at Union Station at the south end of the Mall)."
Denver,3ckmw4,Fofolito,5,Wed Jul 8 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"And OP, if you do visit Golden, also check out GCB (or any local brewery, really, but GCB is one of the closer ones to Coors- about a five-minute walk away). It's basically a beer garden in the brewer's backyard and you get some quality Colorado beer, not just Coors ;)  Edit to add: Also, Clear Creek isn't the actual water that goes into Coors. There's an aquifer under the brewery that supplies the water."
Denver,3ckmw4,NineteenthJester,2,Thu Jul 9 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Cannonball Creek is also a must. North of Coors and GCB by a few miles-- walkable if you're determined.

There are some really terrible buildings in Denver, but this is essentially picking on simple infill buildings that are mostly just fine.   The Beauvallon: I actually kind of like it and it's fantastic at street level. Although it's a bold statement (and apparently built terribly), and I can understand the criticism.  Residence Inn Denver City Center: Huh? It's an all brick building. It fits into that corner beautifully. It doesn't make an architectural statement, sure, but does every building need to?  Hilton Garden Inn: Same as above, although I'm not a big fan of the EIFS.   One Lincoln Park: Sod off.  Embassy Suites: The ""blind shaft"" on the side is because the next thing built will butt directly up against the building. That's zero lot-line territory (the new hotel on 14th/glenarm has the same issue). Although I do agree, they used relatively cheap materials on the upper part of the building which is a dissapointment.  Solera: I really like the building. Quality construction and generally nice materials. I enjoy walking past it and find a lot of interesting details.  Everything else: Uninspired apartment buildings. Ya none of these are particularly interesting, but mostly are ""just fine"". With the exception of AMLI Riverfront, the lack of retail in that building is so damn baffling. It's in Denvers most important new neighborhood and across the street from Downtowns first grocery store. Couldn't even find space for a dry cleaners? I hate that building not because of architecture, but because of function."

Guy shows up saying they have fiber and I was already thinking of switching so I signed up that night.  However, I got no calls to get it set up the next week as I was supposed to.  Then when I called them, the agent said I don't have fiber in my area and I should cancel my order.  I was ticked so I chatted with another agent online and they said they did have fiber in my area but if I wanted to get the 1gb, there was a data cap on the plan.  I called back and talked with someone else and they were finally able to confirm I could get the fiber with a residential plan and it would be around $120/mo (with the phone) with no data cap.  This is a lower rate as there was a promotion going on and it is supposed to increase later.    My impression from my experience is it's so new that they didn't have all their systems together and not everyone is trained on it.  My area was the first set up apparently.  The technicians took several hours over a couple of days to set it up and had to call in a higher level technician because they weren't sure how to do the install.    End result - I would still move to fiber, no question.  The line is direct to my house so no network sharing with the neighborhood, no lagging between 5pm and 10pm, I rarely have to cycle the network, and the speed is just fantastic."

No bills for three months, then shutoff notices (we couldn't get online and check because they said the phone number they forced on us wasn't the right number for the account). Sudden spikes in the bill followed by sudden dips. Outages were rarer than Comcast is now, but Comcast comes back up within 10 minutes usually. Centurylink would go down for entire days, their tech support couldn't even give me a reason and they never agreed when I asked them to comp us for an entire day of missing service.   Shit, one time they wanted me to pay to ship the entire modem (with all the accessories, packing, etc) across the country, with no loaner, because they couldn't replace the power cord. They didn't offer any relief in the bill for the week of lost service, and they refused to just send me a new power cord. I ended up just buying my own, as by then I was pretty sure they'd send me back a ham sandwich if I sent them the modem.   I don't know anything about their fiber service, but I wouldn't take gigabit internet if i had to deal with them for it."
Denver,3ci9j0,netmier,2,Wed Jul 8 05:18:52 2015 UTC,Do you think they'll ever get better? Does their support suck because Qwest sucked and it's just all the same people? I have a hard time understanding how they are still in business.
Denver,3ci9j0,DarthBarney,0,Wed Jul 8 05:31:08 2015 UTC,"No.  Actually customer service under Qwest was better than it is under Century Link.  However, it's 1000x's better that Comcast IMO, and they don't throttle..."
Denver,3ci9j0,SaudiAurora,-1,Wed Jul 8 06:19:20 2015 UTC,The hell they don't.  I dealt with CenturyLink throttling the fuck out of me for a number of years.  56k dial-up would have been better.
Denver,3ci9j0,hubertron,2,Wed Jul 8 15:52:06 2015 UTC,Is it throttling or backhaul congestion? 5-10pm when I was on DSL was horrendous in CapHill.
Denver,3ci9j0,SaudiAurora,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Backhaul congestion most of the time in Aurora (especially when people get off of work and get their Netflix fix), which is why they're constantly replacing and upgrading things in the surrounding area.  Sometimes it will lead to a two-day outage, which is a pain in the ass to deal with when you are working from home.  I can only imagine how bad it gets in Cap Hill and other places downtown.  CL will flat out refuse to credit your account for those outage days either, and even if they say that they will, it's not worth fighting with billing and customer service for half of the day in order to correct things.  Throttling was common for me at first, but once I upgraded to a business account and really stayed on their asses about making sure I was getting the speeds I was paying for, then the throttling stopped for the most part."

I tried to find a valid data source from your link. or kind of way they conducted the survey. your direct link says ""customer service rank"", but it links a source and that source says this ^ quoted above. which is not just customer service but ""customer satisfaction"". this quoted data gathers many things beyond service. like law practices, which i would agree comcast is a bastard regarding lobbying and law manipulation.  also, i commented that the phone service is garbage while the in person retail sites are just like any other store, simple fast and good service. So i can agree with much hate for the company, but also want to point out much of the hate can also be attributed with how YOU choose to interact with them. you wouldnt call up walmart head quarters asking what the price of some toy at your local store is. but many people treat comcast phone service that way.  maybe i've just gotten lucky. maybe i know how to navigate a 'high' tech service company. maybe I imagine that comcast is good because my experience and product with them has been better than the other 2 i have tried (charter & century link), like comparing shit to pee."

Any company that induces you to contract with them by offering X terms and then changing those terms after you've entered the agreement is a croc of shit.   Century link basically ""sold"" me services at a lower price than I've ever gotten from them. There was of course no recourse for me to prove they fucked me or to get out from under the agreement for the initial term.   Now supposedly I'm not under contract with them for a specific term, but am still able to get service. I'm sure that's bullshit as well and if I attempt to fire them they will tell me I'm obliged to keep paying them for another year or buy out.   Fuck century link, and I've had com cast in 3 states. Idk why  people are so quick to diminish other companies fuckups because comcast also sucks."

She had to go through these trouble shooting steps (like a powerpoint) and only after could she send a texh out. Most of the time it was someone in the boonies (far from the node) with bad service. Nothing she could do there except take the brunt of the heat from customers. Shit job. If you have the customer service by up plan you get better support from what she said.  We cut the cord and just use cell phone tethering with PDAnet and an unlimited data plan. I get 25Mbps down and 1.5Mbps up with my Sprint phone. That costs $20/mo for unlimited data on top of my $35 framily plan."
Denver,3ci9j0,CaptainHindsite,3,Wed Jul 8 13:55:45 2015 UTC,I had my 1Gb connection installed for a few months now. I have not had to deal with customer service but the two guys who came to install it were very nice and knew what they were doing. They installed a box about 1 ft. sq. on the side of the house that the fiber runs to. Inside this box is a splitter that has 2 ethernet connections and a standard phone line connection. They connected my house phone line to this box and ran a new cat 5e Ethernet connection to a Gb router (that they provided) in my office. They also installed a battery backup to the outside box so I don't lose phone service if I lose power. I'm paying ~$130/month for 1Gb fiber and a phone line and I'm not using their tv service.  I have not had any connection issues since getting it installed. When I had DSL my connection would degrade over time and I would have to reset everything once every couple of days. My Comcast connection would drop randomly once or twice a week. The fiber connection just works.  I find the actual performance to be less then stellar. If you are just watching movies it's great but I need to move multi-TB files around for work. We developed special software that will fill the data pipe to take advantage of faster connections. At the office we have a commercial class 100 Mb connection and I can consistently get 80 Mb/sec upload and download speeds. With the 1 Gb connection I can get 400 Mb/sec download (limited by where I'm downloading from--not my connection) but I can only upload at 30 Mb/sec. So it does not appear to be symmetric as they advertise.

I didn't feel the need to rent a prism box and pay for it to sit there collecting dust.   BTW One box has to be directly connected to the modem, then you can rent a wireless box for other TVs.  Its probably legal because its a promotion bundle. Ya know, where they bundle the services no one wants (landline phone, really?) with the service that we really want (1000mbs)."

You will never get good speeds, your service will drop for days, you'll constantly have techs installing new wiring, your bills will get mangled and impossible to contest (even if you could speak with someone, it will take a minimum of 4 - 5 attempts to reach them), and the amount of modems that they allow for self-installation is absolutely pathetic.  Even my landline would drop off for a few days every month.  Stay away from bundled deals, and save every shred of paperwork you receive from them.  Record calls on Skype whenever possible.

Denver,3cgyvw,eta_carinae_311,2,Tue Jul 7 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's ""wrecked""... once they get the fuel cleaned up the road will be fine. Thanks for linking the photo, interesting to see"
Denver,3cgyvw,Plokijwa,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"This might be dumb, but I drove through it while the spill was happening. Didn't know what it was until my car started smelling like fuel. That didn't seem good, so I got a carwash . Is there anything else to be concerned about or I should do to clean my car? First fuel spill..."
Denver,3cgyvw,ndrew452,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:43 2015 UTC,You're probably ok but make sure you clean the undercarriage well if you didn't do that yet.
Denver,3cgyvw,eta_carinae_311,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"It's just diesel, the smell will linger but you will be fine."
Denver,3cgyvw,comet3popeye,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"The carwash should have cleaned most of it off, anything else remaining will vaporize off fairly quickly. It's just fuel, same as if you were filling a mower or something and spilled a bit. If your car had been doused in it, I suppose you might be concerned about the paint but I don't see a reason for you to worry after just driving through it :)"

Denver,3cfhwx,Beeroncos,4,Tue Jul 7 21:00:22 2015 UTC,I just guessed - we might be able to tell after pupation tho.
Denver,3cfhwx,Cranberry_Lips,9,Tue Jul 7 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I was able to help. I hope your caterpillars enjoyed them. I've eaten better looking nettles myself, so I wasn't sure if they were going to be good enough."

Denver,3cfhwx,daydreams356,10,Tue Jul 7 16:26:55 2015 UTC,WOW. Three questions: 1) why are you going to bother her when she pupates? 1a) are you going to interrupt the process? 2) is there a systemic parasite problem with butterflies in Colorado right now?
Denver,3cfhwx,daydreams356,15,Tue Jul 7 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"After she pupates she'll be in a nice leathery case and won't worry about being turned around so I can get a well-lit picture. I have no intention of interrupting the process.  Yes, there is a deep systemic parasitoid ""problem"" in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Last fall I collected 20 moth pupae in Jefferson County, and 100% were infected with wasps. I used to work in a butterfly garden in Costa Rica, and our star attraction was the blue morpho. Different species of wasps attacked the eggs, the caterpillars, and the pupae - deadly for the butterflies and a real pain in the neck for the entomologist.  The value in studying parasitoids is in identifying which wasp attacks which butterfly or moth. Butterflies and moths cause tens of billions of dollars in crop damage so getting badass enemies that lay eggs inside pests' bodies is a great alternative to heavy-duty pesticides."
Denver,3cfhwx,knittingbee,8,Tue Jul 7 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like bringing in wasps to kill off butterflies is a bad deal. With our honey-bee issue in the United States, we need all the pollinators we can get. Sure, moths are awful around here. Since moving to this location I've never seen so many damn moths in my life. It wasn't hard to keep them out of my garden, though. It seems like we'd be targeting butterflies too with the parasitic wasps. I recognize their value in dropped beetle and fly numbers, though.  Anyway, love the post! Interested in the outcome!"
Denver,3cfhwx,brijjen,10,Tue Jul 7 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"You make some good points and I'll try to explain a little better. The idea in this case is not to bring in wasps, it's to see which wasps associate with which targets. They can be really specific (only attacking one or two species) or they can be generalists (attacking many species.)   Caterpillars are little eating machines - imagine doubling your weight ten times a month eating leaves - so they can strip crops down to zero pretty quickly, or make them so nasty that even the most organic hippies will disregard them. It's one of the most basic aspects of food cultivation that insects will interfere at one time or another, and so is finding ways to control the pests. The chemical warfare we've been relying on for generations is not sustainable in the least, so looking to more biotic controls like wasps and mushrooms is a very hot topic everywhere food is grown commercially.   Back to my caterpillar, let's say Wasp X crawls out. I go down to Boulder to the CU bug collection and figure out what it is. Then I check the literature to see if Wasp X is already associated with my caterpillar species. It's probably already recorded, but if not, hey, now it will be.   Then, just maybe, a caterpillar similar to mine starts getting onto some Colorado crop besides nettle. Now, entomologists have my record to look at and see, Wasp X is the badass who can control this pest with no chemicals.   As for pollinators, the native bees and syrphid flies in CO are more than enough to make up for honeybee decline."

Listen here RonPaul2012.....  in the real world, back on good ole Planet Earth, marriage is a contract and is specifically governments business via laws and courts to uphold and enforce that contract.  Back in the real world, what with sociology and biology and all, it it typical still for one party in that contract to give up future educational and employment opportunities in order to raise the children.  Meaning that when the contract gets broken then someone has to take care of the kids and the party who decided to give up employment references and prospects because ... get this... many times there is like anger and retribution and normal human emotional stuff that makes the two parties not amenable to agreeing by themselves.

Denver,3cgcs0,enjo13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"Marriage should just be none of the government's business. Legally binding contacts should be good enough for everything else, and those shouldn't matter what you are, so long as you are capable of consent and of age!   This is the ""lets just call marriage something else argument"" I think?  Which is really nonsense, and it leads to the same equal protection issues we had before.  Marriage is an important institution. It grants a LOT more than tax benefits. It's how we've decided to handle things like determining who gets to make medical decisions on a spouses behalf. Who has default claim to death benefits. Default co-ownership on a whole host of things... marriage is essentially a shortcut in which we can point at someone and say ""that's the one I want to heap extra access to my life on and I want everyone to honor that"".   The other version of this is, interestingly, exactly what gay folks have been doing for decades. You try to anticipate every eventuality and sign a mountain of contracts giving your partner the ability to handle it. Although when your hospital nurse isn't a lawyer, it can be difficult for them to decipher that power of attorney and grant you the access you think you should have. Untangling all of those contracts if you decide to part ways is equally problematic (and incredibly expensive).   Marriage isn't trite and it's certainly not unimportant. It seems like exactly the type of thing a government should involve themselves in. That same government should also strive to implement it in a fair and equal fashion, which is precisely where the United States finally found itself in 2015."

Denver,3cidr9,mahogey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:13:10 2015 UTC,Because it is still illegal to smoke anything in 99.9% of business establishments. See Colorado's Clean Indoor Air Act. I doubt that place is still open because most other ones throughout the state have gotten shut down promptly.
Denver,3cidr9,digital_evolution,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:00:16 2015 UTC,It was open 2 weeks ago.   Vaping and dabing though.   And can't you still smoke cigars in a cigar bar?

IIRC some people are trying to change vaping/e-cigs to be illegal as well under the act, but overall I think we can agree that the law could use revisiting.   I'm not saying everywhere has to change, but it'd be nice to see a cannabis club exception just like cigars have.  As someone who stopped drinking, I love the ability to legally use cannabis. Would love to be in a place to meet people of the same mind."

Denver,3cd847,Gigathulu,8,Tue Jul 7 20:01:17 2015 UTC,I've always been curious about this because I enjoy drinking as early as 6 and continue socializing/drinking with friends well into closing time.  Why do you like to start so late?

I enjoy having some time to unwind before I go to bed before dawn and after doing sidework. Denver isn't a big city, let's be real. Most businesses wouldn't have any reason to stay open that late anyway, especially on weeknights outside of the mall. LODO will always be full of drunk idiots who will be idiots no matter what time they are kicked out of a bar, and although it sounds a bit callous, I'm happy we have a designated space for said idiots. Maybe allow certain places to be clubs that stay open until 4 like Shotgun Willies? My 2 cents."

I understand that this would not force bars to stay open until four, but goddamn I just don't give a shit about the technicalities. This is the stuff my nightmares are made of. We bartenders may close at two, but it isn't common for us to be working until four as is. This would mean bartenders and staff would work until six in the morning, rendering it impossible to hold most other jobs or attend school, as many of us do. Even while I believe the bars that would take advantage of this are likely places like Beta, Lodos, Punch Bowl, etc (or places I'd rather avoid), the people who work there deserve to have lives outside their bars. It is already an isolating position; let's not worsen that.   Side note: Before we could do this, I propose we raise the server wage, and have reliable 24/7 public transportation."

If you don't want to work that late, find another job.   Edit: If you think most bars would stay open until 4am on anything but friday and saturday nights, that wouldn't happen.

Bartenders (an extreme minority of the population) wanting to get home early shouldn't control how late everyone in the rest of society can stay out late.  There are certainly people who will take those hours if they are available. If you don't want to work those hours, someone else will definitely step in and take that job over for you.   Next you'll be telling me about how baristas would like to sleep in every morning instead of waking up at 4am, and the rest of society should stop wanting coffee at 5am."

The reason most bars have ""bar time"" is usually because when things get busy it's difficult to get all of the drinks out of others' hands at 1:58. Think about bars that have patios, multiple rooms, etc ... Doing it earlier is one of the only ways to be sure to avoid a violation.

Denver,3ccorl,QuickSpore,31,Mon Jul 6 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"Contractors?  If what I've read prior to this, almost all of the cost overruns can be put directly at the feet of the VA. They chose a bid & build process that they had little experience with. They then didn't follow that process, instead they used a mongrel mishmash of traditional and IDC processes. And then they ignored the contractors' advice on how this would explode the costs.  The VA had a project where the architects, the budget planners, and the builders had very little contact, and a process that assumed they were going to be in constant contact. The designers designed a building that was vastly more expensive than the budget called for, and that has had thousands of design changes inserted. The construction crews have been building a building where the specs keep changing, during construction. And the budget planners have been making numbers up, because they didn't have an actual completed design to work from.  But as far as I can tell this is simple incompetence and mismanagement on the part of the VA, not malfeasance on the part of any contractors."
Denver,3ccorl,Tangurena,11,Mon Jul 6 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"In software development, the constant changing of specs is usually mocked with ""can you move the couch a little to the left? No, I think the couch would look better on the right. A couple more inches to the right."" Except with building construction, we're talking walls and elevator shafts that get ripped out and rebuilt.   I used to work at Kiewit. They know how to do stuff and get it done on time, on spec and within budget. This project is a poster child for ""move the couch"" spec changing."
Denver,3ccorl,GringodelRio,4,Tue Jul 7 05:03:09 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking that. Kiewit and the other contractors, arch firms, etc. are all big players who get shit done routinely.

Bullets came raining down into our campsite and were ricocheting off all the rocks around us. Luckily we had a rock wall between us and the shooters. It's just unfathomable to me that people think it's ok to just shoot without a backdrop/target. Crazy.
Denver,3cddm1,HRHill,4,Tue Jul 7 03:21:04 2015 UTC,Yes.
Denver,3cddm1,rocsk1,3,Tue Jul 7 14:27:00 2015 UTC,We were yelling (and our dog was yodel-screaming) but they couldn't hear us over their shooting noises. I think anything that could make a lot of noise would help.
Denver,3cddm1,TK44,5,Tue Jul 7 14:51:08 2015 UTC,I usually carry when I'm up in the mountains camping- when this happens to us at our camp site I will find a nice big safe berm and fire a few rounds off in between our neighbors shots so they know someone is in that direction. It's actually ended our neighbors shooting sessions pretty frequently.
Denver,3cddm1,AhabFXseas,6,Tue Jul 7 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes people think they're shooting with an appropriate backdrop, but aren't.  Lower-velocity (handgun) rounds won't always stick in the ground and can sometimes bounce pretty high after hitting the ground, so if people are shooting into gently-sloping ground with a backdrop close behind, it would be possible for rounds to bounce over the backdrop and land on whoever / whatever was beyond.    People need to be really picky about where they shoot and have high standards for what constitutes an appropriate backdrop.  Maybe someone with more knowledge / experience can chime in."
Denver,3cddm1,riomx,9,Tue Jul 7 17:53:37 2015 UTC,Holy shit. This is one of my worst fears. We were at Guanella Pass a couple of years ago and there was some moron firing a shotgun close to our campsite. We couldn't see which direction he was shooting from and I'm damn sure he couldn't see us either. I don't think people should be allowed to shoot anywhere near campsites.
Denver,3cddm1,Jackalopecia,12,Tue Jul 7 18:01:11 2015 UTC,They're not allowed to.
Denver,3cddm1,riomx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"Each time we've camped at Guanella it's been the norm. Never saw any rangers nearby, though. I think most people probably just do what they want."

Denver,3cddm1,GringodelRio,9,Tue Jul 7 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"""It is not believed to be an intentional act at this time, however, that has not been ruled out,"" the Douglas County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.  Bullshit. The discharge of a firearm is an intentional act. If someone is firing not at a target in an appropriately back-stopped location with proper safety precautions, I'd say they intended on whatever happens next. Anyone who has spent any time around guns should know better, should know the safety rules, and should know you do not fire unless you know what you're firing at. Hell, you don't even load your weapon unless you're ready to fire. Once bullets are in the gun, you're responsible for whatever happens because you're intent is either to kill something, or destroy something.  Bad gun owners piss me off to no end. Following the very basic rules means no one gets hurt. And they really are stupid simple rules."
Denver,3cddm1,reddeth,4,Tue Jul 7 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"Same thing with ""accidental discharge"". There's no such thing. A discharge that was not intended to happen is a negligent discharge, because the only way for an (unintentional) discharge to happen is through negligence."
Denver,3cddm1,GringodelRio,3,Tue Jul 7 13:34:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The word ""accident"" and guns should never be in the same sentence.  There are no accidents with firearms, only negligence."
Denver,3cddm1,COScout,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"There are no accidents with firearms, only negligence.   This is a pretty simplistic view of the world. Sure, following proper safety guidelines can help reduce accidents with firearms, but humans can't predict everything and sometimes accidents will happen. It's pretty unreasonable to lock someone up because their own bullet ricocheted and injured themselves. The fact is, sometimes unpredictable accidents happen with firearms."
Denver,3cddm1,GringodelRio,2,Tue Jul 7 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"I never said we should lock people up. But yes, if you're using your firearm properly it should do exactly what you are wanting it to do. If you're aiming at your target, ricochet should not be an issue, especially if you're taking into account what is behind the target when considering whether it is safe to fire.  Basically, my point is, whether it's criminal negligence or simple negligence, it's not an accident.  Or, if you want to be very hyper specific, accidents are possible, but exceptionally rare. Damn near every ""accident"" can be attributed to negligence. An accident in my book is doing everything right and still ending up upside down, e.g. the gun misfiring and blowing up in someone's face. Not putting the gun in my holster and firing it into my leg."
Denver,3cddm1,COScout,2,Tue Jul 7 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is I hear people make the ""it's always negligence"" argument, but to me that just isn't accurate. It's possible that someone can go find a nice backstop of soft earth to fire into, only to hit a rock buried a half inch down and have your bullet ricochet. To me, that's an accident not negligence. I won't argue that anyone who shoots themselves was likely being careless, but I think that saying it's always due to someone's negligence let's people tell themselves that they'll always be fine because they handle firearms responsibly.   The problem with this in my mind is that it allows people to become comfortable and complacent with firearms, which only increases the chance of something happening, negligent or accidental. People should always remember that a firearm is specifically designed as a deadly weapon and nothing else. One must be hyper aware of it whenever they are handling it, regardless of whether the safety is on, it's unloaded, holstered, etc."

I don't know if they do it every year, but you have to pay to load a sponsored Visa in order to buy food/drinks, no cash. I get tokens/tickets at festivals like this, but I pulled out my personal Visa to load money onto a different Visa just to buy stuff.  Edit: It could be a blast if you have a strong Irish heritage. I don't, but did appreciate all the music and vendors. Also, parking is a nightmare. 6/10."

My goal is to suggest hikes that are appropriate for the season. Knowledgeable local hikers are welcome to join in the conversation. And of course, questions are also welcome.  July is the time to head into the beautiful Indian Peaks wilderness, south of Rocky Mountain National Park and less crowded.  This hike leaves from the popular Fourth of July trailhead, north of Eldora. Good idea to get there early, especially on a weekend, as parking is limited.  The hike, around 5 miles round trip, will take you through lush, flower filled meadows past rushing creeks and waterfalls to an alpine lake, perfect to sit by and eat your lunch before heading down.

Denver,3c76g3,IamMatthewOk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:06:02 2015 UTC,the impression i get when reading about Zipcar is that they most be returned to their home location while car2go is any of their parking locations.  is that correct?  the only strike i can find against car2go so far is that they lack parking/pickup at the airport.
Denver,3c76g3,stillbrasko,2,Sun Jul 5 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Car2Go cars can be parked at any metered spot downtown (for free) or any non-restricted street parking.  Also, the parking spot needs to be available for 24 hours (i.e. pay attention to street sweeping rules when you park).  Look up the map to see where the service area is.  If you take it out of the service area, I think the charges are different.  That said, Car2Go can be expensive if you're not sure where you're going or if there's an event going on downtown and there's no parking available.  You'll drive around searching for a parking spot for 20 minutes racking up $0.40 every minute (or however much they charge now).  I think my average trip when I was feeling super lazy/hungover to go 10 blocks to work was about $5 or so if I could find a parking spot.  Uber is cheaper."

Denver,3c76g3,_denver_,0,Mon Jul 6 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"It's short sighted only if you don't have access to a burner smartphone, and a stolen license. Not sure how Car2Go payments work, but if they'll accept a prepaid credit card (or, they had access to a stolen card) then they can keep all their info at arms length.  Compare that to the traditional way this would go down. The shooters would steal some cars, do the hit, then dump their vehicles. That would require them knowing how to hotwire a modern vehicle and use it in the short, indeterminate window of time before the car gets reported stolen and the plate number gets red flagged on police license plate scanners. In other words, the standard way of doing this requires a more specialized skillset and has far more variables than the Car2Go one, which just requires identity theft 101 and basic burner phone tradecraft.  Provided the shooters thought this through (and they aren't in custody yet, so apparently they did) this plan may be more brilliant than boneheaded."

Denver,3c9fp0,bluntrollin,3,Mon Jul 6 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"and Black bears are big fat pussies.   Not to nitpick but this is only sometimes true. It is rare but black bears have killed in Colorado before, like at RMNP and elsewhere, and there have been numerous non-fatal attacks around Aspen in recent years. 20 years ago one smashed into a young guy's trailer and ate him. Males can grow over 500 lbs and the state record is over 700 lbs, so they are no joke. You are right that they generally fright easily but not always and people should still be very cautious around them."
Denver,3c9fp0,emeryor,5,Tue Jul 7 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"Mauled by what? Colorado isn't exactly teaming with predators looking to eat humans.   Just make sure to make noise while hiking, preferably hike with a partner and if you're still worried carry a sidearm.   I'd be more worried about getting lost.

Denver,3c89hc,gogogadgetkat,3,Mon Jul 6 09:15:28 2015 UTC,"I foster for a rescue and have been fostering for almost 15 years. I take old and sick dogs so I've had to put a lot of them down. It breaks my heart every time.   Here's what I've learned:  Get 5% lidocane cream from the pharmacy (it's behind the counter, so you don't need an Rx but you do have to ask for it. Also, never use the rest on your fingers, toes, penis or nose. Dangerous).  Trim the hair from their forearms with electric clippers, which is where they usually put the needle. The vet is going to do this anyway. You might call the vet to see where they're going to put the needle but forearms have been a safe bet for the breed I work with.   Smear lidocane cream over their forepaws (or the area the vet told you to use) and wrap in plastic wrap for 20 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap and smear another layer of cream on. Rewrap for another 10 minutes. Time this so the vet arrives now.    By the time the 30 minutes have passed the needle site is totally numb and they don't feel the needle, which is the most painful part of euthansia and why the vets usually take the in the back, so owners don't have to see that part of it.  A heartbreaking moment is made just a bit easier if they don't have the pain of the neeedle. No one wants to watch their animal hurt more when they're trying to relieve pain!"

No honey, I get paid for giving up 24 hours of my time at a stretch to be there for you.  It took 2 years of college ed just for my paramedic.  I was shot at, assaulted, spit on, puked on, had brains all over me, and have seen things that 20 years later I cannot unsee.  I scrubbed garage floors, scrubbed out the units, and the bunker room every workday. For all of this I made $6.22/hr.  I was not paid to sleep.  I was paid to gain the education and experience to be there when someone else needed me.  Fuck people like the OP, and that video going around of the old guy griping out firefighters for buying groceries.  Get out of your comfy armchair and put your money where your mouth is, since you know so much about RESOURCES, PopeSeanV.  Go get the training and education, pass the physical agility tests, get state/national certified, and take on that huge responsibility of a first responder and then post back here and tell me where you spotted the ""wasted resources.""  Tell me all about knowing every call has the potential for danger, and has the possibility of huge responsibilities. Miss half of your kids' school events.  Work most holidays for years on end.  Stay up all night with no sleep and then try to find the ""white house on an unknown side street"" where someone may or may not be in cardiac arrest.    What, you think you deserve a whole army of highly qualified people to sit around for free ready to clock in only in case you personally need them?  Not how it works, fucknut.  Do you tell a cashier to clock out for every minute they aren't ringing up customers?  A white collar worker to write their company a check for every second they spend looking at their personal phone, or having a personal thought?  No?  Maybe you should start there, PopeSeanV."

Denver,3c5rhf,NineteenthJester,4,Sun Jul 5 07:30:37 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Anyone who can lose a child at an event like that and not report it shouldn't be taking care of a child. I also agree with you that this child may not be typically developing for whatever reason. She really looks older than 2-3 yrs to me but the police could have come up with that estimation based on how well she was able to communicate.

Denver,3c5rhf,spongebue,8,Sun Jul 5 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Regardless, it's a useful piece of information when someone claims to be a family friend or anyone useful in the investigation.  If the news reports her name as Jane Doe, anyone can go to the police and say ""Yes, I know Jane!  I will take her home with me.  Her parents are out of town, I don't know who was supposed to babysit her""  On the other hand, if the name is withheld, someone can call police (who would know her name) and ask if that's Jane Doe.  That would give a LOT more credibility to anyone claiming to know her.  And actually, that brings up another thought.  Maybe a preteen or someone was supposed to babysit the girl, lost her, and got too scared to call the police.  Stupid, yes, but judgement and thinking long-term is not always the best at that age."

Denver,3c6ghf,jadeoracle,6,Mon Jul 6 13:01:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry I've got plans today. But I was planning on heading to the museum next Sunday as their new exhibit ""The Power of Poison"" opens this Friday.  I'm 29 Female, I love museums & Travel. Let me know if you'd want to meet at the museum next Sunday the 12th. I'll be there either way, likely earlier in the day to be able to find parking.   Also Pro-Tip from a museum member, make sure to check out the days when its a ""free day"" at the museum or Zoo. Those days are insane and impossible to find parking."
Denver,3c6ghf,jadeoracle,5,Sun Jul 5 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Next Sunday sounds great. I think going earlier makes good sense. I forgot about the new exhibit that's coming, I haven't heard anything about it lately, but was quite intrigued the first time I heard about it.   I didn't know the Museum did free days, I thought it was only a Zoo thing. I'll definitely watch for that. Thanks for pointing that out!"
Denver,3c6ghf,jadeoracle,3,Sun Jul 5 18:19:16 2015 UTC,Yeah the next museum free day is July 26th I think. DAM also does free days as well. All on different schedules
Denver,3c6ghf,epidemic,2,Sun Jul 5 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"Neat! It's cool that these places have an opportunity for people to get in free, especially for those who can't afford it otherwise. I feel everyone deserves the chance to experience the culture and education museums and zoos offer. I heard that the New York Metropolitan Museum is always free, but they have a list of suggested donations for entry."

Denver,3c5qtq,JesusHMontgomery,2,Sun Jul 5 01:55:46 2015 UTC,It's wheatpaste.  There are a few local artists who do this sort of thing from time to time.  Where on Alameda are you seeing them?
Denver,3c5qtq,SaudiAurora,2,Mon Jul 6 14:55:24 2015 UTC,I'm between federal and Sheridan. I think I've counted 8. I like seeing them because it makes that part of Denver feel less like a cesspit.  EDIT: this exact one is in the alley behind the ARC on Hooker and Alameda.
Denver,3c5qtq,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Wheatpaste:       Wheat paste (also known as flour paste, or simply paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from wheat flour or starch and water. It has been used since antiquity for various arts and crafts such as book binding, découpage, collage, papier-mâché, and adhering paper posters and notices to walls. Closely resembling wallpaper paste, a crude wheat flour paste can be made by mixing roughly equal portions of flour and water and heating until the mixture thickens.  A critical difference among wheat pastes is the division between those made from flour and those made from starch. Vegetable flours contain both gluten and starch. Over time the gluten in a flour paste cross-links, making it very difficult to release the adhesive. Using only starch, a fine quality, fully reversible paste can be produced. The latter is the standard adhesive for paper conservation.  Besides wheat, other vegetables also are processed into flours and starches from which pastes can be made: characteristics (e.g. strength, reversibility) vary with the plant species, manufacturer's processing, and recipe of the end-user.

He's another great songwriter.   I live in Parker, and I'd be down to jam, but I don't get out of Parker that often.  I play some basic guitar and some basic bass and some fun as hell drums.  I also play Irish tin whistle, Jew's harp, and harmonica.

Denver,3c43cc,Udub,14,Sat Jul 4 16:09:03 2015 UTC,You probably should check out an urgent care center nearest you. Also check with your insurance company
Denver,3c43cc,BlackDaria,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:14:55 2015 UTC,We had already been to an urgent care center and were hoping for something less expensive as our insurance isn't great. Went to see a NP in a grocery store pharmacy. Worked great! Thanks for your advice.

Denver,3c43cc,Poison_Help,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:09:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Depending on your child's age I would not trust a typical urgent care. Children's is the way to go.
Denver,3c43cc,BookBungler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:34:23 2015 UTC,We had already been to an urgent care clinic and were hoping for a simple follow up where someone could just look in her ear and see if it was still messed up. Went to a NP at a grocery store pharmacy and everything was a-okay. Thanks for your advice.
Denver,3c43cc,NotATerribleIdea,7,Wed Jul 8 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"You could try one of the king supers that have a little clinic, and some Walgreen's have a similar thing, but given its a holiday weekend BlackDaria's suggestion of an urgent care center is probably your best bet. Especially if you have to see an actual PhD. Every time I've been to one of those clinics they were staffed by nurse practitioners."
Denver,3c43cc,AtomicJesusCO,7,Sat Jul 4 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"I second the Little Clinic option in King Soopers grocery stores. They're not in every store, but are usually staffed by NPs most days.  Urgent care is also an option, but is always more expensive. An ER is an option, too... But is really pricey."

Denver,3c4vth,PawLoRado,8,Sat Jul 4 20:29:38 2015 UTC,You can always tell where the ones in Down Town Denver are going to be because they will drop a porta-potty in the median a few days before. It is like clockwork. If on Thursday a porta-potty shows up at the Speer I-25 flyover invariably a DUI checkpoint will be set up on Friday or Saturday. Same thing with Park Ave and 20th.
Denver,3c4vth,amoffamoose,-5,Sun Jul 5 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"Better to not post their locations so they can serve their purpose of getting drunk driving (attempted murders, as far as I'm concerned) assholes off the streets."
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,18,Sat Jul 4 23:24:33 2015 UTC,Some people like to avoid them simply because they cause traffic.
Denver,3c4vth,hotoatmeal,5,Sun Jul 5 04:37:18 2015 UTC,Better to not post their locations so they can serve their purpose of violating the 4th amendment.  Edit: and here's why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WMn_zHCVo
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-5,Sun Jul 5 00:51:11 2015 UTC,"The fourth amendment provides protection against unlawful searches and seizures. It does not provide protection against cops while driving drunk.  I've been through dozens of checkpoints (I'm from NM, after all!). Neither my vehicle nor I have ever been searched. I say hello. Cop asks if I've been drinking. I say no. Cop says ""have a nice evening."" No rights violated there! Note also that I'm a dude with long hair who wears rock and metal band concert shirts most days. Everyone (often cops) always assumes I'm into drugs and parties. A little respect to the police officer (whose job is likely way scarier than yours) goes a very long way."
Denver,3c4vth,hotoatmeal,-3,Sun Jul 5 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I know the Supreme Court doesn't agree with me, but checkpoints are an unreasonable search. My freedom should trump your sense of security every time... otherwise we are at best in a nanny state, at worst on our way to a police state."
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-5,Sun Jul 5 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"If freedoms trumped security every time, there would be no police or military at all. Think about things before you get all Murca about your rights trumping everyone else's.   And if the Supreme Court says DUI checkpoints are constitutional, then you have nothing to stand on except your own ignorance when you claim your rights have been violated."
Denver,3c4vth,hotoatmeal,-13,Sun Jul 5 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think there should be police or military, and I'm not all ""'Murica"" about the constitution. The constitution is useful only insofar as it limits the government.  Edit: think about things before you make assumptions."
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-5,Sun Jul 5 04:16:12 2015 UTC,Okay. Wow. You're not actually that stupid are you?
Denver,3c4vth,hotoatmeal,-1,Sun Jul 5 04:29:54 2015 UTC,Calling me stupid is not a productive debate.
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-4,Sun Jul 5 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Please don't drink and drive tonight. Seeing as you're clearly home trying to be an Internet tough guy, you're unlikely to drink or drive anyway. I call that a win for everyone. Good on you, tough guy! ;-)  Good night. I'm done wasting time with you."
Denver,3c4vth,hotoatmeal,-3,Sun Jul 5 04:43:37 2015 UTC,"Nowhere did I advocate drinking and driving, nor did I suggest that I'd do so myself. I'm legitimately interested in discussing these things, but it seems you'd rather call me names and dismiss me as 'stupid'... who is being the ""internet tough guy"" again?"
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-9,Sun Jul 5 04:54:11 2015 UTC,Wow. Got downvoted for having a bad opinion of drunk drivers. Way to go /r/denver! Now hand me my keys and a beer. That's apparently what all the cool kids are doing these days. /sigh. I hope the cops arrest every one of you who drive drunk this weekend.
Denver,3c4vth,ndrew452,15,Sun Jul 5 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Or maybe people are downvoting your support of the DUI checkpoints?  I agree that drunk drivers are a terrible danger, but I also firmly believe that DUI checkpoints are a violation of my rights.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed and that's why we have them.    DUI checkpoints have you proving your innocence, and it shouldn't be that way.  I feel they are similar to red light/speeding cameras.  Guilty until proven innocent.  At least there is a growing movement to ban the cameras."
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-12,Sun Jul 5 02:16:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Supreme Court sees it my way, not yours."

Denver,3c4vth,AhabFXseas,3,Sun Jul 5 01:50:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather drive drunk than read any more of your whiny posts.
Denver,3c4vth,deafAsianAnal3sum,-5,Sun Jul 5 02:06:49 2015 UTC,I'm a shitty person for a joke? Maybe it's the both of you that should check yourselves. It's a pointless internet website and you both come off as self-righteous.
Denver,3c4vth,dalahorse76,-6,Sun Jul 5 04:39:20 2015 UTC,How about I check myself with my friends and family members who have been killed by drunk drivers. Your joke was in bad taste.

Denver,3c4vth,LukeInDenver,24,Sun Jul 5 04:24:24 2015 UTC,checkpoints are pretty lame. I'm all for making them as public as possible.

Denver,3c4vth,ohyeahbonertime,11,Sat Jul 4 22:45:36 2015 UTC,".05 is a joke, and a clear revenue grab."
Denver,3c4vth,WestonP,8,Sat Jul 4 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's still 0.08 BAC for a full DUI, but 0.05 is DWAI (less serious, but still serious). In the more distant past, it was 0.10 for a DUI.  If you take a look at the people actually causing serious wrecks due to drinking, or even the ones who get busted because they were swerving all over the road... They're typically quite far over all of those limits, and in the 0.15-0.20 range. Another common trait is that they are often repeat offenders. Lower legal limits for BAC don't help either of those huge problems; it just gets more regular people caught up in the system because it's an easy cash grab. That said, we all know this and do have it within our power to avoid being in that situation."

Denver,3bylm9,spongebue,62,Fri Jul 3 05:38:01 2015 UTC,Too bad you'll never achieve those speeds from parker to i25. Am I right?
Denver,3bylm9,MotionDrive,44,Fri Jul 3 06:21:02 2015 UTC,Too bad no one can merge and everyone thinks 50mph in the left lane is appropriate.
Denver,3bylm9,cooldito,6,Fri Jul 3 06:48:47 2015 UTC,"I think a big thing that would help this out is if Colorado took a queue from East coast states and institute a ban on all trucks in the left lane on every highway that is 3 lanes or greater.  Only places with left lane exits would be exempt.    It would be quite simple - they already have this policy on I-70 going into/from the mountains.  Extend it to the front range.    Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't solve the problem, but trucks in the left lane generally drive slower than slow left lane drivers."
Denver,3bylm9,ndrew452,6,Fri Jul 3 15:01:13 2015 UTC,I rarely ever see truckers in the left lane. It's private vehicles doing this.
Denver,3bylm9,ridger5,3,Fri Jul 3 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"On 25, I always do.  Fairly common on 70 until the mountains as well."
Denver,3bylm9,ndrew452,3,Fri Jul 3 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"It's so infuriating when you're in the left lane and a truck jumps in front of you (going 10-15 mph slower) in order to pass the truck in front of it at 1-2mph faster.  It really messes with the flow of traffic.  Banning trucks from the left lane on 3+ lane highways would definitely do a lot.  It wouldn't get rid of all of the left lane cruisers, but it would definitely help out a lot on 25.  The other thing that would be better is if we get rid of left lane exits entirely.  They really mess with the flow of traffic -- slower traffic shouldn't be in the left lane, it should be in the right lane.  Traffic exiting is going to be slower that through traffic, and it would do a lot to not completely mess up with the flow."
Denver,3bylm9,they_have_bagels,2,Tue Jul 7 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I'm convinced that half of the congestion on I-25 South between 120th and I-76 is caused by the left lane exit to get to I-270.  Truckers like to get over to the left lane several miles ahead of the exit, so added congestion is caused by lane changing and the slower trucks.  I can't really fault them in that instance, it is just a poor design.    There is a similar issue where I-76 begins at I-70, but it isn't as bad as the I-270 exit."
Denver,3bylm9,ndrew452,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:52:49 2015 UTC,The other states I've lived in trucks MUST keep right. It's so annoying that they plop in the middle lane and fuck everything up. The middle lane is not for 'cruising' people.
Denver,3bylm9,cooldito,3,Fri Jul 3 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"Cruising is exactly what the center lane is for. The right is for slow traffic and people getting on or off the highway. The left lane is for passing. The center lane is for ""cruising."" When I think of cruising though, it's the speed limit or above."
Denver,3bylm9,alt213,0,Fri Jul 3 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Nah cruising in the center lane in any other state will get you ran the fuck off the road. The right lane is for going the speed limit or below. People getting on and off the freeway can still do this, it's called merging. Oh wait, people here can't do that."
Denver,3bylm9,cooldito,2,Sat Jul 4 04:07:53 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have trucks in the middle so that merging onto the freeway doesn't carry such an enormous risk to life and limb. They can't get over to accommodate on-ramp traffic, especially in places where there's a lot of on-ramps, so the middle lane seems like a good compromise."
Denver,3bylm9,O_Cressida,2,Fri Jul 3 23:16:55 2015 UTC,This right here is the issue. There's nothing dangerous about merging if you know how to fucking drive. Everyone here is deathly afraid of merging for some reason though and has no idea how to zipper merge.
Denver,3bylm9,cooldito,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like zipper merging and semis don't mix that well. I don't have a problem merging on with regular traffic but I do notice a lot of people seem to hate letting others in, speeding up and driving obstructively instead."
Denver,3bylm9,O_Cressida,14,Sat Jul 4 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"I am struck by the amount of left lane cruisers in this state.  Been here for two years, just had my mother out from SC, and she commented on it too as we were driving around.  They have those ""keep right"" signs everywhere and no one seems to notice.  I actually saw a cop turn on his lights and escort a cruiser over to the right lane about two weeks ago."
Denver,3bylm9,MadeForBF3Discussion,5,Fri Jul 3 13:03:58 2015 UTC,"In the state as a whole it's not much of an issue, and generally seems to be understood to my experience. In the Denver metro you don't see many of those signs because traffic is thick enough for them to be completely unrealistic and useless.  Also while Denver is a 'keep right' state that isn't a universal thing throughout the country. Check this list of state laws throughout the US. In most states the left lane isn't considered somewhere you shouldn't drive... that would be a waste of a lane. Slower traffic is just supposed to move right to not block faster vehicles in the left lane. However in almost all states this only qualifies up to the speed limit, so it's almost never an actual issue since almost everyone is doing 10-20 over here unless traffic comes to a stop."
Denver,3bylm9,ZshadeZ,3,Fri Jul 3 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"It's a good point that everyone is already going over. It still feels like common courtesy to move over if someone wants to go faster. It's safer to get them off your bumper, too."
Denver,3bylm9,MadeForBF3Discussion,-2,Fri Jul 3 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is kind to get over to let someone by, but there's nothing wrong with 'left lane cruising'. I'm generally moving faster than the rest of traffic so I stick to the left lane through the metro unless someone wants to blow past, then I let them and thank them for attracting the attention of any cops coming up before I do."
Denver,3bylm9,ZshadeZ,3,Fri Jul 3 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"I am struck by the amount of left lane cruisers in this state.   Once you get used to it, it's not that bad. Whenever there's 20 cars in the left lane all thinking they're going fast, it means the right lanes are less populated and easy to navigate through. I like to think that everyone is just queuing up to take a left hand turn... but then realize that this behavior happens on interstates and city roads alike.  It's very rewarding passing +20 cars all riding the left hand lane. Idiots."
Denver,3bylm9,Ghostalker474,8,Fri Jul 3 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've done that many times. Still feels weird passing on the right, and then there's the person that actually obeys the law, or the trucker who is doing the right thing, and I'm stuck."
Denver,3bylm9,MadeForBF3Discussion,2,Fri Jul 3 17:17:45 2015 UTC,This is not true at all.  All y'all just stay over there in the left lane.  It's better over there.  Right lane bad/mess you up!
Denver,3bylm9,mission_opossumable,2,Fri Jul 3 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"I drove to LA via I-70 and I-15 last summer, then back via US-40 to Albuquerque and up I-25 back home. Didn't hit a single left lane cruiser after leaving the state, until the 12 mile marker near Trinidad. It was infuriating."

Anyway, on 225 everyone around me was consistently going a little over 70.  So even if I'm still speeding to keep up with traffic, I'm a little less paranoid!"

Denver,3bylm9,ndrew452,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:38:26 2015 UTC,"That's what is great about the speed limit increase.  With the old limit being 55, you could have been pulled over doing 75-80 and getting hit with a big ticket even though you were going with the flow of traffic.  Now, the chances of you getting pulled over for going 75-80 are minimal."
Denver,3bylm9,Ghostalker474,4,Fri Jul 3 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"The overall speed on 225 is either 85, or 10. If someone is doing between 30 and 65, they're getting passed on every possible side (even the shoulder)."

Denver,3c134x,HandicapperGeneral,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  You get badges for performing certain activities in game.  One of these is known as the Trekker badge which you get for covering a lot of ground.  The catch is that they have put a speed limit of 6km/hr ( I believe), so biking would likely put you over that limit and your progress towards that badge would not be counted.  Other than that, yeah...it's a blast to play and I've discovered a ton of cool little things to see since I started playing."

Denver,3by440,MelkorBelegurth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:18:23 2015 UTC,It's link flair that lets people know that link was posted by someone who works for the source of the link. The flair is attached to the link and not the account. So you will only see it when it is appropriate.
Denver,3by440,triplejdude,3,Tue Jul 14 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I wouldn't mind if media outlets were given a label/tag. Individual users? I think the mods could use discretion on that one.

Mainstream media are often seen as nuisances on Reddit in general, so I can see why some posts would be seen as self promotion and spam.   But speaking for myself, I see r/Denver as a place to learn about what's happening in our awesome city.    Users are smart enough to control the nuisance posts with simple down votes.   Just my thoughts....  (Edit: missing words for grammar.)"

It gives 9news unfair competitive advantage over the news stations that respect our guidelines. They should be marked as ""propagandist""."
Denver,3by440,iamacontrarian,4,Fri Jul 3 14:55:01 2015 UTC,No. There are only so many sources for local news stories. There are sources I don't like. But they should be allowed I think.

Denver,3by440,RebelDiesel,4,Fri Jul 3 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"If the posts are not helpful for the Denver community of Reddit, they can and should be down voted. I assume most people that habitually use the same source just have a preferred source of local news, as most people do. The beauty of Reddit is the community's ability to then discuss that post and even cross check the source."
Denver,3by440,AhabFXseas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:54:06 2015 UTC,"well, i can definitely see that there might be interns or employees whose job it is to get stuff noticed on social media, and if they're blanketing /r/Denver in posts, that can get to be a lot of detritus on the new page and also a lot of extra work for our unpaid mods.  I mean, If I want to read the paper or watch 9 News, I'll go to their website.    An additional problem: news employees with multiple reddit accounts (or organizations with multiple redditors (or people with programming know-how and bots)) can upvote said articles so that they're always hot, always on the front page.  Interesting that the user name on the top post of this thread is ""SomeRandomGuySays.""  Hey!  Are you really some random guy?  or is that the alternate account of one of the folks working for one of the news organizations?  I guess I support the idea of limiting posts by users who post primarily from one source.  I don't know how you can eliminate the problem, but I believe in a reddit by the redditors and for the redditors, not by the news organization (aka corporation), for the news organization (aka corporation).

I use Reddit, and specifically /r/Denver, as a news aggregator. It's how I find stories from multiple sources about things I'm interested in and how I keep up with current events. I'm not exactly interested in filtering through half a dozen or more news sites looking for the same information these users are contributing. I think the subreddit does a pretty good job downvoting the content it doesn't want to see and if the accounts ever get out of control it's not like mods can't step in at a later date.

S**** called me back about 30 minutes later and stated he did not do anything the video showed. He stated Y**** was following them and harassing them on every stop. I asked S**** why he stopped if he was scared of Y**** and he stated he was just trying to relax on his vacation. S**** stated numerous times that he did not drink alcohol and that he had a good driving record. I told him about the video and emailed it to him. S**** stated Y**** could have easily edited the video. I asked S**** his thoughts on why Y**** would do that and why he would take his own time to go to court. I explained to him that Y**** was very upset at what he did and that the video was edited to shorten the time. I told S**** the video showing his driving actions was evident a crime did occur and that I believed the video was not edited during these times. S**** still denied the allegations and continued to say his driving record was great and that he did not drink alcohol. I explained that I would mail him a uniform summons to appear in court on this matter and would send it to his address on his driver's license (DL).

It's harrowing as a driver, and completely unnecessary.  As I said, I bike it myself and know the rush of zipping downhill and thinking you're going as fast as the cars and belong in the middle of the lane with them, but you're probably not and you don't.

If they can't pass immediately, acknowledge the car behind you with a hand signal that means ""hold on a second,"" you know, the one-finger-in-the-air thing that receptionists do when they are on their headsets.  Take the turn or what you need to do to get to a clear space, then a big sweeping ""go! go! go!"" gesture with your left arm while getting way over on the right, while braking to minimize the car's passing time.  Judging by the enthusiastic waves I get, drivers seem to really like that behavior, and it lets me set them up to pass me when I'm most capable of handing it.    I'm a top 5% descender by speed, so the issue isn't cars running up on me as it is the car underestimating how much time it's going to take to actually pass me.

Denver,3bvkm9,sian92,3,Thu Jul 2 20:13:44 2015 UTC,As a driver I get terrified of Squaw Pass because I've had enough near misses from cyclists riding the double yellow while passing each other around a bend. Driving over the double yellow in a car on that road is beyond stupid.
Denver,3bvkm9,veeholantee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"I make a point of only going up there after around 6 or 7, any earlier and there's too many bicyclists. I like to go for ""spirited"" drives, but if you're ever going fast enough to go over the double lines, you're going WAY too fast."
Denver,3bvkm9,nofxsnap,4,Thu Jul 2 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sending that in.  Having lived up in Echo Hills for the better part of 12 years I know the fun of that road for sure.  I also know some of the menaces that drive up it.  Impatient drivers, gapers, regardless of what state or where transplanted from need to follow the rules of the road.  It is dangerous.  Some of the problems come from the disparity between the bicyclists and the drivers.  I have seen many a cyclist get pasted on that road.  Including one from a drunk psychopath in Echo Hills he kept on going.  I called the cops and turned him in while waiting for an ambulance to come.  He is still in jail I think.  Please be safe.  No view or jackass driver is worth dying over.  Use the pull outs if one of the fine residents is riding your ass.  They do."

I can't say I've been unlucky enough to have witnessed crap like in the video yet, but all of the cars I've come up behind have been very courteous with pullouts. There's simply no reason to make an illegal pass like that. I'm never behind anyone longer than 2-3 minutes before they pull off and let me around.   Granted, I try to be courteous too and not ride anyone's ass like that too. I'm sure that buys me a few nice points."

I want to setup a hunters camera on this one exit ramp in my city. I'm convinced that 1 or 2 people have been littering there for years. But I'm not sure that's legal.   I worked on an adopt a highway project where I was cleaning a roadside and the trash that I found was 2 distinct ages. It was either super old or from the last year. Funny enough the girl tossed her paycheck stub it the window and I found it and turned it in with the local police for them to have a chat with her about her habits."

Denver,3bvkm9,WestonP,2,Thu Jul 2 18:50:58 2015 UTC,I used to live on this road. At least once a week we'd have a Flight for Life helicopter fly over our house to medevac someone who was driving recklessly and injured themselves or someone else.
Denver,3bvkm9,sian92,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Amazing. I was almost hit by a gray Nissan (Altima, pretty sure) on the same road about two years ago, while I was on my motorcycle. Wish I had my camera going at that time.  It was a foggy day with limited visibility in many spots, and the triple-bypass bike ride was going on. The bicyclists were coming towards me, so to pass them people would cross the double-yellow, which makes my blood boil on its own. To make things worse the dark gray car didn't have headlights on, and passed in a section where you couldn't see more than 100' in front - how on earth does someone think it's safe to cross the yellow line, let alone double yellow, in conditions like that? Never before or since have I wanted to turn around and give someone an earful so much.  Glad your friend wasn't hurt and got it on video. Can't believe they are pressing charges, but thrilled to hear it!"

The number of bikers that ride that road every day has to be in the hundreds this time of year.  It's a miracle he didn't flatten one.  Also with the number of deer and elk around this time of year, particularly on that road, that he didn't hit something else alive."

Denver,3bvkm9,epidemic,7,Thu Jul 2 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Lumping ca drivers into one bucket is dumb because we have so many different kinds of driving environments. Rural drivers, la drivers, sf drivers, sd drivers, suburb drivers, and small city drivers. Plus on top of that you have the same issues as elsewhere: new drivers, old drivers, Sunday drivers, and people who have a license, but normally use public transit.  I think the worst drivers come from SD, they are fond of speeding, passing in medians/shoulders, cutting you off, and just generally avoid using turn signals for any reason."
Denver,3bvkm9,SourCreamWater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"it shouldn't matter where a driver is from or how old they are. there are enough people on the road, and it's a dangerous enough task, that it doesn't make sense that, for most people, the only driving test they ever take is when they first get their license. lots of people would flunk a driving test just because they've developed such shitty driving habits."

Denver,3bvkm9,-SnowmanMafia-,-2,Thu Jul 2 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'll give you an example of how bad drivers are in California. I'm driving down 99 through Fresno, I'm going 30 over, because that's what traffic forces me to do. I find an opening to pass the one Ms. Pokey, but unfortunately I'm not able to complete the pass before cars come up behind me. So I merge back over, and one car passes, two cars pass.  Third car?  CHP officer. Going over 100 with other traffic. The officer in the passenger seat gives me the finger before they speed off together.  At that very moment, I realized... I'm fucking avoiding driving in California ever again if I can help it."
Denver,3bvkm9,IMA_grinder,4,Fri Jul 3 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"Moral of the story: Speed up, or GTFO of the left lane. You could find the same situation on I-25 near Denver.  Colorado, California, and many of the states in between, are pretty permissive of speeding (compared to others further East), and have always been, as far as I can recall. Unless you're in a small town, or encounter a cop who's bored or thinks you have something else illegal going on, you have to be going well over the limit to get pulled over. And even then it's typically just a fine and some small number of points that aren't going to matter unless you're dumb enough to keep getting caught a bunch of times within a year or two. They just want your money; pay the speeding tax and be on your way."
Denver,3bvkm9,IMA_grinder,0,Fri Jul 3 14:04:52 2015 UTC,"First, you may have missed the part where I did exactly that. Merged back over once it was safe to do so. Jesus, people like to trot out the ""speed up or GTFO"" line all the time. Just as it's not my place to try to enforce the speed limit in the left lane, people can also chill while someone safely merges back after passing. If you want to fly down the highway at speeds significantly in excess of the posted speed limit, you are doing so knowing full well other traffic around is going to be and is expecting you to go in the ball park of the posted limit: you're the oddball.  Also, don't speed in Washington state, the WSP will tag your ass. They may give you a warning as long as you're not a prick, but they will pull you over. Cali was the only place I've ever been through where the police get pissed off you're not hauling balls. Every other state I've been through in the West, they'll give you some wiggle room but 30 over? Disco lights will come on and they'll have a chat with you."
Denver,3bvkm9,IMA_grinder,0,Thu Jul 2 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"better yet, since you don't feel comfortable doing the right thing in the left lane, just stay over in the right lane. don't try to pass anybody. the time you might save doing so is vastly outweighed by the time you cost everyone else when you – nervous and full of trepidation – venture into the passing lane.  or, you could go take a defensive driving class and learn how to drive right."
Denver,3bvkm9,rickycodie,2,Thu Jul 2 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"How the fuck was I not ""doing the right thing""? I was actively overtaking another vehicle, and other vehicles came up very fast behind me.  I've taken defensive driving classes, probably a few more than you have since it's been required for me to take them every few years for some of the volunteer work I've done until recently."

Gay marriage had more than fifty percent support for quite some time before Obama could stop pretending he was against it. For conservatives, MJ legalization pits the social conservative senior citizen wing of their party against the younger, more libertarian crowd, who are less likely to vote in a primary.  Eventually MJ will be legal across the land. Support will have to say high (huh-huh, huh-huh) but I don't see that changing. The money supporting legalization is going to have to outspend the groups funding the other side (ie. private prisons, police unions, rehab clinics etc.) But with the fight for gay rights close to wrapped up, stoners are going to be the new homos."

Denver,3bwyuf,BungalowDweller,6,Thu Jul 2 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"u/TuggMahog nailed it, though something else to keep in mind is that this is a significantly less humid environment than what you're used to, and the dry air makes the cold much less harsh.   Whereas South Floridians are probably pulling out their parkas if it gets below 50 because of the humidity, I guarantee that you'll see folks here in short sleeves when it's 45, and still without a jacket at 35. Sure, it's still cold if you're standing out in it for a while, but assuming we don't get a crazy cold snap early, you might be surprised how not-unpleasant (is that a word?) cold weather can be in Colorado.  Edit: I should have added, that with the dry air comes the need to stock up on lotion and lip balm, and probably a humidifier for your bedroom. The 3 best investments you can make for the winter."

Sure, you'll get wind with a particularly nasty snowstorm/blizzard, or the occasional cold and windy day, but that's pretty rare.   Many times, the wind we do get in the winter is what's called a Chinook wind, which is a wind that comes west to east from the mountains and actually warms things up.

Denver,3bwyuf,TuggMahog,5,Mon Jul 6 21:28:51 2015 UTC,Hey! Welcome in advance. The winters here can be mild or wild. We really don't know what to expect any given year. We have had a lot of precipitation this year so I'm hedging on wild. Colorado truly has four seasons. So in September fall will hit with cooler temps and sometimes it will get to 30-40 degrees at night. Snow typically first falls in mid to late October but can hold off till December. Winter isn't all that bad in Colorado though because it usually doesn't last long. The sun will be out right after the snow.

Denver,3bwyuf,epidemic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:12:59 2015 UTC,Have you ever driven in snow?
Denver,3bwyuf,MeltBanana,2,Fri Jul 3 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"I moved here from central Florida, and imo the cold here is much more tolerable. Colorado is dry, meaning when it's 15 here it feels about as cold as the 30's in Florida. The weather is wildly unpredictable but cold temps/snow can be expected someone around the end of September and last until may. Buy good clothes and maybe some snow tires and you'll be alright."
Denver,3bwyuf,EmAreDubs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, doesn't a lower humidity level usually make any given air temperature feel colder, not warmer? For example, 75 degrees with 60% relative humidity feels much warmer than 75 degrees with 25% relative humidity. And in the winter, when my apartment is 70 degrees with 15% relative humidity, it feels very cold. Whereas on a humid spring day when my apartment is 70 degrees with 60% relative humidity, it feels warm enough for me to wear a t-shirt"
Denver,3bwyuf,MeltBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"More moisture in the air = the more you feel the temperature. Imagine complete humidity...as in totally submerged in water. A hot tub feels like it's burning your skin when you first get in, even though it's only 102 or so. And if you've ever jumped into 65 or lower water, you know that it feels like fucking ice.   In my experience of living in both Florida and Colorado, with high humidity the change from warm to cold starts to happen somewhere around 70. 75 with humidity feels hot and stuffy, 65 with humidity feels chilly. There are tons of factors that go into what the temperature feels like, but generally the more humid it is the more you feel the temp."
Denver,3bwyuf,sadcatman,2,Wed Jul 8 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"We're moving up there at the end of the month, and are going there to apartment hunt next week. We have some top contenders based solely on web research, but would love some advice. Does anybody have experience with any of these complexes, and whether they are great, terrible, loud, etc:   Westend  2828 Zuni 2785 Speer AMLI Riverfront Park Elan Union Station Broadstone Blake St One City Block Block 32 at RiNo IMT Alameda Station Washington Park Station   We're trying to keep a very short commute to the Union Station area, where I'll be working. We also have a 7 month old baby, and hope to avoid party pads. (Also, any other apartment suggestions are greatly appreciated!)"
Denver,3bwyuf,flyflyfreebird,2,Fri Jul 3 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"My friends and I are currently staying in the AMLI riverfront on vacation and my only qualm is the it is SO loud. I haven't slept through the night once since being here. If you look on a map you'll see its right by a rail yard and the highway - between the two of those, you won't be getting much restful sleep."
Denver,3bwyuf,loungecat,2,Mon Jul 6 22:24:47 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to say I also live in AMLI Riverfront and yea it can be loud especially if you are on a side facing the highway/traintracks.  However, when the windows are closed I barely hear a thing. To me it's a faint white noise like any living near any busy street in the city."
Denver,3bwyuf,flyflyfreebird,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:58:24 2015 UTC,We must have had an especially bad spot in the complex because I live in Manhattan and found my apt back home to be much quieter comparatively.
Denver,3bwyuf,depechegirl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"I don't live there yet but was in town searching for places last week.  Looked at IMT, seemed to be ok and it is right by the Alameda rail station.  The Broadstone Blake is right across from Coors field (actually rented an apt via HomeAway during our stay).  It's walking distance to a lot of stuff, the building  is new and has great amenities.  Coors Field is across the street and they block off Blake St during the home games so the  traffic was a bit much. Look at places in the back of the building, Blake St gets loud at night on the weekends and we had a fair amount of noise from people walking from the bars in Lodo (a little too bro for my taste).  Good luck on the search!"
Denver,3bwyuf,sadcatman,2,Fri Jul 3 07:00:39 2015 UTC,"Great, it sounds like Broadstone is definitely off our list. Having a baby in an area like that doesn't sound like much fun."

Location isn't incredibly convenient but with a bike you can get into downtown in less than 10 minutes. -AMLI Riverfront Park: AMLI doesn't allow dogs over 80 pounds so this one was off our list but the location looked nice and the building appeared to be in good shape -Elan Union Station: Good location for what you are looking for but there is a lot of construction going on all around Union Station so be prepared for noise -Block 32 at RiNo: This is actually where we stayed when we were in town.  It has large apartments with plenty of windows and updated appliances.  The downside was that it was not super close to much and didn't seem to really be in the RiNo district as much as on the outskirts.   Hope that helps some and happy apartment hunting"

My question is about apartment hunting.  We're looking for a 2 bedroom that allows animals. We're willing to live anywhere within 30-40 minutes of Golden. Our budget is a bit restrictive until I find something - maybe $1000-$1350 range. Aside from the difficulties of getting a renter to even talk to us from afar, I'm finding that most places that seem good and are within our price range have horrible reviews - 1 or 1.5 star ratings out of 5. Have you lived in a place you've loved? Do you know of any apartment openings?   Thanks in advance!

I really want to go out to an event (preferably a concert) this Friday, but I don't know enough about the local music scene to know about where who is playing what.  I got to see FIF at Casselman's a couple years ago, but that's the full extent of my exposure to anything Denver music-related.  I've checked out /r/denvermusic and this post, and other than a Voodoo Glow Skulls concert in Colorado Springs that I don't think I can get out to, I haven't really seen anything that has interested me.  National bands are pretty much out for me tomorrow (I'm sure Umphrey's will be amazing at Red Rocks but man, I got dragged out to see them once and it was not my thing).  Are there any local ska or punk bands playing at any bars tomorrow night?  Is there somewhere I can look for shows?  I barely have my nose in the DC scene so I have no idea where to start for Denver.  Either way, I'd love to see what your city has to offer.  Thank you!"
Denver,3bwyuf,DeviatedNorm,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:08 2015 UTC,For bigger acts check out Sodajerk Presents and maybe the Larimer Lounge and Lost Lake Lounge.

Denver,3bwyuf,Assorted-Jellybeans,2,Sat Jul 4 15:17:14 2015 UTC,What type of stuff do you want to see. I don't want to suggest a bunch of stuff if its not even an interest of yours. Are you really outdoorsy? Do you want museums? Do you drink beer? Will you have a car to get around?
Denver,3bwyuf,PUGSEXY,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"I would rent a car to get around. I like mountain biking, and would love to see the mountains and beautiful areas around Denver.

Denver,3bwyuf,Assorted-Jellybeans,2,Mon Jul 6 14:47:29 2015 UTC,"The only place that I know of that rents mountain bikes is the Bicycle Doctor. Some of my friends have rented from them, they had a good experience so ill point you that way. I don't mountain bike (im a road cyclist) so I cant give you towards any trails. If you want to see some nature, Id suggest driving up I-70 and meander back around through the mountains. If you want to hike, drive over to Boulder, there are plenty of trails just outside of town. I'd even suggest driving down to Colorado Springs to see Garden of the Gods.   Denver has an absolute plethora of breweries, so you'll have all the chances in the world to drink micro brews. Great Divide, Epic, TRVE, Comrade, and River North are all solid breweries. Denver Beer Co. has a nice location and is a great atmosphere to grab a beer, but their beer is mediocre.  Look up the schedule of Red Rocks Amphitheater for the dates you will be in town. If there is someone playing that you would want to see, GO SEE THEM. Its one of the best venues in the nation. Even if no one is playing that you want to see, go during the day and hike around and see the Amphitheater empty. Its stunning.   Can I answer anything else for you? More than happy to help."

Ill be traveling with one suitcase and one carry on so lugging those around all day will be somewhat limiting (i.e. no mountain climbing, but I'm not opposed to lugging them around downtown). I am partial to history so any worthwhile museums or local Denver historical areas of interest could be enticing. Similarly for any must hit breakfast or lunch joints. Also if anyone has a suggestion for a pot shop with a smoking room that could also be appreciated, as I could undoubtedly kill a few hours that way.  Thanks"
Denver,3bwyuf,ssldvr,2,Sun Jul 5 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"I would recommend just coming downtown and going up the 16th Street Mall.  You can easily visit the History Colorado Center and the Denver Art Museum.  You can also take a look at the State Capitol, the Molly Brown House or the Clyfford Still Museum.  Plenty to do downtown.  If you go to the Denver Art Museum, they have lockers that you can probably put your luggage in if it's not too bulky.  I don't smoke but my understanding is you won't have any trouble finding pot shops however, it's not legal to smoke in public so probably should just get some edibles until you can hang at your friend's place."

The high cost of living in Denver worries me, I am paying about $600 bucks a month for rent (a one bedroom downtown) right now which allows me to pursue my passions for climbing and skiing while still putting money away.  P.S. I would prefer not to spend more than 700 a month in rent  Question 1: Is the rising cost of rent in Denver an actually problem that should keep me from moving there, or is it being blown out of proportion?  Question 2: How far away is the skiing?   Question 3: Have any of you lived in SLC and Denver? If so, how does it compare. I'm a 25 year old liberal non-LDS white male with a business degree.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  TL;DR Is Denver too expensive and how does it compare to SLC."
Denver,3bwyuf,Assorted-Jellybeans,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"600 is going to be on the very cheap side of things, and only possible if you have a roommate. If you are living in a 1 bed expect at least 900-1000 depending on how close to the city you are.   The skiing isn't that far away, with no traffic you are looking at a 60 minute drive. However, with Colorado's exploding population, there is always traffic, and that drive seems to get longer and longer every year.   My family lived in Utah for a few years back in the 90's. Lets just say, your liberal non-LDS back ground wont be the minority anymore."
Denver,3bwyuf,hamiltmp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:43 2015 UTC,"Denver is much more expensive and the ski resorts suck compared to what you've got in SLC.

Denver,3bwyuf,Assorted-Jellybeans,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"Since you will be downtown already, there isn't any reason to leave the area. If there is a Rockies game that day, I'd suggest that, if the times work out. The mint is pretty solid, but you are correct it doesn't take up that much time. The Denver Art Museum is pretty good too, if that's your thing.   As far as beer goes, downtown and the close neighborhoods have a plethora of breweries to choose from. Great Divide is easily the best one in downtown. But if you head just a tad farther north from there, River North Brewery and Epic are great as well.   Grab some lunch at Euclid Hall or Biker Jims, you wont be disappointed with either choice.  Will you guys have a rental car? or will you be taking the shuttle to Union Station? If you are taking the shuttle, grab some brunch at Snooze, which is in the Station. If you have a car and can get around, go to Jelly."

Denver,3bwyuf,BungalowDweller,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"The Rockies are in town that day, it's a home game vs. the Angels, with a 6:40 start time. So even if you have to pick up your friends at the airport, you can still catch most of the game, if not the whole thing. I'd highly recommend it. Even if the Rockies suck, a summer night at Coors Field can't be beat. Tickets are super easy to get, either on stubhub at the ticket window, or just walking to the ballpark and catching a scalper.   All the other above suggestions are great ones that I can easily second.  Enjoy!"
Denver,3bwyuf,Tomes14,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Can you recommend  a good section  of the stadium  for tickets?  Id like to be close enough to see the game and not squint my eyes.

Denver,3bwyuf,Assorted-Jellybeans,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"Coors Field is one of those nice stadiums where there really isn't a bad seat in the house. I usually end up just getting the cheapest tickets available (The Rock Pile) then I just go hang out at the roof top bar and watch the game from there. (I also only watch maybe 2 innings of the game total. I mainly go for the atmosphere and socializing)   Seriously though, anything lower bowl is a good seat."

Denver,3bwyuf,BungalowDweller,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Sure - the first base line will have the best view of the sunset and mountains, but as you'll also be looking into the sun, that may not be optimal. That's also likely to be the most expensive ticket. I think the 3rd base line or right field would be your best options for seeing the game and taking in the view. The right field area will be cheaper. And it's pretty far from the game action, but there's also a great new rooftop deck and terrace in right field. I think that would qualify as the ""most fun"" though, as that area isn't just about watching the game, it's a pretty social area with some of the best views of the city and mountains. If I recall, you get can tickets to the rooftop for $15, which includes a concessions credit. It's mostly SRO though, so keep that in mind.  Enjoy!  And yeah, it looks like some rain, but hopefully it'll just be storms that move through quickly, but I would definitely recommend rain ponchos or umbrellas."

I will be moving to Denver on August 1 (I will be working at my current job until July 29) and need to have an apartment ready to move into on that date. I've already got a job, I just need the apartment...  I'm having some problems because a lot of the places on craigslist are through realty type places that require applications, application fees, backgrounds checks, and other things that make what should be a simple process into something much more difficult and costly. I should note that I would pass even the strictest background test and I've rented here in Iowa for 4 years without a single problem. I'm just pressed up against this August 1 date and I'm going to be out of the country from July 11-18, so I really will have no time to go to Denver before August 1.  It will just be me up until Thanksgiving, then my girlfriend will join me.  We're really not picky, I've got a budget of $800-$1300 a month and am willing to live anywhere from downtown Denver to the outer suburbs, as long as the apartment is nice and in a safe area.  I'm going to keep plugging away on craigslist, but any advice or tips in the meantime would be much appreciated!"
Denver,3bwyuf,fryburglar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:23:07 2015 UTC,A friend just moved from across the country and she had no issue doing the apartment applications and lease signing remotely. The market here is very competitive so renting an apartment won't as easy as it should be.

Denver,3bwyuf,BungalowDweller,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  You're right in the middle of everything, so you won't have too much trouble finding things to do. Do a little reading of the sidebar info ---> and you'll see lots of tips for things to do/see in the downtown/LoDo area.  That said, one of the best restaurants IMHO is literally at your feet. Panzano is on the first floor of the Hotel Monaco, and while it can be pricey, it's one of my favorites. Hit their happy hour for some good deals, and be sure to try their brussell sprouts, they're amazing.   Otherwise, head toward LoDo or Larimer Square, and you'll stumble upon dozens of great places to eat in various price ranges. While you're down there, check out Union Station or the Tattered Cover bookstore. Both great places to chill out for zero dollars. 16th Street is a pedestrian mall with a free shuttle. There's also a free shuttle on 18th and 19th, but I think that only runs during rush hours."

I know there are certain towns around the ""actual Denver Area"" that allow Pit breeds, and that's where I want to be. I'm not trying to break any laws and live with my pit in an area she isn't wanted. I wanna play by the rules and be somewhere she is accepted for the lovable lap dog she thinks she is. I am possibly aiming this request more toward someone who is a landlord who doesn't hate their breed. Or if you know anyone who is renting a house or something along those lines. We are very responsible tenants. My current landlord (who I've been renting from since 2010) said he will vouch for me to anyone who would like to talk to him. Anyone willing to give us guidance, or point us in a good direction would be greatly appreciated. In fact when we get to Denver I will personally make you some good ole' Louisiana Seafood Gumbo!

Denver,3bwyuf,BungalowDweller,2,Wed Jul 8 01:01:38 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I'm in Cole, and I absolutely love it up here, and I feel very safe.  Yes, there is still some gang activity - you may have heard about a couple shootings a few months back, but the violence is pretty much all gang-related, rather than random, and even gang activity seems to have really calmed down since then.  Otherwise, crime in the area is opportunistic and random - bikes and other equipment left outside where it can be seen, or the occasional garage break-in.   I've never felt unsafe in my home, and I often walk/bike to other parts of town at night, and have never experienced an issue. That said, I do try to be cautious, avoid certain blocks that look sketchy, and mostly just try to be aware of my surroundings.   In summary, I think you'll be fine up here. Though be aware that it's getting pretty pricey here pretty fast. A couple duplexes I was looking at buying 2 years ago at $200k just sold for $300k.  Feel free to PM me if you'd like more details."

Denver,3bzhs0,sammol,2,Fri Jul 3 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"Nothing too crazy - I'd say normal apartment complex complaints. The walls were incredibly thin, and I was often woken up by my neighbors arguing loudly at two in the morning. They did a terrible job of maintaining the parking lot in the winter - ice everywhere. Parking near some buildings can be a tremendous pain if you don't pay extra (it's not too much) for a covered spot. Apartments are old, kitchens are dated, things broke often enough to be annoying. It's also close to train tracks (thankfully, I only usually heard these during the day) and across the street from a fire station (woke up many times in the night because of this).   Then again, a lot of the problems I listed above were more issues created by my neighbors and not issues with the complex itself."

It can take 15-20m to make it up the hill, constant stop and go.  Not sure of your route, but I'd recommend coming in off 70 -> Colfax -> Indiana, so that you can go West along golden road (downhill!) and park in the gas-station parking lot in front of soopers  I'm not gonna make it up to Cabelas, but I'll be parked in that lot for the show - look for a speed triple w/ blue levers"

Plenty of other options that are just as good, possibly with a lower price! And in summer there are a variety of farmer's markets around town. There is one nearly every day of the week, at one of about six or eight spots for one or two days each, then they rotate through again the next week. I don't have a list on hand, but google generally serves me well when I'm on the hunt."

Denver,3bs3k1,CornDoggyStyle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you're taking your dog to a park and have to drive there, a quick 7 eleven stop isn't a big deal at all. It'd be so quick that the cool air in your car will still be plentiful from the ac.   But if you're bringing your dog along just to bring your dog along, leave it home. My neighbor used to run to the store and only the store. For some mundane reason she would bring her dog along just to have it sit in the car while she shops. It's pointless. She should've just left the dog at home so it can sit around there instead of in a hot car.   Dogs love adventures though. So I'll bring my pup along to the gas station.

I remember the instructor mentioned an advanced rider course they offered where you bring your own bike and do more technical stuff.  The basic course just to get the endorsement is very...basic.  It's also about a half day of classroom instruction and a written test, all of which you probably don't really need if your endorsement hasn't lapsed.  Oh, and if you do sign up for one, go for the earliest or latest session of the season that they offer, and bring sunscreen.  You're required to wear long pants/sleeves/boots the whole time, and all the riding is in parking lots with little to no shade."

The instructor Keith was awesome and really helpful. Since it was during the week the class was really small, only 4 people, so more attention was given to each individual rider. The most that can be in the class is 8 I believe.  The cost was $160 which is cheaper than Abate and a lot of other places. Full Throttle had a groupon that made theirs around $150 but G-Force was recommended on a few Colorado bike forums so I went with them instead and was very satisfied."

Absolutely incredible. I spent a summer living there and barely scratched the surface. PM me if you're headed up there and want to pick my brain.  Our state is pretty awesome, too.

Four corners is a fun spot if you are already out that way. Lots of national forest and national monument (junior national parks) as well. New Mexico has lots of awesome. Wyoming and SD as mentioned. Someone else mentioned the Grand Tour of national parks--that's a solid week if you want to stop for more than a stretch anywhere, but you can marathon it in a weekend if you don't mind sitting in your car most of the time. Arches as a solo stop is a very awesome weekend trip, though; just go out/visit/camp twice/return, about six hours each way.  Most of the midwest worth visiting as a tourist is not accessible from CO for a weekend, though. For that, stop in to St Louis/Chicago/Minneapolis/Milwaukee/Grand Rapids...Kansas City if you really want--it's decent but not close to much else.  Edit: Austin is probably a nice place, but is in Texas, not anything most Texans or westerners would consider west or midwest. It is 'west' only in relation to the Mississippi River, but not by most other definitions. Texas is more or less its own thing, a good place in its own right--but not generally considered 'the west'. California is sort of the same idea--yeah it is in the west, but would generally not come to mind when you say you are ""visiting the American West""."

Denver,3br0ab,AnhydrousEtOH,2,Wed Jul 1 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"Because rain sensors are useless. They sense moisture and cant determine the difference between 0.1"" or 5"" of rain.  For example, lets say I water my grass once a week for 1 hour to deliver the 1"" of rain grass typically needs. At the moment my once a week program is set to run, a passing drizzle trips the rain sensor and my program doesn't run. That drizzle delivers maybe 0.01"" of rain but since the rain sensor was wet, no sprinklers were turned on. And now my grass goes a whole week with 0.01"" of water. That to me is unacceptable performance from my irrigation system.   What people need are internet connected smart controllers that integrate watering needs with the forecast and how much rain has fallen."

We have many options, including Dora Moore school, Cheesman Park, City Park, Lowry and more.  EDIT: Also, Broomfield is not North Denver. This is probably going to confuse people who are trying to find places to play in Denver."
Denver,3bslz9,riomx,6,Wed Jul 1 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Dora Moore school, Cheesman Park, City Park, Lowry and more   Where can I find more info about dates/times of these pickup locations? Thx"
Denver,3bslz9,COulti_mIT_USer,4,Wed Jul 1 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like the organizing for City Park is inactive: http://www.meetup.com/DenverSoccer/events/15298920/  For Dora Moore though, any day on weekdays after 5 PM and early morning on Saturday and Sunday around 9 or 10 AM.  For Cheesman, I recommend getting there around 4:30 to beat the crowds and not wait to get into a game.  Not sure about Lowry because I haven't been to that one yet, but I just know that some people play because there is a full-size turf field.  At Wash Park you can also find games every day around 5 PM. They've been playing there for maybe 15 years and still going."
Denver,3bslz9,riomx,2,Wed Jul 1 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got downvoted, but you're right. I would add that Dora Moore games are pretty competitive pick up games, whereas Cheesman is more recreational. I've also heard that the group at Wash Park isn't very open to newcomers, and can get testy at times."
Denver,3bslz9,intestinal_fortitude,3,Thu Jul 2 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"I was just having this conversation with a friend of mine today. I've been playing pickup soccer in Denver since 2005 and I agree with what you've said. Here are a few notes to add:   Dora Moore is very competitive and crowded. A few friends and I started up the pickup games in 2010 and it slowly built up. At first we couldn't even get enough people on the field. After word spread and people started coming from other neighborhoods, it got really bad. Now the games get so crowded that 40-50 people show up and refuse to leave, so people end up forming teams of 10 people to play on a half-field and you can't get in until a team gets scored on. The games also began to get tense after a group of older South American guys started showing up a couple of years ago. All they do is bitch and moan and get aggressive, but no one stands up to them or kicks them out, so they are always there. There have been fights and embarrassingly, the cops have been called there before. Yikes. Cheesman is generally great if you get there early so you can join in on the first game. The first game is usually the most competitive. After that games get splintered off and they can be hit or miss, but there is a big chance that you'll get some game time if you show up no matter what. I will warn that there are a lot of holes in the ground, so make sure to watch your step. Wash Park is competitive and there is always a game going on. However, in my experience people have tended to get heated or in petty arguments, so it can be kind of annoying. I stopped going years ago because of that. Some of the guys that used to cause trouble at Wash Park also started going to Dora Moore, so unfortunately, you will encounter assholes at both places. City Park has always been a lot of fun and there is a core group of people that have had a long-running rec team that organize the pickup games. When I used to play at Dick's on rec teams I sometimes played against them, so I'd recognize them at City Park as well. I THINK they used to play Tuesdays and Thursdays because they would show up at Dora Moore on Mondays and Wednesdays (initially people didn't play every day at Dora Moore) to get an extra game or two during the week. Unfortunately, I didn't keep in touch with any of them, so I'm not sure what days they play anymore."
Denver,3bslz9,riomx,2,Thu Jul 2 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"Right on, thanks!  Dora Moore is turf, as well right? I always see people playing there but never got to checking it out. Now that I know the schedule I just might!"
Denver,3bslz9,COulti_mIT_USer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's turf. Ball moves a bit fast, but it's generally good and fun to play on."

Denver,3bryg7,thirtynation,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:27:04 2015 UTC,"The food is definitely not mediocre.  It's really good.  There's a reason there is a two hour wait, and has been for years.  That wouldn't be the case if it was run of the mill food.  That said, no restaurant is worth standing around waiting for two hours, in my opinion.  I would agree it's overhyped in that sense, but only because sheeple allow themselves to buy in to it and waste their time.

Denver,3bsbob,MattyDoodles,9,Wed Jul 1 19:18:43 2015 UTC,They'll likely tell you no charge for an outside job but then you'll see $50 on your first bill. Then you call and raise a fuss and they'll credit it off. I've had to do this 3 times in recent years.
Denver,3bsbob,K9ABX,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"If they come over you get charged $50. Even if they cause the problem. A few times my first year a comcast dude would come by and disconnect my line, I would call, wait a few days for another comcast dude to come by and take it off and the proceed to charge me $50.  I should add that if they touch the cable modem and the tv box, thats $50x2."

Denver,3bsbob,navajow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:27:38 2015 UTC,"They definitely will. I had a slightly different problem and I had to have a new line ran from the box through my wall. They charged $50 for that I think, which I was fine with because they did have to run cable and drill holes.   Then they also charged $100 for installing the service for me, which they didn't do. Something about a ""failed self install kit"" and that costs $100 even if you don't actually own their self install kit. I had everything hooked up myself and after he ran the line to the wall I screwed in the cable and had internet. They didn't troubleshoot shit or do anything other than run the wire to the wall and refuse to refund the charge. So be careful with that."
Denver,3bsbob,mikarm,0,Thu Jul 2 17:26:18 2015 UTC,They are supposed to be responsible for everything up to the building. The only problem is that you have to go through all the self-install bullshit before they will send someone to your house. Once you get your first bill be prepared to spend about 3 hours on the phone going from person to person until they will take the $50 charge off your bill.

Denver,3bmy8x,SteelChicken,12,Tue Jun 30 18:53:54 2015 UTC,Yes. Federal and state funding have a ton of variables in the equation. Sometimes spending money in one area reduces cost in another.

Go read Detroit's actual history, not what your shepherds over at Stormfront have told you. It became a major metropolis and model city because of unions. the workers all had jobs, and made a good living wage with job security. Detroid flourished and the whole area became one of the richest in the country. Then union busting happened. The unions were broken and the workers laid off. The manufacturing went to Mexico and China, leaving millions of the primary earners in the area with no job, a mortgage, and no way to sell the house and move since there were literally millions of others in the same boat.    It was not government mis management, it was not black crime, it was not lack of proper funding. It was breaking the unions followed by NAFTA.

I can tell you two things that will do more to change educational outcomes than anything else you can dream up:  1)  Improve the teacher/child ratio.  Class sizes / teacher have been growing and drifting for decades on end.   You can teach anything to a class of 10 or 15.   You can't teach a thing to a class of 45.  2)  To attract teaching talent, you'll need to make teaching wages competitive with other professions that also require (often multiple) master's degrees.    A fully loaded teaching education costs north of half a million dollars, but has wages starting often under $40k/year.    Americans expect teachers to be superhuman substitute-parents, counselors, wardens, mentors, babysitters, political appointees, defenders of (ideology x), marksmen, guards, inspirations, work 15 hours a day during the week and coach on the weekends.    But for all that, it's a job with no career track.  There's no ""promotion"" from teacher.  And the compensation, with a few astonishing exceptions, is shit.   I've got a lot more fixes, of course, but if those were in place, you'd see American education change profoundly for the better."

Denver,3bmy8x,DarthBarney,2,Tue Jun 30 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"It's actually not that at all.  per pupil spending last year by the state's contribution was just under $1000/student, (though the majority of pps comes from local property and mill levies).  The DougCO voucher program would have granted a limited number of students (~500) a tuition voucher of roughly $4500/ea, or slightly more than 4.5x's their state's allotted amount, in essence stealing money from the district to fund secular education.  There are more than 63K students in DougCO implying less that 1% of the students were eligible for the vouchers.   Just how those students were selected is a mystery, but speculation is high there would be favouritism.  There are so many problems with the DougCO voucher program it's hard to start identifying them all, but one thing is clear, Colorado Constitution's IX Amendment, Section 7  ""Aid to private schools, churches, sectarian purpose, forbidden. Neither the general assembly, nor any county, city, town, township, school district or other public corporation, shall ever make any appropriation, or pay from any public fund or moneys whatever, anything in aid of any church or sectarian society, or for any sectarian purpose, or to help support or sustain any school, academy, seminary, college, university or other literary or scientific institution, controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatsoever; nor shall any grant or donation of land, money or other personal property, ever be made by the state, or any such public corporation to any church, or for any sectarian purpose.""

Denver,3bmy8x,DarthBarney,2,Wed Jul 1 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected.  I was incorrectly referencing the amount the state contributes to PPS, not taking into consideration school district mill levies and/or property taxes (the majority contributor to PPS), nor federal contributions, (which is negligible).  FTR, the national average is a little more $9K.  Regardless, it is considerably more than the averages parent's total contribution in taxes, (considering the amount is aggregated from all taxes).  Nothing more than a subsidy to send one's child to a sectarian school.  This site has some decent stats.  FTR, the voucher programs is still in conflict with state constitution amendment 9.  DCSD's only argument in a SCOTUS challenge is that Colorado Amendment IX is unconstitutional, but they'll have a tough time getting around the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment...

One way is to buy a very good education. The other way is to destroy the education of others. Doing both is a bonus. There is no way that a rich parent wants their kid to lose to a poor, hard-working, talented kid that gets the education they need to win."

It would escalate costs for the rest of the city, and create the notion that the wealthy are entitle  And that's what's going on here.

Wealthy families can afford whatever they want for their children regardless, but an individual child's share of the funds can make a big difference to a family that's not wealthy but wants to give their child an alternative to the public school system. One child's share is not going to make a difference to the public school -- if the child went to the school it'd be spent on him, but he's not so it won't be, and the vast majority of taxpayers are still funding the school system even if they have no children attending -- but it can make every bit of difference to a family that wants to give their child the best education they can."

We put up the ad and really stated the true condition of the car, didn't want anyone to be surprised.  Didn't even clean up the inside, just wanted to get rid of it.  Insurance company had totaled it because of hail, but we had a clean title.   Wrote up a Bill Of Sale stating AS IS with no warranty, cash only.  Got a little worried when the guy who ultimately purchased it, asked us if he could leave it on the street outside our house until he had the ability to tow it.  Once we sold it, we removed our plates.  I was a little worried that the city would tow it as unlicensed cars are not allowed to park in the street.  We did warn him that because it didn't have plates, it might get towed. But he came and got it two days later without incident.    We had sold a car on Craigs years earlier, as is.  It needed thousands of dollars of work on the engine (German car).  Sold with Bill of Sale stating AS IS.  Asshat who bought it from us for $800.00, took it home, detailed it and posted it for sale on Craigs for $2500.  In the end, we could sleep at night, but I do wonder about his ability."

I didn't say all places that serve beer are tap houses -- that would be an insane claim, only that most breweries in Denver are tap houses.  And all tap houses are bound to laws restricting their sales of anything not produced in-house.   To add to Vine, Breck Brewery (the one on Blake), Black Sky Brewery, Wynkoop Brewery, Rock Bottom, Yak & Yeti, Bush & Bull...and I'm sure more all serve food and have a full bar.  But they don't represent the majority of breweries, by far."
Denver,3brfp7,BEERT3K,2,Wed Jul 1 19:27:00 2015 UTC,"maybe i misunderstood your claim, just wanted OP to know there are plenty of spots in Denver that brew their own beer on site, as well as serve other's beer/wine/liquor. cheers m8!"
Denver,3brfp7,riomx,4,Wed Jul 1 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"Not a brewery, but if you want to stay around Downtown, Denver Bicycle Cafe has rotating beers on tap and they have great relationships with Colorado breweries, so they always have a good variety. Also, they currently have a bunch of ciders from Stem on tap, so there would be something for your girlfriend to try as well.  My other suggestion would be to check out Colorado Plus on 38th Ave in Wheat Ridge. They have 50 Colorado beers on tap and rotate them every 2 weeks. They have a variety of styles of beer and a few non-beer alcoholic drinks, including ciders."
Denver,3brfp7,BrunetteLina_Inverse,3,Wed Jul 1 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Colorado Plus also has locally brewed Kombucha on tap, for those who like it."

Denver,3brfp7,incidentalmusic,2,Wed Jul 1 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"I gave up beer for the whole year. I still go to taprooms with my friends.

Denver,3bq0lh,digital_evolution,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"I bought a house last year and got an inspection. I have to say that the inspection process is the biggest rip off that I have ever been taken in by. We got a large binder, mostly full of standard boilerplate information(couple hundred pages). This morning, I paid an AC company $725 for repairs, and the whole time the tech inspected the system, he kept saying, ""Code violation, code violation..."" I've spent a lot of money in the last year on this house, and little of what I had to do was in the report! Accept this single truth: the inspector is beholden to the real estate trade for references, good word of mouth, etc. The inspector role is fundamentally flawed due to the need to not 'spoil a deal'. If it makes you feel better, get an inspection. But accept that you simply can't rely on inspectors to give you an honest, full accounting of a house's deficiencies/problems.  PS: I don't think you can even rely on an inspector to bring major flaws to your attention. We got an inspection and a separate engineer's report, and they still didn't find substantial settling issues."

Denver,3bq0lh,dalahorse76,4,Wed Jul 1 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"You're not going to get a decent condo with a garage in any major U.S. city for $200k. Denver's real estate prices have recently adjusted to better fit the norm.  That doesn't indicate an out of control market or a bubble.  There is a local trend of listing houses for low prices knowing much higher offers will be made. It seems to lead many buyers to believe they can afford properties more easily than they may be able to. It also turns the early part of the buying process (viewing, offering, negotiating) into a race that intimidates a lot of people.   Best wishes in your search. Definitely expand your search area to get in the price range you're looking at."
Denver,3bq0lh,jadeoracle,8,Wed Jul 1 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"I was looking in that exact same price range last year. You have a bunch of problems.   Firstly, there isn't a lot of inventory in that price range. This is because a few years ago, many condo/townhome builders were getting sued for bad/faulty building, and could be sued by a group of the homeowners. This plus the downturn in the economy put a chill on building condo/townhomes for sale (while they still built a ton for rent.) So inventory is low.   You then have a requirement of a garage. I also had this requirement. It is hit or miss on if a condo will have a garage or not, so you are already making the low condo inventory options lower by looking for a garage. Don't give up, but just know it is a limiting search criteria.   You next issue is price. 200K price range is where a lot of first time home buyers and single home buyers price range, so there is a TON of competition. I was getting out bid 20-30% higher than asking. (And I got into at least 5 bidding wars.) I was loosing to full cash offers. I looked for about 5 months (from when I put my last place on the market, to when I finally got an accepted offer). I saw hundreds of condos/townhomes/homes. I placed in dozens and dozens of offers. I almost gave up hope...and then saw how high rents were. I then got an offered accepted (at 50K higher than my budget, but I was getting desperate). And then the place failed inspection. Not only did it fail, but the entire neighborhood I had fallen in love with (and had gotten into bidding wars) had the same issues. So I had to start all over. :(   The only way I got my place was by seeing it as the first person (it was on the market for less than 20 minutes. (Literally saw the posting, left work and went directly there. Thankfully my work understood and let me leave just randomly throughout the day, and I'd make it up in the evenings.) I put in an offer 20% higher, and had an escalation clause. I also said the owners could choose move out date (I was staying with family and so wasn't tied down anywhere) so that way they had time to find their own place. I had a strong 30% down in cash.   I wish you luck. I've checked the neighborhoods I had been looking at...and in the last year their prices have skyrocketed, so it will be even harder to find in the 200k price range. Heck I'd say the 150-300 price range is a hot market range right now, and will be tough competition."
Denver,3bq0lh,jadeoracle,6,Wed Jul 1 14:24:16 2015 UTC,"OP One other thing I just remembered about searching for Condos with a garage:  If living space is over your own garage, make sure to test that fumes from the garage cannot get into the living space. Then check how loud the garage opening/closing is when you are in the living space. Some of the ones I looked at, the garage opening/closing was so loud it made it impossible to rent out the rooms to other people, or have sensitive children living in them as it was just too loud.   The loudness rule is even more of an issue if your living space is over multiple people's garages. I saw many units that the living space for one unit, was over 2-3 garages. I realized that the noise and possible fumes were not worth finding a ""deal"" when it was other people's garages you were living over."

Buyers are offering emotionally and then once they have the property under contract they're rethinking their decisions, changing their minds or trying to use inspection and/or appraisal to renegotiate with the seller. Right now 13% of  all properties fall out of contract with their first buyer, and come back on the market. Rather than competing for the newly-listed properties, you may want to try having your agent search the MLS for properties that are two or three weeks old and back on the market. Keep in mind, sometimes the name of the game in this market is Timing and Luck."
Denver,3bq0lh,jadeoracle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I was a ""backup offer"" on a few properties as I saw this trend as well. However, be wary if you are a backup offer and it happens a long time after the offer was put in, this could be a sign of a failed inspection. And I will say I also became one of those buyers that emotionally put in offers or bids. I only pulled out twice once during bidding phase, as I realized there were too many negatives and so choose not to respond to the counter-offer. And then my dream place that failed inspection.   Heck even my own place saw a good offer the first week (this was early last year before it got ""crazy"".) but after 48 hours the buyer backed down saying she needed to rethink as she thought the place was ""too expensive"". I was crushed until the next week I got an even better full cash offer."

That will definitely stop some people from getting into the market, but considering only a complete moron would get a 5 year ARM, the majority of people will get along just fine. Add to that that investors will likely keep buying up lots in Denver for scrapes, as well as all the people who likely keep moving here ans want to be close to downtown, and you can see why property in Denver isn't a huge risk right now. Basically all higher interest rates mean is slower house value appreciation.    Already people are spending WAY more than what is considered a healthy income/debt ratio.  Just looking at the Denver median household income to median house price indicates people here are willing to become house poor.  That will end badly.     The median house income in Denver was just under $63,000 (in 2013) and the median home price was about $310,000 (from what I could find) right now. Using Zillows calculator, youd need around a $25,000 down payment (only around 8%) and you'd be well placed to buy that house at around a 36% debt-to-income ratio.

Denver,3bq0lh,drecksau,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"No. There certainly is inventory below $300K in fine neighborhoods, you just might have to commute a bit."
Denver,3bq0lh,amber0517,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"I bought my 1/1 in Wash Park for asking price, which came in below appraisal.  I was like you in the whole ""need a garage"" thing, but that kind of drove it all into stupid pricing territory.  I want to say it was my 7th or 8th offer.  Keep at it, you'll get one."
Denver,3bq0lh,Thole90091,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:49:21 2015 UTC,We just won our 6th offer in Arvada. Listed at 260 and offered 290. We were the second highest offer but we won because of our super fast closing date (thanks mortgage guy!) that and we had an appraisal shortfall clause up to 5k. Ended up appraising for 4k less so we had to pay that in cash.
Denver,3bq0lh,drecksau,4,Wed Jul 1 12:28:04 2015 UTC,YEP. We had to basically get everything done in two weeks. It was a nightmare. (INCLUDING inspection)

Denver,3boqnm,zeblackun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:58:59 2015 UTC,Heard a lot about this place. What makes it so cool?
Denver,3boqnm,Overtalk,2,Wed Jul 1 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"Check out their gallery http://forestroom5.com/#gallery.  It's decorated very weirdly, so many little details everywhere.  Also their outside patio area makes it feel like you're in a forest.  Great atmosphere."
Denver,3boqnm,TheBeerChasers,13,Wed Jul 1 18:31:50 2015 UTC,Williams and Graham is a pretty cool speak easy.  I know some people who get offended but it's mostly because they don't understand what speak easy's are.
Denver,3boqnm,zeblackun,3,Tue Jun 30 23:30:40 2015 UTC,I came here to say this. Williams and Graham is an amazing bar! Not somewhere where you become a regular but definitely a very interesting and fun place to bring people!  Also I've heard that its the only bar not on the east or west coast to be rated one of the top bars in the world.
Denver,3boqnm,FirewhiskyGuitar,2,Wed Jul 1 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what about it offends people?"
Denver,3boqnm,TheBeerChasers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"Mostly the long wait times I think.  I don't think people understand they don't want it to be super crowded and people standing everywhere so they make sure everyone can have a seat which results in longer than desired wait times so people get annoyed especially when they hear 30 minute wait, then decide to go somewhere else for a bit, come back 45 minutes later then are surprised their spot was taken."
Denver,3boqnm,tuffstough,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"Well OP was referring to the opposite, but I get offended when people call it a ""speakeasy"". it not, its a normal bar with some cool secret things and a retro vibe."
Denver,3boqnm,ParadoxPenis,2,Wed Jul 1 12:12:22 2015 UTC,"I would say that it tries to hard to be the novelty it is trying to be, and is a bit on the nose for a speakeasy. That is, Williams and Graham feels like a disneyland ride, it doesn't feel like a real speakeasy.   There is a bar in NYC where you enter through a phone booth and the bar itself is dark and awesome. Feels like a real speakeasy.  Williams and Graham doesn't feel like that, it just feels like a bar with a theme."
Denver,3boqnm,dryhandy,2,Wed Jul 1 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"Union lodge #1 is a nice alternative to Williams if the wait time is killing you. Well made, delicious drinks in a cool historical location."
Denver,3boqnm,remarquian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the feedback on this place everyone, it's been on my list to visit for a while, but I haven't been able to convince friends it's worth a guaranteed 20-30 minute wait.  Has anyone done the ""decipher"" mystery / puzzle thing they put on?"
Denver,3boqnm,TheBeerChasers,2,Wed Jul 1 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'd pass on W&G.  It is like the Disney version of a Speakeasy.   You wait along time, go through a fake bookstore, and then wait some more for a seat.  Green Russell is way better."
Denver,3boqnm,tuffstough,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:26 2015 UTC,Try to go before 8PM on a weekday that's no Thursday or Friday if you can.  I've gone on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings and have only had to wait 10 mins tops or get right in.  No idea on the puzzle though.
Denver,3boqnm,TheBeerChasers,-5,Wed Jul 1 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"ha! are you seriously calling williams and graham a speakeasy while saying others dont know what a speakeasy is? In order to be a ""speakeasy"", a bar would need to operate illegally, IE not pay taxes or observe other liqour laws. Having a secret entrance and calling your bar a speak easy does not make it one. that is called marketing. Just like how moonshine is illegally produced whiskey, but people have convinced you that by putting ""moonshine"" on their bottles it becomes moonshine somehow."
Denver,3boqnm,tuffstough,2,Wed Jul 1 12:11:27 2015 UTC,Yeah because that would be a way to maintain a business.  It's the closest thing we have to speakeasy's now and it's just easier to call it that.
Denver,3boqnm,GringodelRio,0,Wed Jul 1 14:26:16 2015 UTC,You really think actual speakeasy's don't exist?
Denver,3boqnm,kozmonautilus,3,Wed Jul 1 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"Kate's Wine Bar in Littleton is cozy, feels like a speakeasy and is hidden off a side street from Littleton Blvd. It was nice, drinks were amazing, and the price so-so."
Denver,3boqnm,zeblackun,3,Tue Jun 30 23:40:57 2015 UTC,Double Daughters is pretty funky. Gothic/steampunk vibes. Market & 17th.
Denver,3boqnm,shithawkk,5,Wed Jul 1 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"OneUp is pretty cool! Its got a little younger of a crowd but still fun. Its an old school arcade bar and it sells 40s so thats fun.  Also I came here to say Williams and Graham. Its a speak easy in LOHI thats seriously so cool! Definitely check it out.   And to add to this, you should check out The Denver Passport. Its basically a coupon book with more class but its got over 50 buy one get one to all the coolest bars in Denver. Definitely will help expand your horizons."
Denver,3boqnm,I_Think_Alot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:56:54 2015 UTC,OneUp is a pretty fun place. The 40's will set you back 10 bones compared to like 2 at a liquor store. But hey it's a bar so what are you gonna do

Denver,3boqnm,plentyofrabbits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:52:21 2015 UTC,My favorite part about The Denver Passport is that everybody on this site mentions it constantly and it's been sold our for at least 6 months. Sounds like a great idea but we all missed out.   Will a new edition ever come out?
Denver,3boqnm,afc1886,3,Wed Jul 1 07:21:41 2015 UTC,They just released a new one. It also sold out in like three seconds.

Denver,3boqnm,dueljester,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"Love both 1Up locations, definitely a fun time!  But, in my experience, they're not necessarily to good places to socialize.  The LoDo location especially is packed every single time I go, with music blasting to the point where you have to yell for anyone to hear you."
Denver,3boqnm,tuffstough,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:34:25 2015 UTC,Ya i agree. I would never go to the lodo one. Or any bar in lodo really unless it was after a rockies game. But I love the Colfax location
Denver,3boqnm,TheBeerChasers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"One up is awesome if you go pre-10PM during the weekend.  Once it gets packed it becomes pretty terrible imo.  To many bro's that can't handle their beer bumping into one another or trying to claim a game they want if someone's been playing ""to long""."
Denver,3boqnm,pop-rox,-7,Wed Jul 1 19:33:39 2015 UTC,I feel like I am just going through this thread correcting people. Speak easys dont pay taxes and dont follow liquor laws. williams and graham does both those things.

Denver,3boqnm,BungalowDweller,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I've actually been to Dazzle, really cool place, but most people I know aren't fans of jazz music, so I rarely go...the others sound like they're definitely worth checking out!"
Denver,3boqnm,mr_manalishi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"If you like jazz, check out Nocturne, which recently opened in RINO. It's more of a traditional jazz supper club, and is more upscale to Dazzle's more divey feel. It's a great space with great bartenders, so maybe your friends would enjoy that even if they don't care for the jazz."
Denver,3boqnm,mierda4352,2,Tue Jun 30 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"Nocturne has some solid performances but is wayyy overpriced especially when they try to market it as the workingperson's supper club.   While we are talking about pricing, Dazzle has a fantastic burger/finish-the-keg deal on Wednesday nights."
Denver,3boqnm,lddebatorman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:57 2015 UTC,"True. Nocturne is billing itself as rather upscale, and you do pay for it. But I like it.   Though, yeah, it's hard to pass up the Wednesday night deal at Dazzle, though I miss the spoken word/amateur nights they used to do."

Denver,3boqnm,codemoney,2,Wed Jul 1 01:47:38 2015 UTC,"Cruise Room sounds like it's worth a visit, if nothing else because of the history.  On the list!  As is Crown Social, especially with happy hour until 8...codemoney, I don't see anything about it being a gay bar?  Fainting Goat is fun, but nothing too unique about it from the times I've been.  An art bar sounds fun, will have to check out that one too!  And I actually saw a friend's band at New Climax recently (AKA Randall's), definitely somewhere I'd go back."
Denver,3boqnm,BlackbeltJones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:28:12 2015 UTC,Crown Social is different from black crown. I don't know about crown social. I have since learned that black crown is closed so my information is OBE.
Denver,3boqnm,codemoney,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:12 2015 UTC,could you describe what makes those special? Or are they just good atmosphere places?
Denver,3boqnm,BlackbeltJones,2,Wed Jul 1 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"Cruise Room is one of Denver's original speakeasies, Black Crown (which I guess is called the Crown Social now) has a meandering interior similar to Park House, another interesting place, but instead of a house, it's a gaudy old hotel, and Dada is a small place with rotating art exhibits, a good crowd, and good food & drink options.  The others are mostly crowd/atmosphere."
Denver,3boqnm,DeviatedNorm,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"Fainting goat is an irish pub. It has a rooftop patio which looks down on south broadway.  If you ever wanted to be the Jack Nicholas character from the Shining, then go into the Cruise Room. It is close to that feel and maybe the bartender won't mind you calling him Lloyd.   Black Crown is an antique store by day and gay bar by night. Interesting to be sure but since I am not gay I would feel like I am intruding on their space."
Denver,3boqnm,BlackbeltJones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"It's not strictly a gay bar. It's about as gay as Charlie Brown's... so it's only kinda gay.  Good food, drinks (all of which are produced in Colorado), and crowd, nonetheless, for one and all."

Denver,3bnuyv,BlackbeltJones,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"It's generally better to go to a realtor first, and they can refer you to a lender who can help you see if you qualify. The rest of the process goes more smoothly when your realtor is used to working with your lender, and realtors will only refer you to lenders that they trust to close, so you're a lot less likely to end up with a bad one."
Denver,3bnuyv,snarfelgarfel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"I started with a pre-approval, and dealing with the bank slowed down the close. If I had it to do over, I would've started with a mortgage broker suggested by a realtor."

Also, keep in mind that the market is brutal in Denver right now. If you're looking in the 200-300k range, you'll be competing against a ton of people and they won't be in the ""coolest"" parts of town. If you're in the 350k+ market, things are a little better,  but you'll have to compete against cash investors."

I work with lots of first time homebuyers. The market is nuts right now - be forewarned!  Hit me up with any questions."
Denver,3bnuyv,alittleroy101,0,Tue Jun 30 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"With the market being so hot, is a first time buyer pretty much completely hosed right now? I mathed it out, and it would take me 4-6 years (depending on how much I can save) to save enough for a 20% down payment on a 350k house (which seems about what I should expect to pay right now). That's... a long time, especially when I am currently renting so I'm essentially lighting that money on fire every month. It has honestly really discouraged me that I'll be able to get my own place, but maybe it's not as bad as it seems to someone uninitiated in these matters."
Denver,3bnuyv,bigstrat2003,0,Wed Jul 1 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"First things first - if you're looking in the 350k range you are far from hosed.  There is less buy pressure in that area than in the sub 300k - that's where the real madness is.   Next, don't expect to put 20% down. That is a lot of cash.  Depending on your financial situation, you can get a 3.5% FHA loan, or you can do a 5% conventional loan. Some lenders even have 3% conventional loans, but the rates are going to be the worst on those ones.  If you do not have money for a down payment, there are down payment assistance programs that you can look into. CHFA will pay up to about $5k of your down payment, assuming you fall into their max income requirements (which are quite generous).   Potentially, in 4 to 6 years, if you are saving for a 20% down payment on a 350k house, you may be priced out of the market. It then becomes a never-ending chase to save up enough before housing prices rise above your purchasing ability.   I can recommend a rock solid lender if you'd like, who will walk you through the process and will be there every step of the way, including sitting at the closing table with you when you get the keys."
Denver,3bnuyv,alittleroy101,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:44:33 2015 UTC,"What should one aim for in terms of a down payment, then? I was under the impression that 20% is pretty much the standard, but as I said... never owned a home.  I should also clarify that I'm not per se looking at the 350k range, it just seemed (from a cursory glance) like that was what it was going to take in order to get a decent home (I didn't search particularly hard, since I was looking to get an idea of how much to save rather than with intent to buy). Since I'm single, I don't need the world - all I really want is a place I own, and can make my own rules rather than being limited to what my landlord allows (in particular I have a big dog, which makes finding a rental challenging). If I had a two-bedroom place (one to use, one to turn into an office or guest bedroom), that'd be plenty for me, so my needs are not extravagant by any means. I assume that, as with renting, location makes a big difference (i.e. a place in the suburbs costs less than a place downtown), but what would you expect a 2-bedroom home to go for in various places around the area?  I do appreciate the offer to point me in the direction of a lender, but I have only scratched the surface of this topic so I'm not looking to buy just yet. Right now, I'm trying to save money for a down payment so I may not be buying for a while (depending on how much that winds up being and how disciplined I am with saving)."

Denver,3bn5q2,sachiel416,27,Tue Jun 30 15:47:15 2015 UTC,Restrict your communication to letters.  Send a balance verification request letter to the collections agency.  They must show you proof of the debt once you request it.
Denver,3bn5q2,jgonz85,10,Tue Jun 30 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"Funny enough I'm still getting notices from them for someone who used to live at the place I'm now renting over 2 years ago.  I keep writing ""Send back, no longer lives here"" but they keep sending the bills/collections notices."
Denver,3bn5q2,TheBeerChasers,5,Tue Jun 30 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"I hate to defend them but if they work like my office does the billing dept probably has no idea the mail is being returned.  (For my job) Billing auto sends invoices, but the receptionists get the returned mail and call to verify the address.  I've seen accounts that have 5-10 notes saying we've left a message to get an updated address and yet billing continues to bill to the wrong address."
Denver,3bn5q2,AtomicJesusCO,10,Tue Jun 30 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but Century Link related:  Century Link is rolling out gigabit internet in the area and they have people going door to door selling it. I signed up for gigabit service and later in the evening I was going through the paperwork I was given and 40Mb service was marked off. I thought it was a mistake so I called to correct it before anything was shipped out. They told me gigabit isn't available in my area yet and they don't have a timeframe for when it will become available. Thankfully customer support cancelled the service order hassle free.  So double check your paperwork before signing anything and getting your hopes up for gigabit service. Even though it was easy to cancel, it took nearly an hour of waiting before I was able to talk to someone."

Not only did they not cancel the service,  they sent equipment to me. Then when I returned the equipment,  they claimed they didn't receive it,  which was a lie,  and they still were billing me for service that was never enabled.  It took MONTHS for it to get resolved.    Side note,  they still don't have gigabyte service in my area. Even if they did I wouldn't use it after how I was treated."
Denver,3bn5q2,Skizzaa,8,Tue Jun 30 22:34:11 2015 UTC,In the US (not sure about CO specifically) the burden of proof is on the person or company demanding payment. Tell them to shove it and check your credit report often. Obviously dispute anything with the bureau.
Denver,3bn5q2,snowcase,6,Tue Jun 30 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your misfortune.   A few years ago, I paid the balance on a Home Depot card off early even though I still had about 4 months at 0% interest. Unfortunately, my payment didn't post until the day after the due date.  Over time a $15 late fee climbed up to $86 and I was sent to collections. I had no idea, because I'd never received any calls or correspondence about the issue. I just figured I had a zero balance since I paid the card off.  I didn't hear anything about it until I got the call from collections. I settled the balance, but because I was reported, my credit score was brought down over 100 points. Before that I had near-perfect credit.   I tried calling the credit score companies to try and clear the negative report, but I just kept being sent to calling centers in India and repeatedly hung up on by people that didn't speak English very well. It was extremely frustrating because I got fucked and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. And all because I decided I wanted to pay a credit card off early.  I hope you have better luck than I did. My credit has recovered now, but I would have preferred that it never happened in the first place."
Denver,3bn5q2,riomx,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"4 months at 0% interest. Unfortunately, my payment didn't post until the day after the due date.   They held the payment four months? I don't understand."
Denver,3bn5q2,GrantNexus,4,Tue Jun 30 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"That has nothing to do with payment. 0% interest sign-up deals usually go for 6 months to a year. I had 4 months without interest accumulating on my balance, but I wanted to pay it off early."
Denver,3bn5q2,riomx,4,Tue Jun 30 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"He had 4 months of 0% interest left, but rather than send 4 equal payments to pay it off over the 4 months he sent one balloon payment to pay the entire thing off.  The problem is, his next payment was scheduled for X day, and his payment (regardless of amount) didn't post until X+1 day (for example, due the 15th, they didn't get it until the 16th).  Technically he was late.  The fact that they apparently had zero grace period is shitty though, and I wonder if they didn't do that specifically to make a few bucks since he wasn't paying interest."

When I was 18-19 I worked for a call center that serviced accounts for AT&T Broadband, which later became part of Comcast.  I will forever feel dirty to the core of my soul for being unable to help people who turned in modems but never got any paperwork.

Denver,3bn5q2,riomx,0,Tue Jun 30 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"Proof wont stop you from having to deal with their bullshit though.  Had one of their modems. Returned it via UPS with tracking. I see it arrives and is signed for. I then get a bill due for the modem saying they never received it. Call customer service and even with the rep typing the tracking number in and saying ""Yeah I see it was delivered"" I have to get upgraded to her manager.  Manager asks me to repeat the tracking number again and then says it will be resolved. She suggests I pay the fine anyways and then they'll credit my account. Told her no. She puts me on hold for 30 minutes or so and then says she is going to conference call the delivery guy at their warehouse and her manager. She then hangs up on me.  Call back and have to do the entire process again. All told, took me 2.5ish hours to resolve the fact that even though I had UPS confirmation that ""Bob"" signed for my modem before they would credit my account.   Meanwhile this is after having to ask THREE times for them to send me a return box to return the damn thing."

Really unsetting, couldn't stop thinking about the movie.  Another good one without too much gore is ""It Follows"" which came out last summer. I'm pretty tough against scares but this movie had me with actual shivers and goosebumps. It's almost ""The Shining"" level scary to me anyway. Really great synth soundtrack and late 70s/80s feel to it. Great camera work and cinematography too."

I'm totally with you on Ray, when I was a kid I would watch stuff like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and his Sinbad/Sword-and-Sandal flicks with my dad, who I can't thank enough for introducing me to such great movies at a young age.)"

It is a great old school hamburger join that is featured on the food network. What is cool about is is that it is a working/middle class restaurant surrounded by glitzy bars and yuppie apartments. A good buy there is a hamburger with bacon and peanut butter on it, sound weird but tastes amazing."

Denver,3boqgf,uber2016,2,Fri Jul 3 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"I live in the area. If you are staying in/close to Cherry Creek North check out these area restaurants that I personally love:   Hapa (Sushi & Sake) Syrup (breakfast) Machete (Mexican: tacos & tequila) Little Ollies (Chinese) True Food Kitchen (eco-healthy, but great) Harman's Eat & Drink (American) Second Home Kitchen & Bar (American)   Everyone will say Cherry Cricket for burgers, and it is worth trying but I'm not a fan. Sure it's historic, but that doesn't make up for bad food and sometimes bad service. Mac & Cheese bites are amazing though.   Downtown is a 20~ minute bike ride on a paved trail from Cherry Creek. You can rent a bike behind the Cherry Creek mall for around $8 (plus time). Definitely lots more to see/do downtown."

Denver,3bllkz,lmg6841,4,Tue Jun 30 15:10:23 2015 UTC,I'm never going to check that sub unless my own pets go missing. Why would that be a good idea?
Denver,3bllkz,yeradolt,-1,Tue Jun 30 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"Why would that be a good idea?   Why are there dozens of facebook pages and alternative forums for posting lost pet info? Why does any lost pet page / forum / website exist? Are those totally useless because nobody goes there unless their own dog is lost? Clearly it would make more sense for EVERY poster on every one of those pages / sites to just take out an ad in the paper or something.   It would be a good idea because enough people turn to reddit for info on lost and found pets. It would also potentially allow interested redditors to establish a relationship between organizations like DFL and ::drum roll:: a local lost pet sub. That way if I personally found a dog, I would post it, if you lost a dog, you'd post that, maybe if someone from DFL or another org. did an intake of a local potentially lost dog they could post that dog.   Such a heady concept, I know."
Denver,3bllkz,lmg6841,4,Tue Jun 30 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Everyone in Denver is much more likely to check r/denver multiple times a day, while the missing pet sub will only get people actively interested in missing pets. If I don't see the post of a missing pet, I'm far less likely to keep an eye out for that pet.  These posts are designed to get the casual Denver resident to keep an eye out for the pet, not organization whose job it is to rescue/return lost pets."
Denver,3bllkz,yeradolt,-3,Tue Jun 30 17:46:58 2015 UTC,Fuck this sub in general. Enjoy your lost dog / stolen car / internet speed / traffic update stream.
Denver,3bllkz,lmg6841,3,Tue Jun 30 18:27:43 2015 UTC,It sounds like you have a problem being in a communal space and seem to forget that r/denver reflects what's going on in the real world.
Denver,3bllkz,yeradolt,-2,Tue Jun 30 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, making a suggestion about improving the community-wide content is definitely a detriment to the community.   Your position = reflective of reality  My suggestion ≠ reflective of reality  Mind you reality clearly and objectively contains a world where we can have /r/colorado, /r/denver /r/denverlist /r/denvermusic /r/DenverBroncos /r/denvernuggets /r/denverjobs /r/COsnow /r/COents all coexist despite the potential that ALL of those posts could be aggregated in one sub. It's almost like, in reality, there are thousands of niche subreddits that are still trafficked on a daily basis.   /r/Denver is more likely to be accessed by a wider group of people. So advertising or seeking services or looking for or renting an apartment, or finding a ride to the mountains, or a discussion of Peyton Manning's dick, by your logic, would be far more accessible to the ""casual Denver resident"" and they should be posted here.   Like I said, fuck this sub anyways. It's a cesspool of low information circlejerk posts. Keep a lookout for my stolen car and bike and my internet connection and shitty drivers while you're hunting down all these lost dogs that need to be posted here twice a day."

Denver,3bieoe,StartledDungbeetle,3,Tue Jun 30 04:36:44 2015 UTC,"The DDFL is an awesome org! Efforts in the Denver metro area to spay and neuter pets before they are adopted have been so successful that DDFL imports dogs from area that have far too many so there are enough pets for adopters. The municipal shelter also shares dogs with them. Dogs are rarely put down for lack of space in Denver these days though it can happen. It's more likely to happen when an animal is sick or bites but even those dogs are given a chance by being put in a foster home for a while to see if the dog is just reacting badly to the shelter environment.   So, it's ok to take dogs there and there is a very good chance they will be adopted instead of put down."
Denver,3bieoe,pookierawrz,0,Mon Jun 29 18:02:57 2015 UTC,Maxfund is a no kill shelter. Dumb Friends league will put animals down. I recommend Maxfund.
Denver,3bieoe,diealchemistin,32,Mon Jun 29 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"Maxfund will only take animals they are pretty sure they can adopt out, they transfer the ones they can't so they can keep their ""no-kill"" name up. Dumb Friends League does not put down an animal unless the animal is suffering or they cannot safely be adopted out due to behavior.   Please research before you scare people into not taking an animal to a perfectly good shelter where this animal will either find its owner or find a new wonderful family."
Denver,3bieoe,melinyellow,3,Mon Jun 29 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Maxfund is not the best place. A friend of mine worked there for a while and tried to take them two dogs he found. They refused to take them, so he said he'd take them to Dumb Friends League instead. They told him not to take them there because it was a kill shelter. He told them he didn't have room to keep them until he could find another no-kill shelter to take them to. They ended up taking the dogs but firing him, accusing him of harassing them, and threatening to call the police if he ever went back there."
Denver,3bieoe,NeverNo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:57:40 2015 UTC,It sounds like...there's more to this story.
Denver,3bieoe,jakonrad,12,Wed Jul 1 02:42:14 2015 UTC,"It'd be really cool if folks could do a little research before saying stuff like this as if it's fact.  I volunteer at the Dumb Friends League and as far as I know, our policies are roughly the same as MaxFund when it comes to euthanizing animals.  Unless the animal has an extreme medical or psychological condition, the shelters will do everything they can to get the animal in shape to be adoptable.  The DFL does not have any sort of time limit or space limitations."
Denver,3bieoe,black_pepper,31,Mon Jun 29 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"This ""no kill vs traditional shelter"" misconception needs to go away.  Here's some info for those who are interested:  TL;DR:  All shelters are trying to do what's best for the animals, it's not going to matter which one you take the dog to.  Just because a shelter is labeled as ""no kill"" doesn't mean that they won't put an animal down, the label is misleading and undefined.  What it really means is that it's up to the shelter what they decide to put down or not.  Also, since they generally choose not to put an animal down that is sick and in pain, they will refuse to take it in, leaving the relinquisher with no choice but to take it to a municipal shelter that will do what's in the best interest of the animal, if they can treat it, they will, if they can't and the animal is in pain or a danger to people or other animals ,then it will likely be put down.  Shelters that don't label themselves as ""no kill"" are simply trying to do what's best for the animals in the community.  They do this by not restricting what comes in and ultimately, doing what's best for the animals.  I'm fairly certain that there are not shelters in Colorado that euthanize for time and space, I know there are none in the metro area."
Denver,3bieoe,jakonrad,17,Mon Jun 29 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I'd heard of Dumb Friends not being a no kill. Then I went to their website and saw a similar statement to your post:   At the end of  fiscal year 2014 (July 1, 2014), our live release rate was 88 percent,  and above 90 percent for more than the last half of the year.   ...   We are often asked: ""Are you a no-kill shelter?"" The answer is that no  we are not, for two primary reasons. While we don't euthanize healthy  animals, we object to the ""no-kill"" label, because it divides shelters  and people that need to work together to focus on what matters, which is  saving as many pets' lives as possible.   ...   Second, many ""no-kill"" shelters limit their admission of animals—either  by the number of animals allowed into the shelter or by age, health or  temperament. At the Dumb Friends League, we turn no animals away; we're  committed to serving as a compassionate safety net for all pets and all people at all times.    But then Maxfund states:   MaxFund is a true no kill animal shelter and adoption center that challenges the traditional methods of animal sheltering by leading the no kill movement in Colorado. We strive to give animals, including the injured, abandoned, and abused, a ""second chance at life.""   It sounds like Maxfund won't turn animals away so whats going on with these two different philosophies? Or is Maxfund's statement a bit misleading?"
Denver,3bieoe,DeviatedNorm,12,Mon Jun 29 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Good points.  Notice that the Maxfund statement never says that they won't turn an animal away.  I'm certain that if they have the availability then they will take everything in, but if they're full (like in the summer) and have nowhere to put an animal then they have no choice but to not take it in.  They don't have the network of shelters like /u/DeviatedNorm mentioned below that the other shelters that are a part of the Metro Denver Animal Welfare Alliance have."
Denver,3bieoe,black_pepper,8,Mon Jun 29 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"At the base of this pdf they do state they accept all animals unless they're at capacity.

Fed it for a while, thinking its owners were just letting it outside. Asked all my neighbors. They said it had always been an outdoor cat and was just always around. Nobody else wanted to take it in and I was moving to Denver so I didn't want to just leave it to its own devices. I ended up calling MaxFund and they said they wouldn't take it. Ended up taking it to Foothills but followed up and some nice lady adopted her."
Denver,3bieoe,lindygrey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:28:01 2015 UTC,maxfund didnt let us adopt a dog because we mentioned our cat went outside once or twice.
Denver,3bieoe,lindygrey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"they will refuse to take it in, leaving the relinquisher with no choice but to take it to a municipal shelter    Or, they could, god forbid, keep the animal they took responsibility for. It's been done before. Even people who have a kid who's allergic, move, get a new job, etc. manage to keep their pets till they pass on. It can be done."
Denver,3bieoe,talones,6,Mon Jun 29 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"Why put the dog through the trauma of going into a shelter, being deemed unadoptable, then being put down by a stranger in a strange place?   If they won't take it because it's unadoptable and you can't care for it anymore man up and put your own dog to sleep in the arms of someone it knows and trusts.   I might be biased as I am the intake coordinator for a rescue and I get phone calls from people trying to ""find a new home"" for elderly, blind, deaf, incontinent, dogs with kidney and heart failure frequently. They just don't want to make the obviously difficult decision to put down an animal they're tired of cleaning up after. When I explain that we'd put their dog down they accuse me of being a cold hearted animal or on a power trip. Then they ask when I can come get the dog.   I have no problem with people who truly fall on hard times and can't care for their animal anymore. That's why I do what I do. But all too often the problem is that people jumped into animal ownership without considering that animals are not little robots and they make messes, ruin carpet, fight with each other, get sick, break legs, and have a million other problems. Then the cuteness wears off and they call me to clean up their mess."
Denver,3bieoe,rwh151,3,Mon Jun 29 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"Maxfund wont take all animals, also they will only adopt out if you pass their psychological tests."
Denver,3bieoe,daydreams356,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:35:25 2015 UTC,Take her to South Platte Humane society. They are a no kill and they do very good work. Here is the website. They are very close to your location. https://hsspv.org/
Denver,3bieoe,daydreams356,2,Mon Jun 29 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"Please dont assume the dog doesnt have an owner. I've seen so many people lose animals because people like you just give them away. The dog is likely not abused... just scared. My dog, if lost, would seem like she was beat every day of her life when she is the happiest and most spoiled dog ever. I also think its illegal to not try to find an owner for a certain period of time. If she jumped in your truck, she obviously belongs or belonged to someone. Strays who have been strays for a long period of time do not do this.  Please give the animal to a NO-KILL animal shelter and contact craigslist and missing pet connection websites. Again, do NOT give her to an ""interested friend."" Give her to the shelter and say she was a lost pet. Give them your info and say you have someone interested in adoption if they cant find the owner. They wont put the dog down or adopt it out without contacting you first. How would you feel if your dogs escaped and they were just given away? She has a friggen collar for pete's sake."
Denver,3bieoe,DeviatedNorm,6,Tue Jun 30 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"She was filthy, covered in fleas, and her collar was ripped to shreds with barely any tags left on it. The vet I took her to today said it looked like she hadn't been cared for in awhile. She isn't used to being picked up, she flinches at every sudden movement and sound, and hasnt gone to the bathroom since I found her 18 hours ago.  I know what I'm doing. I posted on Facebook, reddit, and filed a Found Dog report with the DDFL. Chill out.   EDIT- and what makes you think I'm interested in adopting? I don't have the resources or space to house another animal permanently. Your whole post is based on assumptions."
Denver,3bieoe,daydreams356,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think you took my post a little more aggressive than you should have. I didn't say you were interested in adopting. You said you had someone interested. If that person, or another, wants the dog then they can have them in a week when no owner was found.  You really think that a dog couldnt have gotten lost say a few weeks or a month ago and been lost, scared, confused? With fleas... dirty... scared? I've HAD it happen. I've had friend have it happen. One of my friends found HER chihuahua at the park with another owner. This -same- situation had happened. The dog is confused and scared... just as any would have been at getting lost. Most people don't abandon their dog with a collar on... FYI."
Denver,3bieoe,Sne4kyWomb4t,2,Mon Jun 29 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"I feel at this point I've done all I can for her. Don't expect much to come from that Found Dog report though. DFL is closer to my house but MaxFund is also an option. DFL won't take strays, they just transfer them to Denver City Shelter and I really don't trust them over there (they're city workers!)"
Denver,3bieoe,brijjen,3,Mon Jun 29 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"I posted a link to Denver City Shelter's numbers elsewhere in this thread, but overall of the nearly 5000 dogs they took in last year they only euthanized 10%.  And this is a the place that takes them when absolutely no one else will, but still only 10%.  Because they only euthanize those who are truly beyond hope anyway."
Denver,3bieoe,sweatyjockstrap,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"But they also have a list of dogs that are lost. If this dog was lost 6 months ago, years ago even... they could help find the owner. Maxfund is fine and no-kill too."

We have three acres, we're semi retired, have plenty of love and room and I am willing to accept her with the understanding that I reserve the option of Maxfund (or like) if she just can't fit in with the current bitches (I think she'd be fine)."

Denver,3bieoe,velamar,-7,Mon Jun 29 14:41:25 2015 UTC,I used to volunteer at Maxfund and loved them. They are a no-kill shelter. Dumb Friends league will put animals down. :-( The municipal shelters are high-kill places.
Denver,3bieoe,ashtonias,12,Mon Jun 29 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"Last year the Metro Denver Shelter Alliance (which Denver Dumb Friends League is part of) placed 89% of all animals entering their system.  Unlike Max Fund, they don't turn away any animals, they accept them all -- and that 10%?  Those are unhealthy and untreatable animals.  DDFL's figures aren't loading for me but last year, Denver Shelter, who is also part of the shelter alliance, had zero animals who were healthy for adoption were euthanized.  Compare these kinds of numbers to a national shelter where regularly 30% of dogs and 40% of cats are euthanized, I'm left wondering why you're running around making the claims you are."
Denver,3bieoe,farttornado58,3,Mon Jun 29 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"I'm betting the reason for the claims are really because the words ""no kill"" have a lot of emotion behind them.  People just blindly follow those words without knowing what they really mean or what all of the other shelters are trying to do for the animals.  I also think it's worth stating that Maxfund is not a part of the Metro Denver Shelter Alliance (now Metro Denver Animal Welfare Alliance)."

And yes to back up OP, I've definitely had evenings ruined thanks to horrible parenting, or parents who don't understand that their kids can't/shouldn't run around a restaurant, scream, knock shit over or touch people's food. When I complained I was informed it was a family friendly environment. And then I asked if I could go up to their table and take items off their plates because it's family friendly and somewhere, somehow, I too have a family. Got a snide remark from the waitress and told the manager that he shouldn't be alienating people that buy cocktails and spend a lot on food whereas they've got a table of waters, kids menu items and no booze causing a ton of trouble for a table top who's paying 3x as much for a meal despite having half the people."

It could be a group of parents who just want to be away from kids/underage people having a good night out like old times.  We all know there are parents who want to get a way from their kids from time to time, why assume there are not people who want to be away from theirs as well 100% of the time?   Maybe this is a group that can't be 100 feet from people under 18. The hate is strong, wow."

See how when you change it into anything other than children and use any other generalization, it sounds selfish, entitled, and just kind of gross?

It's not exactly what you want, but Namiko's Japanese restaurant in Arvada separates kids from adults pretty well. Families with kids are put in the ""kids section"" and adults, particularly adults in pairs, are seated on the other side of the restaurant.  Dave & Buster's restaurants have curfews where they kick out anyone under 18 or 21 (it varies) at a particular time (which also varies). That's fine if you want to be out at 11p... doesn't do it for me.  I don't remember a lot of young kids in the Larimer Square area.

God forbid a child get excited by something they're seeing for the first time. If you're 30 or whatever, you've seen a thousand dinosaurs. Sorry that you're jaded by life.

Most are just tired of having to defend their life choices. They're sick of the snide comments. Women are sick of people acting like their only purpose in life is to be an incubator.

When you're part of a society, you agree to the laws of that society as well as to pay your portion of the infrastructure, including things one may not directly use themselves. Libertarians have no concept of societal responsibility.  I could go on, but suffice it to say the stereotype isn't off. Libertarians are undereducated morons who all have bought into this idea that ""if the government just were to stop taxing me and get out of my way, I'd be rich"", despite history, economics, and reality disagreeing.

The Fed enables private profits for the few while they dump heir losses on the public.  I'd read more on Austrian economics to better understand free market economics.

Denver,3bi7ar,GringodelRio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"So, I wrote a nice well cited response to this but in true Reddit fashion I hit the wrong button and deleted it all. Now you get the abridged version.   Socialism, which is what the Nordic nations have, works well   I have seen this claim made more and more by Progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters and the blunt reality is that it is not true. The Nordic nations with the exception of Sweden (and that's changing) are all inseparable members of the NATO and EU alliances. As a result, the defensive, economic, and social burdens of these nations is a pittance to those of the US. The Nordic nations are quite small when compared to the USA; not only are the populations of these nations a fraction of the US population but the economic prowess and impact on the world stage is also minuscule in comparison. It is impotent to remember how a key facet and defining trait of the Nordic nations is their rigorously selective immigration and border control process. The difficulty of gaining visa and citizenship, or even physical access to these nations is a laborious process. Conversely American progressives will presently scream murder every time the US tries to enforce the existing boarder and immigration laws by deporting illegal immigrants and maintaining strict border security. There is much more but in short, to claim that the US can manage its economy, population, and gov. services in the same way as the 'Nordic nations' is patently absurd and ignores the very difficult and complicated realities confronting America.  The truth is that socialism does not work. Not even “Democratic Socialism” which I believe to be a misnomer. If it did, we would see evidence that it does everywhere. Instead, I can point to countless failed states and regimes the world over that produced poverty, hunger, and despair to much greater extremes then the callous nature of capitalism ever could.  When I see the blind bandwagon support for people like Sanders I fear that the American population has become so far removed from the tragedy of Communism that they have forgotten what it actually looks like.

Denver,3bhluy,talones,7,Mon Jun 29 14:23:29 2015 UTC,It's almost like TV isn't an accurate indicator of what people can do in real life.
Denver,3bhluy,4Sammich,10,Mon Jun 29 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"That's kind of a silly comparison.  They should use more restraint as they should be trained to more accurately assess danger and more controlably handle the situation.  To use another silly comparison, a professional model will show more restraint with a box of free donuts than your average lard-ass American."
Denver,3bhluy,tartay745,-5,Mon Jun 29 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"Of course they are supposed to show more restraint, and they usually do the vast majority of the time.   Lets hear some more fat American comments though, because that is sure enlightening and poignant."
Denver,3bhluy,SteelChicken,4,Mon Jun 29 14:00:04 2015 UTC,It's accurate and the comparison makes sense and is relevant...
Denver,3bhluy,subfluous,-9,Mon Jun 29 16:11:13 2015 UTC,Its a silly comparison.  But when 70% of Americans are overweight its also accurate.  Your average American is overweight and probably not going to do a great job turning down a delicable pastry filled with sugar.
Denver,3bhluy,tartay745,7,Mon Jun 29 14:21:28 2015 UTC,And it also has nothing to do with this discussion
Denver,3bhluy,scuba7183,0,Mon Jun 29 14:48:42 2015 UTC,A comparison isn't supposed to directly relate to a topic. Its supposed to make the topic at hand more digestable and easily understood.  I responded to the guy who complained about my comparison by justifying its use.  Most people dont have to worry about using a firearm in daily life so its harder to conceptualize than turning down a donut.  Using justifiable force is part of a cops job just as staying thin is part of a model's.
Denver,3bhluy,tartay745,3,Mon Jun 29 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"if you put ordinary people in these kinds of situations, they are more likely to shoot than most police officers   ::golf clap::   I'm glad the people who's job it is to fight crime and manage volatile situations have more restraint than people off the street. Is that supposed to be laudable? Because it seems like it would be requisite for performing the duties inherent to the job.   That story is an anecdote about the Maricopa Sheriff's department, one of the most infamously corrupt in the country, bringing in ONE CIVILIAN to mitigate that civilians criticism of the department. Holy shit, I can't imagine anything more self serving.  'oh boy was I wrong their job is WAY harder than I thought' says the ""progressive"" ""activist"" pastor with zero law enforcement or force escalation training.

Denver,3bhluy,yeradolt,4,Mon Jun 29 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it IS laudable, because it is EXTREMELY difficult.  You of course along with most other ordinary people have no idea because you have had no actual training or experiences with these types of situations, yet still feel completely enabled to offer expert opinions.    The article points out how easy it is to judge without going through the situations yourself.  Once that is done, eyes are opened very, very quickly."

Denver,3bi2hj,mikmeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"I would love to know honest answers as to why this is better than Gigabit from CenturyLink, Google, etc (besides availability at a certain property). To me, it is all marketing. What consumer grade edge devices have 10Gbps ports that can push enough PPS? At least CenturyLink and Google will provide TV service over the fiber and actually utilize it.  Comcast is thinking that their customers are dumb enough to see 2Gbps and think hey, that's better than CenturyLink at only 1Gbps. Then the customer puts a 100Mbps Linksys router and runs all of their devices over wifi anyway. Comcast gets $300 a month from a customer that would have only been paying $70/month before."
Denver,3bi2hj,two-dollars,0,Wed Jul 1 15:10:30 2015 UTC,2Gbps sounds a little suspect given there aren't any 2Gbps NIC. You generally go from 1Gbps to 10Gbps Ethernet or you can do 8Gbps Fiber which is expensive. I suppose if you had 2 Gbps into the house which they'd have to put in equipment that'd mean that if you have 2x 1Gbps NIC they can saturation both fully and make use of it. Still seems like they're bullshitting.
Denver,3bi2hj,bigtexatx,3,Tue Jun 30 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see how ""there aren't any 2 Gbps NICs"" is relevant. Comcast could easily use 10 GbE if they wanted, and limit it to 2 Gbps.  Also, this is FTTH, so by definition they're going to be using fiber."

Denver,3bjdz8,Chaen,12,Mon Jun 29 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"You can keep an eye on river flows using USGS gauges or American Whitewater.    https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/state-summary/state/CO/  When it comes to tubing you'll want to stick with rivers that are class 1's or maybe 2's if you want some excitement.  Definitely wear a life-jacket, preferably one made for rivers.    Outside of Denver there are a lot of great stretches but this year the water has been high so you have to drive a bit to find some calmer water. Last weekend I floated the Yampa River just outside the town of Craig and it was wonderful.  The water was moving but the size of the river made things manageable.  There's a 3.5 miles stretch starting at the Golf Course maintenance shed and taking out at Loudy Simpson park.  You can extend this to about 12-13 miles by alternating put-ins.   I have not floated any other part of the Yamp but I understand that almost the entire stretch from Steamboat through the Little Yampa canyon is class 1-2.  There are some LONELY stretches that are to long for tubing so do your homework.  The stretch I mention above took us about 45 minutes to do and running a shuttle back and forth was easy.    The Gunnison from just North of Town (Garlic Mikes) to McCabes lane including the whitewater park is beautiful. Its COLD - but a nice float.  The flows have calmed down there too. You can also play in the whitewater park there.  You can learn in a relatively safe way why I say you'll probably want to stick to Class 1-2's.  The Gunnison white water park is manufactured Class 3's - and they are challenging to float and stay upright.    I've always wanted to tube the Rio Grande from Wagon Wheel gap down to one of the many takes outs.  It looks pretty class 1-2 and it's in a beautiful valley. The flow looks decent (not too big) right now.    You can tube stretches of the Colorado through Palisade/Grand Junction and that water has also calmed down but you'll need to research put-in's.  There's actually an outfitter that used to run commercial trips on one of these stretches but I don't know if they still run anything. You can also float out of Grand Junction where the Colorado floats along I-70 and take out at Loma.   The waters are starting to subside, especially on the western slope and right now would be a great time to do some tubing.  Try to note where you go, what the flow is like and about how long it takes you to float a stretch. If you share it with me I'll share a spreadsheet I've been keeping for about 10 years with the same information.   (In fact, if anyone here would like to start a shared spreadsheet I'll be happy to provide what I have.  PM me.)  Good luck and be safe."

Denver,3blcgy,v-porphyria,9,Wed Jul 1 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"We're a one-car household of two people and here's the things that make it work:   Bikes with a cargo rack and panier bags.  Backpacks suck biking, your back gets hot and sweaty and the weight throws off pedaling; cargo racks make everything so much better.  Also, buy an expensive $50.00+ bike lock.  Bike theft is an issue. RTD Ticket Books.  If you can't get reduced monthly passes through work, it's cheaper to buy the ticket books with RTD.  To make the monthly pass work out to being cheaper, you will need to ride RTD for at least 20 days a month and we found that with biking most days we were not anywhere near that amount. Car Sharing service. Check out Car2Go, Zipcar, etc. Uber, Lyft, Taxi Services.  Taking a taxi services once and awhile is still much-much cheaper than owning a car.  Just the monthly cost of insurance for a car usually equals several Uber rides per month. Combine services.  Bike to the bus stop, put the bike on the bus's bike rack, ride the bus to where you need to go, take your bike off the rack and bike the remaining distance.  Car Rental.  If you find that you feel trapped in Denver and want to get away, renting a car on the weekend is often a good deal. Car Rental companies typically have unlimited mile packages for the weekend that are quite cheap.  There are always coupons online.  We have one car, but we often do this when we travel/fly to other locations. Bike routes are not the same routes that you will drive.  Almost always the fastest route for a bike is different than the automobile route.  Check out http://www.denvergov.org/Portals/708/documents/BIKE_MAP_FINAL-web.pdf I see new bikers in Denver on very dangerous roads and I lament that they are usually only one or two streets away from a much safer marked bike route.  Learn the bike routes and try to stay off the busy streets.  The slow-driving side streets are awesome for biking."

The 15 (Chambers) drops you off right in front of building 500. The 20 also stops there, and it goes to union station. There are also buses to Boulder which your eco pass covers, so if you feel like getting out of Denver, it's free.   It's a great deal."

Denver,3bjeg8,rberg303,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:16:44 2015 UTC,I just saw him. Sat in old town arvada. Some older lady was debating with him.
Denver,3bjeg8,bigrodey77,3,Tue Jun 30 02:29:44 2015 UTC,I bet he was waiting for the fountains.

Denver,3bjeg8,Kongbuck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"Every village has its crazy guy. He's ours. I've overheard him spouting off his life views and political outlooks and it boils down to, ""Police oppress us because the President tells them to"" and ""The Illuminati receive their marching orders from Cthulu""."

Denver,3bjeg8,Fofolito,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Wait. Does this guy use RTD? Only ask because I was on the 92 about a month or two back, and I had a very similar 'conversation', if you could call it that. Guy got off somewhere in old Thornton, but damn, if it wasn't conspiracy out the ass. The worst part was that everyone was trying to ignore him, but he was yelling how the campscwere coming, police oppression, Obama, etc etc.   Told him to seek professional help as he got off."
Denver,3bjeg8,4Sammich,3,Mon Jun 29 21:09:19 2015 UTC,I've never been fortunate enough to have him on board my bus but I've certainly heard him yelling at passers-by at Colfax & Broadway enough times to be familiar with his platform.
Denver,3bjeg8,Krona74,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:11:45 2015 UTC,Likely. He lives somewhere up in Westminster/Federal Heights area.
