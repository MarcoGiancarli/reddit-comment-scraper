AlienBlue,3e4myk,HelloGoodbyeBlueSky,3,Tue Jul 21 23:15:03 2015 UTC,I have pro and I see ads.
AlienBlue,3e4myk,Mattallica,4,Tue Jul 21 23:34:56 2015 UTC,iPhone or iPad?
AlienBlue,3e4myk,fs454,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"I have Pro and see ads too on iPhone. I've switched to the app amrc as of late. It's waaaaaaaaay faster as well.   I've been a huge fan of AB since the beginning, but the lack of support bolstered by even further lack of support once Reddit acquired it, and ads on Pro was enough to finally push me over to a new app. It's been real, I guess."

AlienBlue,3e4myk,Mattallica,4,Tue Jul 21 22:54:44 2015 UTC,Weird.  After I refreshed the front page I didn't see it after that. Maybe it was a fluke?
AlienBlue,3e4myk,TheBoozehammer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:55:21 2015 UTC,Can you go to the main overview page that shows your list of subs and scroll to the top and see if there's a blue medallion in the top center of the screen?  It would be right here
AlienBlue,3e4myk,VitaminH,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:16 2015 UTC,I have pro and have never seen one myself. Looks like some kind of bug.
AlienBlue,3e4myk,Seyloren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:22:23 2015 UTC,If you have reddit gold they won't show up.

AlienBlue,3e4ptz,puttyarrowbro,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:51 2015 UTC,Not from alien blue. Probably some delayed ad or something from a another link you clicked on.

AlienBlue,3e1qfs,xelandria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:48:10 2015 UTC,Subscribing and unsubscribing doesn't sync between the app and the desktop. What is subscribed to on desktop must be u subscribed to via the desktop--this rings true for the defaults that you were automatically subscribed to on the desktop when you started your account.
AlienBlue,3e2aaj,The_Peter_Pan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:01 2015 UTC,Way more helpful if you provide the link to the actual post. There's not much of anything to be learned from just this image.

AlienBlue,3e0n38,alien_screw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"It's been happening since before the last update.  What's happening is when you pull down to enlarge the image, it's pulling down the posts in the background as well just like you would to refresh when not previewing.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but a way to ensure this doesn't happen is to pull the preview back up to the top before releasing."

AlienBlue,3dz2rq,burkamus,12,Mon Jul 20 18:20:15 2015 UTC,Is that not the recommended app ? A new feature in ios9.  You must use the app a lot and at particular time and/or location and so it's suggesting it to you.   It's not something wrong with the app or the beta
AlienBlue,3dz2rq,garyomario,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, there's not supposed to be a recommended app in the multitasking.  Maybe there is, and I just haven't seen that before.  I do normally check AB in the mornings, before I leave for work, so maybe it is.

AlienBlue,3dz2rq,garyomario,9,Mon Jul 20 18:55:02 2015 UTC,In pretty sure there is. When I get into my car and plug in my phone it recommends overcast etc
AlienBlue,3dz2rq,fullinator4,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is an Alien Blue issue since I've seen this with Spotify a couple of times. Report it to Apple through the feedback app.
AlienBlue,3dz2rq,garyomario,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:03 2015 UTC,I have.  I'm almost 100% convinced that it's an iOS 9 issue since I'm (obviously) using a beta.  But I wasn't sure if others were seeing the same thing.  And this is the first time I've ever seen the Good Morning/Afternoon screen at all.
AlienBlue,3dz2rq,garyomario,3,Mon Jul 20 18:38:59 2015 UTC,Is that not the recommended app ? So you use it in the morning so it's suggesting it to you in the morning   Edit : afternoon not morning but you get my point

AlienBlue,3dsjrg,TheRealMeatMan,3,Sun Jul 19 01:16:41 2015 UTC,Open in safari.
AlienBlue,3dsjrg,AnEmortalKid,2,Sun Jul 19 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"That works but doesn't fix the problem. Maybe have a separate ""show links"" page that is easier to click? Similar to how they do the ""show table"" function."
AlienBlue,3duljq,Riddance,5,Sun Jul 19 17:04:30 2015 UTC,Like this?
AlienBlue,3duljq,Jpasholk,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't get to that menu  I just found where I can open it in safari though. There's a share option too I'm messing with it. There's no easy just 'copy link' button in this"
AlienBlue,3duljq,Jpasholk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:41 2015 UTC,When you're viewing the link in AB you can hit the copy button in the sharesheet and it will copy the link in question. If you do it while viewing the reddit thread it will copy the link to that thread. Alien Blue isn't very intuitive. Comet will be out soon enough so just bide you time. :)

AlienBlue,3duljq,Jpasholk,2,Mon Jul 20 12:17:35 2015 UTC,Can't tell if sarcastic or I helped you...  http://imgur.com/mNeV0TK
AlienBlue,3duljq,JackHaal,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"you literally wrote like the same reply to a comment of mine on /r/AlienBlue, so I decided to do it to you :p"
AlienBlue,3duljq,Jpasholk,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:16 2015 UTC,Really? Fuck I'm getting old I don't remember. Haha.
AlienBlue,3duljq,JackHaal,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Don’t worry, you’re still awesome"
