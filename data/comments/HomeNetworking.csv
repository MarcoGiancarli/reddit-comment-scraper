If it's showing no abnormal traffic with no devices connected, and then you power them back on in sequence, that's gonna tell you where to look further. If you see the abnormal traffic with no devices connected, then it's an issue with the router. Is there any steady traffic inbound?

What you gain from multicast aware layer 2 devices is not the ability to carry multicast, but the ability to ""prune"" multicast.  Without the pruning support, all devices will just flood multicast around as if it were broadcast traffic.  All devices should do this.  The catch is that this multicast traffic goes out every port and every AP that is connected, so it can be very wasteful of bandwidth depending on your setup.  If you're trying to do it between LAN and WAN, then yes you'll need multicast routing support."

HomeNetworking,3e2xme,dokumentamarble,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"Here is an example. You are on Reddit right now, did you have to do anything to your router to get to Reddit from your home? Probably not. That is because it is an outgoing request. Computer --> Router --> Internet --> Reddit Server  However, most routers block incoming connections. So if you hosted Reddit at your house then people would get to your router but not be able to get past that. Unless you setup port forwarding on your router. If you have 3 servers in your house, how does the router know which one to port forward to? It doesn't, which is why you have to give it the ip of the device to port forward to when you setup port forwarding in your router.   So getting back to you being able to access Reddit from your home, I am also able to access Reddit from my home (without port forwarding) and we are able to communicate to each other here. So think about your phone being me, you being your thermostat, and Reddit being the Manufacturers website API. We can communicate with each other without having to setup any port forwarding.   The middle man isn't connecting to your home, you are connecting to the middle man. That is the big difference."

HomeNetworking,3e2xme,jdblaich,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:57:50 2015 UTC,Port forwarding is not a difficult task.  You tell the router that you want anything coming in on a certain port to go to a specific IP/mac address.  That's pretty much it.  You just have to know the IP/mac address of the device and the port that it uses.  Neither of those are difficult to obtain.  The IP/mac address are likely determined easily with the router.  The port would be more difficult. Either it should be documented in the booklet you get or available from the manufacturer.  Then there's a google search that you can do if you can't get it any other way as others probably have tried the same thing.

HomeNetworking,3e1n1v,pixpop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"You can run them from a command prompt in Windows, or a terminal in OS X. The syntax is roughly the same across the two:  ping IPADDRESS  Where you replace IPADDRESS with the IP you want to ping. You can also use a domain or hostname (such as google.com), but first off it's probably easiest to ping the IP address of your router to test LAN connectivity, or google.com to test WAN (internet) connectivity.  On Windows, the above command will only send 4 pings which isn't great for troubleshooting intermittent faults, so if you do:  ping IPADDRESS -t  it'll keep pinging until you tell it to stop, which you can do by pressing ctrl+c  tracert works in a very similar way, syntax-wise. What that does is detail each ""hop"" (point where your packets are routed) between your computer, and the destination IP or name you enter after 'tracert.' You enter it in the same format, eg:  tracert google.com  Or for OS X, you'd use traceroute instead or tracert, but it works the same. There's no real point running a tracert to your router as it's just a single hop, and a ping achieves the same thing by either showing whether the connection is up or down. But running a tracert to someone like Google (which you can safely assume will be up, basically no matter what) will show you where along the chain packets are being dropped. Might be an ISP issue, but it's doubtful the issue will lie outside your own LAN imo."

If your devices support 5ghz, that may give you more channels to work with to avoid interference issues. If the signal is low, you'll want to move the devices or APs closer together. The other way to test to make sure there isn't any configuration or equipment issue is to move one of the problem devices next to the AP and see if it drops.

I'm pretty firmly convinced that these are configuration issues - and the fact that both the printer and the camera seem to be so cheaply made are likely at the root of the issues."
HomeNetworking,3dyrlv,Meercat22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"A ""router"" is more complex than simply enabling wireless access. If you want a single LAN, you could use a secondary router but you'd want to put it in access point mode (which basically involves turning off DHCP and only using the LAN ports on the back, not the WAN port). Or you could just buy a dedicated access point, something like a [Unifi}(https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap/) which is very capable.  When you say you have coax access in both office and house, are those both dedicated lines to your ISP, or could they be used as a connection between the two locations? You basically need a wired connection from the location of the main router, to the location of the access point. Coax could work for this using MOCA adaptors, but ideally you'd run ethernet between the two locations."

HomeNetworking,3dyrlv,fdjsakl,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"If there is coax run between the house and the garage, you can use moca adapters to extend your network.   Then just put another wireless AP in your garage/office.    If the coax doesn't run from the house to the garage, then you might want to look into a wireless bridging kit, which is basically 2 outdoor antennas pointed at each other and connected to access points."
HomeNetworking,3dyrlv,ThePegasi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I think I'll try a wireless bridging kit.
HomeNetworking,3dyrlv,matthaios637,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"That's not really going to work for a single LAN, unfortunately. For optimum performance, you'll need to run a cable between the two locations (preferably Cat6) to enable a secondary access point at the location where the router isn't. You could also consider Powerline (which runs ethernet over mains power) as long as there's one continuous circuit between the two locations, though this isn't ideal as it's a rather severe speed bottleneck."
HomeNetworking,3dyi8e,joetag15,3,Mon Jul 20 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the Unifi APs over the Open-Mesh stuff. The Open-Mesh equipment is more for extending and creating a mesh network. It will do what you want, but that isn't it's main purpose. If you have network drops everywhere you want to put an AP, the Unifi AP is the way to go. Only other thing to consider is which model. If you don't need 5ghz you can go with the base model or LR. If there is a lot of interferance on 2.4ghz, you will need to go with the Pro."
HomeNetworking,3dyi8e,matthaios637,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:09 2015 UTC,You mentioned using POE but where are your network drops? I would assume they're wall plates and not ceiling mounts which I might add what the UAPs are and if they are wall plates then you'll have power right there though if you want to go fancy and still use POE then there are a few wall mount solutions which will fit your bill.   You could likely get away with two APs configured in a way to cover your most likely areas of use. I have a setup with one AP on the top floor and one in the basement using EdiMax Pro WAP1750 which includes central control and better roaming. I'm interested solely in AC devices and am not impressed with the UAP-AC nor do I like their pricing at the moment (due mostly to the dollar weakness).   This Open Mesh stuff looks interesting..

Adding another router to the mix, connected through the same crappy wireless, will only complicate your network more and make it slower. You will also be behind a double NAT as well.   It really depends on where the issue with the connection is. If its an issue with the router, the first step would be to change the router. Adding additional equipment behind a router that can't handle the traffic won't make anything better, because the bottleneck at the main router will still exist.  If its an issue with the wireless, you can change the router for something with better wireless, or you can connect some wireless access points. Wireless APs would be ideal because you can have multiple running in different areas for better coverage. Obviously in this case you would have to run wires.  If wires aren't an option, you can look in to ethernet over powerline, or something I am currently using to extend my network to my wife's Grandma's down the street is use a wireless point to point bridge. I am using two Ubiquiti Nanostations, and I have another small router at the other end. These work better than regular consumer wireless routers and similar options because they can natively bridge, and they have a more focused signal. I wouldn't recommend using a router at the other end unless you are going to be using higher end routers on both ends to properly setup your routing though. Otherwise you will be behind a two NATs.  The last option would be to look in to a wireless mesh system like open-mesh. I haven't tried them, only read reviews. Main issue with this is that you degrade your connection with every hop, but it will effectively extend the range of your wireless connection.  In any case, I don't recommend a second router as it will cause more issues even if it ""works."""
HomeNetworking,3dwu1l,matthaios637,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:13:48 2015 UTC,"I was planning on turning the first router into a glorified modem with my router being the actual NAT/DHCP server, and the third router with DHCP/NAT turned off and have it just be an AP.   However, now that I see now details regarding isolating the networking the now sketched I am. I want to (and already do) delve into some r/homeserver stuff and don't want to be 'hacked'.  I have a month to learn more networking before I move in, is there a way to separate the networks with an EdgeRouter Lite? First router as a modem with everything else turned off, second one the DHCP/NAT server, and the third one an AP for its dualband wifi.

HomeNetworking,3dwu1l,herpderp020,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:12 2015 UTC,You can definitely separate the networks with the edge router using VLANS. Each customer can get their own vlan which is their own network. If you want people to be able to communicate between the different networks you can add firewall rules to allow that. With VLANs you will obviously need to have all routers/switches to be 802.1q compliant unless the ports on the respective device will carry untagged traffic.

If you want to isolate yourself, yes, the edge router would be an ideal solution. It will give you the ability to vlan and subnet.   The main issue is you're wireless connection. If all the equipment is still upstairs, are you sure you will be able to connect? Also, in this scenario, your wireless is done by another router turned in to an ap. In this case, you cannot segment that network, so all your housemates are again on the same network as you. You would need another wireless router or ap, or an ap that supports VLANs."

HomeNetworking,3dwu1l,thebardingreen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"Very true. Theoretically, if I managed to run a wire downstairs and connect my cheap router to the main one and use it as an access point with a different channel than the upstairs one, that should fix my connectivity problems and make it so I can use ethernet. I'd still be on the same local network, though, which would be unfortunate.   I have never been upstairs in that building to verify if it is a router problem or a wireless problem. I am doing research well in advance to moving in. I want to have a game plan immediately when I move in in a month."
HomeNetworking,3dwu1l,thebardingreen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:45 2015 UTC,"If you can run the cable, which is definitely ideal, and you get the ERL, you can set your port on a different subnet. This would be your best case and would address all of your concerns, wireless stability near your room, secure from the other users on the network, and a fast wired connection in your room.  With this setup though, there is some configuration on the ERL. You will have to setup firewall rules to block other subnets from access to your subnet, There are tons of options you can do, but I'd start there and then you can play with it more over time.  Now my only concern though is the wireless for the rest of the network. If you turn the main router ( I'm assuming this is an all in one unit that includes modem, router, and wireless? ), then how is the rest of the apartment going to connect to wireless? In an ideal situation from what it sounds like you would want, you should go like this...  ERL Port 1 --> WAN to modem (or gateway in your case ERL Port 2 --> Wired to your room connected to an AP, or wireless router with DHCP turned off, and connected through the LAN side, not connected to the WAN. subnet would be something like 192.168.1.0/24 ERL Port 2 --> Connected to AP for the rest of your housemates on subnet 192.168.2.0/24  On the ERL you would setup a firewall rule saying to drop any traffic from subnet a to subnet b and the opposite.  You could eventually get some Unifi APs and have multiple SSIDs on them segregated by VLAN. That would allow anyone to connect to all the APs and depending on which they connect to, they would be put in to the VLAN of either subnet A or subnet B. Most ideal, and maybe a project for further down the road, but would cost around $200+ depending on how you wired it. This should be your end goal IMO."

HOWEVER, you can still BRIDGE your connection.  If you go to the classic control panel and get to your network and sharing center, then select ""Change adapter settings"", select both your wired and wireless connections (drag a box around them or shift-select both), then press ALT on your keyboard, and select advanced, bridge.  It will take a minute but the wifi and wired connections will bridge.  How this works:  the wifi will essentially be an extension of the wired connection.  The new ""bridge"" adapter, is your local link to that bridge.  The wifi/wired connections will behave essentially how a wireless router would when you connect something to the LAN and to the WiFi, it will simply pass the connection across.  This puts your Chromecast on the LAN (not sure if this is ideal, but it should work).  The hard part is the setting up your wifi to act as an AP - which I suspect is what that ""netsh"" command was all about - the one that said ""no internet access"" - if you got that far (I assume, on the chromecast) the last leg is to ensure that you can get from the wifi connection between chromecast/PC and the internet - this is where the bridge comes in.  When it's working, connect your cellphone as the casting device (or use your chrome browser) and enjoy.  FYI: your IP address and all relevant connectivity details for the LOCAL PC will be on the ""bridge"" device."

One port will be for upstream (internet), one of each of three ports for each tenant (untagged vlans), and on the fifth port some number of access points to get coverage throughout the building. On the AP's, set up three SSID's, one for each tenant and on the same vlan as the port dedicated to that tenant (tagged vlans from the AP's).  Instead of an ERX, it might be easier to go all Ubiquiti with a USG and Unifi AP's. Maybe UAP-pros to get 5Ghz which could work better with streaming, etc if there's lots of interference on 2.4Ghz.  Also, having QoS on the router to limit each tenant's bandwidth could be useful. I forget the term where the limit would be raised if there is no other traffic to fill the remaining bandwidth, but that should be used too.  Edit: oops, a usg won't have enough ports for my plan.

HomeNetworking,3dv8ie,BetterHomeWifi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it would be better to be wired, the Unifi APs have more than enough bandwidth to support his needs. The base model supports 300Mb throughput, which is well over the bandwidth from the isp. There shouldn't really be much LAN traffic to worry about, so they won't come close to maxing out their throughput. With multiple APs, that will also further balance the load.   Wired connections should be done, but if it's not possible, I wouldn't worry about it."
HomeNetworking,3dv8ie,matthaios637,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"A Unifi AP is a dual-stream 802.11n 2.4Ghz device. To achieve 300 Mbps with a dual-stream device, 40Mhz would need to be used. This is difficult to do in 2.4Ghz (interference, etc) and only one 40Mhz channel fits in 2.4Ghz. So... Probably not likely that it will work.  So a 20Mhz channel could get 150Mbps (under ideal conditions - good signal strength, low interference, etc). But, WiFi is half-duplex, so you won't be getting all of that 150 in one direction. Plus, if any other devices are associated with that AP, they will taking up some of that bandwidth. 2.4 is very crowded, so it's likely that there will be interference, unless you are out in the sticks.  Will all of the streaming boxes be close enough to the AP to get full bandwidth? Hard to say. They might get enough to stream, but maybe not optimally.

One option to achieve this is to have TWC drop a 100mbps fiber in the basement and you can split it up with a switch and run 3 links, 1 to each property. As far as addressing goes have TWC give you a /29 (5 usable addresses) and assign each router an IP address. I am not 100% sure but I think you can have them do that as DHCP since you don't need static.  Another option would be a gateway / router in the basement, something like a m0n0wall or pfSense (my favorite). You could bring in the link from TWC and setup 3 separate interfaces, 1 for each property.  My reason for the 3 separate interfaces is kinda from a security standpoint. That way each exists as it own network and can't be ""spied on"" by the other properties. Plus with a central gateway you could enforce traffic shaping to prevent one person from wrecking all of the bandwidth for everyone else.  That's my 2 cents."

If they have computer problems of their own, they're likely to try rebooting the router in the middle of me doing something.  As a network engineer, my suggestion would be to try to get enough public IPs to have 1 for each of your rental units, and then put a standard consumer router within each rental unit.  IP routing without NAT is easily done reliably.  It is fire and forget.  If you put a modem and non-NAT router in an equipment room, it should easily be able to go YEARS between reboots.  NAT routers are where all the unreliable stuff happens.  They have to remember every connection that is happening through them (compared to a normal router which just routes 1 packet at a time and doesn't have to remember anything about the past traffic).  One user doing something that creates too many connections in the NAT router's memory can overload it, leaving no one able to make any more connections.  This is why things like campus networks and public wifi tends to be so unreliable.  They always put a bunch of users behind a single NAT router.  In a hotel, it's not reasonable to get a public IP and router for every room, but for a 3 unit rental it is totally doable.  Residential class connections usually have stipulations that you can't share it between households.  To do this ""legally"", you'll probably need to get a business class connection.  But if you do that, getting 3-4 public IPs should also be no problem.  So, now that I've typed this whole long message, I'm thinking anything you do with sharing is going to be significantly more expensive than just getting 3 individual connections from Time Warner.  I strongly suspect that the cheapest business plan will be more expensive than the 3 residential plans."

If they have computer problems of their own, they're likely to try rebooting the router in the middle of me doing something.   That's an excellent point that I had not considered.   I'm definitely thinking that I need a small business rather than residential plan if I'm going to share a connection, and that may well be more expensive than 3 individual plans, which would also be by far the easiest to set up and maintain."

The issue is not with NOT, but more with the hardware it is running on.  Even then it's still more likely the computer then the router."
HomeNetworking,3dv8ie,BetterHomeWifi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, consumer routers are generally pretty questionable hardware, though I seem to have had pretty good luck there.  However, from a software standpoint, there is a huge reliability loss on anything that tracks connections.  As soon as you start tracking connections, it becomes fairly trivial to fill your connection tracking table and then you can't make any new connections.  Many of the people I've seen running into router problems have simply filled their connection table, especially when that router has a higher than average number of computers/users behind it.  My suggestion is that this common failure domain should be pushed down to a per-client basis and should not be a single failure domain for the entire group of rental units.  In my network engineering career, I've focused very much on routing and switching and generally tried to avoid being responsible for connection tracking devices.  Connection tracking devices are always much more unreliable than quality non-tracking routers and switches.  I like being responsible for things that can be made reliable.  :)"

The memory to keep the table is not much, the lookup time is miniscule, and no real Processing power needed.  Nothing to cause issues with the router.  It was never meant for big corporations, and if all ports are being used without any expiring to ""fill up the table"" then there is an issue with the design.  For just 3 rooms, a NAT would be nothing.Each room would need to have 21000 connections with no reuse of socket to fill up the table.  Suggesting 3 IP's is not fiscully efficient because there is no need for external computers to connect back to those apartment.    Edit:  My suggestion is use a NAT with the inside being 3 subnet's, once for each spot.  An individual access point for each would not be a bad Idea, but paying for a /29 public would be more cost then needed."
HomeNetworking,3dv8ie,BetterHomeWifi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"I have a bunch of routers here that had dd-wrt installed on them.  I just checked several of them, and they default to having a max table size of 4096.  It can be configured higher, but I'm not sure how high is safe.  If Linux attempts to create a NAT entry and there is no available RAM, it kernel panics and locks up.  So, you have to be careful how high you go here.  I checked some normal Linux systems, and they all seem to default to a max table size of 15828.  I checked some DD-WRT systems, and they seem to default to 4096.  The real problem, though, comes with broken, hacked, or otherwise misbehaving computers.  The default NAT table timeout on SYN_SENT connections is 120 seconds.  A single broken/malicious machine making 533 connections per second will fill a 64k table.  That is 273 kilobits of outbound data that can take the entire network down.  Yes, you can tweak it, but even if you quarter the timeout you're still at only 1.1 Mbps to take the network down.  With what I proposed (NAT device per customer) even if a user blasted 50 Mbps of SYNs or any other data, the units would only see a moderate slowdown but the Internet would generally keep working.  No tweaking necessary, and there's not even any concern about using quality devices.  However, I will agree that a well configured NAT router will probably be fine with only 3 units.  Maybe.  Large scale connection tracking is generally a terrible idea, but this situation's scale might just be small enough to be OK.  The chance of a malicious, infected, or broken machine doing that to the network goes down as you have less users, and this deployment is relatively small so probably OK.  Part of the reason I brought this up is because I once lived in an apartment building the had a wonderfully fast Internet connection, but the connection table would fill up every day during peak hours.  This would result in already-open connections seeing great speeds even as I sat there unable to make any new TCP connections.  This made me sad.  Oh, and it has been a while since I looked into it, but in the past my experience was always that business class cable connections tend to include at least a few public IPs for free, or at least cheap.  Admittedly this was when IPv4 was more plentiful, so perhaps this has changed."

That is plenty for 3 vacation rental units, even with 3 rokus going at the same time, with bandwidth to spare for browsing.     Each unit with their own router means one person in one unit can't shut off internet to the others.  Your setup doesn't have to be elaborate, and 3 separate 15Mbps would be enough but probably more expensive probably than one 50Mbps connection.  Focus on making money from your rentals.

HomeNetworking,3drlwq,mcmanybucks,5,Sat Jul 18 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"The hardest part of home QoS to understand is this:  You can't prioritize packets except at the point where they are being delayed.  In a traditional setup where you have a router and a cable/DSL modem, the upload delay is all happening in the modem and the downstream delay is all happening on the ISP's device on their end.  Since you don't control either of those devices, you can't directly QoS.  However, the trick people use is to artificially add their own chokepoint, and then prioritize within that chokepoint.  Imagine you have a 1 Mbps upload.  If you configure your router to only allow 0.95 Mbps upload, you now will never have anything waiting in your cable modem's upstream buffer because the max packets ever arrive at it is below the rate it is transmitting upstream at.  At that point, you can configure your router to put certain packets at the front of the line, ensuring they have minimal delay.  The catch is that this upload QoS relies on your upload speed being steady and known.  If you upload is officially 1 Mbps, but slows down to more like 0.5 Mbps during peak because of ISP congestion, then your 0.95 artificial delay is faster than the actual upload and you're back to having things lining up to be transmitted in the modem, which you don't control priority within.  Does that make any sense?"

Many years ago, IPs ending in .0 and .255 were never used.  Eventually, people started using them, but found that some operating systems didn't work with them.  Those operating systems were eventually fixed.  But that was 15+ years ago.

For me it is quite the right solution, especially as I don't own a regular tv and don't want to own one.  AFAIK the implementation is similar to Astras SAT>IP standard, so if your smart tv happens to implements this – which I think is not likely though – it could be possible that you could get this to work without anything else.  You can use the thing with anything able to play rtsp streams, like VLC and you can get a m3u playlist directly from the device for that. It makes it quite compatible with anything media center like or any custom setup. The downsides of course are, that this thing will not be able to stream any encrypted pay tv content and that I have no epg in my Kodi setup – which is a limitation to it's simple iptv plugin, not of the DVB-C repeater.

Some devices won't switch to an AP with a better signal with the same SSID if it is a different technology (802.11g vs 802.11n, etc) or different encryption.  This, and too high tx power from the AP's, are the two main reasons why client devices don't roam well.

Install Pfsense or Sophos (much easier to use) on it and set your current router to bridged mode - that will become the AP for your Pfsense instance. If you don't have a router now, try local thrift stores. I've found a few linksys routers, monitors, working PCs, etc. You can score some pretty great shit at those places if you frequent them.    And don't get discouraged by anyone saying that something's over your head. You'll never know everything about anything, so you always have to keep learning.

HomeNetworking,3dm15b,jcy,4,Fri Jul 17 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on your needs, there are 2 systems I'd suggest.  If your needs are <100 mbps, take a look at Alix 2d13.  It is a tiny computer the size of a normal router, but it is x86 so it runs normal Linux distros.  It has 3 100 mbps Ethernet ports and it uses a compactflash card as a hard drive.  I've been running one of these at my home and at my parents for years now.  This uses around 5 watts, which is no worse than the normal home routers...  http://www.yeasoft.com/assets/images/articles/alix-top-7-e1-medium.jpg  For a higher power system, check out  J1900 CPU based systems.  I bought an Asrock Q1900M (motherboard + built in CPU) for $55 then reused a case, power supply, and RAM that I already had lying around.  This is a tremendously more powerful system than the Alix, supports gigabit, and is actually quite a bit cheaper if you already have some of the parts.  This system will use around 20 watts, which is several times that of the Alix but still quite low.  This system is also physically much larger than the Alix since it is microATX.  Much faster CPU speeds, gigabit LAN, and 3 PCIe slots make this a much more flexible system too if you want it to do other things.  I'm currently running the Alix as my router and the j1900 based system as my NAS/homelab-server.  I currently have around 60 mbps of Internet access, which the Alix can handle, but since the Alix only has 100 mbps ports I'm going to run into that limit if my ISP keeps upgrading...  Since it would only cost me around $75 to swap out the Alix for a j1900, I might go ahead and do that soon.  Personally I don't do wifi in my router, and just reuse traditional routers as AP-only devices, but it would certainly be possible to do wifi in the same system.  I also keep my router and my NAS/server as two different boxes, even though I could easily combine them, just because I like the router to be hands-off and stable while I mess with the NAS/server regularly.  I don't want my Internet breaking when I'm rebooting the NAS into the latest kernel, etc...  Oh, and don't try to use a PC as a switch.  You can, but it is a waste.  It is much better to just use an external cheap gig 8 port switch and keep that traffic away from the PC's CPU than trying to put a bunch of Ethernet ports in the PC.  Home routers actually have hardware based switches inside them and don't make the CPU do that, but if you just add a bunch of ports to your PC then all those packets have to be moved between ports by the CPU."

I've never used the APU series though, as it came out more recently than my last purchase.  http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm  Soekris is a competitor with similar systems, but they're generally more expensive.  Soekris is generally considered to be higher quality, but for a home router I don't think it matters.  https://soekris.com/  Personally, I'm probably going to go with the j1900 DIY system I mentioned earlier just because it is so cheap.  I can reuse case, power supply, and RAM that I have lying around and end up spending perhaps $75 total for a system that will be several times faster than Soekris/PcEngines.  Going from 5 watts to 20 watts is still small enough that I'm OK with the increased power use."

So with that in mind   Wire as many devices with CAT5/6 as possible. There's no question that a standalone commercial-grade AP (as /u/sangerpb suggests) will provide better coverage and performance than most consumer-grade router/AP combo devices. You should also get a router with good network QoS (aka traffic shaping) options out-of-the-box, or one that has good OpenWRT/DD-WRT builds available.   QoS (and specifically prioritising by application) is what is going to keep everyone sane and prevent certain chatty applications/games from monopolising the bandwidth.  Things that cannot tolerate latency (games, streaming, VOIP) get high priority; latency-tolerant things like web browsing get standard priority, things like P2P file sharing get low/bulk priority."

There is often a little dance you need to figure out in regards to the boot order between your modem and primary home router.  Boot the devices in the proper order and you should be good to go.  Otherwise if your cable provider needs to do something funky like register MAC ids then you will have to contact them and get your home router registered.  The tech that initially setup your connection probably completed this operation on your primary PC, they usually don't like messing with home routers as that complicates the installation process.  Check with your ISP for more info on establishing an internet connection.  Let them know your home router model number and current modem to see if they have any tips."

All Ethernet cable connections to the PC and document that this works or doesn't work to speed up the troubleshooting.  If it does work then you can take a deeper look into your customizations.  Reapply them one at a time and retest WAN connectivity to isolate what is causing the problem.

HomeNetworking,3dfezw,harry_manbacks,8,Wed Jul 15 21:06:54 2015 UTC,So the modems use channel bonding to get the higher speeds.  At maximum performance the SB6121 can do 4x channel bonding.  TWC will only use some much bandwidth per channel so even with 4x they are only going to let it connect at up to 50mbps.  They are actually only doing two channels at 25.  With the SB6141 it can do up to 8x now TWC uses 4 channels out of the 8x to get up to 100mb.  This is also as a future proofing CYA as they could eventually go up to 300 on their 100mb plan with out the user buy another modem.  get the 6141.

HomeNetworking,3dfezw,mattbuford,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"The plan limit is simply an artificial limit to restrict how much you use and provide different pricing plans.  Your cable modem connects to Time Warner at a higher rate, but then limits your bandwidth usage to the speed specified in your plan.  This also explains why you can go to their web site and change plans and have it take effect immediately without changing hardware.  The only thing that matters is that your cable modem must be capable of your desired service plan or better.  The reason there are different speeds of cable modems was explained well in another comment so I'll skip over that.  In short, some modems can connect to more channels at the same time than others.  My parents have AT&T uVerse and it works similarly as far as the artificial limit goes.  Physically the modem is connected at 24 mbps, but since my parents only pay for the cheap 4 mbps plan, the modem artificially limits them to only allow usage of 4mbps of that connection."

OK, that's a voice module and all those cables a paralleled across the punch downs so the each are connected to a single phone line at once.   You need a data module that terminates each cable individually and then patch to the router as needed. Or, you could do as you suggest and fit plugs, but it's a bit easier to punch onto a terminal than fiddle with plugs. Either way it would be good to shorten the pairs rather than having them like that."

HomeNetworking,3dd5g0,inspir0nd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"First step, if you can, is to place the router a couple feet from the PC with direct line of sight. The antennas should all be parallel to eachother (pointing up is best). Think of the signal as propogating in a big donut shape (aka a torus) around the antenna.  Check signal strength at that point and make sure all antenna connections are good, then do another speed test. If you're still having problems, I would try to adjust the software configuration of both the router and NIC, resetting as much to defaults as possible. Make sure you are using 5ghz. Then try again. If you're still having problems, check for interference. Turn off all wifi devices except the ones you are testing, and try channels at both ends of the spectrum, as well as one in the center (1, 6, 11 IIRC but that may be for the old wifi standards).  You want to get it to work close up. The distance can be around 3 feet or so, you don't want to be too close or that can mess up the signal.   After you get it working close up, then you can try it at a distance.  Keep in mind because there are only 2 antennas your bandwidth is going to be limited, and due to the way wifi works the actual throughput will be about half of what the advertised speed is. But you should still easily be able to break 20mbps, even if you only had one antenna.   We are talking about megabits/sec, not megabytes/sec. Don't forget the unit conversion."

Can only manage to get so close with my PC without completely disassembling my desk, when I get home will move them right down the hall from one another, about 10 feet away. For what it's worth, running a speed test on my phone in the same room as the computer yielded the full 90Mbps download speed.  Are there any specific NIC settings I should be looking under? I've checked in the device manager under properties>>advanced settings, everything looked pretty standard, have not changed any settings since installing. Could it be worthwhile to try uninstalling the drivers and retesting?  I'll do some playing around with wifi channels.  All units have been in megabits per second, my actual download speed has been roughly 2.4MBytes/s when using the card and 8-9MBytes/s when tethered through the phone.  Are you able to recommend a different ac wifi card? Seems pretty likely I'm just going to return this card to amazon"
HomeNetworking,3dd5g0,mustardman24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Most of the important settings will be on the router, and if you are getting full speed via the same router on your phone, it points to a problem with the NIC. The NIC has much bigger antennas than your phone so it shouldn't be a signal issue at all.  I would return it at this point and get something else. I can't recommend any specifically, I personally use a bridge that has its own issues."

For example, at my Uni, they and their own enterprise grade wifi, and rouge access points were hunted down and banned. Sometimes they would show up at your door and tell you to unplug it, sometimes they would just shut off the port on the access switch and wait for the student to complain.    All of the user ports int he same building were on the same VLAN, so we could still play games and share things with our neighbors.  If anyone had more devices in their room than ports available, they could request a free unmanaged switch to get more ports.  If you plug a router into one of the access ports in the room, it will create something called double NAT, which will work as far as making a private network for you, but it may create problems connecting to things from outside."

HomeNetworking,3dds1z,the_birdiman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, so from what I understand of the floor plan, you two (and maybe 2 more) share a suite with 4 people living in it essentially.   In either case, what you have possibly over looked is how the ethernet is wired in the building. The 2 ports in your 2 rooms most definitely go back to a large switch that feeds many people. On top of that, each port or your rooms could be provisioned in separate VLANs all together, meaning you would not be able to use the school network to bridge your 2.  So, the way I see it, if you 1-2 ports in each room actually gets its own divided speed from everyone else, you could do some load balancing. Although most likely overkill, you can set up a box meant for it or a server to load balance 1 connection from each room. The network sent from the load balancing device will be your inside LAN where you can connect the slave router to the master router and not worry about the whole speed split thing.  But I think that is overkill, in all likely hood, the ports in your rooms are all load balanced with everyone else so you would not actually gain anything from having 2 seperate lines (test this and you will find out). If your goal is to have one massive LAN in the suite then just link them together and see how it goes and do not worry about the bottleneck.  Your devices are the last link in a very big chain, so it's hard to play with shit already. But it also depends on your school of course."

Lock your main router into a channel 1-11  and then lock the 2nd router to a different channel but they have to be atleast a channel apart. I use channels 1 and 6. You just cant use for example 5&6. This may not solve your troubles but it will eliminate a commonly overlooked problem when extending a network.

HomeNetworking,3d67pn,betterdeadthanreddit,2,Mon Jul 13 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"So I'd say the potential issue with using your desktop PC to serve network to anything via ICS is that the desktop then needs to be on to use the devices attached to it. This may not necessarily be an issue for you, but in general terms it's best to avoid using Windows client machines (or anything that isn't permanently on really) in a way which other devices rely on for network. Like your ICS example, but also stuff like print servers or file shares. Aside from the machine simply being on, it also has to be working, and having this essential part in the chain as a Windows machine introduces more complexity to that single point of failure. Considering the two devices you want to share are a media server and a TV, being able to use them regardless of whether a separate PC is on or not seems like it'd be advantageous.  I'd say the most robust setup would be to do what you've considered and use the new router as a wireless bridge, which hooks on to your existing network and then provides wired access for both the media server and the rPi linked to the TV.  In terms of having an isolated network to manage the traffic, may I ask what you mean by that in more detail?"

I'm primarily considering that as a short-term solution until the new device shows up but it's just a couple days so I don't care too much.  As for the traffic management aspect, I have other users on the network to consider (roommates/friends/so on) and don't want to slow them down when watching a movie or something.

HomeNetworking,3d67pn,ThePegasi,2,Mon Jul 13 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply; your first paragraph is why I really didn't want to go with the ICS option. I'm primarily considering that as a short-term solution until the new device shows up but it's just a couple days so I don't care too much.   Ah fair enough, in that case it could well be worth a play. I treat my homeless like a big kid would really, I think learning by play is the best way to go about it if you're so inclined. As such, messing around with ICS in the time you're waiting for your new router wouldn't be a bad thing, if only to get familiar with ICS which isn't a bad trick to know.   As for the traffic management aspect, I have other users on the network to consider (roommates/friends/so on) and don't want to slow them down when watching a movie or something. May not be the biggest impact but I'm trying to be courteous.   Ah OK, as I thought. Network courtesy is a good thing in my book. So essentially, you want to avoid slowing down the network for your housemates who are attached to the main router, correct? It may be helpful to give a quick rundown of how LANs work at this kind of stuff, to explain the pros and cons of various options.  So in terms of the traffic used by your media server and raspberry pi, that will be from one device to another across the LAN. This can be described as Layer 2 traffic, which essentially means it's travelling within one subnet. I can go in to this in more detail if you're interested (though based on your network diagrams you seem to understand already), but suffice it to say that on a home LAN, there will almost certainly be one /24 subnet, with an address range of something like 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254. What's important here is that Layer 2 traffic can travel across a switch without ever having to go back to the router, as long as both devices are attached to that specific switch.  So lets say you use your new router as a wireless bridge, and attach it to the existing wireless network served by your existing router, that your housemates also use. You then plug the media server in to one port, and the raspberry pi in to another. Those two devices now sit on your existing LAN, essentially just as if you'd plugged them in to the main router. However, if traffic goes from the media server to the raspberry pi, it goes from one device, to the switching ports on your new wireless bridge, and straight to the other devices. Since the bridge is also a switch, it can handle this traffic itself and doesn't need to send it via the main household router, meaning there's no extra traffic on the network as far as your housemates are concerned.  Now if the either the pi or the media server access the internet, obviously that traffic will need to go back to the router to get out to the internet, but this is no different when using ICS so that's a moot point. Basically, as long as your media server and pi are attached to a switch together, their traffic won't affect your housemates at all.  However, this may not work. Judging from your diagram, am I right in thinking you'll need the pi to connect to the network via wifi, since it's attached to a TV which is in another room from the media server?"

HomeNetworking,3d7ccv,CumSlutBonerFuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"1 Megabyte (MB) = 8 Megabits (Mb).  Also, there is a difference between the speed that you're getting from a server and the bandwidth that you purchased from your ISP. Your ISP allows for speeds up to 25Mbps. The server might have a lower bandwidth from their ISP or does not permit such a high  bandwidth for their clients. Imagine having to pay for a large automatic sliding doors instead of a single door for your business when your customer's foot traffic is few and small.   As for torrenting, remember it's a group of peers who are contributing back to the swarm; not everyone will have high upload speeds (you have a max of 5Mbps, there you go), and some peers will limit their upload speeds. You won't be able to utilize your full bandwidth if the torrent is not big and healthy. Also, remember to enable uploading as some swarms will block peers if their not contributing, along with providing back more to peers who have higher upload speeds."
HomeNetworking,3d7ccv,BIO_Wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:50:39 2015 UTC,"Basically, when you go on speedtest.net, it knows where you are and sends you the Internet from somewhere close-by, so naturally it's faster since it doesn't have far to go. When you use BitTorrent, you're downloading lots of little bits of data from multiple sources all over the world. Each of those chunks, or ""packets"", has to fly by like a million fish as it is transmitted across the sea and into your computer.  Pretty nifty, eh? ;)  As BIO-wolf said, data transfer speed is measured in bits, and file size is measured in Bytes.  8 bits = ~1 Byte.

The 'better' http://imgur.com/kOhEmpE more costly option would be to get a NAS to store any network data and have that connect to a router or switch which then connects to the modem. if the modem also has routing functions (nat, dhcp,...) then you could place a dumb switch in front of it instead of buying a new router.  if you have more than 4 drops youll want to use a switch after the modem or router."

So a router with three streams will do up to 1300Mbit  3) Correct. Most adapters only support one or two streams, but additional streams on the AP helps when you have multiple clients connected.  4) 802.11ac supports up to 8 160Mhz streams, which comes in just under 7Gbit/sec. That said, I read somewhere the AC3200 had two separate 5Ghz radios, so maybe they are three streams each."
HomeNetworking,3d1zfe,dcoulson,2,Sun Jul 12 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"OK.. so a bit of misinformation here (I'm looking at you in particular /u/dcoulson)   Yes, you can use both bands, but your N device will only get N speeds (assuming you haven't set your ac radio on your router/AP to ac only). There is a certain amount of slowdown associated in running mixed mode, but mixed mode with ac clients will be faster than pure N mode. 802.11ac is 1 to 8 streams. Common router configs are 2x2 (2 streams) and 3x3 (3 streams), with 4x4 (4 streams) coming is slowly. Phones get a miserly single-stream implemetation mostly, though there s a very slow push to running 2x2. Channels: with 80MHz wide channels, you get 433Mbps, and with 160MHz wide channels, 866Mbps. Of course, in practice, each stream hits around 100Mbps per client, so don't expect miracles. Yes. (3x 433.3333333 = 1300). Yes, your client devices will also need 3 streams to hit that speed. Atm, it's mostly macbooks that get 3stream cards (broadcom-based), since Intel (the gold standard on Windows and *nix) still hasn't released a 3stream ac card yet. Currently AC3200 routers are triple-radio designs (1x2.4, 2x5; all 3-stream). The idea is to have one 5GHz a/n network, and seperate 5GHz ac network with the router steering you to the right radio. IMO this is solution to a problem that doesn't exist, especially on bigger networks where you have multiple APs and need to overlap coverage a bit to hit that complete coverage metric and the dual radios eat up channels real fast."
HomeNetworking,3d1zfe,ZeDestructor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:10:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  How does channel width work? Is there any reason I shouldn't run 160MHz?
HomeNetworking,3d1zfe,ZeDestructor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"You set it at the router level. More bandwidth, translates pretty directly into... well.. more bandwidth.  There's no technical reason to not run 160MHz wide, but 160MHz wide means bonding 8 5GHz channels (each channel is 20MHz wide) into a single 160MHz channel.. which means a second, third, etc extra AP would interfere with the first. IMO 40-80MHz channels are what should be run thanks to the shorter range of 5GHz depending on how many overlapping APs you have.. 80MHz for an overlap on each side, or 40MHz if you have more overlap."

However, the performance of the router to transfer files over the internet is different from that of  files between hosts in a local network.  You see consumer routers with gigabit ports (built in network switch) for the purpose of transferring files faster locally. Imagine having to transfer a 4GB file locally over your internet connection: it will take a long time. Now with 1Gbps, it's quicker.   When you transfer files over the internet, the internet is composed of multiple networks and routers; you need more power to calculate the best path. This is why you want a good router to be able to perform to the full speed of your internet package.  A good analogy is sending mail locally and sending mail to another city. It's easy to send locally, you know the roads and the houses. It's harder to transfer to another city, as the roads are long and you want to choose the best route.  So long as your network devices support bandwidths higher than your internet package, then you're fine. The only real concern is the strength of your wifi.  Take a look at smallnetworkbuilder.com for a review of your router and the top router chart to look for better routers."

What a lot of Home routers do have to do though is NAT (Change the source address from your internal network to the IP provided for your ISP) as well as forward traffic from the LAN to the WAN possibly encapsulating it in PPP or whatever the connection is using, It used to be you needed a fair chunk of CPU power to handle the faster connections although these days the chips can quite often have hardware accelerated capablities in (i.e part of the SOC that's designed specifically for that purpose) so the main CPU doesn't need to be massively powerful.

A couple easy reasons:  One, those are link speeds and you'll never see actual throughput anywhere near that. So increasing that ridiculous number to something even more ridiculous gives your slightly more reasonable real world speeds. For example, 802.11g is old now, but even it was theoretically 54Mbps. Sounds perfect for your internet, but in reality you would be lucky with 20Mbps.   Two, there are more uses for your home network than just getting your phones onto the internet. For example, I have a little home theater PC/file server in my living room. I can watch movies and such on it in the living room or over my network on the TV in my bedroom or over WiFi on my phone.

HomeNetworking,3cvsi9,vinceskahan,3,Sat Jul 11 04:46:44 2015 UTC,Have you tried powerline adapters and just get off wireless as much as possible?  MOCA adapters are also an alternative if you have coax cables in your walls.  Buy either from Best Buy or a place like it that price matches Amazon and has a 15 day or more return policy.
HomeNetworking,3cvsi9,v-_-v,3,Sat Jul 11 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"Running the wire is definitely a good idea, as you can then put the extender unit somewhere where it doesn't get that good of a signal from the primary, and it won't take 2x the wireless packets for everything.  It's normal and expected for the extension unit to be on different channels than your primary. You don't want them on the same channel. Otherwise they'd shout over each other. This is true if you use a wire between them or not. You want them to have the same SSID and security settings but different channel. That's how multi-AP networks are supposed to be.  You effectively have two problems you're trying to solve: 2.4 and 5 GHz performance. You can have great of the former and bad of the latter, or vise versa. You should get clients capable of each, and know what they're connecting with so you can troubleshoot. You might have crappy 2.4 but 5 is clean.  Also take note that the airport express doesn't have the same capabilities as the extreme. I believe it isn't a true dual band device, as it can only transmit on either 2.4 or 5, not on both at the same time. You might just be able to throw money at the problem by using a second extreme as the extend unit. Then again, I've made expresses work well in the scenario you have. Shrug.  Take note that I live in an apartment building in a VERY urban area and can see a thousand access points, spread among all channels from 1-11, 36-48, and 141-161, and things are fine for me.  To me, it's unclear what the problem is still. Can you describe the issues your having? At this point it could be because of your neighbor's microwave oven for all we know."

Upstairs AP connected to the cable modem doesn't work with me sitting ten feet from it.  Downstairs AP loses connection to the upstairs one.  Straight line of sight 30' from that to my laptop down an unobstructed hallway has no connectivity.  Some days.  Then it magically works.  Pattern I found is that when the twenty+ year old kids moved back in next door, stuff got crazy.  When they move out for a few months, stuff gets good (and there are far less remote access points).  When they move back in, things get unstable again.  Did a trial this weekend running 50' cable down the hallway to connect the two AP, moved the newer Airport Extreme and cable modem to the room near the neighbor beaming the heck out of me.  Factory reset the Airport Extreme (extender) and let it reestablish its setup extending the network.  Now show super better wifi power etc. in NetSpot.

Dead ethernet jack on the router.   The link light shows connectivity between the modem and whatever it is plugged in to. You can test each thing fairly easily. Swap the ethernet cable, if that doesn't fix it, power cycle the modem and plug the PS4 directly in to it. If that doesn't work, it's almost certainly the modem. If it does get online, it's almost certainly the router."
HomeNetworking,3ctw3f,woody345,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"most likely you're blocked.  To explain briefly: DHCP is finnicky, but there are some consistencies.  99% chance you're using DHCP to get your internet IP address from your ISP.  Essentially, this means your IP will change.  but not really.  When your router's DHCP client requests an IP address from your ISP, one of the metrics that's readily available is your MAC address; the DHCP server (ISP side) may recognise your MAC and say 'you already have x IP address' and request your router continues to use that IP.  alternatively, your router may add to the request that 'hey, I had x IP before, is it still available?' - and if it is, continue to use it.  While DHCP may not guarantee a set IP address, there are several functions of DHCP that cause you to be VERY LIKELY to keep your IP.  That is, unless you change the device making the request (eg. your PC, your 'old' router, etc).  I would assert that you've been blocked, banned, blacklisted or otherwise, by IP address, from that specific feed; so when you change your IP, by connecting directly to the modem or using your ""old"" router, the blacklist or block is bypassed because your IP changes; once you go back to the Asus, it requests the same-old IP, and voila. blocked again.  I have no idea if that's correct, I don't have the necessary information or access to verify any of this, it is just my opinion on the most likely scenario.  For future adventurers: cam4 is a risky click.  NSFW (OP should have mentioned that)."

I'm interested as to where you heard that the ERL is slower than the C5, as I'd be very surprised if that's true. One of the main selling points of the Edgerouters is that they offer some of the best routing performance around at consumer prices, as all you're paying for is the router, not the associated wireless capability (or even switching in the case of the Lite) that a combo router must also provide.

It's worth mentioning that by default, the ports are not switching enabled, so that 1 WAN + 2 LAN setup effectively creates two separate LANs, one on each port. You can enable switching on these ports by creating a virtual switch across them, but this will impact upon performance since it'll lose hardware acceleration. You could also just have two LANs and create a route between them, or not even do that and just straight up have a LAN per Airport. But for the easiest solution and closest to a standard router, you'd just use one LAN port and connect it to a switch, which you'd then connect other devices too.

It also has a lot to do with your client-devices,.. what WiFi chipset (and Driver and OS),etc they use.   It also has a lot to do with HOW MANY Wi-Fi devices you have,.. as the more you have,. the more the Router's transmit-power is going to have to be split across devices -- which shortens it's range & signal strength.    ""I'm confused how 2 routers, with seemingly identical specs in every way, can cost $25 or $225.""   If all you're looking at are the marketing-specs listed on Amazon or on the side of the retail-box,.. then you're missing all the meaty details.   The big difference(s) between a $25 Router and a $225 Router,.. is the ""quality of overall design"",... the ""quality of internal components"".. and the ""quality of Firmware/code/OS that runs the Router"".   Cheap Routers (generally speaking) are built around SOC (System On a Chip).. which is basically a SINGLE chip (or single CPU) that has to split it's resources to single-handedly handle CPU/Ethernet/WiFi and other activity. Most cheap Routers have say a 533mhz CPU (or slower) and 32mb RAM,etc or less.   Expensive Routers are built from higher quality internal components. Typically they have dedicated internal chipsets (dedicated CPU, separate Ethernet chip, separate WiFi chip,etc) -- and because of that the Router is more robust and can handle a higher activity load. They're typically also 600mhz to 1ghz+ CPU's (some are dual-core).. and have anywhere from 128mb to 256mb of RAM (some have 512mb RAM or more) and 128mb to 256mb of Flash Firmware space.   Comparing a $25 Router to a $225 Router.. is like comparing a $300 Netbook to a $1,500 Macbook Pro. There's a world of difference.   Having said all that,... and I strongly believe in recommending nice high quality Routers (such as ASUS or Apple Airport Extreme). ,.. the Router is only 1 part of the equation. You could still have client-devices with shitty WiFi chipsets. You could still have environmental issues (chickenwire in your plaster walls, interference from nearby signals,etc)....   BUT --- you're never going to go wrong buying a nice high quality Router. At least if you do that,.. you can (somewhat) assume the Router is not the problem."
HomeNetworking,3cssta,jmnugent,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"Seconded! There are so many factors influencing real-world wifi strength, it's impossible to get a real idea unless you can try them in your house. Better routers should have stronger signals, but even there, it's not sure.  Maybe you could use an external AP instead of the usually shitty internal antennas and chipset of home routers, like a Unify AP. The Unify AP-LR is the ""long range"" model and should reach the corners of your house.  Another thing you can do is a site survey. Get a wifi analizer app on a laptop or on your phone, walk in all the rooms, write down signal strength and signal to noise ratio. Move the router to another possible location and check everywhere again. It takes time, but you may be able to find a sweet spot where you can put your router and get better signal throughout the house."

If I were to visit 192.168.0.2:80, your firewall would block/ignore the request, even though it's going to the same router/firewall as .1.  That's how I'd set it up at least.

HomeNetworking,3cr84d,notdedicated,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:35:28 2015 UTC,no. normally my wireless router is connected to my modem. i have never stuck a switch in between the router and modem and have everything talk.
HomeNetworking,3cr84d,notdedicated,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:40:44 2015 UTC,If you put a switch in the ??? place then all of your devices are going to ask for IP addresses from your modem and your ISP which will likely not work.  You need a router between your network and your modem. Is there a reason you're suggesting moving the wireless router from where you have it? What is it you're attempting to achieve?
HomeNetworking,3cr84d,Cferra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:06:16 2015 UTC,Unless you are going to use a vlan capable switch your drawn configuration will not work.  Even then I'm not 100 percent it will work.   You need a device on the edge of your network to handle routing from your LAN to your WAN. When connecting a switch to your modem - the switch with either be transparent and assign the first device connected to it your public IP or it will take the public IP for itself - in the case of a smart switch.   You want your gear to go like this. Modem -> router -> switch.
HomeNetworking,3cr84d,Jumpin_Jack_Flash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:04:26 2015 UTC,can i use a cheap non wireless router instead of a switch?
HomeNetworking,3cr84d,Cferra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, you won't have much room to expand your wired network until you add a switch, but you can get a cheap wired router in place of a switch and configure eveything as your diagram suggests. though I would turn off DHCP on the wireless router plugged into it and static it's IP. Use it as an access point instead. Let the wired router handle your IP addresses on wired and wireless."

HomeNetworking,3cq4kp,StinzorgaKingOfBees,3,Thu Jul 9 21:44:20 2015 UTC,Setup a pfsense box and use that for your router. It's a pretty cool soho project and it helps teach firewall basics and concepts and has an active community.   Other than that get some managed networking gear and play around with that and the cli.   Also you can download packet tracer by Cisco. Its free for their academic students but It's out there and pretty simple to find if you were so inclined.  You can use this to simulate networking with Cisco gear it's pretty sweet and way more convenient than buying old Cisco gear on eBay.   Cisco also has an academic - game - that teaches a lot of networking concepts and it's kinda strangely fun. This is also similarly easy to find if you wanted.
HomeNetworking,3cq4kp,Cferra,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this sounds like a big help!  If I could ask a few questions, what is a pfsense box, what does it do, and what is it's purpose in a network?  I think I know what a packet tracer would do, is it just for tracing the flow of data through a network? If I'm wrong, what is the purpose of it?  I'll check out the game, I am a gamer so that will probably help a lot! Thanks again, I really appreciate it."
HomeNetworking,3cq4kp,Cferra,2,Thu Jul 9 22:56:20 2015 UTC,Pfsense is a router / firewall distribution that you can build from of parts. Pretty cool. Packet tracer is basically a Cisco emulator and you can use that to emulate networking things together
HomeNetworking,3cp68t,IndigoMoss,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately with wireless there's any number of things that can decrease speed such as interference or mis-matched protocols, like a phone supporting only 802.11g using an 802.11n access point. Whenever you see the theoretical max bandwidth of wireless it's wise to take 1/3 of that speed and that's probably the max that you might see.   I just did a speed test at my house: I get around 60Mbps down on my wired computer and 30Mbps on my phone connected to my 802.11n 5GHz band (which is about 2 feet away). It's pretty normal for wireless to get much less than wired. I'd check to see what protocol and wireless band your AP is running on and also possibly use a spectrum analyzer to see if there's any neighboring wireless networks possibly contributing to congestion.   Also it's worth noting that whenever you are going to use wireless you have to understand that it operates under CSMA/CA - Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance. This is essentially operating at half-duplex speeds."

Unless explicitly disabled, each WiFi device will connect to the other WiFi device at its best connection protocol, eg 802.11n-802.11n or 802.11g-802.11g, etc.  Everything is backwards compatible, eg your 802.11n access point can also be used with 802.11g and 802.11b devices.

HomeNetworking,3cmqfa,Kirby420_,2,Thu Jul 9 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, this is probably non-standard and many will think it's an awful idea, but rather than running Ethernet through walls, I'd mount some cable trays along various walls between all anticipated endpoints so I can easily replace any dead cables without having to tear out the Sheetrock or guess at where they run. Any drops from this will be channeled through PVC piping mounted to the walls. Cable run groups within the tray will be velcro tied together to the tray.  Most of my copper wiring will be Cat 6 terminating in electrical boxes mounted to wood blocks that are affixed to the location I need them to be at by Velcro (with slack in the runs being tied up via Velcro near the endpoints of the runs). I will have a fiber run or two between the primary computer station and the central networking area as well as between the central networking area and the primary entertainment center. I will have switches at each of these 3 locations.  It won't be the prettiest, but it'll be relatively easy and relatively cheap to maintain once installed."

There are a few apps that can do this - I'm not sure about the Mac side. But on PC you have wireshark which is free or you have solar winds which is very not free I'm sure there are others as well.   You can get a standup a utm like Sophos utm which can analyze traffic in so far as to provide intrusion protection and high level traffic analysis or pfsense with the appropriate plugins or untangle. All of which are free or have free community versions.  I'm sure there are others of these types of solutions as well.   They do make specific wifi chipsets for traffic analysis as well

Though, at the speeds you're talking about from the ISP, it would never drop below the slowest ethernet standards, 10Base-T (10mbit).  So no matter what, you're fine.  No need to spend money and power on a fancy wifi connectivity setup.  too difficult to maintain.  direct bury cable is where you should be, just be sure to run the line to a router or switch in the house before it goes very far.  In this scenario: dish to ISP box: ~250ft (across the shop), then ~275 for the buried line between the buildings.

HomeNetworking,3ckp39,FetmanArg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:42:12 2015 UTC,Such is the nature of wireless. You cannot assume it's going to be reliable. It could be that someone else nearby has recently turned on a device which is interfering with your WAP.  You could try live-booting with Ubuntu to see if that gives you the same packet loss issues.
HomeNetworking,3ckp39,evemanufacturetool,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:20 2015 UTC,Looks like a range or channel issue. Try changing the channel on hone wifi router. You can get some wifi analyzer software to find the least crowded channel. Also make sure that there are no devices that run on the 2.4 ghz band that might interfere with your wifi signal.
HomeNetworking,3ckp39,Cferra,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have a tp-link wireless card in a desktop machine on Win7 Ultimate which suddenly started doing exactly the same thing - no other wireless clients were affected in the same location. I gave up trying to fix it and ran a slightly unsightly cable instead..."
HomeNetworking,3cjcx4,canoemoose,2,Wed Jul 8 10:52:49 2015 UTC,Very little streaming is to be done so the UAP should be fine. Even with streaming it should be great especially for home use. I've been managing about 75 of them at multiple businesses and they've been very reliable and provide stellar coverage and performance.  I'd recommend the UAP-LR over the UAP as it has much better range.   Make sure to set aside some time to familiarize yourself with the controller software. It's not overly complex and has some decent features.
HomeNetworking,3cjcx4,J0hnnyCache,2,Wed Jul 8 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"My first hand experience with the UAP-LR is 10 MB/s (80 mbps) file transfer speeds when the AP and client are in the same room.  Transfer speed is halved when the client is 75 feet away from the AP with the signal passing through 2 drywall walls.  Solid brick and concrete walls severly degrade the signal to the point of unusability.  Depending on what you have to back up, those speeds may or may not be acceptable. Keep in mind 10 MB/s equals 36 GB/h.  You are better off installing more low power APs close to the clients than trying to cover the whole area with a couple high power APs."
HomeNetworking,3cjcx4,sparkplug188,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard mixed reviews about the UPA-LR...  My house is all concrete block internal walls.  I'm probably going for one UAP in the loft at the rear-left of the house and another UAP in a ground-floor single-story loft at the front-right of the house, unless you've got a better idea... final positions will be decided after I've been able to have a play with Ekahau Heatmapper."

HomeNetworking,3cjcx4,dunnybloke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"The main difference between the UAP and the UAP-PRO is (other than it having GigE) is the Pro is dual-band so has both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radios, the UAP only has 2.4Ghz.  If the 2.4Ghz in your house isn't congested then I wouldn't bother with a UAP-PRO"
HomeNetworking,3ckdw0,ScapegoatZovc,2,Wed Jul 8 16:23:51 2015 UTC,"Really depends what you want. as well as your budget.  Your local home improvement store will probably have some cable channels meant for use on the wall that has adhesive backing to put it on the wall. Just use alcohol or goo gone to clean it off when you leave if there's any remaining marks. There should also be boxes that'll attach to it nicely for you to use some modular punch down jacks. This will increase the $/foot by A LOT though.  The real issue you're gonna have is getting from 1 room to another if there's a door way, If it's a snug door frame there's not gonna be much room, hopefully theres room to fit it under the doors, otherwise you'll have to find a way to get creative. I know in an older appartment in the Cable company ran shielded cable through a return vent...  Personally, depending on how long you plan to stay there I'd talk to the landlord and see what (S)HE thinks. If you're planning on staying there awhile, see if you can convince the landlord that having ethernet ran throught the place is marketable and you'd be willing to do it for free. If you go this route, just make sure you don't do a shoddy job and make sure it actually looks properly done."

HomeNetworking,3ckdw0,iNeedAValidUserName,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, security deposits are tricky, they're there to protect the landlord because a bad tennant can do way more harm in a short time than a ton of good tennants can over years.  If you do a crappy job they'll probably charge you so they can make it look good again. If you decided to remodel their kitchen and give it a 5,000$ face lift - they probably won't mind so much.  Always better to ask though if you're even the least bit uncertain. If you don't have a security deposit though, there's really no reason not to."

Wifi might be adequate but I imagine the other tennants are cluttering the channels and I don't want to fight that. I want the reliability of a wired connection between my PC and HTPC because I'll likely do Steam in-home streaming. Beyond that, I just want all LAN activity to be as snappy as possible. That way, anyone who uses the wifi won't be fighting with devices that could be wired in on top of any clutter that there may be between radio signals."

HomeNetworking,3chc45,MegalosZ71,4,Tue Jul 7 22:28:33 2015 UTC,For this sized house you'd really want a unified system line the ubiquiti N access points - you have to run cables to locations where you want to put hem - probably in hallways to maximize coverage and I recommend going with the n access points due to the roaming features that the ac access points do not currently have
HomeNetworking,3chc45,Cferra,4,Tue Jul 7 22:49:26 2015 UTC,This. The ubiquiti access points (the little round discs) are awesome. They're affordable and for your size home you really only need two probably. I did my folks home which is a good bit larger and used a total of four of the regular ones (not the LR version). Have worked great and they're painless to set up.

HomeNetworking,3chc45,Vertikar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"Not n routers but the ubiquiti n wireless access points have a seamless roaming feature that allows for dropless transition from access point to access point. They have not been able as of yet to bring this feature to their ac access points.   Normal routers will not have this feature, it is an enterprise level feature that is a major benefit in a large home and would be great in your situation. And it's honestly not that much more expensive than a top quality router.  You would still need at least 1 router though at the edge - I like Asus routers but ubiquiti makes those too although they have a small learning curve.   If you wanted to go for simplicity - I'd maybe go with an apple router and the ubiquiti ac access points.   Better routing performance would be an Asus router.   Best routing performance would be the ubiquiti edge router."

HomeNetworking,3chc45,pat_trick,4,Tue Jul 7 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"The APs will still need power, and in this case, they work via Power Over Ethernet, or POE.  You'll also get more stable communication if you have a cable running to each Access Point in your household."
HomeNetworking,3chc45,BetterHomeWifi,2,Tue Jul 7 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"They can run wirelessly, but you said that you're looking for good performance, so you really should connect them via Ethernet cable to the router.  If you don't care about performance or reliability, then use wireless."

HomeNetworking,3civug,zalemam,2,Wed Jul 8 06:51:59 2015 UTC,It's not so much the freq but the wifi standard - does all your gear support the wifi standard that the arris gateway supports? Does your router support the same standard or better? If so and the router you have does joy support 5ghz and your gear does than that may be a reason to move but remember that 5gh does not have the same range or penetration as 2.4 so you may have an overall weaker signal than you would on 2.4 that being said / 5ghz has less saturation than 2.4 so you have a better chance for a clean signal where you do get a signal that is

You're essentially looking at carrier grade performance at consumer prices. They aren't the simplest and don't have the additional features or built in Wi-Fi but they will handle gigabit speeds without issue. In the past we did test a nighthawk couldn't get past about 600Mb before falling over. That was on an early firmware though.

And compared to those all-in-one routers, you get better performance and options down the road if you want them. I got my home networking setup started on one, and am still using it despite doing more complicated stuff now, it's just a great device.  You'd have to buy a Wireless Access Point as well and configure that too, but again I don't think that's necessarily something that should put you off, and the price of an Edge Router Lite and basic UniFi is comparable to a higher end all-in-one router anyway."

HomeNetworking,3cglpc,Bluman56,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:21:55 2015 UTC,It is possible. You want the second router to not behave as a router at all. You could get another Asus router and set it up in bridge mode. Connect the two by one of their LAN ports (not WAN) and put it in bridge mode to disable things like DHCP and firewall. It'll behave as a switch and AP.   Or you could just get a cheap switch and an AP since that's what you're after.

All you need to do to do what you're asking is turn DHCP off on the router you're going to use as the switch, and then do not use the ""Internet"" port.  Plug your adapter into one of the LAN ports.   This will turn the router into a switch/AP"

The deal is that the belkin routers - pre linksys buyout are not really known to be premium or the fastest devices and it may not have a gige wan port which means that the 100 meg ISP connection is saturating the wan port on the router and this will limit your internet speeds  that said - wired and wifi speeds you described on that router are probably inline with what you could expect from this router but there are other things to consider as well.   Do you have a switch in your networking setup as well?  Is it gige?  Are your PC or laptop adapters gige?  This will effect the max throughout to your ISP as well.   According to belkin's spec page. That router only has 10/100 connections.  http://m.belkin.com/us/p/P-F9K1102/  This explains the approx 40mbit down speeds wired from the router.   All things being equal - no switch or gige switch and gige adapters - hardwired you should hit that subscribed speed. Faster wifi standards will get you that speed over wifi as well.

If you want to connect more than one device to your modem you need to disable that. This presumes that you have access to the device, which might not be the case if the modem belongs to your provider.  In addition the router functionality of this device seems to be pretty limited. I think the best would be to put your router (TP-Link) back where the modem is and buy a separate device to boost the Wifi (ideally an access point but most routers can be set up as an access point as well)."
HomeNetworking,3cd05h,TechSavyBob,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Radiation from heat or from the microwaves on the AP? I wouldn't be concerned otherwise unless the device is overheating.   For concerns about scalability, I would look at adding Access Points (AP) instead of additional routers. APs will expand your existing networks with additional wireless locations and distribute the load if your hosts are evenly distributed. Routers do have a AP built in, but they segregate the network with NAT and ultimately add unnecessary complexity.  For placement, it looks like your wireless router in the networking closet is having issues with the metal box. I would either put it outside or add another AP while disabling the radio on the wireless router. The wireless router will have difficulty penetrating the metal box of your network closet (Faraday cage). Also, maybe another one in the bedroom is the EA6700 is not penetrating those walls. Be sure to set the EA6700 to AP mode to avoid double NAT.   Also, do a bandwidth test on your Etisalat's D-Link router (direct wire) to see if it can route to the full bandwidth of your connection. This will determine if your router can route the full bandwidth of your connection to the ISP. Do this at different times of the day if you are using a coaxial/cable Internet."

I wouldn't worry much about coverage/placement and bandwidth (due to the fact that our government rips us off :S), but if it was way lower than it was advertised what would you do? i am interested to reconfigure our EA6700 to act as an access point. Although i cannot get passed the default gateway 192.168.1.1 without Etisalat interfering with their D-Link router setup.

A straight-through phone cable would still be 4 wires in parallel so why go through the trouble of getting the colors to match/split the pair?  It almost feels like a green horn joke about sending the new guy out for a tub of elbow grease, a left handed hammer and a can of steam...  Part of me thinks it might have to do with electronic interference in old plugs but I don't really know anything about electronics.  Background/Backstory:  I only really mess with networking when I need it to do something... I picked up a bin of scrap CAT5 about 8 years ago and found a wire crimper in the bottom. Set up an 8 workstation LAN in my college apartment (fun times) and haven't crimped a cable since this weekend when one of the longer cables went bad...   Thought I was doing it wrong for the first 3 or 4 tries until I tried another cable... Not much fun.

I believe the actual ordering in the standards was originally meant so the middle two would be a pair, then the next outermost a pair, etc. [43211234]. But having the outermost pair that far apart (pair 4) messes with the design of keeping the signal clean from interference (the whole point of the twisted-pairs), so they changed it to [22311344]. I think having [11223344] would be a problem (not so much these days though) because legacy voice would use a centered pair, and the center wires in this case aren't a pair [23]."

HomeNetworking,3cde5x,probiotiv,2,Tue Jul 7 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"Your link shorted the url and doesn't work, so I assume it's this one: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6370-QPHJ-3567.  The article is trying to explain that the port 27005 cannot be used by two concurrent hosts at the same time. A port is like a door where people can enter and leave from, but only one person may do so at a given time. The port becomes reserved for the host using it, so this is why you need to set in the settings manually to reserve another port not used.   On the router end, the router works in a special way: it becomes the middleman between the server and hosts inside your network. When a packet arrives on your router, there's an destination and source address and port. The source address and port is that of your computer, but the router will instead replace the source address with its own address and a different port number. This way, when someone contacts that different port number on the router, the router knows to send that packet to your computer. Sort of like a PO box that is reserved for you only.   We need to know how you wired your network up (i.e. if your pfSense box is connected to another router or how the hosts are connected) before we can resolve anything. When you were using your pfSense box, how was it set up? Did you use one physical port for WAN and the LAN port to a switch or one of the DD-WRT routers? How was your devices connected?"

FOr testbed #2 (ispmodem)----->tomato/dd-wrt Router (stock settings with dhcp server) -----switch - Lan computer clients.  now with the pfsense router connected, i do not have to do anything but start couterstrike2 and everything works automatically.  no special settings. No port forwarding, no special command line parameters on the Lan client side.  However, with the tomato/dd-wrt routers connected, I can only connect one client to the same counterstrike game on the internet.  In order for the 2nd Lan client to connect, I have to manually specify the clientport according to the article.    other clues: on the pfsense box, upnp is not enabled.  ON the tomato/dd-wrt routers I played with upnp (but apparently counterstrike doesnt use it), and messed with other special NAT trackers but nothing prevents me from having to set the clientport setting. its not that big of a deal, since everything else works with the little routers... but I just that this was weird and wondered if there was a special command I needed to input into the tomato/dd-wrt command line to make it function like pfsense.

Like you, i always had to play with openwrt and 50 different devices to get guests throttled and isolated from my lan. You have 2 expensive and good routers there, save one for later (spare) and take off the wrt150. Plug an unifi-uap to your main router and thats it. The unifi-uap will give you 4 ssid with guest capabilities and bandwidth limitation per user if needed, easy and fast, you wont believe how much work it saves. In this setup you would have the 2 access points, with the unifi being the one with -not only- guest features.  Now, about the problem. Your setup is ok. Are you sure the Netgear/Asus dont have guest throttle? I dont know these routers, but they are flagships.  You have to break this problem into parts, which of the 3 wifi is breaking?

Most of my equipment is older business grade, which goes steepen the learning curve to using it, especially if you are not familiar with networking and linux concepts.   In your situation, I would not concern myself getting the highest grade Ethernet cable. Either CAT5e or CAT6 will work just as fine. Both will operate up to Gigabit Ethernet without issues.   As for switches, depends on the complexity of my network. If I was going for a typical consumer network that is simple to use and to troubleshoot, then any Gigabit unmanaged switch will do. In Canada, I found that the TP-Link and D-Link Gigabit switches are pretty affordabled. I would either buy a 24 port Gigabit switch new or used (works just fine).   I don't have much experience with routers, but I see that the Edge Router Lite and some of the top routers at www.smallnetbuilder.com/ are pretty good.   For where to put most of the equipment, I'd put it where all of your room wiring is terminated, typically the basement.

I recommend leaving the DHCP reservation on the router in place so that it doesn't cause problems if the PC goes offline.  If this is set to DHCP and still not working, try the following:  Win+R > type ""cmd"" and hit enter  ipconfig /all   Check the MAC and IP address on the correct adapter matches what is set on the router. if DHCP is set, and the MAC matches, but the IP does not match:  ipconfig /release   wait for prompt to return and you'll lose connectivity  ipconfig /renew   Ensure that the new IP address matches the intended address.  Hope this helps!"

When you do this, the second router will act as an AP, not a repeater.  Devices will connect to it wirelessly, and communicate to the rest of the network and internet through the ethernet cable to the first router.  I also use an old second router as another AP to boost the wifi range in my house.  The reason DHCP needs to be off is if it isn't, it will create a second subnet on your network and devices on the first router won't be able to see the devices on the second router.  All devices would get internet though, and a lot of people run into this problem when trying to share things on the network, so just enable DHCP on one router for the whole network is the way to go."

HomeNetworking,3cboq7,acrispytatertot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:36:13 2015 UTC,A repeater takes a wi-fi signal and amplifies it. It's not plugged into the network by ethernet cabling. In general they work terribly and I doubt you could make the DIR-600 act as a repeater anyway. If you have it hooked up by ethernet cable as you seem to be saying you can likely have it act like another wireless access point. I did just that with a spare DIR-655. All I had to do was disable the DHCP server on it and it worked fine. Set the SSID (wireless network name) and the password to the same on both and most clients will switch between the two access points transparently.

This is not possible without policy based routing and you can run into asymmetrical routing issues.

HomeNetworking,3c97yv,CBRjack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"Latency is the time it takes for your packet to reach the other end and come back. The biggest factor to consider is where to bottleneck is and what is happening there.  The bottleneck is your internet connection. This is not something you can change unless you're willing to upgrade / pay more.  What is happening there is something you can change though. When people generate traffic on your lan, packets are sent to the router, any packets that are generated faster than the output speed (your internet connection) get put in a buffer. Lots of packetseans the buffer is filling, and your latency goes up because your packets are waiting in line to get out.  The solution : QoS. QoS simplified is looking at packets before putting them in line. With rules and priority, it's loke a VIP pass, those packets requiring higher priority go through instantly, while lower priority packets wait in line.  If you can configure QoS on your router, you can give yourself a higher priority, usually by IP address. Use a static IP, or a static DHCP lease to make sure your IP won't change.  It's tempting to put QoS up to 100% of the connection, but don't! Usually, no more than 80-90% of your actual limit should be put as the QoS limit. If not, your packets will go through, no other packets will. This will block everyone else, but it also means the buffer is filling. Once full, it can start dopping packets, and on residential routers, it can just cause the router to crash.  Enable QoS, set your IP, set your priority, set 80% of your bandwidth, them check if the issue persist. If it does, tune things, see if it changes. If it solves your issue, don't fiddle with it.  Also, be considerate, dropping everyone as second priority will cause lag on their side. It's ok if it's your internet connection, but if not, make sure you don't prevent others from functionning (ex: someone on skype might need to be set to be high priority also, it will slightly impact your game, but if not set, skype will be unusable...)"

Any pipe can only fit so much water inside it before it's got no more physical room. When that happens, the water has to wait around in a line before it gets to take it's ride through the pipe.   What affects how your latency changes when someone else connects is it the upload, download, or something completely else   Upload or download can both saturate your connection, it depends on which is being used. If someone's watching Youtube or Netflix, then it's your download that's being filled up. If someone's uploading some files or seeding a torrent, then your upload is what's being filled.

HomeNetworking,3c8jbe,westexasman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"First off, because there is a sudden change in performance it's likely not going to be your router at fault. It sounds like interference from another device... Your best bet is to use a WiFi scanner and see if you can move your routers signal to another non populated channel. Please remember though, the perpetrator may not be visible because the interference may not be coming from another WiFi router, it could be anything from a baby monitor to an RC Car. I can see you've got a dual-band router so try using the 5GHz signal where you can.   Secondly, WiFi Range extenders should only be a last ditch effort, it could even be causing (or most likely be a factor) the problem here. (If so, I should probably note it would affect all wireless devices connecting to both the router and repeater). They often just rebroadcast the signal over the same channel, reducing your bandwidth in half and creating more interference in the process too.  To avoid using your repeater you could perhaps look at upgrading your router and moving it to a more central location. Perhaps you may have the opportunity to run a few cable drops to some high bandwidth devices or you could even look into technologies such as PowerLine.   Good luck!"
HomeNetworking,3c8jbe,stevepork,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"So, the interference is only an issue on iPads.  We have 2 iPads, a Nexus 7 (2013) and 2 LGG2 phones along with 2 laptops that run off of the Wi-Fi. The interference only occurs on the iPads when connecting to Safari or Chrom or Facebook. It's so specific. I can surfing the web on my laptop and the wife's iPad won't allow her to connect on Safari, but she can play internet based games without an issue.   I'll check the extender. I wasn't 100% with that purchase, but it was cheap so I thought I'd see if it would help. It hasn't been a hindrance, at least I don't think. I'll unplug it and see if that helps.  Thanks for the info!"
HomeNetworking,3c8jbe,kingp43x,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting a new modem (check to see that it matches your ISP), and then getting an AC router.  Hopefully from there you could use your old router as an AP and you should be good to go.  My extender has been taken out of the loop, it was unreliable / didn't seem to help much.  Buy your modem and drop what is likely $10 a month on the one from your ISP."

It only does this when I turn my laptop on. Disabling the adapter and re-enabling it doesn't change anything either. Once I manually disconnect and reconnect it shows my SSID.  This is what I see in the Merge or Delete Network Locations. Here you can see the ""Network"" that my laptop automatically connects to every day. I've tried multiple ways to delete it to no avail.

Disable DHCP on all but the router connected to the modem.  You only need 1 DHCP server per network. Configure all 3 devices to have the same wifi settings, except channel.  This includes SSID, encryption type, security key, etc.  Configure each to use a separate channel.  Pick from 1, 6, or 11 for 2.4ghz.  5ghz has more available channels but you want them spread apart as much as possible. Plug cables from main router to switch ports, not WAN, into each of the other two router's (now just APs) switch ports.

HomeNetworking,3c45lr,ravenwarsong,4,Sat Jul 4 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna elaborate a bit on what /u/ravenwarsong posted.  First it would be good to disconnect the D-Link router from the ""old"" one and only connect your PC/laptop over ethernet to be able to configure it correctly.  After you have done that you have to access the web interface of the DIR-655 (most likely on http://192.168.0.1).  Disable DHCP on Network Settings -> DHCP Settings by clearing the box.  Also under Network Settings is Router Settings. There you have to change the IP Address to something that fits into the range of your current network (Example: Your old router has the address 192.168.1.1, so the D-Link needs something like 192.168.1.2. Your old router has the address 192.168.0.1, then you just have to change the last digit from 1 to 2. This all presumes that there is no other device on the network with the IP address x.x.x.2.)  After you have done this you won't be able to connect to the D-Link because you have just changed it's address. Connect the DIR-655 back to the old router as it was before.  Then you should be able to connect with the new address (e.g. 192.168.1.2). Go to Wireless Settings and chose the manual config option. Change the network name to the name of your existing wifi network. Disable auto channel scan and chose a channel that is not yet used (e.g. channel 6 if your old router is on channel 1, channel 11 if your old router is on channel 6). Select 20MHz as channel width.  The security setting should be the same as on the other router."

I've never worked with a patch panel.  2) On the note of a patch panel. Why use one at all in a home? Why not just run the cables directly through the conduit in to the switch and then in to the router?  3) Would this set up work with 2x Netgear Nighthawk x6's?

You'll know they are all the same size and if you don't have a cable tested, having a few spares will do the job. This is what we do at work. (Everyone is too busy to be punching down cables). If it's a ""dumb"" regular switch, it'll be stupid easy. Connect any ports from the patch panel, to any ports on the switch. Connect any port from the switch, to a LAN port on the router. That's it. Even some smart switches will operate this way out of the box... it's only when you start playing with subnets and vLANs that things get more complicated. You don't usually need this in a home set up.  Always hardwire whatever AP it is you decide on. Sure the Netgear router would work as primary. And yes you can use another one as an AP. Personally I think it's a waste of money to buy a second, but if you already have one, stick with it. Buy a Unifi AP instead, very easy to setup and administer. Enterprise features included.   As for the patch panel question; no you don't need one, it just makes things cleaner. From the wall it goes to the patch panel, then to the swicch.

HomeNetworking,3c4q2m,TsuDoughNym,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:07:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. Start reading reviews for the latest and greatest powerline adapters. I'd lean more towards powerline than wifi router/repeaters.

HomeNetworking,3c4q2m,ldjarmin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"Ok so OP, you won't be able to do two separate modems unless you pay for a second outlet, which is honestly a waste of $10-$20/month, because fuck Comcast.  The problem, or benefit, with that method would be you'd have two distinct WAN IP's (your public IP address) so if you had special networking needs that might work well, but you're paying extra for it.  You've got the right idea when it comes to powerline adapters.  They use the existing copper wiring in your house as the conduit to transfer the signal from the transmitter, which would ideally be a power outlet closest to your modem, to the ""receiving"" end in your living room.  And yes, you'd connect the cable from the receiver to the multi-port switch to extend the connection to multiple devices.  Don't worry about affecting quality --- routers and switches these days are amazing.  Much faster/better/more reliable signal than wireless.  Remember that transmitting Ethernet over copper has an inherent length limitation of 100m or ~300 ft, after which distance the quality of the signal drops significantly and you'd suffer from dropped packets or lost signal.  So depending on the distance between your transmitter/receiver, this is something to take into consideration.  Remember that the wiring in your house most likely won't be in a straight line from A--Z, so keep that in mind when estimating distance.  Your other option, which would be more costly/potentially degraded signal, depending on the setup of your house would be a wireless router with a signal repeater/booster somewhere along the way.  I personally have an ASUS RT-N66R that has served me faithfully for three years, and then I have a spare Linksys WRT54G that I have DD-WRT running on.  This let's me get extended functionality, for instance, using the Linksys as a wireless repeater.  That Amazon link is expensive as fuck for such an old router, but the idea is there:  Use the modem as a wireless signal receiver, and then access the internet via it's wired ports.  The problem in my particular situation is the ASUS is an N-band router, and the Linksys is G-band, so the speed difference is significant.  I don't always keep my Linksys running, but usually have it on if I have guests that need better signal in my spare bedroom.  Of course you could also buy a commercial wireless repeater, which has the benefit of not needing as much setup, but the detriment of not having as much flexibility ---- it's only job is to repeat the signal, which is may or may not do potentially very well.  Using a soft 'hacked' router provides more flexibility but requires just a little bit of time/effort to tweak it.  Hope this helps and gives you a better idea.  Feel free to ping back with any questions/concerns!"

And for clarity, many people summarize layer 1 as cabling, it's not quite that simple.  It's cabling and all the physical characteristics of the signalling between two points.  If one end is in an ethernet port and the other is in a T1 port, the connection won't work because the signalling is different. (it becomes a ""duh"" when I spell it out like this): however, in cases where you have up/down, that means that the interface cannot agree with the remote side (or cannot understand it) in order to agree on the signalling speed (10/100) and duplex.  While they might be using the same ""language"" (ethernet), if the speed/duplex is still wrong, it still won't work.  Though, in your case, you're set to auto/auto: so I'll jump to: I'm sorry about your port.  Try Fa0/1. see if there's a change.  Should be quick to drop a no ip address on Fa0/0 and a shut, then drop an ""ip address 69.x.x.x ..."" and a ""no shut"" on fa0/1.  if fa0/1 works and fa0/0 doesn't then it will be the port that's broken."

In order to prioritize a connection, it must buffer incoming packets.  This introduces latency.  Latency kills TCP performance, especially when you are dealing with consumer class hardware.    2) QoS isnt for home networks  QoS (or CoS), works by inserting extra information into packets which allows you to prioritize/deprioritize traffic by its tag as it is.  Incoming packets are buffered, typically 1k packets or less, packets with more important numbers go first.   QoS is designed for larger networks because the real gains in performance are when every device along the way respects the tag on incoming packets and prioritizes those connections.    Your ISP won't respect whatever tag you insert. The technology they us transmit data may not be the same, and if it is, they will certainly insert their own tags.

HomeNetworking,3bzlan,djgizmo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"Do you have a dedicated switch in addition to your router?  Do you have dedicated access points that make it possible to use a wired only router or does it have to do both?  My ideal world consists of a dedicated router/firewall/UTM like /r/homenetworking's favourite the EdgeRouter Lite, with a dedicated switch, and dedicated APs. You can pickup some seriously good hardware from CL / Ebay on the switch front and APs can run pretty cheap when you're just getting an AP.  Aside from that, I've been pretty partial to the Asus all-in-ones, i've read a few online reviews of the Nighthawk that are not overly favourable though it should obviously be taken with a grain of salt and YMMV.  Edit: There's also something I should point out, a single computer on your network will not achieve anywhere near gigabit speeds. To get there you'd need to use jumbo frames and latency alone will prevent that from even being a consideration. To utilize your line to the fullest extent you'd need multiple clients (computers / devices on your side) making multiple connections to the outside world across a variety of services and servers. This means many threads, many open connections, many states, many many packets streaming over your router all with the overhead of NAT and other firewall inspection rules. All of this requires more processing power to handle all of this information at a rate that lets each of your clients max their speeds and thus your line. Unless you have a dozen clients all of whom are doing lots of heavy downloading at the same time there's little need to actually get a router up near your theoretical max. The R7000 will likely do you fine though you'll see slow downs as you get more and more clients and more and more traffic (it's called dog piling). You'll need serious dedicated hardware to scale up with traffic, think several hundred at a minimum if you're building your own or several thousand if you're getting an off the shelf option."

However when it comes to transferring stuff to and from the NAS then you might actually need 1000mbps to get everything running as fast as it can (this is a bit of a generalisation and depends on your NAS setup, and how many files are accessed at the same time etc etc)  If the NAS/Computer(s) are in the same room it would better to have them plug into a cheap and cheerful Gigabit switch.

This is in a German city with 130,000 people. A few years ago a local subsidiary of the public utility company was founded to provide and expand fiber internet. They definitely have made some good progress, but it is still not available in my part of the town. In addition to that their fastest offering is 100Mbit/s down, 10Mbit/s up. So I'm not really missing out on too much.  The biggest problem, however, are smaller villages, which may have just gotten DSL a few years ago. For some of the people there 20 Mbit/s download is high-speed.  I guess what I'm also trying to say is that Internet speed is one of those things that you are more dissatisfied with if you have to cut back on it.
