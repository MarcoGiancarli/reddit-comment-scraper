miamidolphins,3e2h2d,reaper527,4,Tue Jul 21 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Is there any chance we could sign Mathis to a one year worth a lot of money, so if he didn't pan out, we could still sign Miller and Vernon?  Also, if we were to sign him, could Douglas play RG?"
miamidolphins,3e2h2d,VermontBro,3,Tue Jul 21 15:05:39 2015 UTC,The roll over from this year leaves us 2 million over the cap next year. So in essence we'd have even less room if we sign him this year even a 1 year deal. It's not worth it in the long run.
miamidolphins,3e2h2d,Blacklist3d,6,Tue Jul 21 16:20:13 2015 UTC,See? I barely even understand cap to begin with. Thank you for confusing me even more
miamidolphins,3e2h2d,VermontBro,11,Tue Jul 21 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"Money not used in one year can be rolled over to the next year. This is mostly to give teams flexibility to meet the cap floor. Teams must spend 89% of the total salary cap in any four-year period, and rollover allows them to accomplish this.  Overthecap.com currently lists the Dolphins as having $10MM in cap space this season (a cursory glance suggests they are up-to-date on all our contracts). However, without salary cap rollover, we're already nearly $8MM over a projected $150MM salary cap in 2016. As /u/Blacklist3d suggested, if we roll over all the cap space we have into next season, it means we're right at the projected cap before we even consider signing any free agents or rookies.  We do not have the money to sign Evan Mathis to any kind of deal without making some major changes next year regardless of the duration of Mathis's contract. There are several moves we are very likely to make next year for cap reasons (cutting guys like Dion Jordan, Greg Jennings, Jason Fox, and John Denney) and difficult decisions (Brandon Fields, Cameron Wake, Brent Grimes) that will free up additional cap space, but signing Mathis now makes difficult decisions even more strained."
miamidolphins,3e2h2d,Cidolfus,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:45 2015 UTC,That does make sense. Thank you for the explanation. I was always confused when it came to cap room.

miamidolphins,3e2h2d,Irishman18,3,Tue Jul 21 23:42:59 2015 UTC,He could be what gives us the edge over our division rivals. We'd probably be the best team to at least partially neutralize our opponents' pass rushers.

I lived in Orlando two years ago and the Jags were on over the Phins every time they were at home I believe due to CBS contracts.  You can catch one every once in a while if the times they play don't match up or one is away or something but I wouldn't count on seeing a lot of them on basic cable.

I ended up just heading to this bar called Linksters in downtown Lakeland because they have Sunday Ticket playing all the games on 6-8 different TVs.

It was a three win difference between year one and two. That's pretty big. And putting everything that happened after he left all on him is such a huge amount of speculation.

miamidolphins,3e2pqh,swfl55,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"Cam Cameron is responsible for the worst season in dolphins history. We've changed coaches before and didn't go 1-15. Saban wasn't so good in the NFL that him leaving is going to cause us to go almost undefeating. Shoot, we were below .500 with Saban! And yes I live and let live. It is a game I watch for enjoyment. I don't get so invested in it I wish harm on people, or actively hate someone who has done a tremendous amount of good where he went. And by that I mean in the community, not on the field, though that too. I'm upset for about 30 minutes after the dolphins lose. Then it is back to reality where what they do has no impact on my immediate life.  And no, what I said at the end want necessarily the best. So I do apologize for it. The overall point of it is true though. We don't do it with any other coach."

I was really referring to him saying that his wife did all the communicating with Alabama and forced him into an interview.  No one believes he hadn't already been in talks with Bama himself when he made his infamous press conference.
miamidolphins,3e2pqh,Johansenburg,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"According to the recent biography, he was talking to Chuck Moore, then-Alabama AD Mal Moore's son, about it, yes, but there's a huge difference between talking about a job and actually pursuing it. If anybody offers me a job, I'm listening - it doesn't mean I'm planning to leave.  Stugotz mentioned that he was discussing an extension with Huizenga; does that sound to you like someone with one foot out the door?"

I see 3-1 or 4-0 with Brady because our offense has pretty minimal turnover and should come out hot.  That changes with Garoppolo but honestly BB has the ability to slow games down, keep it to one score and see what happens late in the 4th.

I know this will come off as a homer pick but the fact is that their defense got way worse this offseason and they have a tough schedule.  The Bills and Dolphins both improved to the point where they could win the division, and the Jets have an absurd defense so they won't be pushovers in the 2 games against the Pats.  General predictions I think the playoff seeds are: Colts, Steelers, Broncos, Dolphins, Chargers, Bills Packers, Cowboys, Cardinals, Falcons, Seahawks, Eagles"
miamidolphins,3e324b,Cabphan85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"We win the East but lose to the Pats in the first round. People will criticize Tanny for no killer instinct still b/c no playoff wins, even after his 4200 yd season with 30+TDs <10 ints, with 3 game winning drives during the season.  Will Davis beats out Taylor in training camp and gets 4 ints on the season. Grimes makes another Pro Bowl, but is obviously not the corner he was his first year in MIA.   Parker pulls in 8 TDs but is under 750 yds receiving."

miamidolphins,3dyhh3,Nete88,6,Mon Jul 20 16:40:18 2015 UTC,I personally feel that Ryan Tannehill will exceed expectations this year.
miamidolphins,3dyhh3,PissOnEddieShore,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:55 2015 UTC,I think expectations are so high that if he isn't a top-12 QB this year people will be disappointed. Tannehill is being projected as the 8-10th rated fantasy QB in a lot of the stuff I'm reading. That's pretty high expectations.

miamidolphins,3dzcb2,MG87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. here is an excerpt from the Palm Beach Post, that OP's post conveniently left out:  The time Saban spent in South Florida fell far short of expectations created when Huizenga lured him from LSU with a splashy annual salary of nearly $5 million. Burke cites many incidents, including Saban getting angry because the wrong kind of Little Debbie cakes were stocked in his office as well as shouting matches with defensive players Keith Traylor and Zach Thomas.  Worse was the time Saban stepped over offensive lineman Jeno James, who had collapsed into convulsions and needed to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. Although it might be a stretch to say Saban lost the team over that incident, he clearly earned no points with James’ teammates.  “What about natural human compassion?” former fullback Heath Evans, from King’s Academy, told Burke."
miamidolphins,3dzcb2,katzmandoo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"When James went down a lot of players were down in the hallway. It was a hot, intense practice and most players didn't even know anything was wrong. Saban was one of the first people to visit him in the hospital and stayed with him over night.
