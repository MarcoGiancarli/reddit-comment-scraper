This seems like a pretty reckless statement by Singhal. Do you think he'd suggest we make a move on Aroldis Chapman?"
Nationals,3e39ft,SchweddyBurrito,20,Tue Jul 21 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Talk about reckless, the Reds are looking for a young outfield bat in a swap for Chapman, and Singhal knows that we don't really have any of those to spare. As much as I am loath to participate in the Kimbrel talk, he might be a better fit. As we learn from the Bhagavad Gita, time is the destroyer of all, and we need to accept a second tier reliever like K-Rod or Axford, one that would be willing to pitch the eighth."

Middle relievers are notoriously streaky year over year and were looking at 2020 for India to become a Hindu country.

Nationals,3e4b4z,andrew02020,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Well he's been bouncing back and forth. If I were building a rotation, I'd take him without hesitation."
Nationals,3e4b4z,charliemike,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"I would take him depending on who the alternatives are. He may be an ok #5 if we left him there consistently, but he hasn't looked it so far. Not striking out enough people, and giving up too much hard contact. He's hanging a pitch per at bat."
Nationals,3e4b4z,andrew02020,6,Wed Jul 22 02:41:08 2015 UTC,I suspect fucking with his routine is the reason for this.  He hasn't had a single month this year with a consistent role.
Nationals,3e4b4z,damnatio_memoriae,4,Wed Jul 22 01:34:43 2015 UTC,Yup. Getting Detweilered had to have some effect.

Nationals,3e4b4z,andrew02020,3,Wed Jul 22 01:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think he's the piece that could be moved at the deadline.  Ross has better stuff, making Roark the odd man out."
Nationals,3e4b4z,Matugi1,2,Wed Jul 22 01:33:53 2015 UTC,Shoulda moved him in the offseason when he was worth more. Sending him to the bullpen was a waste.
Nationals,3e4b4z,CornDoggyStyle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:36:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think Rizzo et co anticipated Ross being as good as he has been, otherwise yeah, Roark would've been dealt."

Nationals,3e4b4z,thekyle1591,3,Wed Jul 22 01:33:25 2015 UTC,But it is his fault that he's been very hittable this year.
Nationals,3e4b4z,andrew02020,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:37 2015 UTC,I suspect he'd be more consistent on the mound if his role was more consistent.
Nationals,3e4b4z,damnatio_memoriae,4,Wed Jul 22 01:36:45 2015 UTC,well he's given up a fuck ton of HR's this year
Nationals,3e4b4z,Dmac5797,2,Wed Jul 22 01:34:01 2015 UTC,He hasn't been good but he's been shuffled from BP to the rotation so many times I'm not suprised he hasn't found a rhythm

Nationals,3e43ou,damnatio_memoriae,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:03 2015 UTC,He's also a LHB which theoretically should be better against deGrom. Also he had that dope 2 run homer on Sat

Taylor's defense is REALLY good.  Can Werth do enough damage with the bat to offset the lack of defense?  Do they treat him like a Moorse where you swap in Taylor for defense late in games?

Nationals,3e2y5c,tiny_apt_brewer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:40 2015 UTC,Thought if I took a vacation day I might be able to great seats for super cheap. Nope. The secondary market has had this game as way more expensive than the first two. What gives?
Nationals,3e2y5c,BigE42984,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Camp day.
Nationals,3e2y5c,kmlweather,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:02 2015 UTC,A few weeks ago my dad got us two tickets in section 129. Not sure how much he paid - I'll have to ask. I assume that most of the camps that are there will be up in the higher levels vs down near the field.
Nationals,3e2y5c,ST00PKlD,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:21:51 2015 UTC,What section are you trying to get? They look normal to me...what secondary market are you using?
Nationals,3e2y5c,tiny_apt_brewer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it normal. Take a look at the corner sections, for example.  Cheapest ticket on Seatgeek tomorrow is $27. Go ahead to the next weeknight game (8/3) and it's only $11.    If anything the 12:30pm game should be selling at a discount since so many people have to work. I guess they must be expecting a whole lot of campers."
Nationals,3e2y5c,ST00PKlD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, sorry about that. Weird, maybe the day, time, and team effects the ticket prices. Season Tickets FTW"
Nationals,3e2y5c,swarles123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"For ""everyone"" being at work, it sure is close to being a sellout.  Now it could be the season ticket holder base being higher than in years past.  but I'd say if that were the case , the secondary market would be rather depressed for the game.  But its not.  Generally workday game days , are ""get away"" games.   Since neither the mets or the Nats are traveling far to play tomorrow, its almost as if they did this as a day game just for the camp event.  I prefer less crowded weekday day games myself.  was kind of disappointed this one will be crowded."
Nationals,3e2kwc,strawberryphosphates,17,Tue Jul 21 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"Does Espinosa even count as a reserve player anymore? Because it's definitely him. But I guess everyone pretty much knows that so it's not ""unsung.""  Our outfield would be in trouble without Taylor, like we would have had to make a trade by now and sacrifice prospects.  The most unsung is probably Robinson, who's been doing a decent job holding down 1B, not exactly heroic but getting it done.  Joe Ross for the pitchers."
Nationals,3e2kwc,dcnine,5,Tue Jul 21 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"Espinosa without a doubt.He went into spring training trying to remake his swing,to avoid being traded after Escobar signing..instead he has been clutch,at bat and on field.  Michael Taylor has also been vital with Werth and Span out,but for me,it's  Espinosa."
Nationals,3e2kwc,DCsportsJohnny,10,Tue Jul 21 15:39:42 2015 UTC,If it's not Danny then definitely Clint.
Nationals,3e2kwc,Nanny_McPhee,8,Tue Jul 21 14:41:10 2015 UTC,"Michael (bf)A Taylor Swift has been the guy, no question. He has played gold glove defense, he's stealing bases, launching taters and has been CLUTCH AS HELL. If he can start making more consistent contact and cut down on the k's, he's gonna be an all star in center."

Nationals,3e2kwc,Smokinacesfan55,5,Tue Jul 21 15:32:25 2015 UTC,Robinson is making himself valuable. Solid hitting and decent defense.

Nationals,3e2kwc,c53x12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:54 2015 UTC,He didn't exactly come out of nowhere.  He's been in the Nats system for several years as a highly touted prospect.
Nationals,3e2kwc,ST00PKlD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry I mean't, he could hit a home run at anytime or a nice RBI. He's been with us for a several years"
Nationals,3e2kwc,sbg333,2,Wed Jul 22 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"My vote goes to Danny Espinosa. He's been able to fill in at at multiple positions, which has been invaluable this year. He's always been a plus defender (1st in UZR for 2B http://bit.ly/1OuuPoy) but we're also seeing offensive career numbers in BA, OBP, and SLG http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/e/espinda01.shtml"
Nationals,3e2kwc,diytry,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"Has to be either Uggla or Joe Ross.  Braves game, EOT.  Espi, Robinson, Taylor all have played too much to count as a reserve player.  Espi: 82/91 games Robinson: 66/91 Taylor: 76/91"
Nationals,3e2kwc,youthdecay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:16 2015 UTC,Robinson's a reserve player who hits so well it forced Matt Williams to start him over Tyler Moore.

Nationals,3e0rtw,blueandgold0302,22,Tue Jul 21 02:03:47 2015 UTC,"Clint's hitting .270...I've said it a lot, but I'll say it again: I gave him a lot of shit and gave MW more for playing him (and Rizzo even more for even keeping him on the team), not to mention he plays a brutal left field, but dammit as a LH first baseman he can play."
Nationals,3e0rtw,diytry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again after today, but Clint is a LH TMo with less power and den Dekker is and will be a better choice as the 4th OF and will have similar power to Clint.  I'm tired of hearing how the media thinks Clint Robinson is such a big bopper just because he is a tall, big strong looking guy.  He's a gap power guy."
Nationals,3e0rtw,blueandgold0302,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"Hey I never said Clint had any sort of actual power. He doesn't, but he produces at a decent clip especially for a bench bat forced to play everyday right now.  He's a much more consistent hitter than TMo, and I don't think it's particularly close (and I like TMo, maybe even overly so). Agreed on Den Dekker, if we're forced to use a fourth OF moving into Sept/Oct. I'd rather him play LF than Clint, even if he's not quite as good at the plate (there's no way in hell Den Dekker hits .270 with a decent OBP, and I'm not so sure he has more power)"
Nationals,3e0rtw,diytry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"Well, den Dekker did hit .250 with a .345 OBP (which is more than decent) in about the same number of ABs as Robinson has had so far this year.  den Dekker did this last year with the Mets.  I'm fine with Clint at 1B, and it is needed given Zim's injury and down year.  I just don't think him or TMo should play in the OF this year as we have better inhouse options.    I think Rizzo should go out and get a 1B/LF bat at the trade deadline     as this will be the cheapest way to upgrade this team."
Nationals,3e0rtw,blueandgold0302,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"True, but he was also struggling mightily at AAA this year, and if not for the injury bug likely wouldn't have even been called up until rosters expand in September, if at all. But yeah, I agree with you on both Clint and Moore not playing the OF. I think the LF/1B bench market is pretty thin this year.  Obviously Zobrist is out there as a rumor, and can literally play 6 or 7 positions, but I don't see him being as cheap as everyone makes it seem."
Nationals,3e0rtw,diytry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want Zobrist as his positional flexibility makes him expensive in terms of talent given up.    We really only need a LF/1B type - the other INF positions were hurting only when Yunel was out.    CIN's Jay Bruce would be a decent pickup.

Nationals,3e0rtw,andrew02020,11,Tue Jul 21 02:16:37 2015 UTC,He doesn't even need to hit to provide a ton of value to this team.

Nationals,3e00oe,TotallyAUsername,7,Mon Jul 20 22:21:49 2015 UTC,"According to FanGraphs:   BFA: 14.7 UZR Bryce: 0.0 UZR DSpan: -6.0 UZR   As I said in another thread, I'm bad at statistics, but this just doesn't feel right to me.   Maybe it's cuz I rep his flair, but I feel like even with the injuries DSpan hasn't been a ""Below Average"" outfielder this year."
Nationals,3e00oe,foohbear,8,Tue Jul 21 07:14:37 2015 UTC,Span has range but has a below avg arm - this year his defensive numbers probably look bad because of small sample size due to the DL stints.    I never noticed Span's arm strength concerns revealed by the Saber stats until watching BFA in center this year.
Nationals,3e00oe,diytry,3,Tue Jul 21 10:23:21 2015 UTC,"I'll attempt to answer the question about Bryce. When you think about it, Bryce makes most of his great catches with no one on and the ball rarely finds him in the OF when a runner is at 3rd this season. Actually, not a lot of balls hit to him with runners at second either unless it's a fly ball. People don't run on him very often so his chance for a put out is a little rare as well. I guess it makes sense if you really think about it. But for Span, I agree with u/diytry."
Nationals,3e00oe,Skapes1230,2,Tue Jul 21 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only thing negative for Bryce is his arm which is probably a combination of people being less aggressive running on him, our catchers not being able to catch throws from the outfield, and the fact that he had a lot of off line throws at the beginning of the season."
Nationals,3e00oe,andrew02020,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:42 2015 UTC,Yeah Ramos and Loby have had issues trying to make tags before the ball gets all the way to them. Rushed tags and beginning season throws for Bryce seem pretty logical as to why his UZR is sitting at 0.
Nationals,3e00oe,Skapes1230,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"Outfielders gain UZR if the runner doesn't take an extra base. So his arm is being included, even if he isn't throwing guys out."
Nationals,3e00oe,Skapes1230,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"Just checked, and read a huge article on how it's calculated (extensive to the point of confusion in some areas) and I think you're right. He would get a small amount of positive points for holding runners."
Nationals,3e00oe,cubanimal,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:03 2015 UTC,Everyone I've read that knows way more than I do about defensive metrics says that they are essentially useless with a sample size smaller than 3 seasons.   Unfortunately I'm not smart enough to statistically validate BFA's high number while proving Span's UZR is bullshit.
Nationals,3e00oe,SkinsWiz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"That is correct. I even told someone on this subreddit that you need multiple years of defensive data to have an accurate  understanding of the quality of a player's defense. But what I was trying to get across is that to lead all of baseball in UZR half way through the season requires a lot of talent. This doesn't mean he is the best at defense, but he may very well be."
Nationals,3e00oe,Gondorff777,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:17 2015 UTC,Not gonna lie...a bit surprising. Especially considering this chart:  Defensive Ability   UZR  Gold Glove Caliber  +15  Great         +10  Above Average   +5  Average  0  Below Average   -5  Poor    -10  Awful   -15

Nationals,3e329l,ThePaddingtonBear,5,Tue Jul 21 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. They expect to contend next year and with the departures of Zimmermann and Fister, they will need him. I don't think he's off limits, I just don't think a deal gets done. Mike Rizzo will ask for a lot, as he did with Jordan Zimmermann, and if he doesn't get it, he'll hang on to him."
Nationals,3e329l,DemonFrog,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:39 2015 UTC,It's definitely a long shot. What if they can come to terms with one of Zimmermann or Fister? Does that change the thinking at all? Giolito could conceivably be ready at some point next year as well.
Nationals,3e329l,DemonFrog,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"The ship has sailed on extending Zimmermann. Zimmermann is looking for Lester money and Fister has been bad. Even if you account for guys like Giolito or Joe Ross pitching next year, they need Strasburg."
Nationals,3e329l,MaesterCat,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, Giolito, Ross, and Lopez waiting in the minor leagues and Roark sitting in the pen. This equals Zimmermann and Fister walking at the end of this season, with Strasburg end of next. That 7 year belief for the shelf life of a TJ pitcher limits length."

Nationals,3dzfnn,Skapes1230,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"I believe the X-axis is the total amount of time missed by their players, and the Y-axis is the talent level of the players that have missed time. Basically how many wins they are missing due to injuries over how much raw time they are missing from guys that should be playing."
Nationals,3dzfnn,andrew02020,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit skeptical of the methodology used to quantify player quality, though.    Our TMITT metrics base the quality of a player on their average at bats (for TMITT-batting and variants) or innings played per game (for TMITT-pitching and TMITT-fielding and variants)."
Nationals,3dzfnn,Qwerksss,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"I went over this when someone posted this in /r/baseball, but look into the stat posted on the y-axis. Its basically useless. This is a terrible stat that I don't really think does a good job at adjusting for the quality of player injured. According to this stat the Phillies missing Ben Revere would be a bigger impact than the Diamondbacks losing Goldy."
Nationals,3dzfnn,feed_me_muffins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:35:07 2015 UTC,Oh so they don't adjust it on avg player performance and impact.. What's the point of this stupid chart then?!

Nationals,3dxz32,aspirer42,11,Mon Jul 20 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"NERDGASM INCOMING - So it's a common trope in the Star Wars canon that Stormtroopers can't hit shit, based on their effectiveness in the movies, which makes Ben Keonbi's line that ""only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise"" an out-and-out laugher.  But think about it - in the very first scene, where Stormtroopers board the Tantive IV (Princess Leia's consular ship), they're pretty badass, conducting a proper boarding after killing the defending security forces almost out of hand.  Then we see them missing Han as he makes the getaway in Mos Eisley, but he's a notorious smuggler and they're a backwoods garrison (who know Han has worked for the local crime boss, Jabba the Hutt).  Once we hit the Death Star, Stormtrooper competence takes a nosedive - they couldn't hit a phone booth from the inside.  But we get a revelation after the getaway.  It's a ruse!  Grand Mofff Tarkin and Vader reveal that they've been let go, with a homing device on board!  The rest of the movies follow a similar pattern - when they need to (Hoth), Stormtroopers are awesome at their jobs.  But when they're dealing with our main characters, they're almost invariably under orders to keep a high value target alive for one reason or another.  They're not bad shots, they're faking it so the Master Plan can go off Just As Planned.  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2013/04/were-the-stormtroopers-under-orders-to-let-the-heroes-escape/  http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/03/13/the-real-reason-stormtroopers-never-hit-their-target-they-re-not-trying-to-2767665?lt_source=external,manual"

Nationals,3dz1cc,andrew02020,17,Mon Jul 20 18:09:54 2015 UTC,Glad to see Treinen sent down.  Doesn't matter how good your velocity or break are if every third pitch is right down the middle.
Nationals,3dz1cc,schwoogiejoe24,5,Mon Jul 20 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Well ...maybe I'm  wrong..I still believe Treinen can be a starter  in the big leagues.He can hit 97,has a lot of pitches..But,it took me years to give up on Henry Rodriguez,ya know?"
Nationals,3dz1cc,DCsportsJohnny,3,Mon Jul 20 20:45:10 2015 UTC,"H-Rod had a lot farther to go to be an effective major leaguer than Treinen does. Treinen is on the cusp, he just needs to use a develop his changeup a little bit to get lefties out."
Nationals,3dz1cc,DCsportsJohnny,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:17 2015 UTC,I agree..just wistful reminiscing
Nationals,3dz1cc,purplepenned,10,Mon Jul 20 22:08:50 2015 UTC,I thought Werth was starting his AAA rehab today and was looking good. Does this mean there was a setback?
Nationals,3dz1cc,purplepenned,8,Mon Jul 20 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I think his DL is still retroactive, so if it's not already up than it should be soon. This is just to clear space."
Nationals,3dz1cc,Boymankid,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:29 2015 UTC,sounds reasonable to me. But we will probably have to clear space on the 40-man after Werth comes back
Nationals,3dz1cc,purplepenned,5,Mon Jul 20 18:14:07 2015 UTC,Yeah. My money is on Martin or Davis.
Nationals,3dz1cc,ZonaPunk,5,Mon Jul 20 18:17:49 2015 UTC,Is the 60 day retroactive? Because if so then they can still bring him back since its been more than 60 days
Nationals,3dz1cc,damnatio_memoriae,7,Mon Jul 20 18:13:46 2015 UTC,Kolko just confirmed (ALSO OMG MASN DAN IS BACK)
Nationals,3dz1cc,ben29,4,Mon Jul 20 18:30:39 2015 UTC,Werth can be brought back at anytime but the Nats will need to clear a roster spot.
Nationals,3dz1cc,Arhod009,4,Mon Jul 20 19:28:28 2015 UTC,Right.  Moving him to the 60-day DL simply delays the need.

Nationals,3dz1cc,JohnnysSilverFox,7,Tue Jul 21 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's one way to get MW to stop using him in high leverage situations. But what does that say about MW that the guy who was apparently the last man in the bullpen, is the one he's choosing to use in high leverage situations?"
Nationals,3dz1cc,FloatAround,5,Mon Jul 20 18:23:46 2015 UTC,Who ever said he was the last man in the bullpen? I think that designation would go to one of our LOOGYs. I think the last man in our bullpen is Solis. Treinen actually has back of the bullpen potential and has shown it many times. His issue is that he can't get through his bad outings.
Nationals,3dz1cc,FloatAround,4,Mon Jul 20 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"Treinen as is still provides value as a inning eater or a situational right hander, but yeah if he wants to stick as a high leverage guy he'll need to work on consistency and command."
Nationals,3dz1cc,CoachKevinCH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"If he got sent down to make up room for the de los Santos, then he was the last man in the bullpen because he was the next to get sent down. He might have the potential to be an 8th or 9th inning guy, but Rizzo and the FO felt like he was at or near the bottom of the depth chart."
Nationals,3dz1cc,CWAnik,6,Mon Jul 20 20:03:27 2015 UTC,MW hasn't used Treinen in high leverage situations in a while (unless forced to).
Nationals,3dz1cc,appleapple123123,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"Ummm, 1-0 games are high leverage situations."
Nationals,3dz1cc,blueandgold0302,3,Mon Jul 20 20:01:15 2015 UTC,Not as high leverage as they could be. Winning 1-0 or tied with men on is high leverage. Down 1-0 with the bases empty in the 9th is medium leverage
Nationals,3dz1cc,blueandgold0302,4,Mon Jul 20 20:19:26 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks this means Rendon is getting activated?
Nationals,3dz1cc,thekyle1591,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:58 2015 UTC,We already knew Rendon was getting activated. I don't see what that has to do with sending treinen down and calling up a AA guy though.
Nationals,3dz1cc,captainchaos47,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"Just the fact that two spots were created and only one was filled. I have not seen an official source from the team stating rendon is being a activated so it's worth talking about.  Edit: and if this lineup holds , rendon won't be activated. So we will have an extra spot if no other moves are made."
Nationals,3dz1cc,powerslavecolin,3,Mon Jul 20 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't believe two spots were created. The DL move freed up space on the 40 man, not the 25 man roster. Someone on the 25 man will have to be optioned to create room when Rendon is activated."
Nationals,3dz1cc,WarriorHealer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:34 2015 UTC,Only one spot was created. Werth wasn't occupying a 25 man roster spot. He's been on the DL. They moved Werth off the 40 man roster to clear a spot for De Los Santos and then sent Treinen to Syracuse to clear a 25 man roster spot. Only 1 spot was cleared.

I will stop wondering about Chapman when one of the following things happen : the trade deadline passes, we trade for another high profile reliever, or he gets traded to another contender. I trust Rizzo more than anyone else in the sports world, and he works magic. What's to say we don't work out a three team trade? Plus, everyone has a price. Unless your name is Walt Jocketty, you don't really know what your plans for Chapman are.   Let's not forget, many teams have a big outfield bat. And I would bet the majority of those teams would be interested in many of our top prospects. Rizzo is not afraid to work out a three team trade."

Nationals,3dyw9z,whiteonbothsides,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:13 2015 UTC,We don't need a closer.  We need middle relievers and a bat or two.  We can get the bats as guys come off the DL and get their grooves back.  Not sure how to shore up the middle of the bullpen.
Nationals,3dyw9z,angrypinoy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"How do we know Rizzo even wants Chapman? Maybe he has his eye on someone who's productive and cheaper. Rizzo is a good GM because he's smart, and can get production out of cheap players. It's not like he's just that much better than the other GMs that they just give him whatever he wants."
Nationals,3dyw9z,andrew02020,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"He does, Rizzo is REALLY HIGH on guys who he likes. He personally drafted Scherzer in Arizona and believed in him; one of the reasons why we chose to give him a big contract instead of Zimmermann. Nats came in 2nd place in Chapman sweepstakes when he defected from Cuba. Tldr- Rizzo loves Chapman, price may not be feasible"

Nationals,3e04l6,FloatAround,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:46 2015 UTC,I wish him the best. He was an above average closer here who is unfairly Shit on in this sub and many other forums. I still think he would have made a solid 7th or 8th inning guy has he been willing to. Our pen would have been far more stable with him.
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,4,Tue Jul 21 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"For a $1-2 mil deal,sure. Why do you think it's  more than halfway through season,and someone is just NOW giving him a job? Reasons fans and papers shit on Soriano.  1..$28 mil deal that blew up our pitching costs..not his fault,Ruzzo willing to outbid all if MLB..Who could blame him for taking the $?  2-Messed up both Storen and Clippard rotation..could you see Yankees taking Mariano Rivera out after a big blown playoff save_and he had a few..including 7th game of 2001 World series..and giving his replacement a contract worth 8 times his salary?  3-He was a rude interview..language problem? Been in league for 13+ years.now on his 7TH team..consistently(in seattle,atlanta,Tampa,NY.and DC)rude to reporters and media..why do papers shit on him? Why do you think Ray Knight,who loves ALL the Nats players,was so vocally anti Soriano?  4-Like Jantsen,he was a pitcher w high 80s,low 90s stuff..control pitcher,spotting the ball..NOT closer material,and he often walked guys,had 20+ pitch saves,second year,began to lose games that way,and often blew up great starts,where Nats would have to win the games after he had blown up..not a loss,not a save either.  5-All that,and pulling out his shirt..what's  NOT to like?"
Nationals,3e04l6,diytry,4,Tue Jul 21 06:20:34 2015 UTC,"Mo was an established star closer (multiple AS selections), and had already won a WS MVP award prior to the 2001 WS blown save.  He only had that one other bad playoff series when the Red Sox did that miraculous 0-3 climb and finally went on their way to reverse the curse.  Storen was young and not as established as he is now - and now he is certainly not as established as Mariano was in 2001.  It's if the Nats got Chapman tomorrow and decided to bump Storen down to the 8th inning (Chapman is > Soriano from a few years ago, 2015 Storen > 2012 Storen) - controversial, but that's a move you do.  After yet another shaky outing by Janssen (from highlights) last night over the Mets, I still think he's not the solution for the 8th."
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,3,Tue Jul 21 10:38:30 2015 UTC,"We will have to agree to disagree.No question Rivera is the greatest closer of all time,not comparing him to Storen,only the respective roles on team.Remember,Rivera was set up man for John Wetteland for a couple of years.  Look at his numbers vs. Storen over first 4 years,even with Storen deposed  by Soriano..Storen actually stacks up pretty well,and in 2001, Rivera was in his eighth year in rotation.  I would NEVER embrace Soriano,for all the reasons I listed.I amn sure you are not comparing him to super gracious,spiritual,exemplary teammate and media darling Mariano,either.  If it's  him or Jantsen  (who I sure as hell am not that impressed with..loved Clippard) at this point,I'd  be OK with either..at a low/minimal salary..but given their respective personalities,probably still go with Jantsen.  Maybe you get that I have a bias towards our own,homegrown players. It's  not easy for me to embrace players who Nats pay more to for feats they performed for others,rather than pay our own guys(Scherzer vs, Jordan Zimmerman...Werth vs.Ryan Zimmerman..Edwin Jackson & Dan Haren vs. Detweiler,John Lannan,et. al.)I'd  sure hope when it's  time to pony up for Strasburg and Bryce,we go that route,and NOT  another Soriano."
Nationals,3e04l6,FloatAround,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"Personalities won't win championships. We had a lot of likeable guys when we went 7 years without a winning record. Very few relief pitchers spend their entire careers with the same team. Mo is the exception to this rule, not the standard. You are making it very hard to try and debate with you when you essentially said you would rather have bad players on your team vs elite ones, just because we drafted them. In the case of Jordan Zimmermann, a lot of people have speculated he just does not want to spend the majority of his career in DC. Players hardly ever have the happy marriage with the team that the fans think or want them to have.  PS - Janssen is getting paid more than Sori is. Almost all of Sori's contract is incentive based. Even if he hits all of his incentives he will still make less than Janssen."
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"Last thing,I will let it go.I think personalities DO help win championships,Most winning teams point to team chemistry.SanFran Giants this year in Sports Illustrated,post season look at Mgr Bochy and front office spoke directly to that,using oersonalities and personal histories as to their roster construction,as did MOST teams that were in playoffs(KC,Balt.Cardinals).  There gave been teams that won with scrapping.fighting teams..Yanks of 70s- 80s w Reggie,Jordan Bulls.But most have good chemistry.As for Jordan Z,we NEVER negotiated with him in goid faith<not even as much as Desmond>,he has stated he'd  have preferred to stay here.Not dating we had to pay him Max money,but still."
Nationals,3e04l6,diytry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you are talking about.  You compared pulling Storen as the closer after the blown Cardinals series with hypothetically pulling Mariano after his blown game 7 vs the Diamondbacks.  It does not matter that Mariano was a setup man for Wettland for a few years.  At the end of the 2001 WS, Mariano was an established star closer with multiple All Star selections and a WS MVP!  This was early/mid career Mariano and he was already a much, much more accomplished closer than Storen then.  Your comparison does not work because in 2012 Storen was an unproven closer.  In 2015 Storen would still be labelled an unproven playoff closer.  Replacing Storen and replacing 2001 Mariano is not the same thing at all."
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"Jeez...guess I have to spell this out. Again,NOT rivera of 2001(used that as an example of blown saves Rivera had,not THE blown save) Comparing the Rivera in his early career(maybe first 2-3 years with Yanks..get it? with Storen of his FIRST FULL YEAR IN MLB..get it?)  What if Yankees,after Rivera's  FIRST FULL YEAR IN MLB,after a great year did to him,what Nats did to Storen.  (remember Storen saving 43 games in 2012 ? striking out side in 9th before Werth walked us off against Cards in NLDS game 4?)  First full year of closing,Rivera had 43 saves.,BTW.  Say Yanks then brought in a new closer,who didn't  have nearly as good numbers,and paid him 8 times what Rivera got .  (And also,please remember,in Soriano we paid this to a guy,who in his best year didn't have numbers as good as Storen in 2012,got it?)  Would Rivera have prospered as much? And baseball fans all over would nod,as we always did,and say""that's  the Yankees for ya..spending big  $ on a vet rather than using their young guys"" Let's  not be Yankee-like,please.  So..to clarify,as I am clearly not communicating well..  1-Not comparing rookie Storen of 2012  to 8 year+ vet &HOF closer  Rivera of  2001.Rivera of  1997,OK.Not saying as good as,but for comparisons sake,get it?  2- not comparing Rafael Soriano to Jantsen..do not particularly care for either guy in relief,got it?  3-Always want Nats to WIN..hell i'd  root for Pol Pot if he could close out games or get a clutch hit with RISP.  4-Would prefer to win,for long term reasons,with as many of guys we brought up vs. High paid guys who performed their amazing feats for other teams first.I know and appreciate that that is almost impossible to do, we've  had lots of guys who came in and have been valuable,who I love.  Scherzer is as good a teammate as anyone we've  had on team,love Span.Werth,LaRoche,Escobar,...just prefer as many homegrown guys as we can get..it can be done..Royals of 2014..almost entirely homegrown,get it?"
Nationals,3e04l6,diytry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"Well, you're not communicating well because your analogy is bad.  Mariano was a starter in his first year in the MLB.  And he was signed as a 21 yo international free agent, not a 1st round pick as a closer - which, imo, is a bad use of a 1st round pick no matter how good Storen is right now."
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"Oh My God! I'm  gonna give up. I clearly should have picked another closer,whose stats EXACTLY PARALLEL Drew's. Even though I tried to make this as analogous as possible,spelled out that I am NOT comparing Drew to Rivera,(3 times? 4?)and asking you to visualize  the same treatment to Rivera if he was treated as Storen was after  great first year as Nats closer,it's  clearly too tough a concept for this group to comprehend.  Me,I blame Fox News,dumbing down the world.  ,Forget it.Rafael Soriano was the greatest closer in Nats history.Nats should have paid him MORE than $28 mil for two years.Storen's regression had NOTHING TO DO with the demotions.  Nats should have brought Soriano back.  Nats should go exclusively for pricey free agents,and only bring up guys like Harper and Strasburg.  Chemistry and ability for players who spend 8 months together is completely overrated,and having moribund assholes on the team is a good thing,especially if they are closers.  Getting along with beat writers and media personnel assigned to your team,in ANY professional sport,is completely unneccessary.And if they shit on you in every town,THEY are the assholes.,  While we're  at it..working slowly,late in games is GOOD for the defense behind you,and if your teamnates make an occassional error or misplay behind you.it's  OK to glare at them.and later mention it in your grudging,occassional post game interviews..none after losses,of course."

Nationals,3e04l6,FloatAround,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are trying to say. First off, the majority of the money is deferred. Sori will get something like 2 million a year from us for 7 or 8 years , so if you were implying that we were limited due to his payroll hit that is not true.  Second, if by ""messed up"" drew pitching in the 9th and Clip pitching in the 8th means they did not pitch in that order anymore, you would be correct. Clip pitched the 8th and Sori pitched the 9th. You really seem to assume that the reason for Drew's struggles in 2013 are related to the demotion - don't assume that and dont try to make it that simple. His issues seemed more mechanical than anything else and I have no doubt he would have had a similar season if he was pitching the 9th.  No one is in the clubhouse , and many players from our own clubhouse seemed to get along with Sori just fine. Why would so many people start doing the untuck with him? Others have spoken in his defense before as well.   You are actually going to try and criticism him for playing for multiple teams? That's the life of a late inning reliever. Teams have new, cheap talent all the time come through the system, and bullpens are always unsteady. Pitching multiple places (some of his stops were via trade as well ) is a compliment, not an insult.    The ship has clearly sailed. Sori wears a cubs jersey now. You can diminish his performance here as much as you like, but he was a very solid closer for the better part of two years. Let's just hope he is not closing any games against us in October."
Nationals,3e04l6,DCsportsJohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"I like that you are loyal to Soriano.I also appreciate you sticking up for him.I wanted him to succeed when he pitched here,just grew tired of all his baggage BS. I DO hope he is pitching against us in October,though.I'd  love our chances.There's  a reason his salary is almost 40% incentives( pro rated $1.75mil salary,$1 mil incentives)..NOT suppirting Jantsen,just anti-Rafael.BTW,Soriano is,thinking about it,the ONLY Nats player I'd  root against..typically root for ALL our departed Washington players to do well.  As to nice guys vs. assholes,we did have some nice guys on the losing teams,another good reason to like those 100 loss a year teams.We also had a few knuckleheads,all of whom were eventually purged(Alfonso Soriano,Nyjer Morgan, Lastings Milledge,Jose Guillen,etc...Jeez,some people would put Bryce there,I guess..not me,he's  my favorite.)  But, after  Nats turned corner in 2011,added talented young players,for the last 4-5 years,mostly harmonious good chemistry rosters,which Soriano did NOT fit.I am not making this stuff up,do a google search on Rafael and his relations with teammates on all the teams he played on.  As for others on Nats pulling shirts,of course all of them,and me,wanted Soriano to succeed. If you could  ask them,I think most would rather see Drew get those saves.. based on their reactions since Drew took job back last year,sure looks happier than with Rafael,maybe I am just imagining it. Can you see anybody hugging Soriano? Watch how many guys hug Drew after saves.Little shit,I know,but still.....  Lastly,I know Jantsen makes more than Rafael.I am not supporting Jantsen,would have  preferred we had Stammen,Clippard,Thornton,Solis, Rivero, Barrett.etc. pitching eighth before Jantsen,who reminds me  LOT of Rafael. Same soft stuff aiming  for spots,and very erratic."

Nationals,3dud28,punchandrip,20,Sun Jul 19 18:52:53 2015 UTC,Unless something changes I'd strongly consider Espi at short when Rendon returns. I'm not sure this team can accomplish its goals with this version of Desmond in the lineup.

Nationals,3dud28,joedleonardi,7,Sun Jul 19 16:33:00 2015 UTC,It's always been kinda odd that Desmond plays SS while Espinosa plays 2B since Espinosa is clearly the better fielder.  Has it all been just to protect Desmond's ego?
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,16,Sun Jul 19 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Espi can play pretty much anywhere, while Desi is a SS only.  If Espi plays SS, Desi rides the pine, and he's (usually) too good a hitter to just drop like that."

Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry,he is NOT  a good hitter this year,and 90+ games in,looks like he won't improve.Has fallen into horrible habits..doesn't  appear to be either capable of changing or accepting coaching ,and when Rendon gets back,he needs to sit.At this point,Espi is a better shortstop. Have Rendon go to third,have either Escobar or Espi at short,other goes to second.You might recall.Escobar was originally slotted to take over second..Thank God for Danny's  renaissance,we'd  really be in trouble.  (F P called Desi  out yesterday,albeit low key on how many ROUTINE  THROWS  he has dropped),along with the 21 errors,.200 and dropping average.I'd  like to see us trade for a bat,but if we DON'T (and this was our issue last NLDS..clutch (RISP)hitting,NOT pitching)then we can't afford  another weak bat in this lineup,Max Scherzer last 4 games..1-3 we scored 3 runs on those 4 games  ..3 in the win vs Baltimore.  You can live with losing to Kerahaw,Greinke,but we do this way too ofter against so so pitchers.Lineup is depleted,but I worry about 3 guys coming back all iver 30,10+ years in bigs,with recurring injury issues.  Let's  NOT  be the Phillies and find ourselves in a few years old and injured.Get a young bat with pop,and protect Harper for a few years."
Nationals,3dud28,DCsportsJohnny,2,Mon Jul 20 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, he hasn't been good this year, that's why I said ""(usually)"".  He won the Silver Slugger last year, for crying out loud, so I can understand why the coaching staff wanted to give him a chance to pull out of it.  You can check my posting history over the past little bit, I'm not a huge Desmond defender, I'm just explaining why I think the coaches left Desi in at SS when Espi is a better fielder.   You might recall.Escobar was originally slotted to take over second.   Yes, after a full spring of learning to play the position.  SS is Escobar's regular position, so moving him to the other side of the infield requires effectively re-learning how to play the game (body mechanics and muscle memory are backwards, assignments are different, etc.).  My personal opinion is that the ""by the numbers"" call is, when Rendon gets back, put him at 3B, move Escobar to SS, and leave Espi at 2B.  I don't think we'll trade Desmond for a bat, because 1)there's too much hit to clubhouse morale to not only bench your struggling clubhouse leader, but to trade him, and 2)we wouldn't get anything for him anyway since his year to date has been trash so his value is depleted.  Your ""young bat with pop""?  That's probably Taylor.  He's maturing right in front of us, and while he's no Bryce, he's definitely capable of power, and the more MLB at bats he gets, the better he'll be sooner.  Not to mention Trea Turner in a couple of years (Escobar is the bridge guy between Desi and Turner).  We need a 2B, but hell, we might just keep Espi for a year or so and see if this year is just a fluke or an actual turnaround.  Your fears of becoming the Phillies are groundless.  There's too much talent on the young side of the team and in the farm system for us to realistically be 30 games under .500 at the break in the next five years.  Injuries happen (oh, how we know they happen), but that's not really something you can help."
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"I hope you're  right about Phillies thing.My best friend is a Philly boy.Followed them,and saw them staying too long with aging stars(Howard.Utley, Rollins),signing them to huge contracts(Lee,Hamels.Howard),dealing away young players(Pence).  Much as I love Scherzer,I think like Verlander,and Kershaw,we may live to regret that contract. We are sure as hell not getting value on Ryan Zimmerman.or Werth(I know,face of franchise,& the guy needed to show Nats meant business) and if this continues..well.that's  why I worry.  You don't have to sell me on Taylor,love the guy,have posted a lot of love for Michael,but he is a year away,at least,from a guy to protect Harper. I mean a young established OF w average and pop to play with Harper and Taylor.  But..guys over 30,with a history of injuries,historically do NOT get better.._(Span.Werth,Zimmerman). So I can see Phillies decline there.One of the reasons  I fell in love with Nats was us being young.cost controlled,and well run,but while we keep rolling in pitchers,and even infielders,what OTHER  power  hitters have we developed or drafted (Tyler Moore?steven sousa?)  Rizzo  just drafted three outfielders,but at this point,with Jordan Zimmerman and Fister probably leaving,along with Desi,and giving that  contract to Max,I believe we need to make that move now.  Lastly,ask yourself this? How many ganes did we lose this year due to no hitting and  how many to bad pitching?Bullpen hasn't  been great,but most of those bullpen losses came failing to hold 1,2 run leads.  Enjoyed your posts,I went to Senator games,and 10-15 per year since Nats came back,half season package this year,believe in and love Nats,and Rizzo."
Nationals,3dud28,nguyenqh,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"But he's played at 2B for nearly his entire Major League career, I would say he's more comfortable there at this stage of his career"
Nationals,3dud28,youthdecay,7,Sun Jul 19 16:43:37 2015 UTC,Honestly you can plug him anywhere and can expect him to do his thing. He's just that good at fielding. He played outfield and first base this year for christ's sake. The guy is just adaptable af.
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:45 2015 UTC,He's the rich man's Kevin Frandsen.
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,4,Mon Jul 20 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with this.  Escobar was Desi's replacement after this year anyway, just go ahead and move it up half a season.  The question is, will Matt make the ""by the numbers"" play, or keep Desi in for morale reasons since he's widely considered to be a clubhouse leader?"
Nationals,3dud28,theOnlyGuyInTheRoom,3,Sun Jul 19 16:13:15 2015 UTC,I think as of now Desi basically has a week or so to show improvement. If he's still hovering .200 with no power and no signs he'll improve then Matt's hand is forced
Nationals,3dud28,shanpd,7,Sun Jul 19 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, and he's got to do that against the best pitching we've seen in awhile."
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:51 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer  EDIT: This entire year Ive been rooting for Desi to come back and I truly hope he does but 1/2 the year is gone Desi has been healthy and is showing no signs of improving.
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:32 2015 UTC,"Desmond is one of my favorite Nats of all time and I agree, im rooting for him to come back and have a good year, but at some point you just can't justify him in the lineup over Espinosa/Escobar"
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"It's not just the clubhouse leader thing; although, that is a big part of it.  Desmond has a history of being MUCH better than this.  As long as the Nats are in 1st place, why not give him time to break out of what everyone hopes is just a very long slump."
Nationals,3dud28,FloatAround,8,Sun Jul 19 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but at what point is it not just a common slump anymore?  We're halfway through the season, and he's approaching full-season error totals and looks completely lost at the plate.  He's always been streaky and takes a while to get hot (""April Desi"" is a thing), but has a bad stretch ever really lasted (most of) half a year before?"
Nationals,3dud28,istlion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:54 2015 UTC,We need a real baseball geek to give us a full rundown on how often a player goes from something like Top 3 at his position one season to dead last at his position the next season.   Does it happen (without injury)?  How likely is it that he bounces back?  Someone surely has run these numbers.
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, that would be interesting, but man, that'd be a ton of number crunching.  Somebody could probably start by pulling the top five dWAR players from each season and looking at their dWAR for the following season and two to three seasons after, but then you'd have to adjust for a ton of things like injuries, contract incentives, etc."
Nationals,3dud28,AStrangeDay,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"But the signs have been there all along. He is in a multi season trend of hitting for a lower average, walking less, and striking out way more. This has come to a head. His contact at this point is so poor that the power he has is worthless. I have been concerned about this for a few years and everyone Shit on me for it. I am not surprised at this at all. I used to say he was a more athletic Adam Dunn. I am not so sure about that anymore."
Nationals,3dud28,Muddywaters22,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:46 2015 UTC,How much more time do you want?  Another 25 games? 30 games?
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,3,Sun Jul 19 17:19:16 2015 UTC,I think they'll bench him when Rendon comes back unless he gets hot.
Nationals,3dud28,nguyenqh,2,Sun Jul 19 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Now that Tony might be back tomorrow we'll see, Desi did nothing this series to show improvement so we will see what Williams decides"
Nationals,3dud28,nightstryker,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:00 2015 UTC,He's been given 89 games.
Nationals,3dud28,andrew02020,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I honestly think that it may be more a health issue with Escobar than anything. Escobar may be more protected at 2nd, and espi may have to fill in at SS for the time being. I'd rather see Escobar at SS, but with Rendon rehabbing at 3B, I'm assuming Desmond is going to the bench."
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,2,Sun Jul 19 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"This comes back to the ""can Escobar actually play 2B"" question.  I know the Nats picked him up to do it, but that was supposed to be after spending all spring training learning the position.  Since Escobar's natural position is SS, moving to 2B makes the entire field play backwards for him, so he'll have to basically re-learn body mechanics, positioning, assignments, etc.  I'm in the ""Escobar shouldn't move to 2B"" camp because of all that."
Nationals,3dud28,brandonw49,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Escobar should stay at 3rd, Espi at SS, and Rendon at 2nd"
Nationals,3dud28,SewenNewes,3,Sun Jul 19 17:31:03 2015 UTC,I think the powers that be decided 2B was too much lateral movement for Rendon coming off the quad injury?  Don't want to re-injure him (again).
Nationals,3dud28,dupontcircle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:13 2015 UTC,I think that's just for his rehab assignment.
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's easier on everyone if you move Rendon back to 3B, Danny to 2B, and put Escobar at SS.  That's where each of them has played for their ML careers and probably where they're most comfortable, although I know that each can play at least 2 positions."
Nationals,3dud28,damnatio_memoriae,12,Sun Jul 19 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"I don’t want to sign a deal — and this isn’t to say they’ve offered me this — but I don’t want to sign a deal that is so bad that a future shortstop gets screwed because I signed a terrible deal. I’m not going to be that guy, that kink in the chain.    -Ian Desmond    It's possible that future shortstops will look at what happened to Desmond and just go ahead and take the a deal that might be a little below the most they could possibly get let themselves get screwed."
Nationals,3dud28,SewenNewes,7,Sun Jul 19 16:35:53 2015 UTC,I'm so interested in seeing what he gets paid on the FA market this off-season. If he ever gets back to form some team could be in for a steal.
Nationals,3dud28,Iamtheshamus,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"Eh, he was 100% right at the time. Every player owes it to their union to not lower the market value for their position. It just sucks for him that he is losing himself money now."
Nationals,3dud28,istlion,5,Sun Jul 19 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Huh? No, that's stupid. He doesn't owe anyone anything. Taking a hometown discount is stupid but these idiot players often vastly misunderstand risk and how to discount future contracts based on risk, and what is fair, and proper risk strategies."
Nationals,3dud28,Boymankid,6,Sun Jul 19 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"Think if he had been a FA after last season instead, he would've got much more than Hanley Ramirez and he would've been right to bet on himself. It was a bet that you'll often see guys make and in this case it isn't working for Desmond, but it has definitely worked for guys in the past.   Max Scherzer declined a similar extension from Detroit, bet on himself, and landed a huge contract."
Nationals,3dud28,damnatio_memoriae,3,Sun Jul 19 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"The point is, for every Scherzer, there's a Desmond.  This happens all the time, and it could be avoided if more players did what Trout, Tulo, and Giancarlo did.  Make a marginal sacrifice in exchange for minimized risk.  Desi could've done that, but he felt like he owed somebody some unfounded loyalty.  He should've been loyal to himself, and now he'll basically end up with nothing -- and no one will even owe him an apology for that."
Nationals,3dud28,andrew02020,0,Mon Jul 20 06:17:03 2015 UTC,The players aren't idiots. Even guys like Stanton are currently underpaid. No one is going to games to see old men own. They go to see the players play. The owners are the ones vastly overpaid.

Nationals,3ducns,Nanny_McPhee,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:03 2015 UTC,Blake has had maybe 3-4 impressive outings. There is a real reason he has a 4.39 ERA. He's not a good pitcher. Solis can at least locate the fastball and strike people out.
Nationals,3ducns,thekyle1591,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed with you if you had said Rivero but Blake has the highest ceiling in our bullpen. No way Solis is better. Blake has had a hell of a lot more than 3 or 4 impressive outings and when it's there, he's flat out dominant."
Nationals,3ducns,andrew02020,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:01 2015 UTC,"I don't give a shit about ceiling. H-rod had a high ceiling too. Blake is like Blevins in a way. If he's against 3 RH in a row, he looks good. If he faces any lefties, he is destroyed. He's too inconsistent to ever be a good bullpen arm, let alone dominant. Maybe if he gets a change, but I doubt it."
Nationals,3ducns,thekyle1591,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:11 2015 UTC,He can be a righty specialist then. But this game wasn't terrible. When a ground ball pitcher gets groundballs than you can't blame him. He kept it on the ground and our defense is awful. Has been all season.
Nationals,3ducns,andrew02020,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, this game is exactly why Treinen needs to be sent to AAA for awhile. He cannot strike lefties out. Had a .907 OPS allowed coming in against lefties. He allows hard contact very frequently. People should not be hitting the ball this hard against a power sinker.   Bottom line is the dude has a 4.39 ERA. He needs to work on some stuff. Desmond too. It wasn't below Storen and it shouldn't be below them. And like Drew, I have no doubt a few days in triple A should work wonders."
Nationals,3ducns,thekyle1591,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:09:46 2015 UTC,Your acting like we have guys to replace them with... We don't. We just need to use him differently. And when you throw 98 if people make contact they will hit it hard. Which is why he was better as a starter and was throwing 95. More time for the sinker to drop. More control. But if you haven't seen the dominance from him when he's been on you aren't watching enough because he's been dominant more times than not.

Nationals,3ducns,thekyle1591,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:56 2015 UTC,Turner's and Pederson's were both weakly hit that just found holes. Puig was one that Escobar should have had. Ethier was really the only person that half inning that actually got a hit that wasn't a hit because it just happened to find a hole.
Nationals,3ducns,feed_me_muffins,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"You're gonna get unlucky. Shit happens. But you can't just roll over. Yes Yunel missed it, but that ball was smoked. He can't strike people out unless he has his A+ stuff, which is the big problem."

Nationals,3ducns,andrew02020,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"He's a big boy. He gets it. On another note, he needs to be benched when healthier players return. It's about to be time to get serious about having the best players in the line up."

Nationals,3ducns,purplepenned,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"Within a week or so I would imagine, biggest thing in rehab games is playing 9 innings and then playing back to back"

Nationals,3ducns,Gummy_Joe,4,Sun Jul 19 20:00:19 2015 UTC,Imagine if Ramos threw a semi catchable relay at home. It'd still be 0-0.
Nationals,3ducns,thekyle1591,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"See, if Harper hadn't been given that bs zone, we'd have two on, two out with...Ian Desmond at the plate.  Okay, so maybe it didn't end up mattering."
Nationals,3ducns,Gummy_Joe,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I check back on the game after an hour and it's still Greinke and it's still 1-0"
Nationals,3ducns,ParCorn,4,Sun Jul 19 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Ramos is 2 for his last 24 and 13 for 68
Nationals,3ducns,ben29,3,Sun Jul 19 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Still better than Desmond.  Its not just missing regulars. Its also that the regulars we do have are having career worst seasons.
Nationals,3ducns,feed_me_muffins,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:20 2015 UTC,Escobar and Espinosa are posting career bests though.

Nationals,3du89u,CornDoggyStyle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:00:53 2015 UTC,TIL Zimm is 1-for-8 in SB attempts in the minors.
Nationals,3dx1t1,HeatRavensCubs,4,Mon Jul 20 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"As a prospect he was hailed as a power pitcher with great command and the ability to throw off speed pitches for strikes. He lived up to everything we wanted in his debut, striking out 14 batters, a team record at that time. His rookie season ended early due to injury and he required Tommy John surgery. In 2012, he was an all-star but was given an innings limit and was taken off the active roster for precautionary reasons and didn't pitch in the playoffs. His 2013 and 2014 seasons were great but with expectations through the roof, a lot of us came off disappointed.  2015 has been rough for him. He's endured injuries and had some miserable starts and some great ones but he is currently on the Disabled List.  Bottom line, this guy's an entire career has been followed by hype from day one. Unless he wins 200 games and gets 5,000 K's, he'll go down as a bust in most people's eyes. I've enjoyed watching him pitch and hope he comes back and kills it for the Nats."

Nationals,3dsss2,mrsplacedsoul,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:47 2015 UTC,I think we still need a pitcher for this game.
Nationals,3dsss2,theOnlyGuyInTheRoom,5,Sun Jul 19 02:53:48 2015 UTC,Seems likely to be Joe Ross
Nationals,3dsss2,DemonFrog,3,Sun Jul 19 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"This listing goes along with pretty much all the outside listings I've looked at this year, stubhub and otherwise, in that they're more expensive than buying direct from the team with a coupon, even after paying the fees. This isn't a criticism, it's just such a reversal from my experience in previous years.  Tangentially related note for whoever can edit that: seems to be a problem with the big counter there... sum of just D3?? That's some bush-league formula-ing."
Nationals,3dsss2,zerocrates,2,Sun Jul 19 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine this is true of the upper decks, but I find when buying in the lower level that the resale market is better most of the time."
Nationals,3dsss2,ParCorn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"My brother and I are first time pkg holders..41 games..in sec 203,great seats.in shade.We have always done a lot of resale,market seems pretty soft for Nats tix,little over breaking even.We have had U MD hoops.Wizards Skins..this has been the softest market of any of them.Sounds like you think this season is an abberration?"
Nationals,3dsss2,DCsportsJohnny,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"What I mean to say is that the upper decks, mezzanine seats, etc. don't sell out so they don't have a strong resale value.  Section 203 looks like it's in the LF/RF mezzanine. I can go on the Nats website right now and use the GOV15 discount to get seats in the LF/RF mezzanine for $27, and it will come with a $6 loaded value which would bring the ""true value"" to $21. So if you want to sell your tickets for that section you will either (A) need to sell them for $21 or (B) wait until that section is sold out.  Season ticket holders in the baseline/dugout/homeplate seats don't have this problem because (A) those tickets don't have a coupon code and (B) those tickets usually sell out anyway, so they can charge face value or more on the resale market."
Nationals,3dsss2,ParCorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:33 2015 UTC,Which coupon codes are you using?
Nationals,3dsss2,zerocrates,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Mostly GOV15.  For this game, 400-level seats with the code are nominally $12. If you're buying 2, the price with all the fees is $34.50. There's a constant ""processing fee"" that makes the price worse if you buy singles, so it's $19.25 for just 1."

Nationals,3ds59i,Matugi1,3,Sat Jul 18 23:06:37 2015 UTC,2014 Fister pitched way above his peripherals.
Nationals,3ds59i,Dmac5797,8,Sat Jul 18 23:21:28 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. 2014 Fister was the type of player that could pitch above his peripherals. Kind of like how Clippard consistently pitches above his peripherals. Can you honestly say 2015 Fister is doing the same things that 2014 Fister did? This isn't the case of a regression. This is a player literally getting worse.
Nationals,3ds59i,whiteonbothsides,4,Sat Jul 18 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now he just can't locate"
Nationals,3ds59i,MaesterCat,7,Sat Jul 18 23:58:50 2015 UTC,The velocity has been the bigger issue IMO. 88-90 is a lot different than 85-88. But yeah command hasn't been great
Nationals,3ds59i,purplepenned,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's regression in the sense that it's regression to the mean; he's the same pitcher he was last year, maybe a little less velo, but he got away with a lot of luck last year (.262 BABIP as a ground ball pitcher is ridiculous).  This year his BABIP is more reflective of the kind of pitcher he is and it's why his ERA is close to his FIP and xFIP, unlike last year."
Nationals,3ds59i,purplepenned,5,Sun Jul 19 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"But he's not. He's a completely different pitcher. Less velocity, hanging pitches, and leaving sinkers up. Hence the higher BABIP. This isn't regression to the mean. This is him being a worse pitcher"
Nationals,3ds59i,Boymankid,2,Sun Jul 19 02:23:20 2015 UTC,"He might just be a 4 ERA guy. That pretty typical of a 5 spot, and many teams have someone like that for their ace.  While I wish Doug could be pitching better, it's better that he is the 5 spot. Luckily Scherzer and the rest are doing well."
