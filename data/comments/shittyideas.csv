shittyideas,3aoa8f,TheCigaretteFairy,2,Mon Jun 22 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"1) Donald Trump is nothing more than lucky to be born and irrationally self-confident; he's good at making it look like he knows what he's talking about even when he's done no research at all and/or is lying through his teeth and he hasn't earned a penny of his current net worth with his own hands or mind.  2) Money is an illusion. Capitalism may be the best economic system currently in practice today, but it's still broken and twisted into a tool for the world's wealthiest to cling to and expand their power. The fact that people have been indoctrinated into the religion of capitalism to the point that most can't see the possibility of a viable alternative is so fucked up it's laughable. What we need is alternative systems and people in office who care about public service and leadership, not their bank account.  3) All media is disgustingly two sided. There are other parties besides Democrat and Republican, and just because someone belongs to a certain political party doesn't make them right (glares at straight-balloters). And the difference between the big two is like the difference between Time Warner and Comcast: they aren't really in competition, except against you. George Fucking Washington warned us about this, but apparently that's the one thing about him I was the only one who paid attention in class for.  4) You can say whatever you please and have whatever opinions your little heart desires, but if you're objectively wrong you're gonna get shut down. Get over it."

The chicken is meant to be a suicidal person, a coward who would rather die than going through the burdens of life (that's why it's called a chicken, like ""Hah! are you a chicken? Bak bak bak bak!"").  Crossing the road is the suicide, more specifically getting run over.    So the joke:  Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side  Without any hidden meanings:  Why did the suicidal person go on the middle of the road?  To get run over and die.

Arcanine and Moltres are suitable replacements for Charizard, and Gyarados and Lapras can replace Blastoise.   Also, in the original games there was a move called razor leaf. It was supposed to have a 10% critical hit chance and a 90% regular hit chance, but the programmers fucked up and switched the percentages, making it one of the best moves in the game. Bulbasaur learns this move early.   Also, the leech seed/poison power/wrap combo will take down anyone (eventually).   I still pick Charmander just because he's cool, but Bulbasaur is a badass. Plus he's cute and Venusaur is one of the coolest pokemon names ever (a dinosaur named after a goddess!)."

ISIS would suck a concentration camps worth of Jewish dicks for those numbers.  There were some other issues with the overall strategy though."
