The English words ""usurp"" and ""usurpation"" (meaning ""to seize authority to which one has no right"") come from that first meaning.  The Latin word usurpo actually took on that meaning, too, but apparently not until a few centuries after the fall of the Republic.  The etymology is also fairly unusual.  Lewis and Short say that usurpo (and ergo usurpatio) might come from a contraction of usu- + rapio, although how that combination would produce a first conjugation verb is a total mystery to me.  Still, the meaning and proposed etymology fit together so neatly that the theory seems quite plausible."

I'm still waiting for the ""Pharr-izer"", a program that automagically formats any given Latin text 90-95% of the way to something like Pharr's Vergil text. Common words identified separately, context specific definitions below the nicely formatted and line numbered page, etc. It will be impossible to have a perfect system, but to automate most of the mechanical formatting and labeling and identifying work would make it incredibly easy to bring obscure texts or even snippets of text into the classroom for specialty topics discussions. And it could issue a new era of study for people who really liked Pharr's layout, but want to read something other than Vergil.  More advanced students shouldn't need this at all, but for first or second years/semesters, it could be wonderful for adding a little variety or commentary (as side-readings) to the study of the standard texts, and for students of other disciplines who only need to read pure Latin incidentally in their studies, the textual editions made in this way could provide a huge assist."

latin,3dum4h,bernex,7,Sun Jul 19 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"Tantum does more often stand behind the word it modifies but can also stand in front of it, e.g.    dein Tubero: 'nescio Africane cur ita memoriae proditum sit, Socratem omnem istam disputationem reiecisse, et tantum de vita et de moribus solitum esse quaerere. [...]'  Then Tubero [said]: 'Africanus, I don't know why it has been passed down like this: that Socrates had rejected this entire controversy and used to inquire only about [people's] way of living and customs.'   So (without context) the sentence is not entirely unambiguous as is. Moving tantum as you propose would, however, clearly make it modify 'mala et pira'.   If it was just one type of fruit, solus would imho be a better choice to communicate the ""only apples and pears"" sentiment: 'Iulius filiis sola pira dat'. Not sure about 'sola mala et pira', though, it sounds somewhat contradictory to me.  edit: I have to correct myself a little. ""sola pira"" would be good if there were different types of fruit but he gives the children only pears, i.e. ""only the pears"". For ""only pears"" when there are only pears available ""nihil nisi pira"" or ""nihil aliud quam pira"" would be fine."

latin,3dwnpx,WanderingOats,2,Mon Jul 20 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"What kind of reading experience do you want?  Tacitus or Horace, after three years of high school Latin, will probably go very slowly.  If you want to get in more volume, which is better for developing reading fluency, try something easier: Eutropius's history of Rome is very easy, and it was the first Latin text given to schoolboys for centuries (Brian Beyer has a recent edition of the first book or two).  Sallust is harder than Eutropius and would prepare you well for Tacitus.  Seneca's prose is rewarding, not terribly difficult, and should be accessible to you with a good commentary.  You could also try Cicero's Catilinarians -- again with a good commentary like Shapiro.  If you haven't read Familia Romana: Lingua Latina yet, I would highly recommend that you do so.  It's an excellent way to review and to read lots of good (though not ""authentic"") Latin prose.  You could also just go to the Dickinson College Commentaries and see what piques your interest.  There's an edition of the life of Hannibal by Cornelius Nepos, who's also a good easier prose author.  Edit: ""text,"" not ""textbook."""

latin,3dp8ky,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,3,Sat Jul 18 06:08:24 2015 UTC,"I had assumed dative, because inferno would, I thought, be an indirect object, with the thing being sent and the person sending it being the subject and agent, even though they are not directly stated in the sentence. I'm not sure, though, if it would be that or ad infernum, which is why I'd want a more experienced speaker to verify..."
latin,3dp8ky,vossbot,2,Sat Jul 18 10:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm only a student myself, and now that I've read your logic I can see where you're coming from with the dative.

latin,3dp8ky,B1tchImTatted,4,Sat Jul 18 06:18:26 2015 UTC,I would still say accusative because it's motion towards.
latin,3dp8ky,dustyflea,2,Sat Jul 18 08:44:13 2015 UTC,"""To"" with the dative really means something more like to whom something is done or given. It doesn't really reflect direction whither."
latin,3dp8ky,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,4,Sat Jul 18 12:06:42 2015 UTC,"You find the dative used for motion towards in poetry (e.g. it clamor caelo, Aen. 5.451) but in this case I'd pick ad + acc. I think you do need the ad here, because hell is more like a region than like a city/town/small island (ad Latium eo vs Romam eo).  That said, I really like /u/ReedsAndSerpents' suggestion below."

latin,3dkmc7,zoids111222,8,Fri Jul 17 01:02:54 2015 UTC,perhaps propriae sunt cogitationes meae would convey 'my own' better

It should be meae   Meae cogitationes sunt meae solae   That's grammatically good Latin, but the style is a little off and that impacts the meaning.  Based on how the predicate sits there with two adjectives but no noun, my brain kind of assumes a second noun there: ""my thoughts are my only"" [thoughts].    I suspect that all you're missing out on is just some vocabulary and recent practice.  As /u/IntelVoid points out ""my own"" is a great opportunity to use the wonderful adjective proprius -a -um (""particular, special, one's own, not anyone else's"")."

latin,3dkll3,IntelVoid,2,Fri Jul 17 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"de dicto and de re are a really nice pair. They literally mean ""concerning what is said"" and ""concerning the subject matter"".   How would you use the phrase ""of the term"" and ""of the meaning"" in a sentence? If the sentences go something like,     Sally wants an apple 'of the term', that is, anything she could call an apple Sally wants an apple 'of the meaning', that is, something which is actually an apple whether it is named that way or not    Then we could use some noun-phrase involving the words dictum and res. We get a choice of ablative of description or a genitive of description (the latter you would have come across in Ancient Greek syntax). Genitive of description is what you used in English when you said ""of the term"" and ""of the meaning"".    Sally wants an apple dicto. (ablative of description) Sally wants an apple dicti. (genitive of description) Sally wants an apple re. (ablative of description) Sally wants an apple rei. (genitive of description)    If using a single noun sounds clunky, prepositional noun phrases could be our way to go. I like the Late Latin use of the preposition secundum, ""following, according to"", which occurs a lot in the Vulgate.    Sally wants an apple secundum dictum. Sally wants an apple secundum rem."
latin,3dkll3,Foundinantiquity,2,Fri Jul 17 06:10:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is fantastic. To be a bit clearer, the term/meaning distinction is relevant when ascribing thoughts to individual subjects, Consider the following sentences:  1) John thinks that Beijing is beautiful.  2) Pierre thinks that Beijing is beautiful.  If we read 1 as ascribing to John a particular sentence in his head - the English sentence 'Beijing is beautiful' - then the sentence is true. But we can also read it as ascribing to John a particular conceptual content - as predicating the concept of beauty to his concept of the city of Beijing. (In this case, the sentence is still true).  For 2, imagine that Pierre has never spoken a word of English. So, we can't read (2) as ascribing a particular English sentence to Pierre's stream of thinking (at least, if we do, then (2) is false). However, if we read (2) as ascribing to Pierre the conceptual content that it also ascribed to John - using concepts to predicate beauty to Beijing.   The first reading of (2) is what I want to call ascription ""of the locution"" or ""of the term."" But the second is what I want to call ""of the meaning.""  Finally, if there's a way to make it work, it would be nice to get the de in there, as in the de dicto / de re distinction.   Thanks!"

latin,3djn7s,SirMustache007,5,Thu Jul 16 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"While ""humanism"" is hard to translate, my first instinct is humanismus.  As for ""without compromise"", if you want to use the word compromissum then you'll need the form compromisso in order to correctly use the preposition sine (""without"").  All in all, the closest I can manage is something like Humanismus sine compromisso.  Edit: When you change the ""Humanism"" Wikipedia page to Latin, the title is ""Humanismus"".  Obviously, it's Wikipedia, so trust it as much as you want. (https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanismus)"
latin,3djn7s,dj_brizzle,5,Thu Jul 16 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"The word ""humanismus"" is perfectly fine for modern Latinists, but it is not classical (it was created in 1808), and it is also kind of an aberration, because it uses a Latin root and a Greek suffix (humanus + -ismós). The classical humanitas which can mean both ""philanthropy"" or ""politeness"" and ""higher education"" or ""culture"", would be the classical choice.   As for compromissum (compromittere means literally ""to promise this if you promise that"") in classical Latin it was a legal term applied especially to the acceptance of an arbitration. The sense of ""limitation"" that word has in English can be translated in classical Latin as exceptio.   So, in pure classical Latin: Humanitas sine exceptione.   That said, ""Humanismus sine compromisso"" is morphologically and syntactically correct."

Feles was far and away the more common word.  It shows up in Plautus, Pliny, and Cicero.  Aelurus is a Greek borrowing and sounds distinctly... well, Greek.  Like always calling your cat ""my gato"" would in the southwestern U.S.: everyone knows what you mean, but you'd still sound a little silly if you weren't from the right ethnic group.  In Latin, there was probably an additional flavor to it of sounding educated and fancy.  Side Note! English cognates have more to do with how Latin was used in the middle ages and renaissance than how it was used in Classical times.  It's usually best to avoid that line of reasoning: too many false friends, too much stilted Latin.  Advice: Stick with felis.  On rare occasion, you can use aelurus to sound fancy.  And for a rare and post-classical word for ""tomcat,"" you could maybe throw in a catus every once in a while."

Guidradus qui dicor ABISSUS , de loco plurio et Marchisia jugale ejus. There’s a transcription error here. One would expect “dicor” to be “dictus,” standard in name formulas of this era.

Paolo son of the Antonio Abissi called de Claria/Clara et Ursula   “Andreas Bongianni et Margarita, uxor Joannis de Claria”   Andreas Bongianno and Margarita, wife of Johannes de Clara/Claria   Marta “filia Antonii de’ Abis et dicti de Claria”.

latin,3dbpi1,Whoosier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"Like jared2013, I’m puzzled by the “imo” in the grave inscription. Keep in mind that there are usually lots of abbreviations in such inscriptions; they’re like our “R.I.P,” which we understand but folks 300 years from now might not. So I’m wondering if “imo” is that. (There’s a vague chance it’s a variant of “immo” or “rather,” so that it’s “Come, Lord Jesus, rather I come. . .” but I don’t like that solution.) The “D. Johanni Abisio” = Domini JA or “Lord JA,” another case of an abbrev. word. The “D. Emerita” is his mother’s name, “Domina Emerita” or “Lady Emerita.” The “curiensis” is Raetia or Churraetia near Switzerland. I’d be happier if that “functo” would be “defuncto” which is the usual choice for funeral monuments. Thus, “in domino vita functo” would be something like “having departed this life in the Lord” on May 3rd, A.D. 1664 at the age of 75. The “NO MOR” must be another standard funeral abbreviation but it eludes me. “NO” can sometimes be “nobilissima.” It could be something descriptive of Emerita: “nobilissima MORibus?”—most nobly mannered, but I’m just guessing."

Your analysis of the Latin is spot on, but your description of English does not match the way any person grows up speaking our language.

No one says ""it is I"" or ""it was he"" unless someone teaches them to do so because ""it's proper grammar.""  Which is wasn't until someone in the 1800s decided that English needed to be more like Latin.  (Shakespeare used ""me"" as the object of ""to be"", and if it's good enough for Billy Shakes, it's good enough for *I.)    We do have a rule in idiomatic spoken English: the word is ""me"" if it comes after the verb or is the object of a preposition.  Done.  And so much easier.  The same rule applies in French, where no one seems to have a problem with it.  After all, no one claims Louis XIV was speaking bad French when he said ""L'etat c'est moi"" instead of *""L'etat, c'est je.""  Case is basically a moribund feature in modern English, with just a few idiomatic reflexes we still keep around.

Qualifiers were only added to the names when more than one female daughter existed. For two daughters the obvious selections were ""maior"" and ""minor"". If the family grew beyond that size, ordinal numerals were employed - Prima, Altera (less commonly: Secunda), Tertia, etc.   If one daughter is referred to as ""the Younger"" is it fair to assume a sibling would be the ""Elder"" in that case?

Sounds like they didn't have much of a Navy, let alone something similar to Marines, and what they did have was looked down upon. This is straight off Wikipedia, but:   The Roman navy (Latin: Classis, lit. ""fleet"") comprised the naval forces of the Ancient Roman state. The navy was instrumental in the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean basin, though it never enjoyed the prestige of the Roman legions. Throughout their history, the Romans remained a primarily land-based people, and relied partially on their more nautically inclined subjects, such as the Greeks and the Egyptians, to build and man their ships. Partly because of this, the navy was never wholly embraced by the Roman state, and deemed somewhat ""un-Roman"".[1] In Antiquity, navies and trading fleets did not have the logistical autonomy that modern ships and fleets possess. Unlike modern naval forces, the Roman navy even at its height never existed as an autonomous service, but operated as an adjunct to the Roman army."

Each fleet was a classis and was very much a permanent fixture: the first fleets mentioned above remained for up to 300-400 years at the relevant cities.   Lewis & Short also lists classici, classicorum as a word meaning 'marines'. Tacitus has the following passage:  postquam universa classicorum legio sacramentum eius accepit, fidens viribus, et quos adhuc singulos extimulaverat, accendendos in commune ratus pro vallo castrorum ita coepit  'It was when the whole legion from the fleet had taken the oath to him, that feeling confidence in his strength, and thinking that the men, on whose individual feeling he had been working, should be roused by a general appeal, he stood before the rampart of the camp, and spoke as follows...'

latin,3d09oe,nexus88,6,Sun Jul 12 12:03:56 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb is that every clause has one subject and one subject only. In this case, you start a new clause after the verb timebat introduced by a copula (in your case ne), so there is a new subject, namely sua mater, and it is nominative. When you use an accusative and infinitive construction, as far as Latin is concerned, you're still in the same clause, and that's why you don't get a new nominative there. The 'her' is object in the embedded clause, so it's still accusative.  A few other points: after a verb of fearing, ne introduces what is feared, but if this fear is a negation, ne is in fact replaced by ut. You can see that the two copulae are indeed exactly the opposite of what you would expect: ne with an affirmative fear clause, and ut with a negative.  Another thing: forms of suus can only refer to the subject of a sentence. You can indeed also use this word when referring to the main clause subject in an embedded clause, as you do here, but for consistency, I'd say you would then also have to use se instead of eam.  I hope I've been clear. These things always get somewhat complicated. Ask away if something's unclear!"

I use illegible frequently as he notes several words from other languages that I am unable to copy.   The etymology of facetus is not absolutely certain. It may have originally meant 'bright,' from an IE root illegible appearing in fax 'torch' (illegible), Lithuanian illegible 'light, candle' and the Hesychian glosses illegible (illegible) illegible show through and illegible (illegible) illegible, illegible 'light.' This facetus may have been built to faces, an archaic biform of fax (Paul. Fest. 77 Lindsay). However, the phonetic similarly of facetus to facere 'do,' factus 'done' may have influenced semantics and cause it to acquire a sense like 'polished' or 'finished' a sense that certainly seems to fit the earliest attestations somewhat better. Indeed a genuine etymological connection to facere is not out of the question.  ...   I would also make a complete guess myself.

The reasons to use forms like ne id facias or ne id fac are a desire to sound archaic (e.g. Cicero has Cato Maior say ne requiras in De senectute) or to fit to the meter. The form ne id facias is also attractive because it allows you to have sentences that are syntactically final clauses but which can also stand on their own as a prohibitive.  [edit: as an example for that last point, consider this epigram by Martial:  Cur non mitto meos tibi, Pontiliane, libellos? ne mihi tu mittas, Pontiliane, tuos.  You ask why I don't send you my booklets, Pontilianus? so that you, Pontilianus, don't send me yours.  That you can also read the last line as a prohibitive ""For the love of God, don't send me yours!!!"" adds imho significantly to the quality of this epigram.]  edit: consulted LHS:  One type I missed above is  ne id faxis! which naturally only applies to verbs that can form this kind of sigmatic subjunctive and is only found in the comedians.  LHS claims that originally the type ne id feceris! was used for singular cases (""don't do this right now!""), whereas ne id facias! was used for general prohibitions (""never do this!""). It also quotes the claim that with Plautus ne id facias! has a general motivational character, ne id feceris! has a preventive character and ne id faxis! & ne id fac! have an inhibiting-corrective character. ... which is all nice and well but doesn't really apply to the way classical authors (or even Augustan poets) write.  LHS also says that during classical times noli id facere becomes prevalent (in comparison to ne id feceris) and is considered more urbane - that is actually of interest to us as we might have a tendency to regard ne feceris as the stylistically better form, simply because it is the more difficult one."

I don't believe that ""I hope to be faithful"" (supplying a  ""sim"") is a reasonable translation - the sentence is perfectly sensible as is.   edit: the use of ""ut"" to express a real property rather than a comparison is not uncommon. E.g. Cicero ""tum Pythius, qui esset ut argentarius apud omnes ordines gratiosus, piscatores ad se convocavit"" (""who as a banker was welcome with all orders of society"", not ""like a banker""). If you wanted to say ""I plead with you as a friend"", you'd (imho) rather say ""ut amicus te obsecro"" than just ""amicus te obsecro"".  edit2: you can (as Kühner-Stegmann does) see a causal connotation in this use of ""ut"": ""he was welcome, because he was a banker"", ""I plead with you, because I am your friend"", ""I hope, because I am a Christian"", ...

You can just start reading (with handy vocab glosses) and check out the related grammar sections as you go.

For learning on your own, I second Wheelock's, partly because it has the answers to the exercises in the back of the book.  People around here also like Ørberg's Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, which is 100% in Latin (even the page with the publication information!) and is geared towards reading fluency.

latin,3cefhc,skltllghtnng,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:42:36 2015 UTC,What abt latrocinium
latin,3cefhc,correon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"A great idea, but without proper context, the word latrocinium doesn't refer to a ""brotherhood of thieves"" so much as ""thievery.""  Latrocinium is the act or state of being a latro, a word that originally meant ""soldier for hire"" but came to refer to ""person who fights for money"" more generally, especially brigands or highwaymen, a style of thievery that is thankfully all but extinct in modern developed world.  If the latro operated on the coast or the sea, the word should be translated as ""pirate,"" along the words pirata or praedo.  (The word latro could also mean ""person of generic bad character,"" like ""rogue"" or ""scoundrel"" in English.)  Latrocinium -i (n.) can therefore be translated as ""mercenary service"" or ""highway robbery"" or ""piracy"" or ""bad character.""  But Cicero did famously use it once to refer to a band of robbers, near the end of what is possibly his most famous speech: ""nunc si ex tanto latrocinio iste unus tolletur, videbimur fortasse ad breve quoddam tempus cura et metu esse relevati, periculum autem residebit et erit inclusum penitus in venis atque in visceribus rei publicae.""

What I've always wondered with loan words like these, is how the Romans would have pronounced them. As I understand it, the gamma, or g, in the Greek would have been pronounced as we pronounce the combination 'ng'. But would the Romans have done the same? They had their own way of writing that sound, namely 'ng', but they didn't use it for the Greek words. Did they pronounce a g before the m? Or did they recognise it as a loan word and adapt their pronunciation accordingly?"
latin,3capgl,Sochamelet,2,Tue Jul 7 12:20:06 2015 UTC,"They had their own way of writing that sound, namely 'ng',   The Greeks spelled the velar nasal sound with a gamma, but that sound only occurred before another velar stop: kappa, gamma, or chi.  Bust out your copy of Vox Latina again.  The Romans also wrote the velar nasal with just a <g>, though only when it preceded the letter /n/, as in magnus or agnus or cognosco.  And although that sound could also be written with an <n> (as in ingens), it only showed up in that situation when followed by a <g> or <c>.  Native Latin words with /gm/ are few, but they fit neither of those situations, and the etymological evidence suggests that the <g> probably was meant to be the normal voiced velar stop."

latin,3cb2qu,Glofkill,9,Mon Jul 6 15:27:29 2015 UTC,"From what I can find, it seems that this comes from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, where he says    The policy of the emperors and the senate, as far as it concerned religion, was happily seconded by the reflections of the enlightened, and by the habits of the superstitious, part of their subjects. The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.   It seems like the attribution of this to Seneca Minor is rather disputed, as it's unseen in his work. If you're looking for quotes from the Classical authors in support of humanism or against religion, Lucretius' De Rerum Natura has a lot of quotes.

latin,3cb1uy,bobisbit,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure why, but the translations are literally gibberish.    Well, it's not a mystery why it's so terrible.  It's because language is always ambiguous, unless you're speaking lojban, a constructed language designed for zero semanic ambiguity--but you have to translate TO or FROM an ambiguous language, so not even that.  No one should ever expect an automated process to be accurate for human language translation.  This includes the languages that GT treats the best--spanish, french, etc.  If someone is really, really new to latin, and needs some help translating a simple phrase, the best resources are (IMO), whitaker's words and wiktionary.  Whitaker's words will let you search english for possible latin words:  http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?english=canopy  And wiktionary you can use to find all the inflectional forms:  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conopeum#Latin  Both are pretty reliable.

Still, he's so precise that I don't think you'd be missing much by reading him in translation.   Leibniz   Haven't read him either.   Seneca   Seneca had a fantastic written style, and his drama is a highlight of Latin literature.  I've not read too much of his philosophy, as the Stoics tend to drive me up a wall.  If he's on your reading list, it's worth picking up the original.   Marcus Aurelius   ... wrote in Greek.  excellent Latin writers you should also consider   Cicero   He's not a particularly original thinker, but de re publica and de legibus contain some pretty good political philosophy.  I'll admit that de finibus bonorum et malorum is beautifully written ethical philosophy even if not of my favorite doctrines.   Lucretius   de rerum natura is a six-book epic poem that uses high poetic style and some purposefully archaic language to give one of the most complete and beautiful synopses of Epicurean thought.

latin,3c26sv,Latinenthusiast,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"The book itself is a halfway point between Lingua Latina and Wheelock in terms of philosophical layout and pedagogical approach. I've never taught with it, but I reviewed it pretty thoroughly on the advice of a trusted colleague and I've used parts of it in teaching subsequently. The book has a lot to recommend itself, and to be honest I think it's likely the best all around book for a teacher committed to grammar/translation in some way as an approach and/or someone who wants to move toward active Latin but doesn't have a huge amount of experience with it. The student textbook is on some levels relatively limited in active Latin support and what it does offer is ALM-based, so a bit behind the times in research. I've heard that the teacher's edition has a LOT more in it to support active work, but I haven't had the chance to look because the proof copies are always of the student text and I wasn't willing to invest that much money to find out. Depending on what you're looking to do with Latin, I'd highly recommend LNM as at least a tool to keep in your arsenal. It's my second favorite text behind Lingua Latina, and really only isn't tied with it because I find more in it that I disagree with from a pedagogical standpoint. It also has some major advantages over LLPSI in some really key areas for classroom work, like the expanded culture sections and the fact that it covers the entire history of Latin literature."

latin,3c26sv,translostation,2,Sun Jul 5 06:43:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Do you think you can elaborate on why you disagree with some of the aspects of it from a pedagogical standpoint?   Sure. It still relies heavily on a grammar/translation presentation of new material, which just doesn't align well with the consensus currently established in the SLA research community regarding how students' brains pick up the language. In particular, as far as we can tell explicit grammar instruction doesn't have much impact at all on a student's language acquisition. I can lecture and drill you on a grammatical topic all that I want, but in the long term it just shows very little return in terms of your internalizing whatever it is and being able to adequately interpret it or produce it in an authentic context. The strategies we teach for translation are, to quote one of the most reputable experts in the field, Bill VanPatten, just ""teaching students to cope with language that is above their level"". The approach to vocabulary in LNM is in some ways similar - the reading passages are short and LOADED with a lot of new vocabulary. Studies show that in terms of developing acquisition students need (1) a lot of comprehensible repetition of a small number of new words at a time, and (2) large texts that are comprehensible and compelling to the students - usually with at least 95% of the vocabulary and structures in the text already known to the student. On a pedagogical level, LNM just doesn't reflect these realities. To be fair, neither does LLPSI. It fails both of those tests as well, but it's a lot closer to what we know works, so I'm more comfortable with it as a text for instruction.    I know you have been to Vivarium Novum, is there a lot of help for practice with oral Latin? Also what do you think Tunberg and Minkova's idea was with creating it?   At AVN? That's all you do. In terms of LNM, I didn't see a lot right in the text, but as I said I only looked at the student edition. Terence and Milena have both told me that the really great stuff is in the teacher's text, and a friend who teaches with it in their program at Kentucky agrees. I haven't seen it yet to comment. I think it's designed with the idea that a lot of that work would be teacher-led/generated in the classrooms using the text.   I'm not a mind-reader in terms of being able to interpret what Terence and Milena were thinking in writing it. I know that exposing students and teachers to the entire Latin tradition was a big priority and the text accomplishes that excellently. The first two books are essentially a survey course in Latin literature via modified texts. The third book is an excellent Pre-AP text with tons of AP alignment and practice. It's also got the best cultural support of any textbook series that I've encountered on the market. In terms of their balance on a pedagogy level, this book seems to me to be a very considerate balance between the prevalent pedagogical models in vogue in teaching Latin. It does a really excellent job of being flexible - it's got enough grammar/translation for a traditional program, it's got long enough texts to compete with a reading program, and I can absolutely see being able to use and teach with it very effectively in an entirely spoken approach. I actually tried to convince some colleagues previously of a curriculum that combined LNM and LLPSI. I think it would have been an excellent pairing that really made room for all of our different perspectives. I'd be perfectly happy teaching in a program that uses LNM as opposed to LLPSI. I prefer the later, but don't mistake that as a statement against LNM. It's truly an excellent textbook and should (if we have any sense at all as a field) replace Wheelock as the standard. It's simply too dynamic not to be the next standard text.    Would you say it is still useful for someone who is independently studying outside a classroom?   Totally. I think to some extent that depends a lot on the students' interests, desires, and commitments, but it's definitely a text that would be really accessible for someone self studying, and in fact would give a much better perspective of the field as a whole than Wheelock or LLPSI, especially if you're willing to invest in the ancillary texts for added history/culture and more practice exercises. I don't think LLPSI is in any way better for people who want to self study spoken Latin, and in fact might not be as good on some levels because it isn't consciously designed as a text to foster spoken fluency. At least LNM has explicit modeled conversational components for you to learn from. My bigger concern for self study would just be cost. Wheelock is usually $20-$30. LLPSI is $15-$25. LNM is >$60 depending on whether you get the student or teacher edition, and I believe all of them are closer to $100. That's a $200-$300 investment all in compared to ~$100 for either of the other options."

What do you think about his methods?   I've heard of Evan's strategies and have poked around with a lot of what he's produced, but I confess that I haven't spent much time at it. He bases a lot of his work off of Comenius' Opera Didactica Omnia which I've worked with in the past and really liked (though I confess that I haven't read it all and it comes with its own peculiarities and challenges). I've spoken with people who have used Evan's materials more directly than I and they all seemed to find them quite helpful. They also have the advantage of engaging you with content that moves beyond the page and incorporates oral/aural components as well - something that you just won't get with any textbook as it's currently published. (I know Ørberg has a recording, but it's not the same.) Justin Slocum-Bailey has initiated the Latin Listening Project with a number of people pitching in, so more resources along those lines are on the way, but Evan is definitely one of the leaders in producing them right now.   In terms of LNM, Its awesome that you actually get to talk to Terence and Milena. I hope to have the same experience once I can read unadapted texts(I think thats the requirement for Conventiculum Latinum), it just seems like they are more concerned with getting people from passive knowledge to active understanding without consideration of the implication of these methods on the novice. Is that a fair assessment?   You should definitely go to the Conventiculum when you're ready. I've enjoyed my experiences at them and will be going again this year. In fact, I've signed up for two years and an MA with Terence and Milena at Kentucky. should be fun times.   [Disclaimer: anything I say about this is my speculation. Terence, Milena, and I have had a number of shorter conversations about pedagogy, but none of them at the sort of depth/detail that I think would allow me to confidently speak about their concerns and positions with too much certainty. The following, then, cum grano salis.]  In terms of their concerns, it seems to be rooted in a belief that I share with them - that speaking Latin is fun and all, but the point of engaging with it in this manner academically isn't to speak it, it's to read it. The reason an active command is necessary isn't to fulfill some sort of communication gap between people (that's at best an incidental development), but to help students access Latin texts much more quickly and directly with much less headache in terms of fluent reading. At the end of the day, the literature is the target and active Latin is the best tool to get us access to that target as quickly and efficiently as possible.   The key there is ""as quickly and efficiently as possible"". That means that, from their perspective, if teaching grammar and vocabulary explicitly can help that process, we need to do that too. If it means translations from Latin to English, we should do that as well. The end game is reading texts as soon as we can, because that's where the good stuff is. This shouldn't be misconstrued to suggest that they think we should ignore what research tells us about how a brain processes and learns a language. They completely agree that we need to take that information into account, but what we do with it in terms of instruction needs to be decided based on the goal in mind (above).  I completely agree with them about this, both in terms of the goal and the role that SLA research should play in informing how we get there. I DO think explicit grammar instruction has a role in our classrooms and it's something we need to offer students as another tool for thinking about the language and how it functions, especially the analytical sort of student that tends to gravitate to Latin in the first place. The important questions in my mind are 1) when do we introduce explicit instruction, 2) at what level of detail do we offer it, 3) how much time do we devote to the process, and 4) how do we want to relate our activities and assessments to it. Given the research, I'm not sure that explicit instruction should occur before significant exposure to the concept in context, that it should be nearly as jargon-laden or complex as we make it, that it should take up nearly as much of our time as we allow it to, or that it should play as central a role in our activities and assessments as it currently does. I just happen to think LLPSI better aligns with how I want to teach given my positions on those questions. I wouldn't say that Terence and Milena don't think about novice students - they think about them quite a bit actually. I think it's got a lot to do with the level of student they teach (university instruction is not the same as high school or middle school) and the context in which they teach as well as their personal answers to those questions. There's really very little at all that separates my position from theirs on the issue.  In terms of LNM and the Conventicula, I think they also have to be viewed as strategy pieces in the broader game of pushing for a move to Latin Studies and an expanded idea of both the literary tradition of Latin and the ways we go about teaching it. The population of people familiar with and comfortable in a Grammar/Translation approach is orders of magnitude larger than those of us who speak Latin, and even in that group the number of people who can function at an advanced level is extremely small - perhaps a couple of thousand globally. Trying to get the message out and make changes first means putting it out there in a medium and manner that the likely recipients can understand and work with. LNM does that brilliantly. It is the ideal text to start exposing instructors to these alternative perspectives in an environment that feels comfortable and familiar to them, while encouraging them to consider alternative (and better) avenues for their teaching. The Conventicula are great because once a teacher decides they want to move in that direction, they provide focused and targeted professional development to help them build a basic skill set to get going, and then offer strategic opportunities to continue to enhance and develop those skills. In short, the formats of both things seem to me ideal for spreading the ideas that Terence and Milena want to share as far and wide as possible. It's really great strategy.    What would you recommend for someone who is interested in self-study for the purpose of being able to speak fluently in Latin? They want to be able to read but that is more a secondary goal.   Well, my first question would be speaking to what end if not reading? Your communicative options aside from engaging with texts are quite limited. I'd still recommend LLPSI as the text to start with, but instead of trying to immediately develop speaking fluency I'd suggest you aim for the ability to write freely whatever you'd like in good Latin. It develops the same sort of mental process you need for speaking, but doesn't require someone to speak to. You can even write dialogues (a great exercise for learners at all levels) and plays if you want to give it more of a spoken flavor. Once you've worked through the LLPSI series (both books and all the exercises), my suggestion would be to study the Renaissance colloquia - Erasmus, Pontanus, etc. They're a great resource for getting a sense of spoken style. You could also look at any number of Latin plays, all of which mimic oral Latin to one extent or another. From there, it's really all about finding someone to practice speaking with, but if you do a lot of writing output, you'll find that speaking doesn't present too much of a challenge either beyond just producing the sounds correctly."

A teacher gave them a test in which they were to write out the declensions of some words, and there was a maximum of about 30 or so forms that would actually be written down, but each wrong form would only get 1 point marked off from 100. So the lowest possible mark was 70%, a pass, even if you wrote every single thing wrong.

They use a method called ""chunking"" where one point is assigned per ""logical sense unit"" - e.g. a prepositional phrase is counted in its entirety as a single point, as are noun/adjective pairs. The AP grades by deducting the entire point for any registered error. I've experimented with giving half credit for partially correct answers using their model in the past, but found that in general it really wasn't worth the extra time and effort to differentiate on my end so instead I decided to keep the operation binary and scale student scores after the fact instead of doing a raw percentage calculation. That also had the advantage of directly mimicking the AP model, and since the end of my program was an AP course it made a lot of sense to me to prepare students for that grading reality from the beginning.   To be entirely honest, I think grading translations is a waste of time both on the teacher's end and for the students. I won't burden anyone here with the logic behind that statement unless you're really interested in knowing why, but after explaining the scoring model I've used in the past (and which I think is best) for this activity, I also thought it worth pointing out that I don't use it any longer and in fact disagree with the whole premise in the first place."

Since those in the rear are usually anonymous and not likely to get any glory (as opposed to the duces), agmen cogere is used here figuratively to mean ""to give anonymous and discrete support"".  Basically, in this sentence, Cicero is being faithful to one of his most known and criticized personality traits: ambivalence. If you are not giving support in either a discrete manner (agmen cogere) or assuming leadership (nec duces simus) you are not really giving any actual support.

For 'mechanism', there are things like machinamentum and machinatio, but this depends on context again. For instance, do you mean the abstract concept of a mechanism, or the mechanical intricacies of a machine?  And finally, 'telos' is in fact a Greek word, but I have no idea in what kind of context you want to use it.

latin,3bspum,vossbot,6,Wed Jul 1 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"""An historic occasion"" is not at all rare to hear on the BBC.  The strange combination of ""an"" with a word beginning with /h/ is a leftover from the times when it was considered acceptable to drop aitches in standard English.  This is now relegated to dialects such as Cockney.  Literary instances of ""an historic..."" (which in fact represented ""an 'istoric..."") led to people actually saying it with both /n/ and /h/.  Very few people actually speak with this quirk these days.  Latin did eventually start dropping /h/, but it is seems that even when it was pronounced, it was considered to be a modification of surrounding sounds (i.e. an added aspiration) rather than a separate consonant.  This is even clearer in Greek, where words beginning with the sound are simply spelt with a vowel marked as being aspirated, and when it appears after a consonant, that consonant is simply changed into an aspirated version (e.g. κ to χ) rather than the /h/ being written separately.  Remember also that ex can be used before consonants.  It only optionally shortens to e.  So ex homine is definitely fine."

latin,3bsmv2,deltashield22,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"The two most important factors in knowing what words go together are a good understanding of word endings and an understanding of the context. When I look at a Latin sentence I instinctually pick out the cases and gender of the nouns. If you have a solid understanding of what the endings for each case are then you will begin to naturally see which words agree in case, number, and gender. Knowing the declensions is a large part of this.  Occasionally you will come across words that have multiple possibilities for case, number, and gender.   In these situations you need to understand the context of the sentence to make a good guess about which words go together. If the subject of the sentence is neuter and plural you could safely assume that an adjective like ""laeta"" probably goes with that noun. Laeta could be feminine, nominative, singular or it could be neuter, nominative, plural, but in this case you must use context clues to decide what word laeta goes with. If you know that the subject should be ""happy"" according to the context of the text, then that is probably your answer! Even with this strategy you will still make mistakes, but you get better with practice. Good luck!"

It could in that sense be used to refer to big changes in place, like the movements of the stars or whatever.  It also came to be used to refer to any kind of change: motion words being used to refer to abstract change is a pretty common metaphor.  (English: ""The log turned to ashes.""  ""The operation went to pot."")  But it could also be used (by metonymy) to refer to the smallest speck of something that could produce a movement or change of the scale when someone was weighing a thing.  A ""moment"" of gold was be the smallest speck of that material that would tip the yard of a jeweler's scale.  This is where the senses of precision and smallness came from.  Separately from the sense of ""tiniest bit,"" the meaning of ""movement"" (as a quality of an object) came to [note: motion as metaphor for change] refer to both the object's literal weight (think: motion downward) and from there to refer to its figurative weight (think: importance) more generally."

latin,3bovwx,Haydaddict,10,Tue Jun 30 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"I dislike this question because the argument turns on two meaningless semantic distinctions.  First, you choose to define what makes a language ""dead.""  Obviously it means ""no one speaks it,"" but who counts as speaking a language: People who learned that language as their first language?  People who got it before the end of their critical period for language acquisition?  People who can read and converse in it even if not as well as their first language?  People who are in power and recognize it as an official ""language""?  Second, it also turns more subtly on how you define ""Latin.""  No person fell asleep speaking Latin and woke up the next morning speaking Spanish or Italian or Romanian or Rumansch or Waloon or French or Portuguese or Catalan or Sardinian or Corsican or any of the other Romance languages.  Those languages are what Latin gradually turned into in different places, changing as languages do.  If you take a broad definition, then Latin is still living in the mouths of three-quarters of a billion people.  Finally, why bother caring about Latin if you're worried about what's dead?  Latin exists and is still taught in schools and is recorded in books and plays and music and spoken at Rome by officials in the Roman Catholic Church.  There's no danger of Latin disappearing.  There is a huge danger of losing any of the thousands of endangered native languages that are still barely spoken today in North America and Papua New Guinea and Australia and Africa and Russia and Southeast Asia... and even a few in Europe.  (Side note: I once interviewed a man who was one of three living speakers of his language, which is only now being written down for the first time.)  If you care about language death, go get a degree in linguistics and do something about it before it's too late."

latin,3bovwx,correon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Obviously it means ""no one speaks it,""   That's not obvious at all!  People speak all kinds of dead languages (Latin, Attic, Biblical Hebrew, ...), some people learned dead languages in early childhood (Montaigne being the most famous example but even now there are families raising their children bilingually with Latin as one of the languages) and teaching a child Latin as its (sole) first language is only hindered by practical & ethical considerations (lack of playmates, lack of age-appropriate books, ...).   I think the much more plausible definition of a language being dead or alive is linked to the rate of innovation both within the language itself and in the literature it brings forth. The literary variant of Latin was quite alive in pre-classical times and during the Late Republic, died (at least in pagan use) in the 2nd century CE, underwent a brief revitalization as classicism broke down and vulgar elements entered the written language during the early middle ages, and was restored to its previous lifeless status by the Carolingian reforms and the Renaissance.  In my opinion it would be absurd to claim that the state of literary Latin e.g. in the 4th century was very different from the one it is in today - the language is essentially frozen and its literary production highly imitative.   Just speaking Latin does very little to breath life into the language, if we are looking for living Latin we have to watch people like Mauro Pisini who move away from mere imitation of ancient exemplars and through their work actively develop the language (well, at least they would, if their works ever made it into the hands of future students)."
latin,3bovwx,bitterlatinist,2,Wed Jul 1 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"Latin is not technically considered a dead language, because it didn't die so much as it evolved into Spanish, French, etc.  Similarly, Proto-Germanic didn't die, it evolved into German and English, etc.  Old English didn't die, it evolved into Modern English.  The term ""dead language"" technically refers to a language that no one passed on at all.  Like if an indigenous population is all mostly killed, and the few survivors just start speaking the language of their conquerers, without teachning their kids the new language.  With latin, everyone kept speaking latin.  They taught their kids the language they always knew, but when no one was watching, that language turned into Portuguese."

latin,3bkkoe,NLBuescher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:09:34 2015 UTC,Interesting. In Spanish it is similar but there are different exceptions then Latin. So when does the gender reflect the person versus the noun? Is it only when the subject refers to a person?
latin,3bkkoe,Correctrix,7,Tue Jun 30 01:13:20 2015 UTC,"In your example, the subject of the sentence is ""you"", so the gender varies depending on who you are talking to, but in other cases the gender of ""paratus"" always agrees with the subject."

latin,3bkh7w,Correctrix,3,Tue Jun 30 06:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'll explain it a bit.  I believe that quantum is better than quod because I think that one speaks of ""how great"" a price something has in Latin, rather than simply ""what"" price.  So, that leaves us with quantum pretium habet vita? for ""what (i.e. how great a) price has life?"" or quantum pretium est vitae? for ""what (i.e. how great a) price is there for life?"" using the dative of possession, which is a common way of expressing ""have"" in Latin.  As mentioned by others, est is commonly omitted.  We can also use a verb that conveys price.  Valet is ""costs"" or ""is worth""; it's the origin of our word ""value"".  ""Constat"" is ""costs"" or ""stands at""; it's the origin of our word ""cost"".  I've used this along with quantum in a form called the genitive of value, conveying ""how much"" i.e. ""at how great a price"".  The genitive of value works with pronouns.  With nouns, one generally uses the ablative of value, hence quanto pretio constat vita? for literally ""at how great a price does a life stand?"".  There's no indefinite article in Latin, so vita is both ""life"" in general and ""a life"".  If it's important to distinguish between the two of these, we can throw in the word ""one"", e.g. Quanti valet una vita?, but that makes it wordier."

latin,3bkh7w,NLBuescher,5,Tue Jun 30 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"You could probably get away with dative of possession, vitae, and swap the implied habet for an implied est, which is possibly a more natural verb to drop."

To address some of /u/teh_blackest_of_men's points, this is because in Latin one usually exclaims something in the accusative. ""Libros"" and ""breve tempus"" are both accusative here because the sentence is an exclamation.  Secondly the uses of ""quot"" and ""quam"" are more accurate than something like ""tot"" and ""tam"" (their non-interrogative counterparts) since this is an exclamation. Exclamations are special cases, so ""quot"" functions like ""tot"" and ""quam"" functions like ""tam"".  I'm not perfect, so let me know if I got something wrong!"

Maybe I'll get to the rest in ~10 hours from now (if nobody else has done it by then):  ...  As I recently gathered from the letter you sent me that you desire to see the method I invented by which many curved lines (as D. Huddenius told you) can be converted into straight lines, I believe that I mustn't refrain from sending this method to you on the spot, especially so that you can pass judgement on it. But I want to really warn you that I came up with this method as I was preparing my journey to France, as a result of which I wasn't able to investigate everything which could be said about this matter, nor could I bring everything to paper I had discovered before my departure. In France, however, I resolved to never leave any time for Mathematics and instead to address myself fully to other matters, so much that I now don't believe myself to be able to write anything worthy of being printed. But, to satisfy your request in whichever way I can (considering the time that has passed) as it is a great honor to me: I decided to recall and to write down in few words what I then thought about this matter and to treat it in brief here. Which, if you don't judge it to be displeasing to other mathematicians, you can include in your Commentaries.  Farewell and continue to love him  who is completely yours  Henricus van Heuraet  (Our friend Huddenius also greets you thoroughly/lovingly.)

latin,3bhgvh,bitterlatinist,4,Mon Jun 29 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"[Proposition:]  If two curved lines are given, for example, A B C D E and G H I K L, and a straight line A F, of such a kind that (while the perpendicular line M I, drawn out of the point M, which has been chosen on the line A F at will, intersects the given curves in C & I, so that C Q is also perpendicular to the curve A B C D E), M C and C Q are to each other, as some given line Σ is to M I: then the surface A G H I K L F will be equal to the rectangle included under the given line Σ and the other straight line that is equal to the curve A B C D E.  [Proof:]  The line A F be divided into a number of parts, for example, in the points O, M & P, and perpendicular lines O H, M I, P K be drawn which intersect the curve A B C D E in the points B, C & D, but the curve G H I K L in the points H, I & K; and through the points A, B, C, D & E tangents be lead, which cross each other in the points R, S, T & V; and through those points the lines R a, Y b, Z c, e d shall be drawn as perpendiculars to A F; and through the points G, H, I, K and L lines shall be drawn parallel to A F, which intersect R a in f and a, Y b in g & b, Z c in h & c, e d in I & d; then from S the line S X be drawn as a parallel to the line A F, and the tangent T S is to be extended up to the point N.  Because of the right angle N C Q, C M will be to C Q as M N is to N C. M N, however, is to N C, as S X is to S T. Therefore S Y is to S T, as C M is to C Q. And because C M is to C Q, as Σ is to M I, S X will also be to S T, as Σ is to M I, and therefore the rectangle under S X or Y Z and M I or Y b will be equal to the rectangle under S T and Σ. In the same way it will be shown that the rectangle c e is equal to the rectangle under T V and Σ, and that the rectangle d F is equal to the rectangle V E, Σ, and the rectangle a Y is equal to the rectangle under R S and Σ.  Which is why all those rectangles taken together will be equal to the rectangle under Σ and the other straight lines will be equal to all tangents taken together. Whence, as this is true regardless of how many rectangles and tangents exist, and as the figure is composed of parallelograms, if their number is increased towards infinity, it will turn into the surface A G H I K L F, and similarly the tangents will turn into the curved line A B C D E, and it is obvious that the surface A G H I K L F is equal to the rectangle under Σ and the straight line that is equal to the curve A B C D E.  q.e.d.  [Corollaries:]  But how from here the length of the given curved line can be investigated, will become clear in the following examples.  First, A B C D E be a curve of such a kind, that, if, after a point M on the line A F has been chosen at will and the perpendicular M C has been drawn, A M is called x and M C is called y, yy is always equal to x3/a. Then, given that A Q ≡ s, C Q ≡ v, and M I ≡ z: Q M = s - x, and its square (Q M)2 = ss - 2sx + xx. If the square of M C is  added to this, that is y y or x3/a, then one will arrive at ss - 2 sx + xx + x3/a = vv.  Because of the two equal roots, one multiplies according to the method of Huddenius by [0 1 2 3 0] and will find that - 2sx + 2xx + 3x3/a = 0.  Whence A Q or s = x + (3 xx)/(2 a). If from this A M = x is subtracted, M Q = (3 xx)/(2 a) remains, the square of which is (9 x4)/(4 aa). Add to this the (C M)2 or x3/a and (C Q)2 = (9 x4)/(4 aa) + x3/a will follow. Also, as C M = √(x3/a) will be to C Q = √((9 x4)/(4 aa) + x3/a), so will some other imagined line, e.g. 1/3 a (for it can be chosen at will), be to M I ≡ z and z = √(1/4 ax + 1/9 aa). This shows that the line G H I K L is a parabola, the vertex of which is in Δ, while A Δ = 4/9 a and the latus rectum = 1/4 a. And therefore the length of the curved line A B C D E is √(v3/a - 8/27 a), while Δ F = v.  Similarly, if yy = x3/a is replaced with the equation y4 = x5/a, or with y6 = x7/a, or with y8 = x9/a, and so forth into infinity: then, a surface A G H I K L F of that kind, that it can be quadrated, will always be found and therefore all such curves can be converted into a straight line.  If, however, A B C D E is a parabola, the axis of which is A G, and the latus rectum = a: then it will be found that M Q = 2x3/(aa) and that (M Q)2 =  4x6/a4. Add to this (C M)2 and 4x6/a4 + x4/(aa) = (C Q)2 will result. From here follows that as C M = (xx)/a is to CQ = √(4x6/a4 + x4/(aa)), so some imagined line, e.g. a, is to M I = z: and z = √(4 xx + aa), and that the line G H I K L is a hyperbola, the axis of which is the line A G, the focus of which is the point A, the latus rectum = 1/2 a, and the transverse axis = 2 a.   Which goes to show that the length of a parabolic curve cannot be found without finding the quadrature of the hyperbola, and vice versa.  The End.  edit: I don't have to mention that all the usual caveats regarding translations by people who don't have any clue what they are translating, apply, do I?"

As with most who know Latin it is the reading side that I have by far the most practice with. That said, if you can get oral instruction and practice, then go for it - it will be a huge boon to your understanding of the language and speed of learning.   The majority opinion on this subreddit is to recommend Orberg's Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata textbooks (and the accompanying materials by  L. Miraglia). I also like these books but believe even mediocre instruction in person to be preferable to self-study with the greatest materials; that's an opinion some quality posters on this sub probably won't share (as they might believe that bad instruction can lastingly damage your way of thinking about the language, e.g. by making you regard Latin sentences as puzzles to be solved according to some grammatical rulebook).   My advice would be to first look into institutions such as Vivarium Novum, Paideia and Polis  (there also is some new Italian provider of summer courses featuring spoken Latin but I forget the name and can't find the email advertising it) - maybe one of them fits your financial means and schedule. Paideia also offers online classes. Failing that, I'd look into local classes (maybe at universities? I don't know how such things work wherever you live - here in Germany we have public schools for continuing education [""Volkshochschulen""] that amongst many other subjects usually also offer Latin classes) and, once you have some basics, private tutoring (very hit & miss: Bachelor degrees are a poor indicator of language competency and many tutors are less than competent, but on the other hand at my university a Vivarium Novum alumnus has just started to offer private tutoring and his students will probably not even realize how lucky they are). Only if this also doesn't turn up any viable options, then I'd start to think about unguided study."

latin,3bhgvh,Flavus516,3,Mon Jun 29 21:02:01 2015 UTC,"Not annoying at all. I was referring to a bigger speed of learning with regard to Latin, not in general. The more natural Latin becomes to you, the better your mind becomes at adding to your knowledge of it.  After three years or so in school I had decent theoretical knowledge of the grammar of Latin but my memory was a sieve and I couldn't have quoted you a single line from any Latin author I had read. Today my memory is nowhere near what it could be but after I have read a text I'll now at least recall the more memorable turns of phrase (e.g. the ""vale et perge amare // ex asse tuum // [name]"" ending of the letter introducing your text; or its use of prelum for printing press in the phrase ""pr(a)elo dignum""; or the ""non ommitendum duxi, quin ..."") and sometimes shorter sentences (e.g. today I was reminded of the ""who kills by the sword..."" place from Revelations which I had looked up in the Vulgate last week and I'm confident that it is ""qui in gladio occiderit, eum gladio occidi oportet. hic est patientia et fides sanctorum."" or something very close to it).  As Latin grammar is quite compact (and 95% of it are usually covered after 2-3 years of classes) becoming better at Latin comes to a large part down to intangibles: getting a feeling for different ways of structuring thoughts & sentences, absorbing vocabulary and idioms, developing a faculty of stylistic judgment, ... These things are learned by contact with Latin (rather than from textbooks) and the ability to read reasonably swiftly (rather than spend minutes translating single sentences), to recall what you have read (without painstakingly memorizing flashcards) and to reproduce what you can recall in your own writing and speech are very important to your speed of learning."

One can avoid confusion when presented words such as this by committing to memory the present active infinitive, or, second principal part. One can recognize the pluperfect not just by the ending, in this case '-erat', but also by what is called a perfective aspect marker. For many verbs of the first conjugation, you will notice a -v- being used to distinguish the perfect from the present. So, while you may see 'vituperat' and think that you are looking at a pluperfect, the pluperfect form would look like 'vituperaverat' with that 'v' inserted to avoid confusion. By learning the second principal part, this can be avoided in the future (or, pluperfect, in this case). I found that verbs with bases longer than I was used to caused confusion. But if you remember that to form the pluperfect, you must add the appropriate ending to the perfect stem, or, third principal part and not the first, then I think the confusion could be avoided.   tl;dr: Memorize the principal parts of troublesome verbs and some of your troubles will disappear. Also, try your best to recognize those perfective aspect markers (what distinguishes the perfect from of a verb from the present from)."
latin,3bf5e3,ConfoditeCornua,3,Sun Jun 28 18:01:57 2015 UTC,"You've struck on a category error.  All pluperfect 3rd person singular indicative active verb forms end in -erat.  Bot not all verb forms that end in -erat are 3rd person singular indicative active.  You can also error-check yourself short of looking in a dictionary.  Look at the part of the verb before the ""erat""... Is it a verb stem you know?  If not, does it look similar to a third principal part of any verb you know?  Does it end in -u-, -v-, -x-, or -s?  That's a decent sign.  Does it have a long vowel like incēperat?  Then look at the context.  Does a pluperfect make sense in context?  Pluperfect usually shows up in the context of narrating a sequence of events already being described with the perfect tense.  If every other verb around your possibly pluperfect verb is in the present tense, it's much less likely to be pluperfect."

Someone new to english may think that ""wither"" is someone who ""with""s, but ""wither"" is the actual verb, which just happens to end with ""er"", so the proper agent form is ""witherer"".    I suppose the only way to notice these is to just remember the words, and when unfamiliar, look it up (use whitakers).  Context helps too.

latin,3bdcz9,MeyerIII,4,Sun Jun 28 03:48:47 2015 UTC,"It's a section from Cicero's philosophical work De Finibus.  Here's the Loeb translation (via LacusCurtius):   On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain emergencies and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

Its syntax, in short, needs some more training.  I said interdictae above.  You might also consider vetitae.  I honestly can't think of a difference other than which Roman officials used which verbs when they exercised their power to halt some activity.  Praetors (basically, military commanders with the power to decide lawsuits) would interdicere someone from doing something on threat of future punishment.

Additionally, we can learn a lot from comparative analysis. If we take the Romance words for dog, for example, we have Italian cane, French chien, archaic Spanish can (which has been superseded by perro, from a different root), Portuguese cão, and Romanian ciine. If we know how all of these sound, we can backtrack and use what we know of how languages change (and how Latin turned into the Romance languages) to reconstruct with a fair amount of accuracy how canis must have sounded in classical Latin. For example, in none of these words does the sound of English ay make an appearance, and so it is highly unlikely that such a sound existed in the Latin version of the word. As three out of five of them preserve the sound of ah, though Portuguese nasalizes it, this is likely the original sound of Latin -- an idea heavily bolstered when you're looking at comparisons of thousands and thousands of words rather than just one."

Or he was confused by dictionary entries including ""to add to sth"" for accedere, which, however, is pretty much limited to the formula ""accedit ut/quod"" that is often rendered as ""add to this, that"". As in: ""Certainly I'm the most miserable of all: I'm hungry, cold and penniless. Add to this, that I also broke my leg."" - ""Sine dubio sum miserrimus omnium: esurio, algeo, pecunia egeo. Accedit, quod crus fregi."" (literally: ""It comes towards/joins [the other reasons] that I broke my leg"").              edit: the phrase is all over the internets and apparently originates from the 1990 book ""Latin for all Occasions"" by Henry Beard. Wikipedia says ""Beard is known as a humorist but studied Latin for eight years at Harvard. He wrote the Latin himself, but had it checked and polished by scholars Mark Sugars and Winifred Lewellen."" I don't even.  edit2: Seriously, even one of the examples on the Wikipedia page is fucked up (beyond the general lack of idiomaticness). For the ""again"" in ""Oh! Was I speaking Latin again?"" (rendered as ""Vah! Denuone Latine loquebar?"") you would certainly not say denuo (contracted form of ""de novo""; as in ""I have to do it all over again""; or ""Try again!"", Menge §492: ""Denuo signifies that an action did initially fall short of its goal and is therefore regarded as if it had never happened""; cf. Döderlein/Arnold, Dumesnil/Gosset)."

I can think of three options:   Give up on the perfect pun with 'sano'. Family mottos can work without having the exact surname in the Latin. vero sanus [with or without 'sum'] would be a perfectly cromulent motto for a family named Sano. If you really want 'I am healthy' in there, have a longer motto with sano in a different part. sanus sum, qui veritate sano. I am healthy, who heal with truth.  Go for an alternate motto. Maybe one that includes 'I heal', so you can use the verb sano.    You could also play around with corpore sano - veritas in corpore sano? Truth in a healthy body?  Or make yourself dative. sanitas/veritas [datur] mihi sano - soundness/truth [is given] to me, healthy. ('Me, healthy' sounds weird in English but it's a common construction in Latin.) To an English ear, this also sounds like 'Soundness/truth is given to me, Sano'. (Though in Latin you'd use the dative of the name Sano for that, which would be third declension, so something like Sanoni.)  (edit: formatting, argh.)"

Sister: ""It's not supposed to make sense. The character even says it doesn't make sense.""  Reeds: ""Oh I'm sorry, am I supposed to assume that she understands the Latin?

latin,3ar81u,hlly,5,Wed Jun 24 13:13:34 2015 UTC,"Thought for sure this would be about the number of m/f/n nouns in the language.   A lot of older people in the US (65+) learned Latin as a matter of normal schooling that has sadly fallen out of practice for a myriad of reasons. There's no other group of people so universally interested/once trained in the language I've ever run into in this country like old folks. Male, female, didn't matter. Problem is most of them learned when Hitler was still alive. It's an interesting tidbit.   Meanwhile, at least here on Reddit, it seems like there's a lot more dudes. Maybe /u/translostation can chime in with his experience at AVN."
latin,3ar81u,ReedsAndSerpents,4,Tue Jun 23 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"AVN during the academic year was obviously (occasional visitors excepted) entirely male, at least while I was there. Once upon a time they accepted female students as well, and rumor has it they plan on doing so again in the future, but for now the regular student body is all guys. During the summer program the gender distribution is much more mixed and I'd say it comes close to 50/50. There were also a number of female students who visited from other schools/programs in Europe from time to time, so it wasn't as if we didn't run into anyone else out there.   In my experience attending events here in the U.S. the gender distribution is almost 50/50, and if we look specifically at high school teachers perhaps even a bit skewed to the female side. At least that's what my recollection of Paideia events and Conventicula tell me. That said, I don't know if it's about the active Latin movement itself or the fact that women just tend to predominate in U.S. K-12 teaching.   In terms of looking at scholarship, my experience has said that among individuals publishing at length in Latin, males predominate by a significant margin. Just consider the names of the usual ""Who's who"" and this pattern becomes apparent - Miraglia, Foster, Tunberg, Stroh, Sacre, Von Albrecht, Owens, and Cepalek are all men. Minkova and Lewellyn are two of a very few female names that come to mind (excluding e.g. Hallett who doesn't publish much beyond honoraria). I think this may have a fair amount to do with university admission policies and the number of women taken into graduate programs a few decades ago more than it does a gendered interest in active Latin. There are lots of young up and coming scholars interested in active usage from both groups (e.g. Fontaine and Whittington), and I personally know a large number of young women involved heavily in programs with Paideia and Kentucky. Foster's classes also seem to be pretty evenly balanced from what I hear.   This evidence is all, obviously, anecdotal and subject to the flaws and caprices of my memory, so take it cum grano salis."

latin,3ar81u,Arkellian_Pilot,3,Tue Jun 23 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"In the US, high school Latin is very gender balanced. At the university level, it felt like there were slightly more boys 10 or 15 years ago, but things have evened out considerably too. These are just anecdotal observations that should be taken with a mountain of salt. It is definitely the case that previous generations of Classicists had fewer women, just as nearly all academic disciplines had due to sexism."
latin,3ar81u,infinitum17,3,Mon Jun 22 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"I first studied Latin at an all-girls high school, so naturally all the Latin students I knew back then were female.   I checked my list of high schools offering Latin in my state (Victoria, Australia), and it turns out that there is an even number of single-sex boys and girls schools offering Latin at high school level, so I would tentatively guess that the gender ratio of high school Latin students is roughly even in my state. (I haven't compared the relative sizes of these schools, however, or the size of Latin departments within schools.)  At university, I wasn't very attentive to the gender ratio, but I believe it was slightly in favour of girls most of the time. And while females somewhat outnumbered males in Latin, there was at least a greater proportion of males in my Latin classes than in most other Humanities subjects.   When I did fourth year (it's called Honours in the University of Melbourne, and you write a 15,000 word thesis), there were three Classics Honours students and all of us were female. But this year's Honours class is one female, one male, and sadly they seem to never hang out together and get the camaraderie that we had when we were in Honours. I think at least if they had one more student of either gender they'd be much better company together.  The two teachers at my high school were male and female. Earlier this year when I went to the state-wide Latin teachers conference, I found a fairly even ratio of male and female teachers, though the older age bracket was more weighted to the males. But when I worked as part of a pilot project for introducing Latin to primary schools, our team of (about six) primary Latin teachers/volunteers was entirely female! I found that weird.  At uni, the lecturers in the Classics department were two guys and (briefly) one female, and they tend to run the second and third year Latin subjects. (The female lecturer has since left and joined a different university, leaving only two male professors in the Classics department.) There's also a female adjunct and a male postgrad who, together, run the First-year Latin subjects.   I heard members of my all-female primary Latin team (mostly postgrad students hoping to get into academia) complain that the University positions are mostly filled by men, but I disagree with their conclusions that this inequality of outcomes is purely the product of inequality of opportunity. They mentioned, with some disdain, that men sacrifice more of their time in working and consequently achieve more things, while most women (themselves excepted) tend to want to spend time on family and relationships. My take is that the lifestyle of academia is not very good if you want to have a family, especially for that brutal ten-year period when you're moving continents every year trying to land a tenured position. If a large proportion of women (or men) don't want to choose that life, all power to them. Gender ratios are less important to me than people's job satisfaction. Let individuals choose their lifestyle.  But it still remains that more women are graduating with Classics degrees than men, even though fewer women than men ultimately end up in academia (at least in my university). My prediction is that the high school teaching side of Latin will probably have a greater influx of women in the next generation or so, seeing that the slight majority of students in uni Latin are female."

That said, I really think we need to develop standards and produce a proficiency assessment that aligns with CFRL and ACTFL standards so that we can actually evaluate students' abilities objectively. Given that either of those scales distinguish proficiency by performance area (e.g. the communication strands: interpersonal, presentational, interpretational-reading, interpretational-listening), any such scale would likely be incredibly adaptive and robust, allowing for its use in both traditional (reading/writing centered) and more modern-method oriented (CI and natural method) classrooms."

latin,3aq2d1,Glofkill,11,Mon Jun 22 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"This is a wonderful word that is preserved with few changes in most of the Romance langauges:    Language Word for ""Flour""    (Latin) (Farina)   French Farine   Spanish Harina   Portuguese Farinha   Italian Farina   Romanian Făină    This also demonstrates a few of the sound changes that went into turning Latin into the Romance languages.   Is that a word-final /a/ in Latin?  Boom, now it's spelled with an <e> in French (and not pronounced). Is that a word-initial /f/ in Latin?  Poof!  It's probably spelled <h> in Spanish, and also not pronounced at all.  Some weird exceptions exist, though, because of rampant reborrowing, e.g. el humo (the smoke) but  fumar (to smoke). Final /a/ in Latin was raised to something more like the English ""uh"" sound in Portuguese, which also affects the consonants before it.  /n/ before word final /a/ becomes a sound most English speakers know as the /ñ/ or Spanish, which is spelled <nh> in Portuguese. Italian keeps the Latin form all nice and clean. Was there a single /r/ between two vowels in Latin?  They got rid of those in Romanian.  And Romanian marks short /a/ with a little breve mark because, although the length distinction was lost long ago, the the short /a/ had already raised to an ""uh"" sound like it did at the end of Portuguese.  Hence those <ă>s.  This is another way that we can tell that farina had a short /a/ at the beginning.   There are other fun romance languages, of course, like Rumansch and Walloon, but there's our fun introduction.  But by just looking at all these words above, accounting for the fact that most sound changes have directionality (/a/ is more likely to become ""uh"" than the other way around) and applying a ""majority rules"" strategy, you can see how we'd be able to tell that the Latin word was ""farina"" with a short first syllable even if we hadn't had a written record of Latin.  If you can see that, you're already way ahead for when you take historical linguistics 101."

Do you want to know how far the rest of the word had evolved phonetically by the time the prefix was added?  It seems it wasn't added until 13th-century Middle English, by which time the main part had become ""vail"" and the grammar of the word was in line with the Middle English of the time.  In terms of the evolution of its meaning, it's fairly clear:   Latin valeo, be strong. Latin valeo, be effective or powerful. Latin valeo, be worth.  (e.g. ""this ox is effective, to the measure of X coins"" = ""this ox is worth X coins"".) Old French valoir, be worth or useful Middle English vailen Middle English availen Modern English avail, to be useful Modern English avail oneself, to make useful for oneself   As for the meaning of the prefix, you seem to be saying it's Latin ad.  That's unlikely.  A- has many origins and meanings in English, not all of the easy to discern.  It is probably from Old English on-, probably with some intensifying effect.  It looks like the a- in acknowledge, which is a modification of know[ledge] in much the way that recognosco is a modification of cognosco.  Verbs very often slip around in their transitivity.  Americans almost inexplicably hate ""on"" and beat ""on"" people these days, where these verbs were always straightforwardly transitive.  If an ox brings you advantage, and you bring yourself advantage by getting an ox, then it seems to me that an ox avails you, and you avail yourself by getting one.  That's a short step to saying you avail yourself of the ox, i.e. get it and use it."

If you help or benefit something, you bring it to a state of well-being. (ad + valere).  See also the noun definition of the word (""to no avail"" = to a state of not being well).  And when you say you ""avail yourself"" of something, you're using it to your well-being.  ""I availed myself of the toilets"" means ""I brought myself to well-being by using the toilets.""

Incuria with its privative prefix would then be the abstracted idea of a lack of cura, but not necessarily related directly to curia despite the similar form.  Again, I haven't consulted any scholarly resources for this guess, this is only my own hypothesis and I would readily yield to a more authoritative response.  edit: I should have added that it's possible that curia actually has an entirely different etymological root than cura and incuria."

The idea of owing something back came along for the ride and eventually came to predominate in use.  The semantic jump from ""owing [someone] [a thing]"" to ""owing [someone] [an action]"" is a relatively small and common one across languages.  In English, after all, we don't just owe money and borrowed kettles; we also owe favors and promises.  From there, debere came to mean ""should"" or ""ought to"" or ""must"" when used with an action: It went from being under a moral or financial obligation to do something (and omitting mention to whom) to merely referring to moral or financial obligation with the ""to whom"" being altogether optional."

This depends on what style of pronunciation you're planning on using.  In reconstructed Classical pronunciation (the best guess we have at how Latin was spoken at the end of the Republic by, e.g., Cicero and Caesar) says <ae> is pronounced as a diphthong not unlike the English word ""I"" or the vowel in ""tide.""  So... <amicae> is a-MEE-kye.   2. Pluralis dativus and ablativus for same word are read [amicis]?   Yes.  For every word (I can't think of any exceptions), the plural dative and ablative forms are written and pronounced the same.  Because of this, some people even say that in the plural there is no distinction between the dative and the ablative.  But don't say that to your Latin teacher.   3. Is there any reliable source for checking how to read words in latin?   Latin has straightforward phonetic spelling, so you don't really need one.  There are a few unusual exceptions to the accent rules (e.g., the accent is on the final syllable of huc and illuc) but otherwise, you can always tell how to pronounce a word based on its spelling.  Good dictionaries will have long marks to let you know which vowels are long.  Once you're a little more comfortable with the language, you might want to pick up a copy of Allen's Vox Latina, which is a simple summary of research into the phonetics of Classical Latin.  It's fairly approachable and does a good job of explaining the basics to an audience of Classicists without the benefit of a background in comparative linguistics or phonetics."

latin,3accyr,beansworth,2,Fri Jun 19 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely ergo.   The then in your typical if/then construct employs, I would think, a marginal and almost incorrect facet of the polysemic then, which spends much of its life in a temporal realm with only brief incursions on the logical side of things, confusing succession with causation. We usually don't care as long as many programs are linear, but it becomes confusing in contexts like multi-threading, parallel computing, remote procedure call.  Anyway, if you seek Latin translations of the English then (and Google does a surprisingly good job on that, for once), you'll notice that most answers deal with either time or location more than logical implication.  And now, not being a native speaker of English, and having learned to code before I could speak proper English or deal with proper logic, I wonder if English has a short adverb for properly expressing causation, the one that is expressed in formal logic by the symbol ⇒  Argh, now when I'll come across a if/then construct in a program, I won't be able to read the then as anything else that eventually, maybe... Good thing I mostly deal with DLang and JavaScript those days.  Moreover, as Descartes said :   Non posse a nobis dubitari, quin existamus dum dubitamus; atque hoc esse primum, quod ordine philosophando cognoscimus.  Sic autem reiicientes illa omnia, de quibus aliquo modo possumus dubitare, ac etiam falsa esse fingentes, facile quidem supponimus nullum esse Deum, nullum coelum, nulla corpora; nosque etiam ipsos non habere manus, nec pedes, nec denique ullum corpus; non autem ideo nos, qui talia cogitamus, nihil esse: repugnat enim, ut putemus id quod cogitat, eo ipso tempore quo cogitat, non existere. Ac proinde haec cognitio:  Ego cogito, ergo sum  est omnium prima et certissima, quae cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.   Long story short,   ergo   is the way to go.

It's just that the speaker gets the full satisfaction of victory when others don't do as well, therefore they ""must"" fail.

latin,3a5mns,correon,3,Wed Jun 17 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"""nescio qui sim"" is perfect for ""I know not who I am.""  ""significat id quod velis"" is also comprehensible, but it's a little awkward because of ""id quod"" having its own meaning and because of the ambiguities of whether id is the subject or object of that first verb.

latin,3a5mns,Alajarin,2,Wed Jun 17 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"Object. I think I get what was going on: there was a bit of interference from Spanish (another L2) which, unlike English, requires that you say 'lo que' (basically 'that which') rather than just 'que' (relative pronoun) - basically, you can't say 'it means what you want...' ('significa que quieras') that's broken Spanish, but only 'it means that which you want...' ('significa lo que quieras'). I think I extended that rule to Latin, which was why I put in the superfluous id. That said, I don't think it's technically incorrect since I have seen id quod used in this sense, and googling gives an example from de bello gallico: 'fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt' which seems to fit to me. There's no subject/object ambiguity there, admittedly, which does make my suggested phrase less graceful, so I would agree to remove the id."

It more seems that the other person was glossing from English.  I had to think for a while to work out what they meant.  They actually thought the id might be the ""it"" in ""it means"".  Of course it is the same as lo que."
latin,3a5mns,Correctrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:38:37 2015 UTC,"'significat id quod velis'    That's not an indirect question though, so no subjunctive.  There's ""it means that which you want [it to mean]"" as a relative clause and there's ""it means what you want it to mean"" as an indirect question.  Those are significat id quod vis and significat quid velis.  I think that the former is better for ""it means""."
latin,3a5mns,Alajarin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking of it as an indirect question, but this may indeed be interference from Spanish, which takes the subjunctive to mean 'whatever' basically, which is why it is 'lo que quieras' as opposed to 'quieres,' the indicative, if Latin does not do that. That said, it does have the sense of 'whatever you may wish it to mean' which to me would make sense to imply the subjunctive according to the idea of the subjunctive as 'doubt', 'uncertainty', although perhaps the old description of the subjunctive as 'doubt' etc. doesn't mean much and is just used to help students conceptualise it?  Anyway, here's a quote (admittedly in Modern Latin, but if you google 'quidquid subjunctive' you'll find classical examples) which seems to show the same usage in Latin: 'quidquid Latine dictum sit altum videtur' - here the subjunctive (sit) seems to be being used because of the 'whatever' meaning. In the original sentence in my opinion there is an implied whatever; really, the id quod is synonymous in this case with quidquid and the sentence is saying 'it means what(ever) you want it to mean', and so on the same basis as the subjunctive in the quidquid clauses it could be used here. But this could be irrelevant if this is not a hardfast rule regarding 'whatever' clauses but just that the word quidquid takes the subjunctive! God, it would be nice to have native speakers to quickly ask these things!!"
latin,3a5mns,Correctrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:04:18 2015 UTC,"Really there's barely any overlap between the use of the subjunctive in Latin and Spanish.   Cuando lleguen, pregúnteles qué quieren. Vbi advenient, roga quid velint.   Completely opposite in usage there.  Or:   Me alegro de que lo hicieras antes de que viniesen. Gaudeo te istud prius fecisse (or quod istud prius fecisti) quam venerunt.   Just as bad.  Or:   Cuando vi el carro, me sorprendió que la persona estuviera viva. Cum plaustrum vidissem, mirata sum hominem etiamtunc vivere.   Or:    ¡Menudo chubasco!  No dudo que lloverá todo el día. Qualis imber!  Non dubito quin totum diem pluturum sit.   Etc.   'quidquid Latine dictum sit altum videtur'    That's a joke phrase!  The use of the passive is off too.  ""Is said"" is dicitur, not dictum est/sit."
latin,3a5mns,Alajarin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:38:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, obviously Latin and Spanish subjunctives are very different. Re:the actual thing though, obviously it's a joke phrase but as I said you can find other citations of quidquid+subj. in Classical Latin: look here for example https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ey1HpxRErjEC&pg=PA988&lpg=PA988&dq=quidquid+subjunctive&source=bl&ots=7fFiBkDQTG&sig=YnrW39ZlkjQ07PtHDOe9P7XLqIg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X82CVeawI4q07ga5sIPQCQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=quidquid%20subjunctive&f=false . I'm not sure why the use of the passive is off to be honest, it's just not present but perfect as I'm sure you know, and since quidquid is neuter 'dictum est/sit' seems fine to me..."
latin,3a5mns,Correctrix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"I don't deny the subjunctive is occasionally possible in such sentences; but it's not at all as in Spanish, where the subjunctive is just plain obligatory in virtually every subordinate clause happening in the future.  In Spanish, you have to say stuff like Dame lo que te entreguen mañana whether you mean a simple ""Give me what they hand to you tomorrow"" or ""Give me whatever they may hand to you tomorrow.""  I think that Latin uses the subjunctive just as we use such nuances of vague whateverness in English: Spanish's profligate use of the subjunctive leads one astray.  The way they tried to construct the passive in that joke sentence, going word-for-word from ""is said"" to dictum sit, is rather off.  It resulted in them accidentally putting it in the perfect, because of course the present passive is a one-word affair in Latin.  They only got the present passive correct in the second part because of course they weren't really forming a passive, but just spitting out a word-for-word equivalent of ""seems""."
latin,3a5mns,Alajarin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"Alright then re:subj. I see what you're saying, that dictum sit could be a literal translation of 'is said'; the sentence didn't sound off to me with the perfect though, although I would likely have used present as well. What makes you so sure that it was an unintended anglicised translation rather than just a quirky style choice though; does the sentence with perfect passive sound very off to you in Latin?  P.S. Sorry for banging on about all this stuff!"

latin,3a0x53,Glofkill,4,Tue Jun 16 10:44:59 2015 UTC,"Not to be confused with pālus, -i (m.) (""pole,"" ""stake,"" or otherwise tall-thin-thing-poking-out-of-the-ground), this word is a lovely demonstration of syncope: the loss of sounds in the middle of a word.  First off, it's worth considering that -s is a pretty common nominative case ending in Latin.  It shows up in non-neuter 2nd, 4th, and 5th declension nouns.  But that /s/ sound also shows up in a large number of 3rd declension nouns!  Think rex (* reg + s), virtus, civis, pars, corpus, mos, pax (* pac + s), turris, moles, ars.  My etymology fun fact is about how the nominative forms of a Latin 3rd declension noun like palus are less irregular than you might have been taught.  Third declension nouns often (but not always) take a nominative ending -s appended to their root form.  In the case of paludis, the root is palud-.    Latin, however, was less tolerant of consonant clusters than English is.  Since they take effort to enunciate clearly, consonant clusters (like unstressed vowels) are a prime target for sound change.  And 3rd declension nominatives are a great example of how these sound changes happen.  When you add an -s to the end of palud-, you'd expect a form like * paluds.  That ds just doesn't look very Latiny, though, does it?  That's right.  You don't see it anywhere.  But we can be pretty sure, based on analogy with other words, that the -s was added as an inflectional ending.  So before Latin had a written record, then, there must have been a sound change to modify that consonant cluster.  Comparing palus with virtus and other similar words, we can figure out that the sound change must be something like this this: at the end of a word, a dental stop followed by s becomes an s.  In other words, if a Latin 3rd declension noun's stem ends in a t or a d, its nominative is likely to be the stem with the t or d deleted and an s in its place.  Similar sound changes caused g to devoice and become a /k/ sound (spelled <x>) and /b/ to devoice and become a /p/ sound before a nominative -s in 3rd declension nouns.  Can anyone think of fun examples?  My favorite inflected forms of palus?   palus paludem paludis"

E.g. in the Aeneid Poseidon gives his horses the bridle ""curru secundo"" (= ""curru sequente [sc. equos]"") and Aeneas tells his friends ""Durate et vosmet servate rebus secundis"" (imo = ""rebus sequentibus"", ""the things that are to come"" but most translate ""more favorable times"").

Look for key words close by in the passage to narrow down your choices.   ut non - gotta be result (noun clause or regular) cum - probably a cum clause (if not prep phrase) ut - you know it's not a indirect question or cum clause tam, ita, tot, tantus (-a, -um), talis - these words often proceed result clauses; if you see an ut and one of these words it's probably a result clause moneo, rogo, peto, hortor, persuadeo, impero - indirect commands verbs of asking, doubting, learning, knowing, telling, hearing- often indirect questions, look for forms of quis to confirm. efficio, permitto, accicio - noun clause of result (if you need to know conditionals) si - if it is anywhere (they can hide pretty good) it is probably a conditional. Use tense and mood to decided what type.    to help identify the types of cum clause (if you need to do so)   indicative with cum - temporal tamen and subjunctive and cum - probably adversative all the others ones you have to rely on context."

latin,39wh0o,MagisterTJL,16,Mon Jun 15 10:48:05 2015 UTC,"The Latin Vulgate is classical Latin; it's just much later than Golden Age Latin.  The differences are minor enough that you shouldn't worry. Sometimes I wonder why a certain word was chosen instead of another one. There are weird uses of the infinitive and subjunctive moods, and a lot of quod clauses. Some verbs take different objects than they did in Golden Age Latin (credere in +acc., rather than credere + dat.). Overall, it's not going to affect your reading too much; it will just be a different register than Cicero or Vergil.  My recommendation is to stick to the New Testament--Jerome's Latin seems better to me when he's translating from Greek, and the way he handles some Hebrew names can be frustrating."
latin,39wh0o,hectic33,8,Mon Jun 15 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing that sets the Vulgate apart from other Classical literature in general lies in its preference for certain constructions found less commonly in Classical Latin, that Jerome used to more literally translate from the Greek. For example, you'll often see quod/quia/quoniam used to introduce indirect speech rather than an accusative + infinitive construction; or a conjugation of sum with a participle to convey action in progress, e.g. orans eram rather than just orabam.   But by and large the Latin of the Vulgate is the same as Classical Latin, and you definitely aren't going to damage any skills by broadening your Latin horizon. If you want to know more about the topic I'd recommend reading A Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin by John F. Collins."

You should know that ""to save the date"" and ""to save the free republic"" aren't nearly the same - use notare or something similar. Bonus points if you can work in a future imperative (without making it sound ridiculous, i.e. certainly not notatote), it would imho be appropriate in this context.  matrimonium and conubium both refer to the marriage itself and not to the wedding ceremony. Confarreatio seems quite a bit overblown (are you going to be married by the pope or something?) and if your fiancée is a classicist she might point out to you that it refers to a marriage cum manu. There's nothing wrong with nuptiae for wedding.   You can go as simple as ""dies nuptiarum"" (but then you have a lot of genitives) or for something more fancy such as ""dies nuptiis dictus/destinatus"" (masculine/feminine is your choice but the sources uniformly use masculine here). Of course you can augment further if you want to, ""dies sollemnibus nuptiis celebrandis destinatus"" and so on - knock yourself out."

latin,39uauh,Jas1066,3,Sun Jun 14 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"You'll want to think about things such as word order and choice of words especially; think about whether any word has extra emphasis by putting it at the start or the end of a sentence, and you can also get marks for feature spotting things like alliteration and personification. It's been a while since I did the GCSE paper, and when I did it it was on the Pliny passage about ghosts, so there is a lot to mention in terms of stereotypical imagery, deliberately choosing words with sounds that match the mood, and so on.   If you're after particular language or rhetorical techniques to call upon, some of the big one's you will see are polyptoton (use of two words with the same original root -- strong and strength in English for example), asyndeton (no conjunctions), chiasmus (crossing of word class e.g. noun verb, verb noun), juxtaposition (putting two words next to each other for emphasis). The essay isn't all about feature spotting though, you should make sure you know what all these terms mean and be ready to explain them to the examiner if you want to use them.  Also, don't get bogged down in complicated terminology. You'll get just as many marks for noting chiasmus as you will for saying that a certain word choice is very emphatic, or that the content of the story is filled with suspense.   If I remember properly, and this is supported by looking at the mark schemes, your 8 mark essay should be mostly content based. You want to create an argument about the pros and cons of the texts you're comparing. Try to make a point about the text and back it up with content from the literature. For example, you could say that you find Livy's writing more interesting than Suetonius' because it is full of mystery and involves elements of mythology rather than hard fact. Of course the key to writing any good argument, long or short, is to make sure you balance it. You can extend the argument by taking the opposite view; ""Suetonius' writing also includes portends which mimic Caesar's death in a gory way, making it seem more descriptive."" One of the easiest way to snap up marks is to show the examiner you recall the story and can apply it to the question, try not to be too general but refer to particular elements or symbolism that the writers use which are relevant to the question."

That whole sea, long and wide, which is between Europe and Africa, is called 'our sea' by the Romans.  The city of Rome is not at the sea, but situated at the Tiber river twenty miles from the sea.

latin,39ht1g,crwcomposer,9,Thu Jun 11 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"In in the sense of ""according to"" takes the accusative.    Afaik ""credere in"" is a purely Christian invention, the in + accusative is generally understood as an accusative of movement.  Augustinus on the matter:   Hoc est opus Dei, ut credatis in eum quem ille misit. Ut credatis in eum; non, ut credatis ei. Sed si creditis in eum, creditis ei: non autem continuo qui credit ei, credit in eum. Nam et daemones credebant ei, et non credebant in eum. Rursus etiam de Apostolis ipsius possumus dicere, Credimus Paulo; sed non, Credimus in Paulum: Credimus Petro; sed non, Credimus in Petrum. Credenti enim in eum qui iustificat impium, deputatur fides eius ad iustitiam. Quid est ergo credere in eum? Credendo amare, credendo diligere, credendo in eum ire, et eius membris incorporari.    Or Thomas in his commentary on Lombardus' Sententiae: ""Praeterea, cum dicitur credere in Deum, designatur finis fidei."" In the Summa he elaborates that, whereas ""credere Deum"" and ""credere Deo"" both view the object of faith purely from the intellect, ""credere in Deum"" views it from the intellect moved by the will, as God/the first truth has the character of an end (and to be moved towards an end pertains to the will). In short: ""[...] voluntas movet intellectum et alias vires animae in finem. Et secundum hoc ponitur actus fidei credere in Deum.""  In modern languages ""to believe in"" has been used so inflationary as to become meaningless. In Latin, however, the strangeness of this locution remains much more evident and as such I would only use it when ""to believe towards [some end]"" can actually be given a sensible interpretation."

Clāvis probably derives from a common root with the word claudō -āre -ere (ht: /u/bitterlatinist), which means ""to close,"" but the etymology is hard to confirm without historical evidence or more cognates in other Indo-European languages  The Greek word ἡ κλείς (τῆς κλείδος) (""key"") seems actually be cognate to clāvus, which means ""nail"" or ""pin,"" and this could maybe have been a source for a very old borrowing.  The world may never know.  But this is as good a time as any to remind everyone that clāvis is an i-stem 3rd declension noun, and so the Romans were a little loose on what it's endings ought to be.  The genitive plural is certainly always clāvium.  In older sources, you'll see the accusative singular clāvim, although clāvem comes to dominate later.  The ablative singular is frequently clāvī, although clāve is also widely used.  I'm not finding quick sources for whether clāvīs was ever used as an accusative plural, but I strongly suspect that it was.

Both clāvus and κλείς are apparently from PIE *kleh₂u (key, hook, nail). That would mean that clāvis either directly descends from κλείς, or is cognate to it. Is there a third possibility?

Yeah, but all the other possibilities suck worse than those options.  I mean, I am a little skeptical of the ancient borrowing story because the Greek presence in middle-Italy was not that extensive.  it's still definitely a possibility.  Though kleis -> clavis does not seem like a normal sound change progression to me.  Where'd the /v/ come from?  Maybe the Greek word had a digamma I don't know about...  As for the clavus -> clavis theory, it's also unusual to find i-stem endings glomming onto an o-stem root.  I'm having trouble thinking of other examples.    Other options: It could also be a reborrowing from a close-by related Italic language that had some sound changes that made clavus sound kinda like clavis to the Latins.  Maybe it was Umbrian or Faliscan or something.  I have literally no evidence for this.  It could be a remnant of a compound.  Making up a morpheme -vi-, it could have derived from something like: clau- (close) + -vi- (???) + -s (nom.) = clavis?  It would make sense, but what the heck is that vi?  I don't know anywhere else where that happened in Latin either.  So I also have no evidence for this theory.  I'm certain we could dream up a few more if we want.

latin,39a9ui,rakeswell,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"Apollo et Hyacinthus:       Apollo et Hyacinthus is an opera, K. 38, written in 1767 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was 11 years old at the time. It is Mozart's first true opera (when one considers that Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebotes is simply a sacred drama). It is in three acts. As is suggested by the name, the opera is based upon Greek mythology as told by Roman poet Ovid in his masterwork Metamorphoses. Interpreting this work, Rufinus Widl wrote the libretto in Latin.  The opera was first performed on 13 May 1767 at the Great Hall, Salzburg University.  The myth follows that Hyacinth died accidentally from being struck on the head by a discus thrown by Apollo. However, another myth tells that it was the wind god Zephyrus who was actually responsible for Hyacinth's death because Zephyrus, out of jealousy, blew the discus off course in order to injure and kill Hyacinth. When he died, Apollo made the hyacinth flower spring out from his spilled blood.  The librettist and priest, Rufinus Widl, modified Ovid's story (in which Apollo, Zephyrus, and Hyacinthus clearly constituted a homosexual love triangle) to make it conform to the ethic, by changing the sexually desired character from Ovid's Hyacinth to Melia, his sister.

latin,39b1md,Glofkill,7,Wed Jun 10 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"The use of the letter <Y> is a tip-off that Latin borrowed this word from Greek.  The use of /ps/ in the middle of the word is also a good hint, though it's less reliable than seeing a <Y>.  (See, e.g., ipse.)  But regardless, it totally did come from the Greek word κλεψύδρα, which also means ""water clock"" but comes from a compound noun meaning something like ""water thief.""   This etymology makes a little more sense when you understand that a water-clock was basically a cup or bucket with a small hole in it.  To measure time, you pour an amount of water into it.  When the dripping stops, time is up.  Think of it as half an hourglass, only with water instead of sand.  Clepsydrae were used in Roman law courts to constrain the amount of time each advocate could speak, and important or capital cases meant more water.  And unlike an hourglass, it's pretty easy to stop a clepsydra if you need to, say, pause for lunch: just plug up the hole!  Because Metonymy is a thing, clepsydra and aqua came to be used as words for ""time for speaking"" in the courts.  So petere clepsydram or aquam petere meant ""to ask for time to speak"" and clepsydram dare or aquam dare meant ""to grant permission/time to speak.""  As a nerdy lawyer, I find this word interesting for all kinds of professional reasons, but I hope you all think it's a pretty neat piece of usage regardless.  Being Greek and therefore foreign sounding, clepsydra has all sorts of fun inflected forms to say out loud:   clepsydrae clepsydrarum clepsydra   And don't forget how to pronounce your <Y>s!

What this tells us is that you have not yet internalized the grammatical system of the language. This is common in Latin students because they study Latin in a language-poor environment where they aren't exposed to the right quantities and types of linguistic input to move them toward actual internalization and language competency. The only way for you to solve that problem is to get input, and in particular to get that input on a level that you can readily understand. Lingua Latina and other basic readers are perfect for that, and are most definitely the best way to develop the sort of fluency you want more quickly. Avoid classical authors in your extensive reading until you feel comfortable just reading them. You get more out of working with things you find to be simple."

latin,39abhl,Ian666,2,Wed Jun 10 11:37:33 2015 UTC,"The old romans love the sons of their homeland, help their neighbors, stay away from bad friends and good wine, teached their neighbors to surround their citiy with walls.   That would be  Romani antiqui suae patriae filios amant, socios iuvant, amicis malis et vinis bonis abstinent, finitimos muris oppidum munire docebant.   why would they stay away from good wine? have i got this right?   It's called sarcasm ;)   arcere = to surround    that's your problem, try different meanings (dictionary).   The able man Demetrius, captured in a greek citiy destroyd by the Romans, was for a long time not content with his fate, but more and more he was a good teacher to the roman boys.   fine.   He often showed old books, ornated with beautiful paintings, to the boys.   fine.   ""libros antiqous"" is what he showed to the boys. But I'm not sure about ""tabulis pulchris ornatos"". tabulis & pulchris are dat. or abl. pl., i guess abl. pl, but ornatos is acc. pl. What is going on here?   ornatos is in agreement with libros. If you leave out ""tabulis pulchris"" for a moment, you get ""Saepe pueris libros antiquos ornatos monstrabat"" - ""Often he showed the boys old, adorned books""; all the ablative does, is explain ""ornatos"" (""How were the books adorned?"" - ""adorned with beautiful paintings"").

latin,39abhl,bitterlatinist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"First, THANK YOU!

Oh, right, totally overlooked that. Its libros antiquos ornatos and tabulis pulchris as a description of with what the books are ornated.     Your translation is fine but   Hmm, i think you might be right, that my latin-translation is wrong and not the english translation. Let me think again:  Libenter liberis de Aenea probo dominae incolisque Libyae amico narrabat.   (libenter liberis de ... narrabat): He gladly told the kids about ... (Aenea probo dominae incolisque Libyae amico) ist what he told the kids about Aenea is Abl. Sing. probo and amico is either Dat. or Abl. Sing. dominae is either Gen. or Dat. Sing., or Nom. Plur.  incolis is either Dat. or Abl. Plur. As de stands only with Abl., meaning ""about"", the story he told must be about... Aenea probo, incolis(que) and amico, because only they could be Abl.?... so... ""he told about brave Aeneas and the friendly people of Lybia""... but what about dominae? wait... amico is a noun, right, Abl. Sing. from amicus, -i, m. is it: ""he told about brave Aeneas, friend of the lady of Libyia and (friend of) the people of syria""?   I think I'm lost with this one."
latin,39abhl,bitterlatinist,2,Wed Jun 10 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"I'm lost with this one, could i have another hint?   It's just a very small matter that I was concerned about, so I'm just going to spill the beans:  Compare:  Aeneas est amicus dominae et incolorum.  and  Aeneas est amicus dominae et incolis.  English can reflect this difference in cases by using ""friend of"" (genitive) and ""friend to"" (dative). In German we can only express the dative in combination with sein (""Er ist den Römern ein Freund""), in more complex structures we have to use the genitive.  So whereas in English you can signal that you have recognized the Latin dative by writing ""he told them about Aeneas, friend to the queen and the locals"", in German you are stuck with ""er erzählte ihnen von Aeneas, dem Freund der Königin und der Einwohner""."

latin,395bc2,Glofkill,21,Tue Jun 9 10:43:42 2015 UTC,"Whoa!  Two days in a row when the Verbum diei provides great hidden evidence that people actually spoke Latin with their mouths.  Sumptus is interesting because of its relation to the verb sumo (sumere sumpsi sumptum), which means ""to take, get, undertake, spend, assume, buy, charm, etc.""  (Oh my!)  This particular fourth declension noun clearly derives from the ""spend"" meanings that sumo developed.  But if the root is sum, and supine forms add a -tu- where the heck did that that /p/ come from?!?  Epenthesis.  ""But wait,"" you say, ""I thought /u/correon said yesterday that sound changes in language tend to smooth out sounds like turning /b/ to /p/ before a /t/: how can adding another consonant make anything simpler ever?""  The answer is kind of fun.  Although one might predict that the /m/ in a form like * sumtus would have become an /n/, that's not what we ended up seeing... (perhaps because there is too much meaning riding on that one little /m/).  Instead, we got a textbook epenthesis: a sound halfway between the two sounds sort of crept in there to make the transition from /m/ to /t/ somewhat smoother.  /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal.  /t/ is a voiceless dental stop.  And, lo, /p/ is a voiceless bilabial stop.  In other words, the voicing on the /m/ tended to shorten in anticipation of the voiceless consonant coming up.  This left a gap between the /m/ sound and splitting the lips so the speaker could release the /t/ sound... a gap that happens to sound exactly like a /p/.  Hence... sum- (cost) + -tu- (supine) + s (inflection) =  sumptus.  Because epenthesis.  Because I've always found the fourth declension very fun to use, sumptus has some very amusing inflected forms:   sumptuum sumptū   EDITS: fxiing an few tpyos.

Knowing the pieces of the word, you would expect scrib(e/i)- (write) -t- (perfect participle) and -um (inflection).  Whatever short little vowel may once have hung out between the b and the t long ago dropped out because it was so short and unimportant-sounding anyway.  Saying it every time was more work than it was worth, and so Latin was left with those two consonants basically right next to each other.  But having a voiced bilabial /b/ sound right before an unvoiced dental /t/ sound is another quite awkward thing.  And awkward sounding bits like that are usually the first things to get worn away by language change.  So the /b/ became more like the /t/ and lost its voicing to become a /p/ sound before /t/.  The same sound change happened for the same reason before the agentive morpheme -tor.

The best primer out there that I know of is Bernhard Bischoff's Latin Paleography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1990). It introduces you to the various hands, abbreviations, and manuscript genres that you'll encounter in working with manuscripts. Raymond Clemens's Introduction to Manuscript Studies is also very good and has lots of illustrations of the hands. The most useful resource out there for medieval abbreviations is Cappelli's Dictionary of Latin Abbreviations. The introduction is in Italian, but the important stuff's all Latin anyway. You can also find Cappelli's dictionary as a plug-in inside T-PEN (Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation).  If you prefer to start online (or just for free), there are lots of online resources too. The UK National Archives has a tutorial online, and I think they also have some explanatory material as well. As you get more comfortable with it, I recommend using something like T-PEN to just start experimenting. Some scholars prefer to use pen and paper to transcribe their materials, but I find that using T-PEN makes the process much faster and often more accurate. I believe there are other transcription tools out there, but I haven't used them.   There are lots more resources as well, but these are the ones I've found most helpful."

There's some memorization to do for endings and for verbs, but the gender system is simpler than other European languages, and the amount of memorization of irregular verb forms is also lower.  If you know Spanish or Italian, the verb forms will be a little easier to memorize and the vocabulary will be pretty quick.  If you know Russian, the noun and adjective inflections will seem laughably easy.  If you know German or French, you will do a little dance when you realize how often you can tell the gender of a noun just by looking at it.  But as with any new language, there will always be some complicated quirks in that you'll need to learn afresh.  Let us know how it's going and how we can be of help."

""How do I know?"" is an indirect question: ""You are asking, how I know?"" Also in Latin ""whence"" sounds more to the point than ""how"". I don't like to begin sentences with ""nam"", it always sounds rough to me; no particular insight into Latin style, just a preference possibly stemming from my native language. If ""ipse feci"" is too laconic for your taste then you could add an ""enim"" (""ipse enim"" makes for a nice elision). But I like brevity here. ""et ego"" is bad as ""et"" in this position means ""etiam"". Also the emphasis is ""And I am Caesar"", not ""And I am Caesar""; the name Caesar is used anachronistically as a title. The idea is ""For this is what I have done - and look where it got me!"". Expressing this ""name as a name and name as a title"" thing is challenging, ""Caesar sum"" is imo not clear enough, ""Caesar nunc sum"" wouldn't make much sense (he has had the name Caesar his entire life), ""Caesar appellor"" is the best I can come up with right now (it can be understood either way but it invites you to read Caesar as a title).

Aren't a state and a property pretty much the same, the only difference in your examples being how permanent it is? I don't believe the Romans saw a difference.

Then he, otherwise an eloquent man, fell silent because of the occurrence of this unexpected event and, all pathos lost (frigidissime), carried his little daughter back.  (Quintilian VI.1.39)  Technically, infans is a present participle (even has ""infante"" as an ablative, adjectives generally have an ablative in -i) meaning ""not-speaking"" (from fari - to speak). Present participles always have the same forms in the masculine and feminine (e.g. ""puer currens"" - the running boy; ""puella currens"" the running girl).

latin,38lop4,MagisterTJL,14,Fri Jun 5 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"I think this can be good news--it could serve as a wake up call that lets classics departments realize that classical languages, as currently taught, aren't worth taking. High school teachers are stepping up and adopting modern language teaching methods, but that change has been lacking in higher ed.  Students have figured out that if the highest level of skill you can hope to attain is translating 100 lines a night, there's no point in taking that language. We need to show students that Latin can be better than that. Still disheartening statistics, though, especially for us new teachers in the field."

latin,38lop4,vossbot,5,Fri Jun 5 12:18:17 2015 UTC,"I believe that the AP Latin course unfortunately reinforces this method; moreso than any other language AP (and the majority of APs produced in general), there is a rather rigid curriculum aimed at translating and analysing grammar and the methodology of poetry than actually enjoy the Aeneid and the Gallic War.  It stands in stark contrast to other language APs where there is more room for self-studying and the ability to comprend and write in the target language is more important than, as is mentioned elsewhere in the thread, looking at Latin as a code to analyse and break down."
latin,38lop4,vossbot,4,Sat Jun 6 01:16:25 2015 UTC,That's an awesome way to look at it. There is nothing I would love more than to see the classics approached with a fresh look and treated as living languages (or at least taught as such).
latin,38lop4,translostation,6,Fri Jun 5 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"My views have been changing, since I was brought up on fairly rigid grammar-translation. I've realized that my first 10 years of Latin education were practically worthless. From observing grammar-translation students, I've realized that it doesn't work at all for students outside of perhaps the top 10th percentile--I've encountered plenty of 3rd and 4th year students who can't even figure out on sight if a word is a noun or a verb! If that's what you get from a Latin education, it's worth nothing."
latin,38lop4,Ireallydidnotdoit,3,Fri Jun 5 01:15:26 2015 UTC,It's funny to me that I came by an understanding of grammar in Latin and German initially through Esperanto - the clear marking of grammatical parts set me up to attack bigger challenges; I came at it thus through grammar-translation. Perhaps things would have been different if I started out with a more natural method.
latin,38lop4,translostation,2,Fri Jun 5 02:26:22 2015 UTC,I felt the same way when I first started teaching and exploring alternative methods. It was a complete shock how little my students could actually do. What surprises me more though is the number of teachers (and professors!) who simply blame the students as if it were their own inability rather than the fact that we keep doing something that obviously doesn't work for the vast majority of people on the planet.
latin,38lop4,translostation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I've realized that it doesn't work at all for students outside of perhaps the top 10th percentile   Do we need more than that taking Classics? I'm not being mean or anything, just asking. Already, internationally, more departments produce Classics Majors than Classicists (yes, there is a massive difference). It's not as if there's a desperate need for more people doing it - why dilute the quality further?  There needs to be a distinction made between those studying towards Classical Philology and those picking up Latin and Greek for any other reason - usually just to read some literature and do some liberal arts stuff. Let's not pretend these need the same treatment.  I know this is a v. unpopular opinion here, but oh well. There's no one size fits all pedagogy."
latin,38lop4,MadeUAcctButIEatedIt,3,Fri Jun 5 07:58:43 2015 UTC,"I think the big issue is that for those the method doesn't work for, their skills amount to basically nothing when they're done. They've just wasted 3-4 years they could have spent studying Spanish, French, Chinese, etc. Instead, they scrape by in Latin, but can't read even a basic sentence. For those the method does work for, they read at rates considerably lower than that of their peers in modern language classes. How many classics majors could consistently read 200 lines a night? And these are the people who can understand Latin, theoretically."
latin,38lop4,Ireallydidnotdoit,3,Fri Jun 5 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"This is, in a nut shell, my hope (and the contents of a letter I sent to the SCS a few months ago). From a numbers-analysis side, I think the reality is that Classics just isn't viewed as an economically viable degree currently, especially in light of the recent recession, the focus on STEM fields, and the general standard American bent toward immediate utilitarianism. I'm not sure that any amount of reform can make the argument that Classics is immediately useful to a particular vocation, but I think that with the right adjustments we can at least make pursuing these subjects seem like a valuable use of one's time generally.  You're totally right that the very crux of the issue rests in our (speaking of the field) outdated pedagogy models and assumptions. Regardless of our goals (Is the point to just read Latin? Is the point to speak it too? etc.), the nails are being hammered into our coffin as we find out more and more that achieving any of those goals efficiently will largely be dependent on current models and methodologies that we simply refuse to address/employ. Comprehensible Input is, at this juncture, the basis of theory in SLA and we do nothing with it in our programs. The consequence is, as you note, that our students simply aren't developed enough with the languages to do anything at all at a worthwhile level.  The only other thing that I'd mention is that I think we need to consider our teaching and pedagogy beyond the simple demands of SLA and the more technical aspects of the language. I think one of the relevancy issues for the Classics is that we've been reading the same damn stuff for millennia and that the 'corpus' we engage with represents about 0.1% of 0.1% of extant Latin sources. We need to start engaging the entire tradition if we want to generate truly novel philological works and escape the mire that has become Critical Theory in Classics - you know, where we beat dead horses that we've dressed up to look different from the time(s) we beat them previously."
latin,38lop4,BuiltLikeTaft,3,Fri Jun 5 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we have to be cautious of the other extreme, as well. If you're taking a Spanish class, you're taking it to communicate with Spanish speakers. Any literary goals are probably secondary to the primary objective of communication. When you take a Latin class, you do so to engage with literature. Speaking is the best way to do that, but communication is a means, not an end.  Any idea what's being done with classical languages other than Latin and Greek? Do Coptic, Old Norse, Sanskrit etc. have the same pedagogical issues as Latin and Greek?  I'd also imagine that things are worse for Greek--with Latin, there's a continuity of spoken language (unlike Ancient Greek, it never stopped being spoken) and a large-ish community of speakers. If I want to speak Greek anywhere in the northeastern US, I basically only have the opportunity to do so once per year, while I can speak Latin several times per month outside school."
latin,38lop4,translatorstroubles,3,Fri Jun 5 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"When you take a Latin class, you do so to engage with literature. Speaking is the best way to do that, but communication is a means, not an end.   Absolutely. It just happens to be the most efficient and effective means to our particular end. Any benefit gained in terms of the ability to communicate with others (say from another country) is just icing on the cake.   Any idea what's being done with classical languages other than Latin and Greek? Do Coptic, Old Norse, Sanskrit etc. have the same pedagogical issues as Latin and Greek?   I know there's a budding movement for 'spoken' Sanskrit (as if a fairly large number of people in India hadn't been speaking it this whole time...) that a former professor wrote about in a departmental update from my Uni. awhile back. I'm not as familiar with the other languages, but from a friend who does a lot of work with Old English one of the issues is extant corpus size. From what he tells me the corpora in some of the older languages are just so small that it's actually less efficient to try and build them out to support spoken instruction in the first place.   I'd also imagine that things are worse for Greek--with Latin, there's a continuity of spoken language (unlike Ancient Greek, it never stopped being spoken) and a large-ish community of speakers.   Surprisingly if we're relatively flexible and permit Koine and Katharevousa to count as dialects similar to Classical Attic, there's a pretty well-attested tradition of spoken Greek by most of the population of that country up until the 1970s. They languages are obviously variants, but they're so structurally close that with training in Attic you can manage almost any Byzantine texts and, vocabulary issues aside, many Katharevousa texts as well. There's also a fairly well-attested tradition of spoken Ancient Greek in Europe during the Renaissance.  That said, in terms of spoken opportunities strictly in Attic, the numbers are growing slowly but they lag behind Latin. People are using it with CI and other modern pedagogies (Polis is perhaps the best example, though they focus on Koine) and having great success. The bigger issue there I think is just the fewer number of students and schools who deal with Greek in the first place."
latin,38lop4,translostation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"I know there's a budding movement for 'spoken' Sanskrit (as if a fairly large number of people in India hadn't been speaking it this whole time...)   Reciting isn't exactly the same as ""speaking."" Can Coptic be said to have been spoken this whole time?  Tell me more about this. I know there's been a spoken Sanscrit movement similar to ""latinitas uiua,"" and AIR does a daily newscast in the language (similar to Nuntii Latini). But were there communities of scholars speaking it extemporaneously even into the 20th Century?"
latin,38lop4,translatorstroubles,3,Fri Jun 5 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's been in continuous use. You can even find live ""sastric"" debates. You should bear in mind the Sanskrit corpus is huge. Astoundingly huge. They have the benefit of being able to reconstruct (more or less) full registers and several styles of speech. From what I understand, it's not an attempt at reconstruction or anything but a particular form of the language that's evolved for scholarly debate."
latin,38lop4,translostation,3,Fri Jun 5 08:02:32 2015 UTC,"For Old Norse the answer is kind of. For the last 90 years the standard text has basically been E.V. Gordon, which is a grammar and reader. It's quite normal for people to start translating texts almost immediately and pick up the grammar as they go. Outside of a handful of places, most people who learn Old Norse are grad students who often already have exposure to Latin, Old English, or German, and so are already pretty well aware of how case systems and verb conjugations work. In recent years there have been some new shifts to at least properly introduce the language, since there is no way you can expect undergrads to know any of the grammatical background.  However, one thing that Old Norse has strongly in its favor is that it is relatively close to modern Icelandic (much closer than Old or Middle English are to Modern English), and most people who are serious about Norse will end up spending a fair bit of time in Iceland."
latin,38lop4,translatorstroubles,2,Fri Jun 5 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I did a year of Hittite. Same problems, based on the same limitations. Strictly speaking, I don't think that scholars are confident in reconstructing an accurate spoken Latin or an accurate spoken Greek, and so the grammar as derived from our existing texts is taught, without making the kinds of assumptions you'd need to reconstruct the everyday communicative language. You're right that this is more a problem with Greek than Latin, and even more so with a language like Hittite."
latin,38lop4,translatorstroubles,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"But that's only an argument if your goal is reconstructing a spoken language for the purpose of having a spoken language for communication. That's not the purpose of spoken Latin or Greek (at least IMHO). The goal here is developing fluency in the literary language for reading ability, so it would make perfect sense to practice and learn that language. Speaking it has more to do with meeting the cognitive demands of learning a language in the way your brain is designed to process one than it does attempting to replicate a lost register."
latin,38lop4,translostation,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt.  I'm not arguing that we shouldn't attempt to speak in Latin or Ancient Greek, I'm just trying to explain the reason why we don't.  I mean, I've been in composition classes where I've gotten docked for writing a sentence that was too Ciceronian when we were told to ape Sallust.  The focus is so much on accuracy within specific bounds that there's just a strong knee-jerk reaction against teaching a spoken language whose relevant registers we can't definitely delineate and may not even possess."

All that I've said seems true given my experience in one of the top classics programs in the US, as an undergrad and briefly as a graduate student."
latin,38lop4,bitterlatinist,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"I got that. And as an undergrad in one of those programs I know the experience. I'm simply saying it's a crap argument and such highly intelligent people as the professors who run those programs should know better. They'd have failed me for that sort of logic on a paper, so I don't see why they're entitled to it. I personally believe that their reticence comes in part out of a deep insecurity that admitting just how wrong they are on this issue (and they are wrong - that fact is incontrovertible from an SLA perspective at this point) might call into question their own competencies with the languages that they supposedly teach. If that's the case, then I believe we just need to point out that the emperor has no clothes, collectively acknowledge the deep flaws with how we currently do things and our roles in perpetuating a sub-standard level of understanding of the languages, and then move to fix it. But that sort of change won't happen because academia moves at a glacial pace and Classics is the most recalcitrant field of the bunch."
latin,38lop4,Ireallydidnotdoit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Bear with me.  You remember that guy who discovered ""Troy"", Heinrich Schliemann?  He is famous for insisting that ancient Greek be spoken at his dinner table, renamed his servants after Homeric characters, and other obnoxious things.  Undoubtedly, his facility with Homeric Greek was amazing.  But how well you think you understand a languages use has real effects for how you judge it's literature and how you conceptualise the evidence that's put in front of you.  He can't have understood Homeric Greek as well as he thought he did, because it is impossible to (and it was never a communicative spoken language anyway).    Schliemann's most intimate understanding of Homeric Greek had a fundamental inaccuracy to it.  Sure, maybe he could think in ""it"" and speak ""it"" fluently, but ""it"" was largely a creation of his own mind.  Contrast that to the ability and approach of a Parry or Lord.  Who is more limited in their use of the language?  Parry and Lord.  Who is more fluent? Schliemann. But who has a more accurate perception of Homer?  Who gets us closer to understanding true things about antiquity? The Parrys and Lords of the world.  If we want an understanding of Classics premised on an intentionally false deep understanding of language, then emphasising spoken latin as if it were a living language is a great way to do it.  I think it's at least a legitimate counterpoint with considering."
latin,38lop4,erikepaios,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we have to be cautious of the other extreme, as well. If you're taking a Spanish class, you're taking it to communicate with Spanish speakers. Any literary goals are probably secondary to the primary objective of communication. When you take a Latin class, you do so to engage with literature.    My experience in Germany is almost the opposite: studying Latin at university is all about basic language competency: the ability to read Latin and to compose basic texts gets you almost all the way to your (equivalent of a master's) degree. Of course you read literary texts all the time - but mostly for language instruction, rarely to engage with them on a literary level.  Modern languages, on the other hand, take basic language competency for granted after the first or second year. Their students are required to understand and be able to apply literary theory and criticism.  Now, if you want to engage in current research within the field of Classics then that toolset (e.g. discourse analysis, structuralism & post-structuralism, postcolonial studies, symbolic interactionism, constructivism, ...) is something you will need to become familiar with (in order to play dress-up with dead horses as /u/translostation puts it; I won't deny that there pointless excesses but in general I don't share his pessimistic attitude) - but you have to do so on your own time because in the five years you studied for your degree you almost never looked beyond the individual sentence (that is to be grammatically dissected, translated, analyzed for stylistic devices, ...).  Considering the poor state of language competency (Latin at school is completely worthless, most freshmen - who presumably chose to major in Latin because they were good at it in secondary education - have a non-existent knowledge of the language) reducing the focus on it in favor of more literary theory is no option imo - although I know that other countries have done this, e.g. a friend from Italy told me that translation into Latin hasn't been required at his university for decades. I guess the only solution to close the gap between what our university education offers and what is required to participate in academic debate is to establish graduate schools for PhD students (which are still a rarity here in Germany; a PhD program here usually means to spend ~3 years researching & writing your thesis with no classes to attend)."

As for reading, I'd say that after the first year it was generally assumed we could/would read large amounts in the original and hence were constantly given large reading lists. Most of us even went and read beyond those since we were aiming for firsts. Reading fluency was kind of just...assumed.   I'm sorry to hear that about Germany, I would not have guessed it from any of the Germans I've met in the past five years."

And its a task that has mostly been completed for the classical authors.   Look up Irene de Jong's work for a great example of what philological work in the 21st century is about - that's the kind of commentaries our generation will be writing. Nobody needs the umpteenth rehash of the same work that already J.J. Scaliger did 450 years ago.  A typical reading list for a university class (to be read over the course of a semester) here is about 80 Oxford pages.  The translation text for this year's Abitur in my state were ~160 words from De Amicitia to be completed in 150 minutes with translations for 13 vocables supplied and dictionary use. So that's the level prospective Latin majors enter university with - typically after 7(!) years of Latin at the Gymnasium. As I said, Latin in secondary education is a complete waste of time."

As for ""reading classical texts as literary works"" I want to ask you why you think that reading for pleasure and a proper education are mutually exclusive? Do you think reading can only, or should only, occur in a classroom? That's stupid. Moreover, the point of an education is not to be self-indulgent - you are not owed four years of faffing about and then a good job afterwards! While the kids in medicine and physics are working their arses off learning material they often find uninteresting! It would be different if you meant place them in an ancient literary context...but given your dismissal of proper methodology I gather you mean some loose, wankery, humanistic thing. Which is fine, but do that on your time.   Look up Irene de Jong's work for a great example of what philological work in the 21st century is about - that's the kind of commentaries our generation will be writing. Nobody needs the umpteenth rehash of the same work that already J.J. Scaliger did 450 years ago.   Of course I'm familiar with that work, and it's kind of pointless. It starts from an unproven premise - that our sense of narrative is akin to their own - and proceeds to read the entire text through one theoretical lense. You know, happily ignoring not only classical para-literary material but near a century of fieldwork on oral literature more generally. Why on earth is that book a good thing?   But I worry that, yes, you're right. This is where the subject is heading in the 21st century.    A typical reading list for a university class here is about 80 Oxford pages. The translation text for this year's Abitur in my state were ~160 words from De Amicitia to be completed in 150 minutes with 13 vocables supplied and dictionary use. So that's the level prospective Latin majors enter university with - typically after 7(!) years of Latin at the Gymnasium. As I said, Latin in secondary education is a complete waste of time.   Yes, that's extremely dire. But as I said, from the Germans I've met you would never guess it. They all appear to be reasonably well read and to have a workable grasp of several areas of Classical Philology and often have interesting research interests. I'm not sure how to reconcile that with your description - perhaps they're largely autodidacts? I don't know."

XXXIII, serm. 1, where he is commenting on the story of David and Goliath as a figure of Christ and the devil:  In figura Christi David, sicut Golias in figura diaboli: et quod David prostravit Goliam, Christus est qui occidit diabolum. Quid est autem Christus qui diabolum occidit? Humilitas occidit superbiam. Cum ergo Christum nomino, fratres mei, maxime nobis humilitas commendatur. Viam enim nobis fecit per humilitatem: quia per superbiam recesseramus a Deo, redire ad eum nisi per humilitatem non poteramus, et quem nobis praeponeremus ad imitandum, non habebamus.  David is as a figure of Christ, just as Goliath is as a figure of the devil. And because David laid Goliath low, Christ is the one who has slain the devil. But what does it mean that Christ is the one who has slain the devil? Humility has slain pride. Since then I cite the example of Christ, my brothers, humility is commended to us par excellence. For he has made a path for us through humility. Since through pride we had retreated from God, we were not able to return to him except through humility, and we did not have anyone to hold before ourselves for our imitation.  This reveals that the actual translation should be in the perfect tense: ""Humility has slain pride."" Without the context, the verb occidit is ambiguous."

latin,38ae93,Sheikh_Kristophe,2,Wed Jun 3 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"Gross. Latin is beautiful, but let's look at why things are better now:   Educational materials were not universally accessible, as they are now, the barrier to entry being, as it were, Latin. This lack of access led to the supreme rule of the Church and the Elite.  Humanity was no better then than now. There were crusades, witch hunts, inquisitions, wars, tyranny, aristocracy, rampant ignorance, etc. Sure, reading Epistulae morales ad Lucilium in the original Latin is intellectually stimulating, but not for the reason this treatise implies: It's in another language, quite different from our own. It's basically the equivalent of reading At-Tabari's histories or Ibn Sina's works in the original Arabic, or ancient Persian poetry, or the Illiad in Greek, or the Talmud in Hebrew....  There are very few works that are only in Latin (and it's probably due to their relatively low value), so not much is inaccessible to the non-Latin speaker. The inconsistencies in non-Latin languages have vanished. Technical vocab is very precise (often mutually intelligible with other languages anyways), and there is no ambiguity in Academia (maybe at his time, but certainly not now), so I reject the idea that ignorance of Latin is like being in a fine country on a misty day.   Yes, other languages, dead as well, should be taught more, and are without a doubt a fine intellectual exercise, and a fun hobby for some. However, in these days of global connectivity and a huge base of human knowledge that post-dates the academic use of Latin, learning a dead language is just an intellectual, literary, and historical exercise, whereas learning a living one (French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Farsi, Mandarin, Cantonese, Russian) is not just an intellectual, literary, and historical exercise, bur goes beyond that to be a technical, technological, global exercise.   That being said, I still love Latin, and get great pleasure in learning it.  Edit: If you still think Schopenhaur's judgment is unbiased and solid, read this doozy : ""Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted"" or ""woman is by nature meant to obey."""

However, here's the passage in Vox Latina about igitur's connection to agitur:   We know from the grammarians that certain conjunctions were unaccented, e.g. at, et, sed, igitur (the last in fact probably arose by vowel weakening from agitur in expressions such as quίd agitur)"

Instead: ""The father spoke with such a serious expression that Cornelia wondered what had happened.""

Instead: ""Cornelia wrote to Flavia: ""I was so happy that I was scarcely able to speak."""" I was confused because ""er"" isn't a latin word, is that a typo? The translation I'm giving you is what I deduce that it's supposed to be, because of sequence of tenses, and ""potuerim"" is a perfect subjunctive.   Let me know if you have any questions!! :)"
latin,38avr4,DeprecatoryElitist,2,Wed Jun 3 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"So your biggest problem seems to be that you're listening to your teacher too much. Your teacher has probably told you that word order doesn't matter in Latin--that's completely false. Here, you need to pay attention to word order more closely.  In Latin, conjunctions are lines that, 95% of the time, cannot be crossed. So, when you have a conjunction, everything before it stays before it, everything after stays after. (this is a bit of an oversimplification, but it works well here) ut is a subordinating conjunction, so you need a subordinate clause. Most of the time that clause will start with ut and end in a subjunctive verb. So, in these result clauses, everything between ut and the end of the clause is part of the result clause, and everything outside it is part of the main clause. You've been jumbling things up, when really, you should be reading left to right, just like you do in English.  So, let's break it down into its constituent elements. When one element is divided, I label it with A and B:  Pater tam gravī vultū locūtus est ut Cornēlia mīrārētur quid accidisset.  1A: Pater (subject)  2: Tam gravi voltu (ablative phrase describing the verb)  1B: locutus est (verb)  3: ut Cornelia miraretur (result clause with conjunction, subject, and verb)  4: quid accidisset: indirect question because of miraretur."

latin,382zow,Glofkill,7,Mon Jun 1 14:08:30 2015 UTC,"Although you won't see this word in literature from the Republican period (and rarely thereafter), it has some interesting etymology behind it.  One of the more frequent affixes that attaches to verbs in Latin to derive other verbs is the ""frequentative"" morpheme -ta-, placed on the end of the verb stem and transforming the verb into a first conjugation.  It marks actions that are done with some element of repetition or intensity or freneticness.  Here are a few examples:   canere (sing, play an instrument) > cantare (chant, sing, perform) iacere (toss, throw, cast) > iactare (hurl, scatter, disturb) rapio -ere (snatch, seize, plunder) > raptare (seize and carry off, drag off, plunder)   Here, we see the ending applied to salto -are, which means ""to dance,"" giving us an idea of enthusiastic or wild dancing.  The irony, of course, being that saltare already has -ta- in it.  (It probably used to have a short i in it, salitare, that wore off over time.)  The moral of today's story: ""Dancing,"" to the Romans, was apparently originally thought of as frenetically or repeatedly jumping about (salire).  Moderately amusing inflected forms:   saltitate! saltitemus saltitabatis"

I feel like writing your teacher a sternly worded letter.  On scary law-firm letterhead.   Could I ask you folks for a study guide?   Latin grammars like Bennett's or Allen and Greenough will have declension charts for the pronouns if you know where to look.  I'd suggest copying them out onto flashcards and coming up with little rhythmic chants to drill them in your head.  The pronoun declensions are weirdly second nature to me now, but I can still flash back to high school and remember exactly how I used to rhythmically chant ego mei mihi me me tu tui tibi te te to myself to make the forms stick in my head.  It may also help to look for similarities between the forms and think of little families of related declensions.  I mean, me te and se all look a lot alike, no?

Some phrase they want to have someone say in their ""novel"", since the one thing that can turn the tide from a novel being unpublishable to being a great hit is that someone inside it speaks a cool language.

It's such a tiny favor to do for another person.   Because if it takes you a few minutes the translation is likely to be shit. Tattoo requests are annoying because they require an extreme amount of effort compared to their length and shift an imo unfair burden of responsibility to the (volunteer) translator.  Take this thread from the front page. OP wants ""Go see the world"" or ""See the World"" translated for a tattoo. Suggestions are ""specta mundum"" and ""vide mundum"".  None of which I would want to have engraved on my skin - these are great examples for the type of low effort translations I'm talking about. People just string some Latin words together in a grammatically more or less correct way without any regard for meaning or beauty. For a permanent tattoo that's simply not good enough.   With basically any tattoo request you need to do a thorough semantic analysis of the English phrase first. /u/MagisterTJL comes closest in this thread with    Here, I think spectare may be better, because there's more of a sense of agency   Of course I disagree completely with his conclusion that spectare is a good choice but he has a point about agency. ""See the world"" does not mean ""Watch the world"" (as you might watch a play, a flower, ...), it means ""Leave your comfort zone! Travel the world! See its wonders! Get to know different cultures! Become a cosmopolitan!"" and all that condensed into three words. Translating it into Latin is a tall order (on the spot I couldn't adequately translate the phrase into my native language ffs) and ""specta mundum"" does not do.  So now you would have to scour Latin literature for places where this sentiment is expressed: letters, poetry, novels - the corpus is vast but somewhere there probably is a solution.  If after having spent many hours (but, hey, you're talking about something that will stay with its bearer for the rest of his life - what is a few hours in comparison to a botched job), you still come up empty, you have to start thinking yourself. So you go search dictionaries, collections of synonyms, phraseologies. Is ""mundus"" commonly used in this 'exotic' sense? If not what is? What words could express seeing here (e.g., prima facie, visere seems like a much stronger candidate than spectare)? Should we even think along the lines of ""seeing"" in Latin? Is it better to translate the ""Go"" or not? If yes, as actual ""go"" + supine or as something like ""age""? (back to dissecting the English semantics), ... We're now in uncharted waters, so we have to be extra careful, backing up every decision with literature research, and there's a high chance that whatever solution we'll eventually come up with after having invested so much time, would still sound ridiculous to Roman ears.   That's why I hate tattoo translation requests. Either you do a poor job (which is really not an option given the stakes) or you put in half a day of research (often only to realize that you just can't translate the requested phrase) or you don't touch them with a 10 foot pole. On a forum run by volunteers they seem grossly unfair to me."
latin,382e1s,amemut,2,Tue Jun 2 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"Before I say anything else, I want to say that I completely recognize your argument and agree with everything you've said in your reply. We both seem to appreciate that the stakes are terribly high with tattoo requests, because it is something that the person will keep for life. I also agree that any response should include at least some literature research to investigate how a native Latin speaker might have actually said the phrase. I included this sort of work in my timeframe of ""a few minutes,"" but I was speaking a little figuratively. In the way I meant it, ""a few minutes"" could mean up to a few hours of work. It takes me ""a few minutes"" to write a reply like this one, and it has already taken me about ten minutes to read your comment and write this much in response.  I also agree that ""vide mundum"" is a terrible translation of ""see the world."" Some of the first thoughts I had on this matter were that orbis terrarum better captures the sense of 'world' in this phrase, and that a Latin word meaning 'travel broadly' would be a better translation of the English word 'see' in this context. I would have to spend some time on Perseus looking for examples before I offered anything at all. Once I did come up with what I considered to be an appropriate translation, I would offer both the literal: ""videte orbem terrarum""/""videte mundum"" with some caveats about their accuracy in terms of meaning, along with a looser but more accurate translation based on a bit of text searching. (Out of curiosity, what is your native language? I'd like to see if I can come up with something there, and then you would be in a good position to critique it.)  In general, I don't like tattoos. In the U.S. at least, they've become such overt marks of class that I would immediately advise anyone against having a visible tattoo. The harsh reality is, they can negatively affect a person's social standing and future career prospects. This is precisely why I would recommend that anyone committed to their (slightly foolish) decision to get a tattoo in a language they don't speak consult with as many knowledgable people as possible before engraving it into themselves. In this regard, I see posting something on Reddit as the lesser of two evils, the greater evil being that they try to do it all by themselves and producing something patently absurd.  So, it seems to me, we both appreciate the difficult nature of tattoo requests, but have different ideas about the best way to deal with them. Perhaps then this is something that should be dealt with at the subreddit level, such as putting a notice in the sidebar with a warning to anyone who would ask for a tattoo translation that they might not get what they bargained for, and that they should take the well-intentioned efforts of anyone trying to help with a grain of salt. My initial solution was simply to say: ""Send it to me and let me do it, because I know I'll do it right,"" but this could backfire pretty easily. Not only do I make mistakes in translations all the time, but I wouldn't want to be overwhelmed with more requests than I could attend to properly. That said, I think banning tattoo requests outright is not a great solution either. The fact is, lacking any place to turn for advice, people will simply pull out a dictionary and create something awful.  Also, I personally feel that being an academic who has had the good fortune to spend huge amounts of my time learning things I enjoy rather than having to work for my bread obligates me to use my knowledge to help people whenever the opportunity arises. I think the same probably applies to anyone who has the resources needed to spend time browsing /r/latin."

latin,37xekj,chelseap2014,1 point,Sun May 31 06:06:31 2015 UTC,My Latin teacher wrote this on my last test in his class. Such a great quote for the work we put in all four years :)

latin,37xekj,MagisterTJL,1 point,Sun May 31 11:05:00 2015 UTC,"I always found it funny how this has been used. In the Aeneid, the point is that even though they've suffered a lot, things could get so much worse."
latin,37xekj,bitterlatinist,4,Sun May 31 15:19:18 2015 UTC,"Where do you get this from?  On the level of the story Aeneas is mentally preparing his crew for all that they still have to go through (""Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis""; ""secundis"" definitely = ""sequentibus"", cf. verse 156 for this usage; people so often seem to misread this as ""save yourself for better times""), precluding any thoughts of staying at this shore. He does so by dangling the limited duration of the journey (""dabit deus his quoque finem""), the dangers already overcome (Vos et Scyllaeam rabiem penitusque sonantis // accestis scopulos, vos et Cyclopea saxa // experti""), the longed for destination (""tendimus in Latium; sedes ubi fata quietas // ostendunt; illic fas regna resurgere Troiae"") and the idea that in the end it all will have been worth it, that one day they might in fact think back gladly on what they had to go through (Vergil certainly is aware of how memories become rosier over time), in front of his men.  On a different level we, the readers, prove by reading the Aeneid and thus remembering all the troubles Aeneas undertook that his statement has indeed come true. Olim can very well reach far beyond the horizon of Aeneas into the time of Vergil and his readers. In fact, if we are looking for the point of this statement this is what I would concentrate on. It makes us readers acutely aware of the distance between ourselves and Aeneas: How unlikely it must seem to him ("" ... curisque ingentibus aeger // spem vultu simulat ..."") that his words would indeed come true, that one day there would be Trojans/Romans to remember this all! And how far removed are we who cannot help but see everything from the end (as Vergil makes abundantly clear in the first lines of his work) from his thoughts and feelings! For us these unspeakable experiences have to stay, no matter how skillfully described by the poet, a story to be fondly remembered. Making us aware of that distance is all Vergil can do and imo a stroke of genius. I can't read the line without having shivers run down my spine."
latin,37xekj,MagisterTJL,1 point,Sun May 31 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis, thanks.  I think we're pretty much on the same page--I wrote rather hastily and groggily. My main issue is that in context, Aeneas is talking about the struggles his men have endured, and saying that it may be pleasing to remember those struggles someday, but as it's too commonly used, it has become a sort of yearbook quote-type thing, looking back on happy memories."

Here, I think spectare may be better, because there's more of a sense of agency--it's used for seeing a play performed.  Just a note, videte is plural, meaning it's addressed to multiple people. If you're addressing one person, it would be vide. For specta, if you're addressing multiple people, it's spectate. And note too that Latin pronounces all vowels."

latin,37ui8f,correon,1 point,Sun May 31 06:16:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I had no idea the English word ""emerald"" was directly descended from it, thanks! For the record Wikitionary usually has good etymologies for languages other than English. In this case it agrees. Funnily enough if you go to the Greek entry, it lists a whole bunch of cognates in other languages as descendants, even ones that are inherited through other languages (such as all the Latin loans in Eastern Europe: ""szmaragd"" in Polish, ""smaragd"" in Hungarian). Weirdly, Arabic and Hebrew are listed as loans. The Hebrew one really is an obvious loan because it contains an epenthetic softening vowel at the beginning (""izmaragd"" rather than ""zmaragd"", since the syllable onset ""zm"" is hard to pronounce for Hebrew speakers), and I guess the Arabic must be one too. This points to a non-Semitic root for the word, possibly from the pre-Greek substrate."

I have doubts about the efficacy of self-study for beginning students (so many posts asking about it or declaring they started with it, so few people with a good grasp of the language who haven't received formal education), so my advice is to enroll into any kind of Latin class or to find a private tutor for two or three hours each week. I'd prefer studying under some Wheelock-wielding grammar nazi and then having to relearn everything using the Ørberg books a few years down the line to undirected self-study.  If you have 5,000 € to spare enroll in the Vivarium Novum Summer Courses, they'll bring you from nothing to reading real authors (actually reading, not translating) in 8 weeks.

So I don't think they're being hurt by bad Latin tattoos--they're getting a tattoo that they think sounds cool, even if it doesn't mean what they think it does, and while we're getting laughs out of them, most of the general public has no clue it's hilariously bad, unless you get one of the truly awful examples that throw in random English words like ""the"" or ""of."""

latin,37la1a,ItsComrade,5,Sun May 31 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"That's not how Google Translate works. They don't program in syntax/grammar rules. The program compares texts in English and Latin using probability to determine what the sentence means. It looks for as many examples of puellae as it can and then determines which meaning is most likely based on its English translation. The problem is there isn't a large enough corpus of parallel texts for the software to work accurately. If all 7,000 /r/Latin users wrote a 300 word paragraph on vicipaedia, Latin on Google Translate would be much better.  Google translate correctly translates both ""puella pilam iacit"" and ""pilam puella iacit"" and ""iacit puella pilam"" BUT not ""iacit pilam puella"". Meaning it doesn't actually look at the word endings, it doesn't ""understand"", it's just that last phrase is unusual and Google Translate thinks that it means ""He throws the ball, girl."""
latin,37la1a,dmstewar2,3,Thu May 28 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is surely that a) the Latin corpus deals with many pre-modern affairs and not with many modern ones and that b) the English translations of parts of this corpus available to Google are frequently in non-colloquial or somewhat archaic style both because of when they were done (e.g., public domain translations of classical works) and because of the habit of using a classicized register for translations of classical works.

Google Translate can train on languages like English and French from gajillions of very accurate bilingual documents: every Canadian public document, every UN public document, and a lot of public domain literature translated to and from both languages.  And it still makes tons of dumb mistakes.  The Lain corpus is laughably small by comparison, and it doesn't come close to covering the same topics and abstract nonsense that everyone asks it to translate.  How can you blame it for sucking?

latin,37nygr,TheFireFly5000,4,Fri May 29 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"You mention in a comment that choosing the right cases and translating from English into Latin is giving you problems.  Both are a sign that, even if you have the vocabulary down, you haven't really got a solid grip on Latin grammar.  I always had the opposite problem, but I'll try to help.  The kind of thing that becomes easier and more natural with practice.  And grammar lends itself better to teaching and explanation better than vocabulary does, which takes a lot more of either memorization and contextual learning.  So count yourself lucky.  For good explanations of grammar, I'd suggest checking out LatinTutorial's YouTube channel.  He has an Ecce Romani playlist that (I think) tracks the chapters of your textbook.  And he's pretty good at explaining the traditional grammar explanations.  Another wonderful resource are Latin grammars (like Bennett's, in which you can look up a case to see all the ways it's used.  These are probably a little above your pay grade right now, but it may help give you context or give you the broader perspective that makes things fit together better.  Any particular grammatical constructions or cases that are giving you trouble?"

latin,37nt3d,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,2,Fri May 29 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"See my posts in reply to another comment here for my suggestions in terms of preparing your Latin. The biggest boon you can do for yourself is to work on developing your sight-reading skills, and that happens most easily via extensive reading of texts that you find comprehensible. Try to avoid translating as much as possible as you do this. If you find yourself having to resort to translating or looking up lots of words (i.e. more than ~5-10 per page) to understand the meaning, the text is likely a bit too difficult for you to continue. You could also use the Tar Heel Readers if you find that the texts I linked you to are too challenging at first. Really, the more comprehensible Latin you can get under your belt, the better off you'll be. Don't waste your time trying to sight-translate original authors - you should work on that with your teacher during the year, and you'll be sacrificing the opportunity to develop your language skills more quickly on a wider variety of fronts if you do so.  In terms of the AP texts themselves, I always recommend that students read as much of them (i.e. all!) in translation as they possibly can, as well as the author's other works if they can stomach them. The ability to reference parts of the text outside of the corpus during the essay portion can never hurt you. I don't have a particular translation for Caesar (whatever is fine), but for Vergil there's no substitute for Fred Ahl's translation of the Aeneid. It is not only the best all-around English version of the text, but it's got a really great introduction and accompanying commentary that will help you get a bigger picture of the poem in its cultural context. Don't skip out on reading those parts!"
latin,37nt3d,translostation,2,Fri May 29 01:02:19 2015 UTC,Congrats on getting a job as a Latin teacher! When did that happen?

I think it's mostly the flair that makes it more noticeable. That said, I accepted a fellowship offer to do my MA at Kentucky this spring, so it's a short trip before another long hiatus from the (high school) classroom."
latin,37ohj5,zackroot,3,Fri May 29 03:45:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'm curious to see some other answers, myself.  The best sources I can think of for actual lower-class Latin are graffiti/epigraphy.  And as for how actual upper-class people talked to each other, the closest thing that comes to mind is Cicero's letters...  Hopefully some of the actual academics that lurk around here might be able to point you to better, if more esoteric, sources."
latin,37ohj5,correon,2,Fri May 29 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"Satyricon by Petronius. The textbook version is really easy to read and has a lot of help with the vocab.  Also Eutropius has a very simple style, it was used as a school textbook for a long time.  You'll learn slang for ""drunk, shit, homosex"" etc."
latin,37ohj5,dmstewar2,2,Fri May 29 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"The Saturnalia by Macrobius is fragmentary and not much in the way of commentary exists, but it has quite a few good jokes in it that I can only assume were the sorts of things actual Romans were telling each other. As correon has suggested, Cicero's letters are also good, but I'd be cautious of them, as anything he kept for publication is likely edited and was already literary anyway.  Petronius's Satyricon is also quite good."

Also get PDFs of things like Cornelia, Carolus et Maria, and especially Pons Tironum and read through them. What you want to do is extensive reading (lots of content at a level that you find comprehensible - 95% known vocab/grammar) to solidify your understanding of the language. You don't want to do much intensive (""close"") reading - that doesn't do much for building your facility in the language quickly."

You're totally right about the extensive versus intensive reading, and when I think about it all I've really done by following the coursework so far is a minimum of intensive reading. I hadn't really thought about the difference before.    That link looks great! It'll be a lot of work, sure, but I'm willing to work for learning Latin -- I just didn't know where to start before.

Hell, start reading the Satyricon.  If you're looking for something easy, start reading Vergil. Get Pharr's edition, it contains the first six books of the Aeneid with vocabulary immediately under the text.  You could also try GeoffreySteadman.com, which has various commentaries with facing vocab and commentary.  There's nothing like reading Latin for learning to read Latin.  Bottom line, jump into real texts as soon as you can.  edit: If you want to be comfortable reading the Satyricon, start reading it now.  It's unfortunate, but because what survives of Classical literature is spotty, texts often have unique feels to them, and even sometimes unique grammatical usages. If you really want to get better at grammar, focus on reading prose, but the most important thing is to read something that you're motivated to read every day.  If you don't want to waste your classical education, you have to be motivated, which means reading material that you like.  Start reading things you like now, and read what you like forever."
latin,37lien,translatorstroubles,1 point,Thu May 28 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the advice. It's funny you recommend the Aeneid -- here, that's a third year text. I'll definitely grab that edition, and start working my way through the Satyricon now. You're right, the best way to do this is to, well, DO it. After the last semester I lost my motivation, intimidated by the move toward actual texts and not a textbook, and that's totally on me. I'll have a Latin-full summer and get ready! Thanks again."
latin,37lien,bitterlatinist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Aeneid isn't hard at all.  You'll love it.  Plus, I find it easier to be motivated when I can set small edible goals.  I always found that ""40 lines of the Aeneid"" was a psychologically easier goal than ""4 sections of [insert prose text]"", given that section lengths aren't standard and whatnot.  It's a bit self-serving, since I'm working on Martial right now, but reading an epigram or short lyric poem a day, come hell or high water, might help you too.  Catullus, Tibullus, Horace, etc., they all have lovely pungent poems that won't take you long to read."

latin,37jpu5,Sochamelet,1 point,Thu May 28 13:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It's funny you should say that. I once heard that French as a language is actually a bit closer to classical Latin than for instance Italian or Romanian, as in what's now France it was mainly the elite who spoke Latin, and they stuck to classical Latin a lot more. This doesn't seem to go well with what you said. Would you happen to know if the two can be reconciled?"
latin,37jpu5,Ireallydidnotdoit,3,Thu May 28 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not MagisterTJL but, in short, not really. French has some pretty significant phonological and morphosyntactical differences. Also that's not really how good philologists think. Often when people discuss distance from Latin they tend to cite Mario Pei's (? or some other such non Classicists) study which is one of vocabulary.  You should see the problem with this, it's not just dependent on what corpus you've selected but tells you nothing. Romanian, for example, looked a hell of a lot less like a Romance language and more like a Slavic one when it was first attested. Registers shift and change as much for social and political reasons as anything else. When we, as Classicists, throw out terms like conservatism it should always be qualified by what aspect of a language we're talking about and at what stage."

If someone pays someone else a compliment, you might politely say he did it pro sua benignitate (out of his kindness). If he gives a gift, perhaps he did it suo beneficio. Other kinds of favors could easily be described as being done gratia alicuius  (by the favor of someone). I personally don't recall seeing ex gratia used by classical authors much, if at all."

latin,37dxvm,barrabaird,2,Tue May 26 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"I feel you, brother.  I did a B.A. in Classics, got into the workforce, got accepted into an M.A. program 3 years later, decided that there was no future in academia for me, and left.  But I still loved the Classics, and realised I couldn't keep up with it while working in the U.S. So I left, now live and work overseas, and have plenty of time to read / write commentaries, etc.  My advice:  First thing, you have to claim Latin as a part of your identity.  You are able to read and understand the literature and culture of a group of people that lived 2000 years ago.  A group of people that also helped give birth to the modern world.  That's special and worth preserving.  It's nobler than learning Chinese, Spanish, or some other practical language.  Whether that statement is objectively true or not is unimportant; if you don't believe that, you'll be unmotivated.  Understand how special and how rare this ability is.  Losing it would be a personal catastrophe for you, and catastrophe generally for all the people who can benefit from your ability. It's not popular to say, but knowledge of the Roman world is special.  Treat it like the gem that it is.  Understand that you will never be recognised for any contribution that you make to the field.  But that doesn't matter.  You are part of a very tiny part of western humanity that is able to preserve the past for the future.  It is a tremendous gift.  Second, start writing commentaries to capitalise on this gift.  The best thing I ever did was to start writing commentaries on Martial.  I'd never read him, but I liked him by reputation, and wanted to learn more about him. I started doing commentaries as best I could, starting with book 1 of the epigrams.  I'm at epigram 54, and should be done with the first book of epigrams in about 4 months.  Having to explain every grammatical interpretation to readers that are both critical and dependent on you i hugely important.  Having enough knowledge to commentate intelligently means you have to dig into the secondary lit, which means you'll grow your conceptual knowledge of a certain area at the same time as you cement your grammatical knowledge.  If you pick a neglected text to commentate, you'll actually be making a concrete contribution to the future of classical studies by enabling intermediate/beginner students to be read more texts more easily.  That is way more satisfying than just doing exercises for your own edification.  Third, find something you love reading about.  If you love Caesar, read and commentate on Caesar.  If you love Vergil, read and commentate on Vergil.   Goodluck, and don't choose Martial Book 1, he's already taken! ;-)"

Do the workbooks if you can too. That process alone should develop and cement your Latin quite nicely. When you finish all that, just read whatever you'd like. You'll be ready for it."
latin,37dxvm,translostation,1 point,Wed May 27 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"You will almost certainly fail to keep up on Latin. Pretty much everybody had some hobby or interest he/she intended to keep up with during college or after entering the workforce and most people only seem to come back to it once the midlife crisis or retirement hits. You will be swamped with work, Latin will be one of the first things to drop by the wayside and once you've been out of it for a few weeks getting back in will be hard and feel unrewarding.  These are the strategies I recommend:   You need social support. If your hobby was playing an instrument you should play in a band or orchestra to force yourself to stay engaged with it. With Latin things are more difficult. If your university permits, attend one Latin class each term (even if you can't earn any credits there). Attend a conventiculum each year. Look for Latin clubs and meetups in and outside the university. You need a regular schedule. If you want to progress you'll have to engage with Latin regularly, ideally several times a week. How much time you spend on Latin each session is not all that relevant. 20 minutes every day is far more valuable than 4 hours once a week (something that students generally refuse to understand).  Turn Latin into an instrument of procrastination. How can you justify reading Latin texts when you have actually important exams to study for? trust me, you'll find a way. Latin can be a great way of making you appear busy to yourself while avoiding any actual work. This is probably your best shot at keeping your interest for Latin alive.   edit: Read whatever you feel like reading. Keeping your motivation alive is far more important than searching for the didactically optimal approach."
latin,37dxvm,bitterlatinist,1 point,Wed May 27 04:50:07 2015 UTC,"In the 60s, Clément Desessard published through Assimil an a method called ""Sine molestia/sans peine"", and was part of the the ""Living Latin"" movement and takes an immersion approach.   If you've never used an Assimil product, they generally work like this:   one lesson a day, which consists of text in the target language on the left, and translation on the right (in this case in French or Italian) every seventh lesson is a review/explanation of the grammar you've encountered. all the texts in the target language are recorded by native speakers (in this case, a francophone classical Latin pronounciation)   What I love about this is just listening to the lessons, which are usually some humorous dialogue between two or more people. The lessons include monsterous amounts of neologisms pertaining to things like writing checks, trains, cars, etc.  Assimil produced a new Latin course by Ducos-Phillipi...not quite the same magic, for me at least.  Assimil did, however, re-release the recordings for the Desessard course using Italian speakers, so classical Latin pronounciation with an Italian accent, but the quality is much better.   So -- if you read French or Italian, and can find a copy of the book, and the new recordings, its a lovely way to spend your commute.  I can't find the new Desessard on Assimil's site, but here's the Italian version on Amazon.  You could also email Assimil about the Desessard course if it sounds interesting to you and aren't having luck finding it otherwise.  I'd love to find other recordings of dialogues like this in Latin -- it really engages the brain differently than simply hearing a single speaker perform recitation...  Another idea might be to work through a Latin composition text..."

latin,37ditz,redstone1337,3,Tue May 26 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"Your reasoning with regard to the church fathers is off - of course the Latin spoken in the streets was well on its way towards Romance by the time (vowel changes having taken place, on-going degeneration of the case system) but the literary language was still essentially the same as in Cicero's times. The generally spoken (""vulgar"") and the written language diverged at some point (obviously there had always been differences in register, but e.g. the loss of cases goes beyond that) but the spoken language never affected the written language very much (until eventually it itself became written language that coexisted with Latin, e.g. in the Old French portions of the Oaths of Strasbourg). In the 4th - 6th century you'll find some new Christian vocabulary, some periphrastic verb forms, and rarely a case being wrongly used or the wrong gender being attributed to a noun - none of which puts your Spanish skills to good use. To see the kind of written Latin that structurally looks like Romance written with Latin vocabulary and inflections (using unus/ille as articles, using constructions with ""de"" for genitives, and so on) you pretty much have to deliberately seek out written Latin at its worst (in the 8th or 9th century).  Caesar is in my opinion of limited value. He set out with a very special program that may have helped to shape Latin at a critical phase of its development but which after him nobody really seems to have followed. Part of this program is an extremely restricted use of vocabulary which supposedly makes him ""easy"" - but due to his idiosyncrasy he's just about the worst preparation for any other author you could possibly imagine (I admit to some hyperbole but I truly believe that Caesar has on the one hand no place in high-school Latin but would on the other hand deserve to be appreciated more in university classes).  My recommendation to you is Phaedrus' Latin retelling of Aesop's fables. Short self-contained stories, an easy meter (senarius), nothing crazy in terms of syntax, good vocabulary, and of high cultural value (Aesop's fables are one of the few pieces of culture we really share with the ancients). Imo the ideal starting point for a journey that will lead you to Ovid, Vergil and beyond."

Pretty Close.

Noctis should be in the nominative plural to go with daemons, which would make it noctes (as a noun it goes like dux, ducis). Although, and take this with a pinch of salt as I'm not 100% sure, you could use the ablative plural form which would be noctibus to form an ablative of description construction. (Basically Latin can use the ablative case sometimes to describe a feature of a subject.) However, since it's actually Night Demons rather than Demons of the Night or similar I'd be inclined to stick with the former, so Noctes Daemons it is.  Except Daemons should be Daemones since it's Nominative plural and the same declension as nox; which would make Noctes Daemones.  Then you have ex abruptis caelum. I think you've correctly used the ablative of description here, in which case ex is superfluous to the translation - it's already conveyed in the abruptis caelum. However caelum is in the wrong case and needs to be caelis (ablative form again).   This leaves you with Noctes Daemones Abruptis Caelis. I should note that Abruptis Caelis is plural - which would mean broken skies. If you desperately want it to be broken sky then abruptis needs to go to be a singular ablative past participle along with caelis being ablative singular too, which would be abrupto caelo.   Finally leaving you with Noctes Daemones Abrupto Caelo.  I'm happy to be corrected by anyone who can spot mistakes but this is accurate to my mind (still not sure about noctes as stated above). It's a bit of a mouthful as a group name though."

Nevertheless, I spotted some mistakes: I'm afraid you can't simply put a noun in front of another noun to describe it in Latin as you can in English. Noctes daemones could only be interpreted as 'nights are demons', with sunt being omitted, or something like that. Also, while you can use an ablative to describe a noun, it is specifically used for properties, not things that are associated with the noun in general. My grammar book has the example vir magna eloquentia: 'a man of great eloquence'. I hope you can see that his shade of meaning is noticeably different from something like 'of the shattered sky', or 'of the night'.  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them."

I don't know where you're from but in the UK one can learn Latin from 13 up until 18 without ever having a mandatory examination on composition. It makes things easier but consequently my understanding of conjugations and declensions isn't superb; I know from experience that caelum is accusative but I'd have to think for a bit if you asked me which declension it is.  Did you study Latin/Classics at university?   Do you have any pieces of advice regarding job prospects after uni or even key texts for undergraduate level?

However, I would recommend learning things like your declensions and conjugations by heart, unless you have an intuitive feel for them, of course, as native speakers would, but I doubt many people have such a feel for Latin.

Our first year was mostly intensive crash courses for both Latin and Greek, going through all the grammar and reading a lot of texts. After that, I really noticed the difference. Now, I don't know if it's similar in the UK, but it's all I know, I'm afraid.  Concerning jobs, I'm not sure. In the Netherlands it's pretty much expected you become a classics teacher, or perhaps you're one of the lucky few who goes on to do research. Those two things are currently what I'm looking at myself, but I do know of classicists who went on to work in museums. That is also perhaps unsurprising, although I understand there aren't very many. Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much: last week I saw a presentation of someone who did a PhD in classics and is now a tax consultant, so strange things can happen. Good luck in any case, and enjoy it. It's a beautiful field."

As far as my experience goes Greek does have a more complex morphology but its syntax is more intuitive than that of Latin and having articles really makes life easier. By not having an aorist and a full set of participles the Latin system of tenses is arguably more difficult than the Greek one (due to the lack of participles you often end up with nonsense like ""aetate ineunte"" but ""aetate inita"" in Latin; reading poetry it feels like you have to ignore either tense or voice of the participle half of the time).  Maybe it's a German thing (we have a stronger tradition of philhellenism than the English world; Ancient Greek represents progress, the Enlightenment and modern philology, whereas Latin has been associated with subjection to authoritarian structures in church & state, a normative rather than descriptive approach to the language and tedious classroom drills) but in conversations over a glass of wine its nearly always the Latinist who is on the defensive and has to prove that the Latin language has at least some beauty to it, that Latin literature is more than just imitation of Greek models, ... Greek generally seems to be considered the more rewarding language to study.  tl;dr Don't let people here scare you about Greek."

I do believe that almost anyone can do it, however, certainly in the UK, many universities run courses lasting only a year that bring people from nothing at all to A- level (pre uni) standard The only thing I can say almost for certain is that Greek is the significantly harder of the duo, being far more idiomatic and irregular, and that learning both at the same time is not something to be undertaken lightly"

latin,36r78q,kingjingaling1,-3,Thu May 21 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how easily Europeans and Americans appropriate even the most remote stone piles as part of their own history - and therefore as their property that needs to be defended from the unwashed locals. What a pity that we weren't able to carry off an entire city to the British Museum!    If I was bored I'd take a look at how the actions of ISIS are viewed through a lens provided by traditional depictions of the 410 sack of Rome. Instead of e.g. drawing comparisons to the iconoclasm and religious wars of the 16th century, everybody has suddenly started to talk about barbarians. This and this seems to form the template with which we interpret the actions of ISIS. It's also remarkable how a former commander of NATO forces in Europe invokes the specter of another sack of Rome in this article to push for completely unrelated objectives (a peacekeeping mission in Lybia, increased monitoring of the Mediterranean)."

latin,36r78q,GuyofMshire,-2,Fri May 22 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'd happily blow up the entire place if doing so could save one life. It's a bunch of rocks we're talking about and ancient ruins have been used as quarries and worse for hundreds of years. A ""tragedy for all of humanity""? It's a tragedy for the few dozen archaeologists who were hoping to stake their careers on future excavations in the area.   Also iconoclasm is hardly a foreign concept to us but I have never heard anyone refer to the 8th/9th century iconoclasts in the East or the iconoclastic Protestants of the 16th century as ""barbarians"". Even if we ultimately haven't come to share it, the basic proposition should be relatable to anyone brought up in a Christian context.  From my point of view nothing in the way people talk about ISIS makes sense. Somehow this organization seems to cause generally reasonable people's minds to short-circuit in strange ways. Not even the Khmer Rouge gets talked about with anywhere close to the same amount of vitriol as is ISIS. How come this is such a personal matter to people who live thousands of miles away? The organization is being demonized (especially Graeme Wood's Atlantic article did not only get blown completely out of proportion on reddit but also seems to achieve the direct opposite of its stated goals), ISIS-affiliated fighters are routinely being dehumanized in discussions here (frequently referred to as ""animals"", highly upvoted suggestions to slaughter them indiscriminately, ...), absurd historical comparisons are invoked that seem to be taken straight out of 19th century textbooks (the Goths, the Huns, ...) and most recently there is this huge wave of concern for the true victims of ISIS, i.e. the ancient piles of rocks (the Kurds and the Shi'a have been looking a bit sketchy as of late but the moral quality of 2,000 - 4,000 year old stones is beyond reproach).  I guess when everybody else seems to go mad at once, odds are that you are the one losing your mind. And madness is after all said to seem quite logical when viewed from within the lunatic's head. But I wish I found some loose thread from which I could unravel my thinking and straighten it out."
latin,36r78q,bitterlatinist,2,Fri May 22 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"No I believe it is a tragedy for us all. Our history plays a part in our personal identity and to have to watch that taken away from so many people twists my heart in knots.   The reason we don't refer to Iconoclasts of the past as barbarians is simply because it was so long ago. The loss that they caused however is still regarded as unfortunate.   Why are you surprised that in a sub dedicated to an ancient language that people are concerned about ancient things? Despite our interest I be willing to bet that if we had to sacrifice these ""piles of rocks"" to save the people being slaughtered by ISIS we would.   I find it a little disturbing that you are defending a group that are slaughtering people en masse and somehow think that calling them barbarians is inappropriate. They are barbarians both for what they do to the people who live in the areas they occupy and for what they do to the artifacts they find."
latin,36r78q,GuyofMshire,-1,Sat May 23 07:18:13 2015 UTC,"The reason we don't refer to Iconoclasts of the past as barbarians is simply because it was so long ago.   No, it's because those iconoclasts understood themselves as a continuation of Greco-Roman civilization. When we speak of ""civilized"" people as ""barbarians"" then only in the same hyperbolic way that allows Romans to declare an other Roman hostis. Calling Calvin a barbarian would be polemic beyond the point of ridiculousness, but calling presumably uncultured Arabs by that name is something I have to take seriously.  I don't use the term ""barbarian"" when talking about current events. It's an extremely Eurocentrist perspective, it leads to bad history (barbarians destroy stuff because that's what barbarians do; no need to ask further questions or attempt to understand, all you'd get from them anyway is inarticulate grunting, br br br) and using it implies a claim to Greco-Roman culture that in all honesty we simply don't have (very much the pot calling the kettle black).  As I said, I really thought we had left this kind of talk behind us at some point in the 19th or at least in the first half of the 20th century. Its resurgence is worrisome to me.  I don't see myself as defending ISIS and I certainly don't approve of them killing people. But I think their behavior should lead to us asking questions: How do they justify their behavior theologically? Why do they think it is politically wise? (that's really puzzling, al Qaida's experiences seem to point in the exact opposite direction of the approach ISIS has been taking) What makes people (who are humans like you and me) partake in such behavior or tolerate it? (you can't be this successful without widespread support) How does their relation with the local populace work (e.g. an article on the conquest of Palmyra linked on /r/worldnews mentioned ISIS distributing bread, that little factoid is a hundred times more interesting and informative than all the worry about ruins) What role does social media play in their recruiting, coordination and fundraising? What kind of interaction exists between ISIS propaganda and its reception in the West (e.g. How much are videos spread via social media tailored towards a Western, non-Muslim audience? to what degree are the predictable reactions of outrage and demonization desired by ISIS?) How are they viewed from the East - e.g. from Pakistan, from Indonesia? ...  ISIS is composed of human beings. They have families, they have dreams and they aren't stupid. To do what they are doing they must have reasons that seem good to them. The Reluctant Fundamentalist gives an extremely relatable introduction to a certain type of Islamic extremism in Pakistan. What would a similar narrative written from the perspective of an ISIS member in Syria or Iraq read like? We have to at least be able to imagine us acting the same way they do before we can talk about ways to counteract this threat. That's why I'm placing some emphasis on the relatability of concepts such as iconoclasm (because I understand why I might want to destroy idololatrous depictions even though I have no intention of doing so in reality).   Reducing them to barbarians or brainwashed members of some crazed apocalyptic cult is despicable and prevents us from understanding anything."

""I need you to give help to me"" would be mihi necesse est vos mihi dare auxilium or mihi necesse est ut mihi auxilium detis. The double mihi is pretty awkward, though, and you would probably drop one of the two since the recipient is clear from context.  As for your question, /u/EcceVulpes has steered you right.  Every noun and pronoun has gender, number, and case.  It can help to think of relative clauses as separate sentences with qui, quae, quod acting like any other pronoun and translating as something like ""and he/she/it""  (as sometimes it actually does).  Like any other pronoun, then, the case of qui, quae, quod is determined by its grammatical relationship to the rest of its clause, but the gender and number agree with its antecedent."

latin,36qx4s,Brawldud,3,Thu May 21 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"Latin derivatives are useful, they give some structure to the English language, and they don't cause any harm.   In a mock debate this is how I'd reply to your views:  Latin derivatives form a constitutive element of an elite sociolect used to shut the educationally disadvantaged out of momentous political, cultural and social discourses.  For a quotidian example just consider how the lack of cultivation betrayed by the confusion of ""to affect"" and ""to effect"" is regularly remarked upon and cruelly ridiculed within the virtual society of reddit. The correct use of Latin words functions as a social marker and reinforces class boundaries.  Expressions like ""animadversion"", ""inundation"", ""the meretricious arts"", ""salubrious"", ""a mendicant"", ""inanition"", ""to propitiate"" (to pick some examples from a novel on my shelf) serve as a social barrier to keep those out who have not and, for the improbable case that one on these undesirable souls should stray into the sacred adyta of English literary culture, to remind them that, no matter their ambition, they do in fact have not (sc. been born into the right socio-economic stratum to receive an elite education). To become cultured you have to be cultured.  How do you expect those more comfortably situated to care for plebeian demands if they hardly even speak the same language? The social question can't be solved without solving the language question. And that means the merciless extirpation of Latin and French vocabulary."

These three terms need more extensive translations to be understandable.  I guess formulae are idiomatic stock phrases and figurae more general stylistic devices but I don't know what modi refers to: On the one hand ""modus"" seems to be used to describe the stylistic quality of a text:  e.g. in a very general translation of musical terminology (""Maesia Sentinas rea causam suam [...] egit modosque omnes ac numeros defensionis non solum diligenter, sed etiam fortiter executa"", Val. Max.) or more specifically as the particular style of an individual (e.g. Quint. X.1.76), of a genre (e.g. de Oratore III.X.37 describes a modus dicendi suitable for oratory) or sometimes modus for genus when talking about the three genera dicendi. On the other hand ""modus dicendi"" and ""modus significandi"" are used as systematic terms in several contexts: e.g. a sentence's formal character (statement, exclamation, question, wish, ...) is by some referred to as a its modus dicendi, in the analysis of stylistic devices allegorical, exemplifying, poetic, ... speech are sometimes distinguished as different modi significandi, the Modists use the term in a very narrow grammatical context (e.g. each part of speech is defined by its specific modus significandi; grammatical genders express different modi significandi, ...), and so on. So I'm not sure what Foster means with ""modi linguae Latinae"" and the English translation ""modes"" isn't really helpful.   We must take care that tireless repetition teach the sense, use, and power of the language.    I read ""dominatus linguae"" as ""command of the language"".   We must take care that the Latin language pass over to the students in true human conversation.

It's a hash-up of the following paragraph of Cicero's De Finibus  But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or p37pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? 33 On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain emergencies and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains"

Written in actually good Latin those few pages are infinitely more valuable than entire volumes of Harry Potter, LotR, ...  (Parts of) Lord of the Rings having already been translated doesn't really matter as this should be about producing a readable translation, not about crossing some name off a list of desiderata no matter the quality. Take a look at the first sentence of this project:   Cum Ds. Bilbo Perans de Pera Extrema nuntiaverit, ut brevi festo specioso maxime diem natalem undecimagesimum primum ageret, in Hobbituvico sermo magnus commotioque magna fuit.    ""nuntiaverit"" is straight out the wrong tense. ""nuntiare ut"" is to relay an order but the English text says ""announce"", so we want an AcI. Word order in the ut clause is terrible, without reading the English version side by side nobody would recognize that brevi is intended as an adverb and not in agreement with ""festo"". That ""maxime"" relates to ""specioso"" is only understood by the lack of any other sensible option (the translator uses similarly weird positioning in the chapter heading already: Festum exspectatum diu). Also speciosus doesn't form a superlative with maxime. Is ""natalem festo agere"" actually sensible? ""natalem agere"" already implies the celebration and I know ""natalem festum habere"" etc. but the ablative sounds weird to me (especially as the adjective festus with an implied dies is more common than the noun festum; and ""diem natalem die festo celebrare"" would be absurd). ""sermo"" strikes me as the wrong word here, ""fama"" would be far more approriate. The repetition of magnus is obnoxious.  It's sad to think that somebody invested so many hours into this heap of useless trash. Don't be that guy.

As is my wont, I'll ask you some leaded questions to help you spot places where your translation could be improved all on your own.      Postea acer hostis Castorem interfecit et hic ad inferos (underworld) properavit (hastened). Later, sharp enemies killed Castor and this hastened him to the underworld    What's the antecedent of hic?    Maximus dolor Pollucem occupavit, Pollux occupied the greatest grief,      Try to avoid using English cognates to translate Latin words... the meanings may have changed over the last 2000 years.  Is there another way to translate occupavit.  Also, what case is Pollucem and why?    Pollux ex patre deorum ipso oravit, Pollux, out of the gods' country itself,      What is the gender, number and case of patre ... ipso?  Where is oravit in your translation?    Iuppiter autem dixit se Castori unum diem vitae, Polluci unum diem mortis donaturum esse. Jupiter, however, said Castor himself had one day of life to be about to give to Pollux, who had one day of death.      What case is se?  What cases can it be?   If your answer is accusative... When you see a form of dicere followed by se, my first hunch is usually indirect speech.  Is there an infinitive hanging out to complete the indirect speech?  If so, what is the antecedent of se?  If your answer is ablative, what kind of ablative is se?  Is there a comparative?  Is there a fruor or utor or another one of those ablative-taking verbs?  Is it an instrument-or-means?  Finally, what cases are Castori and Polluci?  It's definitely not nominative or accusative (no '-m's), right?  Is there a verb in the sentence that often takes objects in that case?  Also, the Latin seems to cut off after Homines fratres Geminos, but I'll assume that the word we're missing is appellabant or something like that based on your translation.  Hopefully these questions can help point you in the right direction.  I'm certain others will have helpful ideas.  Let us know what's still confusing after you give it another crack."

""I will most happily give my life for my brother.""   same with laetissime   Jupiter, however, said Castor himself had one day of life to be about to give to Pollux, who had one day of death.    That would be ""Iuppiter autem dixit Castorem ipsum unum diem vitae Polluci donaturum esse cui unus dies mortis esset.""  ""se"" is a reflexive pronoun, it refers to Jupiter. Observe the cases of Castor and Pollux   And so, the brothers' place changed daily.    In the plural you have loci (masc.) and loca (neutr.), but in the singular it's always locus (masc.).

latin,36fnnw,thrasumachos,10,Tue May 19 00:42:54 2015 UTC,This trigger warning thing has gotten out of hand.
latin,36fnnw,ReedsAndSerpents,27,Tue May 19 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Equating trigger warnings to fascism is ridiculous. Of course, 'trigger' and 'trigger warning' are overused to the point of meaninglessness; people (on the internet) balk at their very mention. But the concept is sound. There is no problem with a professor warning students ahead of time that a text contains graphic material. Adding a 'trigger warning' would not mean 'DON'T READ THE ASSIGNED TEXT SENSITIVE FLOWER'; it would mean, 'Heads up, this depicts rape/torture/child abuse/murder' (the implication being that, if any of those things might trigger a PTSD episode, you can read the text in a safe, private place and prepare yourself for class discussion).  In my mind, it's not much different from warning students before watching videos with needles or blood, because some people know this makes them faint."
latin,36fnnw,breads,3,Tue May 19 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"Right. I wouldn't show my students a graphic movie, say Caligula for example (something that would be entirely appropriate to show in an upper division class on Classicism and popular reception of notions of the ancient world), without letting them know that they were about to see some pretty disturbing and graphic stuff. I don't think this is any different."
latin,36fnnw,callius,7,Tue May 19 12:55:03 2015 UTC,"Of classical works where rape is common, Metamorphoses stands out to me as pretty darn rapey. I actually was able to write a whole undergrad thesis on rape in Metamorphoses."
latin,36fnnw,scaevola,6,Tue May 19 04:46:17 2015 UTC,I'm sure someone could eke out a phd on the rapes in Metamorphosis. Ovid isn't exactly Cornelia sitting under the tree by the gate.
latin,36fnnw,Vio_,14,Tue May 19 15:51:58 2015 UTC,"As a survivor of sexual assault, the student described being triggered while reading such detailed accounts of rape throughout the work. However, the student said her professor focused on the beauty of the language and the splendor of the imagery when lecturing on the text. As a result, the student completely disengaged from the class discussion as a means of self-preservation.   Based on this short description I'm with her.  Gushing over Ovid's language and narrative technique while deemphasizing the less than savory parts of his work's contents sounds just like what a philologist would do: ""just don't talk about the bad parts"" has been the discipline's modus operandi for something like 400 years (before that it was ""read the bad parts allegorically or embed them in a completely made-up context to make them acceptable"") and the only thing that has changed since is which parts are considered to be the bad ones.  If you are reading or discussing the Metamorphoses there has to be a point where you take a step back and realize ""Wait a minute, we're actually talking about rape here. Rape is awful. Yet I'm enjoying these stories, they're fun to read. What the fuck, Ovid?"" (Obviously your impressions will vary based on whatever you bring with you into this text, I don't expect a rape survivor to naively enjoy rape stories).  An idiot will reply at this point: ""Well, that's just how the stories are, blame the Greeks.""  A lesser idiot might say ""Ovid just lived in a society permeated by misogynistic rape culture"" which is not completely wrong but which ignores that Ovid would certainly not have sanctioned this exact behavior he depicts in the physical world and sweeps issues like the female on male rape in Hermaphroditos under the rug.   I'd try to open with a discussion on literary and mythological spaces. Why is it ok for the mythological world to be full of rape? Is it ok? How does this make me feel? What rules and conventions does rape follow in the mythical space? How does this relate to what is ok in other narrative spaces? What's the relationship with real-life behavior? Is there one? Would it be appropriate to talk about ""rape phantasies"" when referring to these poems? Why might this topic have been so attractive to Ovid, how come it is so central to the theme of the Metamorphoses? What literary techniques does Ovid use to describe rape? What's their effect on the reader? If (maybe) our taking pleasure in these vivid descriptions of awful acts is disturbing to us, is it likely that an ancient reader would have felt similarly? Is there an element of subversiveness on Ovid's part? How do the relationships depicted in the Metamorphoses relate to the relationships described in other works of Ovid (Amores, Ars Amatoria, Heroides, ...)? How do modern re-tellers deal with these stories? ...  I'm just spitballing but I think there's a lot to work with here and especially the motif of attempted or successful rape triggering/causing a metamorphosis is very interesting when viewed from our modern context.  But you definitely can't just focus on the language without talking about what the language is describing and what impression the work has left on you. In my opinion the analysis of language, imagery, ... should always (not just when dealing with Ovid) be subordinated to the questions ""How does this make me feel?"" and ""Why does this make me feel the way it does?"" (which is a question addressed to both your own background, expectations, etc. and to the text itself)."

latin,36fnnw,callius,5,Tue May 19 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"Rape is old hat.  Sexual assault is old hat. Every generation of human beings has had to deal with these issues.  For some reason, mine is the first that requires ""trigger warnings"" to maintain their sanity.  As a young person, I find it embarrassing.     But you definitely can't just focus on the language without talking about what the language is describing and what impression the work has left on you.     The problem is, even this will be ""triggering.""  I forget which rape (I think it has to do with Apollo turning someone into a tree?), but some of the rapes have a distinctly ravishy feel, meaning that the object of the rape is not depicted as negatively affected.  It's totally possible to not consent to something that is desirable or pleasurable and if a God can't make you feel good when he's raping you, who can?  This is the problem with ""sensitive"" people  engaging with texts like this, such a conclusion, even if supported by the text, is unthinkable.  It's possible to write a rape that a woman enjoys, and (I can't prove this off the top of my head) but I think Ovid writes quite a few of these.  Whether this diminishes or increases the horror is up to you, but it's awfully uncomfortable to consider for the feminists among us.  It's possible for a God to turn a woman into a tree and have her enjoy the whole bit, becoming a tree and all.  You're right in suggesting that these rape scenes should be a starting point for reflection.  But the reason that people claim to be triggered is largely because they don't want to think uncomfortable thoughts.  A deep exploration of rape scenes in Ovid is precisely the sort of thing the ""triggered"" don't want to do.  The possibilities are too dangerous, cognitively, for them.  That has been my experience with such sensitive people.  edit: Just to be super clear, because I don't want to be ban-hammered:  I in no way endorse rape, or think that women generally enjoy it, are asking for it, or any such thing.  I just think that it is very possible to write a fictional scene where this is the fictional reality, and that Ovid writes such scenes."
latin,36fnnw,translatorstroubles,3,Tue May 19 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Rape is old hat. Sexual assault is old hat. Every generation of human beings has had to deal with these issues. For some reason, mine is the first that requires ""trigger warnings"" to maintain their sanity. As a young person, I find it embarrassing.   Both the way in which we frame these issues and the way we talk about our emotional experiences has changed dramatically over the past few decades. It doesn't matter whether you like it or not, that's just how it is. Telling people who have made real traumatic experiences that they had the wrong frame of mind and are therefore to blame for these experiences being traumatic in the first place, that 60 years ago nobody in their position would have considered this anything out of the ordinary and that their behavior is just embarrassing, is not helpful in any way.  Such behavior seems to be very similar to me to telling a depressed person ""You have no reason to be unhappy"", ""You're only doing this for attention - but the world doesn't revolve around you"" or ""Just smile more"" - and I hope we can agree that such conduct would be way out of line for a teacher (or any other human for that matter).  I don't see anyone demanding that certain material not be taught. I see students who demand a classroom setting in which potentially triggering materials are safely taught and in which (adult!) students can exercise their own informed discretion in how they want to engage with the course material (in the classroom, alone at home, with their therapist, ...).  Adopting a thoroughly reflexive frame of mind goes a long way towards making difficult materials safe and can serve as a warning system (disengage when you notice the reflexive frame breaking down). It's not just something used to deal with emotional trauma, it's a more widely employed didactic technique: e.g. I remember that my politics teacher put us into such a frame of mind before showing us Riefenstahl's Olympia - Fest der Völker when I was 13 or 14. And so while one part of us was following the flow of the movie, another part of us was continually reflecting our immediate reactions (how do I feel about feeling this way? what is it that evokes these feelings? ...) and would have been ready to disengage us from the movie before we got caught up in it completely (Olympia being far less blatant than Sieg/Tag/Triumph makes such a mindset if anything more necessary).  Setting expectations adds to this frame - I only watched A Serbian Film after having read a plot synopsis and some analysis on its allegorical elements. Clear expectations and a deliberately adopted frame of mind helped to make a potentially disturbing movie a safe watch for me. Of course in this case I had the luxury that I would have been able to hit the pause button at any moment - that's something the individual student does often not have in a classroom setting or at least doesn't have without causing a scene (which adds a great deal to the teacher's responsibility).  I think a deep exploration in a safe setting is what takes uncomfortable thoughts much of their power (deep in the sense that you analyze a given text and your feelings about it deeply, not that you assemble a huge pile of rape scenes in Ovid). Realistically a classroom can't be a safe setting for every potential student - a good classroom might be safe enough for most students to explore their feelings e.g. about a victim of rape enjoying the act (how does this relate to my own preconceived notions of rape? to my sexual fantasies? ...) but someone with personal experience of such a situation might be better off exploring this under the guidance of a professional therapist. In such cases it is part of the educator's responsibility to give his/her students the information necessary to make an informed decision in advance. Withholding that opportunity because you believe yourself to be capable of creating a safe classroom on every topic for every possible student simply by virtue of being a talented teacher would be the height of hubris. Expecting students to somehow know what they don't know (such as the contents of the Metamorphoses) would be unrealistic.  Please rethink the way in which you are casually invalidating other people's experiences (""claim to be triggered"" etc). Just because something is incomprehensible to you or because people don't go about fixing it the way you'd want them to do, does not make their experiences and feelings any less real. As I said above, I think depression is a decent analogy, where a sympathetic social response even by those who are completely unable to wrap their head around the issue seems to slowly win out. Reserve your anger for those cases in which people are unwilling to even engage with you on the topic of creating a good learning environment for them (a process which may still result in the realization that, given your institutional, budgetary, ... restraints, you just can't do it), please don't presume such unwillingness from the get go."

If I were in any position to do so, I would be resisting some of them.  Adult literature has adult content and themes  This really should go without saying.  I don't believe that people are acting like this because it has now become acceptable to feel things.  I think they way my generation was raised has made them more psychologically fragile than other generations.  That's why it's embarrassing.

I agree with this completely.  If the strong stuff found in Classical Lit is too much for you, I'm sorry, but you don't belong in a classroom where such things are discussed.  I think you're well intentioned, but I went to school with many people like this.  My brother went to Columbia, I went to a school with a very similar ranking (don't want to get doxxed), and I've seen how this shit goes down.  It starts with them acting the victim, which they may or may not be, and it ends with them censoring thought.  It's not really about being triggered for many such students.  I'm not ""invalidating anyone's thoughts,"" I'm being critical of actions and intention that I've seen in the past.  For many such people, it's about using a victimhood role to control a dialogue and have power.  Just to restate what I said in another comment.  This is the first step.  First, it's ""I'm triggered.""  Then the well-intentioned people of the world respond, ""Oh, I'm sorry, here's a trigger warning, if it's too much for you, you can go outside.""  Then, they say ""But I don't want to be excluded."" That progresses to: ""The material in this class is exclusionary.""  Thence to, ""You shouldn't require this material."" From that point on, a class in puppies and flowers (slight hyperbole) becomes an alternative to thinking hard thoughts about difficult texts in Columbia's core curriculum."

I think the only reason why you or anyone else is taking issue with this is because of the phrase ""trigger warning"". There have been many scholarly articles in the past 5-10 years stating that it is necessary to address this issue before presenting the students with the material and more importantly, how to do so (off the top of my head, Classical World 106, 4 had a few excellent articles on this). The fact that the Columbia professor or instructor seemingly didn't employ ANY method should be the real issue, not the fact that ""well, back in the olden days, this wasn't a problem""."

It's not a matter of ""oh, it doesn't count, it's just fiction."" It might be fiction, but the experiences and issues that people deal with are real. It doesn't have to be a classroom long discussion of ""here's what's in this book and we're going to make sure everyone is safe here,"" and on and on and on, but more of an ""fyi: here's what's to expect,"" and then people can move on.    but some of the rapes have a distinctly ravishy feel, meaning that the object of the rape is not depicted as negatively affected.

It is rather dismissive and completely undermines people's reactions of ""oh, well, some of them definitely enjoyed it.

latin,36fnnw,Vio_,-1,Wed May 20 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"A person can have a physiological reaction to being raped while in the moment, but they're still a victim of violence. It is rather dismissive and completely undermines people's reactions of ""oh, well, some of them definitely enjoyed it.    You're the only one being dismissive.  This is exactly the kind of blindness that I was referring to.  Apparently it's unthinkable for a rape to be actually ""pleasurable"" for a woman (or man for that matter, think Ganymede, as he's represented in text or even in sculpture), or for a God to be able to overwhelm someone's senses in a non-consensual and non-painful/ non-negative manner.  Whether it's a realistic portrayal of rape or not, that's exactly what happens in many of Ovid's rape scenes.   Of course a person can have certain pleasurable physiological reactions during a painful rape (which of course only adds to the horror of it all): but we're not talking about real people, we're talking about fictional characters.  And fictional characters can be written to do and feel things that real people rarely do.  I submit, that Ovid (and Classical literature generally) has a range in it's portrayal of rape.  Sometimes, the victims are portayed as victims (the Eunuch).  Sometimes, the victims are portrayed as beneficiaries, and even has having enjoyed it.  That's not the reader interpreting through misogynistic cultural values. Often, that's the correct interpretation of the text (misogynistic/misandric in the case of male rape, or not): that's they way a fictional scene is actually constructed.  In other words, Ovid isn't misinterpreting a rape as non-harmful.  He isn't portraying anything incorrectly.  Ovid is the author: he chooses all the effects of his fictional rape.   I think an honest examination of that is not something that triggered individuals will be able to do without feeling further traumatised.  The result will be calls to not teach certain material.  Simply excluding the traumatised will be labeled as discriminatory against a vulnerable minority.   Nobody is saying that these texts can't be read, all people are saying is just to have a simple ""here's what's to be found in the texts.""   Not yet.  But look at the many times trigger warnings have been deployed in Universities before.  First, people claim to be triggered.  Then there's a student embargo not to allow certain speakers on campus. Then there's a student embargo on certain words or songs, etc.  Give an inch, and they take a mile."

Hopefully Columbia is above that, but who knows.  3) From what I've seen in my own experiences going to a university with a large radical leftist population, groups like this don't just seek to change the canon to include authors from different cultures, but rather seek to eliminate it so that they never have to read a book by ""dead white men,"" so this is the first step towards eliminating Ovid from the curriculum altogether."

On the assumption that my Latin is correct:  What, if we would think that the works of Maro (=Ovid) were written by some (quadam < quidam/quaedam/quoddam) woman?   And because I want my point to be understood:  Certainly we would work with them/think about them differently and would discover a lot of new stuff (in them). So why shouldn't we do it (Quin = Qui/Cur non)? What difference does it make to us (Quid ad nos) whether the ""real"" Maro was a man or not? I, for one, never met him. Perhaps a girl appropriated his name deceptively (the ""puella fallax"" is part of the conventions of elegiac poetry, i.e. what if the authorship was the reverse of the depiction in the text, Ovid purports to be a man writing about puellis what if he really was a puella?). Will you (be able to) prove that this couldn't have happened? (not 100% certain if my Latin tenses are correct here) If you should be able to (do so), what difference would it make? Ovid released his booklets into our tutelage, so that it would be up to our decision (mei arbitrii est = it is within my discretion; with verbs other than esse the ablative is used: ""meo arbitrio hoc feci"" I did this of my own will) to guide them with a placid or a sterner hand (comparing the publication of books to children leaving one's household is a common topos to express the anxiety and loss of control that goes with it, being a tryhard I stole the placidam manum from one of the book addresses in the Tristia where Ovid basically goes ""please, reader, be kind to the tired book that has traveled so far to reach you, don't frighten it, ...""). What fatherly teachings they brought with them they will soon unlearn by our hands.  At the end of the day all we have is some words on paper. We can do with them whatever we want: Ovid doesn't own his poems, we do. So why not explore how we would read them if they - word by word the same - had been written by a woman's hand? Compare Borges' Pierre Menard for a similar consideration (How would we read Don Quixote if it had been written by a 20th century author?).  Etiam nunc, ut patet, multum de Sulpicia cogito.

latin,36a9s7,jmhnilbog,7,Sun May 17 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"Google Translate is always wrong, always. Don't even bother turning to Google Translate before asking us for help with a translation.   Ad Mare Tranquillum Fugere Pudo is not good Latin.  ""Toward the calm sea to flee Pudo.""  (Pudo, as far as I can tell, is not a word.)  Also pudor, the Latin word for ""shame,"" actually has a positive connotation.  Kinda like when we say, ""have you no shame?"" in English, it meant the quality of being constrained by social norms and adhering to proper modes of behavior.  Try: a dedecore fuge ad mare tranquillum ""Flee from dishonor/scandal toward the calm sea*."
latin,36a9s7,correon,4,Sun May 17 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"So long as OP is looking for an imperative 'flee', I second this translation.  I wonder, though, if the infinitive may be more motto-like; for example, North Carolina's state motto, ""To be rather than to seem,"" is ""Esse quam Videri."""
latin,36a9s7,Lelorinel,3,Sun May 17 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"A great point.  Latin mottos are often infinitive, but there are many, many exceptions in the form of hortatory subjunctives and present indicatives: Kentucky (Deo gratiam habeamus), Vermont (Stella quarta decima fulgeat), Alabama (Audemus jura nostra defendere), Arkansas (Regnat populus), Idaho (Esto perpetua), Oklahoma (Labor omnia vincit), and my favorite, Massachusetts (Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem).  Indeed, Idaho's has a future imperative.  Such joy.  So, /u/jmhnilbog, it's worth noting that if you want to sound more formal, you could say A decore fugere ad mare tranquillum (""To flee from dishonor toward the calm sea"").  It'll still sound like the motto for a character from a British novel written the 1900s who had gone to America or South Africa because of some social scandal, but made his  fortune and now has returned with much more self-confidence and (if this is a Sherlock Holmes story) a history of muuurrrrrderrrr..."

latin,368npa,bitterlatinist,25,Sun May 17 06:45:42 2015 UTC,"""in-"" is generally used to negate adjectives and participles (nouns & verbs only in so far as they are derived from adjectives/participles, e.g. iniustitia < iniustus, not directly the negation of iustitia; cf. Leumann, Lateinische Laut- und Formenlehre, p. 3881). ""ne-"" is more commonly used to negate verbs (nequire, negare, ...) and nouns (nefas, nemo, nihil, ...).  ""in-"" changes its forms depending on the succeeding letter and can appear as ""in-"", ""im-"", ""il-"", ""ir-"" and ""i-"".  Technically ""in-"" is privative like Greek ""a-"" (i.e. signals ""lack of"") whereas ""ne-"" and ""non-"" are negations (""not"") but in practice this difference is irrelevant.  For specific words there can of course be other options, e.g. for ""lifeless"" there is ""inanimus""/""inanimis"" but also ""exanimis""/""exanimatus""/""exanimus""."

However, in all three languages, you automatically add in a vowel to make it pronounceable in front of a consonant.

With Latin neuter words it gets a bit trickier, because often they get thrown in with the masculine words (no neuter in the big Romance languages), but sometimes their plural gets interpreted as feminine singular and they end up there (e.g. French pomme from Latin pomum, poma)."
latin,366qgl,gwfe11,3,Sat May 16 18:30:02 2015 UTC,That's really interesting.  It's always been the neuter endings that throw me off..  Are there any general trends as to which ends up as which gender in Romance languages or is it just all up to the whim?
latin,366qgl,Sochamelet,1 point,Sat May 16 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well, as /u/gwfe11 said, neuter words often end up as masculine, which has to do with the fact that there are four declensions in Latin in which words typically have a certain gender, and masculine and neuter words always appear together in this. That is to say, the second and fourth declension are the ones which are typically masculine or neuter, and these are the only two in which these genders typically appear. (I hope I'm making this clearer, not more complicated.) This makes it more likely for these words to end up in the same category: their morphology was often already similar.  However, there are exceptions to this. One that I can think of right now is that a group of Latin word ending in -or, which as a rule are masculine in Latin, became words ending in -eur in French and are feminine. On the other hand you have a word like nomen, which is in fact neuter, not masculine as you implied in your post, which became masculine.  Anyway, I do suppose the rule of thumb is that the words retain their gender, with neuter words becoming masculine."

latin,365adm,Onomacritus,1 point,Tue May 19 09:42:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have been thinking this over for a few days and cannot come up with a definitive answer for you, but I can point you in the right direction and tell you my opinion.  Firstly, we have to understand that the sequence of tenses is not always followed to a t, so we cannot always find a perfect answer for the reason of every single subjunctive in the Latin language.   With that out of the way, I would say that this, IMO, is a case of repreaesentatio which is a fancy way of saying Caesar used the present subjunctive for no other reason than he was thinking of the present idea of granting them permission. (In this context he is telling what the delegation was asking for him to do, and as the story continues, he had still not yet permitted them entry, so he is thinking about granting that to them as of the time; e.g. ""they were asking that it now be granted them to do this...""  So, yes this is indirect discourse based upon dicerent which is itself a secondary sequence based upon mittunt (Caesar does not always use the historical present as a primary tense, just most of the time).  Sorry if this is oblique, just lmk if you have any follow up questions and I'll try and answer."

I wrote around 4 pages. 4-5/5  Probably missed one pt. each per short response. Long story short, I got a 5.  I should mention that the night before, I went through each required translation chapter of Bellum Gallicum and read the chapter title/headings provided by my textbook. I then printed out a blank map of Gaul from Wikipedia and drew in rough borders between the three parts (Celts, Belgae, Aquitani) and wrote in the names of the main tribes in the regions they occupied. I then circled the areas on the map where each book occurred and bulleted the events and characters next to these areas. For the Aeneid, I took notes on each set of lines and did some Sherlock mind-palace shit to memorize the contents of each set of lines. Mind-palace helped some, but was slow recall. Mostly just remembered from the process of writing out notes. Regarding vocab, over the week leading up I memorized a ~300 wd. Caesar list I made, a 90 wd. general list, and just typed up a ~200 wd Aeneid list. Didn't even memorize the last one, just helped to go through it and look up words I didn't know.  To those of you reading who have yet to take the exam: do not cram vocab. That will not work. Cramming summaries of sets of Aeneid lines and DBG chapters are fine, but for DBG also learn where things happen and where tribes are on a map. Fill out a map. It will help. Also, take note of the influential nobles in Book 1 of DBG as well as Ambiorix and Vercingetorix. It will help. PM me for more advice.  This isn't an exam for which you can learn all the material in a week. That being said, if you put forth a decent effort all year and still have some knowledge gaps, they can be patched prior to the exam.

latin,3627q4,TheMonitor58,7,Fri May 15 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"In unstressed word-final syllables, syllable-final <m> meant that the previous vowel was nasalized, kind of like syllable final <m> or <n> in French.  In ancient graffiti, syllable-final <m> was often omitted.  So it's pretty clear that in these situations, the <m> wasn't a consonant.  The thing I'm unclear on is whether the vowel itself was long by dint of being nasalized.  When vowels are nasalized after dropping a nasal consonant, you often expect compensatory lengthening.  I don't know what evidence there is around to support the theory that the nasalized vowels were pronounced longer other than poetry scansion (<-um> is heavy), which is an imperfect tool.

latin,3627q4,correon,3,Fri May 15 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"From the section: vowel length, before final m:   In most contexts (cf. p. 30), final m was reduced to a nasalization of the preceding vowel, which was at the same time lengthened. We have, nevertheless, to consider the length of the vowel in those cases where the m was preserved (cf. p. 31), and also in view of the fact that most English speakers are likely to pronounce the final m more generally, except when it is elided. The preceding vowel is in fact always short. For -urn this is shown in most cases by the fact that it derives from Old Latin -om (e.g. sacrom-^ sacrum), as -us derives from -os (cf. p. 18); such a change only affects short vowels; and even where the 0 was originally long, as in the genitive plural (cf. Greek -oov), it is shortened and so gives -urn. For the other vowels shortness is attested by an express statement of Priscian (K. ii, 23): 'numquam tamen eadem m__ante seiatura longam (uocalem) patitur in cadem syllaba esse, ut Mam, artem,puppim, ilium, rem\ Short vowel is also attested for the last word by French rien (as Men from ben{e) and not as rein from re"

Caesar talks about all the tribes and rivers bordering each other in Gaul, hence ample use of the dative.  adjectives which denote something that is friendly, unfriendly, equal to, near, similar or dissimilar take the dative.  You should invest in a Latin grammar, or pay close attention to the theme of the chapter.  If you are doing chapter 35 in Wheelocks, that's a dead giveaway that you are dealing with some funky datives.  I'm not sure when we learned about it in Lingua Latina; it could have been in the middle of the green book.  Orberg sneaks the grammar in without spelling it out for you.  You can download a grammar for free at textkit.com, but you should buy one.  Back in college our professor suggested Greenough, but Bennett is good too.

I'll look up the link to the program when I get back to my computer.  Of course, with both of these, I'd recommend first trying to find out the grammar yourself first if you want to get better at it. But it's useful to see if you were right. Also, both Perseus and Diogenes give you all the possibilities of a word, and you still have to figure out which one it actually is in the context yourself.

latin,363eeg,hopeingtobeastudent,3,Fri May 15 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"People tell me it would be better for me to just take Pre-law or Linguistics even, so while I want to take Classics I don't know if should do it or something else.   This is entirely incorrect. See here: http://taxprof.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4eab53ef0120a592d8eb970c-popup  When you read that chart though, realize that ""foreign languages"" means modern languages. Classics students tend to score up by the Philosophy students. In fact, in general the best scores on graduate entrance exams tend to go to four majors: Physics, Math, Classics, Philosophy. Majoring in Latin/Greek is an EXCELLENT choice for Law, and - given the amount of time you'll spend studying legal orations - some might say the ideal degree for a litigator.   As far as I understand I have to tell colleges and anywhere I apply for financial assistance to about this money and they are less inclined to help me with money   This entirely depends on the university, their funding formula, etc. You need to disclose this to them along with the stipulations of the trust. If you're worried, call the schools you intend to apply to ahead of time and find out what their position on that issue would likely be. I'm sure they have a few moments to consider it and give you a good idea.   I can try to find a decent state school for classics   If you do this, try to aim for a program with graduate students - ideally with a full-fledged PhD program, but even an MA/MAT program is helpful.   I can go to one of the schools like those in the Ivy League where, I hear, they give out an insane amount of financial assistance   This depends on the school. Source: I'm an alumnus of one and have friends from programs at several others.   I can't find any list that gives rankings for schools based on their classics programs so does anyone have suggestions.   This is difficult because those rankings are mostly reserved for PhD programs and even then tend to vary significantly based on what specifically you're interested in. If you provide a list of schools, I'll share my thoughts on them.   My final problem is my academic history. When my parents started to divorce, and then when my dad died, I let that make me depressed and then my grades faltered and that depressed me more.   Don't stress about this too much. You've got extenuating circumstances that you can disclose to any admissions committees to help make a case for your admission in spite of your GPA, and you've got another year to bring it up. You have a reasonably solid SAT score, though I have to ask what your Math/Verbal is, because no one really looks at writing. At any rate, your SATs suggest that there were other things going on with your GPA than simple academic ability. You also have, in theory, time to retake them if you'd like. As a friendly suggestion - unless you're a rockstar at Latin and not so hot at everything else, I'd suggest considering a different SAT II. The Latin exam is extremely difficult, and at the end of the day an admissions committee isn't going to be swayed by your having taken it any more than, say, your having taken US History. Take an easier test and get a higher score. With your GPA, the higher your scores can be on SAT/SAT II, the stronger your case for admission will be.   Finally, my Latin teacher... is a Cornell graduate.   I'm a Cornell graduate and I co-chair our alumni interviewing team for my county. Candidly, I'm not sure what advantage this will offer you, even in applying to Cornell. My own students' admissions have been hit-or-miss, even with my recommendations. One of my best is now at Haverford because we only offered her a transfer option.   Knowing all this, where would I be able to get into? are there any good classics programs in SC? Or should I just continue my studies in my free time and take a different, more ¨practical¨ major?​   It's not quite that easy to figure out. Admissions is a game that's always changing, and the rules vary year to year even at one school. There are places you'd have a better/worse chance at, but it's still somewhat up in the air. The bigger question is what sort of program you're looking for - a research school? a liberal arts college? a place that values undergrad/faculty interaction? etc. That'll narrow the choices much faster than ""where can I go?"" Also, the ""practical"" in ""practical major"" is entirely relative to your values, thought processes, and goals. Latin is immensely practical for Law.   I want advice about an impossible problem   It's not an impossible problem. To be honest, it's not even that difficult. There are most definitely solutions out there and available to you, and any number of them could lead to you studying Latin in college. It's more about lining up the ducks in the right row to get you somewhere you'd like to be. It's a perfectly achievable undertaking. (Unless you want Harvard. Then it's more or less a total crap shoot. But that has far more to do with their application numbers/quality and far less to do with you or anyone else's application.)"

People tell me it would be better for me to just take Pre-law or Linguistics   It was always under my understand, at least where I go to college, that majoring in something like pre-med, pre-law, or other really predictable majors like that generally don't do as well getting into things like Med and Law school later. What specific major is the best choice? I wouldn't worry about it insanely much about it. Once your in college you can speak to advisors about it and you always have the opportunity to transfer schools as well. No one is holding you there against your will! And there is no reason why you can't presue classics studies alongside another major that is better for law school if that turns out to be the case. Being different will help you stand out in what I'm told is a competitive admissions process later on.   That lead me to the conclusion that I have 34 options   I will in no way be able to guide you on what is the best option but as someone who didn't get into my dream school with the best program for the major I wanted to go in, it's ok! Like I said above you can always try to transfer. And at the end of the day your still getting a solid education that means a lot. I don't know what effect your choice of where you do your undergrad could effect a future of law school, but just know that you are not stuck in the decision you make on what college you go to forever. There is some wiggle room with this so don't stress.   My final problem is my academic history   I wish someone would have told me when I was in high school that my academic history wasn't as important as I thought it was. Colleges are a business and they want to ""hire"" a huge variety of students. They are looking for people they can say ""Hey world, look what so and so graduate did for the world!"" which by no means translates to just your academic abilities. It includes your interests as well, what other activities you do, what people say about you (So that recommendation letter would be an amazing choice it sounds like!). Your tests scores sound really great and even if your grades slipped for a bit, just do what you can to show that you have improved since then as improvement counts as well, or so I'm told. From a personal perspective that shows that you are a stronger person for going through what you did and facing struggles.  I sadly am no help at suggesting a program, a school, or any of that kind of stuff. But I wanted you to know that although applying for college is a big decision, it is in no way unchangeable.

Also the recipient (here, te) ought to be in the dative (tibi).  Suffice it to say that the phrase you posted is just barely ungrammatical and in unusual style.  Bacchaturi is the future active participle from the verb bacchari, which means ""to (act like / be) people celebrating the feast of Bacchus,"" which means to party or wreck things with wild abandon.

There is, however, an exception to this practice when we're using the subjunctive in an indirect question and we want to be absolutely clear about the futurity of the action in question as compared to, say, the possibility of it happening in the present (relative to the main clause, obviously). In that instance, we form a future paraphrastic using the future participle and a form of sum as logical given sequence of tenses (cf. passive periphrastic subjunctives).

latin,35o8vx,skerz0,9,Tue May 12 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"Talking about the processes of thinking is always difficult, and we often use figurative language to express these processes.  The original sense of puto, putare was ""I clean,"" and it is cognate with ""pure,"" but even by the time of Classical Latin this literal usage was ""very rare"" (according to Lewis and Short).  When you clean something, you put it into an orderly arrangement. In a tropica (figuratively), the mental usage follows from this, and it was more common. Metaphorically, you ""clear up"" any misunderstandings. You ""settle"" things in your mind. You ""arrange"" things to your satisfaction. You wipe the ledger ""clean."" The use of putare as ""trim"" and ""prune"" is derived from the more literal usage, keeping everything tidy, but again, used only rarely.  A similar thing happened with Greek logos, thought, word, etc. Lego originally meant ""gather."" It is cognate with legere and legio (legion), a ""levy,"" and collect (which is also used metaphorically, to recollect is to remember). A similar metaphorical construction is used today with gather: ""I gather she will not join us tonight."""

Then, if you have to derive from millennium, basic Latin morphology forbids the ending -alis when the word contains another l (in that case -alis changes to -aris, cf. popularis, not ""populalis""). So you could say millenniaris or millenniarius, but never ""millennialis"".  As for ""spiritus,"" it doesn't mean ""spirit"" in strict classical Latin (unless you mean ""courage"" or ""arrogance"")."

What I want is an adjective that denotes the quality of being from, or belonging, to a period of ""one thousand""; exempli gratia:  I. The generation of ""MillenniALs"" is called that because they are representative of the millennium in which they were born, due to being born at a crucial point of it (towards the end of it), therefore they ""belong"" to that period of ""one thousand"".  II. A noise is ""musicAL"" because it is vaguely harmonized, or because it oscillations create a consistent harmonic pattern.  So, if I say ""Animus Millenniaris"", I would be conveying the sense of a spirit occurring every period of ""one thousand"", but I want to convey the sense of a spirit of, or representative of, that entire period of ""one thousand"", just as the noise is representative of music, and ""millennials"" are representative of the millennium in which they were born."

latin,35m7am,prhodian,3,Mon May 11 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"""per complexitatem"" but complexitas is not even remotely classical (and if it was it would probably mean something like comprehensiveness or connectedness).   That being said while looking for any evidence of ""complexitas"" I came across a linguistic Festschrift titled ""In simplicitate complexitas"", so if the linguists think that's Latin then who are we to object?  edit: the earliest use of ""complexitas"" I could find was a work by Théophile Raynaud (a 16th/17th century Jesuit): ""Unde existebat plusquam aenigmatica complexitas ex praedicatis repugnantibus in compositum istud cadentibus"" - ""Whence arose a more than enigmatic complexitas out of the aforementioned conflicting opposites that were coinciding in(to) this composite"" (Not sure of the exact context but he's writing about the hypostatic union). ""complexitas"" clearly refers to a composite comprising different parts that are connected with each other - which, now that I think about it, is also the meaning of ""complex"" in English. When a problem is complex then we mean that it is composed of several interconnected subproblems (which makes it hard to solve)."

This kind of posts makes me realize how different languages make people think differently.  In classical Latin there is no exact word for complexity; instead, there are words for each of the meanings that our modern ""complexity"" has: multiplex, arduum, difficile (manifold, difficult to reach, difficult to do). In that sense, Latin expression would be more specific and less ambiguous, and also less abstract (what is transformed? us? things?, and what do you mean by complex? difficult to understand? difficult to accomplish? having many parts or aspects to consider?)  For example, Cicero or Caesar would have understood mutamur difficultate, arduis (""we are changed by difficulty, things difficult to reach"") or id, quod multiplex est, mutationem adfert (literally ""that which is manifold, brings change"") but ""transformatio per complexitatem"" would be meaningless to them."

latin,35elit,Serceni,3,Sat May 9 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"Nice job! I did spot a few mistakes, however, so I thought I'd point them out. ingredior is in any case a nasty one, as the i in the stem is short, which means it behaves like an i stem in some cases, and a consonant stem in others.  For instance, the imperfect is ingrediebar (etc.): all i stems and consonant stems get -eba- instead of just -ba-.  Furthermore, the future tense is formed with a long -a- in the first person singular, and a long -e- in all the other forms: ingrediar, ingredieris, ingredietur etc. This is also common to all i stems and consonant stems.  My last point is about the second person singular in the present tense: this is ingrederis. The short i before an r becomes a short e. The same thing happens in the infinitive of consonant stems; compare dicit and dicere.  Now, while I'm writing this, it's really late, so I may have made some mistakes, but I've often heard of a classics teacher who said that one should know their declensions and conjugations when woken up in the middle of the night, so I hope I can live up."

Also, to those who fought in two Wings: the City of Rome 1st and the Arvacum 2nd, and the Cohort Rhaetian 8th, and they were under the same leader, a retirement stipend of 25.  Whose names are written below, he gives citizenship to their children and posterity, and to their wives through current marriage, or if they are now celibate, to their wives upon marriage later.

latin,35ewfo,Alajarin,3,Sat May 9 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"Here's my thinking: result clauses follow the Sequence of Tenses.    There you are wrong. Result clauses do often conform to the sequence of tenses but they don't have to (in contrast to purpose clauses). Sometimes you might prefer perfect subjunctive over imperfect subjunctive for aspect reasons.   I don't understand why one would want to use the perfect subjunctive here and the marking scheme looks frankly absurd to me - terrebantur is fine but any indicative is (rightly) a major error? timerent and metuerent is fine but terrerentur is not? and why would anyone accept pluperfect? the citizens were frightened as a result of the storm, their fear doesn't precede the storm.  If I had to mark this I'd allow terrerentur and territi sint but not territi essent (and definitely not terrebantur).  edit: on second thought terrebantur is probably a typo and the author really meant to write terrerentur. Aside from the question of how pluperfect would be acceptable (and strangely you went for pluperfect in your own solution, too) that would resolve the confusion."
latin,35ewfo,bitterlatinist,3,Sat May 9 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"With respect to the question of the ""pluperfect"" subjunctive the only thing I could suggest is that the author of the schema would be accounting for the shift that happened with certain verbs where the participle came to be considered eventually as simply an adjective, which would make it actually imperfect subjunctive instead of pluperfect. This happens with some participles a lot in later Latin (e.g., confessus, constitutus, or indutus). So, it's possible that a student would write territi essent, thinking of it as adjective + esse (and not thinking of it as pluperfect) and be wrong but only sort of wrong depending on where you draw the line."
latin,35ewfo,EcceVulpes,1 point,Sat May 9 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, right, I was basically doing what EcceVulpes referred to re: using the pluperfect (and in my mind imperfect) subjunctive. Probably some English interference involved. I did mention that result clauses can take a perfect when there's either a finality aspect or a relation to the present (i.e. either to use it as an aorist to emphasise the completion of the action or a present perfect to show its relation to the present) - by 'I don't understand why one would want to use the perfect subjunctive here' can I take it that you agree that the best tense here would be imperfect and using the perfect would be a bit odd, although maybe not wrong?"

If I say someone is ""summo genere natus"" ""born from a most noble genus"" then it doesn't make any difference whether I translate genus as ""family"", ""descent"" or ""origin"". (As ""family"" genus doesn't mean the immediate family, it's more like the total line of your ancestors.)  If Lucretius writes of Venus ""per te omne genus animantum concipitur"" ""through you every genus of breathing lifeforms is conceived & embraced"", then I can translate genus equivalently as ""kind"" or ""species"" or ""race"".   I don't really know why you draw such a distinction between ""family"" and ""race"". The idea of all black-skinned people being descendants of Ham would make for a great illustration of ""genus"" if it wasn't Jewish. All members of a genus trace their way back to a common genitor, a genus doesn't have to be of a certain size.  The genitor of mankind is Prometheus, Venus is the genetrix of Aeneas and all his descendants, Romulus is the genitor of the city Rome. You can speak of a genus hominum/humanum just like you can speak of a genus Aeneadum and a genus Romanum (e.g. Philippicae IV 13).  Yes, genus can also be used of non-living things but such analogies are pretty common and the jump from a common biological ancestor to a common prototype/idea/... isn't huge.

It's like someone going around telling everyone ""I'm learning American English"" - as if being able to communicate with Americans was impossible if you had accidentally picked up British English first. Does it really throw you off if somebody spells ""colour"" instead of ""color""? Are small variations in the meaning of some words (pants, scheme, purse, ...) such a big hurdle?  And over time Latin was only added to - somebody studying Latin using exclusively post-classical authors would learn everything he needs to read Cicero and then some. Words take on new meanings - but they don't lose their old ones. New words are formed but they don't replace the traditional ones completely. New syntax structures (e.g. final infinitives) are introduced and the usage of existing ones is expanded (e.g. quod clauses) but they don't extinguish the competing traditional structures. Spellings & pronunciations have always been all over the place (yesterday I read that the change from ""mpt"" to ""nt"" was a development between Latin and Spanish - as if we'd never read tentare in Latin), just look at inscriptions if you don't believe me. It also seems to me that much of that horrible ""postclassical"" Latin is exactly the same stuff you can read in Plautus (which had probably only dropped from sight in the meantime - but never from existence)."
latin,35bqja,cinisoot,3,Fri May 8 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"There is a distinction. Different words were used in different times, different morphology as well. You would never see the imperative of esse in Classical Latin for example but it shows up in Medieval Latin. There is a difference in the vocabulary, grammar, not to mention the style, so I don't see a problem mentioning that one is studying ""Classical"" Latin."
latin,35bqja,BreckVanPort,1 point,Sat May 9 00:08:55 2015 UTC,I appreciate that. I didnt think there was a problem specifying classical latin.

latin,35bqja,bitterlatinist,1 point,Sat May 9 03:50:29 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, you're good. My advice to you is that Wheelock's will definitely give you what you need to know in terms of grammar, but it is very much just that, a book based around lots and lots of repetitive grammar exercises. The upside to this is that by the end of the book you'll have done a great deal of reading, translating, and writing, and you'll definitely know what you need to know. The downside is that if translating sentence after sentence without context is boring to you (understandable) it can be a less than enjoyable experience. If that's the case, that it starts getting too boring for you, the books I would recommend are Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, a book written entirely in Latin and basically uses a kind of ""natural method"" for teaching, or the Cambridge Latin books, which are kinda like Lingua Latina lite."
latin,35bqja,misternumberone,1 point,Sat May 9 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"Plautus is an odd choice to represent Classical Latin, considering his Latin is commonly called Old Latin. Also, if you think that Classical Latin only differs in orthography and minor semantic idioms then you've obviously never read Gregory of Tours or some of the more bastardized medieval Latin. In fact, a beginner saying he's learning Classical Latin is only oddly particular in that, if you're to learn Latin at all, you're going to learn Classical Latin first, because the few medieval or neo-Latin textbooks that exist assume a proficiency in Classical Latin."
latin,35bqja,bitterlatinist,3,Fri May 8 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"you've obviously never read Gregory of Tours or some of the more bastardized medieval Latin   Well, let's go and take a look (actually a previous version of my original post used Jonas of Bobbio as an example for how minor changes get exaggerated and don't affect the intelligibility of a text at all), I am completely confident that Cicero would have understood Gergory and vice versa.   Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus Gallicanis liberalium cultura litterarum, cum nonnullae res gererentur vel rectae vel inprobae, ac feretas gentium desaeviret, regum furor acueretur, eclesiae inpugnarentur ab hereticis, a catholicis tegerentur, ferveret Christi fides in plurimis, tepisceret in nonnullis, ipsae quoque eclesiae vel ditarentur a devotis vel nudarentur a perfides, nec repperire possit quisquam peritus dialectica in arte grammaticus, qui haec aut stilo prosaico aut metrico depingeret versu: ingemescebant saepius plerique, dicentes: 'Vae diebus nostris, quia periit studium litterarum a nobis, nec reperitur rethor in populis, qui gesta praesentia promulgare possit in paginis'. Ista etenim atque et his similia iugiter intuens dici, pro commemoratione praeteritorum, ut notitiam adtingerint venientum, etsi incultu effatu, nequivi tamen obtegere vel certamena flagitiosorum vel vitam recte viventium; et praesertim his inlicitus stimulis, quod a nostris fari plerumque miratus sum, quia: 'Philosophantem rethorem intellegunt pauci, loquentem rusticum multi'. Libuit etiam animo, ut pro suppotatione annorum ab ipso mundi principio libri primi poniretur initium, cuius capitula deursum subieci.     We have of course spelling variations - feretas, tepiscere, repperire, certamena, deursum and probably some I overlooked - because they are easy to overlook as they don't affect understanding at all. (edit: see, I read this text twice and didn't even notice perfidis being spelled perfides). We have new words that Cicero would of course not know - heretici, catholici, ecclesia (another spelling variation I hadn't noticed) - but that's to be expected as Gergory is treating a subject matter foreign to Cicero, and we have new words that Cicero might not know but which he would understand without difficulty because they are formed according to the rules of good Latin (iugiter, effatus, suppotatio). Pagani may or may not be used in its Christian meaning here. ""Prosaicus"" is the only new word not linked to ecclesiastical matters that is not readily understood. Otherwise the only problem I see in terms of vocabulary is ""inlicitus"", does Gergory use it to mean ""restricted""? Ort does he confuse it for the perfect participle of illicere? But two words out of 160 are not going to affect our understanding. Let's get to matters of grammar. ""mirare"" is nothing we haven't seen before, e.g. Varro: ""hospes, quid miras nummo curare Serapim?"" (And variability with regards to deponentia is something we see often in Plautus and later in Petronius, it would certainly not have confused Cicero. That's the reason I brought up Plautus who does of course write Old Latin: the continuity Plautus - Petronius - Medieval Latin shows that people had always - even during the classical times - been talking like this.) Gregory follows the consecutio temporum. ""nec repperire possit quisquam"" is a potentialis. A textbook might teach that subjunctive forms of posse are rare but even Cicero writes at a comparable place in De Amicitia: ""tamen vita inculta et deserta ab amicis non possit esse iucunda"". (rethor for rhetor is another spelling variation I had missed, but the word is classical). I read ""ut notitiam adtingerint venientum"" as a consecutive clause (""so that they will have reached the attention of the coming generations"") with adtingerint for attigerint (here we finally have a mistake in morphology, yay). ""atque et"" is ""atque etiam"" (""Noticing that these and also similar notions to them are being voiced""), something that we also find in Cicero ""Atque et illi, Theopompi, Ephori, Philisti, Naucratae multique alii naturis differunt"". ""perire ab"" reflects Plautine usage: ""utinam te di prius perderent, quam periisti e patria tua, Aristophontes"".   And that's all I see that someone could possibly object to.  So to add things up we have one classical word that is used in a strange way (""inlicitus""), one wrong verb form (""obtingerint"") and some uncommon expressions (mirari understood passively, perire ab) that we can, however, easily find precedents for.  Where is that horrible corruption? It simply doesn't exist in any of the big name authors.                     Yes, if you look at local records prior to the Carolingian reforms you might find some ""Latin"" that barely seems Latin at all. But unless you are a historian you'll never deal with that kind of stuff. Any Latin you'll realistically deal with, even from the 6th to 8th century, is (aside from some new vocabulary) mutually intelligible with classical Latin."
latin,35bqja,bitterlatinist,1 point,Sat May 9 08:17:35 2015 UTC,"Dialects are dialects. If Classical Latin refers to the time of the Roman Empire, and ecclesiastical refers to the time of the medieval catholic church, then there are surely differences. Not to say that one who knows classical latin wont be able to understand medieval or ""postclassical"" latin and vice versa, but the romans had their way of speaking, and the nobility of medieval england their own.   To go along with the example you have provided, American English vs. British English, there are differences well beyond the differences in spelling in words such as color vs. colour or the suffix -ize vs. -ise. But the people in england may use different words for different things, the most well known example being ""french fries"" vs. ""chips"".   My final point; A language spoken/written/understood in 49 B.C. Rome simply cannot be identical to the language spoken/written/understood in 1400 A.D. England. I have posted on this topic in the past, link, and /u/EcceVulpes gave a brilliant response which has led me to henceforth always specify classical latin when posting, commenting, etc."
latin,35bqja,popeh,2,Fri May 8 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who has only really seriously studied Latin written by Romans between 250 BC and 490 AD and official documents released by the Roman Catholic Church from various periods between about 900 AD and 2014, I've always thought of the Catholics' as ""Ecclesiastical Latin"" no matter when it was written (since it feels mostly the same to read compared to Romans') and the only thing different about it from ""Classical"" is that it has simpler grammar and words while at the same time appearing to be worded more formally and uses lots of uncommon words that aren't used a lot by Romans (like a seeming obsession with long theological words that Romans would never use and an inability to write ""femina,"" which is replaced unconditionally with ""mulier""). It's really just like a particular style; there appears to be zero actual difference in the grammar rules and I can't think of any super new made-up words by Catholics, they use original ones that just aren't common. Now, archaic grammar and spelling are absolutely present in authors like Plautus, but that's just like Shakespeare for English, it's fine. I have read certain things like Jerome's translation of the Bible, which I feel reads much like an Ecclesiastical, awkwardly worded literal translation of the original language that is in places riddled with what look to my eye weird mistakes (""seminatum fuerit""? wtf?). I have always thought of all the grammatical discrepancies in Medieval, Bastardized and Vulgar Latin entirely as errors that signify a degree of Vulgar Latin/degeneration towards a Romance language in the work, especially if the error is exclusively made by writers after 400 AD and/or resembles a feature exclusive to a Romance language. Minor spelling differences in the stem of a word don't matter that much IMO, since that's the biggest difference between ""Old"" Latin and the mainstream stuff. All this means that as far as I've been concerned, there are absolutely no such things as accusative subjects, imperative esses, accusative indirect objects, dropped consonants, changed ending vowels, subjunctive quod clauses, indicative subordinate ut clauses of any sort, indicative subordinate causal or concessive cum clauses prepositions modifying ablatives with adjectives of separation or any other inappropriate ablative, locative ablatives or accusatives (neglecting the distinct locative form for place at which) or any other such heretical nonsense invented by medievals who didn't know better. After reading this thread, I rather wonder if this is the right way to think of things; I'm just disturbed by anything it seems an educated Roman wouldn't understand clearly."
latin,35ap23,Glofkill,6,Fri May 8 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"Two of my favourite uses of this word:  ""nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux / nox est perpetua una dormienda"" (Catullus 5)  ""...o lucem candidiore nota! / quis me uno vivit felicior, aut magis hac re / optandum in vita dicere quis poterit?"" (Catullus 107)  Not least because of the way the two uses of the word resonate with one another.  Edit: perhaps I should point out that in both these cases 'lux' is being used metonymically to mean ""a day"" (or, in 5, by extension ""a lifetime"")."

latin,359n1p,bitterlatinist,2,Fri May 8 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"Frumentum metitur mense augusto, cuando maturum est.   You're using quando as a relative adverb (i.e. ""mense Augusto, quando"" for ""mense Augusto, quo"") which is possible but in my experience uncommon in classical Latin (Augustinus does it a lot: e.g. ""Nam si non omni tempore fuit tempus, erat ergo tempus, quando nullum erat tempus"").   The most straighforward solution would imho be ""cum maturum sit"".   Frumentum Italiam e Africa invehitur.   The ""in"" is dropped only for cities and small islands (Livy writes ""ab Ilua Corsicam, a Corsica in Sardiniam"", so if you want some limit on size that may serve as a guideline).    [edit: I don't know much about Latin style and I hope someone will correct me if I am wrong, but in my opinion:  indirect question (where sensible) > relative clause introduced by pronoun > relative clause introduced by adverb  to me ""est locus ubi"" & ""eo tempore quando"" sound cheaper than ""est locus quo"" & ""eo tempore quo"".]"

The Cicero passage which yields us ""Latine scire"" actually uses ""Latine loqui"" synonymously right next to it:   nam ipsum Latine loqui est illud quidem, ut paulo ante dixi, in magna laude ponendum, sed non tam sua sponte quam quod est a plerisque neglectum: non enim tam praeclarum est scire Latine quam turpe nescire, neque tam id mihi oratoris boni quam civis Romani proprium videtur."

Use Google (e.g. Google Books or a custom search over a site like The Latin Library, LacusCurtius, Bibliotheca Augustana, ...) to search texts for phrases like Latine loqui, Latine loquitur, Latine loquuntur, Latine locutus, ... and try to understand the meaning in each instance from context.

The reason I am considering it for a portion of my tattoo is simply because I find it to be a beautiful and elegant language.  And even those who don't speak Latin can often pick up the meaning of certain phrases simply due to the fact that so many languages are derived from it.  I also speak Hebrew and was considering that as an option, but even though I'm functionally bilingual, I don't get enough practice with it so I asked a friend to confirm that for me as well."

There is a big exception, however: when amica means ""friendly, fond of"", a dative is used, and the ""female"" friend is a thing or abstract concept, there is no dirty meaning at all (well, that is, unless you have a very dirty mind!): amica omnibus scientia (cf. the famous: Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas).   Incidentally, I can't recall a word in classical Latin that stands for ""female friend"" when the speaker is a male.

It's supposed to be an overkill method of doing an extraordinary amount over what is thought to be required.   I recently started doing this method for Latin as well but never got to finish it (busy with other things). What I did was concentrate 1 week on only one tense-mood-voice combo with a certain verb or two I want to practice. I spent maybe 15-20 minutes a day writing this over and over again in a notebook. Then week 2 I moved on to the next, while spending some amount of time writing the paradigm for week 1. Obviously, it would take a very long time to reach the end of the line - not to mention that you have to repeat the process for the different kinds of verbs and do it with irregulars.

I don't really have strong opinions about using flash cards, but I think writing them out over and over again makes a more lasting impression. Verb conjugation number is only for reference. You don't need to write them out probably. After doing this for about 50 verbs, you'll get the hang of the morphology just automatically.

The naming system of the imperial era was a complete mess (the male children of Marcus Aurelius include 2 Aelii, 2 Aurelii, 1 Annius and 2 unknown; doesn't even make sense to speak of gentile names under these conditions) which makes me generally more willing to suspend my disbelief in a branch of Annii Catilii (the potential objection being that this combination of two gentile names was probably due to specific circumstances in the case of Marcus Aurelius). However, such a name being stable through 3 centuries, when the mode du jour was to change your name as people change their clothes while using adoption to create family trees that would make Escher's head spin, is more than unlikely. Just having an Annius somewhere in the name would imo have been enough of a semaphore to the reader."

latin,34s2op,Onomacritus,4,Mon May 4 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"My first Latin teacher was amazing. (I'm prescinding here from the question of formal grammatical instruction to begin with versus more contemporary techniques. I learned first by formal instruction.)  If I remember correctly, it was something like this. Before we learned any Latin at all, he had us memorize this phrase: ""Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative."" The next day, he quizzed us until he was sure we all knew these five words in this order. Then, he had us memorize this definition: ""A declension is a group of nouns whose endings are similar throughout the cases."" He would say, ""You're not going to know what that means yet, but that's okay because you will later on."" Again, the next day we had to know the definition verbatim. All the while, he was helping us work through English sentences vis-a-vis parts of speech and other basic grammatical categories.  Anyway, after maybe a couple of weeks, once we actually started learning Latin, it all came together because we had already learned all these grammatical terms.  So, I learned the declensions in 1-5 order and the cases: Nom., Gen., Dat., Acc., Abl."
latin,34s2op,EcceVulpes,5,Mon May 4 02:12:20 2015 UTC,"That's interesting that you learned the English grammar first before the Latin. I basically had to deconstruct Latin grammar to figure out the English, though it actually did make me a much better English writer in the end.   I question the efficacy, though, of teaching students concepts that they don't understand only to be taught later."
latin,34s2op,EcceVulpes,2,Mon May 4 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"It was only for the first few weeks or so that he did this, and it wasn't about learning the concepts at first, it was only about memorizing the names of the cases, definitions, etc. Then, when we learned the declensions, a lot of the memorizing was already done. It was like our teacher created an organized space in our minds where the content would later go."
latin,34s2op,translostation,3,Mon May 4 13:19:03 2015 UTC,"So...  1) I learned 1-5 in that order and I learned to decline NGDAcAbV.  2) Since then, I've taught using a number of different methods, including Ørberg's which still goes 1-5 but orders the cases NAcGDAb and omits the vocative except for 2nd decl. masc. nouns in -us. I much prefer this order, since it puts similar endings near each other and makes many of the declensions look far less daunting than they appear with other orders. I also just like the visual poetics of having the ""stem"" form in the middle, like a stem on a leaf.  3) Having done a lot of research on how we actually learn languages, I'm thoroughly convinced that every textbook and teaching method I've seen screws this whole thing up. Instead of focusing on teaching declensions and cases (as if they were, in themselves, useful for anything more than talking about the language), what we should be focusing on is teaching grammatical function without tying ourselves down to any given declension at a time. We should, furthermore, be teaching these functions in order of the frequency with which they occur in Latin texts, with the exception being given to the subject-nominative and object-accusative functions which should be the first functions introduced regardless of frequency simply because it's the easiest place to start. We should introduce all nominatives simultaneously (first singular forms, then plural forms), and only after they've all been internalized should we add in accusatives in the same manner. From there we should build out, but instead of teaching students to recognize endings as part of a pattern of sounds, we should be teaching them to recognize them as part of a pattern of inherent meaning. The only way we can reasonably do that is by giving them ALL the declensions at once, but doing so slowly case by case."
latin,34s2op,Foundinantiquity,2,Mon May 4 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"(Please excuse my textwall for having a different opinion.)   I liked learning Latin cases methodically because it gives you a fighting chance to get the meaning right when you try to read something in actual Latin.  That's what I liked about Latin. It was fair. It gave you all the things you needed to know, and if you didn't remember it, you could go reread the explanation and practice grammar exercises on your own. Not like modern language classes which pretended to be ""immersion"" experiences when they only took a few hours a week, and outside of them you were helpless and couldn't figure out how the grammar actually worked, and were stuck repeating common phrases verbatim.   Latin syntax is a direct teaching of meaning. And to ensure that students can actually get to the meaning (outside of raising them  in a full immersion experience, more than just a few hours of class time per week) one needs to get them to learn case endings. That way they can actually read and practice and have a fighting chance of understanding what they're reading."
latin,34s2op,translostation,3,Tue May 5 12:57:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that the ""immersion"" tactic of teaching most modern languages ill prepares a student for a deeper knowledge/study of the language. I took an Italian class after already being well equipped in the Latin language, and it was taught in that way. I ended up finishing the class without having the skill set to continue Italian on my own, and basically able to say and understand a few simple sentences. Needless to say, it was much different than my Learning experience in Latin and imo much worse.  In contrast to that, though, I once decided to read all of A&G cover to cover to increase my Latin fluency. It took a month and when I sat down with some Cicero expecting just to speed through the entire thing, I found I was no better at reading Latin, simply better at producing forms (something which helps only in grading papers and writing Latin correctly)."
latin,34s2op,Foundinantiquity,1 point,Wed May 6 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that the ""immersion"" tactic of teaching most modern languages ill prepares a student for a deeper knowledge/study of the language.   Which method is this? ""Immersion"" is not, per se, a teaching style. There are a number of different approaches that all involve large quantities of time in the target language yet produce results that often differ widely. I could ""immerse"" you in Italian by providing you recordings of Italian physics professors lecturing to PhD students and, without the requisite vocabulary and context knowledge, you'd likely learn very little about the language even over a long period of time. Unless the instructional methodology has a basis in providing you comprehensible input, it's likely not going to be very successful.   Even with the right methods, students (and esp. Latin students) often vastly underestimate the amount of time it takes most people to develop competency in a foreign language. For most people, reaching a functional stage like ACTFL intermediate-high (B2 on CEFR) across all skill sets usually takes >400 hours of study with comprehensible input (for group I languages like Italian), and can often take >750-1,000 hours of study if L1 and L2 aren't particularly similar (e.g. group II/III languages like Latin) or even longer (e.g. group III/IV languages like Chinese). If you took one semester of Italian, it wouldn't surprise me at all that after ~75-80 hours of instruction (figuring 5 classes per week for 1 hour over a 15 week semester) you could do very little with the language."
latin,34s2op,translostation,1 point,Thu May 7 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would agree. When I was in first year, taking a pure grammar course and reading a grammar book cover to cover in my first semester did not increase my proficiency. Extended Latin reading practice was what increased my proficiency.  I support the direct teaching of grammar, but not at the expense of reading practice. And I very much support strongly readings-based Latin courses - my favourite is the Cambridge Latin Course - but not at the expense of teaching grammar when grammar explanations are useful, logical, and help the student to actually understand the words in front of them accurately.  One way of phrasing it is that I want to ""set up students for success"". Say that I taught a student the tables for amo amas amat, amamus amatis amant. Then later they saw amamus in a sentence. Context wouldn't necessarily tell them it means ""we love"" instead of ""I love"", and frequently I have students who haven't gotten on top of their tables assign pretty much any person to the verb when they translate aloud to me. But this student who came prepared would have a fighting chance of remembering what the -mus ending means. That preparedness sets them up to read more accurately, and so they get more out of their reading practice and get more opportunities to reinforce their understanding of grammar through practice, than if they had just plowed through it on loose grammatical guesswork. The more often a student reads something right, the more the right understanding gets reinforced in them."
latin,34s2op,Foundinantiquity,2,Thu May 7 14:14:48 2015 UTC,"There is literally no data to support this method of teaching/acquisition as being effective for the vast majority of the population. Current estimates put it's success rate at somewhere between 4%-10% (but usually on the lower side). If it worked for you, that's great - welcome to being one of the minority of people for whom the grammar/translation approach works fairly effectively. My issue as a teacher is that I cannot (and should not) concern myself with only the students who succeed in an outdated, unsupported methodology.  P.S. - I think you and I mean VERY different things by our definition of reading. If your method of reading focuses on identifying case endings and connecting them with grammatical function, I hate to break it to you but that's not reading. It's parsing and analyzing. Reading is when you pick up a text, work your way through it at a relatively reasonable rate, and do so with very little need to resort to grammatical analysis or reference text along the way. The only way for us to give most students a fighting chance at really reading Latin is to follow what the research says and provide them with adequate quantities of scaffolded comprehensible input - i.e. the only peer reviewed method to consistently deliver positive results in language teaching."
latin,34s2op,translostation,1 point,Wed May 6 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"That is very interesting, I would actually very much like to read the studies you have found supporting the natural language approach over the teaching of grammar step by step. I'd like to know what age groups they were working with, the sample sizes, and other details of the studies.  As for my definition of reading. I mean that the student can actually read sentences, left to right, by grouping phrases together as they go along and inferring accurate meaning from what is presented in front of them. This student reads at a reasonable pace - about the speed of one speaking aloud - and does not make many skimming errors like getting the number wrong, and is not simply paraphrasing what they think it should say based on contextual cues, when that isn't represented by the sentence in front of them."

NVAGDA makes more sense to me because the cases are in ascending order of 'difficulty'/number of different uses, and it's the order the case uses are often taught in, even in American texts.

Orbis Romanus and Cursus Brevis aren't designed specifically for university students but also get used for this purpose. Ianua Nova, Actio and Interesse consist of two volumes each. Some of these books are suitable for Latin as a first foreign language (which means a slower approach that spreads grammar education over 3-4 years), others aren't (Latin as a 2nd foreign language wants to be done with grammar after 2-3 years, 3rd foreign language after 2 years). In Germany Latin is most commonly learned as a 2nd foreign language. The unit numbers always refer to the first occurrence of a grammatical feature; some books stagger the introduction of singular and plural forms during the first few units, the functions of complex cases (ablative, genitive) are generally spread out over several units. Year always refers to the year in which the relevant edition was first released. Later prints may correct small mistakes but do as a rule not change the general structure of a textbook. Some textbooks have different editions for different states.                 In Germany we have several competing publishers (Klett, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, C.C. Buchner, Cornelsen) some of which publish several lines of Latin textbooks (e.g. C.C. Buchner has currently available: Campus A/B/C, Felix A, Felix Neu, Prima A/B/C/N, prima nova, prima brevis). It always appeared strange to me that most English speakers seem to have learned Latin with one of maybe 4-5 books (Wheelock's Latin, Cambridge Latin Course, Ecce Romani, Latin for the New Millenium and Reading Latin are all that ever get mentioned online)."

This is easily seen in the number of students who can brilliantly decline/conjugate but can't identify an ablative in context (without thinking time, some guessing, and perhaps a trip to a grammar) worth a damn.

The best way is to approach it as a native language, and speak it around your kids; however, this will be remarkably difficult unless you have developed your own speaking skills to the point where you can do that. You shouldn't be teaching them about the nominative and accusative yet, but you should be teaching them the nominative and accusative by correctly using them in sentences. Any attempt at grammar-translation with toddlers will fail spectacularly.  Also, check out Nancy Llewellyn's resource page; I think there's a video of her teaching on there somewhere.

The essential paradigm charts haven't been formatted to something more modern and colorful to make it easier to grasp, there are persistent errors that crop up (like its handling of participles or anachronistic vocabulary (like ""casa"" as house, it's a hut, not a house in classical), 7th edition in literally every chapter tries to huckster you into buying a CD, there is very insufficient explanation of grammar as a self-learner if you have questions, and even though the expanded sections on Pompeii graffiti can be fun at the beginning, by the end you just want to skip all that extraneous stuff to get to the meat of the Latin.  Those complaints out of the way, here are some of my tips as a fellow slightly less nooby noob (but still one).  The keyboard you want is the Maori keyboard, which enable you to type keyboards by pressing the (`) key.  The only thing it can't do is a macron over the Y but that's pretty infrequent, and you can just copy and paste from the character map.  What Wheelock doesn't have in depth of grammar, it demands in quantity of vocabulary.  Make flashcards early.  One flashcard suggestion: for nouns, put the gender with the definition, and for verbs, put only the first two principal parts on the question side, and the rest on the definition side.  That way you're forcing yourself early to consider the gender and full principal parts as part of your self quizzes.  Use excel to slowly make your own paradigm charts as you advance.  Much like the movie Inception, there's something about other people's ideas that your brain just kinda rejects.  The only paradigms that ever stuck with me were the ones I made for myself.  When you make them, visualize the placement of essential grammar points.  These visual placement clues in your spreadsheet will help you pull the required parsing as needed.  Also flashcard these paradigms.  Lastly, if you can, hire a tutor to explain the grammar or have a friend read to you the vocabulary.  Barring that, consider reading the whole thing outloud to yourself, recorded, and playback the recording.

I would invest now in a real Latin grammar. The Henle grammar is fine, although if you want a more comprehensive one, go for the Allen and Greenough. (Actually, checking on Amazon, it's now put out by Dover so very cheap.)  Above all, don't neglect Latin composition. If you stick to Latin to English, you tend to think of the language as a code that you are converting. If you are forced to construct the language, writing sentences and expressing thoughts in Latin, you begin to adopt it as a language.  I was first taught with Wheelock, so I've nothing really against it. But if it were me doing the whole thing over again, I would use Henle's First Year Latin (or if money was no object, then perhaps the Yale Learn to Read Latin series.) and a prose composition companion, like the North and Hillard book."

Where Latin isn't spoken often in Latin classes, and too often teachers have horrible pronunciation, macrons are necessary to show students how to properly say a word, and to prepare them for poetry. (if you didn't focus on macrons in Latin I-III, scansion is going to be very hard).  Also, the Romans did have some equivalents. In the height of the golden age, they used the apex to denote a long vowel in both inscriptions and ink writing. Before the orthography was reformed, a long vowel was written double, such as EID. in inscriptions standing for ĪDIBUS"

Grammar and rhetoric, along with logic, formed the trivium, the introductory educational curriculum throughout the medieval West.  If you want more details, read this fantastic book.  You're right about the Early Modern Period killing an unbroken line of Latin as a living language by actively trying to emulate Cicero and others. Have you ever read any Early Modern Latin? Some of it is painfully awkward in its attempt to use three or four fancy moves in the same sentence.   Nonetheless, throughout the Middle Ages there were always people who could produce Ciceronian Latin if they chose to, like John of Salisbury, but for the most part they didn't see the need to try to copy every aspect of Cicero."
latin,34fdqz,Jefffrommonmouth,2,Thu Apr 30 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"Trivium:       The Trivium is a systematic method of critical thinking used to derive factual certainty from information perceived with the traditional five senses: sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. In the medieval university, the trivium was the lower division of the seven liberal arts, and comprised grammar, logic, and rhetoric (input, process and output).   Etymologically, the Latin word trivium means ""the place where three roads meet"" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the quadrivium, the upper division of the medieval education in the liberal arts, which comprised Arithmetic (number), Geometry (number in space), Music (number in time), and Astronomy (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of Classical antiquity.   The trivium is implicit in the De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii (""On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury""), by Martianus Capella, although the term was not used until the Carolingian Renaissance, when the term was coined, in imitation of the earlier quadrivium.  Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric were essential to a Classical education, as explained in Plato's dialogues. Together, the three subjects were included to and denoted by the word ""trivium"" during the Middle Ages, but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in ancient Greece. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the Classical education movement) and at the independent Oundle School, in the United Kingdom.

latin,34fdqz,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 30 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"So off the top of my head, I would mean the use of named rhetorical devices like chiasmus or hyperbaton that would stand out as classical that seem specific to Latin or Greek, as opposed to say alliteration or antithesis which I feel would exist in any written language.    Also, can we distinguish (even though I know I suggested it) between the artificialness of rhetorical devices in neo-classical vs. medieval latin?  Or are both of them artificial?  I mean, was there a period of minimally rhetorical latin?"

(Sorry, rhetoric isn't really my field!)    I mean, was there a period of minimally rhetorical latin?   Actually, I think we can talk about degrees of artificially in Medieval Latin, which was still a living oral language, after all. Some medieval texts are steeped in Classical rhetoric, while some deliberately prefer a ""humble"" style, based on the Vulgate.   Finally, in terms of your larger question, it's worth remembering that almost thing we have in Classical Latin (minus epigrapha, etc.) has been selected and preserved by medieval people. So, in essence we wouldn't know anything about Classical rhetoric if medieval people didn't bother copying and cherishing those texts.   Where's a rhetorician when you need one?"

latin,34ftqa,beansworth,7,Fri May 1 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"These types of conditional statements are generally handled by using the subjunctive mood. The specific constructions are called contrary to fact conditions. they utilize the imperfect subjunctive for a present condition (if he were doing this, he would be wise), pluperfect for a past condition (if he had done this, he would have been wise), and present subjunctive for a future less vivid condition ( if he should do this, he would be wise).   That's the bare bones of conditions, it's pretty common to see mixed conditions as well. The subjunctive is also used in other constructions--cum clauses, purpose and result clauses, etc-- so you can't assume a conditional every time you encounter a subjunctive verb, but it is one of the main uses."
latin,34ftqa,Ambercandle,2,Thu Apr 30 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"This makes it seem as if all conditional statements use the subjunctive. Open/general conditions are entirely permissible as well, though, in the indicative. I think the best answer to the question is that Latin uses ""si"" -- and does not require a word analogous to our ""then.""

That's a good start.  Those probably go together.  And then there's that neuter acc/nom, but we've already used our nominative, so that's probably the object of one or more of the verbs.  Why are there two verbs?  Because there's a relative clause.  The relative clause will almost certainly use the verb closest to the relative pronoun, so now we can chart out the sentence, which is nice enough not to separate any modifiers from their antecedents, so we can do it with parentheses and no arrows...

So I'll chime in with a short bit of info for my university's program, you'll see that most are the same in certain ways and vary in others:  Year 1: grammar. All of it (time may require some later topics like gerunds and such to be covered at the beginning of year 2)  Year 2.1: Caesar selections and 1st catalinarian (as far as we can get); Year 2.2: Aeneid selections (from 1-6)  Year 3/4: rotating intermediate authors - Livy, Horace, Catullus, Seneca, or the occasional topic like elegy. The typical pattern is prose in the fall and poetry in the spring.  Year 4+ (often combined with grads, though they have more work): advanced topics - epistilography, medieval, survey classes, Neronian literature, comedy, epic, etc.  As you can see I only included topics. Each level does advance in difficulty, I'm in a mixed graduate class now and just recently observed an Aeneid second year class. me hercule! How easy their work load was, they were trying to get up to something like 20 lines per class period by the end where that might have been 5 minutes of my class. What you'll notice as you progress, in addition to the different speed, is that there is less of an emphasis on translation and more on understanding. Likewise grammar falls by the wayside, you won't be asked what kind of ablative or subjunctive or clause, because you should know by whatever point, it isn't less important just no time is dedicated to that stuff. Though, I will tell you as a word of advice to you learning latin, know your principal parts, verb forms, declensions and everything else up and down because if anything like that happens to pop up, chances are you will have to answer orally in a rapid fire manner (my professor, when we have some spare time, enjoys finding verbs and such from our text and asks us to give him weird forms or trick us with things like the future subjunctive*)  NB: *it doesn't exist."

latin,347bsp,senorsmile,7,Wed Apr 29 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you'll find much more modern Latin commentaries in the editiones in usum Dephini or in Lemaire's Bibliotheca Classica Latina.   What's special about this commentary is that it dates back to Late Antiquity (Late 4th/Early 5th century) which makes for a unique perspective. It's also very thorough in explaining the cultural context (names, places, mythological stories, ...) that we are missing. At the same time it's best to be wary of Servius in terms of language - similar to how modern native speakers of English read Shakespeare there's always a danger with Servius that he thinks he understands Vergil's Latin better than he does. We who have been taught classical and only classical Latin sometimes have an easier time than even an extremely well educated 5th century native speaker, as unintuitively as that may sound. And Servius is very quick to project the Neoplatonism of his day back into Vergil.  The reason I went to the trouble of scanning the pages from this edition is that it puts Servius and Servius auctus/Servius Danielis side by side (and has a very readbale formatting). Sadly only volumes 2 (covering books I & II of the Aeneid) and 3 (covering books III - V) of this Harvard edition were ever completed. If you are interested in the textual tradition of the Servius commentary it may be less than optimal (part 2) but if you just want to read Servius it's by far the best edition I've found."

latin,347bsp,sunmaster1,8,Wed Apr 29 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"So the thing I've always found most fascinating about this part of the text is the incongruity it has with historical reality. The whole notion of the Aeneid as a political poem honoring Augustus creates some really interesting problems for our reading of the sections in which Vergil actually describes something political. Ahl (in the commentary to his translation) does the argument much more justice than I'm able to here, but looking at this part in particular there are a couple of huge problems worth noticing, especially since this is the first explicitly political reference in the entire epic.  1) If we read Vergil's description of the orator's actions in the context of his own time period, it's almost ironic. When was the last time (from Vergil's perspective) in Roman history when a benevolent orator calmed a seditious crowd? The reality is almost always the opposite - since the Gracchi almost every orator in this position was either a dictator or vying for the privilege of being one, and that includes Augustus himself. Which, by the way, is immensely interesting because...  2) This is exactly not how Augustus (then Octavian) dealt with the actual seditious crowds that rose up after the assassination of Julius Caesar. The conscription lists of the second triumvirate were famous for quelling political rebellion not by using their words to calm the people, but by simply killing anyone who opposed them or represented a threat. Why on earth is Vergil using his very first political statement of the poem to paint a picture of exactly what Augustus did not (to our knowledge) ever do?!?!  And 3) all of this is occurring in a simile about how Neptune calmed the sea after the storm - a politically dangerous association for Vergil to make, especially since Augustus was not fond of Neptune at all since (a) Neptune was the patron God of Sextus Pompey, a rival for the throne and a leader of rebellion in Spain and then Sicily and the islands, and (b) Augustus himself lost several ships (nearly a whole fleet) in a series of storms in his attempts to defeat Sextus Pompey. Sextus Pompey, by the way, also happened to be Octavian's biggest competitive rival for power, he garnered significant support from many of the optimates, and he happened to be quite the speaker..."
latin,347bsp,sunmaster1,2,Wed Apr 29 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"Many good points here that I may revisit when I'm at an actual keyboard tomorrow; for now I'll just say that in my head, this passage has always reminded me of what I think Cicero must have thought/dreamed/hoped he himself could do, or maybe even had done. Though mostly he whipped crowds up, it seems to me--but the idea of the masterful speaker, restoring and/or preserving concordia was so important to him. Perhaps for that reason, I've often felt a touch of hyperbolic irony/satire here--but I'm not sure how far to trust that instinct."
latin,347bsp,ReedsAndSerpents,2,Wed Apr 29 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"I notice that Servius cites Cicero twice for turns of phrase in the orator section, so that supports the idea that there might possibly be meant to be a reference to him here."

Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the whole point of the Aeneid to white wash the shit out of actual history and portray the impossibly noble Romani as heirs of the gods themselves? Why would he let pesky things like facts get in the way of that."
latin,347bsp,ReedsAndSerpents,2,Wed Apr 29 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"Well, doesn't that depend on our adoption of the theory that Vergil actually wanted to white wash it, as apposed to presenting a more complex picture? I for one think there are way too many incongruities with this perspective in the actual text to just assume all Vergil wanted to do was paint a rosy picture of Augustus."

latin,345a15,violent_hippie,4,Tue Apr 28 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"Irregular is just as it sounds, they don't necessarily follow the usual pattern of things.  Latin seems to have a small number of irregular words, so I just rote memorize them.  There may be a better trick for dealing with irregulars, but I don't know any.  Perfect and Imperfect verbs are both past tenses.  Latin does not have a simple past tense like English.  It can not say, ""I walked the dog.""  It can only say, ""I have walked the dog (perfect)"" or ""I was walking the dog (imperfect)."" --The best metaphor I've ever heard to keep the two straight is that a perfect verb is like a snapshot of the past, where an imperfect is like a video recording.  While you are telling a story about what happened in the past, you either use perfect to show that the action was completed at the time you are referring to in the story (I have walked the dog).  Or you use imperfect to show that the action was happening at the time you are referring to in the story (I was walking the dog). I encourage people to stick with the rotten English translations until they get the nuances straight in their heads. As far as the other: nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc...drop a few bucks and pick up some Madlibs.  I know those are old school but they help a lot and can be a lot of fun in a group of friends.

latin,345a15,Mens_provida_Reguli,6,Wed Apr 29 00:40:44 2015 UTC,"A perfect verb is a verb that's specifically completed in action.  It's communicates ""I did it.  It's complete"", in a way that, say, ""I ran"" doesn't do.  It's the difference between ""I have run"" and ""I ran"".  In English, we form the present perfect with ""have"", so that ""I have run"" means that you ran in the past, but you're saying something in the present too.  Currently, I have run.  The past perfect is had run.  Back then, I had run 15 miles.  Now, I have run 50.   So you can see that the present perfect essentially comes across as just a past tense.  I have run = I had run.  So in Latin, the perfect tense means ""I ran"" or ""I have run"".  It means either.  Pluperfect is the same as past perfect, so it's saying something was completed in the past.  Pluperfect = ""had run"".  It's simplest to think of the perfect as simply like english with -ed, because using ""have"" can be a bit verbose.  That's the perfect system in Latin.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfective_aspect  Imperfect means something wasn't finished or complete.  Essentially ""I was working on my homework when..."".  It means it wasn't an action that was completed and finished. ""I used to work"", ""I was working"" or sometimes ""I worked"", depending on the context.  Nouns and adjectives can't be perfect or imperfect. I'm not sure if that's what you meant or not.  An irregular verb or noun or adjective is one that violates the predictable system for inflection.   Let's say if there is an imaginary noun, kikus (you know it's imaginary because K isn't a thing in latin).  Kikus   kiki Kiki     kikorum Kiko    kikis kikap  kikos kiko    kikis    Whereas the normal declension would follow the pattern of  -us   -i -i     -orum -o    -is -um    -os -o     -is    Since the accusative singular ends with -ap, that isn;'t predictable from the system, so we'd say it's an irregular noun and thus has to be memorized.  You can't just guess what the ending would be.  (this would never have happened like this. -ap is never an ending in Latin, but that's the basic point)."
latin,345a15,correon,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"Latin has K, just not so often."
latin,345a15,295694,4,Sat May 2 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"LatinTutorial's channel on YouTube has a helpful video about tenses.  Irregular nouns, adjectives and verbs are not (ir-) rule-based (regular).  These include a few verbs like sum (esse, fui, futurus) and volo (velle, volui, voliturus), whose declined forms do not follow the usual declension patterns you're used to.  That's it.  It just means you need to put in the time to memorize some forms: sum es est sumus estis sunt.  volo vis vult volimus vultis volunt.  Easy peasy.  The Latin imperfect tense is a way of expressing ongoing, habitual, or repeated action in the past.  This does not line up perfectly with English past tenses, but the English constructions ""was/were ___ing"" and ""used to ___"" cover it pretty well.  If you're talking about something in the past that is still happening when the main action in your sentence happens?  Imperfect.  You're talking about an action that happened over and over again in the past?  Imperfect.   The Latin perfect tense might be confusing because it can describe either (1) an action's present state of completeness or (2) an action's singular completion in the past.  The first lines up decently well with the English present perfect: ""has ___ed.""  The second lines up pretty well with the English simple past: ""___ed.""  So, alea aleam iecit can be translated as either ""he has thrown the die"" or ""he threw the die.""  You need to depend on context to know how to translate it in a single instance.   For example: Sol splendebat toto illo die, sed meridie subito pluere coepit.  ""The sun was shining that whole day, but at noon it suddenly began to rain.""  This sentence describes a continuing action (shining) and one singular completed action (began to rain).  The first is imperfect, and the second is perfect, and now you should be able to tell why.  EDIT: aleam.  Forgot to revise cases when I rewrote my example sentence into the active voice.  Mea maxima culpa."

It also takes a genitive object (you take pity of something/someone, or rather, someone is the source of your pity). though my cursory searches also reveal that it can take a dative of indirect object, since you take pity on something, too.  as such, you may want to use the jussive subjunctive (miserēris, often abbreviated to miserēre) since the imperative (miserāre) may sound too harsh in terms of tone.  ""Take Pity on the man favored by gods, for he never rests"" (the verb in the present tense, which i think fits best, since subjunctive mood and future tense don't feel right)  miserēre adiutīs deīs, namque numquam requiescant   (uses plural objects, the dative object, could cause confusion since the dative of agent with the dative object is ambiguous ""take pity on the favored gods"", but context is clear here)  miserēre adiutōrum deīs, namque numquam requiescunt   (plural object in genitive case)  if you want singular object (pity the/a man):  miserere adiut(ō dat. /ī gen.) deīs, namque numquam requiescit.   just some ideas, as with any sort of translation, there are many subtleties to focus on and depending on what you want, a different translation can be proferred."

Etruscan influenced Latin, but was eventually completely superseded by it.

""ferō, ferre, tulī, lātus"" - to carry + ""-us, -a, -um"" - adjectival suffix -- starting words fer- + o- -- stems fero- -- new stem implying ""carrying"" inferno- + fero- -- with stem of ""infernus, inferna, infernum"" - lower inferno- + connecting vowel i + fero- infern- + connecting vowel i + fero- -- ending o in inferno- disappears before connecting vowel i infernifero- -- new stem implying ""carrying lower"" infernifero + ā- -- with stem of first-conjugation endings ""-ō, -āre, -āvī, -ātus,"" as first-conjugation is customary for denominative verbs infernifer- + ā- -- ending o in infernifero- disappears before ā- inferniferā- -- new stem implying ""to carry lower""   N.B. this would create the verb ""inferniferō, inferniferāre, inferniferāvī, inferniferātus,"" which is very unlike the other formations which use prefixes and maintain the irregularity of ferō, ferre.   ""inferniferātus, inferniferāta, inferniferātum"" - past participle of inferniferō + ""-īvus, -īva, -īvum"" - adjectival suffix inferniferāto- + īvo- -- stems inferniferāt- + īvo- -- ending o in inferniferāto- disappears before starting ī in īvo- inferniferātīvo- -- new stem implying ""of the carried lower"" = ""inferniferātīvus, inferniferātīva, inferniferātīvum""   This would be anglicized as ""inferniferative."" That word would be so unlike words like ""superlative"" that I doubt anyone would get it. That's not even getting into whether infernus is really the right choice for this formation.  Stick with ""delative."" Seriously.  EDIT: formatting issues"

The distinct words of the second part I cannot make out; however, the last word could be ""hecate"", the ""a"" before possibly ""to"" for ""to hecate"" - perhaps Hecate, the Roman goddess of certain magics.

latin,33q48q,infinitum17,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"Latin is not terribly different than the Romance languages it spawned.    That isn't quite what I said.  I said Latin is more different from English than Spanish is. Spanish doesn't have a declension system and follows the same basic word order as English.     I submit that the resources available have nothing to do with how difficult it is for someone to learn.   Oh certainly it is.  Have you tried learning Sko?  I hadn't heard of it either.  I just googled ""papa new guinean languages"".  I can't imagine it'd be very easy to learn, because of the sheer difficulty of finding any way to learn it...any books, never mind any speakers.    The lack of resources makes Latin more difficult than, say, French or Spanish, because there aren't any immigrants around you speaking Latin, no television shows where they speak Latin, fewer language classes offering Latin, fewer websites (many language-learning websites don't include any dead languages at all), very few fluent speakers you can ask questions to, and, importantly, very few books written for beginners in beginner Latin.  Of course, Latin still has far more resources than the vast majority of languages on the planet.   Not everyone has the scratch to fly to Italy and study at the AVN but that doesn't mean they have trouble teaching people there.   I do agree that inherently languages probably are of equal difficulty to learn.  I mean, from a tabula rasa.  Babies.  A baby will learn English in as much time it takes a baby to learn a random obscure Guinean language.  But for foreign speakers, one is obviously much easier to learn.  Esperanto is pretty cool, but it's also flawed because of how old it was.  I can't blame Zamenhof, because Esperanto was one of the very first auxlangs developed, which means that it doesn't have the benefit of seeing what fails in these languages.  Esperanto was based off of mainly Germanic and Romance elements, and the implication that it'd be easier to learn for everyone inherently is ridiculous because there is virtually zero oriental influence, nevermind, say, African, or Native American.  It has a huge Indo-European bias.  I'm not even sure it's worth it to make a language inherently as easy for a speaker of every language, considering that most of the developed world shares a scientific/technological vocabulary.  A Mandarin speaker would have trouble with Esperanto because Esperanto has roots in romance and german, esperanto is nominative-accusative, it is SVO, and agglutinative, etc.  The closest thing to a fair auxlang would probably be lojban, because it doesn't even have parts of speech that correspond to noun, verb, etc.  Interlingua was an attempt to not focus so much on being neutral and instead was an attempt to choose a language with a lot of influence on the most spoken languages--obviously Latin--and highly simplify it."
latin,33q48q,bitterlatinist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:31:02 2015 UTC,"Firstly, great post.    I do agree that inherently languages probably are of equal difficulty to learn. I mean, from a tabula rasa. Babies. A baby will learn English in as much time it takes a baby to learn a random obscure Guinean language. But for foreign speakers, one is obviously much easier to learn.   That's what I was more getting at. Teaching methods and all might vary in both quality and availability but given the OP's question about Latin being a ""hard"" language to learn, I can't say having learned it myself as well as another and a conlang, there's not much making it more difficult than any other. The only one so far that has been noticeably and ludicrously easier has been Esperanto.    The lack of resources makes Latin more difficult than, say, French or Spanish, because there aren't any immigrants around you speaking Latin, no television shows where they speak Latin, fewer language classes offering Latin, fewer websites (many language-learning websites don't include any dead languages at all), very few fluent speakers you can ask questions to, and, importantly, very few books written for beginners in beginner Latin.   True, recently anyway. Comenius did a bang up job back in the day and while his Orbis Pictus could use a modern update it's still a great beginner text.   Esperanto was based off of mainly Germanic and Romance elements, and the implication that it'd be easier to learn for everyone inherently is ridiculous because there is virtually zero oriental influence, nevermind, say, African, or Native American.

A Mandarin speaker would have trouble with Esperanto because Esperanto has roots in romance and german, esperanto is nominative-accusative, it is SVO, and agglutinative, etc.    Yep, it is strongly European and a turn off to some people for that reason. But referring back to that chart I posted, Arabic ranks as one of the most difficult (at least for an English speaker). The reasons being culture, alphabet and grammar. There are virtually no cognates, the grammar can be a bit screwy and the plurals of anything are a nightmare. All of these things though would be true of anyone trying to learn Arabic as a second language. A Mandarin speaker would still have an easier time learning Esperanto than Arabic. The grammar is regular, the tenses are far fewer, and the plurals consist of adding a -j instead of the mountain of fuckery that is Arabic plurals.   And as if to prove my point there is an Esperanto pocket in China, as well as the Chinese government offering Esperanto for their official news podcasts.    Interlingua was an attempt to not focus so much on being neutral and instead was an attempt to choose a language with a lot of influence on the most spoken languages--obviously Latin--and highly simplify it.   It's an interesting concept no doubt. I did run across it earlier before settling on Esperanto. The part I didn't like was that it is only truly effective if you've already learned or are a native Romance speaker."

Unless you live full-time in a Latin-speaking context with other highly competent users you will just never achieve what most people conceive of as fluency. I say this as someone who just spent 2 weeks teaching a master's level academic subject in a 2nd language, while regularly struggling to keep up with some people's everyday conversation.

Therefore this could have been 'non erimus frustratio'  2) Predicative dative   Rather than the slightly clumsy feeling double nominative. We could instead use a predicative dative instead. If so, then what would be the predicative nominative would change to a dative. Rather than the basic 'Caesar auxilium est' we could instead say 'Caesar auxilio est'  Literally this means 'Caesar is for/to a help' or more elegantly put 'Caesar is a source of help' Hopefully this will help, but I'm sure how clear my explanation is"

latin,33m7rz,MagisterTJL,2,Wed Apr 29 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"Grammar-translation is the traditional method for teaching languages, in use since the Renaissance. In it, the focus is on learning grammar rules and producing traanslations into your native language, rather than building reading or speaking fluency. It doesn't work well at all, which is why modern language teachers have abandoned it, but in Latin classes, we still memorize declension charts as if they're a skill unto themselves, rather than a study guide."

However in second year we were basically just thrown Tacitus' Dialogus with commentary and told to translate it on our own, which was a huge step us from the first year. I think this is a common problem in teaching any classical language, that there is a huge gulf between working through a textbook and actually reading an original author, and that quite a few language coursebooks tend to give a false impression of things being much simpler than they actually are in real texts"

I'm one of the ones for whom grammar-translation works, but sight-reading is a different skill that I had to pick up more or less on my own, because our reading was very translation-focused.

Again learning that much words but this time we didn't have to decline the nouns. We translated the text with our little class (less than 10 people), each translating one sentence. The next lesson one person would retranslate it as repetition and we'd go on translating.  Then we went on with other authors and books like Metamorphosis.

Sancti enim doctores inter se epistolas iugiter mittebant, ex quibus pauca referre velim. Agebatur de quali planta sub cuius umbra Ionas propheta requieverit. Secundum consuetum quidem textum Latinum et pernotum valde, Ionas sub cucurbita sedebat. Secundum autem versionem Hieronymi nuper in lucem editam - id est sacram Vulgatam versionem - Ionas sub hedera manebat. Propter hoc discrimen inter versiones seditio inter Christianos prisci illius saeculi re vera facta est.  Augustinus Hieronymo scribit (Epistola 71):  Nam quidam frater noster episcopus, cum lectitari instituisset in ecclesia cui praeest, interpretationem tuam, movit quiddam longe aliter abs te positum apud Ionam prophetam, quam erat omnium sensibus memoriaeque inveteratum, et tot aetatum successionibus decantatum. Factus est tantus tumultus in plebe maxime graecis arguentibus et inflammantis calumniam falsitatis, ut cogeretur episcopus (Oëa quippe civitas erat) Iudaeorum testimonium flagitare. Utrum autem illi imperitia an malitia, hoc esse in hebraeis codicibus responderunt, quod et graeci et latini habebant atque dicebant. Quid plura? Coactus est homo velut mendositatem corrigere, volens, post magnum periculum, non remanere sine plebe. Unde etiam nobis videtur, aliquando te quoque in nonnullis falli potuisse. Et vide hoc quale sit, in eis litteris quae non possunt collatis usitatarum linguarum testimoniis emendari.  Hieronymus vero Augustino respondet (Epistola 75):  Dicis me in Iona propheta male quiddam interpretatum, et seditione populi conclamante, propter unius verbi dissonantiam, episcopum pene sacerdotium perdidisse. Et quid sit illud quod male interpretatus sim, subtrahis, auferens mihi occasionem defensionis meae; ne quidquid dixeris, me respondente solvatur: nisi forte, ut ante annos plurimos, cucurbita venit in medium, asserente illius temporis Cornelio et Asinio Pollione, me hederam pro cucurbita transtulisse. Super qua re in commentario Ionae prophetae plenius respondimus. Hoc tantum nunc dixisse contenti, quod in eo loco, ubi Septuaginta interpretes cucurbitam, et Aquila cum reliquis hederam transtulerunt, id est χισσόν, in hebraeo volumine ciceion scriptum habetur, quam vulgo Syri ciceiam vocant. Est autem genus virgulti lata habens folia, in modum pampini: cumque plantatum fuerit, cito consurgit in arbusculam, absque ullis calamorum et hastilium adminiculis, quibus et cucurbitae et hederae indigent, suo trunco se sustinens. Hoc ergo verbum de verbo edisserens, si ciceion transferre voluissem, nullus intellegeret; si cucurbitam, id dicerem quod in hebraico non habetur: hederam posui, ut caeteris interpretibus consentirem. Sin autem Iudaei vestri, ut ipse asseris, malitia, vel imperitia hoc dixerunt esse in voluminibus Hebraeorum, quod in graecis et latinis codicibus continetur; manifestum est eos aut hebraeas ignorare litteras, aut ad irridendos cucurbitarios voluisse mentiri."

De ratione enim Scripturae authenticae est, ut omnes eius clausulae et apices certae et indubitatae auctoritatis sint, alias si aliquid titubat hoc ipso de reliquis partibus, quae similiter dicuntur istius esse Scripturae, certi non reddimur; praeterquam quod in Scriptura vera et legitima nihil est quod ad fidem et mores non pertineat  Scripsit scilicet de Biblia Sacra Vulgata, versione sacrae Scripturae ab Hieronymo confecta, a Sixto V Clementique VIII edita, Sacrosancto Concilio Tridentino ita approbata, ut cum libri utriusque testamenti tum eorum traditiones (hactenus quoad pertinent ad fidem et mores) „tamquam vel oretenus a Christo, vel a Spiritu Sancto dictat[ae], et continua successione in Ecclesia catholica conservat[ae]“ affirmarentur.  Ioannis rationem mente tenentes legamus rescriptum Augustini (littera 82):  Ideo autem desidero interpretationem tuam de Septuaginta, ut et tanta latinorum interpretum, qui qualescumque hoc ausi sunt, quantum possumus imperitia careamus: et hi qui me invidere putant utilibus laboribus tuis, tandem aliquando, si fieri potest, intelligant, propterea me nolle tuam ex hebraeo interpretationem in ecclesiis legi, ne contra Septuaginta auctoritatem, tanquam novum aliquid proferentes, magno scandalo perturbemus plebes Christi, quarum aures et corda illam interpretationem audire consueverunt, quae etiam ab Apostolis approbata est. Unde et illud apud Ionam virgultum (Ionae IV, 6) , si in hebraeo nec hedera est, nec cucurbita, sed nescio quid aliud, quod trunco suo nixum nullis sustentandum adminiculis erigatur; mallem iam in omnibus latinis cucurbitam legi. Non enim frustra hoc puto Septuaginta posuisse, nisi quia et huic simile sciebant.  Non iam agimus de Vulgata Clementina sed de Septuaginta, quae versio sacrae Hebraeorum scripturae Ptolemaio II regnante ab LXXII doctissimis viris Alexandriae confecta esse dicitur, quorum unusquisque totum textum Hebraeum in Graecam linguam verteret, omnibus versionibus in singulis verbis inter se consentientibus. Haec versio et ab Apostolis ad usum christifidelium, tamquam mortali manu sub inspiratione Spiritus Sancti excussa, approbata, et ipsis ab Evangelistis adhibita est.  Unde, quaerit Augustinus, putet Hieronymus se melius scire quam Septuaginta, ut contra Septuaginta auctoritatem docere velit? Quomodo plebes novam contra Septuaginta doctrinam ferrent? Nonne graviter perturbarentur? Nonne putarentur si Septuaginta ibi errent,  etiam alibi errare? Si Septuaginta compluribus locis errent, etiam Apostolos ea approbantes erravisse? Sin autem Apostoli erraverint, tota doctrina Christiana, quae nobis eorum ex oribus tradita sit, labefacta.  Augustinus ultra monet Hieronymi verbum tranquillam fidelium consuetudinem dirumpere.  Sunt sane qui dicunt consuetudinem nihil in rebus ad religionem pertinentibus valere. Miror an umquam e suis musaeis excesserint?                Fidelibus religio est ceu liberis patria domus, in qua nata et educata sunt, ubi primos suos magistros atque sodales invenere, cuius odores soni colores iis bene soliti sunt, qua omni tempore tuti confugere possunt. Incolis absentibus latrones patrias fores effregerunt, domum ingressi sunt, tantumque - mirabile dictu - vilissimam rerum unam abstulerunt. Dominus post reditum suum damnum facile restituit, immo raptum non modo aequat sed domum melioribus auget. -- At frustra molitur. Familiaris foci consuetudo dirupta, omnis tutela dissipata, domus ipsis incolis aliena facta.  Egomet, qui Germanus sum, quotannis denuo animadverto de quo locutus sum. Fuit enim consuetudo Protestantibus theodisce ""Gloria in altissimis Deo, et super terram pax et hominibus gaudium"" („und den Menschen ein Wohlgefallen“), Catholicis autem ""Gloria in altissimis Deo, et super terram pax in hominibus benevolentibus"" („bei den Menschen guten Willens“) legere. Nam Martinus Luther in sua versione conficienda usus est textu Graeco in quo ""ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία"" pro ""ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκίας"" scriptum erat; contra Catholici „in hominibus bonae voluntatis“ (quod ponit Vulgata) male intellexerunt. Omnibus nunc emendatis et Protestantes et Catholici ""in hominibus ei gratis/eius gratiae/eius benevolentiae/..."" („bei den Menschen seines Wohlgefallens/seiner Gnade“) legunt atque populis utriusque fidei illa fabula quam prima a pueritia totiens audivere narravere edidicere, aliena facta est. Num emendendi operae pretium erat?   Hactenus quaestionis explanatio.  Eo tempore plus scribere non valeo sed fortasse ad hanc quaestionem revertam. Multa enim in constitutione ""Dei verbum"" superscripta praefationibusque Vulgatae Novae reperiuntur, quae cum tempus sinit nobis tractanda sunt."

She has a better control and understanding  of the grammar and can speak Mich more eloquently than she could had she not taken Latin.  This to me is proof that Latin has direct application as an investment in your own intellectuality. It is one of many ways that you can broaden your understanding of the world and knowledge and stuff."
latin,33k2aj,NLBuescher,2,Thu Apr 23 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"There are a few strong reasons to learn Latin (and/or Ancient Greek &c.):  The benefits within the medical and scientific field have already been outlined, but this can be applied more generally:  Although not a descendant, the English language has a lot of words which stem from Latin. Having a good knowledge of Latin will allow you understand the etymology of many words in English. This, at first, may not seem like a very good reason, but its the application of this knowledge that is beneficial. Understanding the etymology of words will allow you to have a deeper understanding of its meaning, which will in turn allow you to use it more effectively in writing especially where precision of meaning is essential and even sometimes when concocting new words.   Learning Latin is also a great way to help understand your knowledge of the structure of language. To read and write Latin effectively, you needs to understand every word's function in a sentence. This is the importance of Grammar. Having knowledge of Latin grammar will allow you to break-down your own language and gain a better understanding of its structure. Applying knowledge of grammar to actual Latin sentences will also help with your analytical skills; not only to you have to apply the 'rules' of grammar, but since some grammatical declensions can look identical, context may need be applied as well. You'll find that if you know Latin, learning another language will become easier even if it does not use Latin words as the grammatical structures and concepts will now be familiar to you.  Latin is used in many different fields including science, mathematics, medicine, law, history &c. and although knowing the difference between Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis just from the knowing the names may not seem beneficial, having a good overview and understanding the motivation for names is real academic advantage.   The same points about improving the knowledge of one's own language and understanding better the structure of a language can of course be applied to many other languages, but the advantage of Latin is that there is a large corpus of text written in Latin, some of which are amongst the most important and influential in human history from science to music.  In short, Latin can give you both a good insight into the development of language and at the same time be a great intellectual challenge."
latin,33k2aj,Kestar_1,2,Fri Apr 24 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"It is literally the vehicle language for the vast majority of the most important ideas and literary texts in the western tradition from ~200 BC - 1800 AD, and even after the vernacular languages started taking over it remained essential to a 'good education' into the 1900s in many places, meaning that even works never written in Latin are still heavily influenced by it in terms of style and content. If you want to understand western history, you have to know Latin."
latin,33k2aj,translostation,2,Fri Apr 24 02:04:23 2015 UTC,It is extremely easy to grasp the Romance language with a solid Latin background. Developing competency in it lets you see the way the others changed.   The staggering literary tradition.   /u/Kestar_1 is also quite correct about knowing the etymology of many English words. Even after mastering the language I used to run into five dollar words that I'd never seen before. Still do rarely but a vast majority of the time they're Latin bastardizations that I recognize immediately. The last time I had to look up a word reading a book cover to cover was one I'd never seen in my life before or since and it turned out to be a Welsh word a British writer felt the need to pull out of nowhere.

Knowing it allows you to access a great & venerable literary tradition, but that's pretty much it.  Most of the Latin corpus is not available in translation (or in any modern editions) but it's not like your average student is dying to read obscure 17th century texts. The great classical works are available in translations that are as good as translations can be.  Future historians studying the 21st century will have to learn our vernacular languages anyhow, so us producing Latin texts won't be of much help to them."
latin,33k2aj,bitterlatinist,6,Thu Apr 23 07:31:04 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Latin (and to a lesser extent Greek) is far more relevant than Sanskrit or Coptic or whatever since so much modern vocabulary is derived from Latin.

For anyone that does a lot of writing, too, studying Latin really benefits your use of many modern languages."

My advice: read shorter sentences, slowly progress to longer ones.  Reading a text word by word is tying both hands behind your back. What's the point of thinking up half a dozen possibilities what ""ut"" might mean when its meaning will become perfectly clear within the next few words. It's not like your brain does this when reading normally, you just keep the word suspended until its meaning reveals itself, you don't try to process every single possibility.  Have you tried listening to spoken Latin? Do you have the same issue there?"
latin,33jlgk,bitterlatinist,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:17:54 2015 UTC,"I wish I could have more experience with spoken Latin, but I can't find resources that really help - everything I come across is either too advanced or so simple, slow, and predictable, that no actual ability is required. I don't live in an area with a lot of Latin speakers, or really even folks that know the difference between Latin and Latin-American. Do you know of some good resources for spoken Latin?   I think perhaps it's less about the word order and more about the command of vocabulary, specifically the wide variety of ways objects are marked. I didn't really have the same kind of trouble with elementary Farsi (picked up some at work back in the day), because objects are marked one way only. Any suggestion for this beyond rote memorization of forms? That's really the only approach I know now. Thanks!"
latin,33jlgk,vossbot,2,Thu Apr 23 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"I think perhaps it's less about the word order and more about the command of vocabulary   This is one huge challenge for many students. Without a thorough command of vocabulary, it's difficult to read anything no matter how well you know your grammar and forms. The best way to get around this is to stop trying to learn vocabulary words as individual lexical items (what I call the 'index card' method, though it's not dependent on that medium) and start learning them in meaningful contexts. One really good way to do that is to learn vocabulary thematically (""religion"", ""the home"", ""war"", etc.). Another option is to practice synonyms/antonyms - how many ways can you say ""but"" in Latin? Whatever you do, try to practice the vocabulary actively by using it. I like to write stupidly-simple dialogues and stories. I don't focus much on grammar/syntax (i.e. the goal isn't 'ornate' Latin, just using Latin words), but I try to use new words in contexts that are memorable and make connections for me quickly.   Any suggestion for this beyond rote memorization of forms? That's really the only approach I know now.   Aside from engaging in active sessions with an experienced teacher (TPR or TPRS are really good for this), the best options I've run across all involve (1) copious amounts of reading at a comprehensible level of input (think very basic Latin - there are plenty of free or inexpensive options for texts), and (2) practice in manipulation drills IN Latin (e.g. active <--> passive, personal <--> impersonal, regular verb <--> deponent verb, indicative clause <--> subjunctive clause, direct speech <--> indirect speech, etc.). Tunberg and Minkova's composition text is really good for this, but my first recommendation would be that you exhaust the resources associated with the Lingua Latina series first. There are several exercise books and readers to accompany each text, so there are plenty of drills and readings for you to work with."

latin,33jlgk,Veqq,6,Mon Apr 27 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"Great question. In my experience, it's definitely scalar. If you can read salve and know what it means without parsing and translating it, then you've got a foot on the ladder.  For me it depends on what it is. I read mostly medieval texts and especially get locked into specific authors, so I tend to get into a sort of groove with them, which also means that if I switch to something of a very different style (e.g., a leap from Aquinas to Vergil), I start noticing the language again until I get into that groove. It's something like going from reading the newspaper to reading Shakespeare: All of a sudden the language stands out and seems weird.  Actually, one difficulty is that not infrequently I am supposed to be translating the text I am working with, which is annoying because it's much slower than just reading it. You have to engage with two languages and constantly switch between them. Sometimes I look over at the English side of the screen and see that I have written the same thing I just read in Latin in Latin again.  The first time I noticed that I wasn't mentally translating was in school where I realized I had written et in the middle of an English sentence on my Latin homework.  What I really need to work on are my active skills. When I speak Latin, for example, I make all kinds of mistakes, usually ones I'm aware of as I'm making them."

We focus on using Latin in a conversational manner, not just as a tool to translate the ancients. My classmates and I text each other in Latin and tell each other about our days in Latin; nobody ever needs to run to the dictionary.  I'm in end of my second year of this and we are now reading Historia Apollonii Tyrii, a story from around the second century. While we of course don't know all of the words written in the story, I can usually make my way through a chapter and understand most of what is happening before looking anything up. Last night for example I read a chapter (about a page, the chapters are usually fairly short) and underlined every word I didn't know. I ended up with less than 20 words to look up, the rest I understood without issue. When we first started reading the story however, my list of vocab was more likely to be about a page and a half long."

latin,33e8ge,Grolser,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"How about you tell that to Jerome? Many Hebrew names are indeclinable in Latin.  The good reason here is that ""redditus"", ""redditor"", ... would be misunderstood as being derived from reddere. A redditor is someone who returns something, a 4th declension redditus is the act of giving something back.  The name ""reddit"" may be Latin-inspired but it's ultimately English. Latinizing it only leads to confusion."
latin,33e8ge,bitterlatinist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Ich weiß nicht, was bei euch indeclinable heißt. Indeclinable heißt bei uns in Deutschland, dass das Wort (Substantiv) nur in einer Form auftreten kann wie nefas, fas etc. Ich habe nur das Gefühl, dass ihr etwas vollkommen anderes meint, nämlich dass das Wort unverändert im Nominativ ins Lateinische kommt, also im Nominativ reddit heißen würde. Dass es in allen weiteren Kasus auch reddit heißen soll, halte ich für einen Fehler."
latin,33e8ge,Grolser,2,Wed Apr 22 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Es macht wenig Sinn Wörter aus völlig fremden Sprachen (wie z.B. dem Englischen) in das lat. Deklinationssystem zu zwingen.  Viele hebräische Begriffe wie z.B. manna, Cain und Chanaan werden im Lateinischen nicht dekliniert. Ebenso manche fremde Ortsnamen (z.B. Caere was ja wohl ein etruskischer Name sein wird) und viele griechische Pflanzen und Gewürznamen (z.B. cappari).  redditus, -us m. ist zwar nicht bezeugt, ist aber ein korrekt geformtes lateinisches Wort, welches ""das Zurückgeben, das Abgelten"" bedeutet (man kann eigentlich immer ein Substantiv der u-Deklination aus dem PPP bilden, das dann die Tätigkeit bezeichnet; vgl. cursus, aditus, visus, auditus, ...).  Was nützt es dieses lateinische Wort in einer völlig anderen Bedeutung als Namen zu verwenden? so etwas führt doch nur zu Missverständnissen.  Ein existierendes Wort wie ""raeda"" für Auto zu benutzen ist eine gute Wahl, da ein Satz in dem raeda Auto bedeutet (""raeda Romam vehemur"") in seiner Essenz auch von jedem, der raeda nur in der antiken Bedeutung kennt, verstanden wird (ob der Wagen jetzt motorisert ist oder nicht, macht i.d.R. keinen großen Unterschied und kann dem Kontext überlassen werden).  Ein (potentiell) existierendes Wort wie ""redditus"" für reddit zu verwenden ist irrsinnig, da hier gar keine Parallele zwischen der eigentlichen Wortbedeutung (das Zurückgeben) und der Verwendung besteht. Wenn du Wörter so verwendest würde weder Cicero deinen Text verstehen, noch jemand der ihn in 500 Jahren liest.   Indem du ""reddit"" undeklinierbar belässt, machst du deutlich, dass es sich um ein Wort aus einer fremden Sprache und vermutl. um einen Namen handelt (das es nicht das lat. Verb sein kann wird, sollte durch die Syntax klar sein). Das hilft deinem Leser mehr als ihn mit einem unverständlich verwendeten lateinischen Wort zu verwirren."

latin,33gjk1,deganu,3,Wed Apr 22 10:08:34 2015 UTC,"Your case is incorrect for ""invicti"" and ""anima."" The adjective has to agree with the noun.  Now - you have a few options as to what you want the verb to be. The first one is what you have right now - habeo, habere means ""to have,"" ""to hold,"" or ""to consider"" (to hold in your mind). Personally, I think that this is a little too concrete; you hold a book or a sword, not something as intrinsic to you as your inner spirit. In any case, the Romans didn't believe your spirit to be in your brain; they thought it was in your heart and your breath. Anima also has a secondary meaning of ""breath"" or ""wind."" Animare, which is the verb form of the noun, literally means ""to breathe life into."" We get ""animate"" from it.  Another option is ""sum,"" which means ""I am."" This is a great option, as it describes something that is intrinsic to you. In this case, Vossbot's translation is great, and it's anima invicta sum.  One more option is the verb factus sum, which means ""I have become"" or ""I was made."" This carries the connotation that something made you an invincible spirit, like a formative experience.  In this case, because you're female, it would be Anima invicta facta sum.  Finally, you can rearrange the word order to emphasize the words you want. Personally, I'd want invicta to go first, as you are putting the emphasis on your spirit being invincible.  So, I'd write it as the following: Invicta anima facta sum."
latin,33gjk1,POGtastic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"Would Invicta anima sum work, since I would be putting emphasis on the invicta, and it would lean more toward ""i am intrinsically invincible"" vs the ""i have become/been made into one who is invincible."" (instead of with the facta part)"
latin,33gjk1,POGtastic,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that works perfectly."
latin,33gjk1,vossbot,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that would not be correct. If you wanted to use those words, it would be animam invictam habeo, but I'm not sure the words would be 100% correct, depending on the sense of ""spirit"" (will defer to a more experienced person for that).  Edit: if you wanted to use the same words but say ""I am"" instead of ""I have,"" it would be anima invicta sum. But again, I'd double check with another that the usage of the words would be correct."
latin,33gjk1,Jaelre,0,Wed Apr 22 10:17:53 2015 UTC,"Just in case, adding to the other 2 answers: your translation means ""I have the soul of an invincible one (male)"".

The Cnaeus/Gnaeus problem is, as far as I understand, a matter of differentiation of a sound by letter, not so much one of actual pronunciation, (see also, for instance, Gaius always being ""C"" on inscriptions [and from that source, also in abbreviation]), though it may be that these changed in pronunciation very early but stuck as part of inscription (not my speciality). My assumption in this case, then, especially coming from the Greek kn, is that this one would officially sound as it looks, but that it would probably slide in varying degrees, which, now that I think about it, hasn't turned into a very insightful statement.  EDIT: Here is at least some sort of evidence, that of William Smith's tome on everything antique, which is now itself antique (h/t to this guy for hunting down the exact page which I sought for some time):   ""According to William Smith, Carvilius did this [i.e., added the G] in the ""beginning of the sixth century of the city"". Smith also says:  Dict. Bio & Myth, p. 196:  ""Caius was undoubtedly the original spelling, used at a time when the letter C, which occupies in the Roman alphabet the place of Gamma in the Greek, had, in some cases, the power of Gamma. Caius was always pronounced Gaius..."" """
latin,33ejry,Flavus516,2,Tue Apr 21 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"This info about Gaius is a bit incomplete.  Gaius is attested in v. old inscriptions as Gavius, a form that was maintained as a Latin gentilicum; see e.g. the 'Tibur Pedestal' inscription KAVIOS. (K here = 'G'.) Gnaeus is often connected to an Etruscan form Cneve (or similar), to which cf. the form GNAIVOD from the Scipio epitaphs.    It's probable that as pronunciation of the GN- initial cluster was eliminated (and other internal changes occurred) in later Latin, the two names became increasingly similar in pronunciation, at least internally."

latin,33ejry,gordiep,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find a proper English translation, but here is what Julius Paris, whoever on Earth he is, says in the 4th or 5th century CE about it:  ""Quod unum praenomen varia scriptura notatur: alii enim Naeum, alii Gnaeum, alii Cnaeum scribunt. Qui G littera in hoc praenomine utuntur, antiquitatem sequi videntur, quae multum ea usa littera est. Olim enim dicebatur frugmentum, nunc frumentum effertur, et forgtis, non fortis, et gnatura, non natura. Ergo etiam qui in corporibus gigni solet gnaevus adpellabatur. Qui CN ponunt, asperatione syllabae delectari videntur, qui Naeus, lenitate.""    Very sloppy go at it just off the page:   ""That one name is noted with varied writing: Some write Naeus, some Gnaeus, and some Cnaeus. Those who use the letter G in this praenomen, they seem to follow antiquity, which used this letter a lot. For once frugmentum was said, now it is spoken frumentum, et forgtis, not fortis, et gnatura, non natura. Therefore indeed that which is accustomed to grow on bodies was called gnaevus. Those who put CN, they seem to be charmed by the aspiration of the syllable, those who put Naeus, by its smoothness.""  There's a lot to be said about how reasonable and true what he's saying is, but here's an ancient account nonetheless."
latin,33ejry,Flavus516,2,Tue Apr 21 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"Latin actually inherited a number of words that began with the cluster gn-, as it occurs in the PIE roots behind several prominent Indo-European words (e.g. *ǵneh3, which became Latin (g)nōscō, Greek γιγνώσκω, and English know, among other things).  Moreover, roots in the zero grade could also generate this sequence in Latin (e.g. *ǵenh1 > Latin (g)nāscor, Greek γίγνομαι, English kin).    But, by the Classical Latin period (basically anything after mid-1st c BCE), nearly all of these sequences had been reduced in Latin when word-initial, with the exception of a few 'frozen' forms in proper names, and, as you point out, loan-words.  You will find e.g. gnātus retained in 'archaic' authors such as Ennius and Cato, but even here it's something of a question whether it was 'really' pronounced or not.  Note too that there's good evidence that in the interior of words (as in e.g. ignis) this cluster was pronounced as [ngn], as in English haNGNail.  (For more on this and lots of other great phonology info, see esp. Allen's excellent Vox Latina book, p.23ff.)  In the example that you provide, the question of whether the initial 'c' was pronounced has kind of a tricky answer, namely, ""it depends"".  For educated speakers who knew the provenance of the word and were educated in Greek, then the pronunciation was probably very specific, though I would suspect that the initial velar was probably voiced, due to the following voiced nasal.  But, whether more ""everyday"" speakers would have pronounced it as such is open to debate; cf. English know, which was once pronounced with the initial velar, but now decidedly is not, even by educated speakers.  If the word was in general circulation and wasn't restricted to written usage, then normal Latin phonotactic rules would have eventually eliminated (or at least severely minimized) this beginning cluster."

latin,33b7hp,Foundinantiquity,5,Tue Apr 21 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"What's your source on the bolinus brandaris bit? Colors vary a lot across culture. If you haven't heard it, this radiolab is really great. Where we put the boundaries on ""purple"" really can't match 1:1 with the Romans' purpureus. Just looking through some examples in L&S, I see blood, fire, a blushing face, poppy, the sea and wine, none of which are properly called purple in English unless we're being a little flowery with our language. Whether or not our Latin authors are being flowery, I really can't say.   I think you're justified in calling purpureus ""purple"" for the purpose of translation, but it's not just purple."
latin,33b7hp,Mens_provida_Reguli,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your nuanced replies.   murex (=bolinus) brandaris was stated as perhaps the main animal used for purple dye production in the OLD, but having done a little more searching around it seems wiser to say that there were three main sea snails:    Purple dyes are obtained from several marine shellfish of the Muricidae and Thaisidae families, but Tyrian or Royal Purple from Bolinus brandaris (formerly known as Murex brandaris), Hexaplex trunculus (formerly known as Murex trunculus), and Stramonita haemastoma (formerly known as Purpura haemastoma) were the most highly prized.    Source: https://www.academia.edu/5749854/Purple_Murex_Dye_in_Antiquity  I haven't found good examples of people in modern times extracting the dyes from the other two snails. (This youtube video for murex trunculus only very briefly shows the purplish colour of the developed pigment, and in poor lighting) So I guess if they did produce red cloth, and were still considered to make Tyrian purple dye, then I guess there's a case to consider Tyrian purple-dyed cloth red in that circumstance.  \2. Again thanks for your insight. Colour words can be tricky when applied to different categories of object. I remember as a kid I felt really annoyed when people told me that a certain dog was blue, when to me it was clearly speckled grey and not blue. I certainly wouldn't call a piece of concrete blue even if it was the colour of that dog. In the same way, even though I now use the word ""blue"" to describe grey dogs, that doesn't make me inclined to call a piece of grey cloth blue.   In this case, I'm glad that you noted that other things may be considered purpureus. Thanks for pointing that out. I guess what I was more concerned about was people's choice of colour for their purple-toga-stripe, which depends on what the dye of the murex snails looked like, even though the word purpureus can be used for non-clothing items in a wider sense of colour.   (And possibly, taking EcceVulpes' suggestion, from at least the middle ages, it seems that the term purpureus could have described the colour of the scarlet cardinal's clothing? I can't quite work out whether the pope's decree in 1467 that the cardinal's robe be dyed with imported Kermes red dye should be interpreted to mean that the robe was a different shade of colour before or not.)"
latin,33b7hp,EcceVulpes,3,Thu Apr 23 14:04:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting. My understanding has been that purpureus covers a broader range of colors than ""purple,"" including red but also some kinds of purple.  I have seen purpureus used to describe blood.  To this day, Cardinals of the Catholic Church are referred (or can be) as Patres purpurati or as being honored with sacra Romana purpura, terms clearly indebted to pre-Christian Roman culture."
latin,33b7hp,Flavus516,3,Tue Apr 21 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"As for the word itself, OLD guesses that purpura is ""perhaps chiefly Murex brandaris (i.e., bolinus brandaris, as you stated)"", though I'm not sure where they get it from. They wisely take the high road and declare it ""the purple dye...ranging in shade from blood-red to deep violet"". Consider, e.g., Pliny in his Natural History when he states   ""[frutex] rubens aut in purpuram vergens"" (24.112)   which suggests a pretty hazy border between reds and purples. Again, in Ovid's Remedy of Love, he talks of Nisus' hair with   ""Haesisset capiti purpura, Nise, tuo"" (line 68)  where it has to seem unlikely that Nisus' hair is literally purple when deep red is an option on the table.   (Edit: I'll go ahead and caveat this one ahead of time on the grounds that the story is by nature fantastical and in Greek, whence this story arose, πορφύρα seems to have somewhat less ambiguity according to Liddell and Scott, speaking all the more to the cultural phenomenon perhaps happening in the Latin world. I still think it's possible that the Latin misconstrues the original and leaves ""deep red"" entirely acceptable.)  My guess is that the exact shellfish, exact method, exact material placed on, and a slow evolution of the word vulgarly and poetically simply shades it more broadly (beyond the perfectly good observation by /u/Mens_provida_Reguli that color understandings vary across cultures widely)."

latin,337jh4,dmstewar2,6,Mon Apr 20 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Cicero sentence, it seems to me your rearrangement weakens the rhetoric quite a bit. He starts with a shockingly strong 'ad mortem te, Catilina' and only qualifies it later with 'oportebat'. It would be significantly weaker to start with oportebat, already rendering whatever follows as hypothetical.  I'm reminded of Tony Blair giving a speech in support of the Iraq war, and saying ""there is no doubt ... in my mind,"" that Iraq has WMDs. It would have not had the same persuasive force if he'd said ""in my mind ... there is no doubt."""
latin,337jh4,Frobeniu5,5,Mon Apr 20 08:31:40 2015 UTC,"Actually on 2nd reading I see the force of ad mortem TE, Catalinam!, duci iussu (consulis) iam pridem opportebat. God I love Cicero's choice of words and his order.  It is quite satisfying if you let yourself hear it. I'm just having a personal problem as an English speaker coming to terms with Latin's flexible word order and its subtletly with respect to the subtext of that order. It's actually a very hard topic to broach here.  I def see the diff in force with TB. God I can only imagine being there for this speech."
latin,337jh4,bitterlatinist,2,Mon Apr 20 09:13:30 2015 UTC,"All the rage, the weird impersonal constructions (""it would have been right if you had already been killed on order of a consul long ago""), the self-accusations (o tempora, o mores), the pleading with Catilina to leave of his own volition are smoke and mirrors to obscure the fact that all Catilina has to do is call the bluff.  Just look how the two interjections of Catilina (num in exsilium? and refer ad senatum!) send Cicero squirming. Catilina knows that Cicero is too much of a pussy to kill him outright (because that would pull Cicero down with him) and he knows that at least for the moment he still has enough support in the senate to survive a vote.   I find it hard to believe that Cicero's speech had any part in Catilina ""fleeing"" Rome, it seems more likely to me that Cicero knew Catilina would have to leave very soon and decided to capitalize on that fact. Catilina's overall actions don't paint him as someone who would be too afraid to play the ""Just go ahead and kill me"" card for real.  Cicero's speech doesn't make sense because it doesn't make sense. There's no substance to it and that's reflected in its language. He doesn't have firm proof of anything, he doesn't have the senate behind him and he's too scared to abuse the emergency powers he has. So he delivers an extremely emotional & pompous speech to overwhelm any rational thinking. Some guys knocked on his door and he runs around telling everyone how he escaped death by a hair's breadth. A rational person would have him committed to a psych ward but he talks and talks and talks so fast you don't even notice his insanity (just read the speeches de lege agraria, exactly the same paranoia; seems that Cicero uncovered a massive conspiracy against the republic every other day during his consulate).   Catilina should have had that one in the bag."

For instance, if we were to take the Old Testament God as real, then we could reasonably say that he is fallax when he asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, but this does not show that he is ""phony"". I think it's much more appropriate to use inanis."

It will be easy at first, but by the end of the first book, they get you reading authentic Latin sentences, and in the second book, you get real passages of Latin authors.  2) When you've done that, read Eutropius. You'll need a dictionary, but his Latin is easy.  3) When you've done that, read the New Testament of the Vulgate.  4) Finally, after all this, you will be ready to read Caesar, then after Caesar, you should be able to handle Cicero and Livy and other tough prose authors.  Read prose first, because you will be able to develop your reading skills on it while the word order is still relatively normal, then you'll be ready to move onto poetry, where everything gets jumbled. If you want more practice, read laws and inscriptions, as they are easy if you can find out what the inscriptions mean.

So, partly because people already know many of stories, etc, it is a manageable text. Online Nova Vulgata here; Paperback here. [If you decide to use Vulgate for reading practice, beware of Stuttgart Vulgate. It is a beautiful edition, but it is per cola et commata; that means, among other things, no capitals or punctuation, which makes reading much more difficult.] Second, e-reader like Kindle. Kindle is a great resource for learning to read Latin. You can set the Kindle dictionary to a Latin-English dictionary & use it for help reading a Latin text. E.g., Compilatio de Catilina.

I know you don't think you are at the Aeneid's level of comprehension yet but, in case you want something different I would recommend this commentary of the Aeneid. It was designed with AP students in mind, so about second year college Latin.

latin,331gt5,translostation,2,Sat Apr 18 18:34:22 2015 UTC,Best suggestion: don't go directly to classical authors if you're working on your own. You're better off with lots of practice learning to read/process texts quickly - something you're likely not prepared to do after just two semesters in college. Give your time to comprehensible texts (e.g. The LLPSI texts or an older textbook like Pons Tironum) and it will pay dividends in the long term.

For self-study motivation is key and if motivation is broken once all the great future dividends become irrelevant as they'll never be realized.  OP should do whatever keeps him engaged. If that's the experience of mastery derived from fluently reading a Latin text that's obviously great. But if working on some big name author is what he needs to keep going then that's what he should be going for.   Even if he started working with the Aeneid right away he'd probably read Vergil pretty fluently by the time he is done with it, comprehensible input be damned."

latin,331fk2,Delirium-Trigger,4,Sat Apr 18 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"You may actually want someone that can translate it from German rather than English.  Going from the English you've given, depending on what ""capture"" means, you have some possibilities, e.g.:  Libertatem capiet (it will seize upon freedom)  Libertatem consequetur (it will obtain freedom)  Libertatem rapiet (it will lay hold of and carry off freedom)  In libertatem vindicabit (it will set free, but it sounds a little more forceful in Latin)"

""will er sich erbeuten"" is not a future tense but expresses a desire. Presumably the English translator chose the future tense for etymological considerations and its closeness to German ""er will"" (he wants) rather than its future meaning. In Latin the subjunctive would imo be too weak, better velle. ""erbeuten"" is ""capture"" in the meaning of ""to capture like prey and keep it"", i.e. capere or rapere. ""Beute"" in German is both loot (the spoils you haul away) and prey (as in: a prey animal).  The ""sich"" (dative of the 3rd person personal pronoun) is hard to translate into English (as ""for himself"" is probably too strong). Think of it like a Latin sibi or using the middle voice in Greek."

As /u/bitterlatinist broke it down, ""Freiheit will er sich erbeuten"" roughly translates to ""He wants to hunt down freedom for himself""   Libertatem sibi quaerit ad praedam   This captures the idea, although I feel that the Latin puts more emphasis on the wanting and not enough emphasis on the actual act of hunting (erbeuten). I'm also wondering about the ad.  I would change it to the following:  Libertatem uenari praedam sibi uult  This adds in the idea of actually hunting, as well as removing the ad and leaving the connection between libertatem and praedam to a direct apposition by case.

latin,32ufn3,bitterlatinist,5,Thu Apr 16 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"While it is grammatically correct except for the second sentence (/u/bitterlatinist is right, fix it), it is worded very awkwardly in a manner I have only seen in the works of people whose are not fluent in Latin and I think the meaning might be subverted by this. Here is what it literally says, including mistakes replicated using the closest English equivalents:  A master must be conquered by a demigod of the acceptance of inheritance of Russia who was troubled by the idea of a Titan so that he might interrupt his own crime. With the help of own four friends, corrections will is things going to be made by him.  The biggest problem with even the first sentence (I'm not sure you meant that kind of ""heritage""!) is that it sounds really straightforward and simple for a prophecy and it has that awkward wording where you order the subject and verb of both the main clause and the relative clause right next to each other; I think it sounds wrong because it's ordered almost the same as in English but I'm not sure what the real cause is. You also might not want to use words that are so specific (almost like they've been plucked out of a dictionary!) because a real prophecy often sounds more vague. Take this one, which Herodotus wrote was given to messengers from Athens by the Oracle of Delphi preceding the Persian Wars:   When the foe shall have taken whatever the limit of Cecrops Holds within it, and all which divine Cithaeron, shelters, Then far-seeing Jove grants this to the prayers of Athene; Safe shall the wooden wall continue for thee and thy children. Wait not the tramp of the horse, nor the footmen mightily moving Over the land, but turn your hack to the foe, and retire ye. Yet shall a day arrive when ye shall meet him in battle. Holy Salamis, thou shalt destroy the offspring of women, When men scatter the seed, or when they gather the harvest.    This is from Greek, not Latin, but you get the idea of how much figurative language is used in classical prophecies. It sounds weird to say things directly.  Additionally, you have used a sort of Roman square capitals, but mixed them with spaces and modern punctuation, which really looks odd to me. You might want to at least use interpuncts or change it to medieval or modern print, depending on the time period whence you intend its presented copy to originate. If this is a draft, though, all these things are fine and can be remedied with time."

This is why it's not a bad thing to have short English explanations for grammar and vocab.   Context does not tell you everything. Mistakes in interpretation happen and cases like this have ambiguity - who's to say they didn't try to put the roses into the water? Only if you already know that in + abl = ""in, on"" would you understand that the roses are just resting on the surface of the water. But if you were just vaguely sure, you start doubting what there rule really says if this context seems to suggest otherwise, and confusion and unnecessary vagueness results.  Orberg's Lingua Latina in this respect makes itself less forgiving, understandable and user-friendly to the self-study student by making them rely purely on context."

The abalative vs the accusative hass to do with the degree of submersion. Accusative meaning complete submersion and ablative meaning partial.

It's not good. Look on The Chronicle of Higher Education, and you'll see hand wringing about the sorry state of the job market every week. Part of the problem is the rise of adjunctification. You need to know what you're getting into.   2) Chances of getting into a good school will be a little lower due to the GPA. But, it's not impossible with good recommendations and high GRE scores. It sounds like the Grant will help you a lot. You also have plenty of time to correct it. Try to get above a 3.5.   3) Do not, whatever you do, PAY for a higher degree in the humanities. Some graduate programs will let you in but not give you funding. It's not worth it unless you're wealthy.   4) Advice: go to your profs' office hours. Work your ass off in Latin and Greek classes. You want to be near perfect in everything you do to impress the hell out of everybody. Start reading widely in criticism. Ask your profs for reading recs., then go talk to them. Start studying for the GRE now. The competition for good, funded programs is fierce.   5) Don't worry too much, and try to enjoy the great opportunity you have before you. Even if you don't go to graduate school, you'll always have the enjoyment that a classical education can bring you. Books are relatively cheap, after all.   Hope that helps."

I don't know if it was a factor in all the times I wasn't hired, but I suspect so.   However, I made an effort to spin my academic experiences as a positive. My teaching experience was a boon when I accepted a position teaching Java to new hires when I worked in the corporate world.

I miss teaching and I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.  I think that my experiences there have made me a better software developer.  If I didn't have 3 years standing in front of a classroom teaching non-majors Greek Civ or Latin, I wouldn't have the capacity to explain technical requirements to nontechnical stakeholders.

latin,32mn11,Foundinantiquity,8,Wed Apr 15 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"That seems very unlikely... I quote from Sihler's New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin, ""The origin of IE gender has always fascinated scholars, but most ideas on the question are necessarily very speculative.""  Also, the type of feminine morphology in Sanskrit appears to indicate that the feminine was derived from the masculine.  Full quote:   251. In nouns, overt (formal) indications of gender in PIE were few. For most form-classes, PIE masculine and feminine nouns inflected identically, and neuter differed from them only in the nominative and accusative cases. This is true also of i-stem adjectives (a common type) and interrogative/indefinite pronouns, though as a general rule adjectives and pronouns are more completely marked for gender than nouns are. Personal pronouns however have no gender in PIE and in most daughter languages.  There is one stem-class which is prevailingly masculine and neuter, the o-stems; and two which are prevailingly feminine, the eH2-stems (that is, ā-stems) and the *iH2/yeH2-stems (that is, ī/yā-stems; note a, below). In both Greek and Latin, but unique to them among IE groups, there are a fair number of feminine o-stems, not formally different from o-stem masculines in any way; and in Greek a new and productive type of masculine ᾱ-stems grew up, with distinctive forms for a few cases. The antiquity of these cross-gender types is disputed. Indic, for example, has no feminine a-stems (= the o-stems of Greek and Latin) or masculine ā-stems at all; and of the seven masculine nouns in -ī which occur in the RV, five are names. In any case, in all IE languages the reflexes of *eH2- and *yeH2-stem ADJECTIVES are purely feminine.  The paucity of distinctively feminine noun types, and the fact that all share the element *H2, make it appear that the feminine as a category is derivative, and not coeval with the masculine and neuter. The fact that Hittite lacks the feminine noun types (and feminine concord altogether) accords with this view, but other interpretations are possible. In any case, in the forms of speech underlying Greek and Latin and all IE languages apart from Anatolian, the three-gender system is well established in both concord and morphology. The origin of IE gender has always fascinated scholars, but most ideas on the question are necessarily very speculative.  a. The two distinctively feminine stems are commonly known as the senā type and the devī type, from the Sanskrit stock examples of inflection (Ved. senā- 'army' and devī- 'goddess'). Both types make feminine nouns more or less transparently derived from masculines. In Indo-Iranian, both types also build feminine stems to o-stem adjectives, whereas in the European IE languages only the senā type fills that office."
latin,32mn11,Grolser,-3,Wed Apr 15 05:13:31 2015 UTC,"well all my comparative grammars of any IE Languague says that it is more likely that the femininum is derived from the neutrum. There is no motive to start with a 3-Genussystem right away out of nowhere. If he can prove so, i am the last who wouldnt change his mind."
latin,32mn11,Foundinantiquity,7,Wed Apr 15 11:47:16 2015 UTC,"Are your grammars making the argument that because Greek and Latin neuter plurals end in -a, and Latin feminine singular ends in -a, the feminine form originated from neuter plural then became transformed into feminine singular?  Why doesn't the neuter plural resemble the feminine singular in any other case than the nominative?    Case Feminine singular Neuter plural (o-stem)    nom puella templa   voc puella templa   acc puellam templa   gen puellae templorum   dat puellae templis   abl puellā templis    If the feminine was derived from the neuter plural, but only the nominative case supported that theory, then the origin of the feminine must have predated the origin of the case system.  But Hittite has no feminine gender, only the other two. But it has seven cases in its case system. This seems to suggest that the case system is older than the change from the two-gender system to a three-gender system.  So it seems unlikely that the feminine singular would be derived from neuter plural, but that all its cases other than the nominative don't suggest any forms that look neuter plural."
latin,32mn11,Grolser,-5,Thu Apr 16 02:06:39 2015 UTC,its not only latin and greek. All languagues with 3 Genera have this phenomenon. Its another plural of neuter words its not the actual plural of neuters.
latin,32mn11,Foundinantiquity,4,Thu Apr 16 02:21:00 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you mean by ""Its another plural of neuter words its not the actual plural of neuters.""? Is the feminine derived from the neuter plural? If it is, then there should be word forms that suggest it. Did your grammars provide any examples of this phenomenon?"
latin,32mn11,MPORCATO,-4,Thu Apr 16 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"sure i can give you an example: german ""Das Blatt"" leaf, ""Die Blätter"" leaves (plural), ""Das Geblätt""=""Das Laub"" foliage (collective plural)"
latin,32mn11,Grolser,3,Thu Apr 16 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"Abstract concepts are often represented by feminine nouns. For example, multitudo can mean a ""greatness of number"", but also a crowd of people (=multi homines, masc plur.).  iuventus can mean ""youth"" in the sense of the period of youth, but also ""the youth"", i.e. all of the young men (=iuvenes, masc. plur). But from these examples, we would not conclude that because a particular class of feminine nouns - abstract nouns - can have a collective sense, and that this is equivalent in sense to the plural of some masculine words, that the feminine was derived from the masculine plural. Or indeed specifically the neuter plural, if the same can be shown with masculine words. I think it still remains very speculative."
latin,32mn11,MPORCATO,3,Fri Apr 17 01:03:00 2015 UTC,"For a start, cite ""all your comparative grammars"" so that others can find them. Until you do so, and this comes with no personal offence to you, I think it would be prudent for a reader to treat anything you say as misinformation.  (I would note also not all feminine nouns in IE languages are a-stem. Edit: I noted originally that not all a-stem nouns are feminine either, but reading Sihler more closely reveals that ""the antiquity of these cross-gender types is disputed"". The overall point remains valid, though.)  Edit iterum: See post below for update."
latin,32mn11,Grolser,-4,Thu Apr 16 05:50:05 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand how IE Studies work, thats your problem. The first feminine were a-stemms, that derived from the declension of neuter words, obviously the genussystem has changed, but the initial thought of feminine is the collective plural of object words and its not gender equality"
latin,32mn11,MPORCATO,6,Thu Apr 16 06:01:50 2015 UTC,"Repeating yourself is not proof.  Cite the comparative grammar books you are relying on.  At least according to Sihler (cited above by /u/Foundinantiquity), there are two types of feminine stems reconstructed, eH₂- and *iH₂/yeH₂- (the senā type and the devī type). I'd really like to know where you got the impression that ""the first feminine were a-stems"", but there's nothing I can do about that until you actually tell us which comparative grammar books you've been reading.  Edit: Still not sure what your comparative grammar books say, but I investigated this issue further, and Sihler paragraph 262 does suggest that the eH₂- stem feminine singulars could be derived from neuter plurals with evidence such as the fact that Hittite neuter plurals take singular verbs, like Greek, so I can see this could be where you are coming from. Nevertheless, he doesn't appear to endorse the formation of the entire feminine gender from n.pl.nom. of the PIE o-stem (""...the evolution of a whole new stem type and concord class ('feminine') from a single form is not easy to trace in detail""), and there is still the issue of *iH₂/yeH₂- stem nouns, so I think what you are saying does seem plausible, but probably shouldn't be passed on to everyone as a matter of simple fact."
latin,32mn11,Grolser,-4,Thu Apr 16 06:09:40 2015 UTC,"the german(ic) genussystem would be completly different, if the first feminine weren't a-stems from neuter words. You can look up all the comparative grammars of germanic languages. If there were a-stems before, they were not feminine until the feminine was ""invented"", these stems were reinterpreted."
latin,32mn11,NotMeTonight,7,Thu Apr 16 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"I will admit that I don't know much about Germanic historical linguistics, but I was under the impression that proto-Germanic comes from a late form of PIE that already had 3 genders. Again, I'd love to see the scholarly work on this, if you could care to show me any.  Plus, one does need to note that the reinterpretation of neuter plurals as feminines can happen way after the actual origin of the feminine gender. opera, for instance, is a Latin neuter plural that became a feminine singular in Italian (likewise foglia < folia), but this does not prove that the feminine gender in Italian is itself invented based on the neuter plural."
latin,32mn11,Grolser,-2,Thu Apr 16 09:08:55 2015 UTC,"the system is not productive anymore beause the three genders are already there and reinterpretation is not very likely to happen, since new words will get the new interpretation right away."

latin,32mgxk,hectic33,5,Tue Apr 14 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"It's hard to help without knowing what you do and don't know, but these are the basics. If anyone better at this than me sees a mistake, please correct it.  Identifying declension is usually easy. Speaking generally, a noun in the nominative case is first declension if it ends with -a, second declension if it ends with -us, -um, or -r, and third declension if it ends in anything else. This isn't true in all cases, but it should cover most of what you see in Latin I.  Once you identify a noun's declension (which you can do in seconds with wiktionary if all else fails), declining the noun is as simple as taking the noun stem and adding to it the desired case ending, which in this case would be the proper ablative or accusative ending.  For 1st Declension (nominative singular ends with -a):    ablative singular: -ā; ablative plural: -īs accusative singular: -am; accusative plural: -ās   For 2nd Declension (nominative singular ends in -us, -um, or -r)   ablative singular: -ō; ablative plural: -īs accusative singular: -um; accusative plural: -ōs (or -a if neuter)   For 3rd Declension (e.g. fortis, tristes, ingentes, etc.)   ablative singular: -e (most nouns), -ī (adjectives); ablative plural: -ibus accusative singular: -em (unless neuter); accusative plural: -ēs (unless neuter)"
latin,32mgxk,dekatriath,3,Wed Apr 15 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the genitive can, in general, be used to determine declension: 1st Declension has its genitive form ending in -ae, 2nd in -ī, 3rd in -is, 4th in -ūs, and 5th in -eī. Using the genitive for this also helps because you can use it to easily find the stem of the noun by dropping the case ending."
latin,32mgxk,Kowber,5,Wed Apr 15 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, genitive is a good way to determine the declension. OP's listed forms are nominative, though, so going from the nominative is likely more useful in this case."

Autocinetum I'd also accept (that's just Greek) but autoraeda makes me cringe because of its awful mix of Greek and Latin. Something along the lines of ""raeda automata"", ""raeda per se ipsam mota"", ... would quickly get too unwieldy to use in actual speech.  For computer I'd use computator (found in Seneca, really refers to a person that does calculations but until a few decades ago the English word did so, too). The frequently used computatorium is to be rejected as by its formation it would suggest a building/place (scriptorium, oratorium, auditorium, ...).

I feel like I haven't seen oblivisci used with actions that were supposed to be undertaken that have been forgotten. I'm not saying that it can't be used that way, it just is not in my mind as something that seems familiar.

Substantives are adjectives used without modifying an explicit noun.  They usually are understood as having an implied object.  First, in English, we only use absolute substantive adjectives in the plural: ""the strong receive the prizes"" but never *""the strong wins the race"".  (Superlative substantives can show up in the singular: ""Which piece of bacon do you want?  The crispiest.""  In Latin, there's no such silly limitations on number.  Latin also does not distinguish between definite and indefinite (""a"" vs. ""the"").  Latin also, helpfully, has gender on its adjectives, so substantives can come in a number of helpful flavors: iustus means ""a fair (man),"" sancta means ""a/the holy (woman)"" or ""a/the (female) saint.""  So what you're looking for is an adjective.  I'd translate your excerpt something like:  faciunt fortiores quid possint, patiuntur fessi quo sit opus.

latin,32dqzb,misternumberone,2,Sun Apr 12 23:54:47 2015 UTC,Wheelock's is doubtlessly a very good and complete basic Classical Latin grammar textbook that covers everything except the more unusual poetic things and some really advanced stuff (iirc mood of verbs within relative clauses within indirect statement is one) and the super unusual verbs. The only complaint some people have about Wheelock's is that they consider it rather dense and stuffy and think Latin is more easily and effectively learned by a natural method than by memorizing rules and tables out of a textbook.
latin,32dqzb,thrasumachos,6,Mon Apr 13 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is to look at Wheelock's and Lingua Latina--Wheelock's is the best grammar reference out there that's not a pure grammar book, and Lingua Latina is great for actual language acquisition. Read both, and you're in very good shape.  Also, of those, I'd say go with LL first, then use Wheelock's to explain what you learned through LL."

On 3 - I think this is not a good idea, to have a quality assurance team that manually marks comments.

latin,327rpv,bitterlatinist,10,Sat Apr 11 09:10:12 2015 UTC,"Given your user name and flair I find this a little humorous.   Yes, there is a huge problem in the Latinate world because of a lack of native speakers. But this actually can't be solved. I mean, you can theoretically generate native speakers, but the socio-demographic requirements to turn Latin into a self-sustaining linguistic community with native speakers are just enormous, precisely because there is no impetus to create such a community of native speakers, and even if you did, it's likely that Latin would continue to evolve.  Creating a smaller community of competent L2 speakers is much more achievable, but given how few competent to fluent Latin speakers there are, and the much lower percentage of them who are likely to ever pop their heads into this subreddit, I don't know what you're honestly expecting to happen.  What this subreddit does have are some clearly well educated and well read Latinists. You can easily spot them if you know more than nothing on the subject, and if you're here for long enough, their answers speak for themselves.  Teaching people to be critical of answers is itself a critical skill, but I'm not entirely convinced it's a problem solvable in a subreddit. Likewise, I think the quality of advice on this subreddit is actually often quite high. It varies, like any subreddit."
latin,327rpv,EcceVulpes,2,Sat Apr 11 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"I don't care for native speakers.   Most activity on this sub is generated by people who know no or barely any Latin asking for translations. They can't judge the answer they receive on its own merits, they haven't been here long enough to know the various users and the flairs would be useless even if they were verified in some way (a degree in Latin/Classics doesn't guarantee any language competency beyond the ability to translate from Latin).  At present I'm not convinced by the ability of this sub to produce reliable results (e.g. a few days ago I wrote ""toto"" for a dative, I only noticed the next day and of course nobody had remarked on it). In my opinion we either need to cultivate a mindset that is much more eager to correct and be corrected (the ""Grex Latine Loquentium"" mailing list is a good example for that kind of culture but I understand that it can be seen as off-putting) or we need to make it clear that one can't rely on the quality of answers here the way one can when asking in other language-related subreddits."

That they constitute most of the activity, and tend to drown out anything that might be of interest to the community, may well be one of the reasons why we don't have many competent speakers here.  That they can't judge the answers particularly well, too, seems a bit pointless as a concern as I doubt they care. For the most part, they're making no-effort posts asking for literal translations of idiomatic English so that they can write it in a book, or get a tattoo, or put it on a plaque, or something similar. Even correct literal translations will largely be nonsensical. If they have no interest in the language, and will never make any effort to know whether the translation makes any sense, does it particularly matter whether the quality of responses is high?

I don't know how helpful this would be to someone with no knowledge of Latin, but it might help someone with a mediocre knowledge of Latin. It might get rather tedious, however. Maybe there could be some version of this along the lines of a friendly understanding that if someone asks (nicely) about why it's acceptable to say such-and-such, that an appropriate response would be to ""prove"" the merit of what you've said by a citation from some reputable author.  Or, perhaps the whole situation would be helped if people were more forthcoming about their own estimation of what they've written. People sometimes do this, e.g., indicate if they're not sure about something but are simply throwing it out there. Maybe we need some kind of parallel voting system. But, even then, if those who are voting are not qualified to judge, then how can the votes be held reliable?   How can we get querents to be properly critical of our answers when they don't understand a word of what we tell them?   I'll also add as a related note that when people (not regulars here) come in and ask for a translation, I personally don't like being second-guessed by Google Translate. It happens, though, and there's no convincing them otherwise.  I think of it along the lines of Plato's analogy of the cave. Someone who doesn't know Latin cannot see the merit or demerit of a Latin text and they have only the authority of others to go on, others who have not established their own credibility in any way and, indeed, seem unable to do so for the most part."

That way it would be expected that when you screwed something up, someone would point it out for you.   Anyone who has ever learned a new language (or remembers their first) gets corrected a bajillion times even at an intermediate level. That's just how it goes. I personally expect to be corrected because there's nothing a Latinist loves more than to point out someone else's error and how else would I be mindful of my mistakes?

I mean, if all you're doing is preparing gourmet meals for someone that would just as soon eat trash, then after awhile, doesn't it seem natural that your desire to improve will wane?  I'm not saying that trying to improve at Latin is something any of us does only to win the praise of others, but a language is a means of communication, and it's much easier to try to get better in the context of a community with a good-natured desire for excellence. To use another example, after awhile it gets old telling jokes when no one laughs.

latin,326l4n,vossbot,3,Sat Apr 11 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"Conditionals within indirect statement is a tricky topic, a very thorough discussion of which is held within Bradley's Arnold ch. LIX (specifically 472).   The best way to tackle this is to create the original conditional in oratio recta first, and proceed to translate into oratio obliqua. (I'm assuming the original clause is an unreal conditional with two pluperfect subjunctives.)     Vir optimus fuisset, si adfuisset.   Thus in oratio obliqua you would use the future participle and fuisse to express some sort of conditional and also an infinitive at the same time, so:     Dicit se virum optimum futurum fuisse, si adfuisset.     note that the protasis subjunctive remains unchanged, so dicit can change to dixit and nothing would change.  This is also true for two imperfect subjunctives:   vir optimus esset, si adesset     becomes     dicit/dixit virum optimum futurum fuisse, si adesset."
latin,326l4n,Onomacritus,3,Sat Apr 11 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"In the example you give: Dicit se virum optimum futurum fuisse, si quid factum esset [He says he would have been the best man, if something had been done.]"

latin,326l4n,EcceVulpes,4,Sat Apr 11 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"Infinitives don't really have mood strictly speaking. Your instinct is totally normal, though. We (like the Romans) naturally think of futurity and unreality and things governed by the subjunctive as closely related. It gets weird in indirect discourse (especially in the constructions where fore ut is needed), but there is a logic to it.  In the original example: He says that he had been going to be the best man, if something were going to be having been done.

latin,326qy0,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,2,Sat Apr 11 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"Sine sacrificio victoria esse nequit is literally ""without sacrifice there cannot be victory.""   That's a very Roman thing to say but probably not what OP intended. Sacrificium is completely the wrong word, you need something like iactura.   Victoria sacrificio eget is ""victory needs sacrifice.""   Egere is to really need something and not have it. It's a different (more needy) kind of ""need"" than what you are looking for. ""Victoria sacrificio eget"" is ""The goddess Victoria is without the sacrifice that she needs."""

I'd like to apologize for spreading a bad translation. I was wrong, and I should have been more discerning when speaking on a subject in which I am not an expert.   I have two questions about your notes on my translations. How do you glean the differences between words like sacrificium & iactura or egeo & other synonyms? Also, what makes you translate ""victoria"" in the second sentence as ""the goddess Victoria"" rather than just ""victory""?"
latin,326qy0,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,2,Sat Apr 11 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"How do you glean the differences between words like sacrificium & iactura or egeo & other synonyms?    On the one hand there are general dictionaries (which are usually sufficient), on the other hand there are specialized works on synonyms.  Good dictionaries try to make the differences between words clear. I don't know anything about English-Latin dictionaries but here's the entry for ""sacrifice"" in a German-Latin dictionary: link As you can see it doesn't just give you two or three Latin words, it gives you many of them and explanations for each and every one. The entry is structured as follows: I concerns the literary use of ""sacrifice"", II concerns figurative use, IIa is about humans that are sacrificed/sacrifice themselves, IIb about things. As expected sacrificium is found in I and iactura in IIb, the explanation to iactura reads ""sacrifice of money etc. for various purposes"" (which is not very elucidating but at least something).  But no matter how good or bad your English-Latin dictionary is, you should always double-check with a Latin-English dictionary, too. Ideally this would be the Oxford Latin Dictionary but that's expensive and not available online, so the older Lewis & Short will do (it's not very reliable for vowel lengths but otherwise ok): sacrificium and iactura. Not only does this get you additional English explanations (you see that sacrificium doesn't have any remarks on figurative use; ""a sacrifice, outlay, expense, cost"" for iactura is just what we want) but also examples from Latin authors. These examples give you an idea of how the word can be used in locutions and also allow you to convince yourself that the dictionary author is not just making things up (look the places up in context & decide whether the word really means what the dictionary wants it to mean1).  Now on to specialized literature on synonyms. The Academia Vivarium Novum has a great bibliography (with Google Books or archive.org links for most books) on this topic at: https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/sinonimi  The Gradus ad Parnassum are not what you are looking for right now but you should be aware of them. If you should ever need to discover close synonyms (maybe one day you'll fancy yourself a Latin poet and spend hours upon hours searching for words that match your meter) you'll be grateful for their existence.  You are looking for the differences between words and that's what books like the ones by Döderlein and Dumesnil (to name the two with English translations) cover. E.g. egere (Döderlein) & egere (Dumesnil).   Also, what makes you translate ""victoria"" in the second sentence as ""the goddess Victoria"" rather than just ""victory""?   Because egere is something that persons do.  1: This can be a better idea than you'd think as the dictionaries have been copying each other extensively, often without actually checking the places they refer to. The OLD is a big deal because its references were actually checked when creating it. Lewis & Short on the other hand (according to Wikipedia):   It was derived from the 1850 English translation by Ethan Allen Andrews of an earlier Latin-German dictionary, Wörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache, by the German philologist Wilhelm Freund, in turn based on I.J.G. Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary of 1783. The Andrews translation was partially revised by Freund himself, then by Henry Drisler, and was finally edited by Short and Lewis.   So an edit of a revision of a revision of an English translation of a Latin-German dictionary which in turn is based on Scheller's dictionary (the first ""modern"" Latin-German dictionary). And just because Wikipedia breaks off doesn't mean that we've reached the end of the line - Scheller's dictionary was heavily based on Forcellini's Latin-Latin dictionary which certainly didn't appear out of thin air either.   You can't copy & translate, shorten & amend dictionary entries so many times without mistakes creeping in. And sometimes the prevailing views have just changed. Thanks to the internet you might find that the locution broadly attributed to ""Cic."" in your dictionary is actually found in the Rhetorica ad Herennium (which nobody believes to be written by Cicero anymore; but in the 18th century people were more willing to just roll with traditional authorship information even if it was very dubious - and then just everyone kept copying each other; To be fair the problem ""Some dude a hundred years ago said that this combination of three words is found somewhere in the corpus of Cicero but he didn't say where."" was seriously hard to solve before the advent of computers. You'd need an already existing concordance or you'd have to be extremely well-read and gifted with an excellent memory.)."

latin,322heu,DeepSouthShitlord,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. As a demonstrative pronoun ille is a little more removed that is or hic (more like ""that"" than ""this"") and it often refers to something that has been mentioned before.   E.g. if you spoke about a knight in the previous sentence than ""ille miles"" would simply refer to him.

latin,31zvwe,Gidonka,6,Thu Apr 9 13:38:23 2015 UTC,"Your Latin translation of that English rendering of the original Greek has some problems. Most of those words mean more or less what you want them to, at least as isolated dictionary entries, but you've got some incorrect and ungrammatical formations, and I'm not quite sure that Latin idiom would say ""Iron has the power to pull a man to ruin"" with those word-for-word equivalents, even with correct forms.  If you took what you read in English and translated it, I think Latin would prefer to use a form of posse + infinitive rather than the noun potestas and a form of habere (which, even if you did use, would not be 2nd person singular as you have it unless the author is addressing iron in apostrophe). Your infinitive we can keep, but I think you might prefer the compound attrahere instead of the related but semantically shaded tractare. virum is probably fine as you have it, but ad always takes the accusative, so ad exitium (a phrase which shows up frequently in Latin, actually). That would leave us with something more along the lines of:   Ferrum virum attrahere ad exitium potest   That would be at least a better and more grammatical translation of the English."

latin,31zvwe,merelyfreshmen,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:11:59 2015 UTC,Do we have any means of comparing which Latin words are the best equivalents of Greek ones?
latin,31zvwe,ReedsAndSerpents,4,Fri Apr 10 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well the words are right for the most part OP but your endings are all over the place. The only one that fits is ferrum.   At the moment your sentence reads:   Ferrum = the iron/iron (n./acc.) potestatis = of the power/ability (sg. gen.) tractare = to pull, drag (inf. verb) virum = the man (sg. acc) ad = to (governs accusative) exitio = by/with/for/concerning the ruin (sg. abl.) habes = you have   So ""iron of the power to pull the man by the ruin/collapse you have"". It would actually make a little more sense if you were talking to iron in this case: ""Iron, you have to the man of power to pull by ruin"". Do you see the importance of the correct stem endings and how they affect meaning?  We can go about changing this a few different ways. One is using /u/writermonk's provided quote, ""the very sight of iron (weapons) draws men on (tempts men to use them"". We can rearrange your sentence or come up with a completely new one. Let's try fixing your sentence up a little bit.   Firstly, let's just make the simple sentence ""Iron has the power"". Like I said, your words weren't horribly off, just the grammar. ""Ferrum postestatem habet"". If I were to go farther then this I would immediately change from habere - ""to have"" to posse - ""to be able to"". If you had your heart set on iron possessing the power and not just being able then we can use a handy little pronoun called qui. Try this:  ""Ferrum potestatem [quae virum trahit] habet.""  Now we have ""Iron the power [which drags a man] has.""  To finally complete the thought of ""to ruin"" we need ""ad exitium"" in the accusative, not the ablative because ad. We can put that in the description of the power that iron possesses (our quae addition) and still use the idea of tractare to be ""quae virum ad exitium trahit"".  ""Ferrum potestatem habet quae virum ad exitium trahit.""  Not exactly how I'd say it but it preserves most of what you were trying to say. The original thought is much simpler; the iron draws men.    Edit: antecedent + position in clause = quae"

E.g. Bennett invokes ""natus eo patre quo dixi"" (translating ""born of the father that I said"") as an example of a relative pronoun being attracted to its antecedent (adapted from Nepos' Epaminondas biography) but others read such cases as an ellipsis: ""natus eo patre quo [eum natum esse] dixi"" (which makes much more sense to me). But can really every single case be explained as an ellipsis? turns out there are gray areas and the further you progress in time the more Greek influence was at work and pretty soon we're debating about completely irrelevant edge cases - when all anyone needs to know is ""Don't do this"". But if I write ""This is not done in Latin, here's how Latin works:"" then chances are I get to have the entire stupid discussion because on the internet technically right counts for the best kind of right.  ... and that's enough bitterness for now."

The English is a bit embellished; the Greek says something rather simpler: ""For iron itself attracts men [to war/death/conflict implied],"" the suggestion being that the very sight of iron tempts men to use it (to their own destruction).  As for Latin translations, we have parts of one Latin Odusia, by Livius Andronicus, from the 3rd c. BCE. It's actually among our earliest literary documents in Latin, but it's quite fragmented, and its full extent is unknown (translation of the whole text? Just a few choice passages? Use as a classroom text?). I'm fairly certain that this line is not among the extant fragments, but I'll have a look and see if I'm wrong.  Edit: Didn't see 16.294 among the extant fragments, sadly.

You don't really need mare, since altum is used to talk about the sea in the same way that we use the phrase ""in the deep""  but there's no harm in keeping it.  If you use various online services to translate it, you might be worried to see that altus means high; but it means both.  The Romans apparently conceived of vertical distance without thinking about whether it was below you or above you.  So a high mountain is altus mons, but a deep sea is altum maris: the adjective used is the same.  If you get rid of mare, alto becomes a noun meaning ""the deep"" regularly used in good poetic latin to mean ""the sea.""  If you keep mare, alto is an adjective and together the phrase ""in alto mare,"" just means, ""in the deep sea.""  The version I gave above would be pronounced ""nisin alto mare, non merdas,"" because of the rules of elision."

Some good poets use the ablative ""mare"" but I'd very much prefer ""mari"". When the genitive plural ends in -ium, the ablative is often -i (but there are exceptions, ""mixed i-stems"", e.g. nox, that have adopted an ablative in -e). Some nouns don't know whether they want to be mixed or not, in those cases I'd prefer the most common form (e.g. outside of fixed locutions such as ""ferro ignique"" I'd say ""igne"", I'd always say ""mari"")."

latin,31sg3x,bitterlatinist,3,Tue Apr 7 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"I can! Though I'll really be saying about the same thing as /u/translostation. Almost no one has much of a background in spoken Latin, so if you're worried you'll be behind, don't be. The best advice I can give you is to study vocabulary as much as you can before you leave. That'll make the sub arboribus sessions so much more fun.  The teachers are completely fabulous (though, yes, I am biased here).  They're really calm and encouraging, and they'll be available outside of class for extra spoken Latin if that's what you want. The amount you do really depends on how invested you are. LLiR isn't a traditional immersion course.   There is not a massive amount of ludi domestici-- the teachers really want you to have time to enjoy Rome while you're there. It will be challenging, but hopefully never overwhelmingly so.  It's awesome that you know Rome well! That can only help your experience. Yes, the bulk of the students are American, and from schools on the east coast, but that's really only because our sphere of influence is strongest there at the moment. As /u/translostation already said, some of our staff come from Ivy League schools.  Hope that helps! Can I ask: Why does it worry you that there is only one other European student this year?"
latin,31sg3x,bombastandaplomb,4,Wed Apr 8 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"I did a guest presentation with them for one of their sub arboribus sessions last summer. The average incoming student has had little to no (at best, very limited) background in spoken Latin so I wouldn't worry too much about that part. They're extremely nice people and quite accommodating in terms of taking beginners and helping to ease them into the process. My experiences with Paideia suggest that a large number of their students do come from the Ivy League (mostly because that's where their base of employees and volunteers comes from), but ""member institutions"" are just those that contribute to be associated with Paideia itself, so it's not strictly limited to Ivies - e.g. NYU is a member iirc. You'll also find students and individuals from a variety of personal and intellectual backgrounds, so you should find the whole environment quite friendly. Depending on the goals you've set yourself for the summer, I'd likely recommend the experience."

Right again on copiae.  singular: bounty, plenty, supplies, etc.  plural also means ""forces"" or ""troops."" The subject definitely can be copiae if you read it as a feminine nominative plural.  It makes sense to me that way, but you should always double check: Does it make sense grammatically (does continebantur agree with copiae in person and number)?  Does it make sense semantically? (possunt copiae ignibus contineri?)  Does it make sense in context?  (does copiae continebantur make sense next to caesar a manu Gallorum prohibitus erat?)

First off red was the symbol of military power and as Caesar was a general he would wear an all red robe to symbolize as much.  Second purple was also tied into being symbolic of royalty.  While it is true that senators would wear robes that were trimmed with purple, wearing an all purple robe would have been seen as lifting yourself up to the equivalent of king.  In fact when he was dictator for life Julius Caesar apperantly wore a robe that had a bit too much purple in it, which evidently helped convince more of the senators to join the scheme to kill him.

I imagine a redditor facing him in debate would just go ""ad hominem, ad hominem, ad hominem, satanas abage, lalala I can't hear you"" and expect to convince the audience??? Learning how to employ the fallacies, how to pierce them without looking like a pedantic ass and how to come back from being accused of their use certainly seems like a profitable use of one's time."
latin,31mgk3,EcceVulpes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't intend any of the following to apply to OP, whose intentions, etc. I don't know.  All I'm trying to say in this sort of case is that, if you're interested in informal fallacies (presumably so that you can avoid them in rational argumentation, and I would wish to distinguish rhetorical style carefully from fallacious argumentation), then rather than coining impressive-sounding Latin retorts, it's probably better to learn about the many, already-named informal fallacies.  As a parallel sort of example, a law student would do better to learn the Latin terms of art in their field rather than to attempt coining new Latin phrases for the sake of sounding intelligent.  Regarding rhetoric, I think people of most past ages had a much higher tolerance for hyperbole and certain oratorical flourishes and that it was probably expected that when debating with someone or writing against someone you would lay it on thick in certain places. For example, pretty much any of the writings of the Patristic era ""against"" someone, or even the letters between Jerome and Augustine (though Augustine is pretty kind to Jerome throughout). Or, Thomas More's writings against Luther, or, for that matter, many of Luther's writings, are also pretty vitriolic by today's standards. Maybe people were just tougher back then. Or, maybe they took things less literalistically."

latin,31mgk3,Numeromancer,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"The reason why Tu quoque is a fallacy is that whether the person making the argument is guilty of hypocrisy doesn't (typically) bear on the soundness of their argument.

In another more famous ancient example, during Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem a crowd of followers waved palm branches as a symbol of victory (the custom of carrying palm leaves to commemorate the triumphal entry is repeated in some traditional churches as Palm Sunday).

All languages are ambiguous. They depend on a consensus regarding fuzzy meanings (both vocabulary and grammar) that can be applied literally, tropically, etc. Even in a language that you know fluently, there will always be ambiguity. In fact, ambiguity itself can be a very effective way to convey meaning. However, when learning a new language, you will probably find things ambiguous that a fluent speaker will not, since their mind is used to filtering out the grammatically possible but highly improbable meanings.  For example, the following dialogue paraphrased from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:  ""It's going to feel unpleasant, sort of like being drunk.""  ""What's so unpleasant about being drunk?""  ""You ask a glass of water!"""

Monks gathered 7 times a day to sing the psalms. An antiphon is a verse prayer added to a psalm.  So here “Psalm” gives the first word of the psalm to be sung which will be followed by the antiphon.  The first 4 words at the top of the page are the end of an antiphon that goes:  O crux benedicta, quae sola fuisti digna portare talentum mundi: dulce lignum, dulces clavos, dulcia ferens pondera: super omnia ligna cedrorum, tu sola excelsior: in qua mundi salus pependit, in qua Christus triumphavit, et mors mortem superavit in aeternum.  O holy cross, which alone was worthy to bear the worth of the world: sweet wood, wood, sweet nails bearing sweet weight:  you only are higher than all the wood of Cedar, on which hung the salvation of the world, in which Christ triumphed and, through death, overcame death forever.  Next are antiphons for the feast.  I’ve used a / to indicate line breaks in your manuscript page. The words “psalm” and “antiphon” (abbreviated as “ana”) are rubricated, i.e., written in red. Medieval writers highly abbreviated words to save space, much like our texting. Thus, ""dns"" = ""dominus"" or lord. I've expanded all the abbreviated words in my transcription.  [mor]tem superavit in aeternum. Psalmus: Cantus  Ad laudem Antiphona  O Magnum pietatis  opus mors: mort-  ua tunc est in lingo quan-  do mortua vita fuit. Psalmus: Dominus.

Its very insanity highlights the gap between something written in Latin and a translation of an existing work into Latin. More often than not the latter is just a thin coat of Latin over English ideas & sentence structures (""Literal transposition, in prose or verse, from English into Latin will not result in Latin. 'I could not care less, Caesar, whether you approve of me or not' - non minus curare possim utrum me probes necne will not do."", Schnur).  Literary prose becomes exceedingly rare after the 18th century, poetry managed to hang in a bit longer. To my knowledge Giovanni Pascoli was the last great Latin poet (if nothing else you should know his take on Iugurtha).

It seems like ecclesiastical latin is its own thing, which is cool but assuming you're interested in language qua language (e.g. people who care enough to participate in latin online) you'd probably want to learn classical latin.  I should clarify that I don't hate ecclesiastical latin nor am I particularly against religious people learning latin. There's a quote I can't find ATM, but Aquinas said something to the effect of ""I don't care if barbarians take over Rome, as long as they're christians"". It makes sense from a christian point of view, since why would you care what language people speak so long as they accept god or whatever, but again, from the perspective of someone who doesnt speak latin, and is going to invest hundreds and hundreds of hours of their life into learning a dead language, you'd probably be attached to romantic notions of the language itself, and want to learn a version which is less corrupted.

Plus, text wise, ecclesiastical is much simpler and less interesting. For me now the music, and the religious sentiments within the texts, are about as valuable to me as learning about Rome and stuff, although the latter is often more exciting because there's more than I don't know or have never been exposed to.  I am religious, attended Catholic school briefly, and have become more interested in Catholicism than before I started Latin, but I would attribute that to the general trend of my becoming more interested in 'old' things in general. But yeah, that, and probably the influence of religion are why I ended up here. Religion isn't at all why I've stayed though."

While I generally agree with Christian ethics, the dogma of Catholic Church often is too conservative for me and I can't really identify myself with it.

And I often am sceptical that maybe I would have become Atheist out of my own beliefs, if I were not raised as a Catholic Christian. But I will never find out and as I said, I do believe in God.  My love for Latin, however, has nothing to do with my religion, I've just been extremely interested in Ancient Romans and Greeks since the age of 10 or something. This is where my love for Latin roots back to."

The main issue I recognize is the one put most succinctly by Emperor Julian in his rescript on teachers, but that's a difficulty religious and atheist teachers face alike. Maybe there are some teachers who desire nothing beyond teaching their students how to translate and contextualize a given text. But there is a long tradition of an education in classics being more than just that (look at Quintilian) and any approach that wants to be more makes it necessary to actually teach the authors rather than to content yourself with teaching about the authors. To what degree a Christian or an atheist of the 21st century can become Homer to his students, is indeed highly questionable. Copious amounts of hypocrisy are going to be involved. However, the option Julian tried to go for (regardless of his ulterior motives, it is the intellectually honest choice) does no longer exist for us and so we are left with the question of whether we do greater injustice to the classics by misrepresenting them or by treating them as lifeless objects of intellectual dissection.  In this spirit your accusation of insufficient objectivity feels almost like a compliment - nevertheless I'd be interested in learning what kind of problems you had in mind when writing your post."

Actually, I consider philology to be intellectual dissection of a textual corpus.  You don't need to tell your students 'the gods are real, and if you object, leave my class' like some teachers do. You can simply teach the Roman belief system - from a distance and as a historical mindset which may or may not be true. Not only does this suffice to understand the text in its historical context, it also allows the student to compare the textual models of e.g. physics to any other models described in literature (say, Cicero vs. Lucretius), without the bias of one of them dogmatically having to be true."

Because heaven forbid you don't keep the text at arm's length to maintain your precious distance! Imagine the horrors if you actually took a text seriously in its own ambition rather than reduce it to an object on which to demonstrate the sterile brilliance of your intellect! You might accidentally become a better person.  What's the point of dealing in literature & rhetoric if not to become a better human?  edit: Maybe not the greatest comparison but on some level philology is like performing a piece of sacred music in a concert hall.

There is plenty of demand for good Latin teachers, with or without a Master's degree. Just look at the job listings on the ACL—keep in mind that this is before teachers have even announced that they are leaving, for the most part, so any jobs listed here indicate a shortage. I and none of my Latin teacher friends have ever had trouble finding a job, and although Latin is shrinking in certain places, it's growing in others. My school is hiring two new Latin teachers next year, one to replace my colleague, who is moving to another city, and another to keep up with growing enrollment.  Most schools that teach Latin are public schools, not private. Pay depends on where you live. I used to teach in NC, where they are completely fucking public education, and the pay was low. Now I teach in Texas, and make over $50,000, which is fine for the cost of living here. Having a quarter of the year off is nice, too, although you definitely more than make up for it while school is in session.  Teaching's not for everybody, and it's not just a job, or a career—it's a lifestyle. But for those who can live with the downsides, it's very fulfilling, because it's very meaningful work, which in my experience is something that kids in high school and college don't think enough about when they're figuring out what they want to do.

latin,31dd7g,infinitum17,3,Sat Apr 4 05:56:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on the region of the country. In some places public schools have gotten rid of Latin. In others, it's thriving.  With regard to your question...that's a great question. I don't even know.

But if you want a good job teaching Latin, getting an MA is probably a good idea.

latin,31cu5z,Daredhevil,6,Mon Apr 6 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"As many pointed out in classical Latin it should be like ""eye"". There are a lot more things which are taught in a different way at school and it also is pretty dependent on your language (because, if some Latin words should live on in the language, the teachers tend to pronounce the Latin words the exact same way they are pronounced nowadays in their own language, instead of the classical way.)  For example: In German ""c""s are pronounced like the ""ts"" of cats before e's and i's at school; so when reading the word ""civis"" we would say ""tseevis"" instead of ""keewis"" because we know the word ""Zivilisation"" from German which is pronounced that way. On the other hand I guess that Italians will learn ""cheevis"" at school, because they tend to pronounce c's as ch before e's and i's in their language. (I know I probably should've used IPA instead of trying to write everything in an English way of pronouncing the letters, but since OP didn't use IPA either, I didn't want to confuse him)  Using such different ways of pronunciation is fine, of course, but I personally think that if we try to imitate the classical grammar, we should as a consequence also try to imitate the classical pronunciation.  All in all, there's a big chaos between classical and modernised pronunciations even at my university - even by the professors - and since everyone does pronounce the letters differently, various different ways of pronunciation are common and people will accept them all. So although classically it would be ""eye"" for ""ae"", noone will corrrect you, if you say an ""e"" instead - at least not at my university. Could be different at other places, though."

Can you provide an example of what each would look like in Latin and what they might mean in English, using any English word for the noun that you want? So ""(Twisting/corrupting/warping/mutating) Drink"" or ""Drink that has been (twisted/corrupted/warped/mutated)""?

In Latin you can't say that, twisting is necessarily transitive, it has to twist something (else).   This has nothing to do with word order. In Latin word order is very flexible, and adjectives can come before or after the nouns they modify, regardless of whether (if they are participles) they are transitive or intransitive.

The scene features John Cleese as a centurion and Graham Chapman as Brian, at that stage a would-be member of the revolutionary group the ""People's Front of Judea"". To prove himself worthy to be a member of the group, Brian has to daub an anti-Roman slogan on the walls of Governor Pontius Pilate's palace in Jerusalem, under cover of darkness. He has just finished when the centurion sees him. Brian is terrified and clearly expects to be killed on the spot. However, Cleese plays the centurion as an irascible Latin teacher, and instead of killing him he corrects Brian's sloppy grammar at sword-point.  ""What's this, then?"" he says. ""Romanes eunt domus? People called Romanes they go the house?""  Brian is then forced to remember the correct Latin declension or conjugation for each word as if he were a delinquent school boy. ""Now"", says Cleese when they eventually get to the correct form Romani ite domum, ""write it out 100 times.... If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off."" Brian does so, and becomes a hero. In subsequent scenes, various Roman soldiers can be seen removing the graffiti.

latin,311cbj,Onomacritus,6,Wed Apr 1 09:23:48 2015 UTC,"Whether a given construction ""exists"" depends entirely on the period and the register of speech you are talking about.   E.g. Petronius writes in his Satiricon: ""Quia tu, qui potes loquere, non loquis"". Does this mean that we have to rewrite our textbooks or that we shouldn't correct a student who says ""loquo"" for ""loquor""? Of course not. All it means is that Petronius uses - in this specific place - a vulgar register of speech that our grammars do usually not cover and which we don't want to imitate.   Latin education generally focuses on the language used by Caesar and Cicero in their prose. Of course there is more out there - in terms of morphology, in terms of syntax, in terms of vocabulary, in terms of locutions, in terms of orthography. But experience shows that it is better to give students a firm grounding in one style of Latin first (the one most influential for subsequent literary production) and then explain the differences in other authors as one encounters them.   A good teacher should of course not create the impression that grammatical rules are set in stone and exist in some realm beyond time and space. Naevius isn't referring to infinitive formation when he writes in his epitaph: ""Obliti sunt Romae loquier lingua Latina"" - but taken out of context it's nevertheless a good quote to drive that point home. We might say ""The Latin of Naevius is archaic and wrong."", Naevius says ""You've forgotten how to speak Latin"".  As for Vergil: Poets follow different rules than prose authors (although there are some prose authors who write like poets) and most of the time this means a license towards more archaisms and/or more Graecisms. When I first approached Vergil I was irritated by the way he uses datives for movements (""it clamor caelo"", ""venit medio"", ...). But does this really warrant to be treated in a textbook that describes ""the Latin grammar"" at large? It's not something you'll encounter in 90% of the authors you'll read, it's not something you should imitate in your own prose (and if you're composing poetry you're supposed to know what you're doing) and it's adequately explained with a simple footnote that reads ""caelo (dat.) = in caelum"". Imo a sensible reaction is ""Ok, guess that's just how Vergil writes."" not ""My whole Latin education has been a lie!"""
latin,311cbj,bitterlatinist,1 point,Thu Apr 2 09:13:28 2015 UTC,"All good points, but too much of the ""Cicero and Caesar are perfect"" attitude will eventually lead everyone to write the same stale Latin. If anything, they are simply the most consistent with their grammar and vocabulary.   That's all well and good while your learning, I agree with that, but eventually people should develop their own kind of style based upon what they like to read and what sounds good to them.   IMO eventually everyone is going to have to unlearn their textbook Latin skills and find some sort of middle ground between orthodox and unorthodox Latin."
latin,311cbj,translostation,2,Thu Apr 2 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"The issue here is probably that your teacher was far too confident in suggesting ""rules"" and you, as is the case with so many Latin students, were far to committed to learning them as ""rules"". Latin is a language like any other. For every rule that exists, there are instances where it is broken for one reason or another. Perhaps if your teacher had been clearer about that up front, you'd feel less cheated. My students are constantly given the warning ""this is how it works in the type of Latin I'm currently teaching you, and which is considered the 'gold standard' for the language not a series of rules obediently followed in every instance."" Rules are helpful, but they're just the beginning to seeing a much bigger picture."
latin,311cbj,translatorstroubles,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:54:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have to unlearn your textbook skills.  Honestly, I think part of the problem is that so many of the grammatical uses we're taught as rules only exist artificially.  In other words, they're grafted on top of the language not really a part of it in any inherent sense.  So don't unlearn them, just blend them.  Sometimes the difference between two genitive uses is so small as to be unimportant, and it's best to just shrug your shoulders and accept that gasp you really do understand what it means without justifying your reading by recourse to a grammar.  This extends to compositions where you want to use a word that you feel should mean something, but you can't find a dictionary to justify it.  I just had an experience like this, reading Martial 1.46. In that poem, ""Propero"" means, I'm cumming, or I'm about to cum, or I'm getting close or some such.  And it was immediately clear to me what it meant on a first reading.  Then when I was doing research, I ran into all these old interpretations that said the speaker was ""just in a hurry"" which is the boring use of propero.  Eventually good research and the modern lack of prudery won out and I found contemporary evidence that backed up my intuition, but it gave me a heart attack and I almost pulled the commentary.  Point is, at some point, especially if you read an author a lot, you'll know better than the dictionary.  It's not grammatical, but you know what pisses me off?  No one spent any time teaching me how to read a critical apparatus or hand-written manuscripts.  We have the internet...it wouldn't have been that hard!"
latin,311cbj,translatorstroubles,2,Fri Apr 3 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where, but I remember seeing an genitive of separation somewhere.  I remember reading it and then second guessing myself and paging through grammars for the next 30 minutes because those aren't supposed to exist in Latin.  It was definitely classical, but also in a context that would have excused the Graecism.  edit: I always love finding these. They normally enlarge my sense of what is grammatically possible.  *Pace to /u/bitterlatinist, but I think that we could do worse than letting Virgil slip into our prose composition.  I remember taking a Greek composition class, and I was graded harshly for using Homeric genitive forms.  I see the instructional purpose in discouraging me, but a polite reminder to use standard Attic next time would have done and it sure was a great way to ruin my enthusiasm (though it didn't quite work, genitives in -οιο for the win!).  Why shouldn't Virgil occasionally invade my prose?  As long as I'm not explicitly trying to ape the style of a given author (which is totally valuable and should be done) or trying to explicitly write in a standard dialect, I just don't see the harm."

""Dixit:"", ""Sic orsus est:"" and ""Ita farier infit:"" all have their place in Latin but you can't just randomly substitute them for each other -  the language you use always has to be appropriate to the topic you are talking about and the setting you are speaking in.   If you have the sensitivity to pull it off then go ahead & incorporate poetic language, archaisms, vulgar elements, ... into your prose (as far as I'm concerned, naturally whoever is grading your work might see things differently).

latin,30y6wr,Luksoropoulos,3,Tue Mar 31 17:52:25 2015 UTC,I think you mean ne + subjunctive (not conj.) =)
latin,30y6wr,BornToBeWild91,3,Tue Mar 31 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting, it's called Konjunktiv in German, didn't know the term ""subjunctive"". Is it because it's mainly used in subordinated clauses?

latin,30y6wr,Luksoropoulos,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"I should really check my forms. I just used what the comment or above used, so yes, it should be a present subjunctive.  I'm also not exactly sure about the use of infinitives with iubeo, so I couldn't tell you. I know that jussive noun clauses are used with Verbs of asking, begging, and demanding. I believe this is also referred to as an indirect command."
latin,30y6wr,NLBuescher,2,Tue Mar 31 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're right with Subjunctive Perfect for these interdictions, I just don't know why it is used, but it is used by the authors (although Subjunctive Present would make more sense after Consecutio Temporum as you said)^^  And iubeo is just the one exception which strangely is used with infinitive; other than that you are right that iussive verbs are used with ut/ne.  But could you explain to me what ""jussive noun clause"" means? I'm not very familiar with these English terms. I guess, it just are jussive ut-clauses, right? So ""iussive"" means in a commanding sense and clause means a subordinated sentence, right? But why noun?

Of course, I don't know if the Romans would have avoided full elision because it sounded awkward to them; that's why I asked. It is possible, even likely, that I'm just not used to it."
latin,30tkph,bitterlatinist,2,Tue Mar 31 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"I was reading something the other day (Brooks, Reading Latin Poetry Aloud) that suggested that they kept a vestigial pronunciation of elided vowels. I think the author's reasoning was that full elision would obscure the meaning of something like 'nescio et fieri sentio et excrucior' if what you heard was 'nesciet fieri sentiet excrucior'. I find that quite persuasive, but on the other hand, what little evidence we do have (ancient grammarians, the existence of prodelision) seems rather to point the other way."

That's part of the motivation for what I was trying to do here, but I couldn't find a vestige of -o that satisfied, until I just pronounced and held on to it, in which case it wasn't really elided.  I think my instincts were right at least: here an author explains that they avoided elision of long vowels. He marks out this case especially: a long vowel at the end of a word with two syllables whose first syllable is short."

There are some circumstances in which it is grammatically unambiguous which sense the FPP is supposed to take.  As happens so often in language, the rest of the time, the only way to tell the difference is context.  The example sentence you gave supports the gerundive reading best, I think, but what do I know.  Here are some (I think) unambiguous examples I just made up:   Captivi interficiendi effugere conati sunt. (unambiguously FPP, sense of obligation will depend on context) Captivi, ait Caesar, militibus interficiendi sunt.  (FPP because passive periphrastic depends on sense of obligation, no object) Milites gladios sumpserunt ad captivos interficiendos.  (Gerundive because no sense of obligation; note that semantic object of ad is the action, not the sense of the noun that's it's grammatical object)"
latin,30pjb7,correon,9,Sun Mar 29 18:05:59 2015 UTC,"Captivi interficiendi effugere conati sunt. (unambiguously FPP, sense of obligation will depend on context)   If you believe this to be good Latin then you must be trying to imitate 4th or 5th century authors. Because when you look for real examples of such usage you'll arrive at Ammian (e.g. ""certaturus leviter ibi statuit immorari, alimentis destituendos forsitan cedere existimans Persas"").   The ""future passive participle"" interpretation of the gerundive is overhyped. Painting the gerundive as some kind of participle is useful to explain the difference between gerundium and gerundive (as nobody knows what a ""verbal adjective"" is supposed to be if not a participle) but that can be adequately achieved by referring to its etymology (originally present passive participle, secundus = sequens/secutus is a very transparent example) without bringing the future tense into it at all.    Only in Late Latin does the gerundive take on a future meaning.  The sense of obligation is classical but limited to the construction gerundive + form of esse. The list of gerundives that can be used attributively at all is pretty short (laudandus, horrendus, secundus, ferendus, ...). If you don't know your gerundive of choice can be used that way then it almost certainly can't. On a tangent: as a rule people use attributive participles way too liberally. With the best authors ""futurus"" is the only future active participle ever used attributively. The present active participle is to be used sparingly in good Latin (e.g. the opposite of mortuus is vivus not vivens, saw someone do that the other day on here but didn't bother to complain). And telling entire stories through the use of participles is something best left to Greeks."
latin,30pjb7,bitterlatinist,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"To clear something up, the gerundive is the future passive participle; two names, same thing. What you're referring to is the difference between the gerund (""we learn by doing"") and the gerundive / future passive participle (""something that is to be done, i.e. something that must be done).   The gerund is a verbal noun, while the gerundive / future passive participle is a verbal adjective."

With a bit of theatrics you can fill the gaps in the text and make it come alive: imagine how confused and frightened Septimus must be when the door has vanished! He had already been somewhat apprehensive before (timebat) and turned back to the door in order to escape this strange place. I imagine ""qui non puer timidus erat"" (much better: esset - but I guess students aren't familiar with the subjunctive yet) describes his own attempts at self-encouragement ""I'm not a timid boy!

latin,30ohku,ReedsAndSerpents,13,Sun Mar 29 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's similar to Greek's 3rd declension. For example the word for ""goat"" is ""αιξ"" (aix - I'm on my tablet so no breathing marks) but the root actually is αιγ- (aig-) so the genitive is αιγος (aigos). Why is this? Because the nominative for the Greek 3rd declension ends with -ς (-s), and when the root ends with a γ (g) instead of being -γς (-gs) it's -ξ (-x). Latin 3rd declension ends with -s usually. The root for ""rex"" is actually reg- (genitive ""regis"", pl nom "" reges""). So instead of being ""regs"" it's ""rex""."
latin,30ohku,E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb,8,Sun Mar 29 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"The root of the word rex is *reg-, and the regular nominative singular ending in third declension is -s (due to sound changes, this isn't always obvious).

latin,30m33f,hlly,2,Sun Mar 29 01:44:55 2015 UTC,Adjectives are quite frequently used in place of adverbs when paired with the subject of the verb.
latin,30m33f,Onomacritus,2,Sun Mar 29 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense: you can't have an implied finite verb in the same clause as currit, because that is also a finite verb and each clause only has one. /u/bitterlatinist is correct that like some dialects of modern English, Latin readily uses adjectives with the same meaning as adverbs."
latin,30m33f,hlly,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:33:43 2015 UTC,You probably already knew it on some level: does citus est currit look correct?
latin,30m33f,hlly,2,Sun Mar 29 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"I would use something like otiose rege [navem].  You wouldn't use the verb volare, since this is intransitive, i.e., it means ""fly"" like a bird flies, not ""fly"" as in ""pilot something."" For sailing, besides navigare = ""to sail,"" Latin uses gubernare, regere, and ducere (all = ""pilot"" or ""steer"").  Otiose is the adverbial form of otiosus and means ""calmly"" or ""in a leisurely manner."""

latin,30lxk9,jumpingmustang,3,Sat Mar 28 16:09:22 2015 UTC,It seems to be more typical to say accedens or crescens than surgens with aestus.
latin,30lxk9,EcceVulpes,4,Sat Mar 28 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think I like what crescens implies better.  From the Perseus word study tool:   II. Of things already in existence, to rise in height, to rise, grow, grow up, thrive, increase, etc."
latin,30lxk9,bitterlatinist,2,Sat Mar 28 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know how close an association the expression ""the rising tide"" really maintains to the actual tide (i.e. the dynamics of ebb and flow) in colloquial use. Maybe a less literal translation would express the sentiment better?  In English the tide comes in/rises and goes out/falls, in Latin aestus accedit/crescit aut recedit/minuit. Very regular, inherently dualistic (ebb & flow) and not scary to anyone living at the sea.  The ""surgere"" you had set your eyes upon is something different: mare/aequor/pontus (con)surgit describes the swelling of the sea during a storm."
latin,30jjom,egorin,4,Fri Mar 27 22:34:39 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd need to know what you mean by ""for.""  Also whether you're talking about a reason or purpose for the seizing or a reason or purpose of the day since the English is grammatically ambiguous.  Do you mean ""Sieze the day for [the purpose of] value creation""?  carpe diem valoris creandi causa.     Do you mean ""Sieze the day for [the honor / name of] value creation""?  carpe diem pro valore creando.

latin,30jjom,correon,5,Sat Mar 28 01:19:39 2015 UTC,ad + acc. gerundive also works as a way to express purpose. Allen and Greenough says it's normal and usually used in short expressions of which I must agree this would be one.
latin,30jjom,IntelVoid,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think that one is more correct than the other? If the gerundive is better, incorporating Intelvoid's comment below, should it be: carpe diem ad valorem creandum causa (not sure what to do with causa)?"
latin,30jjom,IntelVoid,2,Sat Mar 28 02:09:05 2015 UTC,"it would either be 'ad valorem creandum' or 'valoris creandi causa, not both ad and causa."
latin,30jjom,IntelVoid,3,Sat Mar 28 02:30:42 2015 UTC,It's generally better to use an adjective with a gerundive than a gerund with a genitive (i.e. ad valorem faciendum)

I'll post the next week's thread on thursday and leave it up for 2 weeks.  l.10 good.  l.27 yes, 'certe' can be something like 'indeed, really, certainly'.  l.34 good.   l.47 yes, good. patī can be tricky when used like this.  l.59 a) there's no significant difference between certē and certō. b) 'but certainly I know that that he knew a certain woman'. aliquam refers to a person who is 'definite' but also 'unknown', i.e.  l.69 hōc auditō is a short ablative absolute construction. Does that help?  Pensum:   You generally don't use alius to contrast with alius except in alii...alii phrases. alter is a better word for alternating between a pair of things. ā takes an ablative. Because he fell 'from' the tree, you might prefer dē. -ne doesn't imply anything about the answer to the question, so 'Has his leg's bone been broken?' This is a sentence in which I'd probably use the imperfect in the answer, pulsabat. narrāre shouldn't take eum in the accusative, it wants a dative for the person who it is told to. good. good.

I took it to my Latin reading group and one chap quite liked it so I pushed the rest of it on him.  To me it was like a doughy brick tasting of a bit of sweet spice.  I also notice that many Roman sweet recipes that I've seen are more like ""halva""-style sweets: more of a porridge type consistency than a baked cake or pie. Such dishes are still quite popular in the Middle East today, but I can't think of modern western equivalents so much."

If you just need to know what a word means, you don't necessarily need all of the usage notes and examples in a large, scholarly dictionary like L&S or the OLD.   Each of those have some things to consider against the other. The scope of Lewis and Short is wider than OLD, which generally does not consider texts written more recently than AD 200. So if, in your Latin studies, you are interested in Medieval or later Latin, you may prefer them to OLD.   The OLD gives a more comprehensive treatment of strictly classical Latin works, and I find it to be more user friendly, particularly because typesetting is much easier to scan to quickly find a pertinent entry."

latin,30e4fu,KeatingOrRoark,10,Thu Mar 26 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"E/ex = from, utilizing the -x in front of a succeeding vowel; takes the ablative case  Infinitis= infinitium in the ablative plural. So, actually, it should be ""infinito"", because you want the singular.  unum = nominative, subject; ""one""  So the entire phrase should be: ""Ex infinito, unum"""
latin,30e4fu,NLBuescher,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"So the idea of ""E Pluribus Unum"" is ""One (nation) out of many"" (pluribus being a form of plus literally means ""more (nations)"", but is used here to represent a multitude)  Therefore, ""Ex Infinitis Unum"" literally translates to ""One (thing) out of infinite things"". ""Ex"" is another form of ""E"" and it requires an ablative. Since ""unum"" and ""infinitum"" are adjectives, they're used here as substantives.  TL;DR: * Ex - out of (needs ablative) * infinitis - infinite things * unum - one (thing)  Edit: words"
latin,30e4fu,correon,4,Thu Mar 26 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"infinitis means ""a number things which do not have limits"" not ""limitlessness"" or ""a limitless number of things.""

latin,30e4fu,NLBuescher,3,Thu Mar 26 18:10:10 2015 UTC,That's correct. I used infinitum because OP used it. The decision on which word to use really depends on the meaning that is intended.
latin,30e4fu,thrasumachos,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"So to clarify for OP, it would be ex infinitate unum"

You're not actually saying ""all (each and every) work,"" you're saying ""all (only) work"".    Also insipidus (-a -um) is a 1st/2nd declension adjective.  And as /u/eudokus pointed out, puer (-i m.) is a 2nd declension noun.  Should be insipidum puerum.  Otherwise, though, the grammar works and the word choice is good.

latin,30bs79,Foundinantiquity,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"There are two ways of translating ""when"" in Latin:   a) using a word that means ""when"" (cum, quando) and making a temporal (or ""time"") clause. Eg. quando mentulam extrahis, ""when you pull out [your] dick""  b) using a construction called the ablative absolute. A phrase usually involving a participle is put in the ablative, and no word for ""when"" should be used in Latin. Eg. vasculo extracto, literally ""with tool pulled out"", or ""when you have pulled out your tool"". I prefer the ablative absolute construction because it feels more punchy to me.  You can't combine the two and still have it make sense in Latin - it's unintelligible. Also, verb endings gotta be right, or else intendo means ""I aim"" rather than ""aim! (command)""  I can fix the suggestion you made, though:  cum extrahis, intende huc  extrahis, ""you pull out"", does kind of need an object, but this phrase should at least be intelligible."

The least creative they got was in giving places names like Germania (germanus means ""neighbor,"" so think Neighboria or Neighborstan) and Mare nostrum (""our sea,"" which is what they called the Mediterranean, cheeky as they were).

For me, genealogy is (one of) my passions, which has introduced me to a variety of insights into language. Latin is common throughout Europe in church records going back hundreds of years, but I've also learned some German along the way (including some unique writing styles, like Sütterlin) which I never knew, and got to brush up on my French, thanks to Napoleon's conquests.

This person learned a lot about languages, but did not directly learn a language in her linguistics course.  And the computers thing is about trying to apply statistical analysis to languages to try and make statistical predictions about the nature of language. Noam Chomsky considers this kind of ""lets plug all the numbers into a computer and see what it spits out as a statistical tendency"" investigation to be bollocks because he wants to find the actual underlying forces (I saw a lecture of his on Youtube where he says this and I can't for the life of me find it again), and maybe the earlier commenter shares this view.

It's not like I can speak Italian now or anything, but reading it is easier.  On the other hand, since you already know a couple Romance languages I'm not sure you'll see much of a difference. And I don't think it will help much with German, except that some of the grammatical concepts you'll learn might apply there too.  At any rate, the biggest reason to learn Latin that doesn't feel like a cop-out (like ""it'll help with SAT vocab"") is that all the greatest thinkers from the Roman period until just a couple hundred years ago knew and wrote in the language. You'd be unlocking huge amounts of literature and history. Finally, this is much more subjective but I think Latin is an elegantly beautiful language that deserves to be spoken in and of itself."

latin,3017ok,translostation,6,Mon Mar 23 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"I speak Mongolian, which has 8 cases. You automatically and intuitively know what case endings to use to express what concepts. That's just what it is to have an active command of an inflected language.  If Latin is different in this regard, it's only because there is some amount of ambiguity in some endings. But that ambiguity is almost always resolved within 1-3 words. So I can't see how that would be more troubling than ambiguity in other languages.  The Romans didn't stop and think, ""is -ae a dative? what kind of dative?"", they would have understood its role in the sentence without parsing it, and gone on listening to the rest of the sentence."
latin,3017ok,IntelVoid,5,Mon Mar 23 21:03:16 2015 UTC,"When you hear 'the boy gives the girls...', since you can't see the apostrophe, it could be either 'the boy gives the girls [apples]' or 'the boy gives the girl's [apples to a pig]'.  You don't know whether 'girls' is dative plural or genitive singular (or genitive plural) until you hear the rest, but you hear the rest too quickly to realise there was ever an ambiguity."
latin,3017ok,ReedsAndSerpents,2,Tue Mar 24 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"Because it wouldn't makes sense otherwise.   If you were able to show someone's mentally work in the impossibly quick computing that the brain does, it would look like ""puer [subject, male, singular] puellae [girl, girls plural, case unknown] malum [accusative, singular] [the boy is doing something to the apple] dat [the boy is giving the apple] [case resolved, girl, singular, dative].   This is kind of why the Romans like to have the verb at the end, because you kind of don't know exactly how things are going to go until that last word.   And sometimes Latin also creates confusing sentences where things could easily be reversed, especially for third declension nouns. In that case, we fall back on word order to (hopefully) make sense of it.   It only seems difficult because you aren't used to it. If you were twenty and spoke Latin since childhood you would have used the inflections millions of times and they would cease to be grammatical concepts, they would just be normal speech like /u/translostation said."

""All gods will die"" on the other hand, is straightforward:  omnēs deī morientur  These words can be put in any order, and usually in pithy phrases like this they mix it up a bit, emphasizing something by putting it first or saving a surprised until last. It all depends on what exactly you're trying to convey. My personal choice would be:   omnēs morientur deī  (See the sidebar about how Google Translate is always wrong.

latin,2zxx9u,Warle,2,Sun Mar 22 21:17:58 2015 UTC,"There is no need to ""accurately disambiguate"", Latin uses aedes/aedis in a very consistent manner.  Aedes (singular) is one room.   If your flat only has a single room, then aedes is perfectly appropriate (in English we often refer to a one-room apartment simply as someone's room).  ""Castor's room"" (aedes Castoris) is his temple and what else could it possibly be? When aedes refers to a temple it always has some clarifying attribute (aedes sacra, aedes Castoris).  Several rooms (aedes, plural) make up a building. Again hard to misunderstand: if you translate ""datum ex aedibus Vaticanis"" as ""given from the Vatican rooms"" the English phrasing might be suboptimal but the sense is clear.  I grant that the singular form ""aedes"" could be confusing but if the Cambridge course prefers ""aedis"" then I don't see the issue.
