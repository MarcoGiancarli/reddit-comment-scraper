NewYorkMets,3e3nf6,cpacane,5,Tue Jul 21 19:14:43 2015 UTC,The ineptitude of the offense is so mind boggling.  Every day I see tweets that are similar that you just can't believe.  The fact that our pitching staff is out hitting and out slugging our bench is just insane.  How does Harvey have 40% of the RBIs over the last 27 innings?  You don't think the offense can get worse and it does.  Then a guy like Murphy gets a hit and makes numerous errors or baserunning mistakes.

Sandy clearly does not want to sacrifice the intermediate future for a boom/bust type of deal or contact.

NewYorkMets,3e2vld,BarristanSelfie,10,Tue Jul 21 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"This isn't to say that Campbell is a star or anything, but he's been getting pretty shafted on hard-hit balls. If he had an MLB average on them, he'd have 7 extra hits which would raise his OPS at least 88 points (assuming all singles)."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xnerdyxrealistx,9,Tue Jul 21 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like this whole team has gotten shafted on hard-hit balls. Just yesterday there were a lot of hard hit balls that could've easily been hits, but the defense for the Nats was played perfectly."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xmarcs,4,Tue Jul 21 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"My problem isn't the stat itself but how much people run with it. I get that he should be hitting more than he is. We do this every year though. The last 3 years I've heard more about the ins and outs of BABIP than I care for and now we have exit velo. It's nice that the Mets are hitting balls hard and it's shitty that they're not getting hits from hard hit balls. Maybe 15 years that would mean more to me, but the games so analytics-driven now and people know where to field against us. The whole team hits balls hard and the whole team has shitty averages.  Curtis went through the same thing last year didn't he? We heard these rumblings about Cuddyer months in. ""He can't possible keep this BA going."" When you look at spray charts, every line drive Eric hits is right at a position player. http://imgur.com/POevst9  That's where Curtis was last year and where a good majority of the problem is with this entire team at present. Look I understood with Curtis, the guy was an established Major Leaguer and we were looking for a reason for him to bounce back. How are we doing the same thing with Soup? I mean I like the guy, but it's time to get him back to AAA for a bit. The fact that his 3-4 outs a game are hit with his contact means nothing to me if he can't find a hit in the outfield."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xmarcs,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I think there's two distinct things at hand here. If we're just looking at future performance in isolation, I would argue that it doesn't make sense to drop Campbell to AAA. His issues aren't procedural, and the procedural end suggests that his future performance should be better, and likely better than an AAA replacement.  That said, the second thing is that this isn't an argument to prevent the Mets from improving their roster. If they're going to replace him with, say, Ben Zobrist or Michael Conforto then go for it. The Mets should be trying to assemble the best 25 players they can. If they get someone better and he's not in that bracket, he should go down. But I would argue right now that he's one of their 25 best players."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xmarcs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"He may be one of our best 25 players in terms of his floor, but if he's not hitting like it then how do you keep putting him up there assuming he'll learn how to hit the ball into space? I get that this isn't something he can fix with a vacation to Nevada, but this is Campbell's sophomore year and it seems they've figured him out. He can't send anything high in the zone to open space. All they do is pitch him up and he hits line drives to their OFs. We need to start having discussions about where the outs are. Where the problem is. Especially since this guy has been awful in the field. I get he has range of positions but honestly I'd take Kirk over Soup right now. At least Kirk has defense."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Senor_Met,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"Hitting to open space isn't a skill, at least insofar as pulling/timing in general.   That said, it doesn't look like his hard hit outs (with few exceptions) are just from hitting the ball at people. Most of the balls to right/center look like long rundowns Link"
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment on that point without knowing where the LF, CF, and RF were playing against him though. If you overlap your chart on the spray chart I posted, he hits most of his linedrives to pretty deep central LF and pretty deep central RF and I can definitely understand why they were caught if they were positioned to his tendencies. Throw the ball up in the zone and he tends to hit into the same 3 spots 60% of the time.  Edit: I know it's not something you fully intend to do at every PA, but quality players know how to use the entire field. AAAA players make the field look small."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Jewtheist,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:08 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there seems to be little to no correlation between hard hit rate and BABIP
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Jewtheist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"FWIW, this isn't Fangraphs' Hard Hit rates, it's ESPN's own system (which just from the numbers suggests it uses a higher criteria). Perhaps more importantly, hard hit rate would correlate less strongly with BABIP than expected because home runs are almost exclusively hard-hit."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,PhilipK_Dick,5,Tue Jul 21 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Proof that Hard Hit Rate is useless.  Maybe he deserves to hit .200 instead of whatever number he is hitting but from watching him, you can see that he shouldn't be doing his hitting in the Major Leagues."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Senor_Met,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. But it moves the needle from ""he is the worst baseball player I've ever seen, gouge my eyes out please"" to ""he is a pretty terrible baseball player"" for me."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,PhilipK_Dick,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"FWIW: Campbell is 17/34 on hard hit balls this season, about .200 points below the MLB average .700ish.   That alone is the difference between ""Campbell has been awful"" and ""Campbell is a roughly average hitter"", even if you assume the difference to be all singles."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xmarcs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not just talking about hitting. ""Kinda maybe not the greatest hitter but okay sometimes cause he can hit singles maybe a double or homer here or there and get on base"" combined with zero other tools or anything resembling good baseballing, and often the opposite of good baseballing, is still pretty terrible. Impossible for a starting infielder, and really not good at all for a backup.   He's just not a player that should be seeing the field on a contending team.   disclaimer: this does not mean I'm not excited about the Mets contending or that I don't look forward to his hard hit balls becoming hits more often."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:12 2015 UTC,Do you really think Soup is a roughly average hitter?  Have you watched any Mets baseball this season?
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,PhilipK_Dick,5,Tue Jul 21 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Why not? He was roughly average last year, and he cut his strikeouts by a third, raised his walk rate by two thirds, is hitting for a bit more power, and is evidently hitting the ball harder overall than last year.   If Michael Conforto came up and put up Campbell's exact stats, everyone would be running to talk about how his BABIP is so low and he's so unlucky. But Campbell's not supposed to be any good, so that must mean he's just bad.   But to answer your question, yes. I think there are still some issues in his game, and that he's pulling the ball a bit too much, but what he has done at the plate - his discipline and contact quality - suggest much better results than he's gotten. And the post supports that."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,splenda806,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"Also, Soup was actually a pretty good hitter in the minors. I wanted him to start the year with the team in 2014, I figured he'd be a better Josh Satin"
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,xmarcs,0,Tue Jul 21 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"If Michael Conforto came up and put up Campbell's exact stats, everyone would be running to talk about how his BABIP is so low and he's so unlucky. But Campbell's not supposed to be any good, so that must mean he's just bad.   That is because Soup was in AA ball for parts of 3 years through his 25th birthday.  Conforto has taken all of 42 games to prove that he is better than the competition he is facing there.  There is a reason Soup was drafted in the 8th round and took 7 years to get a taste of Major League baseball.  He is just not a very skilled ball player."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Senor_Met,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"So your argument is that if Conforto came up and did exactly what Campbell has done, it would mean that Conforto is good and Campbell is bad because Conforto was a first round pick and Campbell wasn't.   That makes literally zero sense. You can say Conforto is more talented - he sure as shit is - and that he has a higher ceiling, but results are results. Jacob deGrom must be worse than Matt Harvey because he was a 9th round pick and took four years to debut at 26 when Harvey was up only two years later! Someone should tell Justin Turner and Jose Bautista to quit because they weren't quick-rising early picks!   There is a reason Soup . . . He is just not a very skilled ball player.   Yes. Above average walk rates, below average strikeout rates, above average hard hit rates, and positional versatility aren't the results of any type of skill. Surely, he's just walking up to the plate and standing around with his thumb up his ass and any good things that happen are just the result of natural selection getting stuck in traffic on the LIE."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,TweetPoster,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:15 2015 UTC,any good things that happen are just the result of natural selection getting stuck in traffic on the LIE   There's a difference between glorifying the outs of a .200 hitter and not giving a player credit for a whole bunch of line drives to middle of the outfield in a 3 HR season.
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,nymetfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"Turner was random.  No one saw that coming.     Bautista hit 23 HR in 112 games at AA.  Soup never hit more than 10 in any year.  Yes, positional versatility is a good thing (the trademark of a guy who doesn't hit).  Walk rate is good if a guy gets his share if hits - which soup does not.  I can see that you are trying to sway people that Soup is better than his numbers but I am telling you that he is just not a good hitter.  Pitchers pitch to him because he is an easy out and he still does nothing with what they give him."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,Jayk_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"You can tell me whatever you want, but you need to come up with a shred of anything beyond ""he wasn't expected to amount to much"" and ""he's hitting .170 this year"". You're not making a convincing argument of anything other than that you disagree."
NewYorkMets,3e2vld,cravelo16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to sway you.  You believe in the Soup.  I do not.

I just don't see the point you are making."

If this is the case, then I'm with Alderson. Beane can go fuck off. He doesn't get a top prospect for a rental AND get us to take on salary. Who does he think he is? Sandy Alderson?

NewYorkMets,3e0yg4,atoms12123,14,Tue Jul 21 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"All of the ""but he's a ballplayer"" arguments kind of went out the window by the second time he forgot how many outs there were this season and made a bad play because of it (got doubled off on a fly ball with 1 out when he kept running thinking there were two outs, threw to 1B instead of taking an easy out at home plate which allowed a run to score again thinking there was 1 out instead of 2). And then today he commits a THIRD mental error on the season by not throwing home when Harper broke from third during the rundown. And he almost let an infield hit drop in today when he had to dive for a routine infield pop up that he misjudged. Not only has he sucked in the stats, he's sucked at all the mental aspects of the game that supposedly made him such a ""ballplayer"" that were supposed to overcome his poor production on paper."
NewYorkMets,3e0yg4,xmarcs,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:18 2015 UTC,It's the fact that he sometimes looks okay at the dish. The hard-hit balls and the BABIP show that he does have a little bit of something but when you look at the spray chart you see he's just smacking line drives 6 feet away from positioned LF and RF. That's why it's rough that we're leaning on these guys and why I can kinda understand why the Mets fear a similar situation if they bring up Conforto.. Welcome to modern day baseball boys. Good contact is not worth what it once was. Soup shouldn't be here.
NewYorkMets,3e0yg4,standupdouble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:21 2015 UTC,"He always seems to get it together for a big game right when he's reaching that tipping point of being so terrible that there's no way he won't get demoted. The problem is that having a good game every 3 weeks or so doesn't make you a passable major league player if you play like a little leaguer the rest of the time.    -Edit- On the bright side, he's been so terrible lately that maybe he's due for a big game in order to try to save his own ass yet again?"

Washington is going to be VERY good next year when fully healthy.  This season,  they have had key players injured.  The Mets have an opportunity to take advantage of that.    The fact is, as amazing as the pitching has been,  the Mets can't compete with the way the lineup and bench have been.  Mayberry is this year's Chris Young, and CY was already gone this time last year.  Campbell simply can't play, Muno is Muno, and Kirk, as incredible as that 3 HR game was, still hasn't shown to me that he can be a capable MLB player.    If they go through July 31 without making some sort of move, whether that be calling someone up or making a trade, I think the fan base will be extremely disappointed."

NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,bmd4567,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:36 2015 UTC,If they don't make a move this year I would finally concede that ownership and management are not in it to win it.    The team has a ton of offensive needs.  Lagares is hurt and he needs to be put on the DL.  It's time for him to get surgery.  He isn't hitting or fielding decently let alone GG level.  They need someone to play CF.  Parra plays all over the OF and can be slotted into CF.  It's time to give up on the knee of Cuddyer too.  Give Conforto that shot.  Throw him into the mix and put him in there with some protection behind him not just in the 7th spot where they can pitch around him. Zobrist slotted into 2B would be lovely too.  As much as I wanted to give Flores a shot this year I think there is something off with him.  He could split time at SS depending on whose pitching and the ratio of ground balls to fly balls.  They live with Murph at 3B and if there is a miracle and Wright comes back there is a ton of depth.  2 potential FA to be bats for a couple of minor league pieces.  Maybe Nimmo and Fulmer and you might just have enough offense to make some noise.  The way it stands now though they have no chance at making a run.
NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,jerseyjokes,10,Tue Jul 21 20:05:50 2015 UTC,Fine. A move isn't going to magically make 8 other guys hit.

NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,caldera15,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:26 2015 UTC,"I would be disappointed, but I think the real problem was the weak offseason. If they're unwilling to part with top prospects, I can understand that. But then you have to be willing to actually invest in the free agent market. Signing guys from the bargain bin doesn't work if you aren't willing to improve through trades.   At the same time, if they were going to make a trade in season, I would have preferred we did it 2 months ago when it was obvious we had a terrible bench and needed at least another bat in the lineup. Then if we lost a prospect, at least the player we got in return was helping us for 4 or 4.5 months instead of 2.  I prefer to acquire a player that helps for the next few years, but that doesn't look likely at this point. So what annoyed me was the offseason, and if they have a similar do nothing offseason after this year, I'll be really pissed."
NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,gometrule,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"who should we of signed though? Nelson Cruz? He's bad defensively and required too many years for his age. Am I forgetting anybody else who was on the market? Next off-season we have some options in Upton, Heyward and maybe Alex Gordon. I'd like to see us open the wallet for one of those three if we can't make a trade."
NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,caldera15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"We're talking about acquiring Justin Upton now, who was also traded this offseason. If we're considering giving up top talent for a guy, I'd rather have him for a full season than 2 months.   The Cards got Heyward. Aoki has been good. Rasmus has been good.   I would have liked a good relief pitcher for the 8th inning.   If we were going to throw defense out with the Cuddyer signing though, I'd certainly have preferred Cruz, even if he comes for an extra 2 years. I don't think the Mariners would have any trouble trading him right now for example, but we couldn't give Cuddyer away.  Bench player(s) who could actually pinch hit would have been good.   We didn't have to do all of these things, but I think Sandy could have found ways to improve the team beyond what he did. Right now his acquisitions are combining for -0.6 fWAR. That's not so good."
NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,gometrule,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"If we're not going to acquire anyone, I'd rather see us sell Niese and Murphy then do nothing. Go all in next year."

Every single batter has been dragged down but the team's slump and it's hard to point to anyone who hasn't been affected. I do feel that if they brought in a new bat, and that guy started getting hits where other guys hadn't, it could rub off on the others and might help them start to turn things around.

Wilpons are cheap (Madoff???) and won't sign anyone who can hit. They are still paying Bonilla more than anyone on starting staff. Now deGrom and Syndagard have to do three things: 1. throw a shut out 2. Eat up innings 3. Go 2 for 4 with three ribbies.
NewYorkMets,3e2vd6,Revcrashdavis,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:53 2015 UTC,The Bonilla thing is overblown. Plenty of teams do that. He's being paid like $1 mil a year

NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,CFSparta92,32,Tue Jul 21 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently I'm one of the more vocal people who believe it isn't a good idea to rush prospects, I'm going to make the same mistake I did two nights ago and pose a counter argument. I am prepared (unlike last time) to be dogged, hated, and burried with an ad hominem or two.  Calling him up from AA is sort of a new idea in the past few years. After seeing baseball's youth movement, maybe GM's have started to call guys up earlier and earlier. This is insane. I am going to take the traditionalist stance here (or the stance everyone believed in Pre-Trout) and say a player needs to prove himself at all levels of the game. Since the draft there have been flukes (I don't think Travis Wood even went to the minors) but, as it has always been, a player spent however long in A, then AA and so on.  Then Buxton was called straight from Chattanooga. (Not only did I personally piss me off) it also seemed weird to skip AAA, which is now seen as the home for all AAAA players and no prospects. And yet, Trout, Bryant, and Harper (I think, could be wrong about Harper) all spent a wee bit of time in AAA.  Maybe Sandy stalls prospects. Maybe he is too over cautious- I mean from my perspective Syndergaard was just getting harrased by the Vegas climate last year and needed to be promoted.   Yeah, that brings me to Vegas. Its a shit hole. Conforto could probably hit the ball a mile there. But there are no garuntees about that.  Look, those AAAA players you mentioned might seem like trash to fans, and they might be infurated by their play, but not everyone can be a star. No team can have 25 stars- even the Royals have Infante, the Cardinals Kozma and the Yankees Steven Drew. It irritates the fanbase.   Here is one thing Neuiwneheis (or however the fuck you spell his name) or Campbell has over Conforto- experience!  They can adapt! Not well, mind you, but still adapt to pitching. Conforto would probably hit gangbusters like Joc if Conforto was called up tommorow. In a few weeks /r/baseball would be drooling over his guts.  And maybe he continues this torrid pase like Trout. But keep this in mind- the Sophmore Slump isn't some dumb wives tail, it exists. When the league finds the holes in Conforto's swing, they will demolish him. Then, he will have to pick himself out of the dirt, dust off, and get back in the box.  If he gets called up from AA he might not yet have had the training to do that. Fuck mindset or whatever-he might get into a slump both physically and mentally and never recover. Like you said. I think that is what will happen with Joc Pederson, but that's another story.  Truthfully, its July. If you don't want to morgage the future like you said, promote Conforto to AAA. See how he does.  When the Rosters expand to 40 on September First, call him and Nimmo and Cecchni up. Unless there is another bad injury before then.   Its frustrating to watch a team with a great prospect in the wings fail in that position. But frankly, you are looking at Conforto's ceiling.   Never overvalue your prospects. You were blessed to find both Syndergaard, DeGrom and Harvey."

NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,frakking-anustart,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"I think the main counterpoint to your argument, while informed and certainly not invalid, is that the point of the minors is to develop prospects and make them ready for the majors. You mentioned not rushing Conforto. What about his game, other than simply garnering reps in AA and AAA, needs refinement before he gets called up to the majors? The main attraction to a fast promotion is that he's a polished hitter from being drafted out of college, so in terms of coaching there's not a lot left to teach and develop until he faces major league opposition.   He'll certainly have to take his lumps and it's far from a guarantee he'll be able to come up and rake immediately. Hell, it's entirely possible bordering on likely that he'd come up, struggle/not contribute significantly, and then be sent back down. So what? The Mets called up Dilson Herrera to play 2B when it was clear that there was a need for him. He wasn't ready for the majors just yet but showed promise and upside, and was able to give fans a glimpse of his potential before being sent back down to Vegas to continue polishing his game.   Why is the front office so terrified to do the same with Conforto? It's literally the exact same situation. Cuddyer lands on the DL. Using some godforsaken platoon of Grandy/Lagares/Ceciliani/Mayberry/Campbell in the outfield just isn't going to cut it. At least sampling Conforto in the majors to see what's there, then easily optioning him back to Vegas (where his confidence is bordering on impossible to be shaken given his performance thus far as well as the hitter's paradise of the PCL) if he doesn't perform is almost a zero-risk situation.   For a team with as frugal a front office as the Mets have, avoiding an in-house promotion of a potential difference-making prospect just seems so ridiculous to me."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,WhateverandEverAmen2,4,Tue Jul 21 07:39:47 2015 UTC,Conforto needs a lot of work on three things from what I can tell.    Pulling inside cheese Laying off lefty off speed pitches getting much better routes in the outfield.    That alone is enough reason to give him some AAA time IMO.

Since the draft there have been flukes (I don't think Travis Wood even went to the minors) but, as it has always been, a player spent however long in A, then AA and so on.   Pujols skipped AA entirely and played 3 games in AAA. Barry bonds skipped AA and played 40 games at AAA. Vlad Guerrero  skipped AAA entirely. Frank Thomas skipped AAA. Before 2000 or ao, AA was the level most elite prospects were at. AAA was for mlb depth and journeymen. Guys who could be called up and down and it wouldnt affect them. If they played at AAA. It wasnt for long. Now you see the extra  seasoning excuse. But really they want to delay service time as much as possible now.  For the Mets, most of their guys in the minors will have stats closer to Binghamton than Vegas. Vegas is a ridiculous hitters park. Citi is a pitchers park. Conforto can hit the same way at AA than he does here  (attack the gaps and such). In vegas those gap doubles become HRs."

NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,frakking-anustart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Look if you want to go all in now and fuck the future, sure do whatever and call Conforto up now. But once those pitchers that saw him in August and July see him again next April and May, it will be harder on any player to adjust. Pitchers adapt quickly in the majors and find holes quickly. Every swing has a glitch or hole in it- even Trout's. Conforto, if he doesn't have enough expedience of adapting, might be great at first but horrible next year.   So if you want to win now, risk the possibility of ruining him for the future. I mean who cares anyway, to turn Conforto into the next Neiwenheus"
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,bmd4567,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:11 2015 UTC,Lol Kirk never had the potential and skill of Conforto. Do you think every prospect is ruined once they reach the majors?
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,thestral_rider,5,Tue Jul 21 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will tell you that strawberry would have been an HOFer if the Mets let him develop some more in the minors instead of making him rely on raw skills in flushing. There's a similar argument to be made about Ike Davis, who while likely never developing into a HOF player, would have been more consistent in the majors had he gotten more than four months in the minors.  This front office wants to have fully developed guys in the majors. First, it means they're more likely to reach their full potential, and second, it means that the years of team control cover more prime years. I'm going to argue that Conforto is being kept down in AA because there is a heavy instructional component to his day to day activities that is easier to complete in the Catskills than the middle of a desert or in Queens. Because he's so much better than the competition, he can focus the bulk of his efforts on the instructional work that the Mets hope will turn him into a perennial all-star. If he's in AAA, then he has to deal with the heat, and if he's on the 25 man roster, he has to worry about performing against the world's best players, which would take away from his ability to complete his instructional work.  It's my belief that the front office is waiting for him to complete this instructional work before calling him up."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,JuniorSwingman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:56 2015 UTC,"Ike Davis had the ankle injury in Colorado that has crippled his career. He hasn't been the same since that injury. IMO it wasn't lack of development, just a freak injury that he wasn't able to overcome."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,thestral_rider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that the ankle injury really hurt his career, but the second half that made us all think there was still hope he was the franchise first baseman came after the ankle injury. I'm going to suggest that more time developing in the farm system would have given him the ability to be more consistent at the plate."

NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,Djburnunit,3,Tue Jul 21 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"The argument can be made both ways because it's worked both ways. There are players who have made the jump and it's worked out, there are others who haven't. So sorry, but I can't make an argument that couldn't be countered.  Would Conforto make a difference? That's the question I have. The offense is so uniformly terrible right now I'm not convinced Trout in the 3- or 4-hole would help.  Yes, I'm exaggerating with that last thought, but it does underline my point that the Mets don't have a ""missing piece"" – they have a missing offense. Having Conforto jump two levels in an insanely press-heavy mega-market is challenging enough – but to also look for him to make the difference between making the post-season or not?   I'm of the mindset that the current offense has to get its shit together or there won't be a post-season. It's getting old to see the pitcher provide the sole run support."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,shydominantdave,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:09 2015 UTC,Gary definitely seemed to be advocating for it before the all-star break.
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,dumbego,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"I would rather see Conforto get seasoning playing every day on a solid minor league team than play less regularly and be exposed in this dumpster fire of a lineup. If they can acquire an extra bat or two to make the lineup not a complete mess, then I'd be more in favor of it."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,giobbistar21,3,Tue Jul 21 12:40:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going to start with this: Michael Conforto does belong in the majors this year, HOWEVER... He doesn't belong in the majors now. The thing about college players is that while they are more advanced than prep players, they, like prep players need seasoning. Sure, Conforto can hit, but in the majors, unless you're a DH, you need more dimension to your game than being a hitter. People could point to Conforto in the Futures game, particularly the highlight where he gunned down the runner at home and mindlessly yell ""Call him up"", but that's just one throw. Unless Conforto can show that he's consistent with his defense, I think we hold off.   What's more is that AA isn't exactly what you call top competition. Sure, pitchers start to throw secondary stuff, but it's a lot less commonplace than in AAA, when you have on-the-cusp and former major leaguers playing against you. Those guys are the key to you showing that you can make it. If you can beat a guy who played in the majors and who has more than just a fastball, then great, you can prove yourself. The one thing that people continually point out is that Las Vegas is probably the worst place to develop a player because the dry climate unfairly benefits hitters while hampering pitchers. In case these people have forgotten, the 51's don't play their entire AAA schedule in Las Vegas. There are other climates to play in too, climates which more accurately mimic optimal conditions for pitchers and reasonable environments for hitters. It's like Dom Smith and Brandon Nimmo in Savannah, the climate is terrible for hitters and excellent for pitchers, but because there are road games, prospects who play for the Sand Gnats are allowed to show that Savannah hasn't completely screwed their mechanics and mindset.   I think another problem here is that hitters are an entirely different animal for Alderson. He's used to developing pitchers, and knows the timetable for them, 2 years max for college pitchers, 5 years max for high school pitchers. Plawecki took almost three years to call up because he needed to add more dimension to his game than just being a solid contact hitter. And it's showing because pitchers have adapted to him, and he's trying to figure out how to show that he can stay.   The solution here is that Conforto, while not called up now, can be called upon when rosters expand in September. I'll explain that. If he's called up now, he has little room for error, and if he falters, it's going to have a detrimental effect both on him and the team. In September, he has a little more wiggle room because his addition is essentially a complement to the roster. Have him take an AB at a time, if he shows he can handle it, then give him more responsibility, but if not, at least you have a small enough sample size that it shouldn't fuck with his head too much."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,Sef_Maul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:20 2015 UTC,It sounds cliche to say it but the kid needs his regular reps. We can't bring him up and throw him in a platoon. He does need to be in Vegas though and i'd like to see him up for a cup of coffee in September.
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,davos_shorthand,2,Tue Jul 21 06:51:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really see that being an issue. Even if Cuddyer stays off the DL this week, he's shown that he plays best with frequent rest. Conforto could start 3/4 of their games between right and left field, with Cuddy rotating onto the bench and 1B on Duda rest days and Grandy getting some rest."
NewYorkMets,3e1cdu,Capon3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm all for bringing him up. What most people are forgetting also, is that he is a college prospect, he's not 18. I remember hearing the Mets say they drafted him cause he was the most polished college bat in the draft, so he wouldn't need a ton of seasoning  and make it to the majors soon. Well that point is here, and he's tearing up AA. So once again the Mets tell us one thing, then crash the car."

NewYorkMets,3e2uvt,roby6907,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"Because he had one good hitting season in AAA. Reynold's is not a good player and his future lies in being a utility player. He's hitting .270 in Vegas, where players like Kirk and Campbell look like Hall of Famers.  But people will continue bringing up his ranking as a ""top"" prospect and blowing that hard in everyone's faces."
NewYorkMets,3e2uvt,JKaye57,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. Reynolds doesn't look like a major league starter, so I don't see why we wouldn't be willing to trade him for a solid bench or platoon piece"
NewYorkMets,3e2uvt,roby6907,0,Tue Jul 21 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"And what alternative would you propose? We have enough shortstop prospects to handle losing Reynolds, and frankly, the AAA players should stay in AAA. If you want to compete now, you can't expect to succeed with video game trades. You have to give up assets that a team likes in order to get the player you want."

NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,MattHarveysDip,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:08 2015 UTC,Having the Wilpons as owners means valuing making worth out of spent money over valuing winning. It's pretty fucking pathetic. Alex Torres should have been DFA'ed about five games ago. He's brought in to face lefties when he has reverse splits and he has zero control and is shitty against everyone regardless of their side of the plate. He is a terrible reliever and should not be pitching for the Mets. The fact that Verrett who was pitching wonderfully was optioned to AAA over him is proof of how much this penny-pinching organization values saving money over success and it's awful.

NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,joeydeno,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just addressing the position players since our pitching hasn't been much of a problem outside of mario being a constant fuck-up. But I absolutely agree, he's been terrible and it is downright criminal that he held onto his roster spot when Verrett got sent down after being lights out for us."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,BillW87,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:22:48 2015 UTC,JMJ and A.T really are the only 2 who should just be done with this team. recker and plaw are our best catchers right now and soup has showed that he kinda belongs here a little bit. Soup and recker deserve to be on this team more then A.T JMJ just my opinion
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,joeydeno,9,Tue Jul 21 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"Eric Campbell is hitting .174 with a .579 OPS. He has the second worst batting average in the majors and 15th worst OPS out of the 292 MLB players with at least 150 PA. He's also committed 8 errors and played below replacement defense. That's not counting his multiple mental errors that don't get counted in the stats, like getting doubled off when he forgot how many outs there were on a pop fly and kept running thinking there were 2 outs when there was one, not throwing home to prevent a run when he forgot how many outs there were, and not throwing home today to prevent a run during a rundown because he forgot to pay attention to the runner at third. He absolutely has no place on a major league roster right now."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,BillW87,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:15 2015 UTC,he deserves his spot on this team more then JMJ and A.T. And 8 errors isnt the worst on our team either tho. And mental errors i could say that a couple of other people make a lot of them also but compared to who we have on this roster he deserves his spot more then JMJ or A.T
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,joeydeno,5,Tue Jul 21 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"He has 8 errors in only 330.2 defensive innings. At an error every 44.1 innings that's fucking terrible. For comparison, Wilmer Flores is the only Met with more errors than Campbell but he's only committed an error every 60.0 innings. There's really no way to slice up Campbell's stats to make him not look terrible."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,BillW87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:45 2015 UTC,your right about that but who else would we have on the team instead? Nimmo? who has 20+ errors below the majors. hes the only fit i see right now for this team. he can make decent contact even with the shit average but there is nothing else we can do.
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,joeydeno,4,Tue Jul 21 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"At this point it's pretty much an ""anything would be better"" situation. Since Flores and Tejada both have the same positional flexibility as Campbell we lose nothing by swapping him for another bat. Herrera's been tearing it up in AAA and I don't see how he'd be worse than Soup. Even struggling at the plate Herrera was hitting 30 points better than Soup and plays significantly better defense. Tovar can't hit for shit, but neither can Soup and Tovar is a near-elite defender who can play SS, 3B, and 2B. Muno's struggled at the plate too, but again he's a better defender than Campbell. Again, pretty much anything would be an improvement at this point. There's only so long we can keep running a .174 hitter up in the lineup and expect our offense not to suffer for it."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,BillW87,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:33 2015 UTC,"It is unfortunate. The Gnats also played fantastic defense today which really creates a negative synergy and makes our offense look even worse. John Mayberry Jr. and Soup came just about as close to two run doubles as you can without succeeding. Hard hit balls that were just inches away from radically changing the game. I don't want to go crazy playing the what-if game though, it was certainly disheartening to see the Mets stumble out of the gates in an important one."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,MattHarveysDip,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"Eric Campbell also has the second worst batting average in the majors among the 298 players with at least 150 PA. He'd still be third on that list even with those two hits. As much as we caught some bad breaks tonight, we also fielded a really really shitty lineup too."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,BillW87,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to redeem their performances or defend them. I was more commenting on why watching them struggle felt worse. Even our ""dumb luck"" doubles didn't fall in and as you said, we fielded a really really really shitty lineup too."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,MattHarveysDip,0,Tue Jul 21 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, the lineup is just a sad thing to look at.  Go grab a Marlon Byrd or Ben Zobrist, Justin Upton or Mark Trumbo, just something.  I was at the game on Friday, and when Mayberry came up with a chance to tie it with two outs in the ninth, I knew what would happen.  And it sucked because Cards fans are assholes, and I really wanted a chance to stand and cheer.  I wish they FO would at least try something."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,marky30,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"The loss isn't as bad as I thought. I genuinely would have been surprised if the Mets managed to win tonight's game after that 18-inning game against St. Louis on Sunday. The Mets kept fighting hard but have just been unable to cash in those runners due to the excellent defense displayed by the Nationals and the inopportune moments. Also, Alex Torres simply needs to go, regardless of whether it is to DFA or to AAA. While he wasn't really the source of the team's loss, he has been trouble for quite some time. He just can't be trusted at times. I don't know if the same can be said for Mayberry but he hasn't been hitting well. He has been below the Mendoza line for quite some time. If the Mets can win the next two games and force a split on the road trip at 3-3, I would call it a successful road trip."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,petezahut93,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:12 2015 UTC,This shit suuuuucks.
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,islesandpizza,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"People say it's crazy that the Mets' pitchers are the only one driving in runs but really is it? Of all the players on the roster the starting pitchers are bonafide major leaguers look at the line up today there were 5 guys I would consider AAAA players. They literally can't score because they are being asked to do something they can't, produce at the major league level. Maybe if the Mets took a different approach to the bench instead of declaring it ""The best the Las vegas 51's has to offer"" we would be able to survive injuries to our starting players. But that isn't the case. We had capable players at the Major league level but since they went down everyone was moved up on the depth chart and it has resulted in some of the worst offensive output in franchise history."
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,CarBacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:51 2015 UTC,A popular debate on here and the NY sports radio waves is who to start in a one-game playoff: Harvey or deGrom. We'll find out tomorrow who wins that one. These are the biggest games of the season thus far.
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,jordansideas,6,Tue Jul 21 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"It has to be degrom. The dude has been dominant. I don't care how confident harvey is and how he loves the big moment, if he's not locating his pitches he is not the better option. Frankly I think all this talk about harveys intangibles giving him an ""edge"" is insulting to degrom. Just because he doesn't crave the spotlight like harvey and isn't dating supermodels and posing naked for ESPN doesn't mean the guy isn't a fierce competitor."

We're walking into this stretch thinking we have a shot when our pitchers are responsible for a large chunk of run production.  I am now convinced a single trade won't save us. Duda, Flores, Cuddyer, and Lagares have to go through complete turnarounds if we expect to have a shot.   We are officially on the ropes guys, and yes I understand it's only July, but somebody needs to point out why I should believe this offense is going to stop being this pathetic. And I'm not talking about some useless ""line drive rate"" stat either. I seriously need to be convinced, because right now this lineup looks all but hopeless..."

They got a lot of hits and if we had gotten a little more luck this could have been a close game. Lets hope deGrom throws a gem tomorrow and then we can take the series on Wednesday"
NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,kittypokemon,2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:27 2015 UTC,tbh the game was good even tho we were losing by 5 at 1 point but harvey got his shit together. the thing that just fucked us over and killed momentum into tomorrow is A.T giving up that 2 run shot. Hell the thing that killed the momentum was bringing him in to pitch in the 1st place

NewYorkMets,3e0sgj,joeydeno,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:32 2015 UTC,and to be completely honest if this org needs to make some money all they need to do is make a heart break card. the only thing would be is a picture of the score board of the mets winning in b9 (3-2 or a close game) and on the mound is alex torres. that card would be a best seller because he sure knows how to fuck with the feelings of fans for this team.

NewYorkMets,3dzi7h,LarryLove,9,Mon Jul 20 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"I love telling this story, not mine and it is about the NY Giants, but team lighters always remind me of this.  So my friend (diehard Giants fan) moves to Boulder, CO from NY in 1998 and buys a lighter with his pack of cigarettes. When he gets to his car, he pulls out the lighter ""WTF? It's a Broncos lighter. Fuck that shit!"" But, of course, he keeps it around. It's a lighter, after all, and he needs it for cigarettes and we. . .well, other things that are now legal there.  All of a sudden it's game 10 of the season, Denver is undefeated and the lighter just keeps going. My friend casually mentions this to me, after telling me the story about how he accidentally bought it months earlier, and I say ""That's a hell of a long time for you to keep a lighter and not use it or lose it. It is special."" ""Huh, yeah, you're right.""  So now it is coming up on game 14, they are still undefeated and the Giants are coming into town. He calls me freaking out ""EatATaco! The lighter is STILL going, and they are playing the Giants this week. What do I do?"" I say, jokingly, ""you gotta legitimately kill that thing. You can't throw it out or just let it burn out, you actually have to use it up lighting things.""  So, according to him, for the next week he brings it everywhere and offers it to everyone when they are lighting something. All types of smoking, even people lighting cigs on the street, he would run up and offer. Still, the night before the game, it is still going strong.  So that night, he buys a big bag of something that is now legal there and proceeds to smoke all night. He calls me at 4 am (why he thought that was a good idea, I have no idea. .. well, I do, but that's besides the point, i was still pissed), to let me know that the Giants were going to win because he had finally killed the lighter. He then started babbling about some other stuff that I didn't understand. I was tired and he wasn't even remotely sober.  And the Giants ended their streak that day. We still joke about how killing that lighter won the game for the Giants.  And I hope your lighter is magical too. Just don't kill it between now and the game, please."

I don't think we need to acquire an arm for the sake of having it. In case you've forgotten, we have enough arms on call at AAA not to mention guys who will come off the DL soon. Plus, I feel that we should really give Gilmartin more of a shot. I mean seriously, this guy's been a really reliable asset as a Rule 5 guy."
NewYorkMets,3e2u10,giobbistar21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"I like Gilmartin, but it's good to have 2 dependable lefties in the pen.

NewYorkMets,3e2u10,giobbistar21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Because no GM is willing to admit he made a mistake unless it totally backfired on him. See Jed Hoyer.
NewYorkMets,3e2u10,JKaye57,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"For what we got for Torres, I don't think it was a bad deal. The fact is, I don't think Torres is THAT bad. I think he's been insanely mishandled by Terry.   Looking at his splits, we all know Torres is awful against lefties. They're hitting .294 against him with a .869 OPS. Right handed hitters though? .169. The only downside is that Torres still walks a lot of hitters, and when righty's do make contact, he's given up 4 home runs to them.  We don't have a traditional bullpen structure when it comes to lefties. In small sample sizes, both Robles and Parnell have been productive against lefties. When Robles has pitched against lefties, he's been a lot less wild as well.  For as good as our bullpen has been, we could be even better if certain pitchers were used differently."

It's much more likely that a guy hitting balls hard will find holes and get hits.

NewYorkMets,3e2jyn,kickthepony,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:45 2015 UTC,Nope. No sarcasm here. And I dont care about mixed replies. If you wanna watch this offense perform the way it has feel free to. If you wanna live in fairy tale land and think that injuries were the sole issue then go ahead. If you wanna believe that Sandy couldnt do anything about it go ahead also.  I dont care anymore.
NewYorkMets,3e2jyn,here2red,4,Tue Jul 21 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"I try to not insult people in debate but you are completely delusional.  Sandy is responsible for:   trading Beltran's expiring contract for Zack Wheeler trading RA Dickey's expiring contract for TDA, Thor, and Wuilmer Becerra  trading Marlon Byrd's expiring contract for Dilson Herrera and Vic Black trading Ike Davis for Blake Taylor  trading den Dekker for Jerry Blevins picking Duda over Davis at 1B signed Granderson and Colon drafted Conforto, Nimmo, Gsellman, Fulmer, Cecchini, Plawecki, Reynolds, Dom Smith, Meisner, Guillorme   Sandy's only real mistake as a GM was signing Cuddyer instead of Aoki, and that is a minor mistake overshadowed by a half decade of savvy moves.   He's being patient and not rushing to panic moves cause Redditors want him to. Successful franchises are patient and let their teams develop over several years, like the Cardinals, Pirates, Royals, Giants, etc. It's not easy to wait, but when this all comes together it's gonna be fucking sweet"

As for trading the vets for the prospects, yeah no doubt. He is very very good at that. That is his specialty, restocking a farm system. Sandy's ""real mistake"" is something he doesnt seem to know how to do vice versa. Trading talent from the farm system into vets that can help the major league team. Which is now killing the team every single night.   So he can now come up with his cute little quips like Panic City to describe the media if he wishes. But while the pitchers pitch their hearts out with 2 or 3 runs given up mostly. This offense does practically nothing every single night. And watch the team drop behind the Nats further and further out of the playoff race."

NewYorkMets,3dy83w,Metsican,10,Tue Jul 21 13:12:41 2015 UTC,Notice how the new infield has helped him out nicely
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,halvin_and_cobbes,6,Mon Jul 20 15:56:00 2015 UTC,This is exactly what has been helping Jon and should not be discounted. He's a contact pitcher that relies on the other 8 guys making plays. He can't bear down a strike out a guy in a tight spot. He needs that ground ball and now the infield is crisply making plays behind him.
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,duyogurt,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"He's definitely thrown some nasty curveballs to strike out some people in big spots this season, but he can't do it consistently like our other pitchers can."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,Dazeq,3,Mon Jul 20 21:53:40 2015 UTC,"It's not that he can't. It's just not his game. Harvey, deGrom, etc can go for the strikeout. I don't think Niese can. He tries to jam big bitters, break their bats and induce a double play. I think Jon caught a ton of flack that was not entirely his fault during his skid."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,duyogurt,17,Mon Jul 20 22:29:55 2015 UTC,But can he hit?
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,mattjaydunn,16,Mon Jul 20 14:42:49 2015 UTC,.182 avg puts him above Colon and Harvey. Syndergaard and deGrom lead Met starters in BA.

NewYorkMets,3dy83w,seandan317,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:03 2015 UTC,This is a situation where strikeout numbers are irrelevant.  Outs are outs and it rarely matters if it is by k or pop out.

NewYorkMets,3dy83w,caldera15,5,Mon Jul 20 16:04:06 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see who this allows us to trade for.
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,aaronwe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"Trading Niese now would be a bad move, imo. Maybe it's just cause I live in Boston and follow the Sox nightmare of a rotation but our pitching depth is what has allowed us to stay in contention in spite of our atrocious offense. We take it for granted, especially when you have injuries to guys like Matz. I'm not against moving Niese altogether but the time to do it is in the offseason or even next year after Wheeler returns. Not now where we are trying to compete and our pitching is the only reason we can. The exception would be if moving him gets us an impact bat like Upton, which I doubt could happen."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,caldera15,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:26 2015 UTC,I guess we can compare this Dickey...We will never get more for Niese than we will at this trade deadline.
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,aaronwe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"except we weren't planning to compete in 2013 for a playoff spot. We were rebuilding for a year like now, where we are trying to compete.   Also Niese is fairly consistent. His FIP is up a little this year but he's getting results. Barring an injury there is no reason to think his value will go down that much between now and this offseason."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,Metsican,2,Mon Jul 20 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"and we need a bat, and Niese may be the piece that moves for the bat..."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,the_furry_stoner,0,Mon Jul 20 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's a fun time to note, though, that we could have traded Niese for the same package as Dickey brought because Alex Anthopolous liked him that much."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,caldera15,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"Niese is only 28 as well. He's a lefty and a team like San Diego or Milwaukee could use him and maybe Nimmo. That may not land us Upton but that at least gets us in the door for any of the big guns without immediately coughing up a big part of our future rotation. Niese, Nimmo, and Montero are a nice trio to land for any team that needs pitching and a young OF prospect. I could see us taking someone expensive like Upton or Gomez for not much more than that. I'd even throw in any of our other prospects so long as they aren't named Conforto or Dilson. If Matz can stay healthy we have a very good rotation. Bartolo is our glaring weak spot and I'm ok with that in a number 5 guy. I'm also ok trying to grab some prospects for just Niese. His value is just too high to keep right now, especially since he has no place in our future plans."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,the_furry_stoner,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Niese, Nimmo, and Montero    For a package like that I'd much rather have Gomez than less than half a season of Upton. He's more consistent and under contract. I'd throw money at Upton in the offseason but I wouldn't give up much cost controlled talent. Niese is under contract for an affordable price till 2018. We may take it for granted given our pitching depth but that's a lot of value, we should get more than a rental in return for it. Especially considering he's a lefty."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,Metsican,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"I said below that a trio of Niese, Nimmo, and Montero should be very attractive for any team that needs pitching and a young OF prospect. Nimmo and Montero are very cheap with great upside and Niese is relatively cheap and would do well in a pitchers park like Petco or Miller. Throw in one Rosario, Reynolds, Ceccini, or Molina and there's a possible deal.  Niese, Rosario, Nimmo, Montero and PTBNL for Carlos Gonzalez and Segura? I would take just Carlos too. We need a bat in the worst way. An OF of Gonzalez, Juan, and Conforto would be an ideal 2016. Having Gonzalez, Juan, and Grandy/Cuddy for the rest of this year is a massive improvement."
NewYorkMets,3dy83w,DerpinDan442,0,Mon Jul 20 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"Hold on a sec. I can understand acquiring Carlos Gonzalez (the Rockie you referred to in your post) but Segura's not a better player than Tejada. He had a few good weeks as a rookie. Let's kill that myth now. If you're talking about Carlos Gómez, I'd be looking for higher impact pieces than those guys.  I'd be asking for Conforto and Fulmer. We'd probably be able to keep Conforto but we'd probably have to give up Fulmer, who is a much better pitching prospect than Niese or Montero."

NewYorkMets,3e1hp5,BarristanSelfie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"This just seems like more unfounded accusations. Wright had a pretty serious back injury coupled with some unfavorable genetics. Cuddy was injured AF even before becoming a Met, and he's old.

Meisner looks really solid so far for only 20 years old and I think there's a lot of potential growth in his K/9 numbers too as he develops. It's nice to have a new pitching prospect to get hyped over after we've cleared out all of the big gun arms from the minors over the last few years.

NewYorkMets,3dya7s,Desertstarr,21,Mon Jul 20 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"God, when we signed him I never thought in a million years I would be this attached to Bartolo. I love watching him pitch, because you can just see how much he loves to be out there and I really am glad I got to see him on Opening Day."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,kickthepony,8,Mon Jul 20 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Man I'm laughing/crying so hard at ""Steven Latz""."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,mattjaydunn,8,Mon Jul 20 18:40:37 2015 UTC,Familia couldn't believe it when Colon handed him a piece of paper and told him to go to this address. It was a tailor near Grand Central Station. Colon had ordered three suits for him.   That one got me.
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,gynoceros,7,Mon Jul 20 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"I loved the move when it happened because he'd come off an 18 win season (I think it was 18) but I never expected him to turn out the way he did. He has not failed to put a smile on my face day in and day out and I still have vivid memory of being absolutely blown away by his command in his first few starts last season, just because before all the young guns I don't think our staff had the best control. Great guy, hope he pitches until he's 70. Hail Bartolo."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,mattjaydunn,11,Mon Jul 20 15:46:07 2015 UTC,I'm gonna bawl when he leaves. Bartolo is the G.O.A.T and anyone who says otherwise is just denying themselves.
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,giobbistar21,5,Mon Jul 20 15:36:38 2015 UTC,The thing with Familia and the suits got me. I wanna hang out with Bartolo. He seems like an amazing guy.
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,islesandpizza,4,Mon Jul 20 20:27:34 2015 UTC,I love Bartolo. It will truly be a sad day when he moves on from the Mets. I can't wait to see him develop as a manager or pitching coach. He's got the pedigree to be a difference maker on the managerial side of baseball.
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,CFSparta92,6,Mon Jul 20 21:02:49 2015 UTC,I love this guy so much. He truly loves the game. He could be terrible and I'd still want him on the team.    He will be missed.     ;_;
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,stb91,-11,Mon Jul 20 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"I'll probably be banned for this sentiment, but when Colon comes off the books after this year, good riddance.    On a cash strapped team, it's hard to justify allocating 10% of payroll on a 42 year old with a 6.00 ERA since May 10th just because he makes you laugh a couple of times a game in his trials and tribulations at the plate.  Of course,  I can acknowledge that his presence might be priceless for some of the younger pitchers, but this team needs more than an $11 million circus act."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,absolutely0life,5,Mon Jul 20 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"Cmon, you can't cherry pick stats like that unless there's a legitimate reason, and trying to make him look as bad as possible is not that reason. You especially can't just look at ERA in this instance because he has a 3.84 FIP. It's practically impossible to maintain a .340 BABIP and a 59.1 LOB%. Both those numbers are extremely unsustainable. Besides, he was absolutely dominant before then; why don't those starts count? He still has a 3.55 FIP on the year."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,Senor_Met,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think that pointing out the fact that a pitcher who comprises 10% of this team's payroll has pitched poorly the past two months is necessarily cherry picking stats.  We can talk about FIP and bad luck all we want, but Colon will generally have a relatively low FIP since he doesn't walk anyone.  FIP doesn't account for the rockets that one hop the wall that he's been giving up recently.  And even if/when the BABIP and LOB% come back to normal, that's still $11 million going toward a best case quality start every 5th day.  And RE: Colon's early season dominance.  Not for nothing, but I don't remember anyone citing Niese's dominant start to the season when people were calling for his head before his most recent strong stretch.  This is a 'what have you done for me lately' town, apparently unless it applies to Bart."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,absolutely0life,4,Mon Jul 20 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"In terms of the WAR to dollar ratio, Colon has actually been a steal. He was worth $21M, the entire cost of his contract, just last year alone. He's been worth $13M already this year, and we're not even 2/3 of the way through. Paying him $11M this year is a very good deal.   And when was Niese dominant this season? Regardless, you're applying the opinions of the sub on to me, and I tend not to be as reactionary as most people here."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,Senor_Met,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"If we're going to refer to Colon's first 6 starts as dominant, then surely we must consider Niese's sub-2 ERA over the same span dominant as well.    And if Colon continues pitching as he has, we may have to revisit just how much he's been worth this year. And yeah, fWAR says he's been worth his money.  Meanwhile, bWAR says he's been an absolute waste of money. (-.2 WAR over the life of his contract).  I know some people who swear by fWAR for pitchers and others who swear by pitcher bWAR.  In Colon's case, depending on which you look at vastly changes the picture we're looking it.  So, I think it's a little unfair to cite one of them as to why he's a steal while eschewing the other which asserts the opposite.  I didn't mean to apply the opinions of the sub to you, and I don't think I even did. I just cited the fact that no one was talking about Niese's start during his rough stretch.  I'm sorry if it sounded different."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,absolutely0life,4,Mon Jul 20 18:57:23 2015 UTC,Just read this post by /u/BillW87 from a month ago HERE
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,JuniorSwingman,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"That's intriguing when looking at Colon's entire body of work.  But still, since May 10th, he has made 11 starts, 6 of which were QS.  The Mets only won 3 of those starts (not his fault). But over that same span, he made 5 starts in which he gave his team virtually no chance to win the game.    At this point, Colon gives his team a chance to win by scoring a few runs (a tall order) about half the time.  The other half, he's essentially noncompetitive."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,absolutely0life,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"Meh. He generally pitches better than his ERA (see the linked post that Swingman hooked you up with) and he generally (save for against St Louis) puts you in a good spot to win the game. He has been shaky lately, but so has Cole Hamels, MadBum and Lester (although Lester is coming out of it). It happens with pitchers. Bart will be fine, win 15 games and laugh in the face of youth. With his almost coach like presence, you pay him 11 mil and smile."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,Rules_row,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'm more than happy to kick back and watch the show when he's pitching to his normal 4.50 ERA (basically a quality start every outing).  But no matter how you want to slice and dice it, the guy has a 6.00 ERA over the past two months.  I'm really hoping he turns it around, but I guess I'm just surprised how quickly everyone is to defend Colon.  I'd venture a guess that if Niese had a 6.00 ERA over the past 2+ months, no one would be rushing to his defense."
NewYorkMets,3dya7s,absolutely0life,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"You would be right about the Niese assumption, but they are two different beasts.  Niese is not an adviser to the rotation like Colon. Niese has only been with the Mets. Colon has traveled, won a Cy young, been suspended, made a come back. Colon adds life experience to the team of young pitchers who in essence need to be groomed to pitch in ny and pitch well. Is 11 mill for a player like that a lot or a little?  What are we paying Collins to sit there and advise?  I think for what he has added not only on the field or off it is worth it.  Plus the final merit of a player is if they put seats in the park and add notoriety and interest to a team, because that leads to a cash return.  I think that proves he has been worth it."
NewYorkMets,3dysbb,Lightfiend,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"In troubled times, our solace is that we have Keith.  Oh Ancient Aztec God of Broadcasting, how may we serve you?"

NewYorkMets,3dy48d,the_nog,9,Mon Jul 20 14:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Maybe it's because their heads are so far up their own asses they just don't care enough to learn about other teams, especially the Mets."

Makes for an entertaining listen."
NewYorkMets,3dy48d,Ahabs_Peg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:18 2015 UTC,We’re spoiled – I’ve had to stream broadcasts from a couple of opposing teams (Giants & DBacks come to mind specifically) and was not at all impressed. Even without any bias they were just flat and dull with very little insight.
NewYorkMets,3dy48d,SiddFinch33,0,Mon Jul 20 19:06:56 2015 UTC,Yeah Keith is really great. Ron and Gary too.  Watching games with other announcers is almost always disappointing.
NewYorkMets,3e0be6,ggslovin,3,Mon Jul 20 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"As of now, it looks like you will be seeing Niese.  This is the Mets though so someone might randomly get injured getting out of bed tomorrow or we might go back to a 6 man rotation yet again so you never know 100%.  But as of now Jon Niese is written in pencil. Shake Shack is a pretty big attraction.  Line is normally pretty long though.  If your a big baseball fan then maybe check out the Mets Hall of Fame, if that interests you at all.  It takes ~10 min to get through the whole thing and you pass by it when you walk into the stadium. Personally my friends and I buy the cheapest tix and just move either lower or to the upper deck behind home plate.  You can expect more people at a Friday game though, so be careful if you take this strategy.  Lastly there are 3 'clubs' at Citi Field.  I don't know if other stadiums do this but these clubs are really just VIP restaurants and there is security standing there to check your ticket.  Someone else might chime in and explain further but the way you get access to these clubs is it just says it on the ticket.  Not sure if they advertise as such on Stub Hub.  These 'clubs' aren't a big loss if you can't get in, but they are nice A/C areas with fewer lines for food/drinks."
NewYorkMets,3e0be6,Empire48,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:32 2015 UTC,I like the Pat LaFrieda filet mignon steak sandwich and the elote corn from El Verano Taqueria. The most food for your buck might be the sandwiches from Mama's of Corona in the Worlds Fare Market. First timers to Citi Field can get a first game certificate from the fan information booth. I also recommend getting the game notes from this booth as well. And you can get a free soda if you sign up to be a designated driver.
NewYorkMets,3e0be6,Blue387,2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure you visit the area behind center field. It the center is a bar that serves really diverse craft beers. Huge selection in there. Also recommend margaritas and the spanish food place in the same area. Shake Shack and Pat LaFrieda's are also there. If you want Shake Shack, go in the 5th.   Then in the RF corner on the same level they have a few more food options and the holy grail: BACON ON A STICK. It's delicious."
NewYorkMets,3e0be6,shackilj2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:59:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions. And we do have bacon on a stick at U.S. Cellular Field. Food is the one thing the Sox do really well.
NewYorkMets,3e0be6,mattjaydunn,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"One.) Jon Niese is in line to start Friday barring a spot start or rotation shake-up.  Three.) I've always personally liked sitting in the top deck because although it's slightly less intimate you get a fantastic view of everything and it really helps put into perspective just how gorgeous the stadium is, plus it's cheaper. It's up to preference and how much you're willing to spend though."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,splenda806,18,Mon Jul 20 14:03:42 2015 UTC,Nimmo would get us the best return out of the guys I'd be ok with them moving so I'm cool with this
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,Senor_Met,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"I found the statement that 'they won't move him for mediocrity' to be the most interesting part.  What exactly constitutes 'mediocrity?'  In my eyes, swapping Nimmo for 2 months of Zobrist is a mediocre return, but Sandy said he'd be willing to give an above-market return for him.  So, I'm quite confused what a not mediocre return for a package including Nimmo would be.  I don't think a Nimmo/Cecchini/Fulmer package gets Upton."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,absolutely0life,6,Mon Jul 20 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Nimmo, Cecchini and Fulmer gets you Upton, Venable and more.... You think the Padres value the compensation pick for Upton more than they value a top-100 guy, 2 borderline top-100 guys and the ~7-8million in salary relief? Good grief, Charlie Brown...."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,price122290,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"Where have you seen that? If that package gets Upton, I'd be pleasantly surprised. I think Preller has absolutely no idea what he's doing and is looking to make up for his offseason decimation of his own organization.  I haven't seen much speculation as to the type of return Upton might get, but I gotta figure Preller would be reluctant to deal Upton without getting a team's top hitting prospect back."

NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,giobbistar21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"Sandy said he'd overpay, and there will be a bidding war from the Yanks, Giants,  Nationals, Cubs and more for him. Nimmo seems like a legitimate enough swap.   This has nothing to do about the Touki trade because Nimmo isn't Touki and Zob isn't Phil Gosslin."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,frakking-anustart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe if Sandy is still willing to overpay for Zobrist, he'd send Nimmo and a mid level, but not Nimmo and a few blue chips. We're not going to do what we did with Mike Bordick and Melvin Mora again."

NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,kr_24,6,Mon Jul 20 14:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'd be completely for this, especially if it's for Upton or Gomez. I think Nimmo seems like a great guy and is very likable, definitely someone you'd like to have on your ball club in that regard. But I'm not entirely sold that once he gets to the majors that he's going to be anything more than just an average to slightly above average player.  I think Upton seems like the less likely option because he'd essentially be a potential rental. But I thought of this idea of what the Mets could do if they land Upton by the trade deadline. At the end of the season try and sign him, if they can, great. They give him a QO so if he can't be signed, they receive a pick, like they did for Reyes. Then instead use that money on Cespedes to play LF, with the plan to have their future OF of Cespedes, Lagares, Conforto, once Granderson's contract is up. So Cespedes would essentially become Nimmo's replacement and fill that hole left by trading him. If this was something the Mets could do, I'd be very happy and like the team's chances to complete for the remainder of this season, in 2016, and in the future.  EDIT: Sorry, the Mets wouldn't be able to give a QO to Upton. But I'd still be for the trade to get Upton then trying to resign him in the off season or go after Heyward or even Cespedes."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,three_dee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think Nimmo is going to be better than you do, (I think he can be a .350-.375 OBA/10-15 HR CF with average D) but I'm still fine with trading him.  We're going to have a lot of this type of guy emerge over the next several years."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,Desertstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"I think your wrong to think we are just going to produce above average position players for 'the next several years'.     We should make a good trade when it appears, especially for youngish proven talent.  But with that said I am good holding onto and using Free agency as needed."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,three_dee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's a lot more likely that the Mets will produce good players from their farm system, than that really good valuable players will reach free agency and present good value.  Both will happen from time to time, but most good teams are going to lean on their organizations now more than exterior markets, far more so than was ever the case before in the last 40 years.  Most teams have money now and are retaining their good players, and even at the deadline they're reluctant to trade anybody because everybody is still in the race.  If this was 2001 I would have agreed with you... but it's getting harder and harder to find talent from outside your organization."

NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Nimmo does everything pretty good but nothing great, so he could be a decent outfielder but nothing special at this point. His patience and approach at the plate, as well as ability to stay in centerfield, is really the key to making him a worthy hitter and more touted prospect. That's definitely the profile of a guy we should all be okay with trading. The return is what matters, of course."
NewYorkMets,3dy3a8,dejious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"This would be such an awful move for us if we don't get a big bat that is under contract for multiple seasons. What Nimmo projects to be is exactly what we need: Decent batting average, hits for some power, great at getting on base, decent speed and a good outfielder.  I'd do it for Upton but only if we 100% know we will re-sign him."

NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,Senor_Met,13,Mon Jul 20 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"Wilmer can't hit outside pitching. I said it back in April and it still rings true. No major league pitcher with half a brain will throw him an inside-half pitch, which is why he hasn't hit a home run in two years."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,sickgrof,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed that as well. He's getting pitched outside constantly now. He can get his singles on them which is why his average hasn't plummeted but he doesn't get on base nearly enough to not be hitting for power."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,BillW87,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"He just seems to throw his bat out at the outside pitches. It keeps his K% down but when your approach to an entire half of the plate is basically a glorified butcher boy swing there's no way in hell that you're going to see another pitch in your wheelhouse ever again. It seems like a coachable problem, but I'm not sure Long is the right guy to try to fix Wilmer's swing. Maybe they should take advantage of Wilmer's last option year this year to give him a little more time with the AAA coaching staff and bring Herrera back up in the meantime (who has an even .900 OPS in Vegas so far after a 3 for 5 night last night with a triple, and has 3 SB/0 CS in 14 games there since his demotion). After this year they lose the ability to move Wilmer up and down freely if he struggles so if they think he has a problem that needs hands-on coaching now is the time to deal with it."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,Senor_Meth,3,Mon Jul 20 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is, he still hasn't been bad. He's still at a 2 win pace and I don't think Herrera would play any better than him right now, and if he goes down to Vegas he'd probably just end up turning those weak pop ups into homers and wouldn't get fixed. This may have to be something he works out at the major league level."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,Senor_Meth,3,Mon Jul 20 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"Ever since he hit his last home run he has been dreadful, 65 wRC+ since then. In years past it wouldve made sense to hope he figures it out, but now we are in a playoff race and we can't afford to be giving away at bats."

NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,sickgrof,0,Mon Jul 20 17:20:31 2015 UTC,Not til you tell me who you are
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,BarristanSelfie,0,Mon Jul 20 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"Herrera was also playing at a (very small sample size alert, of course) 2 win pace this year even while mired in a deep slump with a 74 wRC+ thanks to the fact that he plays what may arguably become Gold Glove caliber defense at 2B. If we have two guys who are struggling at the plate, I'd rather play the one every day who also plays above average defense at his position too. Flores has looked much more comfortable at 2B defensively than he did at SS but his range is always going to keep him from playing a middle infield position as well defensively as a natural middle infielder."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,armylax20,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:16 2015 UTC,The thing is that extrapolating WAR doesn't always work when it's fueled by really high defensive metrics
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,three_dee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The only reason I say that is because I do think that the defensive metrics so far match up with where he'll end up long term based on his tools/scouting, but normally I wouldn't try to extrapolate a sample size that small if it wasn't extremely consistent with everything else we know about a player. Defensive metrics don't even stabilize until we're looking at multiple seasons of work, but I do think that based on how he scouts with his defensive tools he could be a 1-2 dWAR player as an everyday player once he gets the opportunity which means unless he's hitting well below replacement it's going to be hard for him to avoid producing positive value for the team. He's the flip side to the argument of why players like Cuddyer are such a risk, because if they don't consistently hit above replacement they bleed value through their poor defensive play."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,armylax20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:28:03 2015 UTC,It's cause he only uses his arms on the outside pitches. He does this because his stance is so straight. You usually have to bend your knees and be low to hit outside pitches well.
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,three_dee,0,Tue Jul 21 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm perfectly aware of what the reason is. If only we had some time of person whose job it was to coach our hitters on how to hit."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,three_dee,6,Tue Jul 21 10:07:22 2015 UTC,"Ruben Tejada has a 104 wRC+ since becoming a regular on May 29th (.271/.339/.368 in 174 PA), and that's despite a 2-37 stretch at the end of June/start of July.  Edit: over the same span, Wilmer Flores has hit .251/.284/.359 (82 wRC+) in 176 PA."
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,Armani_Kimbo,7,Mon Jul 20 14:33:02 2015 UTC,remember when this sub was going nuts over Flores outperforming Tulo? Tulo OPS almost .200 higher.
NewYorkMets,3dy2ju,bmd4567,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"remember when this sub was going nuts over Flores outperforming Tulo?   No.   Tulo OPS almost .200 higher.   Well, I mean, disclaimer here: no one's going to argue Flores is better than Tulo.  But this is not a good way to measure it.  Tulo plays at Coors so using flat, raw stats is just wacky.  Tulo and Wilmer have been neck and neck in fWAR all year.  Tulo has pulled away a bit in the last week or so (Tulo 1.5, Wilmer 1.1) but it's not like Tulo has been an MVP candidate and Flores has been awful, which is what it sounds like you're implying."

NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,parst,11,Mon Jul 20 22:12:37 2015 UTC,Conforto is much more polished and has a higher floor
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,Senor_Met,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:33 2015 UTC,This is what I'm curious about.  Where does this opinion come from since the prospect reports disagree.
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,Senor_Met,7,Mon Jul 20 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"What scouting reports say that Nimmo is closer than Conforto? Conforto was the most polished bat in the draft, Nimmo still has stuff left to prove."
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,Senor_Met,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"MLB.com's scouting report puts Nimmo's ETA at 2016, and Conforto at 2017.  The rest of their report is basically describing the same player, with the edge to Nimmo for having two more years of pro playing time.  I'm just curious why everyone jumped on Conforto and seemingly forgot that they have another 22 year old 1st-round pick outfielder that's ranked higher."
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,Undercover_Mop,7,Mon Jul 20 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that ETA was probably from before the season and things change. They're also different players, Conforto is definitely more of a power hitter."
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,BillW87,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:41 2015 UTC,ETA doesn't matter when talking about the better prospect. Most lists have Conforto as a top 50 guy while Nimmo is in the top 100.  The biggest difference between the two is that Conforto is more of a sure thing. He should be a solid hitter in the majors because of how polished he is. He may not become an all star but he should be about a .280-.290 hitter who can hit for some power. Nimmo can become anything from an all star to a bench player. His ability to get on base is great but his overall game still has question marks.
NewYorkMets,3dzzfq,frakking-anustart,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"The prospect reports do agree. The scouting reports credit Conforto for being a more polished, more ready hitter right now but criticize him for his lack of any elite tools. The scouting reports credit Nimmo for his high ceiling due to having a good tool set (including much better defensive range than Conforto, since Conforto's range shoehorns him into LF whereas Nimmo could potentially play anywhere in the OF) but criticize him for being raw and not yet producing results consistent with his tools. The tl;dr is that Conforto has a higher floor due to being a polished college hitter but a lower ceiling due to a perceived lack of elite tools, whereas Nimmo has a lower floor due to a lack of production so far compared to similar high value prospects but a higher ceiling due to a perceived high quality set of tools."

I think Black has the tools to be a good reliever even if his velocity doesn't ever return to full strength, but I think he's going to have a rockier transition than Parnell did before he gets to that point just because he doesn't have the 7 previous seasons of major league experience to fall back on that Parnell did."

NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Rules_row,3,Mon Jul 20 00:41:36 2015 UTC,He was the only reason to keep watching this awful game.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,DepravedMutant,18,Mon Jul 20 03:24:11 2015 UTC,They call me a mets guru
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,dvargas92495,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"But it took them 18 innings, so it's 1.5 runs per 9."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,frotorious,13,Mon Jul 20 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Hard to be to optimistic after that offensive performance, but we get Harvey, deGrom and Syndergaard the next three days. Fuck it, let's take the division."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,mji6980-4,13,Mon Jul 20 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"I need to take a nap.  Great game by Granderson and Tejada. Although it was overly long, a lot of our players shined tonight."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,beckett360,9,Mon Jul 20 00:16:49 2015 UTC,"Our pitching staff did, that's for sure. Even Gilmartin and deGrom at the plate. :)"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,stb91,2,Mon Jul 20 00:29:53 2015 UTC,Need to find a clip of this degrom pitch hit at bat. Flamingo

NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Unclaimed--Pants,9,Mon Jul 20 00:18:46 2015 UTC,duda looked absolutely awful again today.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,9,Mon Jul 20 00:29:49 2015 UTC,I feel like the Mets owe me something after watching every single inning of that mess
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,G-P-S-McAwesomeville,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:01 2015 UTC,Despair?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,elfmeh,7,Mon Jul 20 01:18:30 2015 UTC,No plawecki tomorrow huh?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,7,Mon Jul 20 00:17:21 2015 UTC,Plawecki is gonna need to be carried to the plane.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Rules_row,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:33 2015 UTC,I was thinking that also. But who is gonna carry him?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,39,Mon Jul 20 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"The pitching staff, again."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Minoripriest,6,Mon Jul 20 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, A+."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Rules_row,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:39 2015 UTC,I set you up well for that.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:30 2015 UTC,Definitely not.  Murphy will probably sit as well
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,kickthepony,8,Mon Jul 20 00:25:43 2015 UTC,can you imagine if we had a player like Goldshmicht with a .400+ average with RISP? He could have had like 8 RBI's today potentially.   Yes I know that's not how it works but my point still stands.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,5,Mon Jul 20 00:32:59 2015 UTC,actually hed probably only get like 2 rbis today and we wouldve been done in 9
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,dvargas92495,25,Mon Jul 20 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"i watched inning 9-13, said fuck it when the cards hit a hr, went and watched an episode of archer, napped, took a shower, shaved, got dressed etc. came back to see the mets game was still on, so i flipped it on. boom. W. you're welcome?"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,buquicchioli,30,Mon Jul 20 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"You gave up for a few innings, so I'm not saying thank you"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,rbart65,4,Mon Jul 20 00:23:32 2015 UTC,Everyone should take midgame naps... As long as said game is going to last 6 hours.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,buquicchioli,2,Mon Jul 20 00:55:51 2015 UTC,The 14th inning powernap. It's totally a thing.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,BarristanSelfie,7,Mon Jul 20 11:55:13 2015 UTC,"Soooo, what did you guys do for 5 hours and 54 minutes today?"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,zfmag,22,Mon Jul 20 00:16:21 2015 UTC,Listened to Keith keith as hard as I've ever heard him keith.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,bicyclemom,20,Mon Jul 20 00:37:50 2015 UTC,bitched and moaned and yelled and screamed and was ultimately happy at the end
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,joeydeno,3,Mon Jul 20 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Happy is a strong word. Not entirely displeased, maybe."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,buquicchioli,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:46 2015 UTC,nah happy because we did something good
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,joeydeno,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:17 2015 UTC,"good is a strong word. didn't completely fuck up, maybe"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,buquicchioli,6,Mon Jul 20 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that was awful to watch. Something has to change. But, we won anyway and that's all that matters. LGM"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,standardbluejay,5,Mon Jul 20 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't be opposed to changing some stuff, for sure, but also, this is a pretty goddamn amazing pitching staff we faced."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,three_dee,4,Mon Jul 20 00:21:51 2015 UTC,this is a pretty goddamn amazing pitching staff we faced have.   FTFY
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,5,Mon Jul 20 00:24:18 2015 UTC,or both?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Jayk_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  I'm reading a lot of frustrated posts about the offense coming up short over and over, and that's certainly valid, but we also watched 18 innings of amazing pitching on our side.  Just saying, our lineup is depleted to begin with, but then things look worse when you're facing a team like this who can throw a great arm at you every inning of a series.  This is what other teams feel when they face us."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,three_dee,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:41 2015 UTC,True. I felt so bad for Niese though.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,standardbluejay,2,Mon Jul 20 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"True.  He pitched his heart out.  But, if he's a pro, he should be satisfied with the team win."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,three_dee,6,Mon Jul 20 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize how much I could get accomplished during an 18 inning game. Nap, walk down the street to grab a snack, fill out save the dates, make dinner, eat dinner, take a quick walk, read some, and also watch about 5 full innings."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,cromulentc,5,Mon Jul 20 00:28:50 2015 UTC,"Fun times! Today was excruciatingly painful, but a win is a win. May have depleted our bullpen, but we really needed to avoid the sweep. Good news is, two out from the 2nd Wild card spot and also 2 out from the division lead while we head to DC with Harvey, deGrom and Syndergaard going. Going to be a fun series!"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,domspart,4,Mon Jul 20 00:19:09 2015 UTC,Great win but what's the deal with Duda?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,LordBlackass,4,Mon Jul 20 00:43:25 2015 UTC,He's been bad for awhile now.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Clown_Shoe,7,Mon Jul 20 01:20:25 2015 UTC,good game guys lets do this again tomorrow
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,joeydeno,7,Mon Jul 20 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"The Mets are 48-44, 8-6 in July, 16-30 on the road and 9-17 against the NL Central. The Mets are 23-8 in day games and 11-4 on Sundays. This game was 18 innings in 5 hours, 55 minutes. This is the longest game of the season. The longest games in major league history were 25 innings, Chicago versus Milwaukee on May 8, 1984 (8:06) and Giants at Mets, May 31, 1964 (7:23). Ruben Tejada has a seven game hitting streak. Mets pitchers lead the majors with 33 hits and 15 RBI. Uniform watch: In 2015, the Mets are 24-11 in the home pinstripes, 5-3 in the home blues, 2-0 in the camo uniforms, 6-14 in the road blues, 8-14 in the road grays and 0-1 in the Negro League throwbacks. Bryce Harper is 0-12 with one walk and six strikeouts against Matt Harvey.   Next game: RHP Matt Harvey (8-6, 3.07) vs. LHP Gio Gonzalez (6-4, 3.99) at 19:05 EDT"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Blue387,3,Mon Jul 20 00:23:53 2015 UTC,Tomorrow is not going to be a pretty game but at least we walked away with a win.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,MotherFuckingLuBu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:21:13 2015 UTC,I fully expect the mets to not take BP and go out and score 5 runs.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,3,Mon Jul 20 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"The game might have gone way too long but baseball is a funny game and I'll take that win. Despite the Mets leaving 25 runners on base, the Mets got it done. They avoid the sweep. The pitching held its own. I hope that the win will energize the Mets for tomorrow against the Nats after a tiring game."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,petezahut93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, it was horrible.  The pitching was great, but all that stood out was that the Mets can't get a hit with risp.  It was one of the most frustrating games I've ever watched."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,DepravedMutant,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:12 2015 UTC,We only have one more road series against the Central this year so that's nice
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,see_mohn,2,Mon Jul 20 00:27:58 2015 UTC,Yeah? Fuck the NL Central
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,3,Mon Jul 20 00:34:40 2015 UTC,sweet moses i was literally out for 5 hours and this shit was still on when i came back
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,greybro,3,Mon Jul 20 00:31:10 2015 UTC,I'm camping in the forest and have an 0.01mbps connection- has no problem keeping ahead of the game.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Agothro,2,Mon Jul 20 02:32:47 2015 UTC,how about we trade the farm for someone like cameron maybin who just rakes with RISP.  yes i'm half kidding
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:17 2015 UTC,An 18 inning win should count as two wins because fuck the Nats.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,dblydenburgh,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:20 2015 UTC,Sounds like Cuddyer is on his way to the DL.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:35:54 2015 UTC,conforto confirmdo?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:59 2015 UTC,doubt it.  If they don't trade for no one then there is no point bringing him up and putting all that pressure on him.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,3,Mon Jul 20 00:39:26 2015 UTC,what pressure? if he hits .250 he'd be a god send!  nah i know what you mean
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,halvin_and_cobbes,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:17 2015 UTC,Tejada was 3-4? With 2BB?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:33 2015 UTC,Saw Mejia's dp celebration. How i missed him.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:20 2015 UTC,Can anyone find the team RISP from the past 9 games please? I'm curious.

NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,mozzarella72,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:45 2015 UTC,Where is this?
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"during the post game interview. I mean I guess I shouldn't say crying but clearly teary eyed, holding it together"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,mozzarella72,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"Good thing I went to work today, so I didnt have to sit through 18 innings."
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,IamNeo123,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:08:40 2015 UTC,I want to see how Terry spins this game into a positive.
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,9,Mon Jul 20 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"Uh, we won against the best team in baseball?"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,domspart,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, What about the used bullpen, broken left fielder, sore catcher, 3rd baseman on a bad quad, and CF 1B combo that went 2 for 15 with 5SO?"
NewYorkMets,3dw0bm,Desertstarr,3,Mon Jul 20 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but this was a big win going into a really big series in Washington. We can beat anyone in MLB when we have the Big 3 going like we do next series. That's al the positivity I need :)"
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,joeydeno,12,Mon Jul 20 01:10:48 2015 UTC,With Plawecki likely unavailable tomorrow after catching 18 innings today this makes a lot of sense. I don't blame the Mets for not wanting to start Monell in the first game of a critical series when they have a veteran in Recker available who is also a better defender than Monell. Recker putting up a 1.038 OPS with 7 HR in his 21 games in Vegas probably didn't hurt either.
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,BillW87,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:02 2015 UTC,Recker is a veteran now? He was in AA the same year as Donaldson
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,frakking-anustart,16,Mon Jul 20 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"31 years old and has appeared in 5 MLB seasons (admittedly very few games in most of them) and was drafted back in 2005. Compared to any other catcher on our staff he's a veteran, at the very least. He was playing professional baseball while Dilson Herrera was starting middle school."
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,BillW87,-7,Mon Jul 20 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"Just because Dilson Herrera is young doesn't mean Recker is old. Herera was born in 1994- That's only a little younger than Addison Russell.  Recker being 31 years old is crazy. I guess in the context of the Mets catching corps he's a veteran but Anthony ""Ass"" Recker is not a true oldie"
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,frakking-anustart,6,Mon Jul 20 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"He definitely will be starting tomorrow then, I assume."
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,Rules_row,5,Mon Jul 20 02:05:37 2015 UTC,big booty is back in town.
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,RdogMILLIONAIRE,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this didn't happen sooner, at least Recker has some pop (despite his average)."
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,madisonfootball99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:25:29 2015 UTC,PLAN THE PARADE
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,jordansideas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:36 2015 UTC,All hail based Recker!
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,BullShifts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:58 2015 UTC,Monell deserved another shot but didn't do anything with it.  Glad to have Recker back.
NewYorkMets,3dw6e5,bjoura,0,Mon Jul 20 12:42:44 2015 UTC,I think he will start the first two games. I can't imagine after a 18 inning affair Plaw getting a one game breather then back in.
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,Glenn_Tennis,9,Mon Jul 20 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"I just want to see them hold their own in this series against the Nationals. The Gnats are starting to put it together. I'm not even asking for them to win the series, just take 1 out of 3 and be competitive in all three games, and that should signal to the fans and the front office that a move is justifiable, that this team is good enough that upgrading on offense really will put them into contention for a wild card spot. That's what we saw in 2 of these 3 games against the Cards, and that's I'm looking for in this series."
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,dumbego,5,Mon Jul 20 02:36:31 2015 UTC,We took 2 out of 3 from LA earlier this month. Just prepare for our Big 3 against WSH.
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,TriviaWhiz,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. That's the one that gives me the most anxiety. Almost a sink or swim series. Do or die. They need to just effing HIT. Cmon duda, get it together again. I know it's in him.. Can't understand these hot/cold streaks with him."
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,VenConmigo,5,Mon Jul 20 02:08:18 2015 UTC,Ya gotta believe....
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,three_dee,4,Mon Jul 20 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"We hung with LA in their park on a tough road trip, and pulled out 2 of 3.  It won't be easy, for sure, but there's no reason to think we will get trampled on in our own park."
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,philiagape,3,Mon Jul 20 05:32:27 2015 UTC,"I've struggled with this team all season. But you know what? I've got this sneaky feeling that these Mets, even as currently constituted, are a playoff caliber team.  Is it always pretty? No. But does the club roll over just because we're facing someone other than Miami or Philadelphia? Absolutely not. Now let's sweep Washington this week and take over first place."
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,mikerhoa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:34 2015 UTC,We all knew this stretch would decide the season. I'm just glad that I'm going to see the Dodgers game on Fri and I'm getting the DeGrom shirt!  Love the T + E reference btw...
NewYorkMets,3dw8cd,sheeplikepeep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as frightening. Yes, their ability to move runners and score is seriously misguided. But, there was some interesting stuff there when Terry went with the small ball plays in the 18th, maybe we end up moving more towards that style of play, I'm cool with that.  The real reason that you shouldn't fear these next series is our starting pitching. The Nats are a great team, but no one really considers their offense to be ""scary"". And LA is LA, no one knows what's going to happen out there."

Take a shot every time Gary tries to inject life into the broadcast booth. Finish your drink every time Keith ""tsks"" or groans with disappointment at the Mets' futile attempts at ""offense"".   Of course, your mileage may vary; you may succumb to alcohol poisoning, or do permanent, irreparable damage to your liver. Either way you'll be closer to the sweet release of death than the Mets will be to putting a run across with runners in scoring position."

NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,BillW87,11,Sun Jul 19 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"I have no evidence to support this claim, it's just pure speculation on my part, but I think Conforto is in Binghamton because there is an instructional component of his day to day schedule that is easier to conduct in the Catskills versus the desert, and much more preferable to conduct in the minors than in the majors.   Conforto does not have to worry about the competition he's facing at AA, he's raking it in. That means he can focus all his efforts on the instructional component of his development and not have to deal with blistering heat."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,thestral_rider,5,Sun Jul 19 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"I just always fins it funny how they need more time to groom in the minors when he's only months younger than Trout, Harper,Bryant...., I know he's not those guys but damn.....Let's not forget the Cubs also promoted Kyle Schwarber this week and he was picked a whole 6 spots in front of Conforto in the draft..."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,InvisibleTeeth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:48:39 2015 UTC,Schwarber was called because on an injury. If the Mets had no other choice calling up Conforto would be fine

NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:40 2015 UTC,Yes.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Rules_row,9,Mon Jul 20 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"People will tell you that we shouldn't rush Conforto or that he isn't ready but they're completely ignoring the fact that professional scouts said he was the most polished and MLB ready bat in his draft year and would only need a couple seasons of minor league ball at most. His ceiling isn't Miguel Cabrera or Mike Trout but he has an extremely high floor and should at least bring something to the table.  A bit off topic here, but it's really annoying that him getting playing time may be an issue next season because we'll still have Cuddyer. I didn't understand why we needed someone on a two year deal when all we needed was a one year stopgap."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Undercover_Mop,7,Sun Jul 19 07:24:07 2015 UTC,They just don't want to start the clock on his MLB service time.  Everything this club does comes down to having an empty wallet.  Wilpon needs to go away and bring someone in who can afford a major market team salary pool.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,berkchops516,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:20:54 2015 UTC,I agree that everything they do is calculated so that they don't have to spend but bringing Conforto up wouldn't start his service time clock since he won't gain enough days in the majors to count as a year of service. The only thing I can think of is that they don't want to give him an MLB paycheck.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Undercover_Mop,2,Mon Jul 20 02:01:13 2015 UTC,Yup. Awful Cuddy signing was and is awful.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:27 2015 UTC,"Conforto isn't 19.  The guy is 22 and has plenty of college experience.  He's already faced some adversity with a slump in A ball.  He was being thrown in all day and struggled, but made adjustments and played well again.  That's the type of thing you need to show you're ready for the bigs.  He's done nothing but hit since he got to AA.  There is no reason for him to be wasted in the minors any more.  How cheap the Mets are it's probably a play to keep his arbitration eligibility to a minimum.    Herrera on the other end probably needs a little more seasoning.  Not that he's not physically ready, but he's struggled a bit with playing time.  I think for him it's a little maturation being needed, and remember his first exposure to the bigs was at 20, 2 years younger than Conforto is now."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,jerseyjokes,3,Sun Jul 19 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not on the whole 'zOMG call up Conforto noooowwww' train, but I can't understand why the Mets resigned and then promoted Nieuwy while shipping Alex Castellanos to Japan.  Certainly you'd want to give another AAA prospect a shot instead of bringing back someone who had already been DFAed earlier this season.  Is Kirk really that much better, and wasn't he fairly middling in this season's Vegas stint?"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,MaddingtonBear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:38 2015 UTC,Nieuwy's a lefty. Castellanos is a righty. That's the answer.

NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,MaddingtonBear,2,Sun Jul 19 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"Also the captain can play every outfield position, and fairly well at that. Defense goes a long way."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,GodEmperorBrian,0,Sun Jul 19 22:03:04 2015 UTC,Right. He's the one guy who can start for us in CF if/when Lagares goes down.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,3,Mon Jul 20 10:15:54 2015 UTC,"Kirk and Muno are bench players, that's their role on the team. If you want to replace them with Dilson and Conforto, that would be a way bigger waste of the latter two's talent than letting them play in the minors every day."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,JimSta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:17 2015 UTC,If Dilson and Conforto are brought up they would play every day
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,bmd4567,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:38:43 2015 UTC,Conforto won't get time over Cuddyer. Cuddyer will get every chance to play.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Clown_Shoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:05:21 2015 UTC,"Not if they bring up Conforto. If they bring up Conforto, then it means Sandy has given up on Cuddy"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,bmd4567,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:49 2015 UTC,Which is exactly why I doubt they bring him up unless Cuddyer goes to the DL.  Conforto needs to play everyday and with Cuddyer here he won't.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Clown_Shoe,6,Mon Jul 20 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Initial opinion- ""wasting AB's"" is a flat out lie. As is ""doesnt challenge them"". You know this for a fact? Oh right, irs just speculation.  Look its a fun new trend to rush prospects but still. Its good to embarrass pitching as a hitter, but rushing someone could lead to David Cyde 2.0.   Hate to tell ya but prospects bust. If not Conforto, Nimmo.   A ""cup of coffee"" in the minors doesn't scar people. Jumping a league when you aren't ready but you think you are does.  Tl; dr - we aren't professionals and should leave it up to the GM  Sorry If this is confusing, its late and I'm trying to respond to the complete post"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,9,Sun Jul 19 04:40:59 2015 UTC,"If you're making the pitchers you're facing look like batting practice, yeah you're wasting at bats from a developmental standpoint. He needs to be facing pitchers that challenge him to improve as a hitter. You don't become a powerlifter by repping 10 pound dumbells all day, and you don't become a major league hitter by mashing dingers against AA pitchers for months."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,3,Sun Jul 19 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"Batting practice? Well thats a fun exaggeration. Is he batting like .750 (BA)?  Look there are people who have been watching baseball before our grandparents balls dropped so Itrust them when to promote players.  There has never once been a prospect who has been ""stalled"" w/out injury.  You might think he's ""hitting so many dingerz omg"" but baseball is a fickle game and a cruel mistress. With slumps."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,6,Sun Jul 19 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"Moving players up is a risk, but so is the alternative that the Mets are faced with which is giving up a major piece of their future to add a bat to their lineup. Which do you think is a bigger risk: The chance that Michael Conforto turns out to be such a delicate little flower that a rough month in the majors ruins his poor fragile little mind so badly that not even the hitter-friendly PCL can set him straight...or the Mets regret trading off a future Cy Young-potential arm like Syndergaard or Matz? Also, I'm not sure where you get this idea that front offices deserve some sort of near-worship levels of reverence. Sure, they do this for a living. That doesn't mean that all of them are good at it or are right in 100% of their decisions. RAJ has been in baseball all his life but he sure as hell hasn't managed to build a good franchise for the Phillies."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,gometrule,-2,Sun Jul 19 05:10:34 2015 UTC,"RAJ is the outlier. Like Mike Trout.  Most of my counter-argument was covered in my other reply (replying to the same comment twice always bugs me, but then again I'm dead so its understandable)  You are confusing. Are you getting on a soapbox and bitching about people wanting to trade Syndergaard and Matz? Because I love these guys but I hate to break it to ya but people bust. I mean Cahill+Anderson+Mazzaro looked like a lock only a short time ago. I mean Syndergaard has a lower floor higher ceiling than all three of those previously named pitchers,  but still only Mike Trout and Correa are sure bets.   OR are you getting on a soapbox and bitching about calling up Conforto? Because if you David Clyne/Ranger whip him you'll be wishing he was a fucking delicate flower. Now I know Clyne was a different situation (basically more extreme) but his implosion tought MLB a valuable lesson. Looks like you want to repeat history. That's cute"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,5,Sun Jul 19 05:41:06 2015 UTC,"This isn't just his opinion. Keith Law has said that the Mets are far too conservative with their prospects. Normally that wouldn't be all that big of a deal, but your half of your argument relies on argument from authority. Well now two authorities say opposing things.   Sandy isn't infallible. Sometimes he does things that don't make sense. You can't just rely on justifying things by saying that Sandy knows more than us, so he must be right. Make an argument about statistics that justifies Conforto staying in AA.  The other half of your argument relies on one guy 40 years ago being rushed to the majors at age 18. Conforto is 22 and has nearly 600 PAs in the minors plus 4 years of college baseball under his belt. Comparing Conforto to a guy who was brought straight to the majors at age 18 is just pointless. They're very different cases."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,gometrule,0,Sun Jul 19 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"I mentioned they were different cases-i say it up there. Now I did also mention not to rush Conforto, and with all that you said its an interesting case to promote him to AAA.   The way I saw it at 12:47 am, was that OP was being ignorent about the minor league system and selfish about Confront being an impact in August. That's just preposterous"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, but they're so different they're not even worth mentioning together.   I don't think it's selfish. I think it's unrealistic to say that he's going to save the offense, which some people seem to think will happen. But OP doesn't say that and he knows more about the minor league system than anyone on here. It's just worth trying and if nothing else, he gets a taste of the majors and goes back down to AAA afterwards.   That's exactly what the Cubs did with Schwarber. They gave him a shot, he showed that he wouldn't be lost in the majors and now he's getting an extended look there. Schwarber is the same age and was drafted in the same year with roughly the same number of PAs in the minor leagues. It won't destroy Conforto to give him a chance to prove he's ready."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,gometrule,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"In hindsight?  Yeah it wasn't but I really couldn't rhink of another case of promoting a bat from AA. Buxton, but that was because of an injury.   What I mean by selfish is that OP thinks that Conforto can do good for the team (maybe) but I think It would hurt his overall career in the end. Unless he's coming up for an injury to someone in the OF.  I get OP by saying ""dont trade a pitcher, there are in house options"" but I certainly think OP was overhyping Conforto.  Schwarber came up for an injury, right? And had AAA PA's and was then send back down for more AAA PA's.  I always thought that the Mets should have called Syndergaard last September,  so maybe they do stall guys. Idk."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"Schwarber was injury yeah. But no AAA PAs before MLB. He came straight from AA and then was sent back down to AAA.   I don't agree that Conforto is a reason not to trade for someone else. But I do agree that it wouldn't be a bad thing for him to get a shot to prove he's ready. I don't think there's much left to show at AA, and our AAA franchise is so stacked in favor of offense that it almost seems trivial."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,0,Sun Jul 19 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"Out of the guys you mention, none had the pure stuff of any of the Mets' top 5. If those guys don't become productive Major Leaguers, it will be due to injury, not development. Syndergaard already has a higher floor than all three of those guys' ceilings."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,bmd4567,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:01:20 2015 UTC,Lose the shitty attitude. It takes away from your otherwise insightful comments.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,-5,Sun Jul 19 13:59:05 2015 UTC,Your reasoning is pretty fucking dumb
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,frakking-anustart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:04 2015 UTC,"Conforto's ETA is 2016/2017, right?  I can see an argument for Conforto being called up for yall in September because of his torrid AA season (only because teams are rushing prospects more and more) but that is the max. Conforto < some OF you can trade, who is *already * a major leaguer"
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,bmd4567,4,Sun Jul 19 05:04:02 2015 UTC,"Trading isn't a magic ""push button to improve team"" option. You have to give something up in order to get a major league player back. If we have options inside our own system that cost us nothing to improve our team we shouldn't be willing to give up major pieces of our team's future to achieve the same end. It may be true that Conforto < a proven OF, but Conforto + Thor/Matz > a proven outfielder. All Conforto has to do is be better than a -0.2 fWAR Cuddyer or 0.0 fWAR Nieuwenhuis in order to improve our team. I'm not saying he's going to save our offense or anything, but I do think that we should explore all reasonable options available to improve our team, either by large or small amounts. If we set aside all the WFAN-worthy trade suggestions on this sub, the fact is that acquiring proven major league talent in trade (especially mid-season) is really expensive if you're trying to buy them in prospects/unproven players. We have Noah Syndergaard, Travis d'Arnaud, Zack Wheeler, Dilson Herrera, and Vic Black in our organization as proof of that fact."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:18:16 2015 UTC,"trading isn't a magical push button fix  that's my trigger   Couldn't agree more about the first part. You don't need to fucking tell me about trades lol. But look at the great players now in baseball- most of them were all in the minors raking while the big league club had some journeyman 4 A player. Does it suck? Maybe, but unless that OF gets injured Conforto isn't rushed.  Large or small amounts? I'm sure Conforto has some holes in his swing. Good god he's in AA once they figure him out they will demolish him unless he has time to adjust.  When prospects are called up, they usually have greta beginings. But then the pitching catches up to them and their confidence, stars and more is destroyed.   If that happens, you'll want Neiuenhueis more than Conforto  tl;dr- Calling up Conforto when the Rosters expand in September makes sense. Get his feet wet, let him come off the bench, etc. Hell, he might even bring something to the table. But if you put him in now by September MLB pitching might catch up to him. AA PITCHING IS NOT MLB PITCHING."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,5,Sun Jul 19 05:35:24 2015 UTC,So you already know everything about him and he's guaranteed to fail in the majors?
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,kooredaan,-2,Sun Jul 19 12:31:19 2015 UTC,Ignore him. He's not even a Mets fan. He comes into our sub to troll.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,IHateVideoBam,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"Grow up, bro. Also, the worst argument you can have is that letting a player get more reps will make him worse as a player. Of course there's an adjustment period but a minor leaguer can only adjust to Major League pitching by facing Major League pitching."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,bongggblue,0,Sun Jul 19 14:02:24 2015 UTC,"Really, Conforto is the Mets offensive saviour? He is not Kris Bryant."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,6,Sun Jul 19 05:32:09 2015 UTC,He's Mike Trout.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,ambiguously_level,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:39:53 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to be the savior. One player doesn't make an offense, not even Kris Bryant. Giancarlo Stanton is proof that no matter how good he is, one hitter doesn't make a team. But I do think the Mets should look at any options available to them to improve their team, and considering that the guys he'd be taking playing time away from have been terrible this year (Cuddyer: -0.2 fWAR, Nieuwenhuis: 0.0 fWAR) the bar is set pretty damn low for what Conforto would have to do in order to make our team even a little bit better. Even if the Mets do go out and get another bat before the trade deadline that doesn't mean they shouldn't still explore every option available to them to improve their roster including promoting players from within their own system who play well enough to earn a chance."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,0,Sun Jul 19 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"I dunno though. I think we got the Stockholm Syndrome so much with this team because they have been running out a mostly AAAA lineup now for the better part of 2 or 3 years. I'd like to see Conforto up in September maybe, but if he's still projected to be 2 or 3 years away, then bringing him up early may ruin his potential value if a good trade proposal comes along this offseason.   I'm just thinking back to Lastings Milledge and what we could have gotten for him before he even played a major league game. I mean before he came up Boston was looking to trade Manny Ramirez for him. Aftee he played a bit in the majors he netted us Brian Schneider and Ryan Church. Decent haul but neither of those dudes had the clout that Manny did at that time..."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,mdrelich90,2,Sun Jul 19 07:41:39 2015 UTC,"He's been projected to hit the Majors this year. His peak will probably be around 2020-21, but he should be a Major Leaguer this year if he stays healthy."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking christ...this kid isn't the next Barry Bonds, he's not going to save our season. In fact, there's a very good chance he'll hit like Cuddyer after calling him up. I have an idea: let's not put a highly touted prospect on an anemic offense and tell him, ""Hey, we suck. You need to make us not suck or else you're gonna head back down."""
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,mdrelich90,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:14:34 2015 UTC,"Not how it works at all. Cuddyer has been terrible against right-handed pitching. Conforto could already be better. It's also not like he's a head case; he has been working towards a callup his entire life. Letting a player reach his dreams because he has pedigree, makeup, and the numbers is absolutely worth doing because it both helps player development and the current team."
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:52 2015 UTC,I just don't see the value in trading for bats or rushing our prospects up to the bigs. This team is not good enough to win the WS even with an added bat or two. The only difference between 80 and 85 wins is the draft pick. I understand people are frustrated with the lack of progress and consistent winning over the years but rushing prospects is a gamble that could unravel the entire plan and set us back again and trading for bats potentially loses us future starting players for a short term gain of half a season maybe two seasons of above average replacements.  That's just me. I'm okay with the patience as long as we continue to have promising prospects in the pipeline.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,mdrelich90,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:39:10 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference in terms of revenue between 80 and 85. An 80-win team will not be drawing crowds late in the season. An 85-win team would be competing for the Wild Card into the last week of the season. People would actually watch. The difference is huge for this team's financial flexibility in the offseason. Nobody says we want to rush prospects; we want to see prospects that are already better than the guys we're putting out there day after day.
NewYorkMets,3dt1u4,Metsican,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:51:20 2015 UTC,They might be better but I respect the organization's opinion on making sure they are ready to reach their full potential. It's not hard to be better when half the team is batting .220 but if an extra year in development could mean a player would be batting .280 instead of .260 like if he was rushed then I wait the extra year everytime.  I agree with most people here though that September call ups seem like a great time to get these guys some MLB experience to take with them into their development next season.

Sabermetrically, your #1, #2, and #4 spots should go to your 3 best hitters, so let's go only by Batting Average. Grandy ranks 4th in BA, so sabermetrically Juan is your leadoff guy. #2 spot goes to one of your 3 best again, so that is either Murph or Flores. I like Flores here. He has power sure, but he mostly provides base hits that move runners (or he strikes out). 3rd spot goes to your 5th best hitter, which is unfortunately Cuddyer. So in this hypothetical setting, Juan gets on, Flores Ks and Cuddyer hits into a 6-4-3 double play, because that's what he does now, your inning is over. #4 spot goes to your top 3 hitter with the highest slugging percentage, which is Murphy, and that's ok. 5th in the lineup is your 4th best hitter and according to Batting Averages, that is now Granderson. 6th and 7th are your 6th and 7th best hitters, so Tejada and Duda take those slots. 8th you bat the the Pitcher and 9th in the worst hitter on the team, in this case it's Plaw. That's why these lineups keep changing, because if Sandy believes in Sabermetrics, the team looks awful and it's almost impossible to play. To reiterate we're looking at this:  -Lagares -Flores -Cuddyer -Murphy -Granderson -Tejada -Duda -Pitcher -Plawecki  Sabermetircally and according to the numbers that's the ""ideal"" lineup...."
NewYorkMets,3dspwi,PicassoYourNose,4,Sun Jul 19 03:13:39 2015 UTC,"If you're going for the 'sabermetric' lineup, determining who your best hitters are by batting average is pretty bad. Going by wRC+, our best 3 hitters are Granderson, Duda, and Murph. So you can go with Grandy 1st, Murph 2nd, Duda 4th."
NewYorkMets,3dspwi,roby6907,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely. And you're right about going by batting average. But with the way Grandy has been hitting lately, I don't know if you can still keep batting him leadoff. Grandy has hit 14 home runs, with 30 RBIs. Of those 14 home runs, 11 have been solo shots and the other 3 were 2 run homers. That makes 17 of his 30 RBIs from Home Runs. In 6 of those games he hit solo shots, the mets lost by 1 or 2 runs. If you had one other person on base in half for half of his solo dingers, he has 40 RBIs and the Mets either win those games and they lead the division. MAYBE. I just don't see Grandy as a leadoff hitter anymore. Not when he's leading the team in homers and Slugging %."
NewYorkMets,3dspwi,PicassoYourNose,2,Sun Jul 19 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"Determining a lineup is one of the few times that BA can be useful. For example, a few years back SEA was supposed to compete after acquiring Lee and Bedard to accompany an already well established King Felix. They also brought Figgens over from LAA. Both Figgens and Ichiro were coming off +.400 OBP years and the belief was that having them bat 1 & 2 would lead to the otherwise meager offense scoring enough runs for what was supposed to be a dominant pitching staff.   When you looked at how Figgens' and Ichiro's OBPs were composed, Figgens was walking significantly more often and had a lower batting average than Ichiro. While SEA led Ichiro off that season, they should have had him batting second. While they were both anticipated to get on base at the same rate, Ichiro was anticipated to get more hits. If Ichiro leads off with a single, and then Figgens draws a walk, they would have runners on first and second. However, if Figgens leads off with a walk, and then Ichiro gets a single, then they likely have runners on the corners, or potentially a run of Figgens were to steal second.  SEA was a huge disappointment that year, and I'm not going to suggest it was from leading Ichiro off. I just want to suggest that there is a time to use BA when figuring a batting order, though it is a very rare event. I also want to agree with you that the lineup you first responded to (I'm on baconreader so I can't see the user's name) is not really sabermetrically based, it's just another example of someone claiming that there idea is backed by sabermetrics even when it's not. Anyone who really studies sabermetrics knows that new theories are constantly being made being competing schools of sabermetritians, and that it's really never safe to claim that something is ""sabermetrically the best"" if you're some average ball scratching redditor. Bill James can come out and make such a statement, though he probably never would."

At the same time, it is sickening to see the little run support given to the pitchers. It's like as if it is DIY at times with the Mets pitchers to get run support. Hopefully better fortunes will come for the Mets tomorrow and Sunday and the Mets continue their winning ways."

Why stick with two guys who clearly cannot play major league baseball? Anyone would be better. Try someone new. Anyone new. They have no value so who cares if they get claimed? I'm not saying bring up Conforto because he is one of our elite prospects and needs the time, but try Castellanos or any number of other guys in the minors who haven't gotten a shot yet. It's absurd that not one player in our organization can be brought up to replace Kirk and Campbell.  Quick edit, what is our record when scoring 4 runs? We average 3.4 runs per game (third worst in mlb btw). League average is almost exactly 4. If we were average we would be an amazing team."

Ok, if baseball is a game of sample sizes, why are you isolating his 77 PA from this year instead of looking at his career numbers? He's been worth 2.3 fWAR in 629 career PA. An average major league player has a WAR of 2.0 per 650 PA. So, in the largest sample size we have, Kirk is actually a league average player and therefore really good for a bench piece.   He's also never been below replacement level, even this year."

NewYorkMets,3dmj0w,Desertstarr,6,Fri Jul 17 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting Flamingo Facts: Adult bird is 3.3 - 4.6 feet tall and weigh between 3.3 - 9 pounds. Flamingos wingspan ranges from 3.3 - 5 feet. Color of their feather is result of their diet: pigments in their food (called carotenoids) are responsible for red and pink colors of their feathers. They eat shrimps, algae, crustaceans… When they eat, their head is positioned upside-down. They suck water and filter the food. Flamingos hold their breath while feeding. During migration, they fly up to 37 miles per hour and travel distance of over 300 miles to reach their new habitat. Flamingos spend 15-30% of the day in cleaning their feathers: oil produced in a special gland will be spread over feathers with a help of their beak. Flamingos live in large groups called colonies. Some colonies consist of million birds. Baby flamingos will hatch in the nest made of mud. Flamingos are monogamous (they have just one partner) and they produce one egg each year. Both mother and father keep the egg warm before it hatches. Few days after hatching both parents will start feeding their chick with milk-like substance rich in fats and proteins. Baby flamingos don't have curved bill, it becomes curved after few months. When they want to rest, flamingos stand on one leg. The visible ""knee"" of the flamingo is actually ankle joint. True knee is close to the body and can't be seen because of the feathers. Flamingos live between 20 and 30 years."

NewYorkMets,3drsmb,splenda806,3,Sat Jul 18 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Trading Thor straight up for Tulo would be too much on our end. I know the Rockies would want that, but the time when that trade was at all acceptable from our end is in the past."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,roby6907,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that far off, but probably isn't enough to get the deal done. Plaw is a top catching prospect, something Colorado is looking for. Cecchini isn't ready, but shows a lot of promise for the future. Fulmer has been great in the minors this season and looks like the next big pitching prospect for us. Niese gives them a reliable arm for now and his value has never been higher than it is right now. The Rockies would be getting three of our top prospects and shedding Tulo's contract."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,Metsican,7,Sat Jul 18 21:09:52 2015 UTC,They don't want Niese if they're moving Tulo. They want at least one of Harvey/Matz/Thor/deGrom/Wheeler in addition to Fulmer/Rosario/Plawecki to get the conversation started.
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,bmd4567,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but I think this trade is something they would have to at least consider. Their price may have dropped on Tulo because no one was biting and he is already 30, so they may want to get some good prospects out of him now. Again, this is all just speculation on my part, I have absolutely no idea what either front office is thinking or if this has been discussed already."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,SteveBIRK,11,Sat Jul 18 22:11:07 2015 UTC,Why not trade for Upton? He's cheaper
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,bmd4567,5,Sat Jul 18 21:11:57 2015 UTC,Because he's an FA at the end of the year. I'd rather not have a reverse Beltran-Wheeler situation. Especially since there is apparently no money to be spent.
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,SteveBIRK,3,Sat Jul 18 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"If they were to get Upton, it would be pretty much guaranteed that he signs with the Mets"
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,bmd4567,3,Sat Jul 18 22:03:25 2015 UTC,If it's a sign and trade I'm all for it but I don't know if that is the FO's intentions
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,bmd4567,3,Sat Jul 18 22:05:43 2015 UTC,For Upton it most definitely would be. He's in his prime now. If it was Zobrist they would let him walk
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,Metsican,0,Sat Jul 18 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"For me, Upton has more red flags than Tulo (I know, hip surgeries are a big red flag). First, I think it's telling that teams keep trying to get rid of Upton and might say something about his character or attitude. Second, Upton is an incredibly streaky hitter, and when he's cold he'll be just as unproductive as the rest of this lineup. Third, he's a free agent at the end of the season. If we were able to agree on an extension before the trade, I'd feel better about it, but I think Tulo is the guy to get. Just my opinion though."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,Senor_Met,4,Sat Jul 18 21:18:54 2015 UTC,Character problems are overblown
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,Senor_Met,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"They can be, but they still are concerning. What concerns me is how Arizona was so willing to ship him off when he was 24 and an MVP candidate."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,bmd4567,8,Sat Jul 18 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"Arizona is also run by clowns, so that's not saying much."

NewYorkMets,3drsmb,banana455,2,Sat Jul 18 21:30:37 2015 UTC,I don't want any part of Tulo. The price he commands is far too high for his injury history and age imo. Focus on getting Upton or Gomez right now.
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,domspart,5,Sun Jul 19 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"so we're pissed of that Wright is hurt and past his prime and some say the team should buy him out, but we want to trade for a player who's had 2 hip surgeries and is in contract for another half a decade?"
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,ambiguously_level,10,Sat Jul 18 21:02:10 2015 UTC,Wright may never play again. Tulo is hitting around .315 while playing 80 games this season. I get your point but one of those guys has played nearly every game this season and the other...has not.
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,giobbistar21,2,Sat Jul 18 22:00:10 2015 UTC,tulo played in 91 last season and 47 in 2012. Wright has never played less than 100 games in the last 10 years and his last two injuries were bad slides.
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,Salute_The_Bud,3,Sat Jul 18 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about this year. This year, Tulo has basically not missed a game. David Wright might not ever play baseball again. At no point in his career has Tulo ever had an injury which threatened to not only permanently derail his career but also dramatically affect his quality of life the rest of life, even beyond his playing days."
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,porkopine,2,Sat Jul 18 22:49:53 2015 UTC,even if wright never plays again i think it's too risky trading good young players for a guy with two hip surgeries and a contract going past the statistical peak. what if he turns into another jason bay or johan santana where we have to pay him and wright $30 million or so per year for years to come
NewYorkMets,3drsmb,ItsAZipper,0,Sat Jul 18 22:53:40 2015 UTC,I agree there. That's a better argument to make.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,xraytech631,13,Fri Jul 17 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"He says that the arms are off the table, that's fine (and a weirdly constructed sentence).  But what about Nimmo? Conforto? Dom Smith? Cecchini?  Upton is a free agent after the season, Gomez the year after, will we have the money to re-sign them?  There are a lot of questions I have that I don't expect to get answers to right now. But if we were to shop a package with Michael Fulmer and obviously some more prospects...it'd be interesting. I trust Sandy when it comes to trading. Sort of."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,JKaye57,7,Fri Jul 17 17:06:27 2015 UTC,I trust Sandy.   I also prefer Gomez and wouldn't even bat an eye at trading Conforto for him.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Rules_row,-8,Fri Jul 17 18:40:19 2015 UTC,whoa... i hope you're never the GM of the mets...
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,kman445,6,Fri Jul 17 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"Really? If we can sign Gomez after his deal (and his value is kinda low now, he's been so-so this year) you get a proven player. We have no clue if Conforto is gonna survive the majors. He looks poised to, but you never know. People tear up the minors all the time and peter out in the majors. I would love to have Conforto, but I would go with the proven guy, and Gomez is proven."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Rules_row,9,Fri Jul 17 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't seem to understand the uncertainty inherent in the word ""prospect"". We're a bit spoiled because so much has gone right for us in that direction lately, but trading prospects makes sense when you have someone smart doing it.   Conforto in particular has been said to have a higher floor than most prospects, so I can understand being reluctant to part with him. But a lot of people are expecting to acquire a good player for weak prospects or arguing that we should certainly not give up any of our blue chip prospects. Sandy knows a good deal. He can figure it out.   Also, this made a lot of sense to me in Keith Law's chat yesterday. Not so much as pertaining to the Padres, just in general:   Bret (Toronto): AJ Preller is getting slammed for the way the Padres moves have gone, and obviously there's merit to some of that. But in the overall, is it a crazy idea for a new GM to push a lot of his minor league talent for big league talent? Viewpoints on minor league talent are almost certainly more varied, so a GM may come into a situation where some of his prospects are rated higher by other organization's then he does. By exchanging for big league talent, you can at least take a chance at getting somewhere, but if not, and assuming you haven't traded for short-term guys like Upton, you can turn that talent around for prospects you like more.  Klaw  (1:19 PM): I agree with this quite strongly. And the mandate from ownership was to make the team competitive. I read Rany's piece yesterday on Grantland, as you all should, but I think it was unfair to Preller in a few ways."

NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Rules_row,4,Fri Jul 17 21:42:03 2015 UTC,Those guys are still relatively young and would be able to contribute for years to come. I don't think Sandy would do it if there was a chance they wouldn't be able to re-sign them. Hopefully...
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,PM_ME_UR_BRACEFACE,21,Fri Jul 17 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"You ""sort of"" trust Sandy when it comes to trades? What else does he have to do, trade Cuddyer for Trout?"
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,sickgrof,20,Fri Jul 17 17:55:36 2015 UTC,That would be nice. I wouldn't mind that trade.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,EvilAnticsLive,2,Fri Jul 17 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"I like how those two words are all you got out of my comment.   I love everything Sandy has done trade wise but he talks about being willing to overpay for Zobrist, which concerns me since I don't know what his definition of ""overpay"" means. Every GM can make a bad trade. I don't count the Pagan trade since that was a shit situation to begin with. I'm just always concerned and a bit worried.   Being a fan of the Mets, Rangers, and Rams can do that to a person."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,JKaye57,0,Fri Jul 17 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Letting Turner go too, FWIW. Imagine having him be able to fill in for Wright this season..."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,PM_ME_UR_BRACEFACE,2,Fri Jul 17 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"The Dodgers didn't even know they were getting what he turned out to be. He was a utility infielder with not a ton of pop and nothing particularly flashy. I absolutely wish we had kept him but that's hindsight talking. No team in baseball, hell probably not even Turner himself thought he was going to wind up with the year he's having. Dodgers got lucky and picked up a diamond in the rough."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,CFSparta92,0,Fri Jul 17 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"We knew he could hit, we knew he was clutch, and we knew he played behind our injury prone star. Anyone the Mets can find who has a decent bat needs to stick around."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,PM_ME_UR_BRACEFACE,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:23:30 2015 UTC,"Sandy has done a good job getting prospects and retooling the system (i.e. Wheeler, TdA, Syndergaard, Herrera, Black), I completely give him that. But he's hardly made trades for MLB talent, and when he has he's failed miserably (i.e. Pagan, and you can aslo count McHugh too). Also the K-Rod trade was a complete failure. I think it's unfair to particularly crown Sandy somewhat of a ""genius"" when he's actually really struggled to get players either in FA or trades to improve the team.  It'd be really nice to see him flip some prospects for some quality MLB talent like a Upton or Gomez, like suggested, or spend some cash on some good bats."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,kr_24,5,Fri Jul 17 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"Pagan wanted out, so we didn't really hold much power, that's why he was traded for the same position he played, K-Rod had to go, so again, no bargaining power, and you can only count McHugh if you're an idiot."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,sickgrof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"that's why he was traded for the same position he played   Not really. Ramon Ramirez was really the ""centerpiece of the deal"" and was supposed to be a significant part of the bullpen. Torres was more of a ""throw-in"", like Buck was in the Marlon Byrd trade with the Pirates.  Then outside of retooling the system, what trade(s) has he made to improve the big league team? Trying to say, ""well he didn't have any leverage"" is just a cop-out for not putting any blame onto Sandy because it's complete hearsay."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,kr_24,6,Fri Jul 17 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"Have you read anything involving Pagan from around the time of that trade? No one in the organization liked his attitude. If teams know you want to sell, it absolutely decreases value. I also don't understand how you can separate the retooling of the system from improving the major league team, because it's doing exactly that."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,sickgrof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Every move he has made has been done with the intention to improve the big league club. You're taking a stance that, instead of building methodically by ""buying low"" on future Major Leaguers (Wheeler, Thor, Herrera, TdA), he should have gutted the system through panic moves. We know that doesn't work - look at the Marlins and Padres as two examples."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"he should have gutted the system through panic moves   Then what do you call this rumor that they're looking at trading for Upton or Gomez? Or that they're willing to ""overpay"" for Zobrist?   look at the Marlins and Padres as two examples   The Marlins are a terribly run organization. The Padres at least have the potential to absolutely rebuild their system if they decide to sell at the deadline. I'm not saying they're going to get all same caliber back that they traded, but they can still get some quality players. They can trade Upton, Shields, and Kimbrel."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,kr_24,0,Sun Jul 19 07:15:51 2015 UTC,Improving a team at the cusp of contention is very different than the panic moves you suggest Sandy should have made.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:40 2015 UTC,"cusp of contention   What? The Mets have basically been in the same position all season long, especially within the division. Before when people were saying ""Sandy make some serious trades to improve the team"" when they were really struggling and not hitting. Then most people here kept saying how that'd be a panic trade and how once everyone comes back from injuries the team will be fine.   Now how is this situation right now any different? The offense is still struggling, the team is basically in the same position in the standings, and with injuries."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,kr_24,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:54:24 2015 UTC,"Now how is this situation right now any different?   The rest of baseball is not the Mets' farm system, and with fewer sellers and more buyers, pretty much zero offensive talents were moved between when this team started struggling and right now because basically nobody was available and everyone else wanted those who were. That's still mostly true but now we're only 10 days from the trade deadline. Name two teams that traded for the type of offense we're looking for this season during the stretch where we added the ""s"" to ""hitting""."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:14:00 2015 UTC,"absolutely no one predicted McHugh was going to be good, and he would have no spot in the rotation anyways"
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,TomasRoncero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"Not only that, /u/kr_24 completely ignores the fact that McHugh was acquired off waivers. He was traded to the Rockies, not the Astros. 29 teams made that mistake. On the flipside, the Astros also let JD Martínez go. Blaming Sandy for the McHugh trade is absurd."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,0,Sat Jul 18 19:50:53 2015 UTC,The K-Rod trade was a complete success. The Mets got rid of him and his vesting option. It's completely wrong to discredit Sandy for not making panic moves to acquire established talent when the team wasn't close to competing.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,9,Fri Jul 17 23:10:24 2015 UTC,I'd love to get Gomez because the Nationals are going to be losing a couple guys to free agency next year and having Gomez through the season would be a huge boost to our division chances
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Senor_Met,16,Fri Jul 17 17:29:00 2015 UTC,Also I think it'd open up the possibility of shutting down Lagares. With four years on his contract ahead of him we should shut him down until he's 100% again. If he needs surgery he needs surgery.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,mattjaydunn,5,Fri Jul 17 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"I may cry if that scenario happens, but it seems to be the right move"
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,etweetz,4,Fri Jul 17 18:26:27 2015 UTC,The only silver lining is Tommy John for position players is much easier to recover from than for pitchers. Lagares could have the surgery in August and conceivably be back by Opening Day 2016. It's an 8-10 month recovery as opposed to anywhere from 12-18 for pitchers.
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,CFSparta92,3,Fri Jul 17 22:15:35 2015 UTC,I think we would have to include Lagares in any trade package for Gomez.

NewYorkMets,3dn57o,GodEmperorBrian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"Gomez moves to right with the mets. The way you're thinking is not really how trades work too often. You trade away a position because you believe you have someone else that can fill those shoes typically for teams in contention, and a team like the Brewers are thinking minor rebuild so they won't die if they don't have an elite glove in center for a year or two"
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,PeregrinToke,2,Sun Jul 19 00:07:17 2015 UTC,If they get Upton it's most likely with the guarantee he signs with us
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,bmd4567,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"I like that thinking, but I dunno. He's pricey, and generally not worth the dollars anyway. We'll see. I'd take him at this point. If it's Gomez or Upton, doesn't matter. They're automatically the best hitter on the team."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Rules_row,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:42 2015 UTC,How is he not worth the money?
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,bmd4567,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"I feel as though he consistently under performs his contract since he's left Arizona. He started great in Atlanta, but was then marginally above average for the remainder of the contract."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Rules_row,4,Fri Jul 17 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"29 HRs 102 RBIs, .270/.342/.491 last year. I'd definitely sign up for that even if he is incredibly streaky, plus he's only 27."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Armani_Kimbo,5,Fri Jul 17 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"I'd sign up too, but I still think Gomez fits the team better. I'd still take either, but I think Gomez is a better piece, for a better price."

NewYorkMets,3dn57o,bmd4567,0,Sun Jul 19 14:13:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Duda has more power and gets on base more often. If Gomez could hit like Duda, he'd improve as a player. That's pretty straightforward. Gomez is obviously the better player, a much, much better defender, and an all-around better athlete, but he is not a better hitter."
NewYorkMets,3dn57o,Metsican,0,Sun Jul 19 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"Obviously they both have good track records, but both have been good but not great this year. Grandy and Duda both have better numbers offensively this season"

I completely agree that he has been better than Flores or Herrera this year. It's also clear that the Marlins, a team within our division, are not going to trade a middle infielder hitting .340 for trash.   He brought back the top left-handed pitching prospect in baseball before having his first half this year.

Gomez is a free agent after next season and Lagares will need Tommy John at some point in the near future. I could see them going after him, then shutting Lagares down for the next year or so to get better. At least this way we won't lose much if anything in defense and likely pick up an upgrade on the offensive side as well."

NewYorkMets,3dn6nt,tarhab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, Wieters' was a much more extensive tear. I don't remember where, but I'm positive that I've seen Lagares's recovery quoted at 6-8 months."
NewYorkMets,3dn6nt,sickgrof,5,Fri Jul 17 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"Does it really matter how big the tear is though? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the surgery replaces the whole ligament so I guess it wouldn't matter how bad the tear was if it's all getting removed anyways. Regardless, I would be more than happy if Lagares wasn't out for a whole year, but rather 6-8 months. I still think trading for Gomez or someone similar and shutting down Lagares would be a smart decision."
NewYorkMets,3dn6nt,rdeleon93,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:20 2015 UTC,You're exactly right. TJ requires replacement of the ligament; the tear size doesn't matter once surgery is decided on.

We have an EXCELLENT clubhouse, just what Puig would need. Donny Baseball isn't the type of guy Collins is either, Collins seems to be immensely better at reaching the young guys and spear heading player development.  I was discussing it in another thread, but I would sell almost the entire farm for Puig.

MLB doesn't give you a $25M loan because you need to add a new scoreboard, they do it so the team can make payroll for the next few months. That's the reason they took out bank loans and started selling those micro-percentage stakes of the team. Quick cash.   The Wilpons are in the real estate business. When the real estate market took a downturn in the mid 2000s, they needed to retain their existing property investments, but luckily for them they still had the Madoff returns to fall back on. Once that pyramid crumbled, they probably had a very limited access to cash. The money they make now from the team goes to paying back the loans they had to take out to remain solvent after Madoff. I do think once they pay off most of the loans they'll start investing in the team again, I just don't have any idea when that's going to be."

I do think once they pay off most of the loans they'll start investing in the team again, I just don't have any idea when that's going to be.   I think they're investing what they're clearing in revenue.  Which is growing little by little as the Mets get more buzz about them.  Very few owners in sports go into their pocket and use their personal funds to bankroll their teams at a loss.  When you take a $30-40M loss on the team three years in a row, it's very easy for fans to say, ""hey, just spend another $50M on top of that"", but that expense has to come from profits.  Even if you're worth 10 billion dollars, you can't just randomly outlay $50M or $100M and hope that you spark a revenue stream.  If you continue to lose (like the 2009-2010 Mets did, horribly), then you're out $80M rather than $30M.  The idea is to make this a more profitable business again, after what 20 years of reckless GMing did to make it NOT as profitable.  And that means win first, create revenue stream, augment payroll."
NewYorkMets,3dmnqc,three_dee,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"If they want to create revenue, make the playoffs. Once you're on the cusp of making the playoffs, the marginal revenue of each additional win is huge. I don't think anyone is really pissed they didn't spend $50M more in 2010. But this year it was clear we could compete. We didn't even have to spend an extra $50M, an extra 10 or 20 would have made a big difference if spent wisely. We would have kept our payroll at a very reasonable $120M with $25M coming off after this season.   There are some things that the Wilpons get shit for that are over the top.

The probelm is what a lot of people consider ""spending wisely"".  For example, if they expanded the payroll to take on Ian Desmond (11M) in a trade, or Alexei Ramirez (11M), or Jimmy Rollins (11M), or Stephen Drew, or especially Starlin Castro (53M), as a lot of people wanted them to do, it would have been an expensive, unmitigated disaster and they would probably be farther from contention than they are now because all of those guys have been terrible.

The guys Sandy acquired have combined for about 0 WAR. Some of it has been bad luck, but even without the bad luck I'm not sure that we'd be much higher than 1 or 1.5 WAR between them all. I think part of that is that we targeted people that cost less.  And I don't like the logic of not wanting to block Conforto. Acquire the best player available. If Conforto forces his way onto the team sooner than expected, you have a better player to trade to make room for him. Right now, we couldn't trade Cuddyer unless we ate some of the salary."

After the big contracts came off the books in 2011, they stopped investing in current payroll so that they could pay back the loans quicker.

NewYorkMets,3dmnqc,caldera15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Knicks and Nets pretty much both suck and have done nothing noteworthy in a long time, yet they still beat us out. Same with the Jets. It's due to being in New York, which is the main reason we are on this list.   I would say with Houston too that it's not just size but the fact that it's a very diverse and economically active area that makes it worth so much. The city is overbounded so ""fourth biggest"" should really read more like 10th which is still pretty big, but it's got unique geographical and demographic advantages that make it seem bigger. A place like Milwaukee has none of this and is one of the smallest metros with a major presence in pro-sports. I think they do quite well considering how small they are."
NewYorkMets,3dmnqc,escapingNihilism,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"also it's important to remember that Forbes is consistently outdone by the actual sale price of teams.  this is because an enormously wealthy person is going to be willing to pay higher than a theoretical ""market value"" (which is what Forbes is providing with these lists) in order to acquire a team.  think about the Clipper situation.  Steve Ballmer, who has $20 billion dollars or more, pays $2B because this is his chance.  it's a fucking toy for his retirement.  now -- how often do these sorts of people get the chance to buy a baseball franchise in New York?  I wouldn't be surprised if the Yankees sold for $5b or more."

But I'd have trouble believing Harvey or DeGrom will quite have the careers that Maddux and Glavine had. It's certainly possible, but those are literally two first ballot HOFers."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,mattjaydunn,12,Thu Jul 16 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"From 93-02 the Braves more often than not had four great pitchers in the rotation, and amazing accomplishment we are unlikely to duplicate. Avery was the other stud who flamed out unexpectedly after '93. So they replaced him with Neagle and then Millwood. Granted this was a bit of a side point with Maddux/Glavine/Smoltz being the anchors, but the thing that made those three great was their remarkable consistency over a long period. Made it easy for the front office to fill out the rest of the rotation with quality.   It might look like we are starting from an advantageous point with five studs from the farm (no need to sign a Maddux via FA!) but I'd consider us lucky if two of our guys pan out as ace types over the same period that the Braves rotation was great. More likely than not one guy will flame out ala Avery, possibly two. Then you have to consider with salaries being so high somebody will leave via free agency. The trick is not to bet big bucks on a guy who flames out.  Either way, the next few years should be great for us. Beyond that though, is anybody's guess. Pitching is so fickle, remember when the Giants had the great 1-2 of Cain-Lincecum? Or how about Verlander's slide into mediocrity? Even Kershaw has looked mortal this year."

NewYorkMets,3dka0y,three_dee,2,Fri Jul 17 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"Maddux and Glavine also both started pitching in the Majors at Age 20 and 21 respectively, with ages 21 and 22 being their first full/""real"" seasons. Harvey and Degrom made their debuts at ages 23 and 26 respectively.  If we look at each pitchers first 2 full seasons in the majors (with Harvey and deGrom's 2015's obviously not over yet), and look at some actual stats (not just W-L) we get the following:    Player Year Age W L ERA GS CG IP ER BB SO WHIP BB9 SO9    Maddux 1987 21 6 14 5.61 27 1 155.2 97 74 101 1.638 4.3 5.8   Maddux 1988* 22 18 8 3.18 34 9 249.0 88 81 140 1.249 2.9 5.1   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Glavine 1988 22 7 17 4.56 34 1 195.1 99 63 84 1.352 2.9 3.9   Glavine 1989 23 14 8 3.68 29 6 186.0 76 40 90 1.140 1.9 4.4   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Harvey 2013* 24 9 5 2.27 26 1 178.1 45 31 191 0.931 1.6 9.6   Harvey 2015 26 8 6 3.07 17 0 111.1 38 26 109 1.087 2.1 8.8   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   deGrom 2014 26 9 6 2.69 22 0 140.1 42 43 144 1.140 2.8 9.2   deGrom 2015* 27 9 6 2.14 17 0 113.2 27 21 112 0.924 1.7 8.9    *=All Star Selection  I'd like to lie, and say I can accurately analyze these stats, but frankly I'm just not smart enough. However, a few things that stand out are things like the Harvey/deGrom strikeout numbers, ERA, and the fact that Harvey/deGrom simply don't walk anyone. To be fair, at this part of his career Maddux hadn't developed his legendary control yet, and 1987 and 1988 are actually 2 of his worst years of his career in terms of walks.  All this being said... it's silly to compare this sort of thing with 2 guys who haven't even pitched 2 full seasons yet."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,Mazzocchi,3,Fri Jul 17 13:46:28 2015 UTC,It is completely unfair to ever judge a New York Met by his W/L record.  The ERA AND WHIP here say A LOT more than the W/L records.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,slappadabaess,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for creating these tables; they are beautiful. A couple of things I would point out (particularly to those who don't remember young Maddux/Glavine)...   Maddux and Glavine were, obviously, younger with less experience in their first two seasons. Maddux didn't really master his pinpoint control until his mid/late 20s, about the age that Harvey and deGrom are now. 1987 was a brutal year for pitchers; if you look at the leaguewide data, offense spiked that year. Those K/9 stats are pretty amazing, aren't they? Obviously Maddux and Glavine weren't the strikeout pitchers that Harvey/deGrom are (though Maddux is 10th and Glavine 24th among the all-time K leaders). But it was also a different environment, with strikeouts far more common today than in the late '80s. In fact, I think the strike zone itself is called bigger today than it was then, particularly the high strikes that power pitchers like Harvey and deGrom need."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,cheapdad,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that't the biggest difference. Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz got started earlier, and became great pitchers earlier, than the Mets' current starters."

NewYorkMets,3dka0y,sickgrof,0,Fri Jul 17 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"Anyone who was watching baseball from the late 80's will agree.  It isn't taking anything away from Harvey, deGrom or any of the Mets amazing arms.    It more about how much more the Braves arms had produced, using any metric - by age 26.  This makes it impossible for any of the Mets arms to catch up with the notable exception of Syndergaard (due to his age).  Do your own research.  Find a stat that shows Harvey or deGrom producing more than Maddux, Glavine or Smoltz by the same age."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,PhilipK_Dick,0,Fri Jul 17 22:48:25 2015 UTC,best case scenario  impossible   I don't think you know what any of these words mean.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,sickgrof,0,Fri Jul 17 23:17:16 2015 UTC,"So win-loss doesn't mean anything to you.  I suppose 355 wins doesn't say anything about a pitcher?  If you think it is possible for Matt Harvey or Jake deGrom to put up 104 WAR as a pitcher or put up a postseason WHIP of 1.242 in 13  postseasons.  How about finish in the top 5 in cy young voting in 9 seasons?  I'm not sure what ""best-case"" scenario you have in mind but I think it is impossible for Matt Harvey to produce as much in his career as either Maddux, Glavine or Smoltz  Please, tell me what a scenario is whereby any Mets pitcher has as productive a career as any of those 3 hall of fame pitchers?"

NewYorkMets,3dka0y,sickgrof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:54:22 2015 UTC,There are realities that most reasonable people include when calculating a best case scenario.  Does your literal best case scenario include 15 CY young awards in a row?  What I asked was to spell out your reasonable best case scenario that accounts for the fact that neither Mets pitcher has completed 2 MLB seasons by age 26.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,PhilipK_Dick,2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:08 2015 UTC,You don't think a career at Tom Glavine's level is a realistic best case scenario for either Harvey or deGrom?
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,sickgrof,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"I would say that being a first ballot hall-of-famer is a best case scenario.  I don't think he will have the time due to his injury history and style of current play to compile the statistical career that Glavine did.  That would be 6 top 3 CY Young finishes.  Seeing as how it is unlikely to happen this year, you are asking for Harvey to have 6 seasons as a top 3 pitcher from age 27 on.  That is extremely difficult.  Degrom at 27 may have a top 3 finish this season but there are a lot of great young pitchers in the game now.  But to concede to your point, although unrealistic, it is a best-case scenario and tht is what I asked you for.  Have an upvote!"
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,PhilipK_Dick,3,Sat Jul 18 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"Maddux's first season, he went 2-4 in 6 games. Second season, 6-14 in 30. ERA over 5 both years.   Last year, deGrom was 9-6 with a sub-3 ERA in 22 starts and won ROTY. This year, 9-6 so far in 17 starts with an ERA just over 2 and just turned in the most dominant performance any pitcher has ever had in the all star game.   Glavine started his career 2-4 in 9 games and the next year 7-17 in 34 starts, ERA over 5 and over 4.5, respectively. Harvey's first year, he was 3-5 in ten starts, then 9-5 in 26, and started the ASG. Sub-3 ERA both years.   What about deGrom and Harvey's first couple of seasons gives you any ""trouble believing"" that they might not have careers on par with Maddux and Glavine?"
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,gynoceros,3,Fri Jul 17 06:48:30 2015 UTC,Because the odds of him having a career like either of them is slim to none
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,SidBreamTrackTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:06:07 2015 UTC,"Well I doubt even Clayton Kershaw's career numbers being better than maddux's, let alone DeGrom or Harvey."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,mattjaydunn,2,Fri Jul 17 15:31:31 2015 UTC,There's a very strong chance you're right. The key to Maddux's long career was his tremendous longevity. The guy made 740 starts during his career. That's a crazy number. Kershaw's in his 8th season and is about a third of the way there. King Felix is in his 10th full season and is less than half way.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"Plus it'll be exponentially more difficult for any one of our guys to produce that same longevity due to the fact they throw almost all throw 96-100. Even though that'll lower as they age the injury risk you'd have to think is significantly higher, and that's not even acknowledging that Harvey, DeGrom, Matz and now Wheeler have had major procedures done."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,mattjaydunn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:26 2015 UTC,Great point. Glavine and Maddux were throwing low 90s most of the time and Glavine was even below that for a good chunk of his career.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,Metsican,8,Fri Jul 17 22:51:30 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Mets assemble ungodly good starting rotation to rival the Braves' dynasty rotation.    Step 2: Bloodthirsty fans rally behind their lord and savior Adam Rubin to try and convince the Mets to nuke previously mentioned rotation with a short sighted trade because of a couple months where TdA, Murphy, and Wright were injured and Duda, Flores, and Lagares all went into a simultaneous slump.    Step 3: Sandy decides not to be a damn idiot, takes his dog for a walk instead.    Step 4: The Mets turn into yearly playoff contenders for the next 5-10 years and have at least one pitcher in the top 3 in the NL Cy Young race every year.    Step 5: Profit."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,BillW87,5,Fri Jul 17 02:08:21 2015 UTC,Step 3 is the key?
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,Desertstarr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"Alternate step 3's:    -Holds press conference where he refuses to answer any questions not asked in pig latin and only gives his answers in swahili     -Starts speaking in tongues like this any time a NY Post beat writer asks him a dumb, leading question    -Learn to perform magic tricks like Michael Cuddyer. Except he only needs to learn one magic trick which is to make Michael Cuddyer disappear and not reappear in a Mets uniform again.    I mean, pretty much any of these are superior options to trading away once-in-a-decade farm products like Thor or Matz. I just want to make sure he knows the full range of options available to him so that he doesn't do something dumb like pull the trigger on the second Nolan Ryan or Tom Seaver trade in franchise history like so many people in our fanbase are suggesting he should do."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,BillW87,3,Fri Jul 17 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"I do think the Mets are going to make a trade or two here, but I don't think any of those guys are going anywhere.

I think it would take one of the rotation guys to get Pollock."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,three_dee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:02 2015 UTC,I would be ok with Wheeler + Nimmo for Pollock. The problem is the DBacks will never do that while Wheeler is out.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,sickgrof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:20:10 2015 UTC,"Upton and Zobrist are going to be hot commodities at the trade deadline even though they're just rentals. It certainly won't cost us a blue chip to get one of them, but I think a lot of people underestimate what the cost for either of those guys will end up being. Especially Zobrist who we'd be in a bidding war with the Yankees and Nationals for, among other teams. We have much better assets to offer than the Yankees since their farm system is pretty barren right now, but that doesn't mean they're not going to try to go big with their offers for him."
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,BillW87,7,Fri Jul 17 22:16:02 2015 UTC,And he's not even mentioning Wheeler who is likely to be better than ever when he gets back. The Mets starting rotation next year should be one of the best ever.
NewYorkMets,3dka0y,dukemantee,18,Fri Jul 17 00:15:45 2015 UTC,It could be and I'll be stoked if it is but I don't want to jinx it by making statements like that.

If just 4 out of harvey degrom syndergaard matz and Wheeler stay healthy together for the whole year, that itself is the best rotation in the bigs. My inherent mets pessimism tells me not to count on these guys staying healthy though, but if I'm wrong this will certainly be a historic rotation."

NewYorkMets,3djsbn,Agothro,2,Sat Jul 18 03:28:30 2015 UTC,Oh very interesting. My grandfather as well was a Dodgers fan; he wouldn't follow them when they moved and he refused to be a Yankees fan. So when the Mets came around ... Well here we are!
NewYorkMets,3djsbn,JTAC_Sean,2,Sat Jul 18 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"Well, personally, my grandfather grew up and followed the Dodgers, mainly because the family lived in Brooklyn after his father (my great grandfather)'s success. They were Dodger fans even after going to Queens until 1957, obviously. We still like the Dodgers over the Giants and such, but we don't really follow the Dodgers closely (they're our west coast team I guess). The Yankees will never be my or my family's favorite team for many reasons, but in the AL East (which I don't care about) I guess I'm OK with them winning. I don't really care.  1962, Mets. Finally NL is back in NY thanks to Shea. My father and his generation got the '69 world series (although he said to me he did not follow baseball intently yet, but got '73), '73's comeback year, and '86.

NewYorkMets,3dkdcr,splenda806,7,Thu Jul 16 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"Michael Conforto - 12th overall, 2nd best OF (only behind 20 y/o Nomar Mazara)   One of the most disciplined hitters in the minors, Conforto has improved as he has moved up the ladder. He's now facing pitchers in Double-A who can locate their off-speed stuff more effectively, and his ability to recognize those pitches and lay off ones just outside the zone separates him from most other hitters at that level. He's already an average defender in left with a grade-50 arm and could end up above-average out there, but it's the bat and the eye that separate him; he has an excellent chance at .400-OBP, 20-homer seasons when he peaks.   Dom Smith - 40th overall, 1st among 1B prospects   Smith has been scorching for more than two months; he leads the Florida State League in doubles and is fourth in batting average despite hitting just .220 with only one extra-base hit in April. He's an elite defender at first with a 70 arm, and he'll show plus raw power in batting practice, so I believe it'll come once he gets to a normal hitting environment in Binghamton. That should happen soon, but the Mets were very conservative with Conforto and might not move quickly enough with Smith, who has little left to prove in St. Lucie. In the meantime, Smith will need to work on his conditioning, as he has gotten heavier since signing."

I'm not calling him Keith Hernandez or Mark Grace, but a .300 hitter, gap power, and top glove were their traits.  If he could carry that type of play to the bigs there is plenty of room for him.

That was great for a few years, and I fondly remember listening to and watching some of those historic playoff runs. But after growing up some, I wasn't feeling like representing Boston. Didn't really feel like it was my team.

It's gonna cost at least one, maybe two, of Wheeler, Thor, Harvey, Matz, or deGrom.   You want Tulo? It will cost at least one, maybe two, of Wheeler, Thor, Harvey, Matz, or deGrom.  You want Braun? It will cost one, maybe two, of Wheeler, Thor, Harvey, Matz, deGrom.  What about Segura? Puig? Frazier? Yup, say goodbye to one or two of our big 5.  We have an abundance of elite pitching and a glaring weakness on offense. Teams see this and want to rob us. Sandy doesn't want to get robbed and I don't want to give up any of them for anyone. We have a potentially historic rotation for the next 4 years, there is no reason to blow it up on a 2015 that is unlikely to turn into much. I want those guys too but there is no way we get anything better than what we have now without breaking up our nasty young guns."

He's going to keep trying to prove that we're worse than the Phillies and that Sandy is literally the reincarnation of Hitler just to keep his narrative consistent regardless of what the team's record looks like. The sad part is that there's a huge audience for his bullshit because the casual fanbase for the Mets is so self loathing that they seem to want to have someone to spoon feed them tweets about how terrible their team is, even when it is 5 games above .500, 1 game back from a Wild Card Spot, 2 games back in the division, and a couple weeks away from getting their star catcher back from the DL who has an .820 OPS stretching back to late June of last year.

He would rent a present that's been used by another kid and wrap it in some nice wrapping paper to trick us. Then buy some cheap Made in Taiwan model of a toy you really wanted. Youd be disappointed but you can't just look a gift horse in the mouth. Maybe the other kids won't notice your cheap knockoff? Thank goodness he's an expert craftsman though and can build you some nice toys. They wont be ready very quickly but at least they're nice toys.  Unfortunately, when you talk to the other kids at the playground and want to trade toys, they want like 3 of the toys Sandy Claus made for one of their high tech toys their much richer parents bought. Its not fair and we probably should just accept our homemade toys and hope they become valuable eventually."

NewYorkMets,3di30j,jordansideas,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, we're kind of going around in circles, but the 85-win pace encompasses the entire season.  Almost all of which has been played without these 3 guys we're talking about (8 from Wright, 19 from d'Arnaud, 2 from Matz).  How could it not go up (even if slightly) if those guys played the rest of the season in full?"
NewYorkMets,3di30j,three_dee,0,Thu Jul 16 19:05:33 2015 UTC,If you look at that way with injured players coming back the Mets could play at a 131 win pace the rest of the way.   Basically I'm saying f paces. The Mets followed no predicted pace in 2007 in September. Anything can happen at anytime.

NewYorkMets,3dfysp,bmd4567,14,Wed Jul 15 23:40:01 2015 UTC,hes 35 and past his prime i think and he has maybe 3 good years left tops and if we over pay for him we will regret it later on
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,joeydeno,20,Wed Jul 15 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"If we got him, it'd be as a rental, so it doesn't really matter how many years he has left as long as he has a few months left.  If Zobrist can push us over the edge for the playoffs, I'd want him 100%. The playoffs have a lot of luck in terms of advancing, and you have an even better chance if you have great 1-4 starters, even if the rest of your team is mediocre. If the Mets have one thing over most teams, it's their top starting pitchers.  All that said, Zobrist would likely be a great move if he doesn't cost Nimmo or Conforto."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,eyerollz,8,Wed Jul 15 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we have more pitching than we know what to do with so why not turn that into some offense. Even if it's just a short term upgrade."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Davy_Grolton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:04 2015 UTC,Get rid of young phenom pitching to get a guy in his mid thirties and maybe make the first round of the playoffs for one year.  This is a terrible decision.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,AtlasRodeo,5,Thu Jul 16 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"The prospect we would give for Zobrist wouldn't be a phenom, and nowhere in my comment did I say we should give up any of the big arms."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Davy_Grolton,0,Thu Jul 16 13:08:29 2015 UTC,I don't think Ben Zobrist will help the Mets any more than whoever he replaces.  He's basically Michael Cuddyer.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,pnoozi,11,Thu Jul 16 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"He's basically Michael Cuddyer.   If you think this about Zobrist, you really don't know Zobrist then. He's nothing like Cuddyer. Much better defensively, can play more positions, is a natural infielder, much less injury prone, not much worse with the bat (compared to Cuddyer's career, he's much better than Cuddy has been this year). Zobrist would definitely be an upgrade over Cuddyer.  Besides, acquiring Zobrist would not likely be a replacement/upgrade over one player. He would probably play 2B, SS, 3B, and corner OF. Meaning one of Flores, Tejada, or Cuddyer could be moved to the bench, and the other two could be given regular rest along with Murphy and Granderson."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,eyerollz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with the previous poster that he's Michael Cuddyer, but not in the negative light he meant it.  I think signing Michael Cuddyer was good FO thinking, and he was hitting well until he got hurt, which was always the big risk.  I think Cuddyer's a solid hitter and so's Zobrist."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,three_dee,2,Thu Jul 16 05:03:09 2015 UTC,"He's closer to McCutchen than he is to Cuddyer. I don't even know where you guys get this. ITT there is so much nonsense about what Zobrist offers as a player, it's like half of you haven't followed baseball in a decade."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,2,Thu Jul 16 08:24:31 2015 UTC,"The positive things I can say about him are he hits a lot of doubles, has a nice OBP, and supposedly is a good fielder.  How this makes him closer to McCutchen than Cuddyer I don't know."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,pnoozi,2,Thu Jul 16 09:29:09 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating when people comment in threads without even looking at the page that was linked. Go up top, click on the link, and look at the chart. Or you can just look at it here."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"It's kind of disingenuous to use that chart and say ""Zobrist is close to McCutchen."" Zobrist is 35 and is never going to play at the 8-WAR pace he played at in 2009 when McCutchen was a rookie.   People are underrating him in this thread, but I think it's overly optimistic to expect anything more than a ~3 WAR bat and solid defense from him over the next couple of years.   For the Mets lineup that is obviously an upgrade, but it's also not worth overpaying for. Kind of a moot point anyway, as Sandy is pretty conservative and isn't going to go after anyone that might be considered an overpay in the first place."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,JC915,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"Any idea why his WAR is so high?  Is it his defense?  Because offensively he's not on pace for much this year.  The article says he ""does a lot of things well"" which is true.  But the Mets don't need someone who does a lot of things well, they need someone who can do one thing extremely well - hit.  I don't think Zobrist would have a great impact on the Mets."

NewYorkMets,3dfysp,madisonfootball99,3,Thu Jul 16 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why you're framing it as ""failing"" though.  Every single trade we have made over the last 3 years has been a landslide in favor of the Mets.  His track record is amazing in trades.  Surely it's possible he doesn't become a Met, but I don't get why (a) that would be a ""failure"" (who is Ben Zobrist, Babe Ruth now?  He's a nice player), or (b) why you expect failure to happen especially with trades with our current GM who basically robs the shit out of everybody."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,three_dee,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:35 2015 UTC,If not getting Zobrist in a trade is a failure for a GM there are a lot of failures out there. He's a player that would legitimately help just about every team that's in contention
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,roby6907,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:24 2015 UTC,"If the A's are insistent on getting a top 15 prospect, then perhaps we deal one of our lower tier guys, like Fulmer or Urena. The point here is that we need at least one guy to help shoulder the offensive load, and waiting until TdA and Wright come back is not going to help us at all. At the very least, what we have to do is hope to acquire cheap, but effective bats. I heard Juan Uribe was a consideration, but that may just be speculation."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,giobbistar21,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"Why would this be the guy we overpay for? If I'm Alderson, I'm not giving up much value if we're getting back an older utility player that will be with us for 3 months."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Undercover_Mop,3,Thu Jul 16 01:56:12 2015 UTC,Look up Zobrist. He's a LOT better than you are giving him credit for being. He's a switch-hitting on-base machine with tremendous positional flexibility who would immediately improve our 3B and RF situation.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"I know about Zobrist. He's a very underrated player. But he isn't someone who I'd overpay for because he is still exactly what I said: an older utility player with two months left on his contract. I don't want to give up legitimate potential major league players for him. If we were a WS contender then yes, overpay for him. But as of right now, we aren't in a position to overpay for someone like that."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't we give up potential Major Leaguers for a proven Major Leaguer? Are you familiar with the concept of ""win curves""?"
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:42 2015 UTC,Because we'll have this major league for 2 months. Why give up substantial value for someone who is gone in a few months? That's terrible asset management.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Undercover_Mop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"That perspective ignores a lot of really important financial implications because it ignores the opportunity costs. If the Mets are an 86 win team, a player bumping them to 88 wins could be worth in the tens of millions of dollars this year because it would be the difference between essentially 0% playoff odds and close to 100% playoff odds. That's the difference between the team being able to afford name brand free agents in the fall and ""shopping in the frozen vegetables section"". Your statement also assumes that the trade pieces will definitely become above average Major League contributors when in reality, that really doesn't seem to be accurate.  It's pretty safe to say 2 months of Zobrist would be worth 2 wins over Michael ""negative value"" Cuddyer. It's good to have lots of prospects but most of your prospects don't pan out most of the time. You need to know when to sell high."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:40 2015 UTC,Picking up less than 4 million dollars isn't overpaying. Isn't Cuddyer making more than double that this year?

NewYorkMets,3dfysp,UnemployedBoredom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:17:42 2015 UTC,Which arm? Would Cessa do it? I'd do Cessa and Nimmo for him without hesitation but even that sounds light.

He's putting it all together and it's nice to see, but we have so much young pitching either on the team now or in the minors.  Not every pitcher will make an impact on the Mets and we do have to get rid of one or two if we want to acquire a bat."

NewYorkMets,3dfysp,frakking-anustart,2,Thu Jul 16 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I'd say Conforto is our one untouchable prospect unless we're getting someone like Frazier who's both very very good and under control for a couple years. If Alderson traded him for a couple months of Zobrist I'd be shocked
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,roby6907,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"Do you really think the owners will want to give up talent, plus pay the $3.75 million left on his salary for the year?"
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Zthulu,4,Thu Jul 16 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"give up talent     That's the kicker. Sandy likes his prospects and we've seen that he's generally unwilling to pull the trigger on prospect-for-major leaguer trades, usually preferring to trade in the opposite direction.     pay the $3.75 million left     I know the Wilpons have a reputation for pinching pennies, but there's no way they're going to get hung up on $3.75 million for a guy of Zobrist's caliber. Especially not since they theoretically got somewhere around $6 million back from the insurance on Wright's contract already this year. The Wilpons have been cheap about spending on teams they don't think will contend, but I don't think they're complete idiots. A playoff appearance would bring in a huge amount of money for them, and if they think Zobrist would be the difference between making the playoffs and not making the playoffs they aren't going to let $3.75m get in the way."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,BillW87,0,Thu Jul 16 02:34:49 2015 UTC,We can easily outbid the Yankees. They don't really have anyone outside of Judge and Severino (they have a few solid guys but no one else that level.) We could start with Nimmo and then we'd be in the clear.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Senor_Met,15,Thu Jul 16 00:44:32 2015 UTC,Not nimmo for a 3 month rental. That hurts to see.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Desertstarr,2,Thu Jul 16 02:13:30 2015 UTC,Nimmo profiles as a 4th outfielder. He can't hit lefties - never has - and can't stick in CF. His upside is a bit better than Nieuwenhuis. We should trade him with zero hesitation.
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,3,Thu Jul 16 08:21:26 2015 UTC,"If Nimmo, our 2nd best position player(and prospect) is only a 4th outfielder with not much upside. Then our farm system is barren and empty."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Desertstarr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:07:14 2015 UTC,"Nimmo isn't our 2nd best position player prospect. Conforto and Herrera are well ahead of him. I'd put Rosario ahead of him as well, and there are probably people I am forgetting. Nimmo seems like a great guy but truthfully, he hasn't hit lefties at all in the Minors, doesn't play strong enough defense to stick in CF, and definitely hasn't shown the type of power you expect from a corner outfielder.  Kirk Nieuwenhuis had better numbers at AA at the same age. That's a fact:    Nieuwenhuis  Nimmo"
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"And Kirk just hit three dingers in a game, so what's your point???  Kidding, I agree that we should sell high on Nimmo while he's still considered a top ~75 prospect."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,JC915,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:43 2015 UTC,Ok I definitely disagree with that
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Senor_Met,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:38 2015 UTC,"I've watched him play. It's what the numbers show. It's his likely outcome. He can start hitting for more power and get on base more often, but if you compare his numbers to other Major League outfielders when they were playing at that level, he's been distinctly unimpressive. He'll need to improve pretty significantly. Not saying he won't, but his bust potential is very high."
NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,2,Thu Jul 16 15:20:27 2015 UTC,Gotta give up someone.

NewYorkMets,3dfysp,Metsican,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"The early rumors had straight Ynoa for Zobrist. Now that half the league wants him, this seems like a more realistic deal."

A ball and AA so far. But he's been in AA for two months. He has shown how good he can be but I'm not sold he can be a MLB player yet. I would rather sit out this year where we are, try to sign a big FA bat (just one), and start Conforto in AAA next year primed for a June call up. There's no reason to bring him up and risk his progression. That's what we used to do and I don't want to go back to those days of having to rely on older over the hill players to win. Conforto should end the year on AAA and try to make the team out of Spring next year. I also think we should only trade Niese/Gee/Colon if we can get some prospects who will be ready next year or a decent bar for the OF."
NewYorkMets,3djnul,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:41 2015 UTC,Which big bat are you interested in?
NewYorkMets,3djnul,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:15:17 2015 UTC,Upton. I think he fills a need where we can play Grandy and Cuddy a little more sparingly (even toss one of their expiring deals in the trade) and provides the first real consistent power threat since Beltran. We should only do this if we're really in the hunt though. If we're more than 5 games back I say we just tow the line and stick it out till FA. Second choice would be Braun of we can pry him away for not much. I honestly want to just stick with what we have. If we have to deal any of our big 5 in against it.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:42 2015 UTC,So you're gonna give Upton a big contract and then trade one of Conforto or Nimmo?
NewYorkMets,3djnul,sickgrof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:24:53 2015 UTC,"No. Not at all. Maybe Nimmo. But I'd be 100% fine if our OF a majority of next year is Upton, Lagares, Conforto. Nimmo can be used as a fine little trade piece to nab a SS."

NewYorkMets,3djnul,sickgrof,0,Fri Jul 17 00:34:11 2015 UTC,I said maybe Nimmo. With Lagares' penchant for getting hurt and his serious lack of hitting ability anything can happen. Keeping Nimmo for as long as possible isn't a bad thing and can only help his value unless he tanks in the coming years. I wouldn't deal Conforto but I'm ok dealing Nimmo.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:46:55 2015 UTC,I don't think we should go after him in free agency but he wouldn't look bad there if we could get him cheap for the second half.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:07 2015 UTC,I think we should go hard after him in free agency. Its been 7 years since the Wilpons spent money and I think any trade for him involved at least one of our big 5. Likely Thor. I don't want to trade any of our nasty young guns for Upton and that's probably what it would take.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:30:03 2015 UTC,It's not that I don't like Upton; I'd rather spend more money and get the better player in Heyward or spend less money and get a better player in Gordon.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:10 2015 UTC,heyward all the way. he's the superior defender. younger with a higher ceiling. though i like upton too.
NewYorkMets,3djnul,kriheli,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:52:55 2015 UTC,"The team needs to trade for 2 players. An infielder(SS) and outfielder. If they trade for those players, then I too would prefer for Conforto to stay down there. But the outfield needs help and I do not have faith in Kirk Or Darrel to hold down the fort out there offensively.   Also if you think about it, LV numbers are stupidly inflated. I am sure Conforto can get some good reps there but other than that what will he learn? I do think triple A is an important step, but I should hope Conforto is not that fragile that comming up now would destroy him if he does poorly."
NewYorkMets,3djnul,wschneider,2,Thu Jul 16 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"He's going to learn to hold a bat against slightly older competition, and more importantly pitchers who can throw breaking balls for strikes."
NewYorkMets,3djnul,the_furry_stoner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:23:48 2015 UTC,"Which is something he will have to re-learn at MLB level. There is a reason why we have several AAAA players.  Because they learned how to hit AAA pitches, but never learned how to hit MLB pitches."
NewYorkMets,3djnul,Metsican,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"We can't trade for either of those things without giving one of our big pitchers, maybe 2. I would do anything to keep these 5 together. Conforto can be the answer next year but he won't make,enough of a difference this year to risk it. Unless he Mike Trouts which is very unlikely. We need to hold out until the off-season and try to sign an Upton, Cespedes, Gordon, Heyward, or maybe Span. Unless we get a very friendly deal for some lower level guys and a starter that isn't the big 5, we should stick with what we have. Getting D'Arnaud and maybe Wright back would do wonders. Even if it's just d'Arnaud."

We should really be in the fundies camp with Keith. Give me the best defensive SS on the market."

When Dilson replaces Herrera at 2B and Flo replaces Murphy at 3rd, it will get even better."

Conforto's looked great, but it's still AA pitching. Most of the guys there still can throw breaking balls for strikes consistently, which Conforto takes advantage of because of his great plate discipline. But jumping from AA to the show would be a hell of a leap."
NewYorkMets,3djnul,Metsican,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly if we can't get Zorbist for what ever pitching prospects we have in the system, then i say we wait for the off season and do something then.

NewYorkMets,3djnul,OlerudsHelmet,0,Fri Jul 17 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"""Have to""?  No, they don't. They have enough players to fill a roster.   If the FO doesn't make a trade its because they have counted out making the postseason this year. In that case, its a waste to burn his service time in the Majors when he hasn't even been to AAA yet. Do we not remember what happened the last time the Mets promoted a guy straight from AA? [EDIT: My bad - Morris actually came up from High A. I still hold my argument by rephrasing it as ""Do we not remember what happened the last time the Mets promoted a guy too early""?]  If they do make a trade, its going to be to address the needs of this team. One of those needs is the OF. If we trade for an outfielder, for example, then bringing up Conforto to rot on the bench or risk being shell-shocked by early career struggles is exactly the thing you would not want to do."

It's the same situation with Blevins and the Nationals in 2014 that just confused the hell out of me. This is 2015 where any person with access to the internet can tell you within 2 minutes what a relief pitcher's L/R splits are, yet somehow people who are actually paid money to decide which pitchers face which batters can't seem to grasp the basic concept that left handed pitchers who historically can't get right handed batters out for shit probably shouldn't be brought into games to face more than 3x as many right handed hitters as left handed ones. You shouldn't get angry at your fork when it does a crappy job of helping you eat soup, and you shouldn't get angry at a LOOGY for struggling to get right handed batters out. Pick the right tools for the right job."

We could get swept by the Nats and it means nothing other than an obvious drop in the standings short term. Our August/Sept schedules are easy. It's up to us, not how we fair simply against the Nats alone."

Sorry to give you my negative opinion, but the Nationals are a big part of our playoff hopes.  Playing the phillies can only do so much, we eventually have to beat the real teams in baseball, with consitency.  The Nationals and Marlins are those teams that we need to beat in order to earn our playoff birth. It is where we find out if we are that team we claim to be."
NewYorkMets,3ddpme,Desertstarr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"That's just not true. We have 12 more games against the Nats here on out. Yes, if we're gonna have hopes of winning the division, obviously we're going to need to fair well against them in this span, but look at our schedule. In August there's 3 games with the Marlins, 3 against the Rays, 7 against the Rockies, 3 against the Red Sox and 4 against the Phillies. I guess i just see things differently. Nats are the team to be if we want to win this division, but the wild card is really about all these other teams when it comes down to it."

We already lost 7 of 7 to the Cubs. 1-11 in division would be tough. The Wild Card is probably a tougher path and that happened last year.. How many times can they swamp us? The bats have to come oit a bit eventually. Yes, of course the Nats are better this year but if we're pitching this good and losing 11 of 12 to the Nats.. I know anything's possible but I don't want to see them look into the playoffs like that. I think they'll show some heart this time around though. Especially if we can get a little bit healthier."

Yes, the bats need to get hotter but I really don't see a big time collapse headed our way. If anything, we'll be holding on and we'll finish just outside.  BUT hands down the series with the Nationals that is upcoming is the biggest test for this team so far this year. I'm actually happy we are playing the Cardinals beforehand as a warm up just so we can go into the Nationals series warmed up."

The depth of pitching we have is a lot more solid and much less apt to shriveling up and breaking apart like the offenses of previous year.   We will probably have to face Scherzer in the finale of the set though. But we beat him once before.

We got red hot before the break as usual, but it shows that we do have the talent to win the games. We've had some tough games in the first half that could have really gone either way. Gotta figure things will balance out and we'll win some close ones that do go our way in the second half. I love the pitching staff and we have young guys that show flashes of greatness.   We definitely need a Piazza type move to put us over the top to contender status because if we make the playoffs anything can happen with this pitching. If it's spending money to get a rental, then hopefully the Wilpons will sign the check. If we could get Justin Upton somehow in the offseason, or a trade / extension, that would put us over the top."

If we get TDA back, which looks possible since he may start rehab soon, really just adding a good lefty platoon bat is enough. Gerardo Parra, David Peralta, Will Venable would all be huge additions to the team and wouldn't be that costly. With TDA and a lefty platoon bat starting in left, the offense could be just quite not bad enough to sneak into the playoffs"

NewYorkMets,3dbznl,xmarcs,3,Wed Jul 15 02:52:57 2015 UTC,I agree 100% man. Marketing and hype sell and Harvey was that product. I think deGrom likes not being in the spotlight though (but his performance tonight might prove me wrong).
NewYorkMets,3dbznl,Skiigga,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:05:17 2015 UTC,Harvey was the OG but he's undoubtedly been easiest to convince me with. Always thought JdG would struggle with his sophomore year. Couldn't be happier to be wrong!

NewYorkMets,3dbznl,sgr0gan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"1) That was one of the more incredible things I have ever watched, not only because of how nasty he was but because it was over so quick  2) Not related to the ASG, but if the Wilpons don't shell out some cash for a little bit of offense and then a lotta cash to keep these pitchers together, I think it will actually be a crime against humanity, not even just baseball. In an era dominated by power pitching, the Mets have the motherload and for the team's owners to potentially waste one of the premiere opportunities to be a powerhouse would be tragic  3) Being a Mets fan and knowing the Coupons way of running the team, I'm trying to emotionally ready myself for this tragedy to occur...not sure I can do it"
NewYorkMets,3dgaal,joeydeno,6,Thu Jul 16 01:12:18 2015 UTC,This season probably only deGrom...  In the future maybe even all of them. Maybe not Wheeler or Matz
NewYorkMets,3dgaal,bmd4567,6,Thu Jul 16 01:17:57 2015 UTC,Why not Matz?
NewYorkMets,3dgaal,Metsican,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:07 2015 UTC,Idk... I feel like it's cheating if all five of our starters have Cy Young ability

NewYorkMets,3dgaal,lemonmop,3,Thu Jul 16 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"deGrom is definitely in the running. In terms of fWAR he's only barely behind Greinke and a fair amount behind Scherzer. I think bWAR is the opposite. He doesn't have the flashy ERA of the former or the almost no-hitter almost perfect game streak of the latter, but the season's only halfway over and he looks like he's just heating up.  Odds are though no."

NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,islesandpizza,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:01:53 2015 UTC,Damn I was just remembering last night that year he had 124 RBI's. That's insane
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,iamleobn,7,Wed Jul 15 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"If you needed to pick a Met after Piazza, it's definitely Wright because there isn't much other competition. That being said, I don't think as of right now, 2015, he's made the same impact on the franchise as Doc or Straw."
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,islesandpizza,10,Wed Jul 15 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by ""impact""? Wright played four different seasons at MVP level, that sounds like a lot of impact to me. Not his fault the team around him sucked most of the time."
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,thestral_rider,4,Wed Jul 15 01:10:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how to describe what I mean. It's the reason you don't can tell when someone is a HOFer while they're playing but they aren't inducted until after their career is over.    I know the teams he's played on haven't been very great, but when we look back at this era in Mets history ten years from now, then we can say what his impact on the franchise was. It's just more of a qualitative thing in my mind, I guess."
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,avatar_aang_,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:16:20 2015 UTC,I think that both Koosman and Gooden actually belong in the HOF in blue and orange. There's no way I can rationalize having someone who I don't think belongs in the HOF in the Mets franchise four over these two guys.
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,mji6980-4,8,Wed Jul 15 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"How do people feel about Wright?  As a younger guy, it's almost hard for me to imagine a Mets without him.  But people on the Facebook page are quite convinced he shouldn't have been voted in."
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,dblydenburgh,23,Wed Jul 15 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that you can break up Mets history into four eras.  60s/70s - Seaver  80s - I'd probably say Doc, but Keith won  90s/Early 00s is Piazza  And from 2005 to now it's been Wright, so those would be my 4."
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,roby6907,3,Wed Jul 15 00:17:41 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I voted
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,BitterBosh,13,Wed Jul 15 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Wright has been vastly underrated by the average fan. Lots of people think he's been washed up since citi field was built despite him having a couple of his best years in citi. I would guess those are the people that are shocked he made it. I can understand if you think Doc should be there over him (although I would pick Wright), but thinking he doesn't belong in the conversation is ludicrous"
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,roby6907,8,Wed Jul 15 00:23:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. Though I think I'd take Doc over Keith. But Keith was a great leader & face for the franchise. Tough choice.
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,BitterBosh,6,Wed Jul 15 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen people say Doc, Straw, and Carter in that spot instead of Keith too. I would pick Keith since he's still affiliated with the team in such a big way though"

NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,resident16,3,Wed Jul 15 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people can think Wright doesn't deserve this. He's the franchise leader in hits, which should put his ""Franchise Significance"" above that of any hitter with the exceptions of Kieth and Piazza, who already appear on the list. Kieth and Piazza are both great Mets, and definitely deserve their placement. But they both earned their stripes elsewhere and came to the Mets. David will go down as the best life long Met, more likely than not"
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,escapingNihilism,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:46 2015 UTC,He's the franchise leader in hits   And like fifteen other categories. The dude is basically the hitting equivalent of Seaver for the team.

NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,ThatDoodch,2,Wed Jul 15 05:17:47 2015 UTC,I'd probably take out Keith and put in Gooden. Every time an arm comes up he's referenced.
NewYorkMets,3dbh2x,mauripj,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:44 2015 UTC,Got 3/4 right with Gooden replacing Hernandez but I can't complain. Solid four.

Once he gained access to the team (presumably through being acquired by SNY), he began to present himself as a reporter (see: mimicking Ken Rosenthal by beginning every other sentence with ""that said,""), reference ""team officials"" as sources for things that rarely came to fruition, and totally shifted the tone of the blog (I'm sure plenty like it, i just prefer the old tone.) Also, the fact that he quotes himself as a reference in articles about trade rumors always makes me take pause. It reads as if he's a little boy saying ""SEE!!! I TOLD YOU SO!""  The other thing that's gotten out of hand is how many times they post the same ""stories"" with minor/non updates.   I found it more fun when it was just a fan with a hobby.

It's telling that they had him go from A-ball to AAA in the span of 2 seasons (2012 & 2013).

Although to be fair he was inconsistent enough in the minors to warrant that and like deGrom just put it all together when he got called to the show.

NewYorkMets,3dc30a,BottomNine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:14:27 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that these scouting reports were also written before the Mets' pitcher development staff transformed into a power pitcher factory. Not enough can be said about the work that Dan Warthen, Frank Viola, and others have done to help transform these guys.  Yes, Wheeler, Matz, Syndergaard, Harvey, and deGrom have always had talent but it's the organization that helped unlock it. Teams like the Orioles and Rockies have drafted plenty of guys high on raw talent but have not gotten these kinds of results."

Thank you for saying things like ""the injuries caught up to the Mets"" rather than the flat out nonsense such as ""the Mets roster is subpar and incomplete."" Nothing peeves me more than when people make statements about Sandy/our roster when we're being forced to start guys like Soup, Recker, Plaw, Ceciliani, Kirk, and Herrera due to a shitstorm of injuries that no one saw coming and is by the far the most severe in the MLB. It simply isn't fair. Sandy did a fine job building a roster for 2015, he just couldn't help the fact that everyone and their mom got injured for extended periods of time...

They have a pretty strong argument that they're able to put a winning product on the field with the payroll they're currently at, seeing as the Mets are a winning team at the moment. The push to force the Wilpons to sell the team had good leverage a couple years ago when we were a 74 win team, but when we're on pace for 85/86 wins it's an impossible sell to convince the Commissioner's office that the Wilpons should be forced to sell the team. Hell, nobody's hijacking the Commissioner's Q&A to demand that the Phillies get sold to new ownership and they already have 62 losses at the break. Mets fans are just going to have to accept that the Wilpons aren't going anywhere for at a minimum several years while this team is riding the current crop of young, cost-controlled players to winning seasons."

Ownership has not done its job.  The 2015 Phillies are the 2010 Mets.  They aren't even bad with a purpose like the Astros were.  They're just terrible with little hope in sight.  If you think ""ownership""s job is to stand there holding a checkbook and cluelessly throw a bunch of money at gaping wounds in the organization, then you are going to... end up with the 2010 Mets and 2015 Phillies over and over.  What they need to do is what the Mets did over the past 4 years -- recognize that they are a comically expensive mess, with no silver lining even in sight on the horizon.  And that throwing money at the problem won't help until they position themselves to a place where it matters.   If they have failed, it is by putting in place shitty GM and President.   That's certainly part of the problem.  But it's a problem because they hired a guy who only knows how to throw lots of money at bad players.  (Like the last three or four Mets' GMs.)  It's fair to say that the Mets, this season, have a chance at a playoff spot.  If they achieve that, they will have exactly the same number of playoff teams under the current GM as they did under Minaya (1).  It's hard for me to get my mind around the argument people make where the Wilpons are somehow doing a worse job now than they were doing in like 2008-2009."

I don't understand it, unless you meant personality wise maybe?   They never get the A+ talent, they go cheap and get the secondary and the lesser star.   The Mets had the 2nd-to-6th highest payroll in MLB every year from when the Wilpons became principal owners (2002) to when Alderson was hired.  Cheapness is not your primary point of attack here.  What they did wrong during that era was not cheapness or brokeness.  It was having shitty, terrible GMs who could not identify good players to spend the money on.   Also please don't take me to task on arod's steroids or griffey's decline.   Well, I think they should have signed A-Rod too, so I won't take you to task for that.

So they're still stuck with all their trade chips pissing away value playing for the worst team in baseball and they're STILL that bad. Even worse? Their farm system coming into the season was ranked 21st in the majors by Baseball America, meaning there isn't hope on the way either. Not a single one of their minor league affiliates finished over .500 last year, not one. They're a shitty major league team without the means to become less shitty in their farm. It's been clear for a few years now that the Phillies ship was sinking, but RAJ was so determined to squeeze every last drop of trade value out of his players that he ended up getting no value for them because no GMs around the league are willing to play ball with the price he asks for his players so they've just been stuck watching guys with fading value keep fading. They needed to blow things up and start rebuilding 2-3 years ago when that was still an option on the table. Now they just need to pray that they can draft well enough over the next few years to get back to .500 by 2020."

I don't think the Wilpons need to go (although I wouldn't be upset if they do), but they almost certainly have more pressing financial concerns than fielding a WS team. They may just be content with the bare minimum, which this team will almost certainly give them for the next few years at least.

If you get in, you have a shot.  Especially with what would surely be the best pitching staff 1 through 4 in the majors.  Other teams may have better 1-2s (but not by all that much), but nobody matches our depth.  Getting there is the hard part.

NewYorkMets,3d9bii,beckett360,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well, we're ranked 28th in offense right now.  You can go ahead and blame Omar for that if you want.  How about Nelson Cruz?"
NewYorkMets,3d9bii,Metsican,3,Tue Jul 14 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Well, we're ranked 28th in offense right now. You can go ahead and blame Omar for that if you want.   I have a better idea... maybe we can blame the #1, #3 and #4 best hitters on the team being on the DL for practically the entire season.   How about Nelson Cruz?   Did the Mets recently get the go-ahead to use the DH in the NL?  Or do you enjoy fly balls turning into doubles by the bucketload?"
NewYorkMets,3d9bii,escapingNihilism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:36:46 2015 UTC,Nelson Cruz is a DH. The Mets play in the NL. Not a fit.
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,Rules_row,9,Tue Jul 14 15:22:34 2015 UTC,"This name, it sounds so familiar to me. Like a long, lost friend."
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,resident16,7,Tue Jul 14 17:21:07 2015 UTC,He Lives!!!
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,Desertstarr,2,Tue Jul 14 17:10:54 2015 UTC,This could be very important because it might allow the Mets to move Niese.
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,yfern0328,2,Tue Jul 14 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"As usual there is no announcement he is alive, just news trickling up through twitter and reddit. Glad to hear he's back."
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,islesandpizza,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:14 2015 UTC,he'd be a nice addition
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,MikelHunt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"This is good news, especially considering I didn't know he was back to playing at all yet. I guess I missed that announcement. Hopefully he'll be able to come back up soon"
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,dualcamelkid,3,Tue Jul 14 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there wasn't any official announcement."
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,dualcamelkid,4,Tue Jul 14 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"Well that would certainly be typical, wouldn't it? I guess it's better than them saying, ""He'll be back in 2 weeks"" every other week for 3 months"
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,ShazamDC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"Any chance he'll be back in time by the 22nd? Probably not, but if so, he could be the 6th man to replace Matz"
NewYorkMets,3d9gig,Metsican,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"As a starter, there's no chance since he'd take longer than that to get stretched out. I'm not sure if they see him as a reliever or a starter, though."
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,Desertstarr,13,Tue Jul 14 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see Kevin on Fox sports things, I feel like a parent watching their little man all grown up and feeling excited for him."
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,PKMKII,2,Wed Jul 15 00:53:00 2015 UTC,"He is old style,  i expect this sort of shoot from the hip no bull style from someone his age."
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,bfonville,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"yep, I love it"
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,bfonville,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"Mets ""Franchise Four""  David Wright Mike Piazza Keith Hernandez Tom Seaver"
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,thestral_rider,3,Tue Jul 14 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"I know we've already had this thread, but Wright and Hernandez should have been replaced by Koosman and Gooden."
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,thestral_rider,0,Tue Jul 14 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"It's despicable that Rose is part of the All-Star game festivities. He took a life time ban from the game over having MLB continue its investigation. There is an argument to be made about the HOF since he didn't know that they would definitely reject him, but he knew he wouldn't be involved in any MLB events. To those who think he's suffered enough, he agreed to his punishment."
NewYorkMets,3dbb8z,spinel_sky,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:04 2015 UTC,All < Money
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,BottomNine,11,Tue Jul 14 22:45:10 2015 UTC,how about rookie of the year Noah Syndergaard??
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,MikelHunt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:54:13 2015 UTC,Very true can't argue with that one
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,three_dee,4,Tue Jul 14 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"Familia has been great, but the MVP is still Duda IMO.  Without him, we would have had a lot more 1-0 and 2-1 losses, and fewer 4-2 and 3-1 wins."
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,see_mohn,3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"Gold Glove: Oddly, Duda. Lagares has been great, but Duda's been astoundingly solid at first.  MVP: Familia.   Cy: deGrom."
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,Empire48,5,Wed Jul 15 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"CY Young:  Jacob DeGrom; Our most consistent pitcher and has been the ace of the staff this year  MVP:  Jacob DeGrom; Nobody on offense deserves MVP so defaulted to Jacob.  Rookie of the Year:  Thor  Comeback Player:  Dark Knight; to come back from a full year off and pitch as well as he has, he deserves this.  He isn't what we saw in 2013 but he is close.  Gold Glove:  Lagares  Team Savior:  Familia;  seriously, without him our bullpen would be a complete mess  Most Improved:  Flores; although he wasn't a gold glover at SS, he played better than most of us expected.  Offensively he has taken baby steps from last year but has probably been our most consistent hitter"
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,joeydeno,2,Wed Jul 15 00:19:57 2015 UTC,comeback player of the year- undecided  RoY- Noah  MVP- undecided  gold glove- Juan Lagares only because he has saved our ass in the outfield so many fucking times.  silver slugger- the entire pitching staff   cy young- deGrom
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,three_dee,3,Tue Jul 14 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"comeback player of the year- undecided   Probably Harvey, but a good contender is Granderson IMO.  He was OK last year, but he's on pace for close to a 4-win season this year."
NewYorkMets,3db8f1,bmd4567,3,Tue Jul 14 23:39:43 2015 UTC,I would give Gold Glove to Duda
NewYorkMets,3d9inu,IamNeo123,5,Tue Jul 14 15:38:10 2015 UTC,That's Gary Carter catching in the video...he was on the Expos at the time. Came to the Mets via trade following year. The rest is history. Flamingo.
