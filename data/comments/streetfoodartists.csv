streetfoodartists,3dv0nu,Lazy_Scheherazade,10,Sun Jul 19 19:55:00 2015 UTC,Not only that.  The lack of equipment.  It may look easy for us since we're use to having food processors and etc.  But it's all manual for them.   I just thought we should get some African representation in the sub.

streetfoodartists,3duaoo,Jesus390,13,Sun Jul 19 16:20:30 2015 UTC,You look like diarrhea slop
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,6chan,7,Sun Jul 19 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"I knew someone would say this. It is a stew type dish that you eat with bread so it's going to look a little funky. But it tastes amazing. Also why are you in a sub with street eats if you immediately call a food ""diarrhea slop""?"
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,itsadooozy,3,Sun Jul 19 16:42:08 2015 UTC,So what does it taste like brah? I didnt catch everything that went in
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,HryPerr0,5,Sun Jul 19 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"The taste will vary from maker to maker depending on the ratios of spices (and everything else) they use but /u/itsadooozy has the gist of it. Which is part of the reason I like Indian food - you can get the same dish from multiple people and all of them will taste a little different, depending on the cook's preferences. I feel like French or Italian cooking, by comparison, is very systematic."
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,icedoverfire,3,Sun Jul 19 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"Mostly it tastes like garlic and tomatoes and red chilli. But it also has onions, green pepper, potato, and peas."
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,itsadooozy,3,Sun Jul 19 17:10:26 2015 UTC,Cool. I would need more buttered bread than that tho. Mostly cause im a fatty :D
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,HryPerr0,3,Sun Jul 19 17:54:20 2015 UTC,It is a stew type dish that you eat with bread   you just described almost all Indian food
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,sauteslut,3,Sun Jul 19 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"Lol true, but this is eaten with actual leavened bread, not naan or roti or anything."
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,itsadooozy,-12,Sun Jul 19 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Because not all of it looks like diarrhea slop, but I shouldve known the second I saw indian in the title. I bet if you ate that you wouldnt be able to stop shitting for 2 days straight"
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,Jesus390,6,Sun Jul 19 17:13:59 2015 UTC,You must have a weak stomach. The dish is mostly vegetables.
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,itsadooozy,-12,Sun Jul 19 18:37:38 2015 UTC,Everyone who doesnt eat indian food has a weak stomach in comparison. You either die in the street of dysentery or get a stomach strong enough to deal with all the spices and acidity which helps slows the growth of bacteria. Thats why all those terrible overpowering spices are so popular over there.
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,Jesus390,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:08 2015 UTC,Have you ever even been to India? I really don't think you know enough about the various cuisines of a country of over a billion people to make sweeping generalizations about anything.

streetfoodartists,3duaoo,One-Two-Woop-Woop,-5,Sun Jul 19 22:31:41 2015 UTC,I wouldnt call that slop food. And nothing i said is inaccurate
streetfoodartists,3duaoo,Jesus390,0,Sun Jul 19 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"It has the consistency of mashed potatoes, mostly because it IS mashed potatoes along with other goodies.

Please pardon the bad formatting   @1:34, I believe that's melted butter poured over the top @2:15, the white stuff is indeed fresh cream from the brand Amul @2:23, the white stuff is cheese @2:43, the white stuff is Paneer, a kind of Indian Cottage Cheese @3:21, the green liquid is coriander chutney, the brown liquid is another chutney which could be tomato based, chilli based or lentil based varying from place to place @4:11, the yellow boxes are salted butter from the brand Amul @4:18, the brown stuff in the jug might be pickle, but it's hard to say for sure.

Some species (particularly Cymbopogon citratus), are commonly cultivated as culinary and medicinal herbs because of their scent, resembling that of lemons (Citrus limon).

They are found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and the largest species, the Atlantic pomfret, Brama brama, grows up to 1 m (3.3 ft) long.  Several species are important food sources for humans, especially Brama brama in the South Asia. The earlier form of the pomfret's name was pamflet, a word which probably ultimately comes from Portuguese pampo, referring to various fish such as the blue butterfish (Stromateus fiatola).

streetfoodartists,39b9an,Itroll4love,2,Thu Jun 11 07:34:12 2015 UTC,They sure did fry those chips for a very long time.  Arent you supposed to blanch them first? Or am I thinking fries?
streetfoodartists,39b9an,Colorfag,8,Thu Jun 11 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"If you want something to be crispy golden brown, you fry twice. Fries, chips, chicken, whatever.   The first fry should be at a low temperature for the purpose of driving off moisture and cooking all the way through. The second fry should be done at a high temperature for the purpose of crisping the outside and getting that golden brown.   That bunch of chips should have been two batches. The cold food to oil ratio crashes the oil temp and leads to a soggy product."
streetfoodartists,39b9an,OlBren,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:25:20 2015 UTC,You're thinking fries.
streetfoodartists,39b9an,Silverbug,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:26:01 2015 UTC,Nice way to exfoliate the hands...
streetfoodartists,39b9an,kzd15,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:21:43 2015 UTC,I'm curious how these would taste.  Usually you soak the shaved potato slices in ice water for a few hours before frying to solidify the starches more and give it the proper potato chip texture.
streetfoodartists,39b9an,Silverbug,0,Fri Jun 12 04:27:00 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the problem be that the chips won't be seasoned? Or is it enough to season them after they've been fried?
streetfoodartists,39b9an,Shiroi_Kage,7,Wed Jun 10 20:10:51 2015 UTC,You're going to want to season them after the frying phase so that when you dust them with whatever it sticks to the oily surface of the potato.
streetfoodartists,39b9an,fenrisulvur,7,Wed Jun 10 21:04:25 2015 UTC,"You can't season them before. That's just like getting your hands dirty, washing them and expecting your hands to be dirty after you wash them."
streetfoodartists,39b9an,iDev247,6,Thu Jun 11 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"They season them right after they get fried, while theyre still hot and wet from the oil.  If they seasoned them before frying, the oil would rinse away all the seasoning."

streetfoodartists,394010,poliwop,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:33:52 2015 UTC,Interesting. That sounds like quite the polarizing flavors to be combining. How would that taste? I can't imagine adding some sort of hot spice to a sweet fruit like mangos.
streetfoodartists,394010,PM_ME_YOUR_TITHS,12,Tue Jun 9 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"Here in Mexico they love Chile powder on their fruit. I had never tried it until living down here. I like it, though I don't always go for it. There's a Mexican Chile powder specifically made for this called Piquin if you ever find it and wanna give it a shot.  Also dried cranberries w/ spicy seasoning (arándanos enchilados) are great."
streetfoodartists,394010,poliwop,3,Tue Jun 9 07:47:54 2015 UTC,"As an American working on a construction crew in Mexico, we got approached a lot by kids selling candy. And because we wanted to help out the kids (and because we all love candy) we bought from them. So when I saw that my watermelon sucker was coated in some form of dust, I assumed it was some kind of fun sugar powder, like a Mexican Fun Dip kind of thing. And of course, as I'm sure you've already surmised, it was chili powder.  I'm not saying that revelation ruined my day, but it definitely ruined my moment.  So yes. Mexicans love their chili powder. On everything."

streetfoodartists,394iqh,unfuckthis,6,Fri Jun 12 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'd guess it's the same concept when you make ice cream at home using a ziplock bag, ice, salt, milk, and flavor (of vanilla extract). You put the milk and the flavor in a small ziplock bag, put the ice and salt in a bigger ziplock back, put the smaller one inside the bigger one (close both obviously), and shake it for a few minutes. Chills the milk and makes ice cream."
streetfoodartists,394iqh,ACaulfield910,2,Fri Jun 12 05:52:32 2015 UTC,I believe the area he places the liquid ice cream is being chilled using I'm guessing salt and ice? Once the liquid hits the surface it gets chilled quickly and he moves it around mixing it to get the liquid mixed in with the solid bits. The chopping of it I believe is to make it that creamy whipped texture ice cream has.
streetfoodartists,394iqh,Cock-a-la-mode,5,Fri Jun 12 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"Its called an Anti Griddle  From Wikipedia: The anti-griddle maintains a constant temperature of -30°F (c. -34.4°C) by pumping a refrigerant through a compressor to remove heat from its steel surface. Liquids, oil, and gels generally freeze in 30 to 90 seconds.

The number of naturally occurring spirals going left and going right, however, tends to follow the Fibonacci sequence.  More specifically, suppose the number of spirals in one direction is the nth Fibonacci number (usually around 5-8), then number of spirals going in the opposite direction usually follows the (n+1)th Fibonacci number (or (n-1)th if the direction you chose had the larger number of spirals).

Thousands of people claim to have the condition,  but it is not recognized in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or other scientific literature.   The term was coined in 2005, from the Greek τρύπα (trýpa) ""hole"" and φόβος (phóbos) ""fear"".   British academics Arnold Wilkins and Geoff Cole, who claim to be the first to scientifically investigate trypophobia, believe the reaction to be based on a biological revulsion, rather than a learned cultural fear.  In a research article they wrote for Psychological Science, Wilkins and Cole write that the reaction is based on a brain response that associates the shapes with danger. The type of shapes that elicit a reaction were stated to include clustered holes in skin, meat, wood, soil, plants, wounds and bubbles, and that upon seeing these shapes, some people said they felt their skin was crawling, shudder, feel itchy, experience panic attacks, sweat, palpitate and feel nauseous. Some said the holes seemed ""disgusting and gross"" or that ""something might be living inside those holes"".    Using data and information from Trypophobia.com, Wilkins and Cole analyzed example images and believe that the images had ""unique characteristics"".  Wilkins and Cole state that the reaction behind the phobia was an ""unconscious reflex reaction"" based on a ""primitive portion of the brain that associates the image with something dangerous"".   In another research article, Le, Cole and Wilkins developed a symptom questionnaire which they state can be used to identify trypophobia.

streetfoodartists,2xanib,CookingWithScorpion,3,Fri Feb 27 06:32:05 2015 UTC,What is this dish called ?
streetfoodartists,2xanib,GamerX44,3,Tue Mar 17 02:14:20 2015 UTC,Its probably just an Indian take on Chinese Chow Mein -- or a form of Noodle Manchurian  Fusion Indo-Chinese is huge in India
streetfoodartists,2xanib,wolfmanpraxis,3,Fri May 29 21:48:57 2015 UTC,I think this is hakka noodles. Hakka noodles is amazing.

streetfoodartists,2rwhr1,narachak,23,Mon Jun 15 21:02:51 2015 UTC,How many eggs can that guy in the foreground put away?  He was downing them like clockwork.
streetfoodartists,2rwhr1,PanioloTown,4,Fri Jan 9 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"seriously, fucker is just mowing down on those. deviled eggs maybe?"
streetfoodartists,2rwhr1,pursenboots,8,Sat Jan 10 00:45:44 2015 UTC,I don't know how it's even possible to ever have enough deviled eggs.  I'm not surprised by his behavior.

streetfoodartists,2qiihr,CheeseforSheogorath,4,Sat Dec 27 06:44:47 2014 UTC,Can someone tell me how this works? Is it like a reverse ice cream maker where the ice/salt is in the tube?
streetfoodartists,2qiihr,silverwyrm,3,Sat Dec 27 06:45:33 2014 UTC,My assumption is that the tube is chilled. The salt basically acts to get ice colder than it would be otherwise. No salt necessary with this method.
streetfoodartists,2qiihr,Hing-LordofGurrins,1 point,Mon May 18 22:38:04 2015 UTC,I'm totally going to make one of these. Just a rotating drum of ice and salt.

streetfoodartists,2qe2vm,j-rocc,4,Sat May 30 17:45:10 2015 UTC,I'd probably just look at it until it starting melting in the heat.

streetfoodartists,2qdopt,Thewonderingent1065,2,Fri Dec 26 03:12:13 2014 UTC,Regular paint! Sugar paint would be great if I wanted ants.

streetfoodartists,2qdv0y,e-wrecked,1 point,Thu Dec 25 22:41:31 2014 UTC,depends on how much the stomach can handle i guess. the chef is skilled. could have used spoons instead of plain hands.
