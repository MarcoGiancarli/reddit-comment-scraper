FractalPorn,3djrzk,huntedpadfoot,5,Fri Jul 17 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"Photoshop with a great many of pictues that have been taken from high positions. Then I put them on top of each other and align them. I try to find patterns that I like and single them out and repeat/copy them - but always so that you can still see what is underneath. I call it a game of association.  These layered photoshop files can become 3Gb and up - I am using a hackintosh with 16Gb ram and two ssd (one is solely a swap disk) otherwise you have waiting times that become so long that you can no longer do anything as soon as it becomes too big.  Certain areas I do not like are masked (sometimes it is hard work to find on what layer they are) or I put something else on top. Color is added in several ways - for instance with gradient masks or creating masked color layers where I use highlights, midtones or shadows as masks.  I make multiple variants and then also start combining them the same way. On my site the one with the tunnel was the first one that was ready (link elsewhere in this post - am on mobile) and then there is one that starts to become noisy, pixelated with saturated colors. That is where I stop. The one I posted here is somewhere in between.  I worked on them in the course of several months - working on it for several hours from time to time, then putting them away again."

I make all kinds of saves in between, but I am  not sure if it makes sense to most people since a lot of saves are done for technical reasons (just before I flatten part of the work or throw certain things out) - and the ones I have shown on my site (link elsewhere in the comments) are in between saves that I found exciting.   The process is also not straightforward enough for a movie/sets of screenshot - and I am not sure if that would crash my machine...."

FractalPorn,3bq9uc,hi_my_name_is_idgaf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's really simple: In the conventional mandelbrot set, the color of a pixel tells you how long its orbit is, i.e. every orbit's escape time is drawn at its 0th point. Instead, I draw the color at iteration n, in this case n = 8. This means there are actually a number of different patterns this same procedure can produce, just by varying n. I've tried all of them up to 50, and this is the prettiest IMO. Beyond about 20, the orbits diverge too much and the noise (the faint blue glow in this image) washes out the structures.  Edit: I haven't gotten around to fixing up my code, so here's my sloppy reference implementation: http://wickerso.ft.lc/projects/javastuff/buddhabrot/src/buddhabrot/BrainiBrot.java"

FractalPorn,398chv,darth_vapor_,10,Wed Jun 10 01:52:17 2015 UTC,"Well it's a bit complicated. The first image on the top left is just his regular photo in 1-bit color.  The bottom left image is what I got after I fed the first one into my boundary-scanning recursive subdivision algorithm, which is based on the Mariani-Silver algorithm.  It scans the boundary of a virtual square and subdivides it into ever smaller squares until it can draw a square of solid color in the region being scanned without intersecting the black-white boundary in the photo.   I took that image and fed it into another program which created a simple infinite tiling along both axes to infinity, and then does an inverted Cartesian plane transform.  Basically it inverts each pixel through a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. That produced the top right image.  The bottom right image takes the output from the Mariani-Silver program and does a polar-to-rectangular transform (necessary to correct for distortion) and then maps it onto the iteration boundaries of an escape-time fractal, such as the Mandelbrot or Julia set.   A custom 4x4 anti-aliasing algorithm was applied to both images on the right.   I wrote all the code from scratch."

The sinusoidal transform tends to produce squares and blocks, but the diamond transform obviously produces a diamond shape.  In balance, this leads to a skewing over distance.

One advantage of it is I have full control over the palette shift as a function of axis or iterator. I've never really paid any attention to mandelbrot and I have to say, zooming in on parts of the function and seeing it infinity create structures is pretty awesome. Plus the structures themselves are amazing...  (Yes I'm a noob to this stuff...) So a little late, but Happy Easter. This was done using that script, and adding a reflection in the x/y axis, then some slight modification with Gimp (yes, I cheated a little)."

FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,4,Sat Apr 4 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"Upvoted out of principle, but isn't the definition of a fractal simply ""similar patterns recurring at progressively smaller scales""?"
FractalPorn,31eaqv,coltonapo,3,Sat Apr 4 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Googled 'fractal': ""A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop."" What makes a fractal are the ""self-similar"" and ""feedback loop"" qualities. So, if i could zoom in/out of this picture to different scales and still see Hitler made out of swastikas, then it'd be a fractal. As far as I can tell, that seems untrue."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,2,Sat Apr 4 20:08:30 2015 UTC,"The Mandelbrot set doesn't have exact copies of itself, so the ""self-similarity"" definition of fractals are a bit subjective.  A better definition is that fractals are figures with Hausdorff dimension greater than its topological dimension."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,protestor,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:13:52 2015 UTC,You'll need to explain that to me like I've passed Calculus.
FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:18:08 2015 UTC,Oh I see what you're saying now! You're right. For sure. :)
FractalPorn,31eaqv,coltonapo,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"I reckon the answer to this lies with the concept of self-similarity. It might mean exact similarity as in the case of the Menger Sponge, or it might just mean roughly similar, as in the case of the Mandelbrot where there are regions of exact similarity, and areas where you find variations of similar motifs at different scales. The algorithmic aspect is interesting though because coastlines and leaf patterns and tonnes of stuff in nature are accurately described as fractals too. It's hard (but not impossible) to argue that these things are 'algorithmic' in the sense of having an underlying equation, but I think I'm right in saying that one of Mandelbrot's insights was to find a mathematical way of describing some of these objects in terms of non-integer dimensional spaces, 1.2 dimensions for instance is somewhere between a point and a line, which kind of does my head in. So maybe one way of thinking about fractals is as self-similar objects which can be described mathematically..."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,JacobBettany,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:11:42 2015 UTC,"You can zoom into any swastika forever and see smaller swastikas inside ad infinitum.  That's why I put a large swastika next to Hitler so you can see what it's made of.  Recursively smaller ones, at ever smaller scales."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,2,Sat Apr 4 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the perfect analogy: put together a bunch of Menger sponges in the shape of [Karl Menger.](Karl Menger) I'm sure there are fractals in the picture, but it's just multiple of same fractal positioned in a way that forms an entirely different image. None of the fractals are positioned in a fractal pattern, which is most obvious in the largest swastika. There's no symmetry to it, if it was completely radially symmetric then I'd see it as the hypnotic symbol Hitler thought it'd be."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,2,Sat Apr 4 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"Hold on a second, who said fractals require symmetry?  They don't.  A shape need not be symmetrical in any way to qualify as a fractal.  As long as you can zoom into it indefinitely and find smaller copies of the whole within (however haphazardly or randomly they may be arranged), it qualifies as a fractal.  That means the swastika is a fractal.  Classics like Mandelbrot, Julia, Sierpinski, Koch curve, etc. do have plenty of symmetry, but this fractal and this fractal both have no symmetry at all, and they are definitely fractals.  I know because they're based on Mandelbrot's formula and I've explored them extensively.  You can zoom in forever and find new swirls and fluid shapes constantly."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,xbuzzbyx,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"You are correct in saying fractals need no symmetry. I threw on the last sentence haphazardly, it's only what I would have liked to see. All I'm saying is there's no equation used for the position of the swastikas. It looks like it was computer generated with repeated fill commands, not based on any fractal pattern. I would love to know how it was made."
FractalPorn,31eaqv,coltonapo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, okay... I'll admit it:  you're right.  Hitler and swastikas have no equation, they're just filled with shapes.  But this shape filling is recursive and goes on at ever smaller scales.  When it comes to art, people generally don't care whether you used pure math or some trick to make it.  As long as it looks interesting, you can cheat all you want.  So while not technically a true fractal, you gotta admit it does look pretty fractally.   Just like this swastika here.  I made it the same way only this time...  look, symmetry!"

FractalPorn,2zoi52,Lalorama,2,Fri Mar 20 12:54:47 2015 UTC,"I scanned a picture of a $100 bill and then fed that image into a program I wrote that tiles any bitmap around a Mandelbrot or Julia set.  The program works by taking the final value of Z from Mandelbrot's formula Z(n+1)=Z(n)2 +c and doing a polar-to-rectangular transform on that coordinate, then mapping it to a photograph of the $100 bill.  In this particular case, the fractal is a Julia set at +0.472, +0i) rotated 90 degrees.  The tree itself was drawn starting from iteration 3 onward, and only the tree trunk was drawn for iteration 2 (that's why it sticks out and creates the trunk).  Any points that escaped to infinity prior to iteration 2 were ignored."

FractalPorn,2zaeki,bryceguy72,6,Mon Mar 16 23:11:10 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this be more of a circle packing problem?
FractalPorn,2zaeki,osmac,2,Tue Mar 17 03:00:37 2015 UTC,"Well, yes.  But the fact that a lemon has a circular cross section is incidental.  If it were square, this would be a square packing problem.  If it were boot-shaped, this would be a boot-packing problem.  If it were fudge-shaped..."
FractalPorn,2zaeki,lycium,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and fudge packing has about as much to do with fractal-ness as circle packing. Without recursion, repetition at many scales, it's not fractal."
FractalPorn,2zaeki,spfccsmftftt,2,Wed Mar 18 15:17:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing.  Most people seem to think that anything that is fragmented is a fractal.
FractalPorn,2zaeki,protestor,3,Tue Mar 17 05:04:38 2015 UTC,"If you can zoom indefinitely and still get more detail (that is, more lemons), then it's correct to call it a fractal. And because of the way circles packs, there's always room between the cracks for more circles."
FractalPorn,2zaeki,spfccsmftftt,2,Tue Mar 17 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, and if it was generated by a computer then most likely they used a Apollonian circle packing algorithm, which is a fractal, but as I look at this image I can not tell if this was what was used, frankly it looks like it was done by hand, I know some graphic artists that could do this up in a few hours if they had the push to do so, without using fractal math (using complex numbers).  I would be interested in learning how they did if it is."
FractalPorn,2zaeki,lycium,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"There's nothing necessarily fractal about circle packing, and most geometric procedures can be made to produce fractals just by iterating the process.  Here's how you could write a very simple program to make this image: generate a black&white version of your target image (thresholding the brightness), then do like 1m random trial circles: generate a random (x, y) centre and radius, and see if it fits. Keep track of the biggest (largest radius) fitting candidate, and after the trials use add this circle to the set, and clear all the white pixels underneath it in the b&w image. No recursion, no iteration, no complex numbers, no fractals."
FractalPorn,2zaeki,lycium,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"That is one way to do it.  However, I don't know about using random trial circles because such random stabs in the dark are liable to miss something.  There is a systematic way to find the biggest circle that will fit inside a given shape.  In fact, it doesn't have to be a circle, it can be any shape. The problem becomes similar to circle packing but instead of packing circles, you recursively pack various shapes of decreasing size into one large arbitrarily-defined area.  Here are a bunch of flowers this algorithm packed into an AK-47, made on the day of Khalashnikov's death:  http://bryceguy72.deviantart.com/art/Rest-In-Peace-Kalashnikov-429840533"
FractalPorn,2zaeki,spfccsmftftt,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"There are definitely other ways to do it, I just chose the simplest way I could describe (simple Monte Carlo search); it can be extended to non-circular shapes if you also choose a random rotation angle for the shape.  With some optimisations / improvements (e.g. don't use random radius, keep expanding until it won't fit) it wouldn't even suck so much :)"
FractalPorn,2zaeki,spfccsmftftt,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:15:16 2015 UTC,"I did not do it by hand... that would take way too long.  I wrote an algorithm that recursively subdivides an arbitrary shape into small copies of some other shape, in this case, lemon slices.

FractalPorn,2zaeki,suprsolutions,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"Self- similarity is a property of fractals, you are very correct.

But I may be being to philosophical ;) LOL"

I have always felt like this is how the universe works; you can zoom out and things become infinitely larger or you can zoom in and things become infinitely smaller. Humans can only perceive to a certain point because of limits in our vision and I think we can't fathom the limitless framework of information that exists.    If you think about it, a fractal is the perfect way to store information.. its an ideal system for organizing things in a hierarchical order.  If this is true, the real question is who created the fractal and does he/she/it have the power to be able to pick certain spots in the fractal and extract information?  Think about it.. Crazy."

Its not really an idea easily communicated in short format anyhoo."

FractalPorn,2rj75z,Starguard,1 point,Sat Jan 10 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I pretty much use Mandelbulber exclusively, without any post processing in other Apps. This particular style developed out of taking 2d cross sections of 3d objects, and applying custom colours. I'm not a graphic designer, so I don't have a lot of the 3d skills a lot of the fractal artists have, which means my images don't tend to be quite so polished as others."

The short version:  When you calculate a point in the Mandelbrot set, you ""touch"" many other points determining if a point is inside or outside the set.  For each point that's outside the set, make each point you ""touch"" a little brighter.  Rinse and repeat and you end up with the buddhabrot.  This is a good summary of it all, with plenty of links to more information."

FractalPorn,2nvaqc,JacobBettany,1 point,Sun Nov 30 20:03:34 2014 UTC,Was this done in Mandelbulb by any chance?
FractalPorn,2nvaqc,Daeurth,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:36:34 2014 UTC,It was!
FractalPorn,2nvaqc,iofthebeholder,1 point,Mon Dec 1 07:48:02 2014 UTC,"really gorgeous goldleaf klimt kind of vibe, nice work!  just started messing around with mandelbulb 3D, can you offer any insight into how you get that 2D texture layer on flat surfaces kind of effect?"
FractalPorn,2nvaqc,iofthebeholder,1 point,Sun Dec 7 08:59:38 2014 UTC,"Hi there. This was actually created with Mandelbulber as opposed to Mandelbulb3d, and oddly, I didn't add the texture layer, it's part of the original hybrid fractal. Mandelbulber has a 'detail' setting and I've discovered that you can get this effect if you vastly reduce the detail level... which is slightly counter-intuitive. At a regular detail level, though, what you would end up with here is just a series of disconnected strings in a 3d space. Reducing the detail, makes those strings merge, and the 2d effect is basically an artifact of the process."

I had a special party at my house this last weekend and put this on my big screen while listening to the dirtiest dubstep I could find and the way this image moved was just unreal. the center acted like a small visual boombox and it just wrapped and warpped with the music. This pic made my trip. Fuck it, this sub made my trip."

(I've got various stuff in that vicinity on my site (fleen.org) for earlier versions.)  A giant projector is also good.  Have you seen this? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL0lNGXoP8E
