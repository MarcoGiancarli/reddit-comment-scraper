spiderbro,3dxn4z,rogue_chicken,22,Mon Jul 20 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"They're only deadly to very small kids, small animals, the elderly and people with very compromised immunity. A healthy adult can survive a black widow bite no problem. Beautiful specimen!"
spiderbro,3dxn4z,P-01S,11,Mon Jul 20 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and yellow jackets won't kill me either... still don't want their venom inside me."
spiderbro,3dxn4z,Heratiki,19,Mon Jul 20 20:14:02 2015 UTC,The Black Widow is a beautiful creature and is rarely deadly for even weak people. But good god damn does it not hurt and some people can feel muscle pain for weeks afterwards. Some without antivenom can swell to the point of damage to the skin but that's about it. But good grief the pain. Such bad bad pain.
spiderbro,3dxn4z,murd3rsaurus,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:24 2015 UTC,personal experience?
spiderbro,3dxn4z,Heratiki,13,Tue Jul 21 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"I watched the strongest person I know, who turned the tip of his fingers into flowers with a router (power tool) while making a sign, reduced to a sniveling child after a bite. It wasn't pretty to watch."
spiderbro,3dxn4z,murd3rsaurus,6,Tue Jul 21 00:22:40 2015 UTC,You paint pretty pictures
spiderbro,3dxn4z,Heratiki,6,Tue Jul 21 00:40:49 2015 UTC,The best part is how he handled the flowered fingers. He wiped the blood off the sign. Stuck paper towels around each finger and duct taped them back together. Finished the sign and just had to stain it a bit darker so you couldn't see where the blood stains were.   My step father is an amazing man. But a Black Widow bite to his inner thigh and he broke after a couple hours. It was hurtful to watch for sure. Knowing the pain was so intense that splaying the skin around your fingers couldn't even compare. I felt so bad. Never lost respect for him and still scared shitless he could probably still destroy me. And I'm 37 with my own grown kids.
spiderbro,3dxn4z,ifnull,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:36 2015 UTC,I had minor necrosis from an untreated bite.
spiderbro,3dxn4z,Heratiki,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:57 2015 UTC,Necrosis is probably the worst possible thing outside of death you could get. What exactly causes necrosis from the bite does anyone know?
spiderbro,3dxn4z,usedtoilet,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this but I watched some clip on YouTube and it mentioned that the cause of necrosis in cases of bites is usually because of special proteins from the toxin.  The protein causes structural damage to a cell, causing it to break/die prematurely."
spiderbro,3dxn4z,Heratiki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:10 2015 UTC,I've heard something similar but doing cursory research on Widow bites doesn't show any necrosis as an effect of the bite. Not that it can't happen I'm  just curious how it happens!

spiderbro,3dujqj,Debinatrix,2,Sun Jul 19 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely a brown widow. The good news is--he's kind of harmless. I used to live in a house full of them, and I didn't notice for the longest time because they hid as soon as they saw a shadow (they built their webs close to the carpet, and our carpet lining was poorly attached to the wall and big enough for them to hide in). They lived off of the roaches. This was in San Antonio, and not my house. Bad news is, pesticide doesn't work on them, so you'll have to get rid of him manually if you don't think he's bro enough."
spiderbro,3dujqj,arydactl,2,Mon Jul 20 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"looks like a brown widow, but I cant see the hourglass.  their bites aren't as harmful as their black cousins, but I would still recommend caution when handling them.  it could also be a false widow perhaps, though I've not seen one that brown."
spiderbro,3dujqj,fayettevillainjd,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"Are you in SoCal or somewhere in that general vicinity? If so, this looks to be the Latrodectus Geometricus, or the Brown Widow, one of the only not-bro spiders I've come across. You may have noticed a lack of Black Widows in your area; this is soley because Brown Widows are not bros. Basically, they came from Africa and are astonishingly quickly driving the Black Widows out of their home. Anyhow, sorry for the rant, I just have a personal vendetta against these invasive bastards who are killing all the REAL bros. I suggest, however unpleasing it may sound, that you eliminate this feller. I am truly sorry to be the one to bring you this news."
spiderbro,3dwq9t,RolainTheVariable,4,Mon Jul 20 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you've already done the research and know they won't hurt you, the best thing to do is to go handle bugs and spiders. Head to the local park, find a small, innocuous bug and start there, like a lady bug or caterpillar, watch them for a bit then pick one up. Rolie Polies work too. Then find small house spiders and just watch them. Literally just watch them move, think, problem solve, it's entrancing. Once you've got enough watching under your belt, just nudge one onto your arm or hand and let it explore. You'll grow more comfortable the more you know about them and more you play with them."

spiderbro,3dwq9t,Mad_Hatter93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"House spiders, the ones you can find in any corner of a house, don't really bite. I've handled plenty of them and never been bitten. You just kinda stick your hand in their walking path and they climb right on. Jumping spiders don't bite either, and they're the cutest most inquisitive little arachnids ever :-)"
spiderbro,3dwq9t,8leggedyogi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"The initial comment is correct, they generally simply won't try. And honestly most of the spiders you would interact with are simply too small or to weak even if they wanted to."

A bro if ever there was one.  Jumpers are easy to spot. Most have two large eyes in front and two small eyes to the side, striped legs, and a distinct posture. Their good eyesight means they can recognize faces, and they will look at cameras and make eye contact if they see you watching them. Love the little buggers."

What annoys me most are the people who feel the need to spray them with aerosol products or try to light them on fire. Or just kill them just to do it.

When they want to breed, they make a web, crawl under it and then blow a years worth of jizz all over it.   After this they punch it to get their pedipalps, the small arms on the front all jizzy. (The fists if you prefer) . Once they find a female they lift up her front legs and punch the sperm into her body (into the oviduct).  You can tell if it's a male in some species by looking for hooks on the first two legs about half way up the leg, or by checking to see if the pedipalps look like ""boxing gloves"" because on males they're larger and rounder at the tips than females. Based on your first picture I think you can see one of the hooks on it's legs, so it is a male."

spiderbro,3d67ds,STiNkYh,16,Mon Jul 13 21:01:27 2015 UTC,Read the book because of the game. Was not disappointed.
spiderbro,3d67ds,Justmindless,4,Mon Jul 13 23:34:08 2015 UTC,Was it better than the game in your opinion? I kinda want to pick it up.
spiderbro,3d67ds,Jubawub,5,Tue Jul 14 00:30:40 2015 UTC,It was just different. A lot of the info from the book is in the game anyway. I would try the audiobook. it was very immersive.
spiderbro,3d67ds,Justmindless,2,Tue Jul 14 00:44:08 2015 UTC,Thanks :D
spiderbro,3d67ds,Jubawub,2,Tue Jul 14 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"I have only read about a hundred pages in, and I have to agree that it is very different from the game, but it's different in a so much better way.  You have more complexity in the characters, and since there is actually dialouge from the main character, you get more immersed in what's going on.  If you can, pick it up and read it, it's well worth it!"
spiderbro,3d67ds,Jubawub,2,Tue Jul 14 08:23:55 2015 UTC,"I'll try to find it, thanks! :)"
spiderbro,3d67ds,Dopebear,3,Tue Jul 14 17:03:27 2015 UTC,Except it's very typical on Russian literature where there's a lot of dialogue. A lot of dialogue. That put me off of the novel a little but picked it up and read it after finishing the game a few times and still enjoyed it.
spiderbro,3d67ds,whoreticulturalist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I LOVE that amount of dialouge. Roadside Picnic and the movie STALKER are pretty much built on dialouge, and that's one of the reasons why I love it so much! :)"

spiderbro,3d67ds,lilroy4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"It is really good. I am a sucker for post-apocalyptic things, and it's hard to put the book down.  It has the same storyline as the game, but it has so much more complexity, immersion and so much more to offer.  So I would say I recommend it!"

Luckily though I got plenty of true spiders so if they come into my room then it's easy food for my spiders.
spiderbro,3cknjp,Nitrozah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:04:18 2015 UTC,Looks like a Lace Webbed Spider (Amaurobius sp.) if you're curious.

I have watched it make it's web. There's no pattern to the web, looks like wherever it can contect two spots with its web it does. It's captured so many things in it's web (Roaches, Bees, Flies) My question is, do I leave it or is it a spider that I should get rid of?   Edit: it's looking up towards the camera. So the legs are in front and the butt in back. I honestly wish I had a good camera!"

spiderbro,3cmew3,philoponeria,2,Thu Jul 9 13:23:39 2015 UTC,I would only move it to a new location if you have a pet or child who may get bitten. Otherwise leave her be and you have a cool story.

spiderbro,3chpij,xkcdfanboy,6,Wed Jul 8 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"Orb-weaver toxicity is extremely low and poses virtually no risk to humans unless the person happens to be allergic (like a bee sting.) The abdomen size has no correlation to venom toxicity. Look at the brown recluse, easily the most dangerous spider bite (in North America at least) and it has a relatively small abdomen. I think the large abdomen just gives the spider a more menacing appearance."
spiderbro,3chpij,Toa_Ignika,3,Wed Jul 8 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"The venom is actually inside a tiny sac, the size of the adomen has little to do with the power of the bite.

spiderbro,3bw05k,Amazonpage,6,Thu Jul 2 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"Shameless plug!  Okay, they're not fat, but my wife makes some great stuffed spiders!"
spiderbro,3bw05k,BC_Hawke,6,Fri Jul 3 07:52:20 2015 UTC,Those are FUCKING ADORABLE.  I MUST HAVE ONE
spiderbro,3bw05k,Trollioo,2,Fri Jul 3 10:39:24 2015 UTC,"I have seen these before and they're awesome. I really want one, but they're a little out of my price range ATM. I might have to bite the bullet and save for one."
spiderbro,3bw05k,Amazonpage,10,Fri Jul 3 16:32:02 2015 UTC,I feel like they messed up the pedipalps a bit. They need to use a different fuzzy fabric for that portion and then use a bit of the same fabric on the face. It would make it look more cute.
spiderbro,3bw05k,SweetLenore,2,Thu Jul 2 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"As the concept artist, I agree completely on the palps. The moustache might have been left off for simplification so I can understand that, but... fuzzy palps please :<"
spiderbro,3bw05k,Wollo,9,Mon Jul 13 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"The plush has been sitting in 'in progress' status since 2014, I figure a bit of support via their email notice system might push them to get the ball rolling on producing this spiderbro."
spiderbro,3bw05k,DagonDoesDallas,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:31 2015 UTC,I for one would love to have a Squishable spiderbro!
spiderbro,3bw05k,Jaberkaty,2,Fri Jul 3 07:52:15 2015 UTC,Maybe a crosspost to /r/spiders and /r/awwnverts?
spiderbro,3bw05k,squishable,2,Fri Jul 3 10:55:01 2015 UTC,"Just noticed this!  SO, the spider design looks good but were having some trouble with the back - getting that exact type of tie-dyed fur has become a lot more difficult and we're trying to decide if it would be better with just purple.  I promise we're working on it though...:)"
spiderbro,3bw05k,Wollo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"Oohhh, I thought it might be a cost thing since the prism animals seem pricier than the regular ones, not a supply issue... is that the reason prism owl is out of stock too? How could tiedye ever be allowed to run out, what an injustice D: Rainbow butt spots are glorious though, please rainbow butt spots if at all possible! Even if they have to be pastel rainbow, or another of the prism colors (blue-purple is a really good one too!)  And, I agree the palps should still be fuzzy like in my concept, even if he doesn't get his moustache :P"
spiderbro,3bw05k,Wollo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"Woah, I'm always super glad that people like my design so much :D I was pretty overwhelmed with the support I got on that round of OpenSquish and I've been refreshing the in-progress page for a year, still hype to see him go into production <3"
spiderbro,3bw6my,my_futureperfect,8,Thu Jul 2 17:28:44 2015 UTC,Attack your coworker. Revenge!
spiderbro,3bw6my,InfernoTurnip,6,Thu Jul 2 18:09:19 2015 UTC,Good work looks to be in good condition still. What happened?
spiderbro,3bw6my,evlgns,4,Thu Jul 2 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"My coworker slapping at him with a stick and laughing. I took the stick and gently brushed at the really large jumping spider with my hand. I was trying to pick him up, but he was having none of that. My coworker told me that he was going to hurt me. ? . No way."
spiderbro,3bw6my,SweetLenore,3,Thu Jul 2 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"Dwah, poor little buddy. Maybe your coworker has bad aim and he didn't hit him luckily. Good job saving the bro. :-D"
spiderbro,3bwn8m,citricacidx,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:40 2015 UTC,Dunno why it pixelated so bad.  http://imgur.com/OJpWaz8
spiderbro,3bu3wd,HSDclover,14,Thu Jul 2 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"An update, after almost an hour of tirelessly webbing, the spider finally got it. Eat well my friend."
spiderbro,3bu3wd,Sleeper_in_the_code,7,Thu Jul 2 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"Spiders always freaked me out as a kid, now i could just watch one work for hours."
spiderbro,3bu3wd,dbe7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:30:21 2015 UTC,"Looks like a daddy long leg.  Interesting note here:   The web has no adhesive properties but the irregular structure traps insects, making escape difficult. The spider quickly envelops its prey with silk and then inflicts the fatal bite. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later.   It's the Jigsaw of spiders."
spiderbro,3btbyj,Naknaknaknaknaknak,9,Wed Jul 1 23:51:03 2015 UTC,"Jewel Spider (Gasteracantha cancriformis or Austracantha minax, depending on your location). I had literally hundreds of these at my old house. We had a path between our garage and house that was the perfect length and height for them.  I can't tell you how many times I ran into those guys going to school or work in the morning. And they come in a TON of colors!"
spiderbro,3btbyj,DarkRubberDucky,4,Thu Jul 2 05:23:20 2015 UTC,Where I live they are Spiny-backed Orb weavers. The name spiny backed orb weaver sounds way cooler. I let on of these guys spin a web on both of my hands when I was swimming.
spiderbro,3btbyj,AweInspiringPickle,2,Thu Jul 2 22:11:55 2015 UTC,I can't tell you how many times I ran into those guys going to school or work in the morning.   I initially read this as saying that the spiders were going to school and work in the morning.
spiderbro,3btbyj,Traejeek,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"Well, a few times I DID find them on me at work or school, so both apply!"
spiderbro,3btbyj,DarkRubberDucky,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"Clearly, these are spiders with ambition and work ethic.  Stay in the yard and subsist on whatever happens to fly into their webs?  Nope; these bros are gonna go to school and breed sustainably-farmable fruit flies, like eight-legged Norman Borlaugs."
spiderbro,3btbyj,FeroxCarnivore,2,Fri Jul 3 05:28:50 2015 UTC,They are super amazing. If you run into their webs early evening... by daylight they have a whole new web up and ready to go. I kid you not when I say there were four in the row one morning... I had web on my glasses... it was beautiful.
spiderbro,3btbyj,DarkRubberDucky,2,Fri Jul 3 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"That's badass it looks like a skulltula from Zelda, what type of spider is this. Not gonna lie though it is a little creepy."
spiderbro,3btbyj,kizzeret,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:10 2015 UTC,Spider companion is best companion.
spiderbro,3btbyj,FeroxCarnivore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:36:03 2015 UTC,Thanks so much everyone. I didn't realize this would get so many upvotes so quickly. This was actually my first post ever. (Besides from the same pic on r/pics to find the right subreddit).
spiderbro,3bul46,TheBubblewrappe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:28:31 2015 UTC,What area/region do you live in?
spiderbro,3bul46,kevlarkate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:31:52 2015 UTC,Los Angeles
spiderbro,3bul46,kevlarkate,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:13 2015 UTC,My best guess would be a plain old wolf spider http://www.spiderzrule.com/wolf7.htm
spiderbro,3bul46,kevlarkate,2,Thu Jul 2 18:36:18 2015 UTC,That was my guess also!! Just wanted confirmation. Took me a week but he finally came off the ceiling to the floor and I got him outside. I named him Harold.
spiderbro,3bul46,kevlarkate,3,Fri Jul 3 09:20:55 2015 UTC,Hahaha he just wanted to be your roommate!
spiderbro,3bt8n3,Mughi,4,Wed Jul 1 23:23:28 2015 UTC,Awh so cute :3  I love jumping spiders
spiderbro,3bt8n3,TamedShozzie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:37:16 2015 UTC,That's a great pic!  Love the jumpers.
spiderbro,3brfcv,P-dubbs,2,Wed Jul 1 15:26:58 2015 UTC,Pretty!  Her markings remind me of a glass mosaic.
spiderbro,3brfcv,great-granny-jessie,2,Wed Jul 1 17:39:52 2015 UTC,Has the look of one I recently shared. Orchard Orb weaver. The official spider of /r/spiders if I am not mistaken.  Fantastic photo.
spiderbro,3brfcv,EGSlavik,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:04:11 2015 UTC,Wow very nice. What is she hanging on to?
spiderbro,3brfcv,SweetLenore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Some string that the bean plants are climbing, like this."
spiderbro,3brfcv,Faifig,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know such a small spider could make a web so thick."
spiderbro,3brfcv,abqnm666,3,Thu Jul 2 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"If I ever met any spider that could spin silk that thick I'd crown him and bow down, because he'd be as big as a small dog."
spiderbro,3bt9uf,boom3r84,3,Wed Jul 1 23:33:26 2015 UTC,Still better protection than Norton
spiderbro,3bqu4u,GIMPKING,2,Wed Jul 1 12:17:55 2015 UTC,I saw him moving on the wall and took this picture. Then I went to chill on the couch and I saw him there as well. He is a chill dude.
