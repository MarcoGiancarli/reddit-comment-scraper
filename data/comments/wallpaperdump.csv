wallpaperdump,3e10ri,ckinz16,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:32 2015 UTC,I saw some duplicates of some blonde girl and half dome. Cool collection though where do you find the wallpaper of the album artworks?
wallpaperdump,3e10ri,Rebellious_Monkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"The album art wallpapers are from a handful of places. /r/musicwallpapers is a great source for many of them. Some of them have come from others' collections on this subreddit. The Depeche Mode wallpapers, however, came directly from an archive of the band's website itself, so I recommend at least looking for a band's site to search for any material - you never know what'll turn up! :)"

wallpaperdump,3dkj3s,secondbiggest,2,Fri Jul 17 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe it woule be a good idea to break it up into smaller pieces? Then if someone want to sort them out (into predefined categories, presumably) they can just start with one piece of the collection, comment on here that they are doing that piece, and when it's finished they can send it back to you?  Preferably the first one starts with part 1, the second person with part 2, and so on. If someone says they started on a part, but you don't get a response in 2 weeks, you can assume, it won't get done, and you can add it back to the 'todo'-list?  It would be a little bit of management on your part as well, but if you can split it in pieces of 1000 pics for example, and make it so everyone can download only one part if they want (easy to do as a torrent of multiple folders). Maybe even make a subreddit of it. It sure is a lot of work, but if it gets done, there will be a collection of 87.000+ categorized wallpapers, free to use for anyone!  And if you need help with the management itself, I'll be glad to help ;)"

It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress numbers, files, and websites. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored across the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.
