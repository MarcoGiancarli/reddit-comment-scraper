mfdoom,3dx44f,chronye,6,Mon Jul 20 06:52:18 2015 UTC,"I like venomous villain! At one point I was really in to it, I even copped the vinyl but then noticed two tracks on the B side were censored and there was added gaps between tracks so I sold it on. But the CD is a good listen. The tracks that really let it down IMO are ""rap game"" and ""pop quiz"". Rap game especially, the way that manchild flows make me cringe !  I think he did do it for the money. But there are some classic doom tracks on here I think. Ode to road rage is sick. And I love that Kool Keith has a random verse on this album. He actually did an album on the same label (insomniac) a couple of years later called Mr.Nogatco that's worth checking out. Not his best, but similar kind of production styles and value as VV2.  There was some rumours of VV3 a few years back...fingers crossed..."
mfdoom,3dx44f,liewemaxi,2,Mon Jul 20 08:46:50 2015 UTC,I'm actually a huge fan of DOOM's verse on rap game. The beat on that song is pretty bad ass as well.

IIRC, DOOM is literally on the album for something like 18 minutes.  and the rhymes he does do on there were throwaway verses and placeholders.  The rest is a collection sub-par production and crew raps by some dudes from FL or GA that paid DOOM to make an appearance and slap his name on it.  it's painfully obvious that DOOM had little to nothing to do with the input on that album."

When it comes to Count Bass D, I've loved his rhymes with Doom, but his own albums were pretty miss imo. I've only listened to Dwight Spitz and he hardly even raps in most songs. Maybe it's all about the beats, which I can dig, as they are pretty great. When he does rap, the flow is great, I love his style, but he falls into pure brag rap. I mean hell, look at Dwight Spitz (""You must know I'm much better than you""). I don't mind bragging in rap, but I mean common man, you got to have more than a couple full length songs you rap in to earn the brags.   I guess I'm writing this because I'm curious how you view Count Bass D and if his other albums are the same way."
mfdoom,3cenq1,Tatsumi,2,Tue Jul 7 19:17:01 2015 UTC,Too be fair DOOM brag raps a lot just in the third person consciously.

Hold down to turn it on and it will be solid orange in standby. Push again and it turns blue and starts the recording. Push again and it turns orange and stops the recording. Hold down to turn it off. Pretty simple device but cool nonetheless. I've already noticed that it doesn't cope with darkness well at all. Gets quite grainy in reduced light.

I've been testing out the videopen a bit today. It's gonna take a while to figure out how to use to get decent looking footage..."
mfdoom,3cd4do,Knickerbocker01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:52:44 2015 UTC,I'm guessing he made a DOOM mask with MF DOOM collab shoes which is going to look pretty dope.
mfdoom,3cd6r9,JPtheJedi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:16 2015 UTC,I would consider trading you but mine arrived with a totally busted tape... going to try to email them about this
mfdoom,3cd6r9,LookOutForTheWam,2,Tue Jul 7 05:47:55 2015 UTC,Lol are you referring to the tape inside the package? That's just creative package cushioning they used like how easter baskets have green stuff in it. It's intended to keep the items inside from colliding and damaging themselves during shipping.

mfdoom,3cd6r9,djchozen91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:44 2015 UTC,Can someone post up what's in it? Mine's still on it's way.
mfdoom,3cd6r9,djchozen91,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:32:47 2015 UTC,"I can make an image a bit later, but there are two packages:  a) instrumental tape, T-shirt, small moleskin notebook with a small DOOM logo, videopen spy pen with a DOOM logo.  b)  instrumental tape, T-shirt, large leatherbound notebook with larger DOOM logo, small normal pen with a small DOOM."
mfdoom,3cd6r9,ThereCanBeOnly_Juan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"What I'm not getting is, is the instrumental tape an actual previously unreleased DOOM beat? Because according to the letter in the package i've seen, for the competition it mentions recording a rap over it to receive a unreleased beat. So im confused... Do you just get an even rarer beat as a reward?"
mfdoom,3cd6r9,djchozen91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:33:29 2015 UTC,exactomundo.
mfdoom,3cd6r9,powtown9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"So the one in the package IS a previously unreleased beat, limited to the packages?"
mfdoom,3cd6r9,powtown9,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:31 2015 UTC,Yes. But all of us who bought the package (and the entire internet) now have that beat.  If you win the comp you get your own new DOOM beat. If you're a rapper good enough to win the competition then an exclusive DOOM instrumental is a pretty big deal.
mfdoom,3cd6r9,powtown9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"I get it. But still, the amount of packages bought/sold was quite limited. And even though you can rip the cassette for everyone to hear online (as you could with the prize instrumental), the original tapes themselves still must be worth a bit."
mfdoom,3cd6r9,powtown9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I have the larger notebook and small pen I was looking for a trade for what you have. I am ready to trade if you still are. Thanks!"

mfdoom,3c1gbz,ArmorPlatedGuardRail,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:22 2015 UTC,Press the button on top. A small blue LED should light up while it's filming
