Austin,3e2kaw,mannpig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:24 2015 UTC,They rarely close old fulfillment centers. More and more regional centers need to be created all the time to keep up with revenue growth: http://i.imgur.com/Xow6IVa.png

Austin,3e2fcy,ATX_native,5,Tue Jul 21 14:16:46 2015 UTC,Welcome to Austin!  If they tested Barton Creek for bacteria I am sure it would be off the chart.  If you don't know when the trail T's and you head right to Hamilton Pool take a left instead next time.  That way leads to the Pedernales River and a very peaceful area on the banks.  It's really nice and relaxing... You can take a book or just wade and enjoy solitude.

They also had some oddball acts like Balcones Fault who definitely didn't fall into the country or western catagory. They were sort of vaudevilleish/mothers of inventionesque/dixieland jazzy/lunatic rock. What ever genre that is ??? You'll see the one album they released in the used lp bins around town from time to time and it's totally worth the $6-8 it's usually priced for.

That building won hands down.  It was understandable since this was back in the early 90's when the metal face of the building (on the Guadalupe side) had been damaged or something and had a bunch of non-matching metal pieces patched onto it, so it kind of looked like it belonged in a shanty town. It looks a lot better now."

There was one studio for ACL tapings and then across the way KLRU shot some of its shows (Central Texas Gardener, etc.) and their pledge drives.  I remember standing in line a lot. They'd shepherd people into the elevators (which were down the hall from the NPR studio), get taken up to the 6th floor and be greeted by a couple of big tables of Ziegenbock beer. Sometimes there'd be tables in the ACL studio, sometimes it was standing room. I'd always try to get a side bleacher seat."

If they saw me carrying that bike, and even stopped and asked about it, I would have explained,  and we would have laughed at what a moron the student with the bike was. Jesus Christ, who let you dimwitted fucks out without supervision?"
Austin,3e02by,JesusWhataBother,6,Tue Jul 21 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd just have to ask why everyone should have assumed your were BFFs with UTPD from your story? Because the way you wrote it, it sounded idiotic. Actually it still does."

Austin,3dzuap,LoudMusic,36,Tue Jul 21 12:43:02 2015 UTC,Maybe the Golden Chick or McDs has some camera footage?
Austin,3dzuap,funkmastamatt,26,Mon Jul 20 21:42:48 2015 UTC,The nearest Golden Chick is the one off Rundberg/Lamar... not surprising.  If I recall there is a McDs right next to it as well.
Austin,3dzuap,funkmastamatt,18,Mon Jul 20 21:55:55 2015 UTC,thanks for that
Austin,3dzuap,marri3d4life,16,Mon Jul 20 22:15:03 2015 UTC,I went up to that Golden Chick and the manager checked for any transactions with the card number. No luck. By tomorrow the credit card company should have the location. I'm really surprised they were unable to obtain that information today.
Austin,3dzuap,wsupfoo,8,Mon Jul 20 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"As a system analyst of an EFT system for VISA/MC, somebody at that company definitely has the auth information as soon as the completion message is received at the terminal.  The store manager might not have access to that until the next day (probably via electronic reporting) but he or she could probably get that info if they really wanted to help you out right now."
Austin,3dzuap,mrsfunkyjunk,5,Tue Jul 21 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"to be fair, access to production transactions is tightly controlled for payments companies.  you don't want it otherwise..."
Austin,3dzuap,yosemitedamn,5,Tue Jul 21 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"There is a Golden Chick and McDonald's kinda close off of S. 1st. The Golden Chick at Stassney and the McDonald's at William Cannon. Of course, that's way farther south. And with traffic it's unlikely they got that far before y'all canceled it. But, you never know.   Hope your wife is alright. Mentally, she's probably not so much, but physically I hope it's not too bad. That really sucks."
Austin,3dzuap,Zachmo417,4,Tue Jul 21 02:49:06 2015 UTC,They are also across the street from each other at airport just south of oak springs.

My purse was stolen and 2 weeks later they came by my house (got address from license) and tried to steal my car.  Luckily I had the ignition key reprogrammed just in case so they weren't able to take it.

Austin,3dzuap,16bitBeetle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:52 2015 UTC,"I offered food to a guest and she turned it down saying she was vegan or something.

Austin,3dzuap,inbl,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"If I'm eating over someone's and have to deny eating their cooked food because of my diet-restriction I always want to explain it because I don't want to insult their cooking. I had a really bad incident when  I was younger with a friend's mom who had some really rough mental issues and when I wouldn't eat the bacon she ate, she flipped out and kicked me (12 yrs old) out of her house with no where to go because she thought I didn't like her food. There's this weird stigma against vegans/vegetarians and I think thats why everyone gets so irritated when someone mentions it. You wouldn't get irritated if someone eats only gluten free though lmao."
Austin,3dzuap,Krynnyth,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"I was raised to believe that refusing food offered to you in another's home is rude unless you have a good reason that you explain to the person offering you the food. Being vegan is a good reason. Marshmallows are made with gelatin, which is made from bones, and the brownie has egg in it. Why would you be irritated at her saying she's vegan? Are you sensitive about something?"

Because they sell gift cards, keeping the source as liquid as possible before the card shuts down.  I've been chasing these fraudsters for years.  Fast food and small transactions are becoming more popular because its a quick grab that nobody questions.  Walmart is also one of the biggest offenders for the same reasons as selling gift cards.  Prepaid wireless cards, same thing.  Get the money off the card as fast as possible that way you can use it later."

I compiled a couple of stores that I believe may have some visuals on the bastard. Check these places first: Walgreens on the corner, ABC bank on McNeil, ACM Car Service, Chase Bank parallel to ABC bank, Prosperity Bank on the side road, and Jiffi Lube parallel to Prosperity Bank. From there if no footage is seen you need to check the neighbor hoods by that area. It is most likely the man had seen the neighborhood and used the neighborhood as a means to get out of the area without other drivers or CCTV. He may have went North to Anderson W which means he would get caught by the ARC on the road. Other wise if he kept going W onto Spicewood, there aren't many businesses he would get caught on. If he continued on 183 N then he most likely will be caught somewhere. If he gotten the the neighbor hood NW of the corner he may have caught by the N Audi dealership. If you don't get any luck just PM and I love see if I can help in any way."

Also BBQ 512 on the other side, but it's much smaller and the wrong direction. If this guy was driving drunk, he probably frequents the same place.  Go check them out. Have a beer or two and keep an eye out. Visit on the same day of the week about 1-2hrs before the incident occurred.  Based on your description I would check Cajun Pizza and Water Tank. Maybe also Little Woodrow's down at the end (Parmer and McNeil). If he lived back off 183, McNeil is the usual route.  SOURCE: Was a functional alcoholic for years. Every one of us has a routine."

It is a huge house of 5,000+ square feet. The owner had it on the market for a while, but who would buy the biggest house in a neighborhood? So, if you can't sell a house, you rent it. The owner put three or more beds in each of the bedrooms and advertised it as a party house. Great for weddings!

Travis County gained, on average, somewhere in the range of 8,505 (IRS) to 9,200 (ACS) people per year from other states during 2008-2012, including approximately 1,000 (ACS) to 1,400 (IRS) from California."
Austin,3e06si,funkmastamatt,3,Tue Jul 21 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of folks only recently moved here in the past couple of years.  I think the 08/09 drag the averages down, once you see metrics for 2012/13/14/15, you'll see a significant change.  I think you'll see a boom in numbers for 12/13/14, and it slows down a bit in 15, once those metrics are finally released.    So the title, while technically true, is dated and should probably have included 06-12 in it."
Austin,3e06si,blueeyes_austin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. I pointed this out in my summary above and so does the KUT article and original Civic Analytics publication. It ultimately is limited by the release of data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the IRS SOI Migration Data. Neither of these seem motivated towards providing frequent or recent updates so it's inevitable that we'll be lagging behind by several years.
Austin,3e06si,Solus2167,6,Tue Jul 21 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"Last time I remember reading this, the top county was Williamson, which makes sense.  What these stats don't account for are the people who move into Wilco and then to Travis, or vice versa.  Curious how it would look if they included Williamson County in the equation."
Austin,3e06si,blueeyes_austin,9,Tue Jul 21 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"Some move to Williamson, but you see a lot of swirl of movement into Travis and then from Travis to Williamson."
Austin,3e06si,fairlydecent,13,Tue Jul 21 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is a lot less than I thought. While standing in a long line at HEB once, a bunch of people got into a conversation about where they were from. Every single person was from California, except me. It hadn't occurred to me until that moment just how many Californians live here."
Austin,3e06si,Unsocialsocialist,12,Tue Jul 21 01:54:02 2015 UTC,I suspect that the number of Californians moving here since 2012 (end of data used in study) has probably increased.

Austin,3e06si,EasyE0287,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it is the outsized economic impact that Silicon Valley transplants have. The influx of money is disruptive (no pun intended, tech-bro). I don't think the kids moving from Big Spring to go to UT or ACC are the ones causing the major cultural and economic changes.   I'd like to see the net Texan move-ins that are non-student."
Austin,3e06si,rocksteadybebop,19,Tue Jul 21 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"From the study this is based on:   Well can we at least blame them for rising home prices?  Sadly, this, too, is problematic, or at least unclear. Using the IRS migration data (2011), adjusted gross income per return (household) for people moving from California to Travis County was $78,384, well above the $67,118 for existing Travis County residents (non-movers), but well below some other states.  Illinois, for example, sends one-third as many people to Travis County as California, but adjusted gross income per return for Illinois transplants was nearly twice that of California ($148,173), according to IRS data (2011). In fact, people moving to Travis County from seven other states had higher adjusted gross incomes per return than people moving to Travis County from California that year. While the aggregate impact of more Californians with higher than average incomes moving to Travis County may outweigh the impact of other, even higher income states with fewer transplants, Californians are not the wealthiest people moving here, at least on average."
Austin,3e06si,reuterrat,4,Tue Jul 21 00:39:42 2015 UTC,"True, but people from Illinois tend to go with the flow rather then create their own disruptive flow."
Austin,3e06si,conciergecto,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"I hardly imagine something like that is quantifiable. I know plenty of people from states other than California that are more ""disruptive"" than the Californians I know. But then again, personal anecdote isn't exactly the greatest evidence."
Austin,3e06si,greatmagnus,6,Tue Jul 21 01:24:31 2015 UTC,I would be more interested in somehow seeing where buyers of houses and condos came from. That's the disruptive part. Coming to Texas for the few high paying tech jobs with California house price expectations.

When you take into account people leaving Travis County:   Travis County gained, on average, somewhere in the range of 8,505 (IRS) to 9,200 (ACS) people per year from other states during 2008-2012.

Per the original Civic Analytics study:   The estimated number of people moving from California to Travis County annually between 2008 and 2012 ranged from approximately 3,800 (IRS, 2011 reporting year) to 4,400 (ACS).    Net migration (move-ins – move-outs) from other states is more of a factor in Travis County’s overall population growth. Travis County gained, on average, somewhere in the range of 8,505 (IRS) to 9,200 (ACS) people per year from other states during 2008-2012, including approximately 1,000 (ACS) to 1,400 (IRS) from California."

TxDOT has over 86,000 miles of roads they must spread the money over and cities like Houston and the DFW Metroplex have received the majority over the years. The Austin area is scheduled to begin getting an influx of upgrades, repairs and modifications over the next 10-15 years but it will be a slow and painful process with much complaining because there are not enough skilled workers, Inspectors and laborers that can afford to live within a reasonable distance to expedite the work. Workers will not stay if it costs most of their paycheck to live a reasonable distance away and non degreed workers will eventually migrate to other parts where their income and cost of living are on par. Currently most of the Highway Contractors working in the Austin area (especially at night) are bringing in workers from other parts of Texas, and paying for them to stay in hotels, because workers from Central Texas cannot afford to work for the rates being paid."

Either one can pay for it, and solve the transportation issue. This is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation, why not step in and build a decent transportation network between San Marcos, Austin, and link it to the existing one to Round Rock? Once you have those, connected volume will be enough that the cities can start building out the smaller networks. It doesn't even need to be high speed."

Austin,3dz05q,goalslammer,10,Mon Jul 20 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"The non-partisan case is something like this--whether public or private, transportation investment:  1)encourages people to switch away from automobile usage, reducing traffic time/damage to roads and increasing air quality  2)helps businesses minimize costs (caused by improved reliability of the transportation of inputs/goods/services/workers)  3)improves labor market conditions (by enabling workers to move more easily between firms)  Now, whether or not Austin would benefit from constructing a light rail depends on whether or not it will be utilized, which the article states. My urban/regional econ professor used Barcelona as an example of a city that was perfect for rails: because most people live close enough to the station to walk, there is little reason to impose the cost of owning a vehicle (that, and people actually pay the true cost of using a vehicle via [gasp!] the gas taxes...)  Unless we can stop ourselves from turning into Houston (which is a textbook example of how NOT to let a city develop), it seems likely that the light rail will not only be politically unfeasible, but economically unfeasible as well.   tl;dr build Austin up, tax gasoline consumption (that's right, I said it), and then bring on the light rail (but not necessarily in that order)"
Austin,3dz05q,txjudoka,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:26 2015 UTC,"If you use the example of the Ruhrgebiet as this is a metroplex area, people that are too far to walk to a train station and can't take a bus to a train station use the park and ride option. So there are stations with plenty of parking outside the city to get people on the train into the city. They also have different trains between cities and everything in on the same time table. So adapt it to Texas San Antonio and Austin should have a train going between both cities and they also should have a train system in the cities  that are in the same time table and they are working with the bus system. This could bring down the traffic between San Antonio and Austin by at least 25% and maybe even more."
Austin,3dz05q,DAT_SAT,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"If there are enough daily commuters moving between Austin and San Antonio, I would be behind that.   Another idea that I've heard to reduce congestion is to get large trucks to use the toll roads as much as possible.   If we want to fix our congestion problems, for the short run the most obvious thing to do is place restrictions on throwing up cookie-cutter communities throughout the city, and promote mixed-use development (see: walkable neighborhoods) in the areas bordering downtown (of course, NIMBYs on the left and right will make this impossible) while trying to promote the use of services like Uber/Lyft and Capital Metro (though, to be honest, buses aren't that great of a solution) with something like a gas tax. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would be a start.  edit: spelling/details"
Austin,3dz05q,txjudoka,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"It was hard to find numbers while being on my phone but it's said that between 1604 in SA and San Marcos there are 127800 that travel per day. I would imagine that the are not all coming or going to San Marcos and most will go to Austin or further. Also truck traffic I'm the USA went up by 2% but between Austin and SA it went up by 6%. Also at least 100 people lose their life in crashes between this two cities.  With trucks the problem is that from Mexico to the north east of the USA this is the main road they take so yes trucks from or to Mexico should be made to travel on toll roads as one 120,000 lbs truck does as much damage as 50,000 cars.  I would believe that it would be most effective to have a high speed train starting in SA near 1604 and ending somewhere in Austin and on both ends you would have a transit station that has more trains going out into the city. Also in other cities busses are working very well to transport people just in Texas I have seen that the cities mess up bus schedules to make it unattractive to use them.  In Austin the transit station could be near the airport and from there you have three lines going out. One that goes to UT Austin and the further north, one goes all the way west and one goes straight north from the airport. On the east west probably one from NW hills in the ES direction, one on height is UT Austin and maybe a 3rs line somewhere. In SA it's a little more complex as how the city was build but it would probably be in a star system to have a 2nd transit center downtown and all trains go and come from downtown to the outside and two loop lines near 410 a d 1604."
Austin,3dz05q,DAT_SAT,7,Mon Jul 20 22:46:20 2015 UTC,get large trucks to use the toll roads as much as possible   Would this really make a difference? MoPac is congested during rush hour and has very few large trucks
Austin,3dz05q,elHuron,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"As a conservative, I'm all about smart rail. I am against building rail just for the sake of building rail, and I think the Red Line along with last year's bond measures were both bad ideas.   If we're going to get a full fledged rail system in place, we need to start with the core and build from there. A Riverside / Red River rail would make sense as part of an existing rail system, but it made no sense as part of a very limited rail system. It was also, mile for mile, some of the if not the most expensive rail laid down ever. Subsidizing mass transit makes sense and I'm more than OK with it, but up to a certain point.   There needs to be a large time and/or money advantage to make mass transit desirable. Contrary to public opinion people don't hate mass transit because it's gross or because it's for poor people, they hate it because it's a big hassle right now with no advantages for most people.   All of that being said, rapid buses with priority transit lanes are a great idea for far cheaper. The Mopac toll lane bus routes will be a very attractive option for people who live up north when a 45 minute drive can be a 20 minute bus ride. Why don't we just pave some road that'd mirror last year's bond measure, and instead of laying track down get some buses going? It'd accomplish the same thing for far, far cheaper."
Austin,3dz05q,pavlovs_log,4,Mon Jul 20 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"The Red Line is a commuter rail that runs at/over capacity during peak hours and weekend nights. Cap Metro ordered 2 new trains for the Red Line to double the frequency, and allow even more commuters to use the line. My sympathies if you are not able to use the line, but as someone who lived near it for over a year, it was absolutely amazing."
Austin,3dz05q,EasyE0287,4,Mon Jul 20 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"I think it has worked great for many people. I work with a few people who love it and use it daily.   I just wonder if the money spent on the red line could have been put to better use to benefit even more people. A ""needs of the many"" kind of deal. I've heard CapMetro made a few cuts when the Red Line started for instance."
Austin,3dz05q,pavlovs_log,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"I rarely go downtown, but managed to see a show at the Paramount Theater last month. I live within a mile of the Lakeline station, so I thought it would be a great chance for me to check out the rail line. Couldn't do it- the last bus leaves downtown at 6:30 pm on weeknights. I thought that was a little ridiculous. Austin has things going on every night of the week, so they need to expand that schedule."
Austin,3dz05q,Solus2167,3,Tue Jul 21 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"Expansion would be great, truly. However, the redline is just a commuter line, and on the week days that's all it serves (the 9-5ers). The line does run until 12:30 am and 12:00 am on Friday and Saturday, respectively, though."
Austin,3dz05q,EasyE0287,4,Tue Jul 21 02:15:59 2015 UTC,"The good news is by the end of 2016 we should see the red line running at much more reasonable hours.  The main reason for the 630 cutoff is the trains are not currently FRA compliant to operate with freight traffic. As a result, the only way the FRA allows the red line to operate is with the line completely cleared of freight traffic.  Part of the recent TxDOT / Tiger grants Cap Metro got was allocated for making the trains satisfy FRA alternative compliance, which allows such trains, with additional reinforcements, to run with freight traffic in the same lines. This same train set has been OKed by the FRA in other transit districts, so this isn't uncharted territory.  Also, it was rumored that by the end of 2015, the FRA would issue new rules allowing European standards train sets to operate with mixed freight traffic. This would be a huge win and step toward using existing rail for more transit options."
Austin,3dz05q,TsarKartoshka,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:56 2015 UTC,main reason for the 630 cutoff is the trains are not currently FRA compliant to operate with freight traffic.   Where could I learn these kind of facts? I've wondered about that for a long time.
Austin,3dz05q,elHuron,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really know if there is a conservative case for buses. From an economic standpoint, they're terribly inefficient for a number of reasons, especially if we're worried about traffic congestion.  Obviously, buses are a cheaper option versus light rail construction in the accounting sense, but what about the damage they cause to the roads? Emissions? Their contribution to increasing commute times (remember, for the most part these buses will be chugging along in traffic, without their own lane on MoPac)? These are all costs that bus systems impose on other people.  The only advantage of a bus system is the expediency to meet short-run fluctuations in demand; more people want public transportation, more buses on the road."
Austin,3dz05q,txjudoka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"When I speak of buses vs rail, I mean having true BRT with dedicated bus only lanes where we'd lay rail. Obviously we can't make every bus route get a dedicated lane, but we could do a few strategic ones and it'd be a huge win with as much advantage as rail.   The bus transit lanes downtown are a good start, lets work on extending it next down the drag so buses get their own lane from Cesar Chavez to Guadalupe and 35th."
Austin,3dz05q,pavlovs_log,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"Extending those lanes on the drag would definitely be the single biggest boost for the buses. The drag is also due for a design update to make it a friendlier design for pedestrians -- those lanes would help with that.   Regarding the MoPac project, one unfortunate design decision that will impact bus routes heading downtown is the only entry / exit points will be Parmer, just south of Far West, and Cesar Chavez. All of the bus routes currently use 35th to cut over to downtown."
Austin,3dz05q,TsarKartoshka,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough; I sort of misunderstood what you were getting at. A bunch of strategic routes could do a lot of good, if they had their own lanes, but then as you said in your first post it becomes a matter of whether or not we can get people to use the buses.  For the most part, it seems people are willing to eat a great deal of costs in exchange for using their own vehicle. As I've said previously in this thread, a gas tax really would be the most practical way to push people toward alternatives (short of a negative oil shock). People might say ""$8 per gallon?! I'll still use my F-150!"", but basic economics shows us that most people would change their habits before too long (demand for gas is inelastic only in the short run, iirc)."

Austin,3dz05q,amfarrell,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"Will it? I haven't ready anything that indicates that a gas tax will automatically make rents increase...why just rents, though? Keep in mind I'm not just advocating a gas tax, but also a few other things as well.  This kinda smacks of the same logic found in blanket statements like ""an increase in the minimum wage is inflationary"" (which, for the record, it isn't), but then again maybe you know something I don't?"

Target seems to be starting to support it too but not that many have been added to the map I'm tracking them on yet.  Also, it's so weird that clerks aren't fans of NFC though.

Austin,3dz7ht,tmiw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"NFC still seems slower than swiping, plus less overall experience with it by both cashiers and customers. Once EMV gets going they'll probably start to prefer NFC since that's faster than dipping."

Austin,3dz7ht,kuoirad,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:46 2015 UTC,"I worked as the overseer of Visa/MC at a different credit union, and there are several reason why EMV isn't a thing yet.    1) Too many PIN networks in the US which creates a lot of red tape and politics.  Other smaller countries converted to EMV with ease due to having a government-owned single PIN network.   2) We are having a hard time trying to decide on application standards.  The EMV chip holds ""apps"" such as visa, mc, and future applications.  A lot of banks are afraid to make large investments in card stock because the application standard (and space) can change.  You wouldn't want to buy a million pieces of blank stock and then discover you couldn't write your info onto the chip because the space was too small.   3) We are slow to enforce new standards.  In October of this year, most merchants (there are some exceptions) are suggested to start processing EMV if available.  If they read the magstripe instead, they are on the hook for any fraudulent charge claims if any arise.    4) Banks and credit unions usually hire out their EFT processing to a larger company.  Most credit unions use Fiserv or Symitar for their credit card processing.  That's the 3rd party system that is doing all of the real-time fraud checking and handing the authorization messages to merchants.  It's a huge deal for these monster companies to make the switch to EMV.    5) Often you will see EMV issued with international business cards.  It isn't as complex as our EMV standards and it's been around for years.  Many countries no longer read magnetic strips so EMV is the only way.    Also, when EMV first gets going, it won't be any more secure than your current card.  In the transition phase, there will by hybrid cards that have both the mag stripe and the EMV.  The biggest threat to the security of the card is the unecrypted magnetic strip. Also, in the beginning you will sign as normal.  But later on, you will have to enter a 6-digit PIN instead of a signature.  That goes back to the philosophy of two-factor authentication, which is having two or more of the following:  what you know, what you have, and what you are.  In future EMV-land, what you know is your PIN, and what you have is an EMV card that (in theory) cannot be counterfeited.  This protects you against card-copiers and also the other scenario where you card is physical stolen.    So for now, and for the next few years, EMV will be nothing fancier than reading a chip instead of a stripe.  The real security will happen when the magstripe goes away and we are forced to enter a PIN with every transaction."
Austin,3dz7ht,krankie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"Your information feels out of date. Most of that really only applies to the debit side anyway; credit EMV is well sorted with banks and credit unions big and small missing cards.  The debit standards exist and the big banks are issuing debit cards with both the common debit app that's the solution for the multiple PIN networks, and either the Visa or MasterCard debit app. But it still seems totally broken on the merchant side.  Most everywhere is still supporting magnetic stripe cards and countries that still have been issuing EMV cards for years still have magnetic stripes on them. The magnetic stripe isn't a big problem so long as merchants actually start accepting EMV cards. Chip and Signature is still more secure than magnetic stripe since it prevents cloned card fraud, which is a much bigger problem than lost and stolen card fraud, which is what the PIN actually protects against.  Also, PINs should be 4 digits, not 6."
Austin,3dz7ht,hawaiian717,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"Could be out of date.  I quit that job two years ago.  Are you sure about the 4 digit pin?  Because I know for a fact back in when I was in the initial talks with my EFT switch, they were hell-bent on a 6 digit PIN.  Of course chip+sig more or less eliminates the possibility of counterfeit cards (where 99% of fraud is occurring) but I wonder how merchants will deal with counterfeit cards that present mag strip instead of EMV? The October merchant liability shift states that a merchant must accept EMV if available, but what if the card had no EMV chip because it was counterfeit to begin with?  Are they still liable for the chargeback?"
Austin,3dz7ht,krankie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"Everything I've heard talks about making sure your card has a 4 digit PIN before going overseas, since some people have longer PINs on their debit cards that overseas ATMs might not support. I remember when I first got an ATM card in, I want to say, 1988, it was a 6 digit PIN, but every account since had a shorter 4 digit PIN.  From what I understand, the magnetic stripe includes a ""service code"" that indicates that the card is EMV and should be used in an EMV reader. I don't know if it's possible for a cloned card to modify the service code or not and still be valid (like if the magnetic stripe data contained something akin to a digital signature that couldn't be recreated without the bank's private keys).  If it is, then that should be an instant red flag to the merchant that the terminal is telling the customer to dip the card but it doesn't have a chip.  If the service code can be modified, I wonder if it's included with the magstripe transaction data sent to the bank. If so, their fraud detection algorithms could detect that the card claims not to have a chip, but the account is marked as having an chip card issued.  Finally, I think swiped EMV cards in EMV terminals are signaled as ""fallback"" transactions, so if the service code can be modified and the service code isn't transmitted, it seems that the bank could detect something amiss if the transaction comes through as swiped and not fallback from an EMV terminal."

Austin tries and often comes up short. Austin is great, and I love it, but there's really no comparing the city planning and concern for diversity on the level that Portland does it."
Austin,3duzuh,prommie_k,9,Sun Jul 19 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that Portland is better than Austin at managing growth, it's that the entire state of Oregon is better at managing growth than Texas.  Urban growth boundaries throughout the state in Oregon prevent the urban sprawl that exists in Texas (and pretty much the rest of the US).  I would be a little cautious arguing about diversity since my observations (and census data) would show that Austin is more racially diverse than Portland.  I would agree that Portland shows more concern about it, but it's another thing to actually deal with it along with the history that Austin has."

I don't know when you were in Portland (obviously) but this isn't true anymore, at least. People are being priced out of the city center, and home values across the river are getting pretty bad. The only decently priced places now are out in Gresham or out toward Hillsboro. There are still some houses around Rosa Parks that are decently priced, but it probably won't be that way soon.

Austin,3duzuh,prommie_k,13,Tue Jul 21 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"Austin tries and often comes up short.   That's mostly because Austin and the rest of Texas is blessed with our beloved Lege.  Remember folks, the Lege hates Austin."

Austin,3duzuh,elHuron,-4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:12 2015 UTC,nothing weird about Austin. Just a bunch of Americans from all over and then some. So if you think multi culture and diversity is weird then I guess so but anything that used to be Austin is getting melted away in the pot that is our economy.  People down vote because Austinite’s believe the vibe that was in our city for so long is going if not gone. Talk to any local whose been here 20+ years the city as we knew it is gone. Its just like the rest of America now. THANKS!

Is Eyore's Birthday considered ""weird""?  When you say ""it is just like the rest of America now"" I think of strip malls and traffic, in which case I agree.  However, it is still a fairly compact city and much of the core is bikeable if not walkable, so in that regard it is probably better than the rest of America."

Austin,3dv0cm,remember_citadel,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm ... maybe. To be voluntary manslaughter, the victim would have had to do something that would have provoked the assault from a ""reasonable person."" If a reasonable person would not have lost it under the circumstances, then it bumps up to second-degree murder.  It appears to be a heat of passion murder, according to KVUE.  But he also attempted to conceal his victim's injuries. Which may bump it up from first degree manslaughter. Kinda armchairing the legal analysis a bit but that's my thinking."
Austin,3dv0cm,jordanmc109,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"Sec. 19.02.  MURDER.  (a)  In this section: (1)  ""Adequate cause"" means cause that would commonly produce a degree of anger, rage, resentment, or terror in a person of ordinary temper, sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection. (2)  ""Sudden passion"" means passion directly caused by and arising out of provocation by the individual killed or another acting with the person killed which passion arises at the time of the offense and is not solely the result of former provocation. (b)  A person commits an offense if he: (1)  intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual; (2)  intends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual;  or (3)  commits or attempts to commit a felony, other than manslaughter, and in the course of and in furtherance of the commission or attempt, or in immediate flight from the commission or attempt, he commits or attempts to commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual. (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), an offense under this section is a felony of the first degree. (d)  At the punishment stage of a trial, the defendant may raise the issue as to whether he caused the death under the immediate influence of sudden passion arising from an adequate cause.  If the defendant proves the issue in the affirmative by a preponderance of the evidence, the offense is a felony of the second degree.   To me it is clearly murder on point 2. But at the punishment stage he may get the second degree felony instead of the first degree felony."

Austin,3dvpwi,Oznog99,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"Well it's something running the battery down (like a trunk light that doesn't turn off), the alternator is dead, the battery is shot and cannot recharge again, a bad engine ground, or just bad battery terminals.   There's an important point-  if your alternator is dead, then jumpstarting will only get you a few blocks before the voltage drops again and the computer doesn't have enough voltage to keep the engine running.  Or the alternator may decide to work again for another week then stop putting out current again.  If the alternator is bad, even giving a new battery or giving it a full charge overnight may only make it run for another hour.  Without the alternator, the fans and headlights will run the battery dead again shortly.  But check the battery terminals first.  If they're not tight and/or corroded it can be real quick to fix.  Also broken accessory belt- but you'll lose AC and power steering like 45 min before the engine quits, you would have mentioned that."

Austin,3dy016,GENEROUSMILLIONAIRE,-8,Mon Jul 20 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. They should always have one of the dogs chained up so it can never get near the other dog. That's a good life for a dog to live."
Austin,3dy016,NoSuchUserExists,4,Mon Jul 20 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"Look kid, what you are sarcasticly suggesting is irresponsible. My position is against irresponsibility. As in not having the infrastructure or patience to care for two dogs. Theres not a lot of info up there in the post but it says they tried training and it didn't work. Well, the reality is that training works on dogs if the owners have the patience to see it through.  Also, as someone who clearly has a firm grasp on pet responsibility, you already know that chaining a dog anywhere within the city limits is against the law. If you do see this happening you should call 311."
Austin,3dy016,GENEROUSMILLIONAIRE,3,Mon Jul 20 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"Dog aggression is not always a training issue. Some dogs are just aggressive towards others, and there isn't much to be done about it."
Austin,3dy016,sarah201,0,Mon Jul 20 21:02:14 2015 UTC,I personally try not to blame the breed because it sets people off. I have not actually seen a study that suggests one breed is more violent than another and would love to see one. The problem is usually defineing what constitutes certain breeds and breeds being mislabeled and taking percenteges into account instead of plain numbers.

If you do not have the room to safely seperate 2 large dogs you should not go get a puppy. If you believe that making an effort to be patient and waiting for training to work is a ""luxury"" when it comes to owning a pet you should not go out and get a puppy. If you think giving away a dog to a stranger on the internet is the responsible thing to do when you don't feel like providing a safe environment for your pets then you shouldn't go out and get a puppy   It is a completely indefensable position. The question is what do they do now that they have decided that they won't make the effort to follow through with their responsibilities. What they have chosen is not illegal and may even end up with the animal remaining alive and untortured, though that is certainly not gaurenteed. The solution I am proposing is that they follow through with the responsibility that they took upon themselves. This appears to be a difficult task for them. Thus: responsibility is a bitch. With a play on the word bitch.  Edit: oh boy, time to figure out what gold does!"
Austin,3dy016,GENEROUSMILLIONAIRE,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"From the original post, you can not tell anything about the sequence of events that led to this situation.  My best guess is that they had a dog that was rarely around other dogs so they had no idea how it would behave.  Then they got a dog from a shelter and were told he was great with other dogs.  That is a huge mistake but most people don't realize it until they have already made the mistake.  You should always do an interaction with existing pets before finalizing the adoption of a new pet.  Most rescues require it; some shelters encourage it but don't require it.  But it really doesn't matter what they should have done because it is already done and they cannot change the past.  So the problem they now have to solve is what to do with the 2 dogs.  The responsible thing to do is separate the 2 dogs and for most people that means getting rid of one of them."
Austin,3dy016,sxzxnnx,0,Mon Jul 20 21:44:02 2015 UTC,So you believe that giving a dog to a stranger on the internet is more responsible than training an aggressive dog to be manageable and providing a safe environment?
Austin,3dy016,GENEROUSMILLIONAIRE,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"With proper vetting of the stranger, yes.  You keep acting like giving a dog to a stranger on the internet is the worst thing in the world but that is, in fact, how most dog adoptions are done.  Rescues, shelters, and private parties place adoption ads on the internet and then screen the interested adopters to choose a suitable home.    If either of my 2 dogs were trying to kill the other, I would not leave them together and hope that my training would take."
Austin,3dy016,sxzxnnx,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:24 2015 UTC,Good point. Just because these owners completely dropped the ball on making shure they were good owners does not mean they wont find a good owner.

Austin,3dyvg8,Pjp288710,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Vastly superior venue, I wonder how the capacity differs..."
Austin,3dyvg8,bancroftjem,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know the official numbers on Stubb's (the correct answer there is as many people as they can without getting shut down), ACL Live has to be a bit bigger."
Austin,3dyvg8,Pjp288710,0,Mon Jul 20 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm...Could be a date conflict then, or C3 doesn't do as many ACL Live events...Dunno..I would much rather see them at Moody than Stubbs though."
Austin,3dyvg8,bancroftjem,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Official capacity for Moody Theater is more than double that of Stubb's - but if you have ever been to Stubb's during SXSW (when the fire marshall enforcing ""official capacity"") you know that the correct answer is, indeed, ""as many people as they can without getting shut down.""  Wilco played Moody the last time they were in town un-related to the ACL Festival. The show was good, and as much as I prefer Moody, frankly, I always enjoy the 2 night stands they have done at Stubb's versus one night at a big theater where I might have to sit."
Austin,3dyvg8,chadio11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to any outdoor shows at Stubb's yet, I went to an indoor one this April and had a good time. I have friends that go to a lot of shows and they all complain about the sound and how many people they jam in there. I love Wilco though, and haven't seen them live in awhile so I'll suck it up and stand with the rest of ATX :)"
Austin,3dyvg8,bancroftjem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"I got standing floor tickets to see the last ACL Live show, thought it was wayyy better. Also prefer not to support any Live Nation/C3 shows; don't think all big companies are evil, but they certainly are."
Austin,3dyvg8,Pjp288710,3,Mon Jul 20 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"Looks like they're using STARWARS for the Kalamazoo date.   Given how these codes are rarely venue-specific, I'd say that's a pretty safe bet for the Stubb's presale."

Austin,3dyvg8,bancroftjem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:12 2015 UTC,I just went to the presale link on C3's website: Pre-sale passcodes are sent in our weekly newsletter on Wednesdays at 1 pm. You must confirm your subscription before this time in order to receive the pre-sale passcodes for that week.
Austin,3dyvg8,bancroftjem,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the album was a surprise release last Friday (as was the tour announcement). So, last Wednesday's newsletter didn't have a pre-sale code for Wilco, and the pre-sale is this Wednesday."

Chip seal is often used to repair minor cracks in the road, or to prevent moisture seepage on existing pavement. It is common practice to use on low-volume/speed urban roads, so to lengthen the useful life of the pavement base."
Austin,3dwfwb,EasyE0287,7,Mon Jul 20 03:03:14 2015 UTC,They do it because it's a whole lot cheaper and less polluting than replacing the road all the way to the roadbed every five or six years.
Austin,3dwfwb,superspeck,10,Mon Jul 20 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"We do this because we want challenge the cyclists of the city to not slip in the massive gravel patch at every intersection, to grow even thicker skin as each pebble flings from passing cars, and to fully enjoy the ultimate road rash when falling off their bike. Plus, we're cheap and it's the cheapest solution."

Austin,3dtpf5,ANewDinosaur,46,Sun Jul 19 10:43:44 2015 UTC,This is one of the most hilarious post title/thumbnail match ups I've ever seen on reddit. Who lets a baby wearing a batman shirt into a bar? How did they let him gt away ? He doesn't even look old enough to walk let alone run. And all this time we were worried about the baby Penguin.   Edit: I really hope the venue still paid the bands. This is really a shitty thing to do.
Austin,3dtpf5,dreadredJ,-11,Sun Jul 19 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"I work at this bar. Yes we paid the bands, obviously. And also the photo of the baby at the bar was the owners baby during a manager meeting during the day. Get off your high horse, bro."
Austin,3dtpf5,greenphosphene,9,Mon Jul 20 05:45:52 2015 UTC,"Woah woah woah buddy. First off it's not obvious you paid the bands. I know plenty of bands that have been stiffed on their pay by plenty of bars before and those bars didn't have their door cash stolen as an excuse. I never said you didn't pay them I just said I hope you did ( and I'm glad you did). The shitty thing I was refering to was this guy robbing your door guy. (Btw , door guy was probably in on it )  As for the baby , all I was doing was pointing out the thumbnail/post title combo. "" anyone recognize this jerk"" next to an infant wearing a batman shirt. Reddit doesn't let you pick your pic when you link to FB or news sites so there are often strange pictures alongside some  posts , and this is one of them. It was a joke bro , but hey thanks for reminding me why I don't go to shity bars with pretentious asshat employees."
Austin,3dtpf5,dreadredJ,14,Mon Jul 20 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"Clearly a hand off, fire the door guy and hire better people."
Austin,3dtpf5,bannedfromphotograph,11,Sun Jul 19 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Upon second watch, I'm inclined to agree. The door person seems to be switching between nonchalant conversation with the person off-screen and glancing anxiously in the thief's direction. They even seem to get impatient and stick the bag out more conspicuously near the end."
Austin,3dtpf5,jlongr,8,Sun Jul 19 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the reason I noticed the first time is because I had no idea who to watch, I was just like ""when does this anxious asshole get up and run"" ..""oh wait that's the door guy"""
Austin,3dtpf5,bannedfromphotograph,4,Sun Jul 19 19:55:50 2015 UTC,It sure does look like the bag was moved for easier grabbing.

Austin,3dtpf5,WoGeddy,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:50:38 2015 UTC,The door guy holding the bag made the thief's job fairly easy.

Austin,3dtpf5,Greven132,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:05 2015 UTC,I've never seen a purse snatching in my life... But I'm still wary that it could happen anywhere at anytime.

Austin,3dtpf5,jwmatx,6,Mon Jul 20 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"So you wouldn't press charges? Or try to file an insurance claim? You'd just throw your arms up and blame yourself?  Where do you live, and what hours are you most typically not at home?"
Austin,3dtpf5,Slypenslyde,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have to press charges is all I'm saying.  I've held concerts before where you leave some cash in a bag at the door but if that bag has anything over $40 in it, then it should be put in a cash register or a safe until later on, when the bands are paid out or whatever the case may be.  I'm not advocating for the thief, I'm simply saying that this thief didn't exactly pull the heist of the century."
Austin,3dtpf5,FatFreddysCatnip,6,Sun Jul 19 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"There is always someone like you when these types of events occur. It almost seems like you are trolling because of the ridiculous nature of your claim. No one should live in constant fear of this type of thing. It's like saying ""well if you didn't want to get murdered then it's your fault for not spending your days in your basement with a loaded shotgun. The moment you step outside you make it really easy for someone to kill you"".   I can only assume that you having thieving tendencies to be comfortable with such a mindset."
Austin,3dtpf5,msirelyt,3,Sun Jul 19 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with living in ""constant fear"". It's about being vigilant when one of your duties is ensuring that the money makes it to the safe at the end of the night. Casually holding the bag under your arm while jaw-jacking with people around you doesn't accomplish this part of the job."
Austin,3dtpf5,jbirdkerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"It's about being vigilant when one of your duties is ensuring that the money makes it to the safe at the end of the night.   I have never had a job that involved handling money where this was part of my duties.  I've always been told that if someone wants the money, give it to them, because a lost register is better than a dead employee.  Door people stand around with money all the time, and unless the owner is willing to pay for a drop box to be installed at the entrance, I don't see how this could have been avoided."
Austin,3dtpf5,Greven132,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Drop box or even a cash box bolted to a stool, desk or wall. Seems like this was a crime of opportunity."
Austin,3dtpf5,rockaletaaa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:36 2015 UTC,You're right. This person should be clenching the bag with both hands and constantly looking around for muggers.
Austin,3dtpf5,msirelyt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"Again, what's with the extremes? There is a middle ground between pants-shittingly scared and being oblivious to surroundings. Sucks that the guys was the victim of a douchey crime but I'm sure he learned a lesson about being observant."
Austin,3dtpf5,jbirdkerr,5,Sun Jul 19 21:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the alternative point of view is extreme too (""You should just be able to let your guard down!"").  It's not one or the other. Yes, the thief is ultimately responsible for the theft. Yes, you can take steps to make theft more difficult. Yes, it sucks that this would be necessary."
Austin,3dtpf5,happywaffle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:58 2015 UTC,True but this person isn't being that loose with their property. They are simply holding it like anyone else would.

Austin,3dye9e,BlindDark,5,Mon Jul 20 15:28:00 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to get them for free. Especially when they can be sold to the public and/or the incredible amount of local breweries that might want to reuse them (like Jester King).  As you said, your best bet is to call around to some local wineries and get some estimates. If they're close enough, you'd at least save on shipping.  Mind if I ask what they're going to be used for? If you're brewing something of your own (beer or wine), there are cheaper alternatives than an entire barrel."
Austin,3dye9e,jamie79512,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:44 2015 UTC,It's actually for decor. I need three barrels that I will clean up and use to create a bar (pirate theme) so even knock off barrels would work so long as they can support weight. They don't even have to be quality barrels as I will be able to give them the look I want.
Austin,3dye9e,jamie79512,3,Mon Jul 20 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"There are actually quite a few people who buy wine/beer/spirit barrels for decor purposes. They've been pretty hot the last few years.  Many places charge $300+ for wine barrel furniture items (with little to no modification). Hell this place charges $55 just to rent a wine barrel. So if you found them for sale for $60/barrel, that's probably your best bet even with shipping.  You could also try making your own since they don't have to function for fermentation, but I imagine tools alone would be more expensive than just buying them."
Austin,3dye9e,ZeroChad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:32 2015 UTC,You might try contacting Adelberts.  They were selling used Jack barrels a while ago.
Austin,3dye9e,imsoupercereal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, wine and whiskey/bourbon barrels are in high demand for a variety of projects that people are working on.  $60 doesn't sound bad at all"

Austin,3dye9e,Walking_billboard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"If you can find them, $60 is a pretty good deal.   You might call around to nurseries, they sometime have half-barrels (as in, cut in half) which people use as garden planters."
Austin,3dye9e,sweet_static,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"If they're for a bar(business, not just at your house) you can likely get one through a representative of the several wine and spirits reps you'll have coming in there after you open but they'll be branded and expect you to carry said brands."

It worries me that someone's expensive gadget could experience a failure and fall into the crowd and injure someone.  It's distracting and unnerving and detracts from the experience.
Austin,3du1v0,Gonzo96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"I get the concerns but if it makes you feel better I have flown this for a year, never have crashed or experienced a failure of any kind. I do safety/technical checks before every flight. As far as it being distracting, the band asked me to come out and film it and you could not hear it over the music. On top of all that, I only flew it for 10 minutes while the band was playing, not any other time.  edit: I also spoke with APD officers at the event who gave me the ok."

They were selling a used Spyderco Paramilitary 2 for $225, so that's nice i guess. Everything was overpriced massively or total junk. A lady in a skintight top and an middle aged guy were behind the building throwing knives. They had no sharpening equiment for sale other than a small diamond stone. It was really weird and it looks like its on the verge of shutting down. Btw they ruined my parents kictchen knives a few years ago, their sharpening put a ""dip"" in the middle of a German-style chefs knife. Free recurve i guess!"

Survived a winter (physically, not emotionally) and decided to move back to Texas and chose Austin.    Best advice?  If you want to live in Austin, then LIVE IN AUSTIN.  What I mean is, don't make the mistake (as I did) of thinking ""well, city X is only 15 miles out and so much cheaper, we can just live there and drive an extra 15 minutes""  No.  It's never ""just 15"" minutes.  It's 45 and it gets old fast.  You will find yourself staying in city X more and more.  Then it's pointless.    Leander, cedar park, buda, Elgin, Georgetown, round rock, Pflugerville and Manor... IS NOT AUSTIN.   The money you ""save"" is gobbled up on gas/tolls/time/energy in a hurry.  If you only want to pop in the city on weekends then ok, but you will be with about a million other people doing the same thing.    There is nothing wrong with those places.  If that is what you are looking for.... But they are not Austin and you will quickly realize it.  You may find you are ok with it.  Maybe you don't go out too much.  But if you plan on enjoying Austin then live here.  Not near.  Not close.  Not 15 minutes away.  Live here.  (If you can't tell, I made this mistake.  I didn't realize just how soul crushingly far out I really lived until having to commute one terrible week from 2 exits south of Town Lake to fucking Leander.  And Leander is affordable for a reason.  Sure there are new nice houses popping up but the only thing here is HEB, nothing else)  currently looking for new residence IN Austin"

The only counterpoint I would say to this is that the OP has a kid, so school quality becomes a much bigger issue. AISD still has some significant issues, especially in many of the schools fed by core Austin, so unless they are willing to go private, many of the outer areas have much better school districts."

It's doesn't even run out here on weekends.  You have to drive to Lakeline and at that point I might as well drive the extra 15 min vs 45 min train ride to one destination.  Again, something I wish I had researched before picking here.  Coming from Chicago, I saw a train and just assumed it would run 7 days a week.

Hint: lakes, land, views.  Generally if you don't feel like you're in quintessential central Texas you're screwing up but you can screw up in Austin proper just as easy.

Austin,3dwb1i,ChicagoByTexas,12,Mon Jul 20 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"The traffic? Not as bad as other places I've lived (NYC, Chicago, Detroit)  The weather? I'd take 110 over -20 and a couple feet of snow any day of the week. When it's hot you can get out on the water. When it's cold you can only barricade yourself in your shelter and curse your existence.   What I love?  I've never been to a city where nature and city are more intertwined. For $500 less than I was paying for a bedroom with a beautiful view of a brick wall in NYC, I live on a lake and am a 20 minute walk (down a beautiful nature trail) to downtown. E Riverside isn't that expensive, and for all those who say it's ""ghetto"", Detroit makes E Riverside look like Beverly Hills. I mean, we have a Starbucks and a Chipotle, but I rarely eat there because all the authentic Mexican places in walking distance are so much better. And I went kayaking in my backyard this morning.  As everyone else has mentioned, any outdoor activity you might enjoy you can do here. Cliff jumping is my personal favorite. Outdoor wonderland.  All the non-outdoor activities. The free live music here is way better than the $20 shows everywhere else. And I can't think of a single thing I could do in NYC that I can't do here.  The food... again, after living in one of the most eclectic food cities in the world I'm not missing anything.  But my favorite thing about Austin? I've never been anywhere in the world where the average person is as happy and genuinely friendly. Today I just joined in a pickup ultimate frisbee game and got invited to a BBQ at a local's home. It was an amazing time, everyone could not have been more wonderful, and I made a lot of new friends. I'm pretty sure the city of Austin puts something in the water, because I can't believe people are this happy and friendly.  The complainers really don't know how good they have it.

Austin,3dwb1i,BaldassAntenna,4,Mon Jul 20 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Europe 5+ years ago to join my other half. I have lived in about ten countries so far; most in Europe, one in Southern America. I have not always spoken the local language in all of the countries I've lived, and English is my third language. I have never owned - or leased - a car.  So the challenges I face are a bit different. Here a few Austin vs Other Places I've lived in comparisons:  Texas is very car-centric in culture. People drive everywhere.  There is the public transport, and e.g. the new MetroRapid buses are nice, but they are not always enough. If you can ride a bicycle (safely) to a bus stop, that can make your commute a lot less car-stressful. Many people use their tablets or read while they commute in buses; they feel safe and comfortable. If only I could just walk to a bus stop it'd make my travels so much more independent. But nope: I can not cross 183 safely. So I rely on a ride to the bus stop.  People drive everywhere also after drinking. Because a cab ride would be insanely expensive/there was no plan or gackup plan for getting wasted/there was no couch you could have crashed on after drinking. The difference just seems to be ingrained in culture or thinking habits. In Europe if you drink, you don't drive when you are not in a safe condition.  Sometimes even a crash in daytime involving a woman with her own and others' children in her car, and a bystander tree involved alcohol. (""Lady, why are you driving around drunk at 2.30PM with children?""). I'm probably a bit too passionate about this - but I walk. I even run. I use the crosswalks, and I just hope I'll never have close encounters with those who are too intoxicated to stop.  Austin is great for outdoors activities. So much outdoors and enjoyable most of the year. Run, hike, canoe, bike, swim... Great for individuals and families.  It would be a pity to just live here and spend all evenings in front of a TV screen.  Same goes for many cultural activities, and food culture. So many great places around here. Get a library card; it'll be a lot of fun with your kid. Use the library. And look for fun volunteering and exploring options too.  All these outdoors, culture, and food scenes are fantastic. But make sure you have your own support networks available. Family, friends (religious support network, whatever you use in your life to rely on)... Austin can be rough if you fall (out of work, family, health). People are often polite and kind here, yet in all these years I don't feel like I have any local Really Good Friends. Or I have but they live all over the city/country/world, and I so rarely meet any of them in person they might as well live in Europe..."

I've lived in Boulder, Chicago, Orlando, Kansas City, and San Diego.  I visited Austin off and on throughout the years and always like it and a job transfer brought me here.  Honestly, Ive been disappointed overall.  I think it has the expense and congestion of a large city without the benefits. I also think the road system and drivers here are the worst Ive ever experienced inside the U.S.  I also think the people here have evolved.  This city used to exhibit Southern hospitality when Id visit here years ago, but that is a ever shrinking culture that I don't think will ever come back.  There are some great things that this city had going for it, though.  Live music, vibrant bar scene, outdoor activities, and a great job market.  Tech here is extremely strong and growing every year.  The area is beautiful - between hills and all the water - very unique.  I wouldn't fault anybody for living here and if you are younger I can't think of too many places that are better.    But, having lived in some other states, I just don't think it is on par to other places and my wife and I will be packing up and moving once our lease is up.  Just  not our cup of tea."
Austin,3dwb1i,beardownbeardown,5,Mon Jul 20 20:49:59 2015 UTC,I think it all depends on what you like to do.
Austin,3dwb1i,StFirebringer,8,Mon Jul 20 02:08:42 2015 UTC,Do you have a job lined up?  No? Don't move here.  Traffic is horrible.  Rent only goes up.  Summers are too hot.  But I love it here.
Austin,3dwb1i,defroach84,3,Mon Jul 20 02:55:59 2015 UTC,I moved here with no job prospects and locked something down within a week. It's much easier to find a job in Austin than most of the rest of the country.
Austin,3dwb1i,mad_regal,4,Mon Jul 20 13:12:55 2015 UTC,"If you're in a higher level professional job it's a little harder than that. You want to be selective about employer, location, benefits. And it's common for the interview process to last a month, followed by 1-2 weeks before your start date.  I'd say if you're moving here without anything lined up or in the pipeline, you might wait 2-4 months until you're sitting at your desk on day 1 of your new job.  Now if you're doing call center work, customer service, or lower level professional positions, you can probably get settled pretty quickly."
Austin,3dwb1i,Kuriye,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:52:55 2015 UTC,This in a nutshell describes Austin to a T.
Austin,3dwb1i,elphabaisfae,5,Mon Jul 20 13:03:29 2015 UTC,"Just moved from Birmingham Alabama. Biggest issue I have so far is the lack of diversity. Traffic is not that big of a deal, just do your research. Ignore the negative people (this IS reddit, after all)."
Austin,3dwb1i,BBHoss,6,Mon Jul 20 03:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Amercians confuse ""diversity"" with ""large African-American population.""  Austin has four ethnic/racial groups with a population over 5%:  Non-Hispanic White (49%), Hispanic (35%), African-American (8%) and Asian (6%).  Birmingham only has two groups with a population over 5%:  African-American (73%) and Non-Hispanic White (22%).  By any measure, Austin is a more diverse city than Birmingham (unless your definition of diversity is ""large African-American population"", which I think is a misunderstanding of the word diversity.  By that definition, a city which is 100% African-American would be the most diverse city in America, even though it would technically be completely homogeneous.)  Edit:  Furthermore, Austin has a foreign-born population of 18%.  Birmingham's is 4%.  I've not been to Birmingham, but I suspect that Austin is much more cosmopolitan."
Austin,3dwb1i,delugetheory,5,Mon Jul 20 15:01:26 2015 UTC,"That's not what I mean; I am aware of the statistics. What I mean is that most of the areas that I've been to are extremely homogenous when it comes to culture. Rainey St, West 6th, most places I've been to on E 6th are pretty much the same. There may be a large Hispanic population here, but I have not seen them well represented in many of the popular areas.  You don't have to listen to me, plenty has been written about the issue. Here's the first article I found by Google"
Austin,3dwb1i,BBHoss,4,Mon Jul 20 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I get what you're saying now.  I'm always baffled when I hear friends or associates describe Austin like it's 99% white people, because that is absolutely not my experience living here for 15 years.  But then I realize that their life basically involves driving back and forth from their home in Tarrytown to their tech job in Westlake, with the occasional trip to Whole Foods or Rainey Street.  That sort of lifestyle would definitely give the impression that Austin is whitesville on the scale of Portland or Seattle or Denver.  Not saying that that describes you, /u/BBHoss, in any way shape or form--just always have to remind myself that people can live in the same city and see two completely different things.  Austin feels like a United Nations rainbow compared to some of the places I've lived, in and out of the US.  Anyway, welcome to Austin."
Austin,3dwb1i,delugetheory,3,Mon Jul 20 22:12:04 2015 UTC,Exactly this
Austin,3dwb1i,Austiny1,5,Mon Jul 20 20:40:12 2015 UTC,"yes. get used to white people everywhere. after d.c., nyc and downtown houston, it took awhile to get used to this. not that it's a huge negative, just that the lack of diversity is obvious if you've ever lived in a city with any diversity."
Austin,3dwb1i,d_the_head,0,Mon Jul 20 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Austin seems quite ... white indeed. But it's got its regional mixes too. I live in an area with a lot of Asian implants, and... Many people seem to acknowledge the existence of oer people only within their comfort groups. People of some ethnic backgrounds seem to mingle together and not blend. Or even say ""good morning"" to a neighbor of a different tone or ethnicity, but - I guess it's the same elsewhere in this country too?  Ethnic food scenes are pretty decent. Especially if you get to know something about a regional cuisine or a few that interest you. And for starting with something, pho is an essential taste or Austin."
Austin,3dwb1i,Unuhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what others say, I would encourage you to look at the suburbs if you're interested in coming here.  I'm in the same situation as you - 30s, have a small child, husband has a tech job, I work 30 hrs/week.  We moved to Round Rock last year (a northern suburb) and it's exactly the place for us to be in this stage in life.  We were previously inside Austin and the issue we faced was that to find a good school inside Austin we had ZERO ability to afford the homes.  Schools vary considerably inside AISD and so this is important.  We chose a list of schools we would be happy with and found a house inside those parameters.  We are in Round Rock, husband works in north Austin, his commute is about 25 minutes each way.  I work on UT campus, so mine is about 45 minutes.  The neighborhoods inside Austin that have good schools are too expensive for most people to afford, especially on one salary.    It will not be like living in downtown Austin, don't think that it will.  But Austin is close enough that we are downtown for something on the weekends pretty much every week, but no you will not be partying downtown on a Tuesday night.  Like others have said, do not even think about moving here without a job.    I moved from Kansas years ago.  My issue was the heat.  I figured oh it gets up in the 100s in Kansas, I can handle this.  Yes, the temperatures are the same, but the relentlessness of summer is what killed me.  Where other parts of the country retreat inside for winter, here you do that for July and August.  Traffic is relentless.  Cost of living going higher and higher is also relentless.  But after 12 years, I can't imagine living anywhere else."
Austin,3dwb1i,tah4349,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Kansas and Texas are similar in heat extents and humidity, it just lasts longer here. At least, that's my experience."
Austin,3dwb1i,elphabaisfae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly like that.  In Kansas the really high heat would last for two weeks.  Here it's two months."
Austin,3dwb1i,tah4349,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"My wife, 3 year old son (at the time) and I moved to Round Rock, a suburb North of Austin 4 years ago.  I'm a ""boomerang"". I went to UT, left, lived all over the country (IA, CA, NJ, DC, NC) but had the opportunity to leave our 7 hear home in Raleigh, NC for a new job. My wife moved around with me, but is a North Carolina native, so she left more of her friends an family behind.  Bottom line... We couldn't be happier.  For me, the suburbs were an adjustment. I had lived in larger cities and in South Austin as well so suburban life here took some getting used to. I still make a point to head downtown for games, concerts, meetings, etc, but the comforts of suburbia are excellent especially at your age and with a young child. The public schools in Austin are not so great but are outstanding a few miles North. Do your reseach but this will likely be a factor in where you live.  My wife was a harder sell. The heat can be rough for a newcomer. Don't plan on doing anything outside during the summer months unless it involves water. That's not too hard to do as there are pools, rivers, lakes and water parks not too far away. My wife loves the culture, diversity and friendliness of Austin. We recently took a trip to the East Coast and were reminded of the everyday rudeness you see on the street, in restaurants and visiting businesses. I'm not saying that you won't find rude people here but in my experience, it's the exception rather than the rule.  I highly recommend raising your child here. As mentioned, the schools are very highly rated and the environment is very accommodating to all types of children. Personally, I was worried that by leaving Austin, we run into the neo-conservative and religous zealot types, I knew when living outside of Dallas, but that's not so prevalent here. Also, there are several great resources for little ones here. From youth sports to splash pads to gymnastic classes, there's really no end to what you can do here with your child. Check out freefuninaustin.com as they detail so much free or cheap family activity you can do with your little one.  Good luck!"
Austin,3dwb1i,Texas11219,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Texas about an hour north of Austin. I left in my 20s and lived in NYC for a while. As weird as this sounds, having lived in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, Austin is about as metro as you can find in Texas. Obviously Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are bigger but I honestly feel there is more to do here. I am inclined to the outdoors and love all that Austin has to offer in that aspect. I do miss the NE weather but I like the cold and end up indoors more during the summer than I'd like. This year has been crazy with the weather, having only lived here 5 years I still don't know what is normal and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.   Also, traffic sucks in certain parts of the city as bad as I have ever seen.  Honestly I said all of that to say this, every city can be what you make it if you want. I would suggest having  job first the market is hot and fast."
Austin,3dwb1i,m4verick03,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:12 2015 UTC,If you were here the summer of 2011 that was bad even by our standards. We had 90 days of 100+ degree days. Even for Texans it was bad. Our hottest day ever has been 112 which we've hit a couple of times. You appreciate a/c and enjoy your water or iced tea!
Austin,3dwb1i,kosmickoyote,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"Man, I was outside all day at 112. Standing in Lake Austin drinking and going off the rope swing.  112 and 97 aren't that different."
Austin,3dwb1i,nojacket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:27 2015 UTC,Mentally they are very different. I can handle the 97 but once it hits 100 it seems worse. The first time it hit 112 in 2000 I was stuck in traffic on IH35. I swore I'd move someplace cooler yet I'm still here.
Austin,3dwb1i,kosmickoyote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"Not a transplant but the best advice I can give is make sure that you don't mind heat.  This summer has been extremely mild, usually it is hot for months at a time.  I would not live anywhere else in Texas however,  and of the places I've visited in the US Austin is the place I continue to choose to call home.  Enjoy your visit in September!"
Austin,3dwb1i,mrsparkleo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"Five years. Still here. Probably not leaving too soon. Big enough city to have something for everyone. Worth giving a shot.   You may want to investigate TX schools for the kiddo. From what I hear, they are not the greatest."
Austin,3dwb1i,MaximRivers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:14 2015 UTC,"September will still be warm almost as bad as July and August. We don't have traditional seasons. Winter is short. Austin rarely has snow, it is usually the northern burbs that get snow ever few years. Ice we do get and every 5 to 10 years and we get a doozie. On the other hand, they can threaten ice and businesses will close and stores sell out of bread and milk then you realize it was just an overzealous meteorologist when nothing happens. Coming from up north you will be amused.  Have a job before moving. Austin is a tech and government town. Because you have a child you will need to look closely at the schools before choosing where to live, probably not Austin proper. Austin housing has gone through the roof with everyone moving here. People are not kidding when they say traffic is bad, it is.   If you like the outdoors there is plenty to do but with anyplace it is what you make it."
Austin,3dwb1i,kosmickoyote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"I lived in MN.  Sometime in 2005, I had decided there were three things I would never do:  Get married, move out of MN, and quit smoking.  Within a year, I had done all three (I married a homesick Texan, we moved here, and I quit smoking for a spell).  Three years ago, however, we got divorced.  Were it not for her, I don't think I ever would have moved here.  Thing is, there's really nothing calling my name anywhere else, I have a pretty good setup here, and I hate moving, so I'm apt to stay, but if there were another job, a friend, or a family member that beckoned me, I'd seriously consider it.    The MN winters were oftentimes unbearable, but the spring, summer and fall more than made up for it.  Completely the opposite in TX:  Summer can suck, but the winter makes you forget that the summer even existed."
Austin,3dwb1i,Jelsol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"I moved from out of state, Virginia.  3 years ago.  If you want the Austin experience you think you hear of, live in Austin City Limits, or just recognize that being 5-10 miles out is Texas.  But it is too expensive and I saw the comment about schools, so farther out may be better.  EANES district, west of Austin, is rated high.  Some schools are Cedar Creek Elementary, Hill Country Middle School and West Lake High School - I can attest are all good for my kids.  Grocery stores are cheaper than east coast. My parents visit and are amazed, and produce is better, since it's probably closer from Mexico.  I have never lived so close to outdoor things to do - I live in Zilker, and to Town Lake quickly, and enjoy it daily.  It makes a difference to be so close to outdoors things.  Remember that if you decide to live in the suburbs and it's a drive to do anything.  I looked all over before buying a home, and the house prices and rent, I felt are pretty high, or similar to my northern Virginia prices.  I think if you're willing to live far out of town, it may be better, but there is a lot of inflated house prices because demand is larger than supply.  Enjoy Austin!"
Austin,3dwb1i,comoxbc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, Ohioan! I grew up in Ohio as well, just outside of Columbus, and have spent most of my life there and in Kansas City so I can offer the Midwest perspective.   Fall/Winter/Spring are all very awesome seasons here compared to the Midwest. You get one unbearable few months of heat in the Summer, but I'll take that over Ohio winters any day of the week. I'm sure there will be a day or two that will be the exception in the future because there are always outliers, but you can say goodbye to your ice scraper, winter boots / snow clothes, heavy winter coats, and salt for the driveway. It's friggin' awesome! Nature. Like someone else mentioned in this thread, nature and Austin go hand in hand. There are a lot of outside activities and recreation. It's also more eco-conscious than a lot of places. It took me awhile to get used to bringing my own reuseable bags everywhere, but I'm really proud of living in a city that does things like that.  The traffic. It sucks compared to Cbus and has the adverse effect of keeping you somewhat close to your immediate neighborhood at time. I would suggest finding a place you really like and trying to live close to it, otherwise you're going to get weary of making 45 minute trips across town to the places you want to visit.  The neighborhoods. There are so many pockets of awesome in this city, and I'm constantly finding new ones. One of the prevailing qualities I appreciate about Austin is how there aren't just one or two ""cool spots"" - there are countless. And new ones sprout up all the time, because there's culture to back it up. The people. Hands down, the friendliest, happiest people overall. With any big city, there's hooligans and undesirables, but for the most part they're my favorite part about Austin. People are wonderful, welcoming, and inclusive - I've made several friends out of complete strangers that I just so happened to strike up a conversation with, and that's awesome to me. The culture, I could write a book about. Also worth mentioning that Austinites LOVE Austin, and they look out for each other. There is a lot of city pride here. The food. Oh my glob. Just... go find some Austin food blogs. The food trucks. The BBQ. The breakfast tacos. The Tex-Mex. The authentic Mex."
Austin,3dwb1i,Ymbryne,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Dallas a few years ago, which I moved to from Phoenix a few years before that.  I like the nature in Austin, but generally I try to stay about 5 miles out of the city. the weather changes often enough to stay interesting, and there are tons of tech jobs. finding good value housing is a pain, but possible.  the people are just about as cool as anywhere else I've lived.  I plan on moving back to Dallas soon"
Austin,3dwb1i,lurkin_yer_gherkin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"Moved from another state back in February 12 because of my now ex-fiance.  My kid was born here in 13. Still here.  I'm hoping that your job can move with you; if not, don't even consider coming here without a job. I came here without a job, and while I was able to find one here and there (I have a broad skillset for some areas and incredibly specific for others) until I landed my job at Apple, it was kind of scary to pay bills or be able to afford things. Even now, making more money than I ever have in my life, I can pay for the basics, and maybe one or two special things a month, and that's it. (I put almost 10% into my 401k though for savings, so I guess that's just my choice.)  Traffic isn't bad if you are intelligent and just live close to where you work. I live in NW Austin, my round trip commute from home > daycare > work and back is under 10 miles. I live 12-14 miles from downtown, which is the same distance that I lived from the ""bigger"" town in KS from my hometown, so I'm used to it. However, 15 minute drive in KS = 45+min here, if there is any sort of traffic.  I lived in the DC Metro Area and I took the metro everywhere. There is no public transit here; and yes, there's a 'bus line' and a 'rail line', but it's not usable. It's over an hour to go 12 miles to downtown from up here on a bus in no traffic. The train doesn't run downtown on Saturday afternoons.. why? I have no idea why, but it's one reason that I think Austin needs to get their shit together. I make visits downtown scarce because I don't like dealing with it. There's a lot to do, but I just don't do it. If there was effective public transit, I would do things downtown / other areas in town a lot more.   There's a lot of stuff to do outside here, which is awesome. Unless you have allergies and are sun sensitive; hence, hating the weather. I hate the weather. I hate hot weather and not having 4 seasons. I didn't realize how much I missed 4 seasons until I moved here (and I've lived in NC, where winter isn't that bad on the coast). This is a big factor for me when I decide where I'm going next (Des Moines, IA is high on my list for many reasons.)  Columbus is very very cheap compared to Austin. (I have friends that live there; for what I pay in rent for a 2/2 here I could have my own house with a yard there).   The reason I stay is that my job is here, but I'm not married to staying here throughout the rest of my life. In fact, I kind of doubt I will.  As for schools... you really need to do your homework. We're already discussing moving in 3 years to avoid the Texas School System in general. (Dad and I are against private schools, and while I am certified to teach, I'm also not wanting to homeschool and since my son is an only child, he needs the social aspect of school.) A lot will depend what happens in the state house in the next three years; I grew up in a small town in Kansas, and while we had some ""questionable"" things taught it's nothing like the slanting going on now.   It doesn't sound like you need daycare, but it's usually 4 digits a month if you do.   Hm, what else. You're from Columbus, you'll have a car, so you should be set there.  If you have questions, please let me know. :)"
Austin,3dwb1i,elphabaisfae,-4,Mon Jul 20 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"unless you're balling out of control, enjoy rasing a kid in an apartment that has rent going up $100+ every lease renew, or you want to sit in traffic every day for over an hour each way to drive out to georgetown as its the only place left in the area with reasonable housing cost.

Austin,3dqm90,Sirjimboiii,41,Sat Jul 18 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Obviously a passionate kid.  It's easy to dismiss his accident as dangerous stupidity but it's important to remember we don't know what happened in that car, he was licensed to handle dangerous animals and most importantly..... we've all been 18 and stupid. However, few people deserve to die for it.  Love the cobra jokes/twitter/stories, hate that a kid had to die for it.   Condolences to the friends and family if you see this, I know some of his associates are Redditors."

Austin,3dqm90,salt-the-skies,19,Sat Jul 18 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that he would take the time to show off his interests and passions to young kids. They got the chance to see and touch these animals up close, and that's an opportunity most will probably never have again.  It takes a special kind of person to reach out to kids and want to show them something new. Most of us keep our passions  to ourselves or share as far as our friends and family.  If this was a suicide and this was the way he chose to go, I can't imagine the pain he must have been suffering before and while waiting for the venom to take him.  I had a friend take his own life about 7 weeks ago. You can't even imagine what his family is going through. Even if it was an accidental death, no parent should ever have to bury one of their children.  I hope this puts into perspective how awful the cobra memorials are."

Austin,3dvsva,FerfNocket,4,Mon Jul 20 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"from personal experience, you go to TJ because they have certain items that they do really well and TJ in turn hopes you buy something else while you are there. You go to WF because if its on your shopping list, they probably have it and you can be confident in its quality, WF in turn hopes you will buy some of the things which has made them (in)famous as Whole Paycheck.   A hypothetical person might go to WF to do grocery shopping for the week and pick up a nice bottle of wine for a party. That same person might then later in the week go to get some table wine, and pick up a couple staples or TJ specialty items while they are there.  Edit: This should not be taken as an endorsement for Whole Foods or Trader Joes. I have a passion for food, and in all my travels I have been in few grocery stores that engage my love for food the way that Central Market does. If you share my passion I strongly recommend Central Market above all others."
Austin,3dvsva,right_foot_red,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:50 2015 UTC,I disagree. I do all my shopping at TJ's because I can buy all organic for way cheaper. WF's for specialty items.
Austin,3dvsva,FerfNocket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"I am specifically answering the question: how can two companies who apparently share a large part of their customer base not be directly competing? You are clearly not part of that overlap.  I have had enough experiences with TJ not having something that I need that if I have to ask, I assume they don't have it. So I only go there for those things that I know they do well, and while I'm there I look to see if anything catches my fancy.  I may be slightly biased, because I don't know if I can fully accept TJ into my life until they start stocking jalapenos in a jar."
Austin,3dvsva,imsoupercereal,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"Whole Food's focuses on organic, natural, etc.  Trader Joe's doesn't necessarily exclusively.  Whole Food's sources their own brand but plenty of other outside brands.  Trader Joe's, with the exception of some alcohol, brands everything as their own.  Further, TJ's only stocks 1 of each thing, like Creamy Peanut Butter.  They sampled all the creamy PB's and picked which they thought was the best.  They relabel it, and you get 1 choice if you want Creamy PB.  Most of the time this is an alright thing.  Trader Joe's has many more aspects that focus on the more frugal side of things while still focusing on high quality products.  Whole Foods isn't exactly gunning for low cost.  Whole Food's can be a nearly complete grocery shopping experience.  Trader Joe's doesn't necessarily cover every thing, and also has the limitation of their single branding approach.  Also, in general, TJ's stores are much smaller than Whole Foods.  WF also tends to focus on other areas: Smoothie Counter, In Store Bar, Cheese Counter, In Store Buffet and other prepared food, etc.  There's nothing wrong with either approach, and each serves their purpose.  I just think its very apples to oranges to compare the 2."

Austin,3drwo2,ebbst,9,Sat Jul 18 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Went to gtown high. This cop was a total dipshit. He was usually at our school doing dipshit things to students and he pretty much went unchecked. One time I was wandering around campus during classes taking pictures for yearbook and he stopped me in the hallway. ""I see you wandering around campus this time every day and I'm starting to think you're up to no good."" I had long hair, wore skate apparel, and was always out of the classroom during that time to take pictures and write notes with the camera and notepad I carried. I told him what I was up to and that i had permission from my teacher. He said, ""The teachers don't make the rules. I enforce different rules and you will follow them, you hear me kid?"" I walked away and said go fuck yourself under my breath. I don't know if he heard me exactly but he knew I said something. He said he was going to speak to my teacher and that i was lucky he was ""taking it easy on me this time."" I told him, ""ah man, I'd hate to get tazed for doing exactly what my teacher told me to do today. Don't be such a dick, dude."" I had to sneak around him for a while cause I'm sure he was looking for any reason to fuck with me again. after I told my teacher about it (she was super cool), she said ""LabRatsAteMyHomework, don't talk back to or underestimate that guy. He could really hurt one of you kids. Just be polite and respectful to him. He means well."" My anti-authority mindset didn't sit well with that, but I just avoided the guy till I graduated. Then a few years later he's all over the news for injuring students and now he potentially put an officer's or innocent bystanders' lives in danger. If that gun had to be used while on duty, the officer could've killed someone all in the result of some stupid ""lesson to be learned"". This guy has no regard for his community or coworkers and is a fucking flea. Glad he's out of a job."

And even then it took about an hour to separate the coffee sludge and grinds from the liquid.  Next time, I'm thinking I'll use cheesecloth as a giant coffee teabag and just squeeze it out when it's done."

Austin,3dt930,GoTexan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:25:25 2015 UTC,In this  scenario the amount that you can cold brew is limited to the size of your French press. If you want to make a large pitcher of cold brewed coffee then you need something to filter it  with.

Then I would call Williamson County and let them know you just moved there and need a registration form (they may also just move your registration address over the phone...they did this when I moved from Williamson to Travis last year). *See my edit below.  At this point you should be good to go.  The reason you want to fill out that form for address change is because, for example, if you get toll bills it goes to the address they have for registration.  If you don't pay because you didn't get the bill but you didn't change your registration address, that's on you.  *Edit: I reread your post - if you move AFTER you register you don't do anything different with registration, still register in Travis.

I've lived in Austin most of my life, so moving back I understand generally the good and bad places of Austin.   Do you mind saying what complex or even PMing me the complex you're in? Also, do you like your management, your neighbors and the area in general you're in?"
Austin,3dt930,elphabaisfae,4,Sun Jul 19 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Where are you going to be working? Live close to where you work.  If you're doing like a WFH, look up in the Arboretum area. Plenty of places up here. Apartment locators are helpful, as well.  I just got a new place, and my apartment locator found the best for me that I never even knew about."

Austin,3dt930,g192,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"The thing about apartment locators is they only deal with apartment complexes that will give them a referral. Most apartments will do this, but you're potentially missing out on a fair number of complexes when you choose to use a locator.  I tend to go with PadMapper and Zillow.  Before I first moved to Austin I actually just used Google Street View and saw a marquee outside of an apartment complex and called the number. Turned out to be the best landlord I've ever had. It was privately owned and any time I had a problem I could just contact the owner and get something fixed promptly without having to go through a management company."

I think this was true in 2004 when a locator refused to take me to an apartment I specifically asked to see, but since then I have made an apartment locator friend and she's never mentioned this.  She's seemingly honest with me about the process and has mentioned having difficulty getting her commission from complexes but has never said she only works with certain conplexes in an effort to get commission."

So my workplace installed a fancy Keurig machine, but get this -- they're not supplying any coffee pods for the machine -- if we want to use it, we have to bring our own.  I'm normally a french press type of guy, but it's just too much to deal with at work (and I usually have just one cup of coffee at work anyway).  I tried the Keurig machine with a Green Mountain coffee pod, and it didn't make a terrible cup of coffee, and it was really convenient.  So, I'm thinking about taking the plunge and getting some pods to keep at work -- and I would love to buy local.   Would be awesome if I could get Anderson's or Cuvee packaged in pods, but anything locally roasted would be great.  inb4 suggestions that I package it myself.  Honestly, I can't be fucked to bother with that."

Austin,3dt930,moundman84,5,Sun Jul 19 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"I use an aeropress at work (and at home, and on river trips).  It makes a single cup of ""espresso"" - rather a strong shot of coffee you can add water to.  Not as bitter as a French Press...makes really good joe.  The kicker is how damn easy it is to clean.  It literally cleans itself as you plunge it, then you just pop the grounds into the trash, rinse under water, and you are done.  No mess like a French Press.  As soon I went Aero at the office the French Press was instantly mothballed."

I use the aero press for my lone daily cup & feel that the process is both minimal (compared to both drip & French press) and totally worth it considering the control over quality. I'd rather spend that extra 30 seconds making a GREAT cup, personally. Of course if you never had to help with the cleanup/prep of your old office machine, I see how you'd want to avoid having to adopt a new routine. Good luck w/ your decision!"

Austin,3drtm6,ATX_rider,4,Sat Jul 18 21:22:30 2015 UTC,Narrow streets and low traffic speeds increase safety dramatically but obviously that's not possible everywhere.   Exactly.  Any attempt to drive in the Rainey neighborhood is a fool's errand.
Austin,3drtm6,realname13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"The hands free law is good, but it's not the problem.  Also 2015 might simply be a statistical aberration in terms of the number of traffic fatalities. Which is not to say we should accept any number above zero."
Austin,3drtm6,happywaffle,11,Mon Jul 20 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is that downtown, speed limits should be reduced to 20 mph. Maybe 25 on arterial roads. Fatality rates go up tremendously when speeds are higher than 20 mph.  As for the hands-free law, I still see a lot of people ignoring it.  If I had to guess though, I'd say the weather has been a pretty big factor. Slick roads and all."
Austin,3drtm6,EricTheLinguist,4,Sat Jul 18 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely on all counts.  One reason why Vision Zero is so important is that it provides an organized body to lobby for lower speed limits. Texas politicians do not like to lower speed limits, and this is reflected by state statute: Cities cannot lower speed limits below 25 mph without costly transportation studies.   With so many demands on the transportation department (such as signal-timing) it is often hard to justify the expense of reducing traffic speeds, especially when most people's chief complaint about traffic is not safety but congestion. This is why being organized around Vision Zero is so important."
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,4,Sat Jul 18 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"Huh?  If my chief complaint is traffic, how does organizing around reduced speeds and lower fatalities address this?  Additionally, when we're looking at fatality data, distracted and impaired driving are primary factors.  Perhaps those low hanging fruit need to be addressed before additional regulatory regimes are pursued? If there is insufficient police presence to enforce the hands free ordinance, do you think that they're going to step up enforcement of a zone that's seen a 10 mph speed reduction?  Fatalities would be further reduced by dropping the speed to 15 mph, which is about 15 mph faster than traffic moves on may roads during rush hour. Where does the march to speed reduction end?  Maybe we need to invest in better pedestrian and road infrastructure rather than engaging in lobbying activities related to speed limits when traffic is already naturally limiting driver speed during peak hours?  Austin couldn't build a straight road if it tried, lanes are too narrow, cyclists are not protected from traffic, many of the experiments that the city has done with cyclist protection have been poorly executed, helmets are not required, sidewalks and ADA compliance are non-existent throughout much of the city, lane striping is pathetic, crosswalks are poorly labeled, intersection signs are improperly placed, intersection visibility is not maintained, and the list goes on and on and on.  Rather than demanding some actual planning in this frankenstein city, we're going to lobby to further regulate drivers who are already too stupid to put their phone down when they're behind the wheel?   I'll pass, thanks."
Austin,3drtm6,dkesh,2,Sat Jul 18 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe we need to invest in better pedestrian and road infrastructure    Just as an FYI, we are engaging in better ped infrastructure downtown and it's awesome.  It's called the Great Streets program and it includes standards for street infrastructure, such as sidewalk width, street furniture (i.e. benches, etc.), street trees, and the like. It's funded mostly out of downtown parking meters.  I'm only skimming the arguments back and forth here so I don't know whose side this supports or opposes or whatever, I just really like the Great Streets program and want to make sure people know about it!"
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,0,Mon Jul 20 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not impressed with the new developments downtown as I've already mentioned here, but it is a miracle that sidewalks are being invested in at all here.  The end result is very slightly updated infrastructure that will need to be redone when the city realizes that runoff management, trees, space making, sidewalks, bike lanes, and vehicle lanes are all elements of a complete street in dense urban environments.  I anticipate this will be done some time around 2060 and Austinites will rave about how innovative it is, even though it will have been completed in numerous other cities decades prior.  Austin has had a chance to get it right with all the new development here, and the city has squandered the opportunity by pouring more concrete, plopping down a few benches and calling it good.  Labor and goods will always be more expensive tomorrow..."
Austin,3drtm6,HtownandDown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"which is about 15 mph faster than traffic moves on may roads during rush hour   Bullshit. As someone who lives and works downtown -- and who has lived in actual urban, pedestrian-oriented cities -- I can tell you that people do regularly drive over what is already a too-high speed limit for an area with that much pedestrian activity. Don't even try to tell me that congestion is at all times limiting traffic to sub-limit speeds. Maybe try driving when it isn't rush hour sometime? I've seen two pedestrians hit at crossings in the past year because of drivers who fly off 35 down 8th and take right turns too quickly.  On top of that, your argument is self-defeating. If people are already traveling 15 under during rush-hour, then reducing the limit by 15mph won't affect rush hour speeds. It will, however, alter driver behavior throughout the rest of the day, which is still going to bring down the number of pedestrian incidents.   Maybe we need to invest in better pedestrian and road infrastructure rather than engaging in lobbying activities over speed limits when traffic is already naturally limiting driver speed?   Uh, this isn't an either-or and that's certainly not an argument against reducing speeds. And it paints some silly picture where we're all pitching in money to make this happen and where we can only focus on one thing at once. And either way, any kind of change in this city is clearly going to require some organized political action, so I don't understand where your dismissal of lobbying is even coming from.  Yes, I am totally with you on investing in both more pedestrian and road and bike and all of the above infrastructure. But some blanket statement against lowering speed limits is just dumb."
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,6,Sun Jul 19 02:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of the people moving here have lived in pedestrian-oriented cities.  This isn't one yet, and to move in that direction requires investment with the end goal of increasing throughput without a corresponding hit to safety.  I'm not particularly interested in rush hour speeds. Those times of day will always be a shit show.  I'm concerned that you're advocating the creation of an opportunity for the City to extract more money from residents in the form of more ticket revenue without a corresponding increase in service, and slowing traffic when we should be trying to speed it up.  The city lacks major east-west corridors, and downtown is a critical path for residents and commuters. Reducing the flow of traffic through downtown will lead to even more delays on Mopac and i35, which shifts the problems out of downtown and into other areas rather than building comprehensive, cohesive, and sustainable solutions that employ standard design elements and language.  Standardization is essential when helping drivers and pedestrians maintain their focus (when they're not looking at their phones).  If China can manage this, so can we.  Their urban roadways range between 30-40 mph.  People are already having difficulty adapting to new hands free rules. You seem convinced that more ordinances or more restrictions are the solution.  Many of the problems you describe can be improved through infrastructure.  There will always be assholes, and there will always be human error, so engineering as much error out of the equation is the best solution in an environment with a rapidly increasing population."
Austin,3drtm6,HtownandDown,0,Sun Jul 19 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't one yet   I completely disagree. Downtown was built for pedestrians. Despite efforts in the post war period to fashion it for cars, Downtown is a place built for people on two legs, and that is who it should service first and foremost.   The city lacks major east-west corridors, and downtown is a critical path for residents and commuters.    Clearly a problem that needs to be solved in a different way. And hey, I'm not saying that 15th and Cesar Chavez need to be slowed, but the areas between them absolutely do.   which shifts the problems out of downtown and into other areas rather than building comprehensive, cohesive, and sustainable solutions that employ standard design elements and language   That's a bunch of blather. It is precisely the areas outside of Downtown that need to be reworked to better-handle the traffic load, because those are the areas that the city decided to design around the car, and because there's actually room for improvement outside of the Downtown grid. Downtown will never be a convenient place to drive, and trying to make it more so puts the pedestrians that Downtown Austin is actually built for in danger.   If China can manage this, so can we. Their urban roadways range between 30-40 mph   Lol, let's try to not use China as an example. I have lived in China and it's not exactly the safest place for either pedestrians or drivers. And by the way, there are plenty of downtown-like areas in Chinese cities where traffic calming measures like narrow streets slow car speeds for pedestrian safety. What China does is push the heavy traffic off onto wide boulevards rather than relying on limited-access highways, which they mainly employ for longer-distance travel -- as highways should be used. One of the biggest problems in these half-assed cities we've attempted to build in Texas is that we force so many short and medium distance drives onto our highways.   People are already having difficulty adapting to new hands free rules.   Comparing reduced speed limits to the hands-free rules is a reach. People are already accustomed to speed limits, and they're much more easily enforced.   ou seem convinced that more ordinances or more restrictions are the solution.   No, I'm not, and you're putting words into my mouth. I said that we need to reduce speeds downtown. That means changing the limits, sure, but I'd also be in favor of removing lanes of traffic and turning them into widened sidewalks.   Many of the problems you describe can be improved through infrastructure   Right. And some of that infrastructure -- at least downtown -- is going to come at the detriment of car traffic, and I'm totally down with that."
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,3,Sun Jul 19 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"So we shouldn't use Chinese infrastructure as an example, but then we're going to praise China for how they route traffic and use ""calming"" measures?  I can't keep up with you.  East/West travel downtown will not be hindered by infrastructure projects that balance the needs of drivers and pedestrians.  Your final sentence betrays an anti-driver agenda and is a dismissal of balanced approaches to a rapidly growing city.  You're advocating a race to the bottom rather than supporting model solutions that improve mobility for everyone.  This isn't putting words in your mouth, this is interpreting your perspective and rightfully rejecting it."
Austin,3drtm6,HtownandDown,0,Sun Jul 19 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"So we shouldn't use Chinese infrastructure as an example, but then we're going to praise China for how they route traffic and use ""calming"" measures?   Not at all what I said. China shouldn't be what we aspire to be, even if they do some things better. And I wasn't praising their slower urban streets, I was saying that your assertion that their urban roads move between 30-40 mph is a blanket statement and incorrect. If we're going to look for cities to model ourselves on, European cities like Berlin would be a better fit.   East/West travel downtown will not be hindered by infrastructure projects that balance the needs of drivers and pedestrians.    Yeah, that's just not realistic. Please, give me a concrete example of what a 'balanced' approach that improves mobility for everyone would be -- one that doesn't require ripping up blocks of downtown, please. The fact of the matter is that there isn't one -- improving the pedestrian experience of downtown Austin is going to require calming traffic down. Period. This isn't an anti-driver agenda. There are places in this city built for cars, and there are places built for people (and too few at that). And we're so used to prioritizing cars that it makes me sick -- and I'm pretty sure your 'balanced approach' language really just means that you won't ever prioritize pedestrians over drivers. Turn 183 into a highway the whole way, widen 2222, add lanes to 35, whatever -- I'm all for it. But the ways cars currently travel downtown is dangerous and detrimental to the growing pedestrian experience there, an experience that we need to nurture to get people out of their cars because we are in a growing city that will never be able to build enough road infrastructure to keep up with its growth.  Anyone who says, in a blanket statement, 'we don't need to lower speeds anywhere in Austin' doesn't know what they're taking about."
Austin,3drtm6,hiptobecubic,0,Sun Jul 19 19:11:44 2015 UTC,Amen.
Austin,3drtm6,EricTheLinguist,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Well considering the fact that downtown speeds are 30+ and in reality drivers go significantly faster, when really the spacing of blocks doesn't allow for it. I'd welcome an immediate reduction to 25 as a temporary stop-gap. Of course, I can only imagine the angry letters any reduction in speed would cause from the general public."
Austin,3drtm6,blueeyes_austin,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:44:37 2015 UTC,Do you even drive downtown?  Outside of rush hour on timed signal streets reducing to 20 or even 25 mph would be a disaster.

Austin,3drtm6,blueeyes_austin,0,Sun Jul 19 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"You posted ""facts""?  It is a fact that reducing speed reduces capacity of a road over time.  Your proposal will reduce the capacity of the downtown grid to handle vehicle traffic.  THAT is a fact."
Austin,3drtm6,photo1kjb,3,Sun Jul 19 15:13:09 2015 UTC,Actually no. That's not a fact. Reducing speeds through urban corridors often has no impact on traffic throughput and can increase throughput in some cases.
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:58 2015 UTC,Speeding is not a problem in Austin. Most drivers can't find their gas pedal.
Austin,3drtm6,blueeyes_austin,0,Sun Jul 19 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a fact.  If free flow speed is above the reduced speed and you artificially reduce free flow speed below that level you do reduce capacity."
Austin,3drtm6,mannnix,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Please. Stay out of downtown.
Austin,3drtm6,blueeyes_austin,2,Sun Jul 19 13:59:26 2015 UTC,Are you seriously arguing that road capacity is not a function of speed?

Austin,3drtm6,ATX_rider,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:28:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. My pick for greatly reducing the speed limit would be Barton Springs Road through Zilker Park. No one needs to drive 35 mph or more through that stretch of road. Particularly on the weekend. It's a park after all.

Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,2,Sun Jul 19 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"Lower speed doesn't usually equal better flow.  /u/ATX_rider That is a significant east/west corridor, and a lot can be done to maintain speeds while simultaneously improving walkability.  The city can accomplish this by removing the unnecessary medians, eliminating u-turn zones, moving greenery to the perimeter of the street where it serves as shade for pedestrians, install crosswalks and islands that facilitate safer crossing, and using the reclaimed median space to widen lanes and create dedicated cyclist lanes.  The bridge is not ADA compliant and is aging. It should be widened to improve safety for current traffic lanes, accommodate protected bike lanes, and bring sidewalks into compliance with ADA.  Additionally, a round-about should be installed at stratford drive (away from crosswalk) and all Zilker traffic directed to it.  If these things are done, 35 mph is a reasonable speed limit, and risks to cyclists and pedestrians can be substantially reduced."

Austin,3drtm6,g192,2,Sun Jul 19 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that it seems this ""task force"" is actually going to have a direct effect on decision making for the city's transportation going forward. These people are cherry-picking their data and not even attempting to use their brains to figure out the complexity of the situation.  Of course there are not going to be traffic fatalities when you are in the functional equivalent of a parking lot. At least the writer of this drivel wasn't so stupid as to advocate for the turning of the rest of Austin into a parking lot, but the writer's endorsement of Vision Zero is almost equally as dumb.   Vision Zero is bunk for the sole reason that you are legislating toward the lowest common denominator of the city. Normally, you make speed limits such that a normal or slightly distracted driver would have time to react accordingly to a change in their surroundings - e.g., a pedestrian stumbling out onto the street. Under the Vision Zero theory, you basically assume everyone who is driving is drunk and will not react to any change in their surroundings and will hit anything in the road - and that the best course of action is to simply reduce overall speeds to not-dangerous levels. That is insane.  Not to mention that the base concept of Vision Zero is impossible anyway. People are going to die in traffic accidents, and you're never going to be able to bring the number of fatalities to zero. It's a fact of life. I'm sure you could improve safety by requiring every pedestrian to wear helmets and by requiring all cars to have  rubber bumpers designed to deflect objects away from the vehicle, but at some point you have to simply accept that traffic deaths will happen at some level and that the correct course of action is to take reasonable steps to reduce them by as much as is practical while still considering the other needs of the city."
Austin,3drtm6,granolaatx,2,Sun Jul 19 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"They're not going to get anything done if people remain vigilant and demand cohesive and high-quality solutions that benefit multiple modes of travel.  The city continues to conduct ""improvements"" (Lavaca & 3rd is a good example) that do not use consistent design elements or incorporate best practices.  If planning advocates aren't holding the city accountable for its continued waste of taxpayer dollars on failed or archaic projects, they have no legitimacy."

I have a great time, and it's free to play! There is a DJ that calls the numbers out between the music, and I'll be there with some work friends. I have a hard time making friends as well, so I totally get it. Other than the people I see at work its hard being in a new city w/ out your fall back crew around."

Austin,3ds5wr,ahhter,4,Sun Jul 19 02:32:21 2015 UTC,These events aren't illegal but they tend to attract a lot of short-sighted people who do stupid shit and don't know where to draw the line.  Most automotive racers stay well away from these sorts of events and stick with legal tracks.
Austin,3ds5wr,sxzxnnx,3,Sun Jul 19 20:30:11 2015 UTC,He is probably worried about the family trying to pin liability for the accident on him or the club.

Austin,3ds5wr,mattbuford,2,Sun Jul 19 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"I can hear engines roaring from Lime Creek Road as I type this, and pretty much every weekend with good weather has many car groups doing that same drive.  However, the spot where this happened (Anderson Mill) is straight and easy.  It's pretty unlikely for an accident to happen there unless someone was just screwing around."

An off duty firefighter performed cpr as one of the first responders at the scene, and quite a few people did what they could to help, including putting out the fire.  Witnesses reported he was going extremely fast, 80+ in a 45 mph zone before going off the right shoulder and losing control crossing back into the tree lined median.  Someone has placed flowers at the scene this afternoon.  Prayers for the drivers family."

Austin,3ds5wr,FitzDizzyspells,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"Did it seem like he was racing, or anything like that? I haven't seen anyone, on Reddit or otherwise, confirm that this was related to this ""car cruise"" event."
Austin,3ds5wr,compta5,3,Sun Jul 19 19:44:45 2015 UTC,"Nope he wasn't racing. He was part of the cruise. From what I heard from one of the guys is that there is a gopro video that captures the whole crash. He was alone , gunned the throttle and just lost control. No racing involved."
Austin,3ds5wr,autobahn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"It was related to the cruise in that the driver was participating in the cruise. However, the majority of the cruise participants were more or less following the posted speeds on that road. A few of the drivers took it upon themselves to act stupid."
Austin,3ds5wr,dreadredJ,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain this ""event "" to me ? Is it really just a bunch of cars driving in a line together? Like some kind of boring parade ( as if parades aren't already boring)?"
Austin,3ds5wr,autobahn,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:36 2015 UTC,"It's a fun parade. Cruises can just be a big drive with a lot of people, or fun drives on fun roads, whatever. Of course if you don't enjoy driving and cars you're not going to understand.   Just like some wouldn't understand why you'd pay money to go to a big convention center to play board games with your friends, or why you'd pay to go see companies show off things they're going to sell you later, or whatever."
Austin,3ds5wr,dreadredJ,2,Sun Jul 19 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"Well if you look at the video, /u/longboardluv posted they are some pretty high performance cars.  Lime Creek road is a fun drive with a lot of twists and turns.  I suspect the cars were not driving it @ the speed of a parade."
Austin,3ds5wr,longboardluv,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"I did watch the video and while there were some nice sports cars out there ( not much of a car guy here , almost everything made in the past 2 decades looks like a safety bubble to me) there were a few staition wagons in there at the end. Is the point just to go on a nice ride with a bunch of other cars? The video title used the word ""accelerations"" and it seems like they all were gunning it after turning that corner. Assuming that's a public street , is this legal? Seems a few of those cars were sliding out before they accelerated. I guess I figured that sort of thing was more suited for a closed track.   Not trying to put down the car enthusiasts or make light of the fatality , just trying to understand what this is all about."
Austin,3ds5wr,Slypenslyde,3,Sun Jul 19 01:03:14 2015 UTC,It's a car cruise! What's so hard to understand?
Austin,3ds5wr,dreadredJ,10,Sun Jul 19 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of things, really. It could mean ""a leisurely drive down a scenic road"". It could mean ""a euphemism for drag racing cars on public roads."" It could mean ""there's a big-ass ferry boat taking cars on a vacation to the Bahamas"". I'm having a real hard time understanding how ""car cruise"" turned into ""someone ramming his face into a steering wheel at 80mph in a great demonstration of inertia"". Could you explain it for one of us dumbasses? I had to get my mom to type this for me."
Austin,3ds5wr,BaldassAntenna,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I've never heard of such a thing before. Seems weird to me , the way people bitch about traffic in this town , that anyone would want to drive in a long line of cars. Going on a nice drive on a curvy road with nice views is great , just seems odd to make it a group event. But hey I've got a normal sized dick , what do I know about owning a fast expensive car."
Austin,3ds5wr,longboardluv,-2,Sun Jul 19 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"It's a car cruise!   Yeah...that's a euphemism in this context.  Ever look up the definition of ""cruise""?  From Google:  2). (of a motor vehicle or aircraft) travel smoothly at a moderate or economical speed.  From what I saw in the video and what happened to this guy, they should probably re-think what they're calling their event."

Austin,3drb84,Bayou13,15,Sun Jul 19 00:42:35 2015 UTC,Most bakeries have a bunch of cupcakes on hand- you could possibly go that route. And then you could have multiple flavors which is kind of fun. I know wedding cupcakes have been a recent trend.
Austin,3drb84,clairrific,13,Sat Jul 18 18:43:28 2015 UTC,Possibly Buenos Aires Cafe. The owner is all about baking deserts more than anything else. Their cakes are delicious and nicely decorated. It's possible they could do a little more and make it more wedding like.  512-441-9000  Good luck!

Austin,3ds45t,bikegrrrrl,17,Sat Jul 18 22:44:15 2015 UTC,"Landlord here.  I use Cozy to create the application and do not check the boxes to require a credit check or background check.  I put the URL for the application in my ad and anyone can fill one out for free.  I go through the applications and select the ones that might qualify, those are the people I set up a viewing with.  The people who like the place and want to move forward, I go to their application on Cozy and request a credit and background check that they pay for.  They are 19.95 each.  I do these one applicant at a time in the order of most qualified to the least.  That way people don't have to throw fees and checks at a place they may not get.  You can also use the site to collect rent and deposits.  The lease I use is the standard Texas Residential Lease and I also create or download addendums like the mold addendum, smoking, parking, pets, pests, etc.  and have the qualifying tenant sign those as well."
Austin,3ds45t,monarchatx,2,Sat Jul 18 23:09:42 2015 UTC,THANK YOU! Huge help. I appreciate it! I figured there would be a web-based something to cut out a bunch of paper. Last lease I signed was some whited-out mess.
Austin,3ds45t,BeigiBlork,0,Sat Jul 18 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"Are you aware that the Texas Property Code requires certain notices to appear in a residential lease? Do you know what can and cannot be deducted from a security deposit? How about the security devices and smoke alarm requirements? What is your level of knowledge regarding ""conditions materially affecting the physical health or safety of the ordinary tenant""?  I ask because each of those could potentially be a lawsuit. Tenant's rights attorneys take these cases because if they win, the landlord pays the attorney's fees. Plus there is a nice, fat, non-exempt asset to seize if the landlord doesn't want to pay a judgment.  At the very least, read Chapter 92 of the Texas Property Code. http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm"

I'm a homeowner looking to start renting on my own soon too as I've only had terrible experiences with Austin property management companies in the past. Where do you post your ads/listings?

Austin,3ds45t,throwaway_29402040,4,Sun Jul 19 10:41:26 2015 UTC,"Landlord here... I use a realtor to find a tenant and Cozy.co to collect the rent. For ~80% of one month's rent, they list it on the local MLS and screen tenants for you. This is the hardest part of the entire process and its worth every penny. Additionally, the fee is tax deductible. Also, be sure you have a good handy man's number on file. Its inevitable that as soon as you are on vacation or having a rough day at work, something is going to break at that house and you may not be able to head over and fix it."
Austin,3ds45t,atx1687,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:02:06 2015 UTC,That's a good idea. In the past I was charged the 80% plus 5-7% per month for what was essentially just collecting rent and sending it my way.
Austin,3ds45t,throwaway_29402040,4,Sun Jul 19 11:06:29 2015 UTC,"One last thing, a tenant with great credit & a great job is a great find but in my experience, they will be gone at the end of the lease because they will have bought their own place.   Given a choice, I go for the people with a blemish or two and who are working on righting the ship. They will typically pay the rent ad stick around for a while."
Austin,3ds45t,monarchatx,2,Sun Jul 19 11:05:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Given the property that I'm leasing, I think most of my potential tenants will fall under the ""righting the ship"" category!"
Austin,3ds45t,Jakefrmstatepharm,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I am doing this for them because the realtor they used got them a really lousy last tenant, and pressured them to accept the guy.

Austin,3ds45t,Jakefrmstatepharm,2,Sun Jul 19 17:11:24 2015 UTC,Rule #1 for renting a place in Austin is to ask at least $300-$500 more than the place is actually worth.
Austin,3ds45t,monarchatx,3,Sun Jul 19 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"Landlord here.  An apartment is worth what people are wiling to pay for it.  It's called a ""market""."

Austin,3ds45t,ATXNYCESQ,3,Sun Jul 19 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"Don't blame the landlords, blame the fact that our property taxes force us to raise the rent.

Austin,3ds45t,atxanon,-4,Sun Jul 19 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"You and I both know that there are most definitely people like yourself who are honest landlords, you aren't in it to screw people and make a bunch of money, you probably respond to maintenance issues quickly, and most likely have a good relationship with your tenants. Unfortunately, you only make up about 10-20% of landlords/property managers. The other types are the ones who have the attitude of ""this is Austin and people will pay a shitload of money for a place like this... Aaaaand also they're gonna stay no matter what so these maintenance issues can slide"". Its a sad thing when this starts happening.

Your goal is to get a ton of interested people and be able to be choosy in who your tenants are.  Everyone has their own philosophy, but IMO a common mistake of landlords is to focus too much on squeezing out the highest rent they think they possibly can, and either 1.) the property sits on the market for a long time (if it takes you a month to find 12 month lease, that's the equivalent of taking a 7.7% cut on your gross income on the property over 13 months), or 2.) end up renting to someone who isn't really qualified and get hosed when the person has to break the lease/ be evicted/ is consistently late or problematic making payments.  DON'T charge too much under market, which is a clear signal that you don't respect the property (so why should the tenants), but a far more common mistake is stepping over a dollar to try to pick up a nickel (so to speak)."
Austin,3ds45t,atx1687,0,Sun Jul 19 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"I concur.  I always rent mine under market. I get more interest therefore have more choices.  It rents almost immediately saving me downtime and lost income.  Tenants are less likely to want to bail after a year causing me to have to do a shit ton of work to clean, repair and then it over again. I'll take up to a 10% hit to avoid annual turnovers."

Though I can't answer your background check question, the law requires you to have a standard lease format in Texas.   Also if you plan to rent, make sure you are licensed/insured to do so. Too many people are renting now that don't have the license/insurance. If something ever happens it will be your (or int this case the owners ass) that gets sued."

Austin,3ds45t,BEYAH,2,Sat Jul 18 23:04:30 2015 UTC,Double check that they have the right type of insurance policy. A regular homeowners policy won't apply once you rent the place. You need a landlord policy and they are usually a little more expensive.   I've never heard of needing a license to be a landlord.

Austin,3ds45t,imdarealslimshady,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:57 2015 UTC,No. If you have landlord's insurance on the house you are good. It might also be worthwhile to require your tenants to get renters' insurance or sign an acknowledgement that the landlord's insurance does not cover their belongings in case something goes wrong.

That said, she miscarried, and that's sad, whatever the cause.   That said, it's not clear that the bus incident was the cause, or even if it was, that Capital Metro should be held responsible.  I guess that's for the doctors and courts to decide."
Austin,3dqm0n,KUweatherman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:04 2015 UTC,"Or she, you know, shouldn't have been banging on the side of a moving vehicle. Sucks she lost her baby, but the fault is her own."
Austin,3dqm0n,dougmc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, she certainly caused the problem, though it's also possible that the courts may find that Capital Metro was responsible for her injury.  (If there was an injury ... more on that in a bit.)  Though they'd have to both 1) find that CM was more than 50% responsible for it, and 2) find that the injury caused her miscarriage.  #1 seems unlikely, and #2 seems even more unlikely if it happened a month later and even more unlikely if she wasn't actually injured in the first place (and there's no mention of any injuries.  It would be hard to injure her unborn child and yet not injure her.)  Technically, if the bus was driving away with her banging on the side, Austin's ""vulnerable road user"" law was being violated, as the bus would be passing her at less than 6'.  Unless she was violating the law by doing that (the ordinance has a big loophole for that -- if the vulnerable user is violating a law, that's an affirmative defense), the ordinance doesn't really care if she moved close to the bus (which is clearly what happened) or the bus moved close to her.  Either way, based on what I know of this ... it sounds like she should receive nothing from CM.  They might give her a little to make her go away, which seems wrong but might be cheaper for them than actually going to court."

I had no option but to hit it.  I didn't even have the reaction time to know I was hitting it until it was rolling up my windshield.  I'm not going to drive slower because of that.  There's no reason to drive 25 or 20 when the speed limit is 30 in a neighborhood, just because of the one possible chance a deer might fuck up my day, because odds are, the speed I'm driving at will make little to no difference."

Apartment prices in Austin have skyrocketed in recent years. Try Corazon, anything on Riverside, if you want close to town. Stay away from Georgetown, Round Rock, Leander, Pflugerville, and Cedar Park. You'll miss the Austin experience because you won't be in Austin. Traffic is less hectic if you travel primarily east and west rather than north and south, so east side and west side are desirable, but the east side is ""up and coming"" while the west side done already came and went...it's probably too expensive.

You're going to want to branch out and see if you know anyone in the area (connection via friends, etc) that you can crash with, or try to convince someone on Craigslist or something to let you stay without secured income.   Edit -  Re-read your post, sounds like you're in your last year of school? If you can secure an offer before coming here and get an offer letter to show income to prospective living places, that will help a lot.  Standard here is you pay one month's rent as a security deposit. It may be 1.5 to 2 months worth for you since you've got no local rental history or credit. So, save that up, save first month rent to get in with (so between 2-3 months of rent cost).. and you should be okay."

The newest incident happened when he was asked to retrieve a gun that was left at the shooting range by a coworker.  Instead of getting the gun and returning it, he decided to take it to a gun shop and ask the workers how to manipulate it.   The firing pin was removed and the sights were adjusted.  The gun was then returned to the coworker who had to take it out of service due to the adjustments made.     This guy could be the nicest guy in the world but what he did was extremely dangerous.  He should not be allowed to be around weapons especially not in a law enforcement capacity if he thinks making a police officer's weapon unsafe is the right thing to do in any situation.

True, /r/austin's 2015 cobra scare began with a tragic death, but it quickly became about the lethally poisonous snake, loose somewhere in town. Every joke I saw was about that, the lethally poisonous snake, loose somewhere in town. That's a totally valid conscious or unconscious fear, it comes with being a mammal, and when people encounter fears over which they have no control, they make jokes, or upvote them. Trying to shame people into just being afraid, without joking, because a person has already died from the lethally poisonous snake, loose somewhere in town, is a) foreseeably ineffective, and b) unsympathetic."

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

If they endanger themselves then they are the ones who have to pay but usually their risky behavior involves others who would not choose to accept that same risk. And that's not cool.

Why did they let their kid have an illegal highly venomous snake as a pet in the first place? It's not like someone painted a cobra like a python and tricked him into buying it. And why did he have it out in a public place? If anything the family should be apologizing for letting their ignorant son endanger the lives of innocent people. What if the snake didn't get killed and bit some kid at the nearby school? Would you feel bad for the original family then? Or pissed alongside the newly innocent grieving family? I'm not going to feel bad about joking about the snake, because in reality, that kid died of his and his family's negligence."

Austin,3dlaew,justanotherfister,8,Fri Jul 17 13:30:57 2015 UTC,I can't make light of the situation either. 18 year old kid that loved animals is killed in a parking lot by being a little too cavalier. That's way too young to be entrusted with an apex predator. The whole thing is sad.
Austin,3dlaew,ThePoopyButt,-8,Fri Jul 17 14:05:21 2015 UTC,Another thing that sucks is that its very possible that he has friends and family that are grieving and are seeing all these inconsiderate posts on Reddit and other social media sources.

Yes, it's sad that a young kid died. Also, it's hilarious that a snake was loose and caused so much panic. They are only temporally connected. If you can't separate the two concepts, I'm sorry.

Austin,3dnv25,Bury_Me_In_Smoke,8,Fri Jul 17 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"I witnessed a poor girl getting hit on the crosswalk of MLK and Guadalupe St several months ago.  I was waiting in the left lane of MLK with several other cars heading west and the right lane was clear of any cars.  A woman ( early 20s) started walking at the intersection of MLK and Guadalupe heading north towards the dominos around 11:30 pm.  About 1/4th of the way into her crossing,  the crosswalk hand stop flashing.  Without looking left or right, she picked up the pace.  At the same time the light on MLK turned green, a car in the right lane came over the hill and hit the girl flipping her in the air (My car and several others in the left lane was blocking the car's view to see the girl)  She landed very hard on the cement. Happened so fast. I'm always careful and never speed because people jaywalk all the time on that section of MLK. Of course she wasn't jaywalking, but all around bad scene.  I still do not know if she made it or not."

Austin,3dnv25,encodingpixels,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"Of course she wasn't jaywalking, but all around bad scene. I still do not know if she made it or not.   When did she enter the intersection? Was the walk sign on? If the hand stopped flashing 1/4th of the way into her crossing, she probably didn't enter when the walk sign was on. I agree that drivers should keep eyes out for walkers, but this sounds like a case of jaywalking.  From Wikipedia:   Jaywalking occurs when a pedestrian crosses a roadway where regulations do not permit doing so. Examples include a pedestrian crossing between intersections without yielding to drivers and starting to cross a crosswalk at a signalized intersection without waiting for a permissive indication to be displayed."
Austin,3dnv25,iliveintexas,2,Sat Jul 18 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"It's crazy the degree to which our cities and laws have been built around cars. ""Jaywalking"" was a term invented by car manufacturers to stigmatize what was, at that point, the perfectly normal act of walking in a city street.  Now you can literally get killed for doing it, and it will be considered your fault."
Austin,3dnv25,foxedendpapers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Cities are made up of different elements all interacting with one another: pedestrians, cars, trains, cyclists, boats--all trying to safely move about.  I'm all for building infrastructure to support walkers and cyclists, including car-free zone that separate cars from other travellers, but busy streets like this one are designed for car traffic. I'm very familiar with MLK & Guadalupe; that is an intersection with very heavy traffic. Stop signs and crosswalks are designed elements to give pedestrians have an opportunity to cross it safely, but pedestrians must be expected to follow the signals meant for them.  It's not the fault of the other party if someone disregards safety signals meant for them."
Austin,3dnv25,iliveintexas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying it was necessarily the fault of the motorist, though I'm pretty sure under Texas law a motorist does have a responsibility to watch for pedestrians in the crosswalk, regardless of when the pedestrian entered the crosswalk.  I was just pointing out how disproportionately city infrastructure in the US prioritizes cars. A huge percent of urban real estate is dedicated to just providing enough room for the massive vehicles to get around, and all that space is pretty much useless for anything else."

But really, just like anything else, when you have large pieces of metal traveling at high speeds, you likely will have deaths associated with it.  It is just part of life now.  How can we make them lower?  Ban cars?  Won't happen.  Ban cell phones?  People will still use them.  Ban jaywalking?  People still do it.  Ban drunk driving?  Hasn't worked."
Austin,3dnv25,defroach84,9,Fri Jul 17 21:51:42 2015 UTC,"Force cars to travel at safer speeds? We can do that, through ""traffic calming"" measures like traffic circles and speed bumps. Lessen the number of cars on the road? We can do that too, though the proven combination of congestion pricing and alternative infrastructure (like, say, a light rail).  Actually having sidewalks on all city streets would probably help, too."
Austin,3dnv25,foxedendpapers,-5,Sat Jul 18 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"Roundabouts/traffic circles do little to slow down cars.  Having grown up in a place with them everywhere, it does not really do that at all.  Speed bumps?  I am all for in some situations, but would be terrible for congestion all through the city.  Pretty much, all they would do is cause more traffic.  We do need light rail.  But, we have seen how that has worked out."
Austin,3dnv25,defroach84,6,Sat Jul 18 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"The only way to address congestion in a growing city is by making alternatives to driving more appealing than driving. Slowing cars down with speed bumps and traffic circles (which do slow cars down) would make pedestrians and other road users safer, and would be a good first step in addressing congestion (followed with improving public transit)."
Austin,3dnv25,foxedendpapers,-7,Sat Jul 18 04:12:21 2015 UTC,How would it make things less congested? You just replace a car on the road with more people walking.  People who take longer to get home and just crowd side walks.  It just moves the congestion at the pain of other things.

I'm guessing I never get 'caught' because I don't do it with a very large group of people that drink in public every day. And because I truly never bother anybody.   You seem to be very salty on the issue so I'm curious as to what made you this way.   See above.   Seriously if people go, not to get wasted but just to enjoy a couple beers, not bother anybody, and make sure to clean up after themselves, why are you so mad about it?   See above.   And the cops who spend so much time and energy dealing with people with open containers, what is it they are doing exactly?   You answered your own question there.   What is it they are preventing?   Just a guess, but I'll go with preventing small transgressions from becoming big transgressions.   How many people are getting arrested for theft? How many people are getting arrested for public intoxication? Assault? Rape? How many people are just getting tickets for open containers?   I don't care enough to look up the stats for you, but they are definitely available to the public. You have much energy for this topic. Maybe direct some of it to answering those questions for yourself.   I'm willing to bet that every person that police deal with at the greenbelt is only just open containers. Not even littering.   Again, I don't have the stats, but I guarantee you that statement is incorrect. I'm willing to bet anything on that.  You seem to have a problem with police enforcing laws you disagree with. That is usually a waste of time and energy. If you care enough, and if you can find others of like mind, you should get those laws changed. Even if you only get the interpretation or consequence altered.  FWIW, if you intend to go in that direction, you will find few voters anywhere that will endorse laws allowing a very large group of people drinking in public every day. Your presentation will need massaging."
Austin,3drroz,elphabaisfae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:12 2015 UTC,I think you're also making false assumptions.  It seems you're thinking that there's like 20 people having a frat party over there or something which is very far from the truth. Each day there's like 5-10 or so people more or less.  The group is much larger than that but not everybody goes every day.   And if you also bring beer to the greenbelt  (probably the same amount that I do) then why are you arguing with me right now? Why are you giving me so much shit when you're doing the same thing that I'm doing? I throw away my trash. What is your problem? Why are you spending so much time out of your day to argue with me?
Austin,3drroz,TequilaChimney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:46 2015 UTC,And do you pack a designated driver as well?
Austin,3drroz,achay,3,Sun Jul 19 12:57:13 2015 UTC,Well it's not like we're getting wasted at the greenbelt. Just bring a couple beers to sip on and relax and stay until the sun goes down.  Nobody is too intoxicated to drive and if they are they are not driving.
Austin,3drroz,throwawayloginname,0,Sun Jul 19 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. But even the people who were obeying the law felt the need to leave once the boys in blue started doing their jobs."

Because I did just that a few weeks ago and wasn't accosted by anyone in blue."
Austin,3drroz,DrTung,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the moral of the story is that if you're not being sloppy drunk, endangering people, or littering then you'll be fine.

Austin,3dnh7k,therakel749,2,Sat Jul 18 00:39:46 2015 UTC,"Postmates is literally awful. You will make about $6 an hour and it's a huge hassle.   Edit- customer service never calls in the order ahead of time like they are supposed to, so you have to drive to the place, find parking,, order, wait, drive to the apartment, again find parking, find the unit number all within an hour. Most orders are $4.00 orders and you may get a buck or two for a tip.   It's almost impossible to do more than one order per hour. The specials they run are AWFUL. No matter where you are in the city you will have to go to one specific place to get someone their free kolache or whatever. And they will be sold out of what the person wants. So you have to contact them, and there is no reaponse, and the clock is ticking because you only have an hour to get it to them.   Parking is really the worst part. Have you tried to find convenient parking 20 times a day/ night? It doesn't happen."
Austin,3dnh7k,llikeafoxx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"Regarding delivery jobs, Tiff's Treats ain't bad. Drivers get $8 hourly, plus a delivery fee, and you keep 100% of the tip. They offer benefits, and even a 401k plan if that's your thing. There are so many stores in Austin that it's pretty easy to drop, swap, and pick up shifts, and setting your own schedule and getting time off was never an issue for me. I would advise against working in Central, for the same reason everyone else that has to deal with students has said. But delivering in Westlake, South / North Austin, and Round Rock was all pretty solid. Pretty reasonable interim job."
Austin,3dnh7k,EchoAstral,0,Sat Jul 18 04:28:00 2015 UTC,"Favor is okay. It used to be great, now it's just okay. I used my car for Favor, so I can't speak to what it's like for cyclists. If your primary AO is the Guadalupe/Drag/Campus area, be prepared to make no tips. Students should not be allowed to use Favor IMO simply because of this. I've busted my ass to get someone their highly specific study-break tacos on the other side of town only to get $2.50 as my tip so many times I've lost count. Really frustrating. Might be a little different considering school's out, but I wouldn't hold your breath. Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions about Favor."
Austin,3dnh7k,Texas2904,4,Fri Jul 17 22:29:13 2015 UTC,How are you paid overall?   I've always wondered why getting 2 tacos delivered warrants $10 in delivery fees plus a $5 tip.  Are you getting an hourly wage or just tips?
Austin,3dnh7k,EchoAstral,2,Fri Jul 17 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"Favor guarantees at least $9/hr for every runner per shift. So if I work for a four hour shift and my tips add up only to $28, Favor will ""top-up"" the necessary $8 it takes to reach the guaranteed $36. On busy weekends and late nights, they would raise the hourly guarantee of $9 to $12, $14, sometimes $20 per hour to incentivize if it got really busy. As per charging, it's a flat $5 fee per favor, plus tip to the driver, whatever you choose for that to be. The cost of getting a bucket of fried chicken and a drink from your favorite food stand can get pretty damn expensive if you tip well and have the disposable income to do so. That's why the most reliable customers are time-crunched yuppies living in the hastily-erected condos off South Lamar and the east side."

Austin,3dkf4y,pavlovs_log,13,Fri Jul 17 03:19:50 2015 UTC,Yup. There's more than enough parking at The Triangle even during their peak times on the weekend. Just park at the garage on 46th by Chase and walk a few extra feet.

Maybe I'm misreading your tone, but you seem like you're taking this a bit personally.   And everyone makes dumb mistakes sometimes, including me.

The hiring process of police officers can over a year long in most cases, with background checks, polygraphs and oral boards, followed by an academy after they're hired and already on the payroll, an eighth month academy in Austin's case.   Basically it's very expensive to hire and train a police officer, so they're less likely to let them go over a small number mistakes.

Austin,3dl1fp,Beeeeeeedy,26,Fri Jul 17 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"I've lived with 6 people in a big house before.  You get to enjoy everyone's little problems.  One guy slowly build a pile of socks buy taking them off, piling them up in the corner of the TV room when he got back from school.     Another guy gave us all foot fungus (shared showers) because he liked to 'walk around without shoes every where he went' (hint: that's gives you fungus, and your roomies too - fucking a-hole, I still have that shit).   The kitchen sink is constantly full of dishes.  The food in the fridge?  Yep, you may have bought it, but it was eaten by someone that no-body seems to know.  You'll need a 'bathroom basket' to take with you every time you go to the bathroom for a poop, shower, toothbrush.   For example, a large bottle of shampoo left in the bathroom lasts about 3 days (because after all, you left there for everyone to use).   Even bring your own toilet paper, because no-body else buys it, and what you buy, is there's and lasts 1 day.  You want to sleep at night on a worknight?  Oh no, we can't have that...  Your roomies will come in at all hours of the night, and it makes perfect since to play music very loudly until 5am.  Then you have the roomie that things it's okay to have 3 friends of theres stay in the one bedroom that they rent.   TV?  Forget it.  No control of it at all.   Then, there's the one guy that thinks everyone should leave for the evening so he can have a nice romantic dinner in the house alone with his girlfriend.   fucking jerk he was.  And then the roomie with a dog that he thinks it's 'cute' that the dog jumps up on table to 'eat like a human' (but it was your dinner that he ate).  And then the utilities.  One guy hasn't paid his share in 4 months, so you want him to pay 300, and he refuses because 'no-way' has he racked up that much.  About the utilities, you try to conserve on energy, but every time you walk through the house, every single light in the house in constantly on.   And then there is the roomie that thinks, cleaning the floor, means to rip up all the oak wood flooring and 'paint the cement'.   Getting up for work at 6am to get your laundry out of the dryer?  Yep, the room right next to it has a naked tattooed chick sprawled out on the bed, completely naked.  (probably a good thing though - for a guy anyway).   Beer cans, beer cans, beers cans EVERYWHERE!   So, yes, lets 'bag them up for recycle'.  But, now you have about 30 bags of beer cans in your back yard and the smell is horrible.   And then the 'can I borrow some money?', and never get it back."

If I understand this situation correctly, this guy had family/friends there and was staying with them.  Which means he might not have been in the safer tourist area.    As long as I've been visiting Mexico the rule was always to stay in the touristy city areas unless you're going on a big tour to a place like Chichen Itza.  Never strike out on your own.  You go outside the main areas of places like Cancun or Puerto Vallarta and you can quickly find yourself in pretty shady locations."

It's easy to assume he's the aggressor. It's also convenient to claim rape when busted by dad.     Now before everyone goes ape shit calling me an MRA, etc. I'm just providing an alternative POV, devil's advocate if you will. I know if I were messing around with a girl and her dad walked in (when I was in my teens), I'd be scared and might run in that situation, doubly so if she decided to throw me under the bus. It's reported that the warrant says he lied about his age, but doesn't mention any hard proof. If it was just to watch movies, why have him park down the street? Why would she need to hide having a friend over for that?     Facts:     She invited him over   Dad walked in on them   He ran   He came back for his vehicle, asked for a lawyer.      Allegations:     He lied about his age   He forced himself on her for sex      If it's as she says, then I hope he gets all due punishment. But let's not forget innocent until proven guilty, and have a bit more ability for critical thinking instead of swallowing a very slanted ""news"" report in entirety.     Edit: Excuse me while I wrestle with formatting."
Austin,3dimwl,Krynnyth,9,Thu Jul 16 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"I mean in this case.. he (probably) knew she was younger, and he knows his own age, so isn't he on the hook anyway?"
Austin,3dimwl,greatkingdoctor,4,Thu Jul 16 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a year too old. It's statutory."
Austin,3dimwl,Red_Chaos1,-5,Fri Jul 17 00:48:46 2015 UTC,That can depend on a lot of things.
Austin,3dimwl,phd_student_doom,4,Thu Jul 16 18:20:36 2015 UTC,Age of consent is 17. So if he was engaged in any 'adult' act he should be charged.
Austin,3dimwl,Red_Chaos1,3,Thu Jul 16 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"Going by the letter of the law, you're probably right. However, depending on what is found from investigation, it may go any number of ways. What if it turns out that in reality the two were secretly seeing each other for quite awhile. Judges have given very lenient sentences, or even dismissed charges in such cases.  We can only wait to see what the facts are and how things play out based on that. Personally I don't think being 1 year over some subjective line is worth enough to turn a person into a sex offender for life. But if he was in fact forcing himself on her, or trying, then as I said before he deserves the stricter punishment. Even then though I'm not sure a lifetime labeling as a sex offender would be fair. Unless it was found he had previous record of sexual abuse against others."
Austin,3dimwl,phd_student_doom,5,Thu Jul 16 20:57:49 2015 UTC,Agreed with all your points.   Luckily the courts will be able to read the IG messages and decided if they were in fact secret lovers or met that very day.

Austin,3dimwl,welcomebear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"A ""hill to die on"" is a saying that might be more clearly phrased as ""something worth defending to the death."" As in, a strategic position or valuable resource or ideal that you would be willing to defend, possibly at huge personal cost for some greater purpose.  It's usually phrased as something like ""is this really the hill you want die on? You should just let your manager make grammatical mistakes instead of correcting him.""    So when he says ""some people pick strange hills to die on,"" he's jokingly saying that the commenter is going to be down voted into oblivion and remarking that some people choose strange battles in life.

After almost stepping on the damn thing, it jumps up into its cobra stance, I begin some weird, spastic dance trying to get away, the whole time, in baffling wonderment as to just what the fuck is a cobra doing in southeast Texas.  When my curiosity began to take over and my heart rate slowed some, I went back over to see this cobra, and saw it was a hog nose and was in awe of it for being clever. Of course, 14yo me had to mess with it, then it started playing dead, I mess with it some more and it vomited and gave off a stench that quelled any desire to mess with it further."

Austin,3dgr00,FigMcLargeHuge,4,Thu Jul 16 13:52:35 2015 UTC,I hope they are being very careful with the car.  My friend lost a snake inside his car for more than a month.  It had crawled up into the dashboard and then into the frame of the car.
Austin,3dgr00,xrisnothing,4,Thu Jul 16 14:55:48 2015 UTC,If my wife even hears your story she is going to lose it. She was trying to calculate how far the Lowes on I35 and Rundberg is from our house to see how long it would take it to get here. I was laughing the entire time. For the record it is probably 40+ miles hence the uncontrollable laughter. If she thought that there could ever be the possibility of a snake hidden in her dashboard I would probably have to dismantle the car at her request.

The owners have been friendly and encouraged us to call if there are any problems.  I think STRs are fine as long as the city keeps it such that at most 5% of homes in a neighborhood can be licensed.

Austin,3dmds1,Thefakephotographer,4,Fri Jul 17 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"I would sub Barton Springs for Hamilton Pool for a few reasons: 1) Sometimes Hamilton Pool is closed for swimming, 2) Hamilton Pool can hit max capacity pretty early, 3) It's pretty far out of the way if you plan on doing the other things on your list.  Here's what I would do that incorporates most of what you are looking for:   If you can be at Bacon before or close to their opening time (9a weekends, 11a weekdays - you could flip #1 and #2 if it's a weekday), start here for breakfast. The biscuits & gravy and chicken & waffles are my favorite items on the menu. If not Bacon isn't your thing, 24 Diner is also a great option. Walk over to Hope Outdoor Gallery (aka the Graffiti Park) and explore. Walk, run or bike the Butler Trail. The 5k loop (3.1 mile trail) is nice. If you park by Zilker Park, you'll be in a good spot to walk over to Barton Springs. Cool off at Barton Springs. $4 cash to get in and they have large showers/changing areas for you to use. For lunch, walk over to The Picnic food truck park. Great options here, but my top two are Turf n Surf (website is for the other location, but menu is the same) and The Mighty Cone. Really can't go wrong with any of the trailers here, though. Relax at Zilker Park or go back to Barton Springs (get a stamp when you leave for free re-entry) for more swimming/napping. Head out to Mount Bonnell or Pennybacker Bridge for views. 360 (Capital of Texas Highway) is very scenic, but traffic can be bad, so try to avoid peak hours. For dinner with a view, Hula Hut is better than the Oasis and easier to get to than Ski Shores. It's not the very best Tex-mex, but it's my go-to place on the lake. Go see the bat colony from the Congress Bridge or book a Bat Cruise. Head back into town and people watch on 6th street or use Do 512 to find a show to see.   Have fun!"

I would advise against Hamilton Pool as it gets crowded quickly and from what I've heard the bacteria count is still too high to swim.  BBQ: Stileswitch  Tacos: Torchy's  After that it really just depends on what you're into.

Also may want to check with SLVS, look them up on facebook, we have a registry as well and they have a team of individuals who do weekly pawnshop crawls and what not.  They have a higher recovery rate than APD by far.  If you haven't registered but have the serial do it ASAP.  If you don't have the serial try and find it, or you're pretty much SOL.

For a 6, they'll charge about $100 to replace it, and it will be the legit Apple screen. With this place I paid around $150 (had it back in 40min), and have this slightly off screen that Apple provides to all other places to repair phones with."
Austin,3dgwi6,fozzyfreakingbear,2,Thu Jul 16 06:23:43 2015 UTC,$109 to be exact. I had the screen on my 6 repaired at the Apple retail store. If you have an older phone it's definitely a better deal to go to onsite cellular or another repair place.   Newer phones are about the same for a 3rd party screen vs the real deal at Apple retail. The viewing angles are awful on the 3rd party screens too.

I don't have a recommendation for you but rather a story of warning. I used to work at BestBuy mobile and one time I had a couple come on to upgrade their phone. They also planned on trading in their old phone for credit (pretty basic story). However, once I started the trade in process and was getting information off the physical phone itself, things started getting strange. After taking the battery cover off and out I noticed this Galaxy S 3 was not like the others. I started asking the couple questions and turns out they had recently went to one of these repair shops to have a screen replaced. What happened was this shop straight up swapped out their real phone with a counterfeit, then just cloned the real phone onto the fake one. I didn't believe it but to this day I'm pretty sure that's what happened. So you know... Buyer beware"
Austin,3dgwi6,DillyWhompa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:40:44 2015 UTC,I'd go to Apple to make you get a real Apple part.  3rd party parts are pretty crappy usually for iPhones and some times counterfeit and don't perform as good as an Apple OEM part.

Austin,3dd2rv,jordanmc109,2,Wed Jul 15 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"I have never flown outside of the country before. When I went to look at prices, they were all $1200+. Where did you find the $770?"
Austin,3dd2rv,HoratioRastapopulous,5,Wed Jul 15 18:41:32 2015 UTC,My bad! $770 was Frankfurt to Austin. Found Austin-Frankfurt roundtrip for $900-$970.
Austin,3dd2rv,maracle6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"Still, that's good.  Considering you can hop on a cheap inter-European airline or a train once you're there, this will making getting to Europe a lot easier."
Austin,3dd2rv,YourOnlyVato,2,Thu Jul 16 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"Anyone ever flown this carrier before?  What's the flight experience, seats, etc like?  That is a nice price."

Austin,3dd2rv,pogos-tick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"At this point I'd argue it's not necessary, since Austin is primarily an origin and destination airport, and only four of the five flights (Cancún, Cabo, Heathrow, and Frankfurt) are considered international arrivals because of CBP Pre Clearance at YYZ, I feel that the working hours are entirely sufficient. At this point I'm mostly concerned by space. There's a 7 gate expansion in the works but that's not slated to open until 2017."
Austin,3dd2rv,defroach84,2,Wed Jul 15 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"This one really confuses me. I don't see this flight being that popular solely based on the airline.  Hopefully, you can check bags through to further destinations and not have to recheck.  But I am happy to see this.  I just flew in on the London flight yesterday - so nice to skip the DFW layover."
Austin,3dd2rv,tatertotmonkey,5,Wed Jul 15 12:07:08 2015 UTC,"The airline may not be too popular, but considering Frankfurt is a great hub for transferring within europe, I'm sure many people will book with it!"
Austin,3dd2rv,defroach84,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"I agree.  But, as long as you do not need to recheck your bags onto another airline after you get to Frankfurt, I think it will work."
Austin,3dd2rv,mcnair99,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:36 2015 UTC,I'll certainly check it out.
Austin,3dd2rv,defroach84,2,Wed Jul 15 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"On another note, landing in Frankfurt at almost 2 PM seems a bit late for making connections.  I am used to planes landing early in the morning in Europe for that reason.  It may not be a big deal, and I am just overthinking it."
Austin,3dd2rv,LoudMusic,2,Wed Jul 15 14:16:31 2015 UTC,Plenty early assuming you don't need to travel onwards to India/Asia. Intra-Europe 2pm is plenty fine
Austin,3dd2rv,autobahn,2,Wed Jul 15 15:16:16 2015 UTC,Good to know - most of my onward flights in Europe are to Asia/Middle East/Far eastern Europe which may be where my experience comes from.

Usually, these kinds of rent-control policies result in the creation of slums (see: New York in the '80s) because it is more profitable to not maintain them. It also prevents the development of new construction.  Will be interesting to see how this plays out."

There are pretty much no neighborhoods comparable to say, the South Side or pre-gentrification Humboldt Park/Pilsen. If you live in Chicago rather than a suburb, typical Austinites' views on what constitute a dangerous/undesirable neighborhood are going to be very different than yours.  There are, however, a lot of places with basically nothing within walking distance if you chose to live outside of the 183/Mopac/71 ring. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in traffic if you chose to live far away from where you work, and to say goodbye to functional public transit."

Also shop's have a minimum fee, usually around $40-50 even if the tattoo takes a few seconds.

Austin,3ddk42,Punchcard,-9,Thu Jul 16 02:29:46 2015 UTC,"It is most likely not a ""government takeover"". However, it could be preparation for potential sweeping changes in gun control laws. Washington can't enforce that without being prepared, considering the ""come and take it"" aggressive mentality has been instilled within gun owners who might not own guns at all unless they had strong convictions about them. I've heard more than a few Texans say ""they'll have to take [my gun] from my cold dead hands"". However, any necessary shows of force allowed by the preparation of Jade Helm, the government would vastly reduce casualties in the case of potential sweeping gun control changes - which the left is obviously pushing for.  Edit: tough crowd, Jesus Christ. Maybe it's just general prep. Who knows - I don't and I'm not even slightly concerned. But, doesn't it make anyone wonder why only target open carry states in the south? Again, don't know, don't really care. But my best guess is above."

They have a free nacho bar during that time with free beans, beef, chicken (sometimes), queso, and chips.  A lot of people also enjoy County Line.  It's not the best BBQ, but Austin has very high standards.  They do have a pretty large selection of good sides and menu items that will probably appeal to almost everyone.  Honestly though, most of the ""Austiny"" restaurants are more centrally located and there's not much I can really recommend up that way.  There's just lots of chain restaurants up north and in Round Rock, but one of those might be good for your group."
Austin,3dgq21,monarchatx,3,Thu Jul 16 05:15:43 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to venture to central, Austin Land and Cattle has a great semi-private dining room. They have one of the best happy hours in town (and they pour heavy) which comes in handy when you're with family."

My brother and mother came home around 3 PM, and they were both sick by 8 PM. Everyone was throwing up, we couldn't keep anything down, and the cramps were absolutely awful.

Austin,3dgmce,WalkingPhoenix,5,Thu Jul 16 02:53:39 2015 UTC,there are a few issues in the 02 Xterra that will cause a random issue like that...   if the dash is lighting up like a Christmas tree I would start with the fuse block.... but you didnt say you got any CEL light so I would start with the fuel tank sending unit. the connection on the top of the tank will build up resistance (then heat) and the fuel pump will shut down. it should restart after it cools down but will fail again shortly when it gets hot. Check and see if it restarts when its cooled down.   keep us posted

It's really close to your car (assuming it's still in that parking lot) - it's right across Lamar from Half-Price Books.  http://bbmuffler.com/  They also have 4/5 stars on yelp if that matters.  Obviously getting multiple quotes would be best, but kind of hard when your car doesn't run. Not sure if you can start the Xterra again after it cools down, but maybe just drive it across Lamar and see what they quote you.  They have some pretty good mechanics (or at least they did 2 years ago when I moved away). They aren't the cheapest or anything, but I trust them to actually get it done right."

The dressing is pretty easy, although I can't remember a link to an exact recipe.  It's basically mayo, ketcup, a little relish, a little horseradish, dash of worcestershire, etc.  It will be better than anything you get out of the salad dressing aisle.  Kraut's not hard to make either."
Austin,3dganm,scroatmeal,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"As a person inspired by the pastrami at Pieous, I embarked upon a monthlong journey to make my own pastrami and lemme tell you it is well worth the moderate though spread out effort. We just finished the first 3 lb chunk of prime brisket Pastrami and I'm diving into the next chunk tonight for a potluck.   I worked off an online recipe ""just like Katz's"" and it is every bit as good as Pieous!   The nice part is it starts with an amazing corned beef, so if you skip the rub and smoke and go straight into a boiler you get amazeballs fixins for a proper Reuben."

Same difference, just pastrami instead of corned beef and coleslaw instead of kraut.   And, as was mentioned below - homemade kraut is super easy and allows you control over the ""strength"" - depending on the ambient temp, you'll likely have mild kraut in a week, regular strength stuff in two, and it just gets more...fragrant....beyond that. Once you've got it the way you like just stick it in the fridge to slow the fermentation!"
Austin,3dganm,King_Desmond,2,Thu Jul 16 02:51:36 2015 UTC,Yeah have had a Rachel but much prefer the funkiness of the kraut no question.   I need to have good pastrami and corn beef side by side to tell the difference.   Still can't always tell the difference. Especially Pieous's pastrami.

Austin,3dcve4,Ribauld,9,Thu Jul 16 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"The blame lies with the individual and the general contractor.    The individual was likely trained in fall protection yet chose to ignore his training. Assuming he had a harness available to him he chose not to wear it. They usually ignore these safety rules for convenience, case in point, he was standing on a saw horse instead of taking the time to grab a ladder. I use to work for a GC and it was very common place to kick people of the job for not following safety guidelines, usually they were kicked off after being warned several times. This just further reinforces the notion that there is disregard for safety among the general labor force.    As for the General Contractor, its well known that multifamily GC's don't enforce safety. Multifamily construction is considered to be the wild west of the construction industry where safety is almost non-existent and the quality of work is sub par. I cant tell you how many times I've driven by a project an seen nobody wearing hard hats, guys not wearing harnesses while 40+ in the air, while right next to the edge. Heck its very common to see guys wearing tennis shoes and shorts while working. At this point I'm convinced Multifamily contractors don't even know what safety glasses and vest look like."
Austin,3dcve4,EastsideAg,2,Wed Jul 15 16:55:49 2015 UTC,The earlier stories on this have disappeared but they said that he was wearing a harness and had unhooked it because he couldn't reach something.

If you have a ledge over 4 feet, put a railing up.  Wear a harness when you're climbing, oh and clip it to things.  Yeah thats a good idea.

You can go to court and attempt to sweet talk a judge into a reduced sentence, or you can pay the fine. A lawyer maybe able to get you out of it, but I'm sure it'd cost as much as the fine if not more.   If you pay the fine it will show up on your record and potentially raise your insurance rates.

By impeding traffic, you are making the roads more dangerous for the rest of us.   Traffic regulations exist for a reason, not sure why you would be immune to them.  Pay the fine, and don't do it again!"
Austin,3dg6ch,m4verick03,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:05:39 2015 UTC,"Such helpful people here. You can always apply for differed adjudication. Basically you'll pay the fine and court cost but be on a probation of sorts and afterwards the ticket is dismissed.  Never pay the fine up front, always go to court. You'll never end up worse than paying the ticket and dealing with insurance, as someone who got a speeding ticket on his insurance it wasn't bad, maybe like 10$ more a month and it went back down after about 6 months."

We spontaneously decided to grab a room in Bandera since we were early...we grabbed the last room at the River Front Motel - which are basic but fine little motel cottages along the river for $89 a night.  Easily walk to all the bars.  We fished the river a bit, then hit the bars and had a great time.  Hopefully you can two-step.

I accidentally cut him off- he was riding my blind spot (a favorite for drivers around here!). I waved my apologies, but he tailed me home. I ran into the house and locked all the doors. He began banging on the front door, screaming and calling me a bitch.  More recently, I had my car vandalized at my boyfriends apartment. The parking spots are impossibly small, and I can only assume that my parking pissed somebody off. They squirted a whole bottle of spicy mustard all over my car. It baked in the sun just long enough to cost me $20 at the car wash to get it off. Parts of my car still have a faint yellow tint.   What's up with Texas, y'all? Every one here seems significantly more unhappy, even angrier, than the rest of the country. Just got back from a trip to Michigan and everyone there was noticeably more patient and kind.   I never thought I would say this, but I will be moving out of Texas.

It's like a 35-40 min ride with all the stops.  If you got the time, it's definitely an option.  I got a $130 round trip to Chicago from Houston and i believe it was $400 or something from Austin, so worked for me(plus was no connections).  Filled a gatorade bottle of vodka up on the megabus and cruised on the web on their wifi(slow) on the way there and had a good time.  Can get reserved tickets for an extra $2 where you get a table and stuff, def worth it."

They said they were joining the market to 1) increase speeds for broadband and 2) disrupt the crappy customer service model of the traditional telecomms.  I'll admit they've succeeded at the former, but the latter has been worse in some ways.  I was in the second neighborhood that had sign ups.  We met our quota within hours of the sign ups opening.  Cool.  But, they dragged on and on, delaying the installation and go live dates.  So, I didn't get a chance to use it, and my lease ended.  I found a new place, that actually was in the FIRST sign up area.  I thought, awesome.  I'll get it even faster.  I called them, told them my situation, and asked if they could transfer my sign up.  Not only that, I told them I knew the previous tenants and KNOW that they had also signed up, so the unit itself is definitely already on the installation list.    I was told there was nothing they could do.  I would have to wait for signups to open again for that neighborhood, and no, they couldn't tell me when that would happen.  Despite the fact that they've already probably scheduled the unit.  They just need to transfer the installation to me.  Its changing one damn database row, guys.    Seriously poor experience.  I mean, give AT&T and TWC the crap they rightly deserve, but at least they give a shit about getting you installed and up and running, even if its so they can start billing you."

Austin,3d9fmt,ATX_native,3,Tue Jul 14 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's not like police like shooting people.  You're just deciding that you'd rather ruin someone else's life and bring them down along with you as you die.  So, yeah, pretty damn asshole-ish."
Austin,3d9fmt,letuotter,6,Tue Jul 14 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"So your suggestion is that Austin just has a unique problem with assholes repeatedly suiciding by cop?  At least three of these cases seem to be people having a psychotic break/episode, ending with a fatal gunshot delivered by an APD officer. So why does Austin of all places have the highest police kill rate per person of any major city this year?  I don't dispute that police dislike shooting people - it's a hard burden to live with. I would look to something more systemic, perhaps, like police training for dealing with psychiatric issues."
Austin,3d9fmt,midnightcommand,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"Training for dealing with psychiatric issues isn't going to change anything when someone points a gun, or an object that looks like a gun in the dark right at you. At that point any human, regardless of how trained they are, is operating on instinct and for an officer that instinct will be to open fire. If someone doesn't respect their own life, what makes you think they'll respect yours enough to not pull the trigger? I'd take no chances in that situation, and a cop also has the right to take no chances.   If you have a crazy guy in public pointing a gun at his own head then police training for mental issues will come in handy, but the moment that barrel is pointed at someone else police can, and should open fire."
Austin,3d9fmt,pavlovs_log,0,Wed Jul 15 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"I like the concept, but I can see how it would be a bad thing for them, too.  1) liability - you're essentially forcing cops to take on another role for which they can be blamed if they have to end up shooting the person.  ""Why couldn't you talk them down?"" the media will ask, and try to poke holes in their psychiatric technique instead of just their procedure.  2) it's not their job - I don't call my butcher who's had a few networking classes when my work server goes down, and I wouldn't call a cop to try to defuse a mental case.  should they have a psychiatrist on staff who maybe shows up to scenes?  sure, that'd be nice, but under no circumstances should the cops wait around for him to arrive if there's a bone-fide threat to the community or the officers.  their job is to end the threat, period.  psychoanalysis comes afterwards, if they're lucky enough to be able to take the subject alive.  3) it wouldn't be adequate anyway - psychiatry is an unbelievably dense field of very complex concepts and rules.  these are guys who have already had to essentially memorize the entire legal base of the state and local municipality, do you want to try to add that on as well?  would you expect a cop to make a split-second judgement between someone who is having a schizophrenic episode and someone who's faking?  there's no way that kind of training would really help the police, because you can't help someone like that in such a short, tense situation.  you need time and discussion to try to figure out what's troubling the patient, and neither of those exist when the subject is pulling weapons in the street.  I'm all for more ways to help police use non-lethal force (the unarmed combat training could use a little more emphasis, and maybe they stock the cruiser's shotgun with beanbags by default, for instance), but I have a suspicion that mental health training would be a major expense without much of a payoff.  Shooting situations aren't the right kind of environment for that, and I wouldn't want that trying to fight for attention in the cops' mind when he's trying to determine if the public is in danger."

Austin,3d9fmt,malice_aforethought,0,Tue Jul 14 15:41:09 2015 UTC,The Guardian project that that KUT is using for these stats allows you to rank states per capita (but not cities). TX has a higher rank than NY but lower than CA.
Austin,3d9fmt,midnightcommand,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:21:06 2015 UTC,This is really interesting to counter the whole race war people try to bring up. When using data from this site:  Texas - 26 White 13 Black killed U.S. - 302 White 164 Black
Austin,3d9fmt,complicationsRx,3,Tue Jul 14 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Until you consider that black people only make up about 12 or 13% of the population nationally and in Texas and that they make up half of all people killed by police in these statistics.  The police are much more likely to kill a black person than a white person.  You have to get down to a much smaller sample size, like the people killed in Ausitin this year (6 white, no black) to have whites killed by police outnumber blacks in proportion from the population as a whole.  I strongly suspect that if you extend the data out a few years into the past Austin will look like the rest of the US too.  This exercise is left to the reader."
Austin,3d9fmt,kwinkles,3,Tue Jul 14 21:34:22 2015 UTC,Yeah you make a good point. I guess what I was getting at is the fact the media concentrates and only talks about one side.

Austin,3dap16,StFirebringer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:02:16 2015 UTC,"This would work if there is an officer handy to take a report.  Unfortunately that is getting harder and harder.  They generally only respond to serious wrecks, or take too long to get there if it's not an emergency.  It unfortunately doesn't take a serious wreck to result in something like whiplash.  However if you can get a report, then I think the officer can note it as an injury wreck even if you don't go with emergency services.  That should suffice with an insurance company I should think."
Austin,3dap16,nuovo_donna,6,Wed Jul 15 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"If you aren't hurt and do not request an evaluation, you aren't a patient and there is no bill.   If you are hurt and refuse evaluation, no bill.   If you are hurt and request evaluation, yes there is a bill, same as going to the doctor's office or an urgent care. The providers don't tell you because it is implied: you are using a medical service which has expenses (salary, fuel, supplies, etc).  The city of Austin sets the pricing structure. The fees collected go back to the general fund of the city, not to EMS directly.   If it is an emergency, it is very inexpensive. If not, probably shouldn't be using the ambulance."

Austin,3dap16,jimbonics,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:21:50 2015 UTC,Mine was $1500 for disconnecting from my motorcycle.  I was completely fine but they mandate you go for a drive to the hospital if you fall off your bike - and transport you as if you broke your neck.  I get the safety thing for spinal injuries but I just ended up with a $1500 bill to be told I was fine (when I knew very well I was in fact fine).
Austin,3dap16,caldera,3,Wed Jul 15 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Who mandates it? If you are of sound mind - you know who where when you are, what happened, and aren't under the influence, you have every right to refuse treatment and transport. Of course they will tell you that you should go to the hospital, but that's what they get paid to do."
Austin,3dap16,GoTexan,2,Wed Jul 15 03:03:56 2015 UTC,APD mandated it.  State of Texas perhaps?  Not sure - that's what I was told - repeated I was fine and didn't want to go.  Repeated back I had no choice in the matter.
Austin,3dap16,caldera,7,Wed Jul 15 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"Unless you were under arrest, APD can not mandate you to do anything."
Austin,3dap16,313454787,5,Wed Jul 15 10:50:53 2015 UTC,That is absolutely not true. You cannot be forced to go the hospital unless you are not what described as alert and oriented. Any time outside of that is considered kidnapping. That being said if you agreed to go then you agreed to go.
Austin,3dap16,subcontraoctave,3,Wed Jul 15 03:49:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that isn't true. That sucks.
Austin,3dap16,GoTexan,2,Wed Jul 15 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"also, if someone else calls, and you refuse, there is no bill.  The paramedics will usually check you out to make sure you're not seriously injured, but they won't take you if you don't want to go. Someone nailed the shit out of me on my motorcycle, ems showed up and helped me out, but since I didn't call, they didn't bill me."
Austin,3dap16,Jixr_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:00:49 2015 UTC,So basically what you said was if you get checked out by ems there is a bill. Any idea on these costs vs a hospital? Seems like it should be a lot cheaper but I'm sure it's not
Austin,3dap16,OriginalATX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you use the service, you are billed for it.  Just like going to a doctor.   Vs a hospital?  Can't really compare, it's apples and oranges. EMS stabilizes life-threatening emergencies and transports to a hospital. EMS is an intermediate step to a hospital."
Austin,3dap16,313454787,2,Wed Jul 15 14:22:40 2015 UTC,I can tell you that I very strictly stay out of billing information for patients because it is not my job. My job is to take care of the sick and injured. It's not that I hide relevant information or am trying to sham people out of money for the company. If I have a reason to believe that you are sick/injured I will make a valid argument for you to seek transport to the hospital. After that it is your decision.
Austin,3dap16,subcontraoctave,3,Wed Jul 15 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not all the injuries that can kill you are evident even to EMS. There are cases of blood clots getting knocked loose and causing aneurysms. Spleens, appendicitis and liver damage can all be hard to spot. People have even severed their spinal cords hours after an accident."

Austin,3dap16,313454787,2,Tue Jul 14 21:22:43 2015 UTC,I had a severe back spasm due to an herniated disk. I couldn't get off the bed and the pain was pretty bad. So I called EMS for a ride to the ER since I couldn't drive or get it my friend's car. Was discharged from the ER in an hour with painkillers. The EMS bill was $5000. They didn't do anything other than take me to the ER in a stretcher.
Austin,3dap16,logicbloke_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:32:26 2015 UTC,What city was this in? If it was anywhere in Travis county then that's innacuarate. The bare bones minimum ride to an ER in Travis county in an ambulance (assuming absolutely no medical care was performed) is $840.

EMS asked her if she wanted to be seen and she replied 'no' after having hit her head rather hard against the backrest. In an impaired state with head impact I don't see why they wouldn't just take people to the hospital to get checked out.  Fast forward to one day later and I noticed her talking 25% slower and being really spaced out..Rushed her to emergency room and the head scan revealed a bad concussion. Either way the experience freaked me out, she was eventually fine but you really shouldn't take the risk of refusing. Head injuries are time bombs waiting to happen."

In the case of the people listed in this article, I would be curious to find out what, if any, complaint of injury they had on scene.   In the vast majority of wrecks, EMS arrives and no one is injured. If there are injuries, it is usually very minor.    Thank goodness for safety engineering, most wrecks cause very few injuries."
Austin,3dap16,313454787,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"EMT here:   1- The bill shouldn't be a factor in your decision to go against medical advice from an EMT or medic. I understand some people can't afford it or don't have insurance but your life is worth it. In the end a medical bill you neglected to pay isn't going to matter. We don't discuss payment because we don't care if you pay or not. We're here to help you not collect a bill. You know how many people we transpo that we know beyond a shadow of a doubt aren't going to pay? I assure you an appreciable percentage of patients don't pay and it doesn't matter to us and it shouldn't matter to the patient when it comes to their health.   2- I've seen plenty of people tell me ""they're fine"" and have significant medical issues they're not aware of or too traumatized to notice. Also, just by the mechanism of injury we can tell when it's a bad idea to refuse AMA. I had a patient in a car wreck tell me she was fine as she was standing right in front of me. Not two minutes later she passed out from her concussion. Just because you think you're fine after a traumatic event doesn't make it so. Most EMS providers have been there & done that and know when you should take their advisement for transpo.   3- Most EMS protocols have a CYA approach to medical care. Yes, you may think they are going overboard, but what if you're wrong and they're not going overboard. What if your fender bender knocked a clot loose and it's about to get lodged in your lung? Then what? You'll sue, that's what. You'll sue that negligent medic that didn't press the issue and let you go AMA which caused you to almost die from a PE. Then he'll lose his patch, lose his job, etc. It's not worth it. If they say you should go then just take their advice and go. They're not trying to scam you for money. They're just trying to advocate for you when you may not have even your own best interest in mind."

Austin,3d9r9k,mannnix,25,Wed Jul 15 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"Don't take things out of context, that is not what it is saying. It is an atypical situation, where the often contested inside lane of a 4-lane (or 6 lane) city road is reduced to create a Two-Way Left Turn Lane (TWLTL). This type of augmentation is only applicable in non-access controlled roads (so not 35, Mopac, 183, etc.), and serves to remove the through-traffic congestion caused by stopped vehicles waiting to turn left (Burnet is a great example of where this might be useful). In essence, creating the TWLTL can continuously free the (now reduced) through lane(s), since the through traffic no longer has to stop for drivers looking to merge into their lane in order to avoid a stopped driver turning left.   To issue a blanket statement that, ""...adding lanes is not a solution and that reducing lanes does not cause any problems..."" is a disservice, and incorrect."
Austin,3d9r9k,EasyE0287,-7,Tue Jul 14 16:49:22 2015 UTC,So much this. Adding lanes to highways reduces congestion.
Austin,3d9r9k,4t0mik,8,Tue Jul 14 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"Adding lanes to highways, in an of it self, will not necessarily reduce congestion. It can, potentially, increase congestion on that road (while simultaneously reducing it on other modes). The only guarantee that adding lanes gives is added capacity (storage of vehicles). It is up to designers to add these lanes in a smart, efficient manner that will best suit the public. At this point, Austin needs to accept that there will be no ""fix"" for congestion, and that offering modes to escape passenger vehicle congestion is the only feasible option, while ensuring that complete gridlock does not occur (adding lanes comes into play here).   Managed toll lanes (Mopac, 183, 71) are a new method for allowing persons to escape congestion (albeit a pricey one). Multi-modal public transit is another, but given the extreme lack of connectivity between lines of CapMetro, and the recent denial of Austin Prop 1, that appears to be in a ""holding pattern."" We, Austinites, do need an additional lane on roads like 35 and Mopac, but they need to be enacted in smart ways, where ramps are reassigned/designed to reduce competing merging, and a semi-congestion free alternative is created. Proposing a blanket statement that adding lanes will always help congestion on highways is just as bad as what /u/mannix said."
Austin,3d9r9k,EasyE0287,0,Tue Jul 14 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"In a town like Austin it will. I was very short and vague just because I was on mobile. Induced demand is not something this town has to worry about.  It has ONLY 2 North and South Highways to get to downtown.  Adding the upper deck to I-35 reduced traffic (for 30 years, also don't forget that I-35 is Waco/Dallas/San Antonio commercial traffic). Adding an upper deck to 183 has reduced traffic for 20 years.  Since then traffic congestion increased yes but Austin's population doubled.  So by that theory of not adding lanes taking those away shouldn't be a problem then for congestion? Yea don't think we are going to do that.  Congestion is the time of travel not if it's bumper to bumper. This is the myth a lot of city planners want to convey to get out of not building roads for 20 years and did until 2000s in Austin. The problem is we are growing and NOT building anything is not going to fix it either. Train and in the future Buses will have express lanes? Will more than just 5 percent of the travel population finally take them? Likely not. Now they are finally talking about times of travel only because themselfs are stuck in the traffic (why don't they take the train they voted for).  Well that and it has gotten the attention of national news on how bad Austin travel times are. Adding express lanes (even without tolls) has a huge effect on congestion on that road AND others near it (can't wait for Lamar to free up because of MoPac express). If Austin were to do it, it would have to be an I-35 and Mopac addition. Not one or the other. Exactly what they are finally talking about (moving I-35 to a toll and perhaps free for Travis Country Residents) and pushing commercial traffic to S-130 for free. FYI this was proposed by Austin residents since 1990. We were ignored. Austin citizens have been fighting for new roads for 30+ years. We were completely ignored until just recently. Austin council members used to GIVE our federal highway money or simply refuse it. Only 3 new lanes/roads (major) have been built by the city in 30 years.  You don't do anything and it will get worse.  To add insult to injury the City wanted to BRING traffic into downtown on these crap roads in 1990s when they announced to expand the city center. So since then downtown traffic has more than grown x4 since 1995."

Austin,3d9r9k,tthomas48,8,Tue Jul 14 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"I second this. Expanding highways does not fix traffic. Major US cities have proven this time and time again, yet somehow Austin thinks they can escape history by doing it."
Austin,3d9r9k,alittlejelly,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:53:02 2015 UTC,umm they haven't built a road 20 years (until Mopac express toll) so I don't know how Austin thinks anything. Palmer was the last major city build road/expansion.  183 flyovers were paid by private toll companies.  Edit forgot about 183 expansion in late 1990s/early 2000s. That was forced by the State to Austin.
Austin,3d9r9k,4t0mik,2,Tue Jul 14 18:09:29 2015 UTC,I was referring to the Mopac toll road not fixing shit. Your belief that adding lanes = reducing congestion has been disproved time and time again and have no doubt the expansion of Mopac will be any different.
Austin,3d9r9k,alittlejelly,0,Tue Jul 14 21:14:32 2015 UTC,I was referring to building roads...which Austin hasn't done in 20-30 years. So they have doing exactly what you are saying without building a darn thing. So imagine that we have a traffic problem. Even the toll is a private deal but Austin did finally have to spend some cash. So its not like Austin thinks it won't help.. It won't because they haven't in 30 years citing exactly what you just did...for 30 years. MoPac is the same (minus express) since the 50s. Adding lanes will reduce traffic for a city that has only 2 North to South major roads. A&M study said as much but Austin would have to do both 35 and MoPac. Which btw they are. The lanes added for 35 are SH-130. I-35/turns to a toll for those that live outside the county. At least that is what they are talking about.   So far as the express lane. It will. 20-50 percent of dt traffic comes from North of Palmer (depending on the day). If only 1 out of 5 people take it on any given day that's almost a 25 percent (average) drop at rush hour times. That's pretty big for just one lane added. Not to mention those that will turn up north to jump on it.The express lane might cause dt traffic to go higher at peak times as more get to dt quicker (in and around 5th and Lamar) but that is even being addressed with a fly over in the future.
Austin,3d9r9k,4t0mik,2,Tue Jul 14 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"You really are dense here. Public transit, like Dallas and Houston has built out, is the answer to traffic. Not more roads."
Austin,3d9r9k,alittlejelly,0,Tue Jul 14 23:10:15 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Dallas and Houston have more than 2 roads that run North to South. Pretty sure they have loops and about 4 freeways that are 6-8 lanes wide and...wait for it...express lanes! Really only making my case here. You do realize that Dallas has about 6 major highways that run North to South right? Houston has loops. Yea so tell me again how roads won't fix anything.

One slow vehicle bogs down the whole thing.  I agree adding bike lanes helps, but I think it is a lame excuse for not expanding the road to have two lanes each way plus bike and turn lanes.  Don't get me started about freeways, ours are a mess and these new toll roads are money grubbing bullshit."

Austin,3d9r9k,scottevil,3,Tue Jul 14 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"""Seems"" is an important word in traffic. Many people think that SH-130 is faster than IH-35. And it is from a speed limit perspective. And it may feel faster if you hate sitting in traffic. But IH-35 has to be going about 2 miles an hour or less for SH-130 to get you from point A to point B in less time.  It frequently feels like I'm on IH-35 for an eternity, but if I time it that eternity is often less than 5 minutes."
Austin,3d9r9k,tthomas48,4,Tue Jul 14 19:21:39 2015 UTC,Well it depends on where you're going. If you're going from Round Rock to Austin-Bergstrom then 130's going to be a hell of a lot faster (both are the same distance - 130 will take you 30 minutes and 35 will take you 1 hour). But if you're going 30 miles out of your way just to use 130 then it's not going to be worth it.
Austin,3d9r9k,g192,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:46 2015 UTC,Yeah it depends on when and where you are going.  I go to the airport at least once a month from Round Rock and its usually only a few minutes faster than 183 to get down there.

If you do the Tower Tour, though, I'd highly suggest calling now to get your name on the list and make sure it's not booked up.

Austin,3deg6t,jbirdkerr,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I do have a lot of experience in operating a business. And, I'm just as hungry as they are to make it happen.

Austin,3d6gu0,oranjeboven,8,Tue Jul 14 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you did it right! A few suggestions for the future:   Since you liked Franklin, try some of the other fantastic bbq in town! My favorite is a toss-up between John Mueller Meat Company and La Barbeque. But they're run by off-and-on-feuding members of the same family, so that's no surprise. John Mueller is known as the Dark Prince of Barbeque on account of legendary orneriness and a tendency to be an angry drunk. Life experience growing up in Austin taught me that being a drunk and amazing at bbq sort of go hand in hand.  Rent a bike! Austin is an incredibly bike friendly city (by American standards) and there are lots of fun secret ways to get around that sorta make you feel like you're playing San Francisco Rush. Only slower. And not in the future. Also this city has an expansive, thriving social cycling scene with rides that can be hard, easy, weird, fun, drunk, coffee-fueled, or just celebrating Austin history by doing things like an all-night bike ride visiting each of the 18 moontowers.  Do some of the weird stuff. Cathedral of Junk, the animatronic joke-telling LBJ robot, kooky shops on S 1st, see a random show or improv performance (those last two aren't so unique to Austin, but can still be incredible fun or terrible. I enjoy it wither way, as long as there's heart behind it) Come in August if you want to see the bat swarm. They usually emerge en masse when it's been hot and dry for awhile. It's impressive.  visit ABW brewery. It's quickly become a mainstay of the city.  Pinballz! It's a huge pinball arcade with like 150 pinball machines or thereabouts. Oh, and Peter pan mini golf. Both places are byob."
Austin,3d6gu0,dontforgetpants,5,Tue Jul 14 05:03:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!  I actually did go to Pinballz and that was super fun, so many games from my childhood.  I spent $20 and was there for over an hour.  We actually did have access to bikes during our stay, but honestly, it was way too hot for us - biking wasn't an option.  :P"
Austin,3d6gu0,sh4nn0n,17,Tue Jul 14 11:52:04 2015 UTC,"""Dripping Springs"" is actually Hamilton's Pool, right?  It's closed because of bacteria levels? From the floods?"
Austin,3d6gu0,dylanyo,7,Tue Jul 14 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's Hamilton Pool in the pictures (which isn't actually a spring, right?). I was going to say, the spring in DS (where I grew up, heyo) barely drips, doesn't have any trails afaik and no swimming. The spring is actually completely underwhelming, especially compared to Hamilton Pool.   Hey /u/djw666 your pictures are great and I'm glad you had a good time! I got to live in Calgary once for a while and it was really cool too, Canada is pretty great. :D"
Austin,3d6gu0,kenman,3,Tue Jul 14 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"I grew up in DS as well, 5 minutes from Hamilton Pool!"

Austin,3d6gu0,shut_up_josh,5,Tue Jul 14 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, I think so.  The area is open, obviously, you just can't swim.  Not sure if it's due to the floods or not."

I think spring/very early summer is the ideal time to visit if you actually want to swim."

Austin,3d6gu0,owa00,3,Tue Jul 14 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canadian here. Well, sort of. I liked Austin so much that I moved here!  On the subject of heat, think of an Austin summer like a Canadian winter - you avoid going outside whenever possible, and when you do, you dress to make things as comfortable as possible, even though you'll never be completely comfortable. You really need to be in shorts, a dress, or a swimsuit if you're going to be outside for more than 5 minutes in the middle of July and August."
Austin,3d6gu0,reb0014,2,Tue Jul 14 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"It seems to be a pretty active city, though.  Lots of people out exercising, even in the heat."

It sounds like you still need to visit the Hill Country wineries and go tubing, which were some of the highlights of that visit.  There's a lot to explore and do, so I certainly hope you make it back down again."
Austin,3d6gu0,Dubax,4,Tue Jul 14 05:31:36 2015 UTC,"And you had fun? Jeez. I moved down here from Vancouver in the summer of '94 and I just about died. I couldn't leave the house (and the A/C) for weeks because it was just too damn hot.  E: I mean, Austin is a fun place, but it's hard to get over the heat if you're not used to it. Going from 65-70 every day to 95+ every day is a big jump. Doesn't help that '94 was a very hot summer."

And he has a post about having an $86 gift card from Walgreens that he'll sell for $40. That smells like ""scammer who got a store credit"" to me.

Most hang up, get defensive, or change their mind when questioned about specifics.  One (who sounds like this guy) claimed his male server had muttered a slur under his breath while serving him and wanted a refund. He specified they day and time he had been there, but we only had one male server on staff at the time (very small staff in total) and he had been out of town. Expo/bussers were female that night as well and I'd worked that night and didn't remember him sitting where he claimed he sat either, so I told him that if he came in with his receipt or we could find his credit card record we would discuss it. He got snarky, said he was going to give us a terrible yelp review and called me a bitch so I hung up on him.  Told my manager later and he was like ""yeah that guy sucks. If he ever actually shows up here with a receipt it'll be a miracle.""  So apparently bro gets around."

Always claims the incident was within 7 to 14 days ago.  If the supposed visit was in the restaurant he always claims that staff or other guests were discriminating against him and his party for being gay.  He likes to mix it up by claiming it was a carryout order and that we made a mistake, but it's obviously always cash and he always expects me to send it to him in the mail.  Thus far he's always refused to even give me a phone number.  I always figured he was doing this all over town, because it's always the same script with threatening to go on yelp, or if the place is corporately owned he'll threaten to send in complaints to the central office.  I've never given him anything, but apparently enough places do that he keeps doing it."

I imagine that it's much quieter than a busy place like Peche, but wasn't sure if it was just people sitting around talking in an otherwise quiet room or what. How does the service work? Are drinks made tableside by one of the bartenders or is there a waitress?"
Austin,3dc2m9,GypsyChildren,2,Wed Jul 15 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"It's not a bar to meet new people in. It's not library quiet, but it's far from the rowdy vibe of 6th St. You sit at a booth with your party and the drinks are either brought to you or are made table-side (depending on what you order). Great music, but the vibe is private. Strongly recommended for a date, but not at all the place to knock off after work for a few beers. They take cocktails very seriously, so it's a great experience but not an everyday bar."

I'll have a flexible schedule so I can come in early or late to avoid some of the traffic. I know only a limited amount regarding the traffic situation, but I'd prefer to have ~30min or less commute to work. Hoping that's realistic to be able to live in a solid neighborhood?"
Austin,3dec22,deliriousriot,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"For houses and duplexes, you can hit that price range in the Gracy Farms or Lamplight Village areas.  There are some nice apartment complexes in the Arboretum area that will meet your criteria and be a fairly easy commute.  For houses and duplexes, you will want to use a locator.  They are paid by the property owner and free to the tenant.  Most rental properties are listed in MLS and almost every real estate agency has a couple of agents who only do rentals.  You can search MLS for rentals through a number of online portals including realtor.com.  That is a good way to get a feel for the market and learn areas.  Once you know what you want, you can work with a locator who can run the search on MLS and send you details on each property.  Most duplexes and houses will be occupied by the current tenant or they will have a lockbox.  There can be a lot of phone tag and legwork to set up appointments to see the properties.  A locator will handle all that for you.  You just tell them which ones you want to see and when you are available and they will set up a series of appointments for you and have the applications ready for the ones you like.  Occupancy is very high and July/August is the most competitive time to move.  You will need to be prepared sign and pay a deposit as soon as you see something you like.  If you hesitate, it will be rented to someone else.  Deposits and first months rent will usually need to be paid with a money order.  You can get a money order from HEB (grocery store) for under a dollar and they will let you pay for them with a debit card."
Austin,3dec22,AustinBQ02,-3,Wed Jul 15 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Wow! This is all super awesome information. Thank you so much. The more and more I read these responses, I'm thinking we're going to use a realtor or locator. Having the knowledge to come super prepared regarding deposits and such is awesome. I didn't realize July/August was such an intense time to move to Austin."
Austin,3dec22,tienistien,2,Wed Jul 15 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"Also, move here, and live in an apartment for 1 lease term (typically a year). Get to know the neighborhoods.  Then you can drive around and find a ""for rent by owner"" house. They are everywhere, and usually better than a renting or leasing company."
Austin,3dec22,lm1435,-2,Wed Jul 15 20:32:03 2015 UTC,More than likely this will be our situation. I feel like there's so many different neighborhoods to explore - it's crazy. I wasn't aware there was such a large amount of houses to rent by owner. They're pretty uncommon where we live now.
Austin,3dec22,mannnix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend using Google maps and watching the traffic in the area during peak times to see if it's something you want to deal with. For example there are a couple of complexes right off Parmer Ln that would be in your price range, the problem is that they're located where Parmer gets the most backed up and Parmer is the only street you can enter from or exit onto from the complex."
Austin,3dec22,lm1435,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:35:11 2015 UTC,Good to know. Google maps is a great idea to figure out what it looks like at peak times. Thanks!
Austin,3dec22,leeharris100,2,Wed Jul 15 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Austin! I work near Mopac & Braker and I used to live here. It was such a simple commute and the apartment itself was on the perfectly acceptable end of average (with two beautiful pools to boot). It's close to several bus routes that go directly downtown, so it's also nice for easy exploration of the city when you're off work. I can't stress enough that you should try to live in a location with a reverse commute (heading away from downtown in the morning and back toward it at night). If you live south of the river and have to fight traffic to get through downtown every day, you will regret it over time. You can also look into Midtown Commons, Burnet Flats, and Waller Creekside on 51st. Those are all probably closer to the max end of your budget, but they're a little nicer and still a very reasonable commute to the area."
Austin,3dec22,leeharris100,0,Wed Jul 15 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The place you linked looks real nice - we'll check it out. Same with the others that you listed.  This mirrors a lot of what I've heard in regards to the traffic. We've been looking around online in the area north of downtown that is in the little highway ""loop"" (not sure if that's actually what it's called) - east of mopac, south of 183, north of downtown and west of 35. That would have me headed away from downtown in the morning, and towards downtown in the evening."
Austin,3dec22,realname13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:21:41 2015 UTC,"Riata has some 1/1's around that square footage for around that price. Might be a good idea for a young couple just moving to Austin because of the amenities and other offerings there, and it wouldn't be too terribly far from work.

Austin,3db3mo,moundman84,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:26 2015 UTC,I've toobed it from 30 cfs to 800 cfs...at 30 cfs of course it is bony and you're gonna walk the rapids but it was still fun to float the pools and get in the creek.  This May and June spoiled us though so we haven't done a desperate toob trip yet.
Austin,3db3mo,LoveForChrist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:08 2015 UTC,DO NOT TUBE IT OVER 400 CFS YOUR FIRST TIME! THE ROUTE GOES THROUGH MANY TREES AND CAN BE HAZARDOUS AT HIGHER FLOWS. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE TROUBLE EVADING RAPIDS AND SMALL WATERFALLS.
Austin,3db3mo,moundman84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"probably good advice...200 cfs is a good flow for noobies, not much butt scraping and not so fast that you get into trouble in trees.  I'm a Barton Creek toobing pro however....and it was probably closer to 700 cfs when we did it...been meaning to get my gopro footage together from that trip...it is actually a lot of fun and even easier than lower flows because features are washed out."

In no way has it ever been faster, that's just something you decided and put in your head.  Doesn't make it true.  Again... The ferry is a huge variable in that route too.

Austin,3d9uio,RichardBuns,2,Wed Jul 15 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty surprised no one has posted these yet.  Hamilton Pool is a stunning little piece of nature. You can spend the whole day at the pool itself, but there is also a nice little hike if you don't want to stay put all day. This is important though: they only let in so many cars at a time. After that, admission is on a one-in, one-out basis. Show up early (9am on the weekends) and carpool. But this is definitely one to do.  Krause Springs is a great place for swimming. There are tons of little nooks and crannies to set yourself up in. You can camp there, they'll have picnic/barbeque areas all set up, and I think there is even a butterfly garden. Go here if you're looking to spend the day relaxing and swimming.  Pedernales Falls has some nice trails with really nice hidden creek pools. The falls themselves are fun to roam, though you can't actually swim in them. I like Pedernales because it is far less crowded than Hamilton or Krause. I'd recommend Pedernales if you're just looking to get away. There are creeks that cross the hiking trails (there are two close to the start of the Wolf Mountain trail). Follow them and you'll find a nice secluded swimming hole. Perfect place for a picnic.  There's also a day trip that I'd recommend within Austin. Go check out Mayfield Park off of 35th. They have roaming peacocks, nice ponds, and great trails. Right next door is an art school that is also worth checking out. They have equally nice trails that are scattered about with contemporary art."

All 24 hour fitness requires from you is your name and fingerprint when you sign up.

Honestly, you should probably go to r/legaladvice for actual...legal advice.  But, in my opinion, there are two clearly marked handicap spaces there and you apparently parked in one of them.  Pleading no contest might get you a slight reduction in fine, but I'm not sure how the court handles that.  I've only been downtown for a speeding ticket, which may be (and probably is) handled differently."
Austin,3dcqnv,iliveintexas,2,Wed Jul 15 07:10:51 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Which space were you in relative to the cars in the Street View photos?
Austin,3dcqnv,GoTexan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like the handicap sign has an arrow pointing to the right, which I think basically means, ""this sign applies to all the parking spots from here on down until there's a different sign or the parking spots stop."""
Austin,3dcqnv,tviolet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:45 2015 UTC,I know someone who got a ticket in the exact same space and was able to call 311 and talk to an engineer who wrote an email to muni court so try that. Evidently the spaces were reconstructed and the signs are messed up.
Austin,3dcqnv,tviolet,0,Wed Jul 15 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's funny that they parked in the exact same spot... Do you happen to know what exactly they said was messed up about the spot? It's be good to have an idea of that before I call. I appreciate the help!"

In Mexico it comes in a plastic bottle with a big ring you can hold onto so when you're blotto, you can't drop it. Purely for getting seriously fucked up.

Austin,3d7tdp,weiss27md,6,Tue Jul 14 04:39:34 2015 UTC,Went to Kerlin's a couple of months ago. Around 11am on a Saturday. There was literally nobody else there. I thought I had gone to the wrong place at first. The brisket was very good. The ribs were not bad.
Austin,3d7tdp,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Tue Jul 14 13:17:49 2015 UTC,another vote for Kerlin. Brisket is on point. Just went this weekend. Texture beats out Mickelthwait and is very close to Franklin's.

But then ""north"" can also mean that same area, OR it can mean so far north that it's not actually inside Austin at all. I never know which ""north Austin"" someone means without more specifics.  In this case, Stiles Switch is north of downtown, for sure, but a good bit south of Pflugerville, where the OP is."

Austin,3d7tdp,Cadillacjacques,0,Wed Jul 15 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The population center has shifted, and just as you can gauge the age of a tree by counting its rings, you can gauge the newness of an Austin transplant by how far north he thinks ""central"" is.

Austin,3d7tdp,ahaley,2,Wed Jul 15 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"It's about as good as gas station BBQ in Texas.  Like I said, it could be worse.  I wouldn't crow about liking the BBQ at the 12th or 15th best BBQ around Austin. That makes it look like you don't know anything about BBQ or good food.  There are places with better BBQ than Salt Lick in town that don't require standing in line.  Besides, Salt Lick has a 3 hour wait on the weekends. What's your point regarding lines, when Salt Lick has one of these longest lines on the Austin area, and for pedestrian BBQ no less?"

Austin,3d7tdp,Tom_Pain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:52:23 2015 UTC,I disagree. I would guess I have eaten there 20 times in the last few years and I would say only 1-2 of those meals were sub par (for him).  The rest have been what is expected (fan-fucking-tastic BBQ) with a few of those being even better than what is expected.   That's just my experience and taste is subjective.

I've been pulled over three times by this officer in this same spot. Each time for driving 5 MPH over the speed limit. Today, I was pulled over for going 46 MPH in a 35, which I know is completely false, as I was looking at the speedometer—I've gotten into the habit, knowing that it is a speed trap here. Consider yourself warned! I'll be taking a new route to work, going forward.  Edit: Let me clarify a few points. I've been driving for 25 years. In this almost 3 decades of driving, I have received exactly three traffic violations. All of them at this speed trap, at the exact same time of day, issued by the same police officer. In addition, I said I was issued tickets ""for driving 5 MPH over the speed limit"" but I did not state that I was in fact speeding—I do not believe I was.  I posted this to warn others, not to garner any kind of sympathy. That's what neighbors do—they look out for the folks around them. Don't be so judgmental, r/Austin."

I was riding next to another car and very much watching my speed. I think the only reason I walked away without a ticket was because when my helmet came off it he realized I wasn't a young guy on a sportbike. We did have a discussion about how he thought my speedo could be wrong, but I insisted that according to gps, I knew exactly what speed I was traveling at. I think I really only won the argument when he couldn't be 100% sure that it was me he clocked and not the traffic coming from the other direction and slowing from a 65mph zone. Either way I can see where it's plausible that you are tagged for a speed well over what you are actually doing."

Austin,3d4rv5,jint3i,7,Tue Jul 14 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm 32 and I got the first and only speeding ticket of my life earlier this year near this area (the next bit north where Dean Keaton goes under I-35). I was running late for a flight (I work at UT and got held up working.. this was around 11:00 am) and kind of gunned it after waiting at the light at the top of the hill. I apparently was going 42.  Really had no clue the limit was 30 here because it has the feel of something closer to 40 given the proximity to the highway and the width of the lanes.. cop wouldn't let me off with a warning even given my circumstances. :( Did the online traffic school and all that, but was still out $150 or so."
Austin,3d4rv5,AButtFifty,5,Tue Jul 14 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"So I got a speeding ticket in this exact spot as well (where Dean Keaton goes under I-35) and was also clocked going 42 even though I believe there was no way for me to be going that fast as I had turned from a complete dead stop and by the time I saw the cop in the SUV he already had his lights on (he was in the median facing me head on). My good friend also received the exact same speeding ticket, same quoted speed of 42, by the same cop, at the same time (different days).  I work at UT and this cop is out there practically every day and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same cop on MLK. I didn't have enough time to contest the ticket so I did the traffic school route as well. Something seems a little off, especially since your alleged speed was the same as our's."
Austin,3d4rv5,iamsuchasucker,3,Mon Jul 13 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting! He must have been in the median for me as well since looking at the street view, there isn't really any room for him to have been parked on the side of the road I guess since it's a sidewalk and bike path. It was all kind of a blur -- I figured he was after someone else initially to be honest.   I didn't think I was up to that speed since it was so soon after the stop light, but I figured with going slightly downhill and being a bit frantic about missing my flight that I probably was just going faster than I realized. I would not at all be surprised if it's a scam of sorts though given the coincidence of this."

Austin,3d4rv5,QUATARUS,11,Mon Jul 13 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"That area is full of parking cars, cyclists, and pedestrians. On that road is also UT's Child Development Center which is a pretty large daycare for UT students and staff. Though it's not a school with a posted school zone limit, it should be one probably.   It's one thing to go 75 in a 70 on a highway or something, but speeding even 5mph through residential roads like this increases the chances of accidents happening significantly.   Sucks you say you weren't speeding and you got clocked as speeding, however you admitted to doing 5MPH over on other occasions which you just should not do through that area even if you think it's safe. Doing 40MPH instead of 35MPH will take you an extra 20'ish or so feet to come to a complete stop in an emergency braking situation. Even if it's not ""your fault"" if a cyclist darts into traffic, or a car leaving its parking spot doesn't see you, or a child runs away from the playground at the daycare into traffic if you could have avoided the accident by doing 35mph instead of 40mph then everyone walks away a winner (and walks away).   Edit: I fucked up and was thinking of Manor a block over. None the less, even though there's no daycare it's still full of other dangers that means you shouldn't speed on the road even that 5mph buffer we all assume exists. Just stop speeding through these types of streets."

I would also classify riding on 71 as pretty dangerous in some areas. There is road work reducing it to one lane and no shoulder in parts. Be careful.

Austin,3d9q21,Sux_to_bee_u,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy ride 71. In lieu of that, I'd make my way to Barton Creek Blvd via Southwest Parkway or by cutting through Freescale and taking Old Bee Caves. Slower traffic and much more room. Barton Creek will hook up with 2244 and you can go from there."

Austin,3d7eja,JesusWhataBother,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, what you had are burglaries. Robbery and burglary mean different things. I pulled these definitions from here, one of many sites to pick from:  http://www.asecurelife.com/burglary-vs-robbery/  Burglary Burglary is defined by the law as the unlawful entry to a structure to commit theft or a felony. In order for burglary to take place, a victim does not have to be present. When a burglary takes place, the structure being unlawfully entered can be any number of building types including business offices, personal homes and even garden sheds. Burglary is not the term used for crimes committed on cars.  Robbery Robbery is defined by the law as taking or trying to take something from someone that has value by utilizing intimidation, force or threat. In order for robbery to take place, a victim must be present at the scene and can occur with a single victim or, in cases like bank hold ups, multiple victims."
Austin,3d7eja,ImFromHereDamnit,-21,Wed Jul 15 13:20:57 2015 UTC,"That's not a robbery, that's a burglary. Sorry it happened to you, your stuff is likely long gone by now sorry. If you had serial numbers you could add them to the police report. When you do that and crooks try to pawn things the crooks get identified as such and you get back any items that were pawned. Of course few people think ahead like that and thus serial numbers don't get recorded.  Cameras that notify your smartphone when there is movement combined with an alarm system have worked extremely well for us. Although we don't live in 44 we spend a LOT of time away from home and we have lots of footage of shady types coming up to the door, seeing the camera(s), and leaving immediately after they see the camera never to return.  Why not take a minute and ask yourself if you really need all that stuff anyway. Austin is chock full of fun stuff to do, sounds like you spent a lot of time indoors staring at a screen. In some podunk town with nothing to do I could understand that behavior, but in Austin? Makes little sense."

If you can't afford to leave him and don't know anyone who can help you and can't live with yourself if you drop him at a shelter or give him away, you may not be able to go. Dogs are for life! There are so many people who go into dog ownership seeing them as accessories to enjoy for a limited time. Not saying this is you, and hopefully there is an amazing redditor willing to watch your pup for you, but I got my dog knowing I wouldn't be able to pick up and move without her for the next 20 years (and I hope she makes it that long!)."
Austin,3da7cs,allegrak23,13,Tue Jul 14 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, dogs, much like kids, are burdens when you want to travel.  You really have to calculate pet care as part of your entire trip total and by the sounds of things, you haven't saved enough to actually go abroad.  That said, have you checked into rover?

Go check out a show and the old folks, young folks, and scuzzy kids dancing at The White Horse; and make sure to grab a taco at the trailer out back.

As a taxpayer who is funding this huge use of resources I'd really appreciate some direct answers as to why this is necessary at all when the military has bases all over the globe with all kinds of training facilities at their disposal. They train military in situations as similar as possible to where they expect to deploy the troops. Or at least this has always been the case in the past. Anyway, Chuck Norris and his fans aside, this seems like a big waste of money to me in a time when more Americans than ever before are forced to claim social benefits and use food banks to avoid homelessness."

Combine that with Jade Helm and the executive branch's refusal to enforce any immigration laws to the mix and it's not hard to imagine that many Texans would have a concern.
Austin,3d4y5t,adm1r4ltx,13,Mon Jul 13 18:44:14 2015 UTC,Wat.
Austin,3d4y5t,acelaya35,8,Mon Jul 13 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"So, Obama wants to, what, NOT enforce immigration law, and he needs the military to do it? And not just any military -- certainly not the thousands of troops based all over the state -- but a special handful of troops brought in to take over Texas from its political powerhouse of Bastrop?  Your accusation is a hodgepodge of unrelated political talking points that, when treated as a coherent plan, doesn't stand up to scrutiny."

Austin,3d7xqa,toolman-tim,4,Tue Jul 14 05:24:10 2015 UTC,Mueller Lake Park has a picnic table on the grassy lawn near the cluster of trees  closest to Camacho (a little southwest of the fire hydrant).    Another option: The other pond at the south end of the Southwest Greenway has picnic tables that I've never seen anyone using.  People fish there sometimes but they're usually down close to the water.  You'd have to park close to the Tom Miller @ Berkman intersection.

You wear long pants in the summer with boots to protect your legs from whatever you may be working around that requires you to wear boots in the first place, such as insects, rocks, briars, concrete (nothing worse than kneeling on concrete and scraping yourself all up), etc.  And to blow your cubicle-mind even more we also wore long sleeve shirts during the summer too - to protect from insects mostly, and sunburn, and then stuff like welding sparks, chemical spills, etc."

You're right, we all have different values and priorities in life...  But that doesn't mean that a rich man's next supermodel affair should be communally supported in the same way as a poor man's next meal should be...    I think special interests trumped actual equality a long time ago in Austin.  There are many people who call themselves democrats by way of liberal special interest, but very few of them are truly socialists in that they want equal opportunity for everyone...  they mostly just want to get theirs and help their friends get theirs...  to Hell with everyone else.

To me, that's a non partisan issue. has nothing to do with some asshole at a music show critiquing your jacket. That's guy's just an asshole. Ignore him.  EDIT:    Soon, your 'non-judgmental environment' will have to be way out in the middle of nowhere, because rent in Austin will be too damn high.   And that, my fiend, is why I just bought a house. It's old and needs a LOT of work (Because who can afford new housing in Austin? Not this guy) but I never have to worry about rent going up again. Rent is already awful in Austin. But you'd be hard pressed to correlate the raising rent prices with tattooed lesbians having too much sex."

Austin,3da9ix,putzarino,0,Tue Jul 14 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you don't want to acknowledge that there are social problems destroying the solidarity of several scenes which are currently being crushed by unopposed gentrification, that's fine... but it's your town they are corporatizing, your clubs they are closing, your affordable housing they are bulldozing to put up yuppie condos. And no amount of negligent pretending it isn't happening, in the name of being 'non-judgmental', is going to stop it.   There's been an ebb and flow in the music scene in Austin for decades. Venues close, others open—circle of life. People have literally been decrying the end of ""Austin"" for decades. Gentrification is not a new topic here, either. South Austin was gentrified before East Austin. And before that, it was the west side. The increasing prices of central housing isn't just an issue in Austin, it's nationwide, as millennials are returning to cities, where their parents had fled to the suburbs.  It's an ebb and flow. We know that. We don't need a new-to-town SJW to tell us."

Austin,3da9ix,smcdow,3,Tue Jul 14 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'll leave the condescending criticisms of yourself to other people here whose egos need that kind of thing and just throw you a bone and make some comments (number based on your list).   No one is a bigger whiner (not meant to be a pejorative) about this matter than Billy Corgan. While I think a lot of his rants are more about him trying to justify why people aren't into SP as much anymore (the real reason being that his latest music sucks compared to his classic albums), he does have some valid points about how the DIY culture has been commercialized, and people who sport the DIY fashion trend are a caricature of the very thing they are trying to be a part of. It's the whole ""I'm different just like everyone else"" thing. Back in punk/alternative days, there was a moment in time when dressing punk or grunge (e.g. wearing an old sweater from Goodwill), was legitimately against the grain/norm, and you were truly different. That moment in time faded real fast, though.  Like it or not, people love to tout their cheerleader stance on socially progressive issues. While people in a lot of cities around the country are silently supportive of a lot of socially progressive things, we live in a city where people are overtly proud of being progressive and will do things like hire folks or befriend people who are part of that socially progressive movement. While I do think it is important we continue to blend those who are still considered ""different"" into mainstream culture so they no longer continue to be considered as such, I find that intrinsic character traits are overlooked because of what is on the outside. This is not good. Just because someone is different, doesn't mean they aren't a shitty person. Some have a hard time understanding this. I think it's demeaning - you're essentially treating someone like an object, and not valuing that person for who they are.  People all over the world are fucking like rabbits. Austin is no different. We do have a lot more single people, so it likely happens here more than other places. As for if promiscuity impacts someone's livelihood - all depends on the precautions one takes when engaging in sexual behavior. I think all humans have their excess behaviors. For some, it just happens to be sex. I wouldn't sweat it so much. People hate it when something they cherished becomes more widely-loved because they fear it will become tarnished by disingenuous or inauthentic pursuits to profit off of it instead of respecting its value. This is unavoidable. The best thing I can suggest is that you look at the bright side of something you love becoming more mainstream so that you can get more of it. Someone was complaining about how they've loved Ant-Man for years, and only now does anyone care about it. I told them that this is a good thing - now the thing they love is getting movies made about it, all because more people like it now. Yes, you will have to weed out the good EDM from the bad EDM because it there is more quantity than quality, but there is still more of the latter to choose from now - a winning point. I will cherry pick from previous comments I made and say that these things are now mainsteam, and people have their excesses. For some, it's body art/modification. Not really worth caring about in the grand scheme of life.  Remember when you were a teenager and you thought you were so enlightened and smart and your parents just didn't get it? This is a cyclical experience in life. The ""College Liberal"" (or variations like it) phase is one we all go through as well. Just smile and nod at these people, they really care about so many things right now, in a few years it will be mortgages, babies, and taxes that rule their existence. No need fighting with them about their values and concerns for the moment. I am in my 30s, and the only person my own age who still cares about all those things is a guy who has no relationship and no job, probably because he's still stuck in his ""the political and social Zeitgeist means everything"" phase, and it's all he wants to talk or care about. Pain and/or fear of death will cure people of their stubbornness. Again, just smile and nod. My family is best friends with another family whose son is all of these things to a T. Really think about who or how you would be if you were in his situation - no job, all the money in the world to do whatever you want with. Take away a person's need to work, or work hard, in order to gain a footing in life, and you see a much different person form in front of you. Do they negatively affect others? Only if those others are easily affected and led by the nose. What does it matter where the piper goes, and what becomes of the rats who follow? Just keep doing what you do while they find their answer at the bottom of the cliff. Sarcasm definitely became a trend in the 80s and 90s. You could see it permeating popular culture. I think society has just moved on from its appreciation for or overuse of sarcasm. I guess we could also be complaining that no one says ""tubular"" or ""radical"" anymore, either. But, what's the point? I think you're having an experience, an epiphany of sorts. It's a transitional stage where you start shedding yourself of all the cares and mindsets you have/had in your 20s, and start realizing that things you cared about are suddenly having much less impact and time in your brain as they once did. We hate the qualities in others we see in ourselves the most, and as we start subconsciously caring less about certain matters, we consciously see how much others still care about the same things. It's important not to become critical of others since they're in a different phase than you are. I think it's best to just smile and say ""man, I remember those days of caring about those things"" with fondness, like a trip down memory lane. I find myself mentally chastising my little sister for worrying about the things she worries about sometimes, but then I stop and realize when I was in her shoes or her age, I used to care about that shit too."
Austin,3da9ix,putzarino,-8,Tue Jul 14 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your honest and understanding feedback.  I didn't expect to make any friends via criticism, but all I can say is that there are many Austinites who needed to hear this rant...  If only to temper their own bias.  I'm not necessarily trying to convert anyone to straight white male middle-ageism...  I just want to let them know how dumb many of them look to a regular workingman Joe six-pack...  Even one who used to be 'cool'.    But it seems to me that Austin can be home to a lot of extremism, and that's simply impractical and not very down-to-Earth...  Which is exactly what will be the doom of even the moderate scenesters...  extremist bad examples.  Anyone who really cares about the scene shouldn't let the worst extremists represent it, because they will do so very poorly.  And then the hammer comes down on all of us."
Austin,3da9ix,ATXBeermaker,3,Tue Jul 14 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"Austin is a vibrant culture that is full of liberal pop culture lovers. The things you pointed out just go along with the interests of the city. You're kind of being the person at a music concert who starts complaining about the noise level. There is an exit sign, you're never forced to stay put. I don't say that in a snarky manner. If you are truly unhappy with where you are at, it is really unhealthy to just stay there and let the bad vibes foster."

Austin,3da9ix,rednoise,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm just saying, all of your suggestions reflect your own privilege.  ""Don't like your neighborhood?  Move.'  I never intended to be here.  I landed here after a bad divorce.  I'm just kinda stuck here on probation.    In terms of 'just go hang out with different people', I mean, once again, that would be easy if I went to high school here, knew everyone, and everyone knew.  As it is, this town is extremely closed off to outsiders, and you aren't gonna realize that unless you truly have the outsider's perspective.  But yeah, friends are rare and they turn on you pretty quick.  I been through a few fast friends in this town, for sure.  To enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship with the local social establishment, that's a privilege of growing up here.  And the people who have it are so obviously spoiled by it, they don't know what it's like for transplants.  So in other words, your suggestions are impractical for a man in my position, and only betray your lack of understanding caused by your own social privilege."

The fact that the locals don't admit they are all hustlers and it's just like any other big city, that only betrays how complicit they are on all the scams.    I just get tired of anyone acting differently.  This pay it forward attitude amongst the locals is merely baiting kindness they have no intention of reciprocating.  The locals feel like they can stick their hat out and catch the rain of money from all the development here in town.  It's a self-entitled bunch and if you are in denial of that it's because you in on it.    It's a college town and a tourist town and many locals only exist to fleece the flock.

SJWs can go to places where women and minorities are actually oppressed if they actually care, but they don't  They have set up shop in a place where they can be comfortable at the expense of educated people.

A truth to which many Austinites are in denial.  And it’s just tacky and insensitive.  I’m not saying sex is always bad, but it isn’t always good either.  We all want to be loved and get laid, but there are ethical ways to fulfill your needs.  Manipulation, deception, and exploitation, once again, are the kind of behaviors that are turning Austin from a friendly small town into a scary big city full of shysters.  So if you’re going to play with others who are similarly inclined, at least be an ethical slut.  Don’t be a despotic misinformationist who abuses the social privilege that promiscuity and social ruthlessness can create.  And let the monogamists have their marriages, for crying out loud.  If you want your turf you have to give them theirs.  This could be a community that tolerates both monogamy AND polygamy if people stopped over-stepping their bounds.   Who is telling monogamists to not get married? My wife and I have never been assaulted by a polygamist or anti-marriage folks or ""sluts"" ever, and we are natives. And what social cohesion is broken by people choosing to be promiscuous? Who really gives a flying fuck, if it doesn't affect you?"

Austin,3d25ae,failingtolurk,5,Mon Jul 13 01:17:12 2015 UTC,They rented out menu space to saying they use Sysco... Nuff said.

Austin,3d25ae,defroach84,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:19:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure all of their mainstays are $4.50 (as of last month).
Austin,3d25ae,jwall4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:09:29 2015 UTC,I was there on Saturday. $5.50 for mainstays. $6 for pub series.

Austin,3d25ae,failingtolurk,3,Mon Jul 13 12:34:55 2015 UTC,Soleil was awesome!  Hate that the place closed but i imagine rent costing a pretty penny at the oasis because of the location.  Their calamari was to die for :) and they tended to always have a live jazz band when i went.  They had a great happy hour too.
Austin,3d25ae,SolAggressive,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:34:18 2015 UTC,Brunch there was amazing.

Austin,3d25ae,scottevil,2,Mon Jul 13 04:57:50 2015 UTC,See. That's what I was told but when I went in April they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about -_-
Austin,3d25ae,draconicanimagus,2,Mon Jul 13 10:31:13 2015 UTC,The Roscoe was served at all the stores through April.

When you go to Uppercrust, ask the person behind the counter what their personal favorite item is, that should give you a good starting point!

The place was nice, good music playing (2005-2009 Alt Nation kind of stuff) and the service was beyond nice. Pretty stylish joint too. If you're looking in the Westgate area this is a great addition to the neighborhood. Its not on your list but consider checking it out if you're in the area sometime."

Austin,3d1aba,dsteelenet,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"In theory they can make them available for adoption in as little as three days, but usually the dogs are there for longer than that before they're available for option depending on how full it is.  (I'm a volunteer there.)  But I should point out that /r/austin isn't the right place for posting lost/found pet posts since these kinds of posts are relevant to most people, except the couple of people who actually lost or found the pet so I don't recommend upvoting these kinds of posts here (which are getting more frequent lately).  These posts should be posted to places like craigslist where pet owners can search for their pets."

Instead use:  http://austin.craigslist.org/search/laf  /r/AustinPetLostAndFound  http://austintexas.gov/department/lost-found-pet  Also check the Austin Animal Center’s Twitter account @austinanimals. The @austinanimals Twitter account is updated every 30 minutes with stray pets that have recently entered the shelter.  Come to the Animal Center to look for your lost pet as soon as possible. Due to the large number of animals, some may be held for only three days after intake. It is recommended you visit the shelter at least every other day to check for your lost pet.  Between shelter visits, search an online database of lost animals that are in the shelter. This is not as reliable as visiting the shelter in person and is not a substitute for visiting the shelter. This map shows all stray cats and dogs that are currently in AAC's care for no longer than a week. The Image column has a link to the animal's most up-to-date image.  Found Pets  Most stray animals are owned by someone. Don’t keep an animal that you find without first making a real effort to locate the owner. Talk to neighbors and post signs.  If you can keep the found pet temporarily, call or contact 3-1-1 online to submit a Found Animal Report.  If you bring in a found pet, please provide info about where and when it was found.  If you have found a stray pet and cannot bring it to the shelter, contact 3-1-1. Animal Protection should be able to pick it up.  Open Intake Shelter  The Austin Animal Center is an open-intake animal shelter serving the City of Austin and Travis County. It accepts any animal that needs shelter, regardless of age, health, species, breed or behavior, and no matter whether it is a stray or an owned animal.  If you find your pet:  As a Travis County Resident, you can get a free microchip and ID tag for your pet. If your pet is not microchipped and/or does not have an ID tag, please come down to Austin Animal Services during the hours of 11am to 7pm to get a free microchip and/or ID tag for your pet."

Posts about lost or found pets are useful for exactly two people in all of Austin, the person who lost the pet, and the person who found a pet.  When a person finds or loses a pet, they can go to sites like craigslist and search for the matching animal.    The other 99.99% of /r/austin readers don't need to see these posts because they have nothing to do with anyone who isn't currently searching for their pet or found a pet.

Austin,3d2dad,gailelizabeth,2,Mon Jul 13 01:42:20 2015 UTC,They only require a one year commitment at a time as that's the length of a case before it's transitioned to permanent conservatorship of the state or back to the family.

Once a quarter, you'll have court, and usually 2-3 times during the life of your case you'll have a hearing with CPS.

The paid supervisors take on 4 to 12 cases and supervise their volunteers' cases. Taking on 1 case at a time makes it way more manageable.

Having blood on your truck is suspicious but also not illegal. Who knows what was going on here but that's the disturbing part. This man is denied due process now so we won't ever know for sure.   I personally think cops should wait to shoot until they are shot at or at least someone draws and points a weapon. This gun in the waistband stuff needs to stop."

Austin,3d3o6q,vato956,2,Mon Jul 13 08:34:50 2015 UTC,It's pretty popular for the car tuner crowd.  Higher octane allows for higher compression ratios which equates to more power.

Austin,3d504f,Filthyloins,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:42 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for a quick reply.    Apart from the trash issue I am guessing from your opinion its a average place to live in.  For me its a little more expensive to stay here but the added benefits are closer to work; closer to pure austin (planning to join this gym) and closer to highways and stores etc.  Would you recommend this apartment ?
Austin,3d504f,ilovetrackpads,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Lived here for a bit in 2014.  Never really had an issue with the office staff, however as with just about any apt complex, get copies of everything you sign especially deposits for pets, etc and make note of what check was used for what, etc.    Valet trash is a trainwreck.  Generally most people follow the rules, however there were some tenants near us that routinely set rank trash out too early or over a long holiday weekend just to sit there.  A message to the office would usually clear it up.  I would usually just walk the trash to the dumpster as I found leaving it outside the front door to be gross.  People were surprisingly good about picking up their dogs' crap for the most part.    Would recommend with the caveats that you should document what you have paid upfront, etc and that the valet trash may turn some folks off.  However the trash thing isn't unique to this property.  The light at Stonelake and Breaker sucks ass."

Overall can't complain too much, other than valet trash which is a total waste.  Living next to Pure Austin is pretty great, easily the best part of being here. It's nice being able to just walk over to the gym or go open water swimming at the lake. Not tough to get out to some good cycling areas either if that's your thing.  Let me know if there's anything you're curious about!"
Austin,3d504f,benhdavis2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"Lived here for a bit.   The trash service is stupid I lived on the third floor, it was completely uninsulated, it cost a small fortune to keep at ~78 (about as cold as it got) degrees in the summer (> $400/mo) The lake is really more about the gym, you can't swim in it, etc., you can only walk around it (which is nice)   That being said, it was pretty nice for the most part."

Austin,3d1cdz,Txkevo,11,Sun Jul 12 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"The San Marcos is really 2 different floats.  The upper San Marcos AKA ""Lions Club"" float is a lot like the Comal.  It goes from City Park to Rio Vista Falls and takes about 30-45 minutes.  River left is mostly private homes on large lots; river right is parkland.  The water is clean and cold since it is fresh from the underground springs.  It can be very crowded on the weekends and holidays.  It is an easy, family-friendly float.  The park rangers patrol regularly including an undercover guy in a canoe and SMPD will haul you of the water for smoking pot or drunken behavior or underage drinking.    The lower San Marcos is a lot like the Guadalupe.  There are more rapids and it is more like a half day float.  This is the stretch from Thompson Island down to Martindale.  There are a couple of tubing outfitters working out of Westerfield Crossing which is about the halfway point.  The river mostly passes through ranch land during that stretch.  The crowd is mostly college-aged up to late 20's and they are mostly just there to drink, smoke, and be rowdy.  There is minimal law enforcement presence.  They leave a lot of trash and it is getting to a breaking point with the homeowners.  I expect to see the counties and the state to be stepping up enforcement and passing ordinances in the next few years."
Austin,3d1cdz,sxzxnnx,2,Sun Jul 12 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Nice response, good info.  We kayaked from Lions Club down to Don's Fish Camp a few weeks ago...not even peak tubing season (they had just reopened the toobing outfitters) and some of the gravel bars were ALREADY trashed.  Amazing..I just don't get how it's hard to put your cans in an onion bag and float em back."
Austin,3d1cdz,moundman84,2,Sun Jul 12 21:05:45 2015 UTC,"The San Marcos is really 2 different floats.   I really enjoyed Don's and since Lions also says San Marcos river on their website I assumed they'd be similar.  I was pretty disappointed with Lions since I was expecting a half-day adventure type of experience. It also had a more ""in the middle of the city"" kind of vibe. But I can see its appeal if you got shit to do later in the day and want a quicker, casual float."
Austin,3d1cdz,34215527015,4,Sun Jul 12 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"I loved floating the upper San Marcos when I lived there.  I could just walk 3 blocks, put my tube in, get out 30-45 minutes later, and walk the 3 blocks back home.  No need to pack a cooler or even a dry set of clothes.  Easy to put in after work and still be home in time for supper."
Austin,3d1cdz,sxzxnnx,3,Sun Jul 12 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"My SO and I floated the Comal two weeks ago. It was...okay. It's not my scene. Too many people, too many groups of tubers (hard to navigate around them), and the river's kinda slow.  I loved the Guadalupe, though. I recall it being pretty scenic last time I went there. I think there are grills set up at various spots near the river, so you could always set up in one location, drive a car or two upriver, then float down to your picnic site."
Austin,3d1cdz,vivalakellye,8,Sun Jul 12 19:11:04 2015 UTC,Just floated the Horseshoe yesterday.. first time in several years when the long float was doable.  Usually we have our own tubes but used Tube Haus yesterday.
Austin,3d1cdz,valeyard89,2,Sun Jul 12 18:44:31 2015 UTC,How was Tube Haus? We're looking for somewhere to float on the Guadalupe next weekend and I've heard mixed things about Tube Haus.
Austin,3d1cdz,deathbyxmaslight,2,Sun Jul 12 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"There was a long wait to pay/get tubes when we arrived (20 minutes). $15 to park, float and pickup.  Seems to be the standard price from what other places were charging.  Tube was fine enough, usually we bring our own."
Austin,3d1cdz,valeyard89,3,Mon Jul 13 00:42:58 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the San Marcos float the most recently, it's always steadily flowing and the water is cool but not as cold as the Gudalupe.  I've always used the Lion's Club to rent from."
Austin,3d1cdz,mrsparkleo,2,Sun Jul 12 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"San Marcos is gorgeous, most of the places you see on the river are just humble river homes. The water is nice and cold as well."

Austin,3d1cdz,kelsoATX,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"We've floated a few times over the last several years, but I can't really remember what parts of the river we floated.   Just generally this: Comal - Was kinda short and very urban. Prefer less city/concrete Guadalupe - First time on this river was really cool. Long float, fun people, mix of busy and few.  Remember we had to go around some big rock in the middle of the river?  Haven't found that area since.  Last time, lots of people. San Marcos - Floated this last year, pretty nice... lots of vegetation, clean water.  Not as many people."
Austin,3d1cdz,flyingcars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"I like the Comal because it is short and sweet.

Austin,3cxg1q,yoss250,5,Sun Jul 12 00:27:29 2015 UTC,"The only problem with the DART is not itself but Dallas. Dallas is not a walk-able city by any means. To get to a DART station you need to drive to it and pay for parking, which is understandable since every major city has the same system. But the main problem is when you get off the DART you still need a car to get where you are going because major avenues and highways bisect downtown in every direction. It would be a great system if Dallas was more like Austin and didn't have highways running through the middle of downtown."
Austin,3cxg1q,Zanorfgor,3,Sun Jul 12 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered that about Dallas; most the time where I was going downtown was within a few blocks of the train lines.

Austin,3cxg1q,SomeWhat_funemployed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:42:34 2015 UTC,As of sometime mid-last year most if not all the park and rides are free now at DART stations. Apparently they were losing money on it since people would just park somewhere else and walk to the station.
Austin,3cxg1q,yoss250,2,Sun Jul 12 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah its not the parking that's a problem. I've lived in Chicago and DC, and the metros there have tons of parking on the outskirts of the city. Dallas does too. The problem is, in Dallas, when you get off downtown, you'll probably need a car or taxi to get to your destination. Because the distance was either too great or there was a highway blocking you off.

Austin,3cxg1q,iamnoah,10,Mon Jul 13 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"Upvoted because the idea of rail is the thing holding back public transit in Austin. Everyone insists that rail is the answer, but rail is super expensive.  Good transit is not about rail vs. buses, it's about service. Service in Austin sucks. Most bus routes arrive every 30-40 minutes. If you are trying to go somewhere, that means you have an average wait, in the heat, of 15-20 minutes before you even get on a bus, and if you just missed the bus you are fucked.  Rail on the same schedule would not be any better. All the nice things you think of when you think of rail are actually features we can implement with any transit system. Nice stations? Lets build nice bus stations. Nice cars? Buses can be very nice on the inside. High frequency? Have a bus every 10 minutes. Dedicated lanes? We have them downtown. Take the space you would build tracks in and give it to buses.  Plus, you can move bus lines and add new ones without millions of dollars and years of construction!  So stop dreaming about trains and start demanding good bus service."
Austin,3cxg1q,roflwoffles,2,Sun Jul 12 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"My only criticism is that trains aren't subject to vehicular traffic, so they aren't really the same.  That said, you still make a fair point that should be heard."
Austin,3cxg1q,iamnoah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"If you give the trains reserved guideway (e.g., off-street tracks or tunnels,) you are correct. The hybrid ""light rail"" proposals we have seen in Austin include train tracks that run through town in a ""shared lane."" Cars are supposed to stay out of it except to turn across it, but you know they will block it in traffic. Even worse, cars will occasionally stall in it. A bus could go around, but a train will get stuck until the obstruction is removed.  We can and do give buses their own lane downtown. If you did the same on Lamar, The Drag, and a few other key streets, you could exempt buses from most traffic. My point being, if you find room to build reserved guideway for a train in Austin, you could run buses in the same space. If that space is existing road, all you have to do is add some signs and striping, for far less cost than laying tracks."

The city taxing part of the economic rent wouldn't detract from supply (unlike most taxes), because it's fixed, and would do nothing to affect demand, so...

Austin,3cxg1q,tokyem,3,Sun Jul 12 07:41:44 2015 UTC,Did you forget the /s ?!?
Austin,3cxg1q,turtlekitty2084,2,Sun Jul 12 04:06:20 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Land is generally valued as an income stream - as the economic rent capitalized over a number of years by the interest rate.  If the state is taking part of the rent, this makes it less attractive as an investment, which lowers prices.  This is why homes are more affordable in Texas than California, in areas with similar density and demand - we have the highest property taxes in the nation.  That's also one big reason the crash of 2008 didn't hit Texas as hard as California or Nevada or Florida.  Note that I'm talking about land, not buildings.  Taxing buildings is unfortunate, and raising the general property tax would likely raise rents.  Places in Pennsylvania that have gone from traditional property taxes to a split rate, taxing land higher than buildings, have seen booms in construction.  Not that Austin seems to need much help, in that regard..."
Austin,3cxg1q,tokyem,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"I noted that you were talking about how raising expenses would make prices go down.  Doesn't work like that in real life or in the time horizon of a current owner.  Have you ever owned real estate?  I can tell you from experience that if the government raises taxes, rent prices will go up as much as landlords can increase prices--everyone in the same area is experiencing the same cost (tax) increase so renters get higher prices.    Texas is more affordable than California because the overall tax burden and the costs of compliance with mindless government regulations are lower."
Austin,3cxg1q,turtlekitty2084,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree with that last part, but our property tax system is involved.  The key phrase in your argument above is ""as much as landlords can increase prices"".  What makes you think they won't raise them as high as they can right now?  Not all do, but most do.  Do you think rents would go down if the property tax disappeared tomorrow?*  Or would landlords just enjoy higher profits?  I don't need to convince you that the LVT is a positive good; I'd be satisfied to prove that it's the least harmful of all possible taxes.  I think the evidence shows this.  Getting rid of sales and income taxes would do far more good than any harm that might come from an LVT.  Then we could argue forever about whether it should be 1% or 10%.    Okay, they might... but only because the buildings are no longer taxed."
Austin,3cxg1q,Walking_billboard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"This is the most nonsensical thing I have read in some time. It is foundational incorrect in two key areas; 1) That the supply and demand are fixed. Neither are true as long as there is more land to build. Of which there is plenty in Austin and surrounding areas 2) That landlords will continue to operate against their own self interest. Example: I am a landlord. My taxes jumped for one property rose $4,000 a year to $7,000 a year. This puts me at a net-negative operating margin. I am of the belief that this area is at or approaching it local maximum for growth. The impact of raising my property taxes very likely means I will sell this particular property reducing the number of available rental apartments by 3 (it will likely be bulldozed into a SF home).    Taken a step further, if taxes reach a level where property construction will return a lower margin than, say investing in an Index Fund, the REITS (Which build most of the USA's apartments) will cease to operate. Not only would this cause economic chaos (your grandmas retirement fund keeps a ton of money in REITs) it would obliterate new apartment supply and drive up cost for existing locations."
Austin,3cxg1q,turtlekitty2084,2,Sun Jul 12 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"The supply of land - in the economic sense, meaning all the matter and space on planet Earth - is fixed in supply.  That's just basic physics.  So is the supply of land in any political jurisdiction, unless it is expanding and annexing territory.  The point is that the land in an area is fixed.  Homes and apartments are not, of course.  But that's not what you're talking about.  Yes, we can always encourage urban sprawl and keep building more living space further and further from the city center because everyone's been priced out of the market and driven to the margin.  But this has negative externalities far worse than the externalities suffered by landlords whose taxes go up.  Land value taxation makes land more expensive to hold idle, and thus decreases speculation, and makes land easire to acquire.  It leads to there being fewer renters and more owners.  I wouldn't tax your buildings at all.  As I said elsewhere, places that have uptaxed land and downtaxed buildings have seen construction booms.  This can be verified empirically by looking at places in Pennsylvania, ""Asian Tigers"" like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and numerous others.  Serious question - if the property tax doubled, but buildings were completely exempted, wouldn't you see your taxes go down overall?  I'm not sure how much Austin tends to undervalue land vs structures, but most places do."

By comparison, most of central Austin today is around 5000 persons / sq mile.  The area around UT campus is 11,000 persons / sq mile.  While a full blown subway system is undoubtedly too much, something like the light rail proposal of 2000 I think would be quite viable, especially when you take into account tourist usage."

I just get annoyed when people say we could have a subway/rail system like New Yorks's or London's etc.   It is worth noting one other thing about your numbers; New York City's population in 1904 was 3 times higher than Austins is today.

Austin,3cxg1q,TheRealAlexPKeaton,3,Sun Jul 12 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"If self-driving cars start coming online by 2020 like most car companies and experts are predicting, I think that it's very likely that manual driving will be outlawed except in controlled areas by 2040, similar to horseback riding today.   That may sound crazy to outlaw manual driving, but if self-driving cars eliminate accidents and traffic, imagine how crazy our current system is of putting our lives into strangers' hands every time we walk or drive down the street, or wasting our lives in gridlock traffic.  I think public transportation will still exist, but in the form of various sizes of electric car or van-like vehicles that get people point-to-point in a much more efficient manner than a bus or train going the same way every day. We can subsidize it for the poor in any number of ways, but it will be much more efficient, nimble, and scalable than spending billions on rail."

Austin,3cxg1q,afraid_of_sharting,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:30:12 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks the urban environment is way too complex for self-driving cars to work as well as people like /u/TheRealAlexPKeaton claim they will? Sort of like how highways and flyovers haven't fulfilled the visions of Le Corbusier and Robert Moses? Also I feel like the lag from where we are now to transitioning to an entirely new fleet of cars will take much longer than 15 years.
Austin,3cxg1q,longhornbicyclist,3,Sun Jul 12 14:24:19 2015 UTC,I used the DART system in Dallas a couple weeks ago and it was amazing!  I would kill for such a system in Austin
Austin,3cxg1q,reuterrat,3,Mon Jul 13 17:44:49 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's just a connect-the-dots of the various Subway sandwich locations around Austin.
Austin,3cxg1q,dsteelenet,23,Mon Jul 13 19:45:07 2015 UTC,Say hello to my friend limestone when trying to build this thing.
Austin,3cxg1q,klew3,45,Sat Jul 11 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"Limestone is indeed your friend. Sure it can be hard in places but it's more stable which requires less reinforcing work while mining through and less long term stabilization efforts leading to lower costs. It would be an absolute dream to have 100% limestone along these routes.  The problem arises in boundaries where you have rock meeting clay or shale which require different means of excavation and support. Not easy when you're 100' below ground with crews trained for and used to specific circumstances, also machines purposed for specific materials."
Austin,3cxg1q,scroatmeal,15,Mon Jul 13 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"Sure it can be hard in places   I wouldn't even concede that point.  Limestone is made of calcite, which has a hardness of 3 on Moh's hardness scale.  Granted, it's harder than a fingernail, but not by much.  Grinding it up isn't an issue.  Hauling is pretty much the same for any material.  Clays would be much more problematic due to their swelling properties, generally speaking."
Austin,3cxg1q,49catsinarainbarrell,25,Sat Jul 11 18:13:01 2015 UTC,Limestone is soft as rock goes.  Plenty of other cities (NY for example) have tunneled subway systems through much  harder rock.
Austin,3cxg1q,thatguy50,23,Sat Jul 11 19:54:42 2015 UTC,Limestone is soft as rock goes.    Like Hall & Oates soft?

Austin,3cxg1q,Dubax,18,Sun Jul 12 01:36:41 2015 UTC,"I never understood this... limestone is one of the softest rocks, yet I keep hearing that it's the reason we can't have subways.  Despite that, we just dug a tunnel to send a creek through.  What gives?"
Austin,3cxg1q,3jt,8,Sun Jul 12 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it was only a mile long. You can't dig further than that or you'll fall off the edge of the world."

Austin,3cxg1q,rednoise,7,Sat Jul 11 18:33:48 2015 UTC,Ground tracks would cause LOTS of delays....  having to cross over existing streets and all.
Austin,3cxg1q,HookDragger,8,Sat Jul 11 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"I've been to more than several cities with light rail systems, and lived in one for an extended period of time. The delays caused by trains is minimal and amounts to maybe sitting at a red light for half a minute longer. It's not an issue at all.  What is going to cause longer delays is the continued encouragement of using cars to commute in and out of downtown, and the constant and wasteful expansion of the roads in lieu of a robust transportation system."
Austin,3cxg1q,happywaffle,4,Sat Jul 11 18:41:22 2015 UTC,I'm not saying to encourage it... just don't put rail-road tracks in front of already massively congested roads.... an elevated system would be better.
Austin,3cxg1q,HookDragger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:06 2015 UTC,An elevated system would be too expensive. A ground system in the right place would be fine. Go visit any city that has one.

Prop 1 was a perfect example of this.  What we need is to take a deep breath, put on our collective big-boy pants, and build a system that (gasp) does cause traffic issues. A light rail down the center of Lamar and Guadalupe is almost certainly the best option. It'll make driving more inconvenient, but it'll make NOT driving a lot more convenient. That's the only way to put a dent in traffic: provide a real, viable alternative."

Austin,3cxg1q,thismatters,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"The real reason we won't see any sort of subway system like this or even any solid public transit is austins lack of population density.  Yeah, it'd be neat if we had a system like New York City, but we're talking about a town with a metropolitan population just shy of 2 million people.  NYC has around 20 million people.  Chicago has shy of 10 million people.  Something like Light Rail might be better for Austin, but the first question to ask is, do the buses even cover the city well enough?  Light Rail lines would just mimic bus lines but have a higher capacity of passengers they could carry.  If the rail lines were separated from vehicle traffic they could go from A to B quicker too."
Austin,3cxg1q,shut_up_josh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:33:06 2015 UTC,Light rail causes delays in surface traffic which has a net negative effect. Hell I've been stopped by a phantom train on MLK many times and nothing an make me hate public transportation more than that.

We had two nalgenes full of water in addition to some granola bars and an extra bottle of water ""just in case."" We started hiking around noon and because of bugs, were wearing longer hiking pants and long-sleeve shirts.   We got lost, quickly ran out of water, and it wasn't until 4 pm that we began making our way back down the rock slide. We were delirious, heavily dehydrated, and I ended up vomiting and passing out at the bottom of the rock climb. My friend somehow ran back across the creek and found a family that was having a picnic there. They didn't speak English, but they could understand ""help."" One of the men and one of the little girls who could speak a little English went back into the woods to find me.   40 minutes later they did, half carried me back, and at that point began hydrating us. They gave us water, an entire watermelon, coconut water, oranges, and a coke. One of the men dipped some towels in the cooler's ice water and then wrapped us in the towels. They stayed with us until we recovered and then quietly left after we tried to pay them for their help. I will never forget that family. They saved our lives that day.   Be prepared out there and take care of each other - enjoying our environment is wonderful, but things can get scary quicker than we think."

I have a followup question, of sorts, to my previous post.  I was finally able to apply for a new driver's license on July 3rd, as I had the day off and the license office was actually open. I had to surrender my out of state license and was given a print-out temporary license. I will be flying (domestically, if that matters) in about two weeks. My passport expired back in January.   Will I be able to fly with my temporary license if my new license doesn't arrive in time? What if something happens to that piece of paper?"

Austin,3cznnc,comoxbc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"good points.  Weather, yep. Culture, definitely SF, Seattle, Portland for hippie and hipsterish and liberal mindset.  I've heard Houston has a wide range of food.  Jobs, besides tech, I see typical state capital type jobs ( professionals, lobbyists, and state employees ).    There's Texas-ness like other Texas cities ( I think tourists who come for music don't see it since they are in ACLimits ) but it's there.  The college feel is definitely similar to any large, or small for that matter, college town - where there's large percentages of younger people, and that also links to the liberal mindset.  I sometimes wonder I enjoy most here - I think at the end of the day, the college town feel bleeds into everything else people may notice or like about Austin - music, laid back, hippie, liberal, being outdoors.  So examples like Boulder, Boston, Knoxville, Madison.  I was raised in Baltimore- there's elements of Baltimore's quirkiness and artist/music scene that I see here too."

Austin,3cznnc,comoxbc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"I personally haven't watched it as much. I used to watch Homicide, Life on the Street before that.  In general, both shows are pretty accurate in terms of the strife and economic imbalance of Baltimore.   A commentary after the recent riots captured it correctly - higher pay jobs and wealth moved out of Baltimore a long time ago for the most part, so industry/business does not think it's worth to invest in basic goods and services and build in the city ( except for the tourist areas and pockets of upper class areas ). Therefore, it's tragic for any lower income person living there - they can't even get the basics.    I'm biased, but I recommend a trip to Baltimore for you and anyone I meet - it's definitely unique.  Interesting areas I was thinking about, that remind me of Austin in a way, are Hampden ( John Waters territory ), Mount Vernon ( the art school is there ), Fells Point ( on the water ), Roland Park ( I lived there, and where Accidental Tourist, Diner, and other Baltimore-inspired movies are filmed ). Near Johns Hopkins University and Loyola University ( the college town piece that reminds me a bit of Austin ) Don't spend too much time or rate Baltimore for the downtown inner harbor, which are tourist areas.  Except a baseball game at Camden Yards."
Austin,3cznnc,iliveintexas,2,Sun Jul 12 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"It's one of the best shows (IMO) to ever come on television. Obama interviewed The Wire's creator earlier this year.  It's both interesting and unfortunate to me that a city reach that state, given its close proximity to Washington D.C. I thought Jon Stewart's criticism of CNN giving more importance to the White House Correspondents dinner over the Baltimore riots (which took place on the same night) was a particularly well-done metaphor for the disparity in news coverage of the wealthy vs the poor.  Speaking of a small world, I actually got accepted into John Hopkins a decade ago when I was applying to colleges, but ultimately chose to stay in Texas to be closer to family."

Our monthly payment is $1200 but we pay $1400/month to lower the PMI more quickly.  It's doable for sure, and you don't need to go to the suburbs or get an FHA loan to do it, but you need to be able to do it quickly if you want to buy in the city. At least this time last year, there were still plenty of houses under $200k in Dove Springs/SE Austin, Rundberg, Quail Creek, Walnut Creek areas. If you want north, I recommend looking everywhere between Mopac, 183, Dessau, and Parmer. Lots of bigger houses with good bones up here."
Austin,3cznnc,justscottaustin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:32:25 2015 UTC,"At 4%, your monthly payments on $185k with everything rolled in are going to be right under $2k/month. That includes taxes, PMI, insurance, payments, etc.  So...there you go."
Austin,3cznnc,squirrel-bait,0,Sun Jul 12 13:44:22 2015 UTC,"Dude, do you even math?  On a 185K house, your payments will be close to $1000, insurance is around $100~150, PMI is also under $100, and taxes, basing off the average around $300.  Which means you're look at $1,500 a month, most if which is the property tax, which you can challenge.  Also, considering that, yes, right now anything around $200,000 is you mostly just buying the land, you get a pick of property and take out a 203K FHA re-hab loan.  Get yourself a solid house, fix it up, well worth it.  edit: words and shit"
Austin,3cznnc,justscottaustin,6,Sun Jul 12 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Dude. I have a mortgage refinance at 185 @ 4%. With the escrow account, you'll be paying 1800/mo.  Source: Every month. What I pay.  I said 2k because it makes sense to plan a 10% buffer."
Austin,3cznnc,squirrel-bait,2,Sun Jul 12 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"over a 30 year mortgage?  how much interest did you accumulate before the refinance?   A=P+Prt, so let's say you buy 185K house, PMI is generally around $3.5K, insurance is around 1k a year and property taxes are nearing close to 2% in austin, so let's say 2K a year.  So, (191.5K+ 191.5x.04 x 30)/360 (monthly payments over 30 years) = $1516"
Austin,3cznnc,justscottaustin,4,Sun Jul 12 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"There's the disconnect. Property taxes are nowhere near 2k for 185 in central TX. I am not even in the city, proper, in Wilco rather than Travis, and mine are 4k+. Most homeowners I know would trade places with me in a second for 4k/yr, too.  There's your extra  $200 ish per month."

Austin,3cznnc,justscottaustin,3,Sun Jul 12 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"The appraised value of the house is $230something. 3% of 230 would be 7600ish. And your math is off. 3% of 185,000 would be $5,550. Where does $4k become of 4% 185,000?"

Austin,3cznnc,openfootinsertmouth,2,Sun Jul 12 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"Round Rock and Pflugerville were established in the mid 19th century, but it was around the mid-late 20th century that these areas started becoming known as suburbs. I'm pretty sure it's the same case for lots of areas across the US, since this was after WWII and the baby boomers were growing up and starting their own families. Population was exploding.   Like most of the major Texas metros, the core is surrounded by dozens of small separate towns which all grew into each other over time but were never incorporated into the main city. They were their own separate municipalities back then, and still are today, with their own separate town centers and historic districts. Four decades ago, what we now call the Domain was out in the middle of nowhere, and Mopac was a dirt patch. The parts that you see bleeding together are just run of the mill suburbia... strip malls, subdivisions, and toll roads. The highways are overseen by a regional authority, and of course the strip malls and subdivisions are put in by national corporate conglomerates, so everything looks homogenized in these ""in between"" parts."

Austin,3cznnc,OakHillFella,3,Sun Jul 12 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"For a condo, it's possible. Looking at the under $300K price range, the average condo on the market or sold in 78702 this year was for $250K. And that typically gets you a newer 1 bed, 1 bath at approximately 900 square feet. If prices in that area for a condo appreciate 10% over the next two years, that is an average price of $275K by the time you're looking to buy. Keep in mind that this price range only makes up a third of the condo market in '02.   As for a single family home, I highly doubt it, barring some kind of real estate price crash. Much of the market under $300K in central east is homes needing extensive remodeling or tear downs being marketed to investors. It's why a quarter of homes in the area are new homes built in the last year."

Currently, I'm leaning towards this particular place called Chez Moi. It has some of the better reviews, and I'm unable to go down there to check it out until I actually move down and by then it'll be too late. Does anyone here have any experience with this place?

I don't particularly have anything against ""processed foods"" in general like a lot of the ""food activists"" you'll be accosted by while on a medical diet, but I do find processed foods annoying because I have to look into every mystery ingredient on the label -- like what the fuck is polysorbate 80? What the hell is carrageenan? I know a lot of them by heart now, but I have sat in the aisles at HEB trying to google this shit on my phone with shitty indoor reception way too many times.   I pretty much only cook for myself these days, with very few exceptions. I still go to BBQ places and eat plain brisket, but that's about it, and even then I'm kinda paranoid about what some places may put in the rub. Oh, and Whataburger rules because I can order burger patties for $1.50 each. It appears on the receipt as ""LARGE MEAT.""  It sucks but I guess I'm just trying to hold out until better treatment options are available.   I know none of that helps your situation, just empathizing with you. Being on a strict exclusionary medical diet is tough, which is why people so frequently fail at it. Takes way more discipline than most people have.   PS fuck all these uncompassionate assholes who are downvoting your post."

Austin,3cxir6,Pleroo,10,Sun Jul 12 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"I was a cook at Casino for five years. Every shift I started off in a great mood, and within a couple hours I was ground down to a nub. The kitchen was ran by two people, max. That's one guy doing all of the food and one guy dealing with all of the customers. On Mondays and Tuesdays I would usually work by myself, doing all the cooking, prep, dishes(by hand, no machine.) and taking all orders. Between tourists who saw us on DDD(I still haven't seen the episode, so never know what people are trying to reference) and slews of drunks, you take a lot of shit. The owner expects the cooks to be as polite as you can be, but it isn't the kind of place where you have to kiss people's ass or get fired. If someone is a dick, you can be a dick right back. If you go, and I encourage you to the burger is the best IMHO, keep in mind the cooks have a lot going on and don't have time to play 20 questions. Do your homework beforehand, know what you want and be nice and everything will probably be fine. Stupid questions were the bane of my existence when I worked there and here are the top 10 dumbest questions I got: 1) what did guy fieri order? Didn't see the episode, don't care just tell me what you want. You watched it, you tell me. 2) how hot is your hot? What do you mean, in scoville units? It's fucking hot I don't know how to explain it to you in words. It's delicious burny mouth pain. 3) don't you have a regular cheeseburger? No. We have a menu, or you can make your own. Every single person has a different idea of what a regular cheeseburger is so why don't you just tell me what you want. 4) do you have onion rings? No. We have a menu. If it's not on there we don't have it. 5) where do I get my drinks? That long thing you walked past to get to me, the one with all the bottles behind it that's called a bar. They make drinks. 6) it says your hot dog is a quarter pound. How much is that? Seriously? It's 4 ounces. Are you daft? 7) why don't you guys have a veggie burger? Because we have real food. Seriously no one makes a veggie burger this awesome. 8) do you know where to get ______ (insert illegal drug here). Yes now get the fuck out of my bar before I call the cops. 9) my girlfriend is throwing up because she's too drunk can I get a refund? Nope. No refunds for any reason ever. 10) why are you so rude? Because I have to talk to people like you all day"

Austin,3cxir6,Chemspiration,2,Sun Jul 12 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"Just so you are aware, the line situation you see at every hop doddy is a marketing scheme.

I'm not going to go into detail, but this is the second time in a row that that place has fucked up and I'll say that I won't be eating another burger from CEC again. On a happy note; I had a burger from Phil's Ice House on Burnet (right next to Amy's) and it was actually really, really good."
Austin,3cxir6,turtlekitty2084,3,Sat Jul 11 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"About six or seven years ago I would have fought anyone who didn't agree that Casino El Camino burgers were the best in town. Not any more. In fact, the last time I was there was about five years ago. I'm not gonna say what I think contributed to this place's demise, but his name rhymes with pie topiary. It was great for Casino himself (and I am sincerely happy for him), but for the long time regulars who loved the food, drink and atmosphere, it was the kiss of death."

Friend of mine went in early one Saturday and saw an entire little girl's soccer team. ^_^  That economic boost might have been what allowed the creation of Casino Southside, though, and I <3 that place even without the food."

Now Jackalope is my go to place, though I usually only go there after work and not in the evenings.  Funny thing about Jackalope, I remember way back when talking to someone behind the bar and he was saying how Casino was worried that his regulars were all going to jump ship and start frequenting Jlope. Funny how that worked out."
Austin,3cxir6,Pleroo,3,Sat Jul 11 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"I distinctly remember one of the last times I went there, many years ago. It was late afternoon and I was walking down sixth behind a family of 4, parents and two kids under 10.   As we got closer and closer to Casino I was getting the feeling they were headed to the bar. Sure enough, they approach the doorway and then turn to go in. At this point I was right behind them and rather shocked (this was soon after the diners drive ins thing that I hadn't heard about yet). As soon as they walked in, the dad said, ""oh, this is like a bar, bar."" Lifto was behind the bar towards the back and roared, ""No children!"" The family turned right around and left. It was awesome."

They must do something right.    Hut's makes bad burgers, and doesn't know when to stop rebuilding on creekflood central. I don't care that they are old.  Dan's isn't really even known for their burgers anymore, but their breakfast, and Top Notch was recently sold to the Galaxy Cafe group.  Regardless, in the fast food burger group that those two belong in, I would rather hit up Hilberts, also an Austin Original."

Austin,3d0l60,hungryhungryME,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:34:20 2015 UTC,It depends on who you get at the DMV.  One dude gave me a replacement and all I had was a voter registration card and a bunch of things addressed to me which were nothing.  Website said I needed more but he let it slide.  I'm sure others aren't as lenient.  I've had my birth certificate the other times i've done it tho.

Austin,3cxm2z,DrMaloo,7,Sat Jul 11 19:01:01 2015 UTC,Imgur Done. Also the number on the taillight is: SAE (2)AIP2RS(2)T 04 LX/C-HP (chrysler symbol)  EDIT - Chrysler 300 it is... I'll be on the lookout.
Austin,3cxm2z,spiderPikachu,15,Sat Jul 11 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"That taillight is from a Chrysler 300 Link  I'm learning towards it being a 2005-2006 but the range for that tail light looks to be 2005-2010. All political correctness aside, the early year 300's are popular in lower income demographic areas and a further generalization is that these cars are somewhat common in East Austin."

Check the Austin Animal Center’s Twitter account @austinanimals. The @austinanimals Twitter account is updated every 30 minutes with stray pets that have recently entered the shelter.  Come to the Animal Center to look for your lost pet as soon as possible. Due to the large number of animals, some may be held for only three days after intake. It is recommended you visit the shelter at least every other day to check for your lost pet.  Between shelter visits, search an online database of lost animals that are in the shelter. This is not as reliable as visiting the shelter in person and is not a substitute for visiting the shelter. This map shows all stray cats and dogs that are currently in AAC's care for no longer than a week. The Image column has a link to the animal's most up-to-date image.  Found Pets  Most stray animals are owned by someone. Don’t keep an animal that you find without first making a real effort to locate the owner. Talk to neighbors and post signs.  If you can keep the found pet temporarily, call or contact 3-1-1 online to submit a Found Animal Report.  If you bring in a found pet, please provide info about where and when it was found.  If you have found a stray pet and cannot bring it to the shelter, contact 3-1-1. Animal Protection should be able to pick it up.  Open Intake Shelter  The Austin Animal Center is an open-intake animal shelter serving the City of Austin and Travis County. It accepts any animal that needs shelter, regardless of age, health, species, breed or behavior, and no matter whether it is a stray or an owned animal.  If you find your pet:  As a Travis County Resident, you can get a free microchip and ID tag for your pet. If your pet is not microchipped and/or does not have an ID tag, please come down to Austin Animal Services during the hours of 11am to 7pm to get a free microchip and/or ID tag for your pet.  http://austintexas.gov/department/lost-found-pet  /r/Austin/wiki/FAQ  http://austin.craigslist.org/search/laf"

The walking trail which goes into the woods (to the right as you pull in) isn't as populated. There's some neighborhoods nearby so dog walkers, joggers and bikers happen but it's not crazy most times I go. Usually between 9a-11a. I usually see 5 people on the trail when I go out there for an hour.  I usually take my dog out there with a long lead (50 ft) to work with her. She's very independent and easily distracted. There's two large fields near the east parts of the park, closest to the neighborhood. Look at the satellite view and you'll see what I mean. It's a wide open area with no fences. There's some good spots to let the pup get in the water, too. Take the trail south from the baseball field and take the left fork. There is a fair bit of wildlife and occasional horseback riders. I've seen large turtles, coyotes, deer, squirrel, roadrunners and armadillos back there. It can get a little confusing with the trails your first time out. I'd suggest printing the satellite view of the map or taking your phone until you get used to the trails."

Plus there are trees and soft grass to play in.  Win/win
Austin,3cx6oh,BipolarUnipolar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"Try going to auditorium shores after sun down! With a buddy of course. My dog is also socially awkward with other more enthusiastic dogs, and I keep her on leash 99% of the time to avoid any bad interactions with other dogs (and children, she's a large dog but extremely insecure and doesn't like kids).   It is often pretty empty and you may only see a couple other dogs, and I just move to another section of the field where they aren't right close by. My dog loves to run around and this has been the safest place so far I've found to do so."

The one in Austin never seemed to have quite the same charm. It had a neat location on Riverside west of I-35 (Joe's Crab Shack now? and was Landry's for a while), but at the time it closed, it wasn't such a great location for a business like that."

Austin,3ct21o,SycoJack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"I feel as though our memories aren't that deceptive. That food quality has gone down considerably.   The cost of fuel skyrocketing also caused the cost of food to skyrocket. Many places began to use cheaper ingredients I suspect.   For example, I seem to recall chicken fried steaks being actual steak. Now most of the time it's ""beef product."""

Austin,3ct21o,adrianmonk,2,Fri Jul 10 17:00:52 2015 UTC,It's actually Dalt's and it's a chain restaurant that's still around outside Texas. I remember going to one in Dallas as a kid.
Austin,3ct21o,stay_for_tea_and_fun,2,Fri Jul 10 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"That'd be Dalts with an ""L"". At least if it's the same thing as the hamburger place that used to be in Dallas.  There was an El Torito in Austin at one point. I can't remember exactly where, but it might've been near Highland Mall (possibly on the other side of I-35). But they were a large chain at one point, so there might've been one in Houston too."

They had locations all over the place (Lakeline Mall, 183 and Burnet, and 2 or 3 others in Austin), and they all seemed to do a pretty good, steady business. Then suddenly like 75% of their locations closed, and a few others hung on for a while and then they disappeared too. Considering that they closed down while still relatively popular, it seemed like someone had to have screwed something up big time."

However, this is a good option for me to consider, I also need to figure out what traffic to the Triangle would be like seeing as I'd be taking Mopac northbound from 290 up there. I know that the construction has added on to commute time compared to a few years back. It seems like there is never a window without some kind of traffic build up whenever I've been on Mopac lately.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll have to look more into it!"
Austin,3cynlq,Etherg8,3,Sun Jul 12 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"I assume you're coming from southwest, like Oak Hill or farther?  Getting through town all the way to the triangle and then back to downtown would be counter-intuitive.  If you lived north of downtown, it would make perfect sense -- It's about 15 min on the 801 rapid from the triangle to downtown.  The only real downside to that trip is the bus is packed full of UT kids -- It's like a sardine can until the West Mall station.  Given the general vicinity of 290/Mopac, it would probably make more sense to park at the Oak Hill Park And Ride and take the 171 into downtown, which is about a 20 minute ride according to the time tables.  Fair warning: I've not used this route, and I'm not sure what that park and ride has for available capacity, but it looks like a potentially good option."
Austin,3cynlq,TsarKartoshka,2,Sun Jul 12 07:03:42 2015 UTC,"Note that the 171 only makes 8 trips per weekday -- Oak Hill departures are 6:00-8:20 and at 1:20, and downtown departures are 12:30 and 3:40-6:00.  I think OP requires a later return trip than 6pm. It's not impossible to get to the Oak Hill Park and Ride that late, but it would be much longer: you'd have to take a local bus down to Wm Cannon and transfer to 333, which Google Maps thinks would be about 90 minutes.  Does South Congress Transit Center have parking available? It's right on 290 and Google Maps shows it to be less than 30 minutes from downtown at rush hour. I see a small lot on street view, but I can't tell if it's legal to park there."
Austin,3cynlq,mercuric5i2,2,Sun Jul 12 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Your best public transit option is going to be the 803 from the Westgate station (near 290/71/360). Park on Sagebrush Trail directly South of the Westgate station. The 803 from there will probably take a bit under 30 minutes from Westgate to 8th & Lavaca.  The benefit of the 803 wouldn't be as great for you as it would be if you were working farther north, because the bus-only lanes start around 3rd and go almost all the way to MLK. But, I can assure you on busy days, getting onto MoPac South or going down Lamar from that area is really, really shitty. The 803 provides the benefit of a clean & new bus with A/C and Wifi, and you could space out or read for that stretch of your commute.  Taking the 803 from Westgate would make your commute less expensive and would spare you from driving the most aggravating stretch of that commute."

Both directions are an easy paddle and the lake usually has a VERY mild current. Perfect for beginners, but not yawn-worthy for novices or folks with a few more strokes behind their paddles. I'll most likely be out on the lake tomorrow, enjoy yourselves! ( P.S. Don't forget to bring some water to stay hydrated on the lake- you work up quite the thirst if heading out mid-day. Also bring a length of rope in case you want to tie off and dock someplace.

Austin,3cuv03,half-star,3,Sat Jul 11 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"That's the best way to just go to Franklin to get something but at those times usually all they have left is sausage and chopped beef. I lucked out last time and they had some pulled pork left too.  On the plus side at the end of the day they're just trying to get rid of everything so they gave me like 6 links and probably 2/3lb each of chopped beef and pulled pork for $13 (they just threw whatever they wanted into the order - I call it ""Franklin Roulette""). One time my girlfriend and I hit the jackpot and it was a crazy day were they had a ton of brisket left. We asked for 2 additional pounds to go after we finished eating and they ended up giving us a 4.5 pound slab. Best. Day. Ever.  Huge gamble if the brisket (or ribs, or turkey) is important to you.  Edit: it's also pretty rare for there to be more than 2-3 folks there before 6:30. It starts to crowd up beginning at 7 most mornings.

Right now the watermelon gazpacho, the green chili Mac & cheese and the pulled pork with tomato soup on the seasonal menu are pretty damn good."

Austin,3cv04n,Butthooker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"Every table service restaurant in America will process separate payments. Separate checks are unnecessary. It used to be important back in the day when people needed to hand in paper receipts for expense reports, but those are now filed electronically and specific to the credit card used.

Austin,3cv04n,jeffjones22,5,Sat Jul 11 04:40:33 2015 UTC,"I don't expect on point service.  I expect that if I arrive 30 minutes early, they take my order BEFORE the show starts.  I expect that if I order a beer, it takes less than 20 minutes to get to me.  I expect that when I order appetizers, they come before the entrees, not after.  And finally, I expect that my burger be delivered at the same time as my wife's pizza, not 15 minutes later (and cold).  I don't think these expectations are unreasonable, even at Alamo."

I think there aren't enough mexicans here though lol  As well, that kinda depends on the definition of Tex Mex. Like I order things like carne guisada and ceviche, tamales and all that, not exactly enchiladas and fajitas - is that Mexican food? is that Tex-Mex? eh either way, it was great in San Antonio and Houston and a little less great here, or maybe my expectations were too high because everything else is top notch.   While in this thread I'll say that the ""French Quarter Grille"" goes down as 'worst place in town' for me.

It was one of the first places in Austin that served (nominally) Mexican food to a mixed clientele, and being so close to the University, it was often the first Mexican food a lot of white people in the 1950's had ever had. They're kinda of hemmed in by tradition and their returning patron's memories and expectations; I mean, they literally still serve saltines with their salsa instead of tortilla chips.

Austin,3cw4mq,longboardluv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:19:12 2015 UTC,"We did camp on the field.   There were a ton of gnats and a few June bugs, but the most amazing bug was a giant water bug. I'm not kidding. That's what it's called. It looks like a big cockroach with pitchers. After the girls saw that, every little thing was a bug coming to get them. But it was fun.   Do you have kids? They do the campouts for girl scouts and boy scouts. Last year, they did a family one as well."

Austin,3csu1r,pecosmonster,2,Fri Jul 10 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"As a barber that has worked at franchise and local shops you can literally get that cut at any shop that has mostly male clients. I cut this style at least 12 times a day, the other common look is similar to this but A tighter, low fade."
Austin,3csu1r,MrWhistles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"Cool. You should only charge $3.50 to give that cut, though. You actually charge too much. I have a friend that will cut your hair for $3.50 so that's all you should charge. They pay attention to detail and they love cutting hair."
Austin,3csu1r,pecosmonster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"Haha!! Nice try on trying to make a point. I don't charge anything actually, the barbershop I work for charges for the service not me. That is different from a guy that is charging $50 for a cut that can be done by nearly any other barbershop for more than half off his price. I actually have worked with barbers from other countries and they have charged $3.50 in their home country. Plus I like I said I love what I do so if you want to only $3.50 for a cut well then, come over and I'll give you a cut for $3.50."

Austin,3csu1r,ronearc,2,Fri Jul 10 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"$50, and all you get is a very good haircut.   No shampoo, no massage, no beer (actually he always has asked if I wanted something to drink, I always say water...), but otherwise, it's not about extras or amenities. It's just a haircut by a skilled artisan.   Edit: The deluxe cut, with shampoo and what-not is $10 more."

Austin,3csu1r,dnthsslethehoff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"I know another person that goes to him and swears by it, so I'm not denying if it's worth it or not. I'm just saying that I personally I wouldn't spend that much on a haircut because I have other things that I would much rather spend the the difference between what I pay and what he charges. That's all."
Austin,3csu1r,ronearc,2,Fri Jul 10 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"I totally get that.   I suppose my point is, haircuts, like many other aspects of the fashion industries, come in definable levels of quality that are not easily spotted by those who aren't ""in the know"" for that industry.   So I would imagine it's frustrating all around when someone finds a photo of a $60-75 haircut (or much more in a high fashion, high price market, like NYC), and then they want that haircut duplicated effectively at $15-20 prices.   Kind of like how people take a look at a ""dress shoe"" that is $80 and don't understand why someone would bother paying $400 for a pair of Allen Edmonds shoes."
Austin,3csu1r,pecosmonster,3,Fri Jul 10 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"Your not really paying for the hair, at those prices your paying for his company. I have friends who usually pay up the ass for their haircuts and when they need a quick cut because their barber is booked they ask me to cut it. They will come over and I can give them the exact cut they got, I will look at the cut beforehand to see if there was any special wizardry going on...nope. People like the fancy place, the ""special"" treatment they get from a barber that charges $50 and up. I work in a place where we do take our time and I personally make sure every fade or cut I do looks sharp as hell, but I would NEVER feel comfortable charging more than $25 for a cut. I LOVE what I do and I don't need to charge an insane amount of money to prove I'm a badass barber."
Austin,3csu1r,ronearc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"I understand.   I do think a certain amount of it is defined by the market in which you compete. Fisher is always booked 4-5 weeks out. If he can keep his chair full at those prices and the customer is happy with the product, then more power to him."
Austin,3csu1r,apathy2007,3,Fri Jul 10 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's an inflated sense of ego, though. The cut in itself is not superior. At some point, you have to acknowledge that you pay a premium because that's where you derive your value and self-worth from - just like people who feel the need to wear marked-up, designer clothes. If it makes you feel better about yourself, then I guess it's worth the money, I just can't relate with that."
Austin,3csu1r,dnthsslethehoff,3,Sat Jul 11 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"I get that you get what you pay for. But comparing shoes to haircuts to shoes is, excuse my idiom, comparing apples to oranges. A $50-70 haircut lasts you on average 3-4 weeks (6 weeks if you go in for a trim). A good pair of $400 dollar pair of shoes or boots should last you years upwards to decades if maintained."
Austin,3csu1r,kelsoATX,3,Fri Jul 10 20:58:42 2015 UTC,People pay money for these haircuts?
Austin,3csu1r,ronearc,3,Fri Jul 10 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"R Todd Fisher's work isn't for everyone. There are a lot of people who wouldn't pay money for a haircut like these, but I happily do so."
Austin,3csu1r,kelsoATX,2,Fri Jul 10 19:43:10 2015 UTC,Those are traditional men's cuts that never go out of style.  Looks like he does really good work but $50 is kinda steep.
Austin,3csu1r,dnthsslethehoff,2,Fri Jul 10 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"I guess so. None of those pictures are of me, so I don't get what point you're trying to make?

They're not all bad but some of those are truly hideous and saving someone from a haircut that they'll be mortified by in photos later in life is useful and educational.

Guy who cut my hair there told me he fixes a couple of Bird's cuts every week. Also, the cutters at Bird's are not barbers — they're stylists, and there's a world of difference. I now go to Wooten on the Drag because I can get in w/o a 90-min. wait. Grant Gomez is my MVP.   tl/dnr: Bird's can eat a big bag of dicks."

Austin,3csu1r,pecosmonster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"Yes he would, because the name/branding has clout. The product does not live up, unfortunately. I have had better cuts at Supercuts than Birds. It doesn't take a hipster to know how to cut hair well."
Austin,3csu1r,ElJefe54,3,Sat Jul 11 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience. Went to Bird's thinking it was a barber shop (was new in town at the time), asked to see a barber and was told there were no appts available and that I'd have to come back in to schedule for the next day. Walked down to Avenue and haven't looked back since. The wait at Avenue can be a bit much sometimes, but overall the cut is well worth it. Seriously irks me that they market themselves as a barber shop when they have (Maybe) 1-2 barbers on staff across all 7 locations, no shaves / straight razor at all, no facial hair service, and predominantly stylists on staff.   I've said this time and again, Bird's is NOT a barber shop."
Austin,3csu1r,pecosmonster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"Technically it IS a barbershop because they have a barbershop license. Not all barbershops do straight razor shaves. I worked at a barbershop that did nothing but cuts, didn't make it any less of a barbershop. We did do straight razor tapper fades though."
Austin,3csu1r,mawarren88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"Right, it's a barbershop because in the state of TX you only have to possess a barbershop license and employ at least one barber to rightfully call yourself as such. I get that. Still a long way from being a barbershop though when 95% of your cutting staff are stylists. By legal definition it may fall under what a barbershop may be defined as, but by traditional standards it's a salon.  Edit: words"
Austin,3csu1r,jimbonics,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. A lot of stylist though work in barbershops and do ""barbershop"" services like straight razor shaves even though they do not have a license for it. Anyway, there are not many Barber schools  in this area, and the ones that are usually have a waiting list, plus they can be pretty pricey. Which is why it's harder to find licensed barbers vs stylists."
Austin,3csu1r,dondo09,2,Fri Jul 10 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Not true, some are stylist some are barbers and some like me have BOTH licenses. I would never work at Birds though, I've heard bad things from former employees. Technically it IS a barbershop since they have a barbershop license."

What's even more agitating when funds that were given for this effort are ""almost out"". When you vote for funds, we expect them to encompass the entire lifecycle of the project."
Austin,3cpkhu,just_an_austinite,28,Thu Jul 9 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. We have insane amounts of people moving to the city, yet barely any public transportation to speak of and now apparently half the sidewalks that we should. Where the heck are taxes going? Edit: In fact, aren't city budgets a matter of public record? Seems like it should be easy to look up this income disparity and find out what is going on."
Austin,3cpkhu,porthius,16,Thu Jul 9 20:51:38 2015 UTC,Bear in mind that the city only gets roughly 20% of your property taxes. And many city functions scale with population. For example 70% of city taxes go to public safety. More people means more police so they don't gain much ground.   That being said I think a more detailed look at revenue growth would be very interesting to me.
Austin,3cpkhu,maracle6,7,Fri Jul 10 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"Just something I remember when I was living in Austin, most people I know didn't want public transportation. There's a big negative stigma associated with anything that isn't your own car in the US especially in places like Texas. Furthermore most large U.S. Cities aren't set up for things like light or heavy rail. To build good public transportation we'd need a cultural shift and entire redesign of cities and suburbs."
Austin,3cpkhu,narakusdemon88,10,Fri Jul 10 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"It's a self fulfilling prophecy. The perception is that only poor people, social rejects, etc ride the bus...therefore only poor people and social rejects ride the bus.  So what has to come first? A cultural shift, or more public transportation? i.e. top down or bottom up?  I think you have to grab hold of good opportunities to force the change. Take a city like Austin, where the #1 complaint of a lot of citizens is traffic, and give them an awesome public transportation system. Then you will force the change in culture/mindset because people will value the extra time over and above their stigma of public transportation.  If it's always easy for them to hop in their car, briskly drive to work, and easily find a parking spot, they aren't ever going to give up their car."
Austin,3cpkhu,utspg1980,6,Fri Jul 10 09:13:45 2015 UTC,"My experience the last couple years here is that people don't want public transportation but LOVE Uber and Lyft and will take it all the time if they can. They have been convinced that public transportation is bad, so we are relying on services like those to fill in the gaps. As far as I know the full service buses quit running before midnight, so everyone out drinking downtown has to either pay for a Taxi/Uber or drive themselves home. And I think this is partly why we see stories just about every week on the subreddit of drunk drivers downtown. It's ridiculous and backwards. A decent bus service or light rail would be so much cheaper for a ride downtown and back home. People just aren't willing to think long term every time a rail proposal comes up for a vote."

Austin,3cpkhu,Big-glass,2,Sat Jul 11 05:02:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's trying to offset the cost of tax breaks given to corporations that are coming here.   Revenues are still increasing for the city, big time. The government simply counts missed revenue as an expense. For instance, say you make $200 if you work 20 hours, but this week your boss asks you to work 40 hours for $400. You turn him down because you have to go out of town for a wedding, but do 30 for $300. If you were the government, you'd account it like you made $400 and you spent $100 to go to the wedding.   Kind of a dumb analogy, but that's how it works with the corporations coming in. The land is doing nothing, so it's making the city nothing. The city agrees even though a building goes up on the land it'll still do the city nothing for a few more years with the assumption that extra revenue will come indirectly from jobs and the economy that forms around that company (that food trailer that popped up near the new company will pay taxes for example). Yea the city has to provide support but unless it's a place always catching on fire or requiring police it's not that expensive for the city. The corporation still needs to pay permitting fees and other city fees to cover things like code inspections, etc.   Austin just spends money poorly, and Austin voters who love voting yes on new bond measures are largely to blame. We need a medical school! We need to spend millions on ""affordable housing"" that helps only a select few. Lets hire like 20 more code compliance officers! Hell I remember Austin wanting to throw down over $600,000 to build a kitchen in some Asian cultural event center."

Yeah, there are about six major commercial streets that run north-south, and the alphabet rule doesn't apply to those. But the smaller and residential streets in between are alphabetized, with the alphabet repeating several times. Not every letter of the alphabet is represented, but if you know that a certain street starts with E and is between two of the major roads, and you come across a street that starts with G, you know you've gone too far. And ALL the east/west streets are numbers, which makes it even easier. All intersections in Lubbock are ""[number street] and [name/letter street].""

Austin,3cqddi,justscottaustin,2,Fri Jul 10 12:49:00 2015 UTC,"I posted this in a ""Stupid Question Sunday"" thread a few months ago:   Austin's founder & designer, Edwin Waller, selected Austin's site in the 1830s because it was a treeless plain with bluffs on wither side and a dominant hill (which would eventually become Capitol Hill). To optimally place a grid within the bluffs, the hill and the Colorado river , Waller shifted the grid 15 degrees off N-S axis. East Avenue (now I-35) formed the eastern boundary, running parallel to the bluff we know and love when stuck in traffic near downtown. Congress would run parallel and be on axis with the prominent hill.  When UT was established, the city grid was altered @ what is now MLK because the hill the university would be placed on was askew from Capitol Hill. Not so sure about north of 29th street, though it seems to be an attempt to shift back to the original orientation."

Austin,3cqddi,MrMooMooDandy,55,Fri Jul 10 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"I actually know the answer to this. When they built the first state capitol in 1853, they used special wood that was regionally unique to Bastrop. This isn't the state capitol we know today, this was a wooden structure. The wood was hauled in December 1851 through February 1852. It was procured from what we know today as Bastrop State Park. 1851-52 was an unseasonably cold winter and the wood couriers wound up taking a bit longer because a small allotment was going toward keeping fires warm on the 30 mile journey. I actually have no idea what the answer is but I have been drinking."

Austin,3cqddi,s810,3,Fri Jul 10 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"Because of physical geography. Take a look at the satellite view of the region, and you will see that 35 runs right along the ridge of The Balcones Escarpment, because old roads are built in the path of least resistance, not with cardinal direction in mind."
Austin,3cqddi,violenceofthelambs,3,Fri Jul 10 05:13:28 2015 UTC,I think this is most of the reason but it might be interesting to ask at the Austin History Center or the Texas Land Office. Old roads also went from town to town and needed to cross rivers at places that had ferries or were easy to cross. Towns were located where there were rivers or springs. Some roads went along natural prairies rather than pushing through woods and that was caused by soil type differences. Long before there was I35 there was the Chisholm Trail.
Austin,3cqddi,bevbh,4,Fri Jul 10 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the physical geography of the area. Edwin Waller led the survey and original 14-block grid plan of downtown. It's situated on a relatively flat plain on the northern bank of the Colorado, between Waller and Shoal Creek.   Caesar Chavez (originally Water, then 1st Street) runs parallel with the bank of the Colorado there, and Congress and other north-south streets were laid out perpendicular to Water St."

If you have a convection oven that cooks them such that the skin is crispy they are heavenly, air fried is the bomb. The fat melts under the skin while the meat cooks then drains out the bottom leaving behind tender dark meat."

There will be sections where you'll see optional offshoots/loops, those are usually a bit more technical in nature, but rewarding for flow.  I'd suggest a real mtb for mule shoe, it tends to be more tech than pace bend and much sandier, which can create grip problems if your tires aren't a bit larger volume, as they'll dig in like a rudder (really only a problem on the first half of the trail)."

Austin,3cq58z,d4rwins_chap,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"I can only imagine the lab that dedicates itself to ""liquor testing"".  This is a difficult problem.  Vodka is vodka... there are slight impurities which do change its character, but there's no specification sheet for any vodka mfg on what its defining characteristics are.  Truth is, I doubt you could tell Skyy vodka from the far cheaper Tito's.  Tito's is fine quality.  You COULD tell it from cheap-ass Skol which has some fusel oils in it.    But the thing is, distilling out high-purity neutral grain spirits on an industrial became cheap and easy like 20 years ago.  You don't need to be a ""super premium"" brand to get high purity vodka.  In fact, Tito's got sued over the ""handmade"" label because they were buying standard neutral spirits and repackaging them.    The market sells these spirits to different mfgs.  Could be made to the same market spec, could even be the same mfg.  Not sure how you define and separate them out of the bottle.  Not sure why it matters, if you accuse a bar of selling a vodka that make have ultimately come from the same industrial distillery but one goes through a mfg who puts it in a blue bottle and one that puts it in a clear bottle.   Seems petty to me.  Back in Prohibition, the problem was they were taking industrial solvent alcohol and selling it as a potable beverage.  Either by itself or as an extender for the more expensive moonshine."

Austin,3cq58z,NCOSRane,11,Fri Jul 10 02:26:38 2015 UTC,I'd wager that most people can't tell the difference between mid and top shelf liquors. I'd also wager that bars know this and they are taking advantage of it to save a few bucks. It's not like they're giving you McCormick's. They're probably giving you something mid shelf and calling it top shelf.
Austin,3cq58z,pitchingataint,7,Fri Jul 10 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"You underestimate the power of the old drunkard. When you get on in the years, and you've had your drink, made the same way for decades, and home and in bars, you know when somebody used the wrong vodka.  Now, if you're a 21 year old college kid ordering some stupidly overpriced mixed drink at a fancy place with 15 ingredients and about two drops of actual vodka in there somewhere, and you order a bunch of different stuff everywhere you go, I could leave out the alcohol entirely and pee in the glass, and that stupid kid would never notice.  Due to all the vodka I drink, the kid would still get pretty wasted from my piss."
Austin,3cq58z,NCOSRane,8,Fri Jul 10 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"How many grizzled veterans of the Liquor Tasting Wars do you think there are in this town vs. college kids/out-of-towners ordering bullshit drinks? I'd wager for every ""I can tell you the agave in this tequila was left on a plastic shelf"" there's at least a dozen ""HELL YEAH JOSE CUERVO I LOVE AUSTIN""."
Austin,3cq58z,Slypenslyde,3,Fri Jul 10 12:55:51 2015 UTC,Bartenders could easily be smart about it too. Give the guy who orders fancy stuff straight or on the rocks the real thing. Swap the cheapo swill for most mixed drinks or already-tipsy kids ordering a round of shots.
Austin,3cq58z,uluman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. That was almost exactly my point. The liquor snobs are just a few out of the many who don't really care.

Austin,3cp26d,icanhaznph,6,Thu Jul 9 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"There have been several meetings with both the Fiber engineering team as well as the marketing team. The marketing team is just that, marketing. They're the ones you probably spoke to initially and they are also the ones saying our zone won't be done until late fall 2015. The engineering team (ran by an Australian gentleman - I forget his name) are the people designing and doing the physical work. They are the ones you want to talk to, as they have a better idea as to what is going on at a construction level. Basically it works out like this:  Marketing team signs your home/property up and schedules the date for construction to begin alongside the engineering team.  Engineering team does an initial walkthrough to determine the best way to install new infrastructure (i.e. dropping lines through attics versus trenching).  Engineering team arrives either on schedule or before (provided a new time slot opens up - as is the case for us) to install.  After install, you are placed on a schedule to be connected to the street which occurs in 2 phases.  1) They connect you to their existing fiberhood. This is done by trenching or wiring new lines on or around your property directly to the USGS hub (big metal grey box usually in the center of the fiberhood) they had installed before even touching your property.   2) Splicers are scheduled to arrive sometime after to physically connect you to the fiberhood.   Once this is complete, the marketing team activates you to the fiberhood network and provides you with a new modem and/or (depending on your package) the TV fiberbox. We are currently in the splicing phase, which should occur shortly."

Austin,3cp26d,dokumentamarble,3,Fri Jul 10 12:51:17 2015 UTC,"Check your terms of agreement with your ISP, more than likely you can not host your own server.   I was referring to hosting your own server on your own hardware, not getting server space from Google (Not sure what you meant but I think that is how you interpreted it).   Go back 10 years and people would tell you that  having a 100/10 or even a 50/5 connection is overkill and you will never use it. They would also say having a single 10TB hdd is ridiculous. Times change and having the infrastructure to support more great and new things is highly desired.

Will they all be 1gig?  What area will be covered?  Cost?    I do hope they start with the outer edges of the city and work inwards as most of the metro areas have decent speeds, not 1gig mind you, but I'd venture to say in the 20Mbps range."
Austin,3cp26d,austin-dude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:40 2015 UTC,"This appears to be very good news. If the City is in deed planning to own the infrastructure that Google is putting into the ground that's perfect.  I'd be on board with the city owning the cable plant, and then services be VLANed off to 10's or 100's of service provider networks like Google, TWC, AT&T, Grande, etc. etc. They can provide services all over the same cable plant all over the city. There is no need to waste resources and have 3 or 4 different fiber plants run all over the city. It's wasteful and this type of solution opens up competition like we've never seen before. Imagine the choices and price competition this could drive."

I'm a motorcyclist. I accept the risks when I get on my bike, and those risks inform the decisions I make while riding it. I think most of us do; it's part of the motorcyclist prep course. I would love to see some stats on motorcycle-involved collisions based on per capita ridership, compared to auto-only collisions and see if there's a trend regarding the legality of lane splitting for the areas."
Austin,3cuutn,bikegrrrrl,0,Sun Jul 12 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"I HATE that.  Where there is a single left turn lane, and cars from the next lane over (a go-straight lane) make a left turn anyway as if it's a normal thing."
Austin,3cuutn,reddit3200,8,Sun Jul 12 01:30:56 2015 UTC,"It's a PERFECT example of responsible splitting (except for a couple parts, but in her commentary, she calls out that she knows she was riding improperly).   She still did do a few irresponsible things, and really shouldn't have been lane splitting where cars were merging and taking exits. So many motorcyclists speed through slow moving traffic. I've been honked at for trying to change lanes when motorcyclists are lane splitting 30-40mph faster than the flow of traffic. Even when a cop sees these guys try to pull off dangerous maneuvers, they're rarely able to catch up to them in rush hour traffic. It just doesn't make sense to legalize. And this is coming from someone who lived and commuted in the Bay Area for 4 years."
Austin,3cuutn,hiptobecubic,-3,Sat Jul 11 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  Splitting in CA where it's legal is entirely different from other states where it's not.  Around here, you have to be extra courteous and conservative with when you choose to split.  Here in TX, I see myself as a sort of splitting ambassador, where I make sure that when I split, I do it properly and with consideration in order to show drivers that it isn't risky or dangerous.  Better public opinion of splitting means a higher chance that splitting might become legal here.  But if all drivers see (or remember) are squids tearing through traffic, giving the finger to anyone who hasn't left a wide enough gap, it will remain illegal. :("
Austin,3cuutn,bikegrrrrl,12,Sat Jul 11 00:23:31 2015 UTC,"If you are doing it in places where it is not legal, then you are not doing it properly and in a way that isn't risky or dangerous.  The main problem I have with it is that there is a huge assumption that the cars on the road are all going to just keep doing whatever it is that the motorcyclist has predicted. This is a terrible driving strategy and causes lots of accidents every year. ""He had his blinker on! I thought he would turn!"", ""He stomped the brakes! How was I supposed to know he would do that!?""  etc.  For two-wheelers, it's literally life and death when this happens. Driving around without dying is hard enough as it is.

Like most things safety related you need to assume the lowest common denominator (drivers and riders). I couldn't even imagine RoT rally week with lane splitting. There would be lots of accidents. Let's also factor in that roads like Mopac feel  (and most likely are decreased to the minimum allowed) like they keep shrinking the lanes to accommodate the new toll lane."
Austin,3cuutn,tasslehawf,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"I think the percentage of responsible v. irresponsible splitters here in TX is due to the legality of the practice.  Because it is illegal, the responsible riders follow the law and don't currently split.  Therefore those that do currently split are those who disregard laws and ride irresponsibly.  Thus shaping public perception of the act as a whole.  In CA, the opposite is true.... since splitting is legal, a larger proportion of riders split, and there the majority split responsibly and it's only the outliers who ride like douchebags."
Austin,3cuutn,Filthyloins,4,Sat Jul 11 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on how skilled the rider is at predicting drivers' actions and their ability to react to unexpected actions.   No it doesn't. Their ability to react determines the likelihood that they'll have to be scraped off the road when they get it wrong, but it does not imply that they aren't going to get it wrong. They will eventually get it wrong. Stats don't lie. Well, yes they do, but in this case they are a strong indication that motorcyclists really aren't that great at not getting into accidents and the consequences are obviously much worse.  More importantly, it doesn't even matter because that's not my point. My point is not that there exists some excellent motorcyclist out there who always does it right. My point is that there are a sufficient number doing it wrong that the only reasonable thing for a car to do is to assume that everyone is a stupid, crazy asshole that doesn't realize how dangerous it is to sneak up on them while doing 50 on the highway. Otherwise, you will kill them and you would really rather not.   okay then. prejudice obvious. I'll just move along.   It's the law. It's not my decision. In California it is much safer than here because most drivers are conditioned to expect it. Here, that is not the case. Here, no one is expecting an extra vehicle to just appear between them and the truck next to them. That makes it dangerous. Surely you can understand this.   edit: just read your reply to the post in /r/motorcycles.... you're upset that splitters pass you ""at high speed"" and scare you while you're in your car. Aside from the ""pay attention to your surroundings when you're driving a car"" reply, I'll direct you to actually watch the video and note that the speeds displayed are reasonable and responsible (the entire point of posting this video).   The problem is that as a driver you have a mental model for how the roads work. Lane splitting violates that model. That makes it risky. Surely as a motorcyclist you're aware of motorcycle blindness? Where a car looks right at you and then almost plows into you and then says ""Oh balls! I didn't see him there!""  How does this happen? It happens because the person is not looking for motorcycles, they are looking for cars. It happens to me all the time when I'm on my bike because there aren't enough bikes for it to be common enough for everyone to adjust their mental models of how roads work. If it happens when motorcyclists are driving in obvious places, it stands to reason that driving in subtle places is far more dangerous. You can blame cars for not driving in perfectly straight lines and checking their mirrors constantly while in slow moving traffic if you want to. It solves nothing and in a place like here where you are literally breaking the law and 100% wrong to be doing it you can't even blame the driver. They aren't checking their mirrors because there is no reason to expect someone to just appear in the middle of the road at any moment.   But if you choose to simply read the title (""lane splitting""), then post your own prejudice without actually watching the video, I can't help you.   This is a shitty cop-out to avoid coming to terms with what I'm saying, I guess. I did watch the video. The driver is safer than most but there are several parts where she AND THE OTHER MOTORCYCLISTS COMMENTING ON IT both say she was doing things in an unsafe way. My point is that cars have to assume you are a stupid asshole because enough motorcyclists are that it ignoring the danger is not a workable solution."
Austin,3cuutn,_lord_business_,-1,Sat Jul 11 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"The same logic can be applied to driving a car.  ""When they get it wrong"" they get into an accident.  So does that mean we should ban manually-controlled cars?     in this case they are a strong indication that motorcyclists really aren't that great at not getting into accidents and the consequences are obviously much worse.   Ban motorcycles altogether?  CHP report from last year found that when lane splitting is done responsibly (like in the video I linked), it's no more dangerous than just riding a motorcycle is.  So do you want to ban motorcycles entirely?  Because motorcyclists tend to get into accidents?   My point is that cars have to assume you are a stupid asshole because enough motorcyclists are that it ignoring the danger is not a workable solution.   Look at Austin's drivers.  It's a recurring thread here in this sub that Austin drivers, as a whole, suck.  By your logic, we shouldn't ""ignore the danger"" and continue to allow humans to drive cars.  Of course, this comparison sounds ridiculous, but coming from a region where splitting is commonplace, banning it for being ""dangerous"" sounds just as ridiculous to me.   The problem is that as a driver you have a mental model for how the roads work. Lane splitting violates that model. That makes it risky.   So you change the model.  Splitting has been legal in CA for decades.  I'm sure when it was initially implemented, it took a while for the populace to learn the new behavior.  But they did.  And as you saw in the video, most drivers when they see a bike coming up in their mirrors, will move to the side of their lane in order to make room.  It's become part of their ""model"".   Where a car looks right at you and then almost plows into you and then says ""Oh balls! I didn't see him there!"" How does this happen? It happens because the person is not looking for motorcycles, they are looking for cars.    Yup, hence the ""look twice for motorcycles"" public safety campaign.  But as a rider, you know you can't rely on drivers to do the right thing and keep you safe;  you have to take your safety into your own hands.  When approaching an intersection where a car is waiting to turn left.... you MUST assume that they're going to ""not see you"" and turn in front of you.  Therefore you slow down, watch the driver, and be prepared to hit the brakes.  This is accepted knowledge that motorcycle riders possess; we don't assume that drivers will do the right thing, instead we assume that they're all batshit crazy, and we ride as if they are.... ""ride as if you're invisible"" is a common saying.  We don't expect drivers to make exceptions or allowances for riders splitting lanes, y'all rarely make exceptions even for other cars, so why should bikes be any different?"
Austin,3cuutn,xampl9,2,Sat Jul 11 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"The same logic can be applied to driving a car. ""When they get it wrong"" they get into an accident. So does that mean we should ban manually-controlled cars?   (Spoilers) A lot of people are predicting this is going to happen eventually in some form or another, because yes, people are terrible at driving. If it isn't done with legislation it will be done through restricted auto-car only roads, increased insurance costs, etc. Personally, I wouldn't mind it. I hate cars in pretty much any context other than joy riding in the countryside, and I'd be willing to give that up if it meant no cars fucking up the city center.   Ban motorcycles altogether? CHP report from last year found that when lane splitting is done responsibly (like in the video I linked), it's no more dangerous than just riding a motorcycle is. So do you want to ban motorcycles entirely? Because motorcyclists tend to get into accidents?   Well the obvious question is how often is it done irresponsibly and what kinds of effects does that have? Any traffic flow benefits are thrown out the window 100-fold if an extra accident is caused. There is a huge precedent in law of things being banned not because doing them responsibly is a problem, but because doing them irresponsibly is both really easy and really harmful. For example, many parks will not let you build a fire of any kind. It's entirely possible to do so in a safe and reasonable way and many campers know how, but because so many people just pour lighter fluid on a pile of leaves and grab their lawn chairs it's too risky to allow at all.   Yup, hence the ""look twice for motorcycles"" public safety campaign. But as a rider, you know you can't rely on drivers to do the right thing and keep you safe; you have to take your safety into your own hands. When approaching an intersection where a car is waiting to turn left.... you MUST assume that they're going to ""not see you"" and turn in front of you. Therefore you slow down, watch the driver, and be prepared to hit the brakes.   Absolutely. I'm a cyclist and it's even worse for us sometimes. We make no noise and we're in danger even when a car in the right lane is trying to turn right, which they always assume is just fine and safe, they almost never indicate because no one can really do anything about it anyway and since there's a driveway or business entrance every 50 feet, it can happen practically anytime.  I'm saying that lane-splitting flies in the face of this mentality. Rather than going out of your way to be safe and visible and treating every driver as if they are just going to ram you for no reason, suddenly you are coming up right next cars, much closer than they would expect and usually with no warning whatsoever. It's startling for drivers and if they don't constantly check their mirrors, which is not common when not expecting to change lanes, let alone when in slow moving traffic, they will never see you coming.   So you change the model.   You change the model by first changing the law, then by educating the drivers. Not by a vigilante decision to show everyone that it's, ""not a big deal"" and they should just pay more attention.   ...we assume that they're all batshit crazy, and we ride as if they are.... ""ride as if you're invisible"" is a common saying.   Right. Again, lane-splitting is really in direct conflict with this principle unless you think about it like, ""Ride as if no one will notice you slipping through all these gaps in traffic,"" which I think is not what they were going for. :)  Really though, I don't see how you see no conflict between this central idea being as conspicuous as possible while not trusting anyone to drive predictably and lane-splitting."

Austin,3cqvl4,bonecruhsha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:35:55 2015 UTC,Dogs Out Loud is definitely going to be your best bet. They work specifically to fix these kinds of issues.
Austin,3cqvl4,monarchatx,10,Fri Jul 10 14:47:37 2015 UTC,"Vet tech here.. I have had sooo many clients be where you are.  For that I am sorry.  I have heard good things about dog boys dog ranch behavioral training.  Might try them as a last hope.  But to be honest, he might have to be euthanized if behavior training does not work for him.  Its not fair and it 100% sucks."
Austin,3cqvl4,monarchatx,5,Fri Jul 10 12:33:17 2015 UTC,"I can't stress how sorry I am that you're in this position with your dog. Since you're here for every resource, I do just want to mention that I am a member of the Austin Pets Alive behavior team that was drawn towards this post by the community to reach out and offer help.   I believe I know your specific dog very well, in fact he was one of my favorites whenever he was here. He used to be in a training program called the Canine Good Citizen but, due to some concerning behaviors, we actually removed him. Those behaviors were specifically some low growling at people who approached him while in our adoptions office, and some growling at people in the home while on an extended sleepover with one of our volunteers. I can honestly tell you, we did not know the extent of his issues when he was adopted by you. If we had, unfortunately, we would not have placed him into anyones home due to his inability to be a safe dog in the community.  I will not make excuses for myself and my organization, and I was not drawn here to point fingers or lay blame. However, this is a community post, so for the sake of both sides I do need to clarify a few things about this particular dog. The minor points we disclosed to you were the only instances we had of your fella, who for privacy I will call R, having any tendencies of aggression towards people. Those tendencies, as noted above, were of low growling in two separate instances at people coming into his space. He was generally well known as a sweet and happy boy who could be handled by nearly anyone. In a two year history filled with sleepovers, walks and playgroups, we made sure you had every note and detail we had. Unfortunately, and I think we can both agree, R's behavior has become a little more than minor. Through our communications and training sessions, it appears that we've come to the same page: that R is unpredictably aggressive towards people. We got to this conclusion, and again I am only here to be the second side to the story, because of the several instances where he displayed that he was seemingly fine with someone and then was not. These head butts were also leaving punctures on people that he either knew or seemed completely fine with. The separation anxiety, however, is definitely new behavior that we can absolutely help with. Please contact us.  Austin Pets Alive will always take their dogs back. However, our options for R are limited. His lifestyle is either managed by his current home or he would have to be humanely euthanized. While we will take him back, he will not be a dog that we will place up for adoption and he will be euthanized. As saddened as this makes all of us, I think we can all agree that we can not adopt him back out to the public now that we do know so much about his behavior and about his lack of response to treatment. As someone who personally knew this dog for the two years in our care, this is a very difficult decision. Not only due to the loss of life, but as we, together, have placed a lot of work and love into him. We are all heartbroken."
Austin,3cqvl4,locura79,3,Fri Jul 10 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"hi there, yep you hit the nail on the head its R. firstly, I want to stress how much we love this dog & even through everything are glad to have had him in our lives. which is why I reached out to this community. we've hit a wall with training, Taurus can't really do much more for us, & the vet even seemed to say ""well, this is going to be his life"".   as I said in another response, which might be buried in another comment: the possessiveness was manageable, the not being a ""dogs dog"" was manageable... the separation anxiety worries us tremendously. he dented his metal crate, not just a little dent, the door is bent so badly it won't shut right. he pees as soon as he thinks he's alone. he loves his crate, will go in the first time we ask every time, he's gotten so obedient to us. he met my 6'5"" imposing father & 6'7"" brother and snuggled with them! he was obsessed with both of them and not in the usual ""wary"" way he looks at men. we were so excited & thought we had made a lot of progress (and I do think we have!).   ... but at this point it's a health issue. he's lost 6-8 pounds in what seems to be overnight. he shakes so bad when we get home that we can hear the crate rattling through a closed door (he stays in a room at the end of the hallway). we've spent more time & money at the vet lately than we have anywhere else. we're genuinely concerned & feel like we ran out of options. we'll be in contact. we had a long emotional discussion today, & are still chewing over our options. obviously whatever we decide is a forever thing and are not about to make a rash decision.   I'm honestly surprised that this post has gotten so much attention, and I thank you for reaching out."
Austin,3cqvl4,baileytherapyhound,2,Sat Jul 11 05:13:32 2015 UTC,"also I'm rereading my original post for the first time & you're right. the paragraph about his growling/nipping was terribly written & I am sorry. I wrote it all in one shot while my brain was definitely very jumbled - it is hard to think clearly about all this. I completely failed to specify the incident we were told of versus what happened in the house. you are correct with the distinctions, that's my bad & was completely not on purpose. roommate & I have talked a lot about the day we adopted him - looking back through everything that's happened it's hard not to accuse APA of downplaying the growling at the foster home. it's definitely comforting to know that nobody was aware of how bad the situation is. because of the warning we were wary/cautious when introducing people to him, taking our time & trying not to overwhelm or excite him. and things did go very smoothly for a while (probably about a month) until my friend visiting from out of town went to put his bag on my bed, R jumped up & headbutted him. breaking his glasses, which is what we thought cut his face, until something similar happened with another friend who didn't wear glasses. we consulted APA after both incidents & were grateful for the help. figuring out his triggers was never really successful, beyond ""male""."
Austin,3cqvl4,ohsweetie,8,Sat Jul 11 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, pit bulls are the #1 dog at shelters because people don't typically want to adopt an adult dog that may have problems like you've mentioned.  They are high energy dogs that need a lot of work, very intelligent and willful (all terriers are) and their reputation makes them undesirable adoption candidates when they are full grown.  I think you can count on all pit bull rescue groups being full of dogs that they have saved, placed with fosters, and are slow to adopt.  APA might take the dog back, but I have a friend who has been an active foster with them and had them turn her down on returning a foster dog she could no longer handle.  That dog was humanely euthanized after months of specialized training.  I would suggest that you contact APA and let them know what is going on.  See if they will take the dog back or if they can offer some free intensive training that might help get you over the hump of adjustment.  It may take several more months of training to get the dog to deal with separation anxiety and crating, which seems like the worst issue.  Ultimately though, it sounds like the two of you didn't understand fully the needs of a pit bull and lack the experience on how to take a dominant position to handle the dog.  As I mentioned, these dogs need a LOT of exercise and enrichment activity to keep them happy.  You might consider tying the dog to your bike and taking him on a long run before you crate him and before you have a training session, working out excess energy can make them significantly more tractable.  Enrichment toys, like dog puzzles, can also be helpful, so that he's not bored or taking out his boredom in destructive ways.  In any case, I would strongly advice NOT rehoming the dog with an individual no matter how at risk he is for euthanasia through a rescue or shelter.  If the next person has to give him up, the instability will simply cement the existing problems and create new ones until the dog is dangerous or completely unfit to be a companion animal.  The other risk is that he would end up as a fighting dog or tethered to a chain, because he's unmanageable.  It's hard to know that he may end up euthanized, but sometimes that's all you can do with a damaged dog that has all the possibility in the world of hurting someone due to his strength and size.  You made the wrong choice in adopting this dog, but it would be a worse choice to just hand him off.  You'll need to either continue to try and work with him with APA resources and a change in your methods or let the shelter do what's best, which may indeed be euthanizing him."
Austin,3cqvl4,Lucky_Kleinschmidt,6,Fri Jul 10 02:22:11 2015 UTC,"we've been in contact with APA from day one, they won't take him back because of his ""incidents"". trying to avoid him being put down. i agree that rehoming would only make the situation worse. i wouldn't say we made the wrong choice, we've both worked really hard to change everything that's happening. APA & Taurus & our vet have been helping us every step of the way, we've been following their info exactly, and yet things are still getting worse. at that point i'm sorry but it's simply out of our hands."
Austin,3cqvl4,ohsweetie,4,Fri Jul 10 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"By ""wrong choice"", I mean the choice of dog, not to adopt one in general.  Pit bulls and any bully breed are difficult dogs to handle in a lot of cases.  I'm sure if the dog were smaller and had these problems, it wouldn't be as much of an issue.  I'm very sorry if my comment was offensive, it certainly wasn't meant to be.  I'm an active foster and rescuer, and find it kind of deplorable that APA would adopt out a dog like this without being incredibly clear on the issues and amount of effort it would take.  It's also not a surprise that they are backing away from the situation, as that's what they did with my friend who rehabs pits.  That dog went through a year of intensive work with someone who had almost endless time to spend and still ended up almost killing another dog.  I know this is very upsetting for you, but I agree that this is beyond your ability to help.  You can spend years working with a troubled dog and it may never be what it could have been with a proper beginning.  You also have no idea how many homes this dog has been through, the experiences it has had, or how deeply the issues are embedded into its personality.  It's a tough call and I hope you can find a solution, but if you can't, just make the best possible choice for the dog."
Austin,3cqvl4,waitressinthesky,4,Fri Jul 10 04:56:30 2015 UTC,"thank you for your clarification, I do understand what you meant now. there's been quite a bit of negativity in this post so I was definitely projecting.   I really thank you for a good honest & honestly emotionally helpful answer. I have a friend who has three pitties & I've had the good fortune to spend a lot of time babysitting them. I honestly think we have a good handle on the ""energy"" aspect of things. roommate & myself are very outdoorsy & fortunately have lots of time for hikes, which he tends to come on. it's come down to the ""emotional"" aspect.   honestly him not being a ""dog's dog"" is no big deal, crating him when I have a guy over is no big deal, these are things we discovered early into owning him. it's the separation anxiety which we've been dealing with for going on three months now, which popped up out of seemingly nowhere. vet's program has done nothing, training has done nothing. he loves his crate, even takes naps in there when we're home & he's free to roam. totally fine when he's locked in the crate and were home. but the second he can't hear us (even if I'm sleeping in my room & he's crated in the living room) he goes nuts. has dented the metal crate. I'm afraid to leave the house to take out the garbage because I think he might hurt himself when he freaks out."
Austin,3cqvl4,muhyati_sati,-1,Fri Jul 10 05:12:29 2015 UTC,APA will take back any animal adopted from them. Who told you that they won't take him back?

Austin,3cqvl4,snackmantis,4,Fri Jul 10 06:16:23 2015 UTC,"You might want to contact the Canine Center: http://morefunthandirt.com/  They are considered the top of the field in Austin for dogs with behavioral issues. They will do a behavior evaluation for you and give you an honest assessment of what, if anything, can be done to help you and your dog. My dog and I go there every now and then for a class and I always see them making great strides with dogs that are facing similar problems."
Austin,3cqvl4,omnomberry,5,Fri Jul 10 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"Hey I just wanted to let you know I've been in the exact same spot before. I adopted a 5 year old shepherd mix from APA and they told me she was fine around other dogs and was very calm and suitable for apartment life.  None of those things ended up being true. She was extremely aggressive toward other dogs, she had severe anxiety (literally broke out of two crates and jumped through closed glass windows), and had some other issues that -- had APA informed me of -- I might not have chosen that particular dog.  It's good that you're trying to do what's best for him by finding a new owner and new home that can give him the time and attention he needs. What I ended up doing with my dog was placing her in the APA foster program. Best of luck to you, hope something works out"
Austin,3cqvl4,bwafflecone,6,Fri Jul 10 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"that makes me so sad to know they've done this before. they seriously told us about it, basically said ""but it's no biggie"" so we wrote it off. they told us about how he's made so many leaps & bounds and was in some special program for learning doggie social skills and was a star. THEN they said, if you want him you have to take him today. so they let us fall in love with him, told us ""nbd on the behavioral issues"", and said ""take him now he might be gone in the morning"". wtf. every shelter I've been to elsewhere has a 24 hr waiting period while they file your paperwork at LEAST.   all of that aside, we never would have adopted him if we had known we couldn't handle it. we went in that day looking for a pup, had a great connection with him & only him. we were ready to leave after playing with 5 dogs, none of whom seemed ""right"" for us. it breaks my heart & we've been going back & forth on this for 3 months now."
Austin,3cqvl4,monarchatx,3,Fri Jul 10 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"This is what APA does, it is their business model.  They take the aggressive dogs that no one wants to adopt and then they pawn them off on some sucker who thinks he/she is doing a good thing by adopting a dog from them.  This is what it means to be a ""No Kill"" city.  Yay."
Austin,3cqvl4,bwafflecone,5,Fri Jul 10 18:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah they did the same thing with me, downplayed her issues and told me I had to take her home the exact same day even after I told them I wanted to wait until the weekend (it was a Wednesday). I will not be adopting through them again, which is unfortunate, but I'd prefer the humane society or another shelter that I can trust more.  It's a really hard decision, I know you love your pup, but it seems like you're trying to do the right thing. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty when they don't fully understand the situation"
Austin,3cqvl4,alittlejelly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm glad I chose to foster my dog before I adopted her. I am a big proponent of doggie adoption, but having this dog live with me for a few months before we knew we were compatible was a great choice."
Austin,3cqvl4,alittlejelly,5,Fri Jul 10 13:24:52 2015 UTC,Contact APA's behavior team via www.austinpetsalive.org/get-pet-help/ and ask for help. APA will take back an animal adopted through its organization no matter how long ago the adoption took place or even where the animal may live so that the animal does not end up in an at-risk shelter situation.
Austin,3cqvl4,snackmantis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:58:52 2015 UTC,"failed to mention before, we've been in contact with APA, they said they won't take him back because of his incidents."
Austin,3cqvl4,alittlejelly,4,Fri Jul 10 03:15:58 2015 UTC,"Ken Martin is a veterinary behaviorist who is well-regarded in the Austin area.  He is not cheap but a consultation may help you decide what to do.  Very few responsible rescues are going to take him.  He would be very difficult to responsibly place and they would be opening themselves up to liability if there were another incident.  With the resources it would take to help this one dog, they could probably save 20 other dogs.  The only place I can think of that would work is a sanctuary situation like Best Friends where they have the resources to work with him indefinitely if needed.  They don't normally take owner surrenders but they do have an established relationship with APA so they might make an exception.  Contact them at nmhpnetwork@bestfriends.org.  In your email, you need to focus less on you and more on the dog and his behaviors and what you have done to correct them.  Minimize the ""we don't have time to give him what he needs"" aspect and focus on the fact that you do not have the ability to handle him.  Include the fact that you have tried to simply return him to APA (as specified in their adoption contract) but they refuse to take him.  Also include a brief physical summary such as ""80 lb. pit bull, neutered male, microchipped, current on vaccinations, approximate age 4 years, no known health issues"".    For what it is worth, crating can sometimes make separation anxiety worse so he might do better out of the crate if that is at all feasible.  If you haven't already tried it, try dog appeasing pheromone (DAP).  It is a pheromone secreted by nursing mothers to comfort the pups.  It comes in a spray, a collar, or a room diffuser.  The brand names I have used are Adaptil and ComfortZone.  Petco and Tomlinson's carry it."
Austin,3cqvl4,snackmantis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:01:55 2015 UTC,Best Friends can only take dog social dogs at this point and they are really hard to get in.

Austin,3cqvl4,snackmantis,5,Fri Jul 10 14:28:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you've heard of them, but Love-A-Bull is a local pit bull advocate group that may be able to help. They don't take owner surrenders, but it sounds like they have a lot of resources to help owners who are having issues (see this link).  Also keep in mind that the theory that dogs are trying to be the alpha has been debunked. Instead, a trainer or veterinary behaviorist would help you guys understand what's setting your dog off and help you make progress with him.  Finally, according to the APA FAQs here, they'll take back any pet that they've previously adopted out, so that's still an option. I'm not familiar on how they handle dogs with issues though (i.e. rehabilitation vs euthanasia)"

Austin,3cqvl4,yellowraincoat,6,Fri Jul 10 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"I also wanted to mention that in our quest for a ""no-kill"" city, resources are often wasted on dogs that will never be suitable pets.  It's a terrible thing and I really feel like they knew the dog was difficult, but failed to give you all the information you needed to make a reasonable decision.  They are irresponsible for not taking responsibility for adopting out a dog like this to unsuspecting people.  It's dangerous and one of the many failures in a ""no-kill"" policy.  I'm sorry for all of you."
Austin,3cqvl4,BlueRose85,2,Fri Jul 10 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"I told myself over & over that I was crazy & that they must not have known. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but reading how many other people have had this problem makes me really sad, because it's just confirming the worst."
Austin,3cqvl4,shut_up_josh,0,Fri Jul 10 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, weird that APA would change their policy like that. Maybe it's because of the shelter overcrowding problem?  Either way, best of luck with your dog! It's definitely a tough situation and it can be hard to determine the best thing to do. Also, if you want to check out some other subreddits for advice, I'd recommend /r/dogs and /r/dogtraining."
Austin,3cqvl4,shut_up_josh,2,Fri Jul 10 05:11:58 2015 UTC,"It's a real shocker to me here that APA will not take him back. Have you tried going as far as you can go with them? Meaning talking to someone higher up than just the adoption coordinator. I used to volunteer for a shelter and they had a policy that for no matter what reason, they would always take a dog back. Do you still have your adoption contract that you signed with them? I'd go over it with a fine tooth comb to see if they are legally obligated to take him back.   It makes me mad that they won't. I agree with the poster who said they should've never adopted out this animal to anyone.   I hope you follow up on some of the leads you got here. Please keep us updated :)"

It's actually in your adoption contract that if you have to surrender the dog for any reason he must go to APA and not another shelter. Because they spend the money and time saving these animals, the last thing they want is for one to end up in say Wilco shelter and be euthanized. Email records@austinpetsalive.org they can help you if you need to give back the dog or point you towards better behavior help if that's an option in any way.

Austin,3cqvl4,Mr_Science_esq,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:36 2015 UTC,"While Love-A-Bull doesn't take owner surrenders like this, they are a great source of information/education/help for all of these issues.  Dogs have come through LAB with all of these problems.  They do a monthly dog walk at Mueller that is great for dog reactive dogs, because everyone there is very aware of that issue and keep their dogs away from other dogs.  There is also usually a trainer that brings a dog to a walk there (and if you reach out to them ahead of time I'm sure they would get someone there).  Again, they won't be able to help you re-home the dog, but if there is still any hope of rehabilitating him, they can definitely help."
Austin,3cqvl4,Mr_Science_esq,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"I recommend buckling down and fighting through this. Attempting to rehome the dog is not going to be in his best interest. The likelihood of finding anyone willing to put half the effort you have put into him is slim to none. You need to accept that the best chance that he has of hang a happy life is with you. Sending him on to another owner will almost certainly be a step back for him. Please, if you want what is best for him, keep him. Giving him up, outside of serious and complete inability to keep him, is you sacrificing his happiness for yours.   And you know what? Sometimes that's the decision people make. I would judge you a little for it, but there are worse things.   Just understand that giving him away is not in his best interest. If you are OK with that, then good luck. You'll need to work hard to find a home that will accept him as he is.   Now I don't know what kind of training you spent $2,000 on but there are fine options. Some have been listed by others. I will say I've worked with Dog Boys in Pflugerville before and had good experience. A key thing with their training is that they train the owner as much as the dog. This is important.   As for the nipping. If this is happening in play time, you need to know how to show him ""no"" in context of play. When pups play fight, they have ways of saying ""no, that wasn't ok"" to each other. I've had two dogs with painful nipping problems. I found a neat trick that corrected the issue in less than two days.   As soon as he puts too much pressure on his nip, make a loud, quick yip sound, pull yourself away quickly and turn your back on him. This tells him naturally that he went too hard. He'll push the boundary again a few times, but after repeated sudden reactions from you, he'll get the idea pretty quickly.   Of course, I don't know if his lack of socialization will mean he doesn't understand the play ""no.but it is worth a shot.   Separation anxiety is unfortunately more difficult to deal with. Be thankful it is just noise and peeing. Most cases of separation anxiety result in severe destruction of property. Some significant training may help here if this is a relatively new development. Dog Boys may be of service here. But you need behavior modification, not drugs.   Good luck finding a combination of solutions that works for you and him. Unfortunately things like this are always a possibility with adopting a pet. I thought I was way in over my head with my first dog. I'm a grown ass man that cried in the middle of the night not knowing what to do, thinking I couldn't care for him. I thought I would have to give him up, which made me feel terrible because it wasn't his fault that I wasn't a good enough owner for him.   But I was the owner he wanted, regardless of all of my faults. And he's the dog I wanted, even though he still causes me more problems than I can readily deal with. We both fought through it. We break each other's hearts sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if he would have been better off with someone with more time or money or patience. But odds are he wouldn't have found someone like that. I'm the best shot he has, and I'm kinda happy for that.   Again, good luck. I hope you keep him."
Austin,3cqvl4,artbellfan1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:02:35 2015 UTC,Please consider other sources for training if you have only worked with Taurus. They are the Wal-Mart of dog care from what I've heard. They deal in quantity not quality. There are so many local trainers that you could try for more help.
Austin,3crgpz,EmoMcGhee,7,Fri Jul 10 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"The Greenbelt entrance at Loop 360 Access seems, in my opinion, to have the least amount of walking distance from parking (and handicap spots, I do believe) to the swimmable area. However, it's still a bit of a slope from the parking lot to the water. It kind of winds and there is railing and a few steps. Not horrible, but not easy for someone with her condition either. Once you get there, the water is nice right now. You can bring a tube and float around in it. I would try that.   I'd also try Bull Creek at the park entrance, where you have a swimming hole straight off from a grassy dog park-ish area. It's nice and not too cold right now. The other areas of Bull Creek with the pretty falls have some slopey uneven stuff but still not too bad."
Austin,3crgpz,mindfields88,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:48 2015 UTC,Zilker to Gus Fruh is best bet... the Spyglass entrance has a steep incline to get down.      The entrance at mopac and 360 has a long somewhat steep hill you have to walk down with a lot of rocks  and the hill of life entrance is a big NOPE  Park at Zilker and walk down trail to Gus Fruh hole.   Its about 1/4 to 1/2 mile walk but fairly flat and easy at that point in the trail.
Austin,3crgpz,Terriblyboard,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"The 360 Access I use doesn't have a steep bit--I used to do it with a stroller.  It's at the bottom of the hill at 360 just east of Mopac, turn north at the light into what looks like an office complex.  On the west side of the parking lot there's a creek access.  The trail is winding, but not rocky or steep."
Austin,3crgpz,jenilynTX,2,Fri Jul 10 13:22:27 2015 UTC,"Every single official greenbelt access point is going to be difficult for her to get through due to the rocky slope. Ignore these comments and go to the Lost Creek part of the greenbelt. It's absolutely flat and it's less than a quarter mile to good swimming, or about a mile of flat walking to the first set of falls but that area tends to become a party area by noon so hit it up early if that's not your scene. There's one stream crossing that should still be relatively easy for her if you can lend a hand."

Austin,3crgpz,fairlydecent,2,Sat Jul 11 13:00:19 2015 UTC,"If the Greenbelt doesn't work out for you, I'd suggest checking out the Comal river in New Braunfels. It's spring fed and man-made and it's a great spot to go toobing (it's one of the best in Texas if you ask me). They have a lot of areas where it would be incredibly easy for your wife to get into the water and most of the toobing rental places are located a few feet from the water."

Since you are starting roughly at creek level I would not expect any steep hills. However, I have not hiked that part of the trail in a long time.  Also, if you're going on Saturday or Sunday you will probably have to go up the hill from the trailhead to find parking.  http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Parks/GIS/Barton_Creek_GBelt_Web_Map_reduced.pdf"

Austin,3crgpz,jenilynTX,0,Fri Jul 10 13:19:18 2015 UTC,"I think Gus Fruh is the best bet.  It is accessed off Barton Hills Dr. The trail splits rather soon, there is a steep, rocky, natural trail down, or alternatively a manmade decomposed granite switchback trail, maybe 1/8 of a mile or a little more. It is not technical.  At the bottom is the Gus Fruh swimming hole which at current flows offers better water than the 360 access, which also has a similar granite switchback.  Enjoy!"
Austin,3crgpz,moundman84,0,Fri Jul 10 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"Unless it's changed since the last time I went to Gus Fruh (about a year ago), that's going to be difficult for anyone with accessibility concerns. The switchback trail can get slippery if there's any moisture at all and there's still a bit of a rocky slope at the bottom before you get to the pool area."
Austin,3crgpz,fairlydecent,0,Fri Jul 10 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"There are 2 trails to get down to the water.  one thats very steep and rocky, and one that's a long winding flatter route, which i prefer anyways bc it's serene.  Once you enter the park, just stick to your right on the trail, and that'll be your best bet."
Austin,3cp2gt,kyfriedtexan,37,Thu Jul 9 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"Calm down. The Austin music scene has been in mortal crisis so many times since I moved here in 1979 that I've lost count.  Old clubs close, new ones open.  We'll muddle on.  One thing is for sure, though.  The epicenter of live music in Austin is going to move away from downtown and away from the central city.  'bout time, in my opinion.  EDIT: This seems apropos."

Austin,3cp2gt,LuigiVanPeebles,14,Thu Jul 9 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"We already see signs of Eastward movement. I wouldn't be shocked to see Manor or East CC pick up steam. That region already is already dominant in the studio art scene, which has significant overlap with the music community."
Austin,3cp2gt,shinoda28112,9,Thu Jul 9 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"East Cesar Chavez and Manor are right in the middle of long-long-established neighborhoods though, a big live-music scene isn't going to go over well there because of the proximity of all the residences. Studio art doesn't (usually) make any noise."
Austin,3cp2gt,kalpol,3,Thu Jul 9 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"East Cesar Chavez has quite a bit of large lots & low industrial sites not adjacent to single-family homes. It is already making the transition with new, smaller venues opening up in the last 18 months.   You may be correct about Manor though."
Austin,3cp2gt,shinoda28112,3,Thu Jul 9 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"Stay Gold and Drinks were bars before the current businesses moved into the buildings and are grandfathered into the use.

There's public transit via the metro rail/rapid, and actually, I meet a lot of austiny ""weird"" people (think thundercloud) living out here as they have been pushed from central austin  I could see that area lighting up at some point in the next few years. Of course, it would be far from an epicenter, but there's definitely potential for it to be more than what it is now"
Austin,3cp2gt,abottleofvodka,2,Fri Jul 10 06:06:34 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. There is so much industrial space with rock bottom rent along Metric and Burnet and hardly any of it is in or near a residential area. All the middle class Austinites I know who are still interested and able to go to shows are moving north of 2222. People building families are going south. The audience and infrastructure for venues is up here but the venues aren't here yet.
Austin,3cp2gt,fairlydecent,4,Fri Jul 10 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate, I say it moves north to the west anderson/burnet area."
Austin,3cp2gt,MoaninIwatodai,9,Thu Jul 9 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"would be cool, but I think its very very very unlikely  The neighborhood groups up there would rage.  They had month long protests against little woodrows on burnet which doesn't even have live music because of noise from their tvs ( and alcohol ).   Theres nowhere you can build on anderson/burnet that isn't pretty close to houses."
Austin,3cp2gt,c0c0c0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no way. The neighborhoods around there are the NIMBYist of the NIMBY. I think Little Woodrows had to secure something ridiculous like 60 parking spaces to open a small bar (technically, a restaurant which is much easier zoning to get) with no music that closes at midnight. That deal was one of those that passed after over a year of fighting with one council vote putting it over the edge."

Are you saying we have no Austin Music Hall on the east side so my point is invalid? Pshah."
Austin,3cp2gt,mannnix,4,Thu Jul 9 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"That tends to put a limit on venues for touring bands with ANY sort of draw when trying to stop in Austin. If they have no place to play because they can't find a venue due to schedule conflicts with their tour or a venue's schedule, they'll have to stop somewhere else in Texas and pass Austin over completely.  Thus, why it's ESSENTIAL that venues in the Red River District continue to exist. They can hold the amount of event attendees that is enough for the artists that would have no reason to play venues like Stubbs, Emos, The Belmont, Moody Theater, ect."
Austin,3cp2gt,dnthsslethehoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. That makes sense, but I would also like to point out that as cities evolve, so do touring acts. In the past it was no big deal to have a giant downtown warehouse sit empty during the week and then host two shows on the weekend. Today, that's just not cost effective with the residential migration to downtowns all over this country. No, these touring acts that need that kind of space need to think outdoor venue, like Fiesta Gardens."
Austin,3cp2gt,mannnix,2,Thu Jul 9 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Most of the venues in the Red River District aren't ""vacant"" during the week, contrary to what you may believe.

Austin,3cp2gt,smcdow,3,Thu Jul 9 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe. South has developed into a pretty middle/upper-middle class suburbia. There's definitely a market for entertainment down there, as demonstrated through new bars, but I wonder how friendly those neighborhoods would be to the noise of live music. That's my concern. If that epicenter is going to move, it's going to have to move a long way out to get ahead of residential development. And that's just too far to be viable."

Austin,3cp2gt,kayelar,2,Thu Jul 9 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Why ""about time""? Downtown used to be the most easily accessible for everyone to get in and see shows. There are no new places to open up venues outside of downtown, unless you want to move the entire music scene out into the sticks.  In previous years, it was easy to get around Austin and go to a venue that was not in downtown. That's not longer the case. This is a different situation than before."
Austin,3cp2gt,rednoise,9,Thu Jul 9 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"Downtown Austin is hard to get to for a huge portion of the population, the traffic sucks, the parking sucks and is expensive, it's crowded. Not everyone is 23 and lives in a studio apartment on 5th street, ready to walk to a cool venue to take in some music.  They'll stick concert halls way out toward Cedar Park, way east, way south, and/or way southwest. And you'll drive forever to get there because the freeways in Austin suck and nobody wants to expand them because greenbelts are more important than commute times to most people. But there'll be a huge parking garage, and the one or multiple facilities should be pretty nice. Be prepared for exorbitant ticket prices and sitting next to clean-cut yuppies from the burbs around the music venues, when you're used to primarily seeing the more funky native Austin crowd."
Austin,3cp2gt,NCOSRane,3,Thu Jul 9 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"I doubt those venues will even open up in the suburbs, due to noise restrictions and probably resistance by the suburbanites."

I'd say it's less the ""downfall of Austin"" and more the natural progression of things. Venues rise up and die, we have entire museums dedicated to them, it happens. I'm honestly amazed the city still neglects to recognize the cultural value of these things, but with so many newcomers who don't bother to learn history past what happened last year, who cares?"

There was an empty lot between Lunch and the building that now houses Lamberts.  And, the back alley, for a while, had a fenced in area where day laborers would gather to get jobs in the morning.  The rest of your comments I agree with.  I don't understand why the City doesn't commemorate these things either.

I'm pretty big on historical accuracy so that's good to know.  EDIT: Photos I've seen of Liberty Lunch look just like the Lambert's building. Am I crazy? So the original building with the roof made of old steel from the Armadillo no longer exists at all?"
Austin,3cp2gt,kayelar,2,Thu Jul 9 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"Nope.  It was torn down.  There was kind of a free for all on the painted bricks that made up the murals inside.  For the longest time just after it closed there was a rumor that the owners had purchased the long empty (now VIP section at Stubb's) building at 9th / Red River to resurrect the Lunch.  But, if that was ever more than just a rumor and wishful thinking, I don't know.  I remember the building that houses Lambert's being there back then, but I don't remember if there was anything in it.  There wasn't much down there.  Used to park in a gravel lot where Moody / W is now and HOPE your car was still there at the end of the show."

Austin,3cp2gt,dnthsslethehoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:00:50 2015 UTC,Most cities aren't growing as dynamically as Austin has been since 1980.
Austin,3cp2gt,kayelar,3,Thu Jul 9 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"See what kind of response you get when you tell that to all of the commuters stuck in traffic on a daily basis.

Austin,3cp2gt,dnthsslethehoff,0,Thu Jul 9 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"You're going off on a tangent that had nothing to do with what I said originally. As a commuter stuck in daily traffic, I'm not defending it. I'm just saying that Austin's dynamic growth is responsible for venues opening and closing so quickly, along with massive competition."
Austin,3cp2gt,kayelar,4,Thu Jul 9 21:59:00 2015 UTC,"You're right, I went off on a tangent. But using the growing city as an excuse as to why it cannot keep a single music venue in the downtown area for more than an average of 5-7 years before the property gets turned over, all while still using the moniker ""Live Music Capital of the World"" is a bit unsettling.   Thus the source of my tangent."
Austin,3cp2gt,dnthsslethehoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"Lol, speaking of museums...you've seen the Austin Music museum right? We sure do ""dedicate"" a lot to live music here."
Austin,3cp2gt,TheGlassface,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"Go here. It's worth noting that the exhibit space is small, but the private collection is enormous. If anything, this place is taking care of music history until there's a better place to exhibit it. The upcoming exhibit opens on July 18. It's a display of Margaret Moser's (music writer and Austin music scene old-timer) private poster collection and it should be pretty incredible. The openings are $5 and include beer, food, and live music.   Also, local museums like the Blanton and Bullock are constantly having exhibits related to the music scene. It's worth keeping an eye out."

I'd be happier if they replaced it with another music venue with better acoustics and seating, but as far as the current one goes, it wasn't doing the bands any big favors."
Austin,3cp2gt,DailyPWN,3,Thu Jul 9 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Here's a good quote:   ""If the Red River clubs get pushed out... there aren’t many viable options for a music community with the same size and infrastructure to pop up in another part of Austin."""
Austin,3cp2gt,Unsocialsocialist,5,Thu Jul 9 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the thing.  While I suppose Emo's has done ok on Riverside, it's going to be a long time before that area is set up to be a hub for venues..and with Antone's packing up, I'm not sure you're going to see a whole lot of places willing to take the risk in the short term.  West Austin isn't going to happen..perhaps some areas of North/South Austin could work, but they would be competing for land against the same type of developers that are driving the costs up downtown."

Austin,3cp2gt,alittlejelly,2,Thu Jul 9 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"That has absolutely nothing to do with what I am talking about.  Emo's seems to be doing fine..my point is that you aren't likely to see a rush of clubs to that area, and Antone's not succeeding in that part of town is part of the reason."
Austin,3cp2gt,ten6ths,0,Thu Jul 9 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"That's only because you have no idea what the hell you are talking about.  Emo's pre-C3 was helping run Antones, since they sold out to C3 that stopped.  Antones was in turn sold to a group of investors that planned to move it back downtown, they've just been taking forever"
Austin,3cp2gt,alittlejelly,3,Thu Jul 9 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"When Emo's took over the operational stuff at Antone's, it was rumored that it was due to Antone's business doing poorly. The fact that C3 didn't buy Antone's, even though they were the group that was responsible for the national acts that played there, is telling as well, especially considering the impact that the Antone's brand name carries.   Perhaps you have some inside financial info to share, but all signs point to it not being a greatest location for a venue, which was my initial point."
Austin,3cp2gt,ten6ths,0,Thu Jul 9 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"Complain as people might about the new Emo's, I saw Chvrches there last October. Living in North Austin, it was a lot easier to get to than downtown venues. Plus parking was easy. Not all new things are bad in every way."
Austin,3cp2gt,alittlejelly,3,Thu Jul 9 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"Too bad the venue itself is soulless, oversold, and echo-y. Build a damn second level balcony like the 9:30 Club in DC and it would address a few issues."
Austin,3cp2gt,waitressinthesky,0,Thu Jul 9 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"The sound was just fine at the concert I went to there. Didn't mind the soullessness because it meant I got in and out easy and didn't have to deal with the pain of trying to find parking downtown on Saturday night. We live in a city ruled by the car, unfortunately that's a huge deal breaker a lot of the time, especially if you're a female out and about on her own. Safety first."
Austin,3cp2gt,waitressinthesky,3,Thu Jul 9 21:00:14 2015 UTC,"That's interesting... parking is a pretty big complaint about Emo's, especially considering the neighborhoods you have to walk through sometimes to get to the venue.   The whole place just feels (and sounds) like a big box to me. Conversations travel better than the music, they sell so many tickets that Austin's already reluctant-to-dance audiences mostly only have room to sway back and forth...  It's just such a disappointment from the intimate and intense shows at the old Emo's. Don't get me wrong, I prefer air-conditioning to the July/August outdoor shows (though stumbling onto 6th St after a Ghostland Observatory show in late July, completely drenched in my own and everyone else's sweat, will be a concert I remember forever), but I just wish we could've kept the old Emo's instead of this new one."
Austin,3cp2gt,alittlejelly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:18:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not advocating for either or, just saying I don't mind Emo's. I parked in the lot across for the complex by the bingo hall and had no issues."
Austin,3cp2gt,AUSTIN_ALLCAPS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, I hated the parking over there, too. I had to walk pretty far, and it was pretty sketchy when the show let out."

Investors are coming to Austin to cash in on the new demographic in Austin - young, educated, overpaid, mostly white people working in tech.  These are the people who drive Austin's economy now.  The thing that attracted this tech industry to Austin in the first place was the music culture.  That culture is being driven out by skyrocketing rents perpetuated by these same investors who've come to cash in.  This is not sustainable because the tech industry is a bubble industry due to burst, and it will happen faster if they drive out the music industry that brought tech companies here in the first place."
Austin,3cp2gt,bikegrrrrl,4,Thu Jul 9 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"The music culture did not attract the tech industry. Tax breaks, a beautiful location, the talent pool that is Texas, and a world-class university attracted the tech industry. I wrote a thesis on exactly what you're talking about.

Five minutes poking mouth breathers with a figurative stick is a sport I indulge in while taking a coffee break, and believe me, it doesn't take any mental or physical effort, and is only mildly more intellectually stimulating than talking to my cat.

When they started building the Palmer  extension, I used to take a shortcut through the part of Palmer that ran between 620 and 1431. It was all graded, but sat for a while before they finished it and was barricaded on both end and wasn't open yet. I would go around the barriers and drive down it as the only other options were going all the way to 183 or I35, so it was a huge time saver.

It's like throwing a neighborhood party, you enjoy when the neighbors show up and you make new friends, you don't enjoy when someone posts it to Facebook how awesome the party is and the whole city rolls in mooching and crashing a nice get-together.  People rationalize that Austin will and is evolving, which is true, but fact of reality is that the awesome place that made it attractive is dead and gone no matter how awesome you think the city now is. It simply is impossible to be as great as it was because that greatness relied on a low population to amenity ratio. Now you simply have exponentially more people all ""me too, me too"" trampling amenities that are natural in nature and simply cannot be duplicated or recreated."

Austin,3cmbet,Patricio_Swayze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define hipsters. Austin always had hipster types, they just weren't called hipsters back then, and they weren't nearly as fucking annoying or consumer driven as today's rendition. But Austin has always had people the were ""cooler than thou"".  1995 was right before things really started to change. Seems like a couple of years after that, the influx of people started, house prices and rents started to rise.  I think we were paying around $300 for rent in '95, sharing a house with my gf, so technically $150 each (though she was only working occasionally, slacker that she was, so I was footing most of the bills)."

Austin,3co8hm,ten6ths,7,Thu Jul 9 13:14:42 2015 UTC,It is. We have tons of these guys out on our property. Good guys (and gals).
Austin,3co8hm,doggod,3,Thu Jul 9 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Yup; almost definitely a rat snake or very similar species. Snake bro eats rats, mice and other vermin."
Austin,3co8hm,ChorizoPig,3,Thu Jul 9 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out, that they do have sharp teeth, and strong jaws.  You might not want to just try and grab one by the middle.  If you piss one off, and it can find some skin, they will bite hard, and twist back and forth just to make it hurt more.  (I learned this growing up in the country, and thinking I'd just grab me a ""harmless"" pet snake.)"
Austin,3co8hm,Tom_Pain,13,Thu Jul 9 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, rat snake. Often gets into attics but does nothing but eat your attic rats and then leaves when they're all gone. Nonvenomous.  The only venomous snakes in this area are cottonmouth (water moccasin), copperheads, coral snake, and several species of rattlesnakes.  I have lived in north/central Tx all my life and have never seen a rattlesnake except in Big Bend.    I have seen the others.  Cottonmouth never lives far away from water, however, a copycat species nerodia also lives near water and mimics cottonmouths.  Well they hiss and strike, but are nonvenomous.  It is POSSIBLE that's a pic of a nerodia.  It is less plausible if you are not very near water.  Copperheads and coral snakes have highly recognizable, vivid coloration.  Rattlesnakes have a rattle- usually.  There are reports of rattle-less rattlesnakes, evolution seems to favor them once humans come into the area because we tend to kill every snake that rattles.  Don't assume a snake is nonvenomous because it doesn't seem like one of these.  Variants are possible, like albino, that yields an exception to the appearance, but is still venomous.  There's a really funny Texas species called Eastern Hognose that has a hood like a cobra, stands like a cobra, and strikes aggressively.  It's not a cobra, not even close.  If you annoy it enough, it flips itself over, ejects a stinky musk, and plays dead."
Austin,3co8hm,Oznog99,8,Thu Jul 9 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"The funniest thing about Hognose snakes is that when they play dead, if you roll them back onto their belly, they roll back over and insist that they're dead."
Austin,3co8hm,riboslavin,3,Thu Jul 9 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm dead.  Totally.  See, belly up!  You don't do carrion, do you?  Cause I'm totally carrion."
Austin,3co8hm,Oznog99,3,Thu Jul 9 22:01:01 2015 UTC,Do you even lift carrion brah?!
Austin,3co8hm,owa00,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"I have lived in north/central Tx all my life and have never seen a rattlesnake except in Big Bend.    Really? Because they are out IN FORCE right now in the Hill Country. I am guessing the rain washed out a lot of their burrows but man, its a bit scary in the Bee Cave/Spicewood areas."

Austin,3co8hm,searust,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"Once saw a rattlesnake at my apartment at Davis Lane and Mopac. I think that's the only one I've ever seen locally, which is odd since I've spent a lot of time at various family member's property in the country."
Austin,3co8hm,utspg1980,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"Mostly just run into rat snakes. My chickens have gotten two smaller ones. Torn them to shreds. Which is a shame because the chickens are asleep when the rats are out. One got stuck in my deer fence. Got it out, but it went right back and got stuck again.  Interesting thing about rat snakes is that, if cornered, they'll curl up and beat their tail on the ground, mimicking a rattlesnake. Scared the shit out of me when I ran across the one stuck in my deer fence."
Austin,3co8hm,kayakyakr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:54:32 2015 UTC,"We killed a young rattler on my patio in south Austin.  Since it was small, I figured  there were probably more around.  The neighbor had wood piled up on his side of the fence."

Austin,3co8hm,WesternTrails,8,Thu Jul 9 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"Snakes are a pretty shy bunch, so it's tough to get a great picture without cornering them (which isn't a great idea even with non-venomous snakes). Luckily, even the few nasty ones in our area would rather run than stand off against a human-sized threat.  Without seeing much of the head or tail, the two features to look at would be the belly color and the pattern.  The stripe running the length of it makes me think we're seeing blotches that just aren't particularly defined on top, which makes me agree with /u/ten6ths guess of a rat snake: http://www.austinreptileservice.net/blotches.html  Should be a total bro. They can get aggressive when they're on the hunt, but they don't pose a threat to anything larger than a rat. They can get a little adventurous and climb trees and stuff, but when they're that active they can't afford to hang out where there's not much food, so he'll either take care of mouse problem you didn't know you had or move on.  Lucky find!"
Austin,3co8hm,jenilynTX,2,Thu Jul 9 13:35:14 2015 UTC,Looks like a rat snake to me.
Austin,3co8hm,Pleroo,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"We had a lot of rat snakes as well as nerodia (we live on a creek) but then two hawks moved in and cleaned the place out.  Once the rodents were all eaten, I'm pretty sure the hawks turned their appetites to the snakes themselves.  Circle of life."
Austin,3co8hm,ThickPrick,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"Agree with rat snake.  They sometimes end up on my back porch on hot days, which I learned when my kid stepped out back and got bit by one that had sidled up to cool off on the concrete under the door.   Not poisonous, can get very big."

Austin,3cnzc9,rftek,3,Thu Jul 9 11:35:09 2015 UTC,"Heck yes!  It's easily become one of my favorite past times since the course opened a few years back.  If you have played soccer or even kickball, I'm sure you will love it.  I've even played with people who have never really played ""kicking"" sports and they loved it as well.  It's a very inclusive game, most people can give it a shot.    The holes at Harvey Penick range from like 60 yds to almost 200 yds I think.  There are definitely some long holes.  If you're nice they will let you take out a cart, just be respectful.  They typically want the footgolfers to walk, since the cart paths aren't really designed for the footgolf course.  The course goes along the golf course but they have 18 footgolf holes and a 9 holes golf course, so there is a decent amount of crossing, but as long as you keep a good pace you should be fine.    Also remember, NO CLEATS, they tear up the greens and fairways.  and use proper GOLF ETIQUETTE.  If you've every golfed before or even played disc golf it's pretty similar."
Austin,3cnzc9,funkmastamatt,2,Thu Jul 9 13:40:10 2015 UTC,any chance you could describe what footwear you were using ? just regular tennis shoes? or did you wear golf like shoes to play?  I'm looking to plan an outing next week and want to be sure we adhere to the rules etc ! Do you remember what the pricing looked like?
Austin,3cnzc9,pyrosol08,4,Thu Jul 9 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"When I play I wear a pair of indoor soccer shoes, but that's just because I have them from, well, playing indoor soccer.  My friends play in everything from tennis shoes to soccer ""turf shoes"" and trainers.  I wouldn't recommend golf spikes, they wouldn't really help you any.  Shoes with some grip are good, cus the grass can get kind of slippery, but just cleats are against the rules, since they can do some serious damage to the course.    On weekends I think it's $12 per person/round.  During the week I it's like $10.  I bring my own ball, but I believe they have a few for rent, but they might charge you to rent them, I'm not sure."
Austin,3cnzc9,funkmastamatt,2,Thu Jul 9 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, was lots of fun. Group of 3 of us played a while back. We had all played soccer for years growing up so was a good time. I imagine it could be a little rough if you haven't kicked a ball in a while as the holes are a good distance away."

Austin,3cnzc9,suburban-dad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"Yea.  Definitely a fun game, especially if you're decent with a soccer ball.  If you're not used to golf courses, be sure to bring some water and some sunscreen and/or a hat.  It's pretty hot out there.  Have fun!  I went with a group of 6 dudes.  I think we played the whole course in about 2.5 hrs?  I would recommend not waiting for each person to play their ball.  Just all play at once and be mindful of one another.  It makes the game move much faster."
Austin,3cnzc9,kl0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:31:12 2015 UTC,"I totally recommend it. I've played a few times with friends. It's a blast. Like others have said, bring bug spray. Harvey Penick is full of mosquitoes. It's a great way to spend a few hours and everyone enjoys it since it's pretty unique."
Austin,3cnzc9,gigatron40,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:07:01 2015 UTC,was there this past weekend - Course overall is still in decent shape given the flooding. The one area where it is evident is around the cup. You may have to manipulate the cup slightly side to side to avoid having a huge lip to climb over when putting. Please go out and support this program! i know they are really trying to drive some traffic right now and if this gets taken away from us i will throw a fucking fit. we usually bring a small cooler and few beers to split too.

Austin,3cpv0q,shut_up_josh,3,Thu Jul 9 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"FWIW, after 15 years of mowing several acres, I've found it's just as easy (especially factoring in expense/trouble to sharpen) to buy a new blade every year. I bought a multi pack last year from amazon for a $6 each.  *But I thrash my blades. I do sharpen my ax with this (fun fact, Austin company): http://www.amazon.com/AccuSharp-1-001-Knife-Sharpener/dp/B00004VWKQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436474578&sr=8-2&keywords=knife+sharpener"
Austin,3cpv0q,doggod,3,Thu Jul 9 20:42:06 2015 UTC,I do mine a few times a season with a metal file.  It seems like it's sharpening it and feels like it helps for a few mows at least.  Are the blades you purchased mulching blades?
Austin,3cpv0q,Captain___Obvious,3,Thu Jul 9 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"That's how I was taught...it's actually insanely easy to do, and doesn't even take long.  Lock the blade in a vice and sharpen it with a metal file.  Used to do that once per year on our mowers...it does actually make a difference.  Kinda hate the idea of just buying a new one every year.  That's a bit wasteful...not a fan of throwaway culture, etc."
Austin,3cpv0q,BaldassAntenna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:11:01 2015 UTC,How many times can you sharpen them?  Is it difficult at all to keep the blade balanced after sharpening them several times?  If I can make something last I'm all for not throwing them away from both a cost and sustainability perspective.
Austin,3cpv0q,BaldassAntenna,2,Thu Jul 9 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"From my own experiences, many, many times.  You're not removing much material from them when you sharpen them...it's a bit like sharpening a knife.  It would take a LOT to consume it that way.  As for balance, you'll probably end up taking about the same number of passes on each side with the file...without even trying.  Any difference in balance would be negligible...again...you're only removing a tiny amount of material to give it a sharp edge back.  I haven't looked, but I'd bet there are videos on youtube that would show you how to do it.  I use that a LOT when learning how to do various repairs and stuff of that nature."
Austin,3cpv0q,doggod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, I really appreciate the response.  I'll definitely give youtube a look before attempting, that's where I learned how to replace the brakes on my car and saved a lot of money with that.  Thanks again."

Yet, somehow, lots of people drive and get insurance.  Car manufacturers put in sophisticated computers that could go terribly wrong, yet they somehow remain insured and continue making cars.   More likely future is you won't be able to find an insurance company willing to insure you to manually drive a car."
Austin,3cjqjd,ten6ths,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"As a part of the self driving routines, the car will keep very detailed logs of everything that happens around it.  Any collisions they have are probably the best documented collisions ever, even better than those with multiple dash cams, and there should be no doubt about what happened.  If the device did turn out to be at fault, Google would probably use that data to improve their software, and it would probably result in an insurance payout like any other.    Now, google is a big company with deep pockets, and this is a very new thing, so people will probably try to sue them and get rich off of any collision that is deemed to not be their fault (and even some of those that are), though I imagine that this will fail unless somebody is seriously injured or killed.  And if somebody is seriously injured or killed, well, we'll see what happens -- hopefully the courts won't make too big of a distinction between existing collisions with commercial vehicles (i.e. deep pockets) and these self driving vehicles.  And once these become commonplace, I imagine that the courts will treat flaws in the self-driving routines just like they treat flaws in cars today, like the Toyota sticking throttle issue or the exploding Pintos -- with lawsuits and recalls.  (Though most recalls on a self driving car would probably just be a software update, one that could probably be completed with the car at home.)  edit: to answer your questions more directly ...  If this car has a collision or gets pulled over by a cop today, the guy who was in charge of it will get the ticket.  There is no provision in current law to ticket anybody but the guy in control of the car.  Having the car drive without a driver at all is not supported by the law, so that would be illegal by itself, but if they tried and it was pulled over for something, then the person in charge of the car would get two tickets -- the one for letting the car drive by itself and one for being responsible for whatever else happened.  In the future, before self-driving cars start being used without professional drivers watching everything, the laws will have to be adjusted, and it's hard to tell what form exactly they'll take.  I suspect that cars will still have insurance, though given how good these things are so far at avoiding accidents (and proving that they weren't the cause of the ones that still happen), insurance rates will probably be low, as long as the car can't be or is rarely driven manually.  If a human overrides the computer and makes it break a traffic law, that human will probably get any tickets, and the computer will probably have detailed logs showing what happened.  If the computer does screw up, the owner will probably get any ticket and have to pay any damages caused, but Google may have a program where if the problem really is a flaw in the computer that they'll cover the damages.  Maybe.  And once a ticket gets on its robot record, it's probably going to be there forever.  But we'll probably cut it some slack once it can prove that it has been rehabilitated ..."

We are VERY lucky to have it here as this will bring people from around the world to attend.
Austin,3ck37t,Bad-Machine,4,Wed Jul 8 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"Dreamhack is more about just eSports.  It's a LAN, major eSports tournament with multiple titles, expo, and music fest."

Austin,3ck37t,shiruken,9,Wed Jul 8 16:37:27 2015 UTC,Here's a great Wikipedia article about Esports: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports  It's competitive video games that people watch.

Austin,3ck37t,MrMooMooDandy,5,Thu Jul 9 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"I've never been to anything like this, but, I'm STOKED that it's in Austin.  I'll definitely be bringing my PC setup to play some Dota 2.  Anyone have any suggestions with how to lock down your PC / Monitor setup so that it doesn't get stolen?"
Austin,3ck37t,What_time_is_it1234,4,Wed Jul 8 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"This used to be my biggest hobby, so I've been to maybe 15 or so huge events like this. It's typically not an issue. People keep an eye out, and there's usually an equipment check-in/check-out system to prevent people from just walking out with someone else's rig, but if you wanted to you could pick up some Kensington Locks. Get a cable with a looped end and loop it through a closed section of the table leg (so it can't be slipped off). This, of course, depends on you having the Kensington slot on your case and monitor. Some do, some don't.   Some of us also used to have little padlock tabs on our computer cases to prevent someone from pulling the side of the case off to steal peripherals. I was a lot more worried about someone swiping my video card than them stealing my entire system. They could easily install my video card in their own rig and avoid getting caught at equipment check-out. I think getting your mouse/keyboard/mousepad/headphones stolen is even more likely, so I would also take them with me in my backpack when I left for the night."
Austin,3ck37t,BisonST,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"This is great info - thanks!  I saw the Kensington Locks online earlier today, but don't think my case has a Kensington Slot:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCXF6O4/?tag=pcpapi-20  I might be able to thread the security cable through the holes in the back of the case, but, not sure what I'd affix it to, since I don't have anywhere to put the end into...  Great to know about the equipment check-in/check-out systems."

Austin,3ck37t,BombGeek,6,Wed Jul 8 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yep. I went to QuakeCon for about 7 years straight and maybe 6-7 big CPL events, never had anything stolen myself. I'd heard about it happening, but it wasn't as common as some may think. I think most people keep an eye out for the rigs around them, whether they know the owners or not.   17-20 year old me would have been super stoked about a big lan like this coming to Austin, but there was some age between then and now where moving my computer across the room, let alone across town, became too much of a burden."

Austin,3ck37t,autobahn,2,Wed Jul 8 19:30:45 2015 UTC,It is now official we have a festival or convention every weekend of the year now!
Austin,3ck37t,bawlz_,8,Thu Jul 9 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"pretty much. well that and the PAX events/E3.  Dreamhack is probably the biggest that's focused on actual playing of games though.  My big issue is that these events are pretty much all ""MOBAs+CSGO"". Makes me a little sad because LAN parties used to be about playing new and different things. But because they're ""esports"" now, it's a lot less about fun and a lot more about competition."
Austin,3ck37t,autobahn,4,Wed Jul 8 15:35:47 2015 UTC,Who told you competition isn't fun? Isn't that why football and basketball are multi-billion dollar sports? I don't understand haha.
Austin,3ck37t,jeffwhat,4,Wed Jul 8 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"well that's the whole point of gaming, but I'm speaking more of capital-C Competition. As in, brackets, and shit. I just want to play and have fun. But the focus seems to be only on ""esports"" games.   It makes it a little less of a ""yay let's get together and have fun"" type of thing."
Austin,3ck37t,blind512,3,Wed Jul 8 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but I think it's great what competition has brought to the spectacle that is ""esports"". If it was just about fun LANS, then just plan a small group event with your friends or something. But if Dreamhack wants to throw huge cons on this level, they need big ticket events & brackets you can only get from a heavily competitive arena game. think Rosebowl, or PGA tours, or even just the NBA dunk contests or Homerun Derbys. not always for money, but competitions all the same."

Austin,3ck37t,owa00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:58:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, they were always e-sports related in how they were promoted. The QuakeCon/CPL events I went to over the years were always CS, Quake, AvP2, or Painkiller oriented, but in the BYOC people were playing all kinds of random games. Some of the most fun I've ever had at a LAN was playing the first Serious Sam at the QuakeCon right after it came out.  I think there will always be those competitive people who want to win the tournament and only want to practice the title game, but they are a very very small minority. Especially when teams get eliminated, not very many of them go back to the BYOC and continue setting up scrimmages against other teams in the competition game."
Austin,3ck37t,Ninja_Niner,3,Wed Jul 8 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"All my life I've wanted to go to one.  I used to have Lan parties of red alert,  Diablo,  war craft at my place.  The nostalgia is hitting me hard."

Ok, that sounds legit.   Tyrie Ockleberry, 17, is charged with resisting search.       Resisting search ... is that even a crime?   Ahmad Valdez-Carter, 17, is charged with evading arrest.       No charges for what he's being arrested for, only for resisting that arrest?   Winzell Washington, 17, is charged with failure to identify.       Why would he have to identify if he wasn't under arrest for something else?  (Answer: by Texas law, he would not.  See 38.02.)  That said, it does look like ""Sec. 38.02.  FAILURE TO IDENTIFY"" could apply if the person gave a fictitious name when asked, but unless he gives a false name, you have to be under arrest (for something else) to be charged with this.  (If you're merely detained, even if the cop things you witnessed a crime, you can simply not identify yourself.)"

Austin,3could,sqwertzme,2,Thu Jul 9 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"Do you have or can you borrow/rent a metal detector? There should be metal 'pins' at each corner of your lot that serve as boundary markers. The boundary markers are part of what a surveyor looks for. You can probably find them yourself (although it might be kind of difficult near the vault depending on where the utility lines run.   Alternately, you and your neighbor should both have a survey from when you bought the house. The survey should contain measurements of how far your house is from the property line, and the angle that the line runs at, along with any fences and other items. The transformer may even be shown on this survey.   In my case, I'd note that the last post in the fence in back is approximately 0.2' feet from the boundary marker. That's not good enough to get the property line. However, the property line is 28.4' from the garage wall. I can measure that, drop a stake there and ad the back boundary marker, and then run a rope between the two stakes. If that rope continues, if you've done everything right, it will hit the front boundary marker after a set amount of time.   Knowing where you keep that survey is usually a good idea."
Austin,3could,superspeck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"I have the original plat map for the house but it does not show how far the house is from the property line.  And it only shows generic 5x5' foot utility easements at each corner of the property in front.  It doesn't even show the driveway.    I have looked for survey markers at the edge of the property in the road and in the curb.  I have not seen any in this subdivision and I walk the roads here often.  I assume the neighbors have the same useless kind of property  map we have, too (useless unless you have a surveyor).    Thanks for the suggestions."
Austin,3could,reptaaarrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"Those transformers should sit within those easements, no exceptions. If they're outside the easement, then they'd be encroaching in your property. (All of this is moot if they're within the public right-of-way, though).  In subdivisions, the majority of the time the easement will straddle the property line. Depending where you are in the country, you could find an assortment of markers to define your property. First things first, find out how wide the right-of-way is for your street. If it's 40', then 20' from centerline is the frontage of your property. Back east, most of these corners will be rebar with a plastic cap (PLS designation on top). Out west, lots of places will scribe the curb along the PL line, and the back of curb being built at the approximate PL. It really depends on where you're at."
Austin,3could,reptaaarrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"Problem is I don't know where their (or my) 5-foot easement starts.  And since the neighbors is adjacent to mine, that 3 foot slab could sit anywhere in a 10' x 5' foot area.  And now they've we've been annexed, that 5'x5' easement has presumably been expanded to standard Austin ROW stretching across the front of the property."
Austin,3could,iRTK,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:52 2015 UTC,Do you have an image you can upload of the original plat?
Austin,3could,superspeck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"@sqwertzme hey were you able to get it figured out? If not, if you want to upload a picture of that plat maybe I can help you make sense of it."
Austin,3could,reptaaarrr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"The survey pins will actually be pieces of rebar that are buried, not USGS survey markers that you'd see hiking. You would need a metal detector to find them.   It's strange to me that you only have the plat; my title company required an up to date survey during purchase. Even a new fence is enough to invalidate the previous survey."
Austin,3could,superspeck,2,Fri Jul 10 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"A new fence wouldn't ""invalidate"" a previous boundary survey (Parcel Map or Subdivision Plat) - A standard B&T would really be the only thing that would even refer to a fenceline, and would only be shown as an encroachment if it was one.  NOW.... if you're talking SPECIFICALLY about an ALTA/ACSM Survey (which differs from Parcel Maps and Subdivision Plats, which are actually - with deeds - the controlling documents for a boundary definition), then yes... slight topographic changes have to be recorded on a new survey, as ALTA/ACSM surveys are primarily to show ownership rights/lines of possession/relative position of topo features to the parcel boundary lines. Title company doesn't want to issue a policy on something that may be encroaching upon an adjacent property, or being encroached upon....   As for the markers, like I said it depends. They're supposed to be set flush. They could be rebar/caps, concrete monuments, curb scribes, nail & tags, iron pipes. It'll say on the original subdivision map what was set and what LS# they'll be marked with."
Austin,3could,reptaaarrr,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's a lot of info that I didn't understand before.   (All I know was that prior to closing, either the title company or the lender looked at the survey and looked at the inspector/appraisal report, pointed out that X structure marked on the survey that we got from the previous owner was different, that Y fence had been replaced, and that Z concrete pad was not mentioned at all but is close enough to the property boundary to be of concern) and they made us order a new survey at our cost.)"
Austin,3could,reptaaarrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:11:43 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Right now with a lot of the redevelopment going on across the country (as opposed to flat out new development), ALTA/ACSM surveys are in heavy demand (at least out here they are). Title companies get really anal retentive about the property they're issuing policies on, and rightfully so. It's not a pretty site to see the fallout from one of these where someone missed something (even like you said, a fence line) and the owners from both parties going bananas over it.  Happens all the time."
Austin,3could,sxzxnnx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"The survey markers I've seen in other neighborhood, retail, and commercial areas are large-headed nails, some with intricate designs and something that identifies the surveyor (here's one from Southpark Meadows with your rebar style next to it http://imgur.com/KJTEmdb )  I should note that I am the original owner of this house since it was built and that it was outside the city limits at that time, but has since been incorporated to Austin.   The house next door WAS recently sold and I asked the real estate agent, who also happens to be neighborhood association president, if a survey was done or what we as neighbors should do, but she doesn't want to answer my email (she probably has a three-way conflict of interest, which makes her a shitty choice for neighborhood president)."
