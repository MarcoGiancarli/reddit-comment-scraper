In general, the SEP article on Hedonism has pretty good discussion.    By way of introductory discussion, this kind of objection is probably the most common type of argument used against hedonism, /u/nsdfigaiobio. And while you're right to link utilitarianism and hedonism to some extent (Bentham, generally considered the founder of utilitarianism, was a hedonist, as many other utilitarians have been since), they can come apart quite easily as well, as /u/HeyMadman says. Indeed, you can be an ideal utilitarian or a preference utilitarian (or a combination of both, or something else entirely) and not think that increasing utility necessarily has anything to do with pleasure whatsoever.    That being said, in my experience, intuitions about Nozick's experience machine (and analogous ones about the lotus-eaters) tend to vary wildly, and it's a superb candidate for a more thorough examination of the moral epistemology underlying our moral intuitions."

This whole notion of ""noble"" and ""base"" pleasure is antithetical to that.   I strongly disagree with utilitarianism, but it seems pretty false to say that notions of base and noble pleasures are antithetical to utilitarian thought. JS Mill, one of the most well-known proponents of utilitarianism, talked about the distinction between higher and lower pleasures.  You may have heard the phrase ""Better to be Socrates unsatisfied than a fool satisfied."" That comes from Mill's discussion of this very topic.  The briefest summary I can make about it is that although the lotus-eater might be more content for spending the rest of his days as he is he is not happier, which is something altogether different than contentment.  If you're into utilitarian thought and have not done so, I highly recommend reading Mill.

He says that human beings--the only beings capable of experiencing both kinds of pleasure--prefer noble ones to base ones, so noble pleasures much be better and more pleasurable. But surely all human beings don't necessarily and categorically prefer noble pleasures to base ones? Of those who have experienced both and prefer the baser, Mill says they are mentally defective and never have really preferred the baser, but have been somehow corrupted into losing the capacity to even feel the nobler, which rules them out as ""competent judges"" of their own experience, leaving only those human beings who prefer noble pleasures to base ones as the competent judges, who, of course, will judge that noble pleasures are preferable to base ones."
askphilosophy,3e3kn4,LiterallyAnscombe,9,Tue Jul 21 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"I look at this as sort of the reason I don't drink myself into a stupor every day. It sounds fun, and I do love that lightness of being and pain free feeling that I get after a few drinks, but I would then be unable to perform my responsibilities, and would probably neglect my children. If, at the end of my life, I have managed to not fall to crippling alcoholism, I will probably look back at my life, and think of all the great times I had with my family and friends. I will probably not look back and wish that I had been in a drunken stupor more often.  If, at the end of my life, I have given into to the temptation, and spent a good amount of my time in drunken happiness, assuming any of my family will still have anything to do with me, I can't see myself looking back with anything other than regret. At that point I'll probably pour myself another drink to try to drive away those feelings away, and maybe even die in a happy drunken stupor, but the point remains that one of these futures is more desirable to me right now than the other, and I obligated to seek that happier future.   Obligation to family, to society, to the future, and to happiness itself is more than just a burden that we bear, it is what makes our lives worth living. Without these obligations, without the things which we use to bring meaning to an existence that could easily be viewed as pointless against the immense void of empty universe, we really would have no better option than to become lotus-eaters. And so, the lotus-eater is not someone who has found a shortcut to happiness, and is living a burden free life, but someone who has given up on the search for meaning, and has accepted that life is not really worth living."
askphilosophy,3e3kn4,Audioasis,3,Tue Jul 21 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"Nietzsche would say that they do have the happiness which most people settle for, but by denying the faculty of memory (which has typically been the interpretation of what the lotus does to them) they are alienated by self-overcoming and a full range of their spirit in their lifetime.  In the essay ""On the Use and Disadvantages of History for Life"" he addresses that lifestyle (comparing it to cattle) also criticizes excessive reliance on memory, saying that humans absolutely need to be able to remember, judge themselves and feel pain, but also to need to be able to forget in order to find authentic action for themselves to do in the world rather than being hung up on guilt and false senses of loyalty.  As to utilitarianism, this is largely part of the assumptions that Nietzsche is struggling against, that happiness is to be defined as the bare minimum that the most humans can enjoy. On the other hand, he does accept (and most people hate him for it) that a lot of people will be happy living on the bottom of the spiritual ladder and satisfied with easy answers, and that this need not trouble us terribly."

askphilosophy,3e3kn4,kilkil,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Hedonism and Utilitarianism  This is probably one of the strongest objections against hedonism, which I'll define as the view that an action is right iff it produces more pleasure than pain, where pain and pleasure are the common-sense psychological brain states.  If you can prove that eating lotuses actually causes more pleasure than pain, then it must be right on hedonic accounts.  Their responses, though, could range.   First, they could bite the bullet. They could say, ""Look, maybe in the world of the Odyssey, if there is this miracle plant or drug, and if those people really enjoy eating it, then that's OK. But it's also still right for Odysseus to resist because he gets pleasure (more?) from other things, including returning to Ithaca.""  Second, they could say, ""Yeah, OK. But the lotus doesn't actually exist in our world. And here's why ..."" The idea would be that they can say that no pleasure is perfect in human life right now. (Another literary example would be Aldous Huxley's ""soma"" from A Brave New World.) Take heroin, for example, there are huge physiological pains associated with withdrawal, potential run-ins with the cops, and complications from administering the drug long-term. Even something like dopamine (which isn't just something you can consume and expect to work) alters brain chemistry in a way that changes many physiological and psychological reactions. You have to consider the whole scope of the action. And when you do, the lotus objection is no more plausible than the lotus.  I find the second response most compelling for them. If you're a hedonist, you're likely going to reject complicated metaphysics. You opt for hedonism (usually) because it's a simple theory. Increase pleasure; decrease pain. You don't import some special sense of human nature or intrinsically good pleasures to save yourself. But that is the next option.  Aristotelian or Mixed Good Theories  Aristotle would say that ""happiness"" (eudaimonia) is very different from ""pleasure"" (hedone). Humans are the types of animals that have rational capacities and intricate social ties. Humans have capacities that, in their complete development, require physical, mental, social, and ""spiritual"" training. It's implausible that the lotus eaters are able to achieve this type of development. They might develop in a physical sense (assuming they aren't gluttons that immobilize and die of heart disease or diabetes). But they definitely don't develop into a society of beings who develop right reason, emotion, and virtuous dispositions.  Mill, taking a page from Aristotle, tried to introduce is higher/lower pleasures distinction. It's a matter of controversy as to what exactly he meant here. But, reading Homer's Odyssey and really dissecting it to understand why it bears on our lives is a high pleasure. It is of a different sort (some how) than a lower pleasure, like reading Fifty Shades of Gray and rubbing a few out. There's something about (a) how the higher pleasure is different intrinsically or (b) how our nature interacts with that pleasure during its activity that makes it better. The question then becomes: Well, how much more? If it's a matter of magnitudes, no amount of lotus eating will equal slogging through Homer. But if it's only a matter of degree, maybe you'd have to eat lotus for a few years to get the pleasures of a semester of Homer at college. If that's the case, then it might seem more plausible to reach for Homer instead of a lotus.  Looming problem of objectivity  This only matters insofar as there's some reality to what a pleasure is. If you're a subjectivist (and think that pleasure or happiness is really a matter that varies by person), then you have to take each person for what they're worth. Maybe you could establish something like standards of rationality (but where do those standards come from?). Ultimately, though, you have to say that for the reflective and endorsing lotus eater, it is right for him/her to do that.  If you're an objectivist of sorts about what is pleasurable or painful or happiness-inspiring, then you have to say what the standard is and why it's right. Some Aristotelians think they can do that based on a loose concept of human nature. Just in the same way we'd say that a giraffe with three legs or no tongue is stunted or malformed in some sense, we'd probably say that a person who does not develop in the right way is also stunted. So if lotus eating infringes upon this objective nature, and if you think that objective nature is correct, then that's why eating it is bad. Caveat: Greeks were no prudes. They weren't ascetic. Eudiamonia is a holistic concept. So to say that someone who neglects everything to pursue lotus is obviously bad. But someone who can maintain good standing in the polis, develop their minds and bodies, etc., but does some lotus every now and again, I don't think there's a way to say that's bad on the Aristotelian account.  If you like this type of stuff, I'd look into research on ""goods"" or ""intrinsic goods"" or ""the good life"" or ""human nature."" Maybe some stuff on the ""meaning of life"" might be good. I'd start with Aristotle (De Anima and Nicomachean Ethics), maybe thumb through some Epicurus. But hopefully those terms will get you started. Susan Wolf also has a relatively recent volume Meaning in Life and Why It Matters, which has not only some relevant stuff from her, but also some great responses by psychologists.  If you want something more contemporary, I'd look at Mill scholars' responses to the higher/lower debate. I'd especially check out authors like David O. Brink, Jonathan Riley, and Christoph Schmidt-Petri.  Best of luck! Feel free to hit me back with any questions."
askphilosophy,3e3kn4,blackheartblackmask,2,Wed Jul 22 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my answer:  From their perspective, it makes no sense. They want to continue eating lotus; to them, not eating lotus is a bad thing.   From your perspective, it is bad; and (from your persoective), it doesn't matter whether it makes them happy or not. Pulling them out makes you happier, because you believe it is better for them.   This way of thinking, when you think about it, can be used to deny pretty much any want or desire that someone else has. The idea that wants are separate from needs is something that is widely accepted, but the main problem comes from determining what exactly a person's needs are.  Personally, I'd leave the lotus eaters be. The only way I'd interfere is if it were to appear to me that their physical or mental health were at risk. If I couldn't tell, and if I had literally no way of finding out (like, at all), then I would have no justifiable reason for interfering, so I would leave them be."

If someone were to hand me a pill that would kill me instantly and painlessly, I would have to decide between death (a neutral state) or life (a state that could be good, bad, or neutral, depending on my experiences). You can't just say that the loss of potential life is trivial since it doesn't matter to the dead individual; you have to look at the other state as well, and if that could potentially be better. If it could be better, it's not that death is bad, it's just less good."
askphilosophy,3e4955,linguinee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:13:49 2015 UTC,"Death isn't less good just because life is good, death is still nothing. You can't compare it to life in that way. Good and bad arise from the ability to experience good and bad, which is why death can't be less good. You cannot experience the loss of potential life in death.   You did somewhat touch on something often associated with death that does matter and does account for the potential of life, which is your awareness of death. If you kill a human in front of another human, you're altering their awareness of life and death. If someone gives you a pill that will kill you instantly and painlessly, you are aware of your potential death if you ingest the pill.   If however, someone slips something into your drink and it's 100% impossible for you to detect, and if you have no awareness about people slipping such drugs into other people's drinks, then presumably there is no loss felt from your end and you weren't suffering. You would die without knowing that you were going to die, without fearing you were going to die. If you knew that this was a practice that was employed to get rid of people for various reasons, then your awareness of it causes you undue harm.

Or in the case of war, people draw a moral distinction between the use of chemical and conventional weapons.

I like your analogy about the death penalty but where I think it fails is that supporters of the death penalty are in favor of killing because they think it achieves justice. We do not kill animals because of justice, we do it out of enjoyment. You have also given other cases in which killing humans is morally acceptable. Again, I agree that there are cases in which it is ok to kill both humans and animals. However, there is never a situation in which it is ok to kill humans for enjoyment.

Demanding consent as a necessity for morality in this case would render all life immoral. For now unfortunately, we still need to kill to survive.  A person needs about 70 grams of protein a day just to survive. My math is probably a bit ( a lot ) off, but to give you some idea I think we would need to produce somewhere around 490,000 metric tons of edible and digestible protein a day to feed seven billion people (No  I'm not factoring in vegetarian cultures). That's an insane task.    We are entering an age however, where things like synthetic meat and more advanced sources of protein are becoming more affordable and available. Soon, the question of the suffering of our food animals may become a moot point. It can't happen fast enough in my opinion.   Right at this moment, it's impossible for humanity to survive without eating meat for a number of reasons. Namely, the technology and the infrastructure just isn't there.

No, there's definitely people who deny responsibility because they deny that free will exists.  Even Harris, who you mention in the OP, does this--though he's inconsistent about it, so you could quote one or another passage of his supporting either view.

We have to know more about what your professor means to be completely certain, but perhaps he was referring to this passage in A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right:   It is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force, but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses. Theory is capable of seizing the masses when it demonstrates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself."

I also think Kaufman's edition is great because of his introduction and the commentary he provides throughout.

There are people who criticize him for being non-literal and seeking to capture Nietzsche's voice instead of the exact words that he used (and there are points where this is fair), but his works are the most readable translations of Nietzsche, and there are definitely times where they're better in terms of literality than more recent attempts.

It's a brisker, easier read than Nietzsche's earlier works, and it's an excellent introduction to many concepts important to his philosophy. Let Zarathustra hook you, then read Gay Science, Genealogy, etc., and then come back to Zarathustra once again for a new and deeper experience. You could just return to it eternally, really — it's that good."
askphilosophy,3e38ey,Sluggo57,6,Tue Jul 21 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"It's bad advice to start with TSZ. While it's a fascinating read, it's a horrible introduction to his concepts for the very straightforward reason that it doesn't introduce any. Rather it elaborates thematically on a host of ideas that were introduced and developed in his earlier works.  Lots of undergrads like to start with TSZ because it seems like Nietzsche's 'sexiest' and most aphoristic work, which perhaps it is. But they also tend to have the most skewed and arbitrary interpretations."
askphilosophy,3e38ey,pimpbot,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"In what sense is ""elaborat[ing] thematically on a host of ideas"" not an introduction to those ideas? I suspect that you're privileging Nietzsche's other works because, in your estimation, they are written in a more ""straightforward"" style, whatever that means. But precisely because Zarathustra is a philosophical novel, I would argue that its introductions of concepts like eternal recurrence and, especially, the transvaluation of value are in fact much more palatable for a neophyte than something like Gay Science, which — perhaps you've forgotten — consists entirely of aphorisms and songs.  And for what it's worth, given your apparent belief that I'm an undergrad (and, moreover, that undergrads' opinions on Nietzsche are inherently ""skewed and arbitrary""), I have a master's degree in political theory and teach philosophy at a prep school."
askphilosophy,3e2cde,HStakes7,10,Tue Jul 21 12:32:46 2015 UTC,"Could it be that conviction stops a thinking mind?   Only if by 'conviction' we mean stubbornly adhered to ideas that aren't properly critically examined by us regardless of how often we're challenged on them. However, that need not be the only meaning of 'conviction'; an attitude that is reflected upon, genuinely questioned by oneself, and then affirmed with all of one's being should be respectable when it really does occur (which may indeed be quite rare these days - there are apparently far more ideologues and propagandists, among which the SSA is no doubt included, than persons with profound convictions). After all, no matter how rationally we articulate our worldviews, at some point acts of will must be employed to affirm them; better we hold them deliberately, responsibly, and with resolve than otherwise.   After a while I recalled a quote from Nietzsche ""Convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies.""   Nietzsche's aphorism has ironic layers to it. It could be taken straightforwardly to mean that those who adhere to their (so-called) convictions merely muddy the waters, but keeping in mind that 'truth' has several meanings for Nietzsche, one of them negative (in that 'truth' as the search for a singular objective Truth of existence was in fact the catalyst for the age of nihilism, while the notion that there is such a Truth is abused as a destructive power-play by whatever the dominant ideology of the day happens to be). So a person with true convictions (one who has organized their whole self and world around creative acts of willing that express their most profound passions, organically giving rise to authentic personhood) would indeed be the most dangerous adversary of this 'truth', as such a person stands autonomous above the war of mass-ideologies armed with her personally-crafted convictions."

In many cases these people and the people they consider thought leaders actively disparage and view with disdain or hostility the very academic field that critically analyzes these arguments. So I'm not sure how this is different to what religious people in churches or mosques are purportedly doing.   People like these tend to say things like the scientific method is objective, but then so is deductive logic. No Christian or Muslim theologian denies if you stay within the axioms or foundational beliefs of their world-view you can produce new inferences or discourse or debate. It's their refusal to question their foundational beliefs that is viewed as irrational.   ""Religion stops a thinking mind.""   I don't think starting with the prior assumption that people who don't share the same worldview as you are somehow defective in their cognition, is a good way to engage with others. I think people who grew up during the Cold War for instance, necessarily will have quite different views about science and atheism than the people who are members of the SSA. I'm not a empiricist or materialist or positivist for instance but I don't think the people who adhere to these views are necessarily irrational or have stopped thinking.   Could it be that conviction stops a thinking mind? It seems to me that atheists are just as susceptible to conviction as believers.   I think it is sort of a moot point because all of us have convictions that we will never relinquish. Being convinced of something in the absence of evidence or even presence of contradictory evidence seems quite necessary for humans to create new knowledge or inventions or act morall. We don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with mathematicians or scientists or inventors who labour their whole lives in pursuit of the solution to some intractable problem or failed idea or theory. And certain convictions like ""All men are equal."" or ""Justice is more important than wealth."" we all consider to be foundational and indefeasible."

Whether it's a bad thing is a more complicated question.  Pretty much any philosopher is likely going to lean towards saying we shouldn't have conviction in the sense of not examining one's beliefs, because philosophy is pretty much just a rigorous examination of beliefs that other people take for granted.

One must prove their own convictions to themselves.  One must re-examine this line of reasoning. It so happens that one's initial line of reasoning might have been flawed, or fallacious in some way. If one doesn't notice at first, perhaps one will notice later. If one does notice cracks and flaws in their line of reasoning, they must start from scratch, and see if they can correct for the fallacies and biases and still arrive at the same conclusion.

Well, humans can do lots of things. It's not ""intuitive"" at all that simply because humans can do something that it can be replicated by an automated system. Perhaps you mean to imply that the practice of science is circumscribed or limited in some qualitative fashion that makes it more amenable to automation. But that is a highly dubious proposition for many reasons (one which you mention - the fact that it seems rather difficult, if not impossible, to codify the so-called methodology of science).  Furthermore you mention interpretation. That is a whole other can of worms that poses very tricky problems for codified emulation, one reason being that interpretation is an action that one engages in relative to a context (often including cultural elements). It seems like it would be far easier for an automated system to make empirical observations than it would be for an automated system to interpret those observation, in large part because that would be a fair description of how we interact with our information-gathering machines today, for example in the context of space exploration. The probes ""observe"", while the humans interpret.  Ultimately, you're really just asking about the possibility of strong AI. Limiting the function to science isn't much of a practical limitation since the practice of science draws extensively on a broad range of what, up until now at least, has been exclusively human endeavor."

I'm not going to call you a liar about your own personal perspective. My point is only that it's really not intuitive to the vast majority of people, and it is especially not intuitive to most of the people who think about these sorts of matters in philosophy of science. So it's wrong to say that it's ""intuitive"" in general because it's not. It's something that needs to be painstakingly argued for, and presumably an awareness of that fact is what lead you to ask your question in the first place.  Lastly, simply because something is possible 'in principle' (i.e. given infinite time and resources) doesn't mean it's possible in practice given our practical limitations. I mean, maybe I think that it's possible to construct a Dyson sphere in principle. Do I think that we're ever going to? Not really."

The sorts of things that this approach has a great deal difficulty in capturing are the subjective elements of human experience - e.g. the valuing, desiring, hoping, fearing, etc. The future-oriented-ness. Someone like me is going to want to say that those things are elements of human activity properly understood, including scientific practice.

There are obvious reasons when dealing with the Shoah (some of the descriptions of camp life from testimony's have kept me up at night) but in the light of very current reasons its troubling to talk about Heidegger's ontology and use it as a tool to describe the camp. Gregory Weiss's new book about Heidegger's Schwartze Hefte has made everything very errr complicated.

The awkwardness I was referring to is how recently its been made explicit how tied up in anti-Semitism parts of Heidegger's ontology is. For Agamben writing in 1999 I get the impression that it was a lot easier to separate the corrupt man from his philosophy?  I'd love to hear any thoughts regarding that because its something that's changed since I've been climbing the academic ladder.  I remember in a graduate seminar a lecturer having spoken at length about the use of the word dwelling and emerging and its use in Heidgger's Imaginary. In particular describing its relevance to the Black Forest and his long walk's within it. Everyone was very fed up with the pomposity of it, so one kid pipes up pointing out the obscenity of if on one of these rambles Heidegger might have found a clearing which contained the horrors of Sobibor or Belzec.

I see similarities between Agamben's theory that to experience potentiality and thus be free one must also possess impotential which, to summarise, political structures with-hold from and Heidegger's theme's of 'being-toward' and 'the they' with-holding us from truly coming to terms with Death as the possibility of impossibilities. (this seems like a ramble now, I'm wondering if it actually makes sense?)  But ofcourse without actually knowing Agamben I'm not sure if I'm going down the completely wrong route! It sparked my interest though. I have no background at all in any political philosophy (vaguely know Marx but that's all!) so yeah, I thought I'd indulge myself and begin with Agamben.

I would say the they of das Man is something we are abandoned to, in our throwness in-the-world. But what is important to Agamben is that we are at least world-ed, we are not objects. For Heidegger that seems to be enough, for that is the space in which authenticity is created. Now, what initially struck me about Agamben is his emergence of the idea that the polis creates by necessity these states of places-without-place, that is at a basic level- an area where the rules of subjectivity doesn’t exist. So we can talk about prisons and the like, but those are places of punishment, Punishment requires a witness and a collective satisfaction. So as bad as it is, you are still world-ed.  The Camp is not somewhere where you are punished. You are there so/because you don’t exist. Indeed he reflects that “In Auschwitz, people did not die, rather corpses where produced. Corpses without death, non-humans whose de-cease is de-based into a matter of serial production…”. 2.18  Indeed he evokes a curious example here of an interview with Hannah Arendt where she reflects that many who were witnesses ( a word which is very much explored in Agamben’s work) both victims and perpetrators have said that what happened in the camp “ought not to have happened”.  I mean, when your talking about something so hideous it seems like a true-ism, but what Agamben discovers is that the “it” that “ought not to have happened” wasn't murder (which historically is nothing new), the “it” is this hideous assemblage of the fabrication of the dead, as they were declared not dead but non-human before they were even brought to the camp. For Agamben I suppose, something escaped from the camp in that moment, Indeed in a haunting passage he states:  “The conciliatory advice of every theodicy (God on trial) is particularly clear here. Not only does this theodicy tell us nothing about Auschwitz, either about its victims or executioners it does not even manage to avoid a happy ending. Behind the powerless of God peeps the powerlessness of men, who continue to cry “Never Again”, when it is clear that “That” is, by now, everywhere.” 1.5 pg 20   This tension between being world-ed and yet being made forcibly without-world creates a legal grey zone, one that's materiality is often difficult to describe, but one that Agamben identifies again and again in political structures.

It would seem that some things are relative, and some other things are not.   If there is no absolute perception, how can we be sure that anything other than ourself is absolutely real?   I don't know how ""absolute perception"" differs from ""perception"" or how ""absolutely real"" differs from ""real"", but I imagine we can be sure things other than ourselves are real through our experience of them, or through their effects on other things we experience, or through other well-founded inferences."

Your argument seems to me a rather different one: a skeptical concern about how even if we have excellent reasons to believe something, it may not be true.  Except that you haven't clearly stated your argument, you've only asserted that the consensus may be an illusion.  Ok, let's agree that it may--so what?  Apparently you mean to say that if it may be an illusion, we don't have rational grounds for believing it isn't an illusion.  That is, apparently your principle is: if it's logically possible that X is false, then we cannot have rational grounds for believing X is true.  The problem with this argument is that that seems like an eminently silly principle, and once we reject it, the rest of your argument falls.

That job involved collecting a lot of health, sociology, and anthropological reports on a specific topic (say, smoking). The idea was that law-makers need to know what research is out there when debating certain potential policies, but they don't have the time to sort through all the primary sources. My friend's consulting firm basically analyzed and summarized the research.  She finds the job really rewarding, and her humanities background is essential to the job. Also, she gets paid very well to do it.  It's just one anecdote, I realize, but it's a promising one.  The other option is, if you wanna teach, to take that degree abroad to be an ESL instructor. If you have some TA experience from your degree, you might be positioned nicely to get a university job in Korea (where I work now).

askphilosophy,3e12vx,CaptainAhoitheFirst,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:27 2015 UTC,I did my M.A. in philosophy around 4 years ago. Since then I work at a global company in the field of sustainability. At university I focussed on business ethics and looked for internships in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility or Sustainability.  In my eyes the focus of your studies determine the jobs you might get. u/inpasadena said that writing is an option. I don't think that would work just by having a M.A. in philosophy. You will need to write and you will need to do internships while studying just to get chance in that field.
askphilosophy,3e12vx,filosophikal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:26 2015 UTC,"Job opportunities are very limited if you exclude teaching. Perhaps another question to ask is about how you can make your M.A. in philosophy relevant to whatever work/life you have from here on out. After I got my M.A., and spent a few years pondering a direction while I did some personal research, I wound up taking a job as an R&D project manager for a company that invented new ways of teaching. I was lucky that there were some opportunities to directly express my philosophy background in this work in interesting ways, but not enough to consider it a job related to my education.   I was eventually reduced to writing on the internet about philosophy. I got lucky and my writing started showing up on the first page of Google for the right searches with the result that my work is now being used in academia (reading assignments, PhD dissertation and U. press citations, etc.). It does not pay, so it is not really a job, but it is very satisfying. I love hearing from teachers and researchers from around the world tell me about what they are doing with my work.  The public notice of my work did generate offers to advise/train companies interested in my specialty and invitations to teach in college. However, I am more focused on creating something myself. One project is that I am currently using my years of writing experience, with what I learned in my research, to design and then start an unusual life coaching business that focuses on Socratic style self examination.  Another aspect is that my persistence in continuing philosophy research/writing combined with my non-philosophy experience in R&D, which involved designing education courses, also led to invitations to help high schools and colleges design new curriculum related to philosophy. My current research includes gaining a knowledge of how to meet this need. Quite frankly, I will probably just write it up and release it for free. Nothing travels like the speed of free on the internet. I recently rejected an unsolicited offer from a publisher because they could not guarantee I would get more readers than I currently have on my own.  The short of it is that one useful path is to remain persistent in your interest and research in philosophy even if you do not get a job related to your education. This continued persistence can give you more experience and knowledge to innovate your own opportunities related to your education. Also, the continued study of philosophy is very worthy from a personal development perspective.  For me, it took A LOT of persistence. After graduation I never stopped doing my own research. From the day I graduated wondering ""What next?"" until today was a journey of 19 years. Just the time from posting my first essay on the internet until now has been 9 years. Throughout all that time, my love of philosophy has grown deeper and my sense of participating in the study and use of philosophy has grown stronger. My living has been improved in very meaningful ways through my persistence in philosophy. Even though my particular use of my education may not meet the full standards of having a career in philosophy, my education has remained both personally and professionally very relevant. I am a philosopher and I LOVE it!"

Because of its roles as the unifying principle of all good beings and as the condition of knowledge of those good things, the Good is definitely a form. But it's unique among the forms in being the most (epistemically and metaphysically) fundamental and the ultimate reality. Without the Good, there would be nothing at all.   Therefore, say that not only being known is present in the things known as a consequence of the good, but also existence and being are in them besides as a result of it, although the good isn't being but still beyond being, exceeding it in dignity and power"" (509e).   I think the assumption underlying this move is that the cause/source/ground of something must be distinct from or beyond that thing.

The following paragraph illustrates it better, detailing how proper names are really descriptions using the example of Bismarck (in the History of Western Philosophy he uses George Washington). Only Bismarck himself had direct acquaintance with the referent of the name 'Bismarck', people who knew him and saw him associated a memory of certain sense-data with that name, light bouncing off of his body, whatever, ie. they knew him by description.

askphilosophy,3dybao,johnnyclimax,24,Mon Jul 20 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"If we take philosophy at face value, the point of philosophy is to solve philosophical problems. There are questions out there like ""What makes some of our beliefs justified"" and ""Is it ever acceptable to break a promise"" and ""Does anything non-physical exist"" and ""What makes a name refer to the object to which it refers,"" and when we do philosophy, we try to find out the answers to those questions. By this view, philosophy is certainly not ""a speculative form of artistic expression""--the point isn't to express something in ourselves, but to find out the answers to questions that we're curious about. And by this view philosophy is a ""relic of tradition"" only in that in attempting to answer these questions, we build on the work that's already been done for us by philosophers of the past--though of course we often disagree with those philosophers. And philosophy is ""different than just studying or questioning"" because while philosophy is one individual discipline (or perhaps several related disciplines), we can study and question in any discipline we want: for instance, if we're studying and questioning whether the Riemann hypothesis is true, then we're doing mathematics, but if we're studying and questioning whether moral claims are truth apt, then we're doing philosophy.   I have noticed a huge math and science community online, but very little in terms of philosophy (askphilosophy has less than 100th of the subs as askscience, for example). Is philosophy ""dying out"" or is it already essentially a historical or ""legacy"" discipline?   Philosophy is an active discipline in academia. Universities continue to employ professors of philosophy who are expected to perform novel research, and journals continue to publish articles that (at least at face value) make new contributions to our philosophical understanding. It may not be exceedingly well represented on Reddit or the greater internet, however."

As well, those solved problems that don't birth new fields are often appropriated by other fields because of their relevance. For example of the former, the rise of computer science came out of logicians working on projects in algorithms and computability. You also see natural science breaking off of ""Philosophy proper"" as people decided that the use of the Scientific Method was a good answer to ""how might we come to best know about the world?"" In terms of the latter, Gödel's incompleteness theorems come out of not pure mathematics, but out of a desire to ground mathematics in a rigid philosophical base via logical axiomatization. The proof itself, as well, is largely in the space of logic rather than pure mathematics."

So to someone who is skeptical of the value of philosophy, I think this kind of answer simply opens up skepticism about the value of philosophers.

Philosophy is about digging up and examining these assumptions, trying out new assumptions, analyzing problems that crop up, if said assumptions lead to conflict, and so on.   I don't think philosophy will ever die out, perhaps the academic departments may shrink, but people will continue to pose questions about the nature of the mind, justice, truth, knowledge, etc. These are distinctly philosophical questions. We won't ever be 'done' philosophy, since these questions are conceptual rather than 'matter of fact', so, for example, we need to define what counts as just before we can go about asking whether specific acts are just, and the definition of justice is exactly what philosophers analyze, debate, reformulate, etc."

You can use math and science to design things for use by people who don't understand any of the math or science that went into it. But philosophy has very little trading value. The value of philosophy is in actually doing philosophy, not in providing goods and services for people uninterested in doing philosophy.  But because philosophy does lack trading value, and you can't benefit much from philosophy except by doing it yourself, it is important to make a personal study of it for the benefits that studying it can bring to your life. Philosophy is about such things as figuring out how you can know anything (epistemology), figuring out what kind of world you live in (metaphysics), and figuring out how you should live your life (ethics). Philosophy will make a difference in how you think and in how you live, but this works by you doing philosophy yourself, not by someone else doing philosophy for you."

Philosophy just seems to be asking and answering questions.  Science is philosophy. As is math. Philosophy is any instance of asking and answering questions.  But then, why is it so complicated and convoluted? Why are there pages upon pages of writing dedicated to it?  Honestly, I think it's just because the answers themselves take up a lot of words. Because we live in a complicated world, the answers to questions can also be very complicated, and thus very, very long.  Most people probably never delve very deeply into it because they have other interests they find more fulfilling. I mean, everyone has curiosity, to varying extents; everyone thinks about questions, and tries to answer them. But some people just spend more time doing other things.  In the end, philosophy is about asking and answering questions, for the sake of the answers themselves. It is about seeking truth as an end, not as a means.   It's not really about art. And it's not really about tradition. Philosophy comes down to curiosity. That's basically what it is -- a bunch of people being curious about different things."

Any released in the last 60 years or is it just ancient philosophy?   In math or science, I don't have this problem because I know what I am doing, but what is the pattern of philosophy?   Unlike math or science, philosophy has no prior set definition. The role of philosophy is, itself, a topic of philosophical discussion. In the past, philosophy included what we today call the natural sciences, though that changed around the 19th century (I'd cite William Whewell's coining of ""scientist"" as the point of break).   You can be sure that the role of philosophy has changed before and after its break with science. The most recent significant change was the linguistic turn in the early 20th century which placed philosophy, at least for some, in the role of defusing linguistic and conceptual knots in other disciplines, though this period has commonly been said to end with Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity.  Unfortunately I have to get to work so I can't address the other questions but I hope to at a later time."

askphilosophy,3dybao,filosophikal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:51 2015 UTC,"Well, whether or not we are aware of it, we're all doing philosophical thinking all day. As others have pointed out, philosophy is the attempt to recognize what philosophical questions we want to answer, and then to try to figure out if there are answers to these questions, what they are, and why they are ""true."" But we all do that anyways - for example, when you use language to express an idea, you're depending on a philosophical understanding of what language is and how it works. Philosophers are just people who acknowledge that this thought process is happening and who are interested in figuring out what's going on when we do that. An analogy that might be helpful: we also are doing math all the time. When you throw a football to someone, your brain is doing complex mathematical equations to determine the arc of the throw and the strength required to throw it a certain distance. And mathematicians are the people who are interested in talking about those equations and figuring out how to express them in ways that are meaningful and useful.   Philosophy often seems pointless to non-philosophers, but it has many very practical applications in everyday life. For example, I study epistemology and psych, and I'm interested in thinking about how our understanding and use of language (a philosophical question) has influenced the development of clinical psych practices, and then thinking about how we can apply philosophical understandings of language to this practice in order to produce more effective and ethical clinical practices."

Philosophy isn't any different than any other field in the sense that it becomes a mire pretty quickly. Just that one statement raises a whole host of philosophical questions. What sort of definitive good life can we point at? How do we determine it?  There is also a huge difference between philosophy and other academic fields such as math and science. Science and Mathematics deal with constants, and the closest things to consistent and objective truths that we have. Philosophy certainly asks what is constant, and what is true. However it doesn't use these constants to solve things (Logic notwithstanding.) Philosophy seems to focus much more on relationships, to the point where I would compare it to economics or sociology before math and science.  See philosophy namely deals with what your English teacher probably told you was what all stories are about. Man vs himself. Man vs Man. Man vs the environment. Of course that is an unnecessarily antagonistic look. However that's the sort of thing philosophy deals with. The relationship man holds to himself, to other men, and to the environment in general. Where do we all fit into the grand scheme of things.  I wouldn't say philosophy is dying out. I would say that it has become very academic in modern days. We don't have the almost Evangelical philosophies of yesteryear, where Greeks would stand around Stoas and preach to the masses. Although Religion itself always consist of Evangelical philosophies. Most people don't need to question their beliefs and Philosophy just talks about living life. Jesus said not to steal is a good enough thing for most people. No need to get into long abstract discussions about when theft is appropriate, how great a moral wrong it is, and what morality even means. They just get on with living life.

Even though much of what he says may seem relatively straight-forward on the surface (as opposed to someone like Hegel) he's one of the most difficult philosophers Western Philosophy.  I'm not sure what you're reading by Russell.  He has written things aimed at a general audience, such as Problems of Philosophy, which shouldn't be too difficult to understand if read carefully.  However, he's also written highly technical academic works for professionals in the field such as the Principia Mathematica which would be extremely difficult for someone with no background in philosophy.  I'd recommend a general introduction to philosophy like Simon Blackburn's Think which is highly readable, and introduces several main ideas in philosophy.  For an overview of primary sources, I'd reccomend an anthology like Introducing Philosophy by Robert C. Solomon, which organizes works by themes and provides helpful commentary."

For instance, many of us think that helping someone commit suicide if they have an painful incurable terminal illness is okay. Many of us think it is permissible to kill someone in self-defense. Many of us think that it would be okay to unhook someone from life support if they have become a vegetable and have no hope of recovering. Etc.  So the question then is whether abortion can ever fall into the category of ""permissible killing of human life."" Pro-choice philosophers say yes, pro-life philosophers say no. But there is literally zero disagreement about where a human life starts. A human life starts at conception.  Typically the argument is about when personhood starts (see also here) or, granting that personhood starts at or near conception, whether abortion is a permissible killing of a person. Persons are not human beings, necessarily - a Martian could be a person. And human beings are not persons, necessarily - a fertilized egg isn't a person, perhaps.

askphilosophy,3e1at4,twrule,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"If you define 'human life' strictly biologically, then sure - though someone might ask why you'd arbitrarily start at conception and not go further back to your parents gametes, and their parents gametes and so on back to the first life in the universe (which leaves the question with no non-arbitrary answer). Also, are gametes and zygotes what we think of when we say 'human life is sacred'? Probably not for most. If we conceive of a human being as entirely biologically defined, then we might well say life begins at conception (though I would say you have no coherent basis for the premise that human life is 'sacred' in such a case), but, if not, the issue concerning abortion can't be settled in such a quick fashion."

Though the paper did end by pointing out that while it argued that it was immoral, it was specifically not stating anything about legality. And I think both that paper and don marquis' both argue that the idea of personhood is in a sense a red herring, since it doesn't automatically follow that one's life doesn't count for anything til one has it, due to the fact that one's life is a projection of future possibility, so barely touching a certain stage of it versus not having yet done so changes little about the remainder. (There's even following arguments that based on the definition of personhood one can argue that it is lost temporarily during dreamless sleep or especially a comatose state). On the other hand, some deontology based arguments try to allow that it can be permissible even with personhood. So beyond that one issue there are other issues on both sides."

In which case, you would be basing the view in that attribute rather than species.  After all, we would be having a similar discussion if we were birds instead of apes.   Let's take a non-utilitarian perspective.   Generally, you don't need a complete ethical system to solve a single issue. The principle ""treat alike cases alike"" is usually enough. Abortion can be compared to three cases:   Murder. Killing in self-defense. Having your appendix removed.    Why does/doesn't life start at conception?   Because it starts at abiogenesis.

askphilosophy,3e0k60,Weenercopter,4,Tue Jul 21 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that 'primitive survival instinct' is something that genuinely motivates human beings, but setting that issue aside...   Without such a reason to live, would everyone just commit suicide?   Probably not. Firstly because we don't necessarily have entirely rational motivation for continuing to live (how many people have you asked that had a well thought-out reason, if any at all?), and second you'd need either an additional argument for why you should cease to live, or you'd need to be so paralyzed by the lack of meaning that you simply let yourself perish, which is a relatively rare happening even among the masses who don't believe they have any particular reason to live.   How, though, does one identify such a reason?   This is a more interesting question. Firstly, you might not expect to find the 'reason' in the form of an easily articulated assertion like ""I continue to live because X"". However, there are various ideas on what makes life worth living and what could possibly make a human life meaningful. Some have said that a human being needs a sense of direction - some horizon that orients all their decisions and activities, making them non-arbitrary, and which itself represents a noble ideal for the form of human existence/destiny. As far as how to identify this, there have been different suggested methods, which don't necessarily conflict with one another: Nietzsche asked us to think of all the things which we have most esteemed (and/or most esteem) in our life and follow the thread which connects them (a certain spirit or attitude about life, perhaps) - in other words, when you reach a state of living in a way that most perfectly expresses your most profound passions and convictions, you will overcome the need to ask the question of meaning. Martin Buber would say that you can gauge the meaningfulness of your way of life based on the depth, intimacy, and overall adequacy of your interpersonal relationships. But of course, if worthy 'reasons' to live are up to us to evaluate, then so are worthy methods for identifying worthy reasons."
askphilosophy,3e0k60,twrule,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Certainly many people feel the need for a reason to live, otherwise questions of existential meaning wouldn't be so common. Whether everyone needs one seems impossible to answer, because we can't know what's in anyone elses mind. Obviously any reason to live must be subjective, at least in the sense of being relative to a subject (there's no objective life, only subjects have lives which may have meanings), but this does not imply that all meanings are equal."

But that is in itself problematic and a characteristic of philosophy. Science stems historically from philosophy, under philosophical premises, so that could be ""right"" to some extent, I don't see how it's useful though. A biologist is not a philosopher (although he can be both in some contexts, I would argue that Gould did a bunch of philosophy, for example)  I mean, surely you wouldn't say that american football and baseball are the same because they are sports. In the same line, I wouldn't say science and philosophy are the same because they are bodies of knowledge.  I don't want to get into the ""what's philosophy"" debate here because it quite the swampy one. Let's just say that philosophy can be broadly understood as ""unbound, yet strict and somewhat methodic inquiry, without unity of method"" while science could be broadly undestood as ""bound, methodic and experiemntal inquity, with unity of method"".

Philosophy is concerned with all aspects of human existence and understanding, not just the socio-political, and (as a whole) it need not limit itself to any particular method. I would not call critical theory a sub-sect of philosophy either, since critical theorists (again, from my minimal experience with them) don't seem particularly interested in questioning the philosophical foundations of the assumptions they begin with after a point - they generally remain within what their theories/methods assume and focus on the critical application of those theories/methods, perhaps analogously to how scientists accept the assumptions underlying the scientific method in order to carry out their work."

This suggests not that philosophers accept some alternative view of time, but they just don't know.  As far as alternative views of time, here are some thoughts.  First, A-theory is somewhat ambiguous. It could just be the view that time passes. However, McTaggart seems to construe it as involving tense facts or tense properties, such that there is a property of being present that some events have and then lose. But someone might think time passes without thinking there is any property of being present. Prior, for instance, would say, with respect to my typing, that the passage of time consists in the fact that I am now typing and it will be the case that I am no longer typing. And that's it.  Second, General relativity is consistent with there being closed time-like curves, under which the before-after distinction breaks down, which would seem to threaten both A-theory and B-theory.  Third, Oaklander has written about the ""Russellian"" theory of time, which as I recall is supposed to be an alternative to either the A or B theory. Unfortunately I can't recall the details a the moment, though I remember finding it unclear when I read it."

A theory (putting aside the ambiguity I mentioned previously) is just the view that time passes, which involves the notion that past, present, and future are objective features of reality. According to the growing block theorist, past and present things exist but not future things. But the present is not a fixed point: it's moving. That's why the block is growing: new times are being added. So on growing block theory, time is passing and past and present, at least, are objective features of reality."

askphilosophy,3dxgjz,MaceWumpus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:14 2015 UTC,This is a summary of BonJour's moderate rationalism.  I think the main tenets are  i) synthetic a priori (which the moderate empircist denies)  ii) fallible a priori (which the classical rationalist denies)
askphilosophy,3dxgjz,kabrutos,4,Mon Jul 20 13:30:15 2015 UTC,"Empiricism, at least the moderate kind claims   I'm deeply suspicious of claims regarding ""moderate"" empiricism--the ones that I've encountered who take this strategy tend to make the ""moderate"" picture out to be much more extreme than than it actually is--but that's somewhat beside the point.  Consider, for example, an alternative set of theses, that we might take as one interpretation of the ones you offered:   No statement knowable a priori expands on our (in principle) knowledge about the world (i.e., the conclusion is always contained in the premises). All statements that expand on our (in principle) knowledge about the world are a posteriori.    Now, I actually don't think that the ""in principle expansion"" claim here can be made to work. But the empiricist could (rightfully) claim that both of these theses are at least in principle justifiable by induction, in which case they can both be justified empirically.  As indicated, this picture is overly simplistic--most discussions of ""empiricism"" and ""rationalism"" are--and quite possibly just false, but there's no reason to think that it's self-defeating."
askphilosophy,3dxgjz,MaceWumpus,4,Mon Jul 20 12:19:09 2015 UTC,"This is an argument BonJour and Bealer have made, and I don't know of any really great reply to it, other than denying that empiricism is committed to exactly those claims, as /u/MaceWumpus suggests. You can read BonJour and Devitt's exchange in Steup and Sosa (eds.), Contemporary Debates in Epistemology. If I remember correctly, Devitt's reply is basically 'Yeah, but who really knows anything?' (That's a bit uncharitable, but it's not too far from the truth.)    I'll actually consider /u/MaceWumpus's suggestion here since it's a useful one:     Consider [...] 1. No statement knowable a priori expands on our (in principle) knowledge about the world (i.e., the conclusion is always contained in the premises) [although I don't think this claim can be made to work]. 2. All statements that expand on our (in principle) knowledge about the world are a posteriori. [The] empiricist could (rightfully) claim that both of these theses are at least in principle justifiable by induction, in which case they can both be justified empirically.     Here's how BonJour and Bealer would reply.      First, normally, statements don't have premises or conclusions. So maybe this just means that all known statements are either tautologies or known empirically.    Second, (1) and (2) are clearly synthetic, or at least clearly they're not just tautologies.    Third, notably, if we define 'knowledge' in a normative way, then there's no hope for (1) or (2) to be known empirically, since no one has any idea how to see justification in a cloud chamber. In contrast, if we define it descriptively, then no one has any reason for anyone to believe in empiricism. The most they could have is hypothetical, instrumental reason, but no one has ever figured out how to justify even 'if someone wants true beliefs, then they should believe such-and-such' without first showing that such-and-such is epistemically justified.    Fourth, relatedly, it's not clear how the empiricist can explain how tautologies are knowledge. There's the problem (again) that knowledge is normative, plus simply the basic problem that 'tautologies are known' appears to be non-tautologous, but it's really not clear how to justify it empirically.    Fifth, no one knows how to justify induction given empiricism. 'Science uses induction and science is successful' just pushes the problem back, and of course science has really only been successful so far. The best defenses of induction require (Stove) knowing that mathematics is sound and (Armstrong) knowledge of objective relations between properties. Someone might try to use abduction here, but now we can just ask how the empiricist justifies abduction. 'Induction is justified,' in any case, is just as vulnerable to these criticisms as 'empiricism is justified' is. So in this sense, I think, the proposal in question will still be self-defeating.     Of course, BonJour and Bealer will also point to allegedly obvious cases of non-tautologies that can't obviously be justified empirically. For example, 'Deduction confers justification' can be added to the list already containing 'induction confers justification' and 'abduction confers justification' and 'science confers justification.' And then there's 'tautologies are justified.' And of course claims about red and green, mathematical claims, and claims about modality."

But after thinking further about the implications of accepting this 2/3 probability of heads given that it's Monday, I decided the probaiblity didn't make sense. Beauty ought to hold that the probability that the coin came up heads given that she is being awoken on a Monday is 1/2, not 2/3--I believe.   So your position changed because when you perform a bayesian update upon being told nw information it disagrees with your 'gut feeling' about how she should weight them? It seems like you've fallen into a similar trap to the monty hall problem. The reason for the probability becoming 2/3 that it is a heads upond learning that it's Monday is because for a head flip there is no other option than Monday! If the coin flip had been Tails it is only a 50/50 chance of whether it could have been Monday or Tuesday, so upon finding it is monday it definitely is more likely to have been heads than tails. 2/3 may seem high, but the math checks out.  Edit: I didn't realize you were the same guy, but you've also basically ignored the top 1,2,3,4,5, comments in the thread, all of the saying the exact same correct thing. The problem is ambiguious and asks two very different questions.

Not quite. If Beauty is told on Sunday that she is going to be told on Monday when she wakes up that it is Monday, then this is effectively the same of not even putting Beauty to sleep Sunday night. Thus, we can say the experiment begins Monday morning with the experimenter telling Beauty that it is Monday and then saying, ""Okay, close your eyes for a second. I'm going to toss the fair coin.... Okay, I've tossed it. What do you believe is the probability that it came up heads?"" The correct answer is clearly 1/2, not 2/3. The fact that Beauty knows that if it lands on tails the experimenter is going to ask Beauty a second time doesn't change this.  In other words, I accept Elga's premise E1 and reject Lewis' premise L1 (again, from this paper)."

I understand the logic behind the halfer perspective, but I've always been a thirder. For me, the 1/3 solution makes the most sense because we have been asked to answer the question as Beauty, not as the person flipping the coin. We're not being asked about the probability of the coin being flipped in general, we're asked about the probability as it exists within our own temporal experience. So we're not asking ""what's the probability that the coin landed heads,"" we're asking ""what's the probability that the coin landed heads in my experience.   I also feel validated in this belief given that when you run the experiment many times, the answer does turn out to be heads 1/3 of the time. It reminds me a lot of the Monty Hall problem, in that the 1/2 answer seems logical until you remember that you're supposed to be coming at it from a perspective of temporal experience."
askphilosophy,3dzsxh,kurtgustavwilckens,4,Mon Jul 20 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"Now here's my current ""problem"" or train of thought: it seems, although I didn't see him stating it categorically, that other things that are not man can also have the ""way of being of Dasein"". The things he seems to point at, however, are either man-made or man-related: language, poetry, institutions, nations, etc., seem to share in this way of being that is Dasein.   This way of thinking seems to be a quirk of the interpretations of Heidegger by thinkers like Dreyfus and his colleague Haugeland; I don't recall anything I read in Heidegger that pressed me toward  this conclusion, personally. To me, Dasein is clearly only 'human existence' (or, the type of being that humans happen to uniquely have, to be precise) - and the fact that we can manipulate our creations doesn't mean they have been imparted with the 'essence of existence' or a 'concern with [their own] Being'.   Now, this is clear enough for man-made stuff, but it seems to me that you could apply the same form of analysis for life in general. Heidegger states, I believe in Methaphysical Problems that a rock has no world, a dog is poor in world, and that a man has world. Now, it would seem to me that instead of talking about the individual dog being ""world-poor"", you could talk about life in general, as a unified phenomena, being ""world-rich"" in a similar sense in which we are ""world-rich"", although not identical.   I don't see how you could do this using Heidegger's methods, and I don't see why he would be interested in outlining one sense of 'life' that applies to all biological organisms, when he clearly seems to believe that human beings and non-human animals are fundamentally distinct in essence. As Gadamer, following Heidegger, laid it out: animals have their environments (umwelt), humans have access to a world (welt). Looking at 'life in general', would seem to efface this distinction.   It is patent for me that any form of life has a ""concern with being"" that is not present in rocks. Reality presents concerns for living things, and for life in general.   Keep in mind that some sense of 'having dealings with beings' is importantly different from having concern for one's own Being and Being in general, which only Dasein (humans) have. Animals don't have a need to try to understand what they are - they don't get anxious about their finitude and the groundlessness of their values - they are simply one with their environments. As a result, they can't/don't really concern themselves with even other entities in the ways we do.   It seems obvious that, as with Dasein, life is directed ""forward"" in temporality in a certain sense that a rock or a sun is not. Thus, life would constitute a ""temporality"" that stems from it's concern with being, similarly as with Dasein in Heidegger, although radically different because of the differences in life's ontoligcal structure.   Heidegger goes to pains to point out that a 'temporality' characterized by practical navigation of an environment is not authentically-understood temporality, and animals probably don't have the existential structures that would even allow them to understand their environment otherwise than they do, so animals being motivated to behave certain ways - being concerned with how best to acquire food or what have you - isn't evidence of a Dasein-like intimate projected understanding of temporality.   It would seem that all living things face reality as ""ready-to-hand"" but not as ""present-at-hand""   While we could say that animals act analogously to a human being who navigates her world with a 'ready-to-hand' understanding of it, the fact that animals are limited to an environment rather than having a world means there is a qualitative difference in the sort of 'understanding' being employed between the two. Primates can use basic tools, but they don't experience each stick as a potential piece of equipment lying there for manipulation like we would a hammer - they use it and then 'forget about' it; it remains indistinguishable from their experience, unlike a human approaching a hammer, which is always 'set at a distance' from him by virtue of his uncanny distinctness from his world.   Would this enterprise be not philosophical at all but scientific? (is this enterprise biology?)   Such a project probably wouldn't be scientific in method but it would seem to be scientific in its assumptions (with 'life' apparently being biologically defined, not phenomenologically so).  Anyway, sorry if my tone is dismissive, but this project goes against a great deal of my interpretation of Heidegger's thought (which I believe aligns with a fairly mainstream interpretation, if not the one espoused by Dreyfus and his students/peers). I actually wrote my master's thesis on a topic relevant to this: Dreyfus had a debate with another contemporary American academic philosopher, John McDowell, over the nature of the distinction between human and animal cognition/'world-perception' which you might be interested in looking up (Heidegger is mentioned, though I personally don't think either of their views works as well as Heidegger's under my reading). You may find supporters for your proposed project among Dreyfus' students though."
askphilosophy,3dzsxh,twrule,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"when he clearly seems to believe that human beings and non-human animals are fundamentally distinct in essence.    Yes, they are. However, what I would say is that human beings and non-human animals are fundamentally distinct in existence. I think here lies the key of what I'm trying to say. Let me go back to something:   I think this way of thinking is a quirk of the interpretations of Heidegger by thinkers like Dreyfus and his contemporary Haugeland - I don't recall anything I read in Heidegger that pressed me toward this conclusion, personally.    What happened here is that in my own reading of Heidegger I had the intuition that there had to be something ""in the background of Dasein"" that came from life, and as I advanced in the text I thought more and more that ""life in general"" had a way of being that shared some very fundamental characteristics with Dasein. Now, when I went to Dreyfus I took his reading of other stuff having the way of being of Dasein (stuff that is man-made) I used this interpretation to ""jump from it"" to the other side of the zero-point that is Dasein, did that make sense? However, I didn't remember myself seeing, as you said, Heidegger saying it himself, I did take his word for it. I'd like to have that argument with you, if you don't mind, regarding if other stuff has the form of Dasein or not, and why. But let's leave that hanging.  Let me go back about what I said that: ""human beings and non-human animals are fundamentally distinct in existence."" Now, Heidegger says that a rock can have an essence but Dasein has existence. But life, from the beginning of reading Heidegger, had this uncomfortable ""middle ground"" that didn't seem to fit neither the way a rock is or the way a human being is. What is a dog? Is he just ""proto-dasein""?    Keep in mind that some sense of 'having dealings with beings' is importantly different from having concern for one's own Being and Being in general, which only Dasein (humans) have.   Absolutely, but that is an existenciary (sorry if the terms are wrong here, mother tongue is spanish so be charitative :) ) of Man-Dasein's way of being, but if we agree that life has existence then it will have it's own ontological structure.  Now, this may seem weird, but I immediately thought of The Selfish Gene and could not help but think that it was a sort of ""speculative phenomenology"" of a thing that had a way of being that we could recognize as being more similar to us than a rock (driven towards something, but not exactly teleological, it has reference in the sense that the gene carries instructions to make something, and it that sense you could understand that it forms a referential whole).    and animals probably don't even seem to have the existential structures that would even allow them to understand their environment otherwise than they do, so animals being motivated to behave certain ways - being concerned with how best to acquire food or what have you - isn't evidence of a Dasein-like intimate projected understanding of temporality.   Exactly, but life as a whole, or ""the gene level"", certainly has, let's not say temporality, but it has an ""eventfulness"" in a distinct sense that a rock hasn't. It changes over time to react to it's environment, it constitutes it and it is constituted by it in a way that to me it is certainly closer to the way we relate to the world to that way in which a rock relates to the world. Genetics has a certain ""historicity"" in a sense that the universe itself does not.   I absolutely agree that these would be two absolutely different ways of existence, but they would be two ways of existence, and I think you could say that Human Existence adds one more ""loop"" to living existence to constitute Dasein? Could that make sense? We go from something that doesn't react, the rock, to something that reacts to the world, life, to something that reacts to it's own reactions to the world, taking his initial reaction from granted, Dasein. That was a bit ranty, but did that not make any sense to you?  I don't know if both being existent would qualify both as Dasein, I was working under the assumption that ""existence"" = Dasein, but maybe that's a distincition he didn't make that could be made?"
askphilosophy,3dzsxh,twrule,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:15 2015 UTC,"Let me go back about what I said that: ""human beings and non-human animals are fundamentally distinct in existence."" Now, Heidegger says that a rock can have an essence but Dasein has existence. But life, from the beginning of reading Heidegger, had this uncomfortable ""middle ground"" that didn't seem to fit neither the way a rock is or the way a human being is. What is a dog? Is he just ""proto-dasein""?   Remember that 'existence' is a technical term for Heidegger that only applies to Dasein (""Dasein's essence is existence"" as he says). ""Existence"" here means basically Dasein's ability to understand its own identity (and by consequence its world) in one particular way or another (hence a human being's existential freedom to switch between approaching the world as 'ready-to-hand', or 'present-to-hand', and so on). Even though the clean opposite example is the rock which certainly has no 'existence' and only essence in this sense, technically we could say that animals don't have 'existence' either because they lack this existential freedom of projected identity/understanding.  But yes, that leaves the question of the non-obvious case of animals. Heidegger didn't really answer this question directly, but Gadamer did a good job of applying Heidegger's environment/world distinction to the distinction between humans and animals. Again, in a nutshell, the distinction here is that an animal is 'one' with its world (the animal's identity, its perceptual experience, and the beings in its environment are all identical with one another - they are indistinguishable from one another), while a human being is primordially distinct from his world - Heidegger speaks of how Dasein is 'not-at-home' in its world, how it does not 'belong' - it exists in 'the clearing': structurally connected to its world (as 'Being-in-the-world') yet distinct from it and thus experiencing it at a distance from itself. As a result, beings in the world can show themselves as alien or peculiar to Dasein - they are far from being understood as merely objects of Dasein's 'experience'. This is part of why animals cannot shift into the mood of 'Anxiety', where this uncanniness of 'not-being-at-home' in the world comes to the fore of concern.  So, animals simply have their own sort of being (there's no need to define it as 'proto-Dasein' - they aren't potentially or partially Dasein, nor are they indistinguishable in their being from rocks), they are something entirely different, and we best respect them and ourselves by respecting that difference.   Absolutely, but that is an existenciary (sorry if the terms are wrong here, mother tongue is spanish so be charitative :) ) of Man-Dasein's way of being, but if we agree that life has existence then it will have it's own ontological structure.   The being of different types of animals no doubt have specific ontological structures - but there's no reason we should need to understand those structures as some sort of variant of Dasein. If anything, that might obscure Heidegger's project; he professed the need to understand Dasein's structure first so that Being itself (and all other sorts of beings) could then be understood - but if we expect that we should need to analyze Being from an animal consciousness we have no access to or make a leap to speculating that they are also Dasein against Heidegger's own analysis of Dasein (do we really encounter other animals as 'Being-with' in the same way we do with other human beings? I'd say not.), then it's uncertain how such a project could ever get off the ground.   Now, this may seem weird, but I immediately thought of The Selfish Gene and could not help but think that it was a sort of ""speculative phenomenology"" of a thing that had a way of being that we could recognize as being more similar to us than a rock (driven towards something, but not exactly teleological, it has reference in the sense that the gene carries instructions to make something, and it that sense you could understand that it forms a referential whole).

Genetics has a certain ""historicity"" in a sense that the universe itself does not.   You may be interested in the work of Maturana and Varela - biologists with a theory of 'autopoietic' (self-creating/self-organizing/self-referential) living systems which may bear on this idea. Also, Niklaas Luhmann, a sociologist influenced by Heidegger, took their idea of autopoeisis and expanded it from merely living systems to social and psychical, and made the whole theory more abstract and rigorous. I wouldn't call any of those thinkers phenomenologists, but their ideas are elegant and analytically useful - and your area of interested might be straying from phenomenology anyway (we can talk about animal comportment to some extent through phenomenology but things like 'genetic histories' aren't directly accessible to first-person experience, of course).   As a side note, your focus somewhat reminds me of some old writings of Goethe's I once read, where he described the 'historicity' of a plant as he imagined each past and future stage of its development being superimposed upon one another, expressing the plant's essence. In fact, I once had an assignment that asked me to take a position on whether Goethe qualified as a phenomenologist - I argued that he didn't (but perhaps he was closer to one in that he described his temporally and imaginatively-mediated encounter with a plant than a modern biologist attempting to explain the plant's changes as expressions of 'genetic instructions' would be).   I absolutely agree that these would be two absolutely different ways of existence, but they would be two ways of existence, and I think you could say that Human Existence adds one more ""loop"" to living existence to constitute Dasein? Could that make sense? We go from something that doesn't react, the rock, to something that reacts to the world, life, to something that reacts to it's own reactions to the world, taking his initial reaction from granted, Dasein. That was a bit ranty, but did that not make any sense to you?   I think I see where you're trying to go with this, but I still don't think Heidegger's analysis or terms will necessarily be terribly suitable to your project; Dasein's existence is very unique in its multifaceted articulated structure (Care, with being-toward-death, etc.), and I don't think adding or subtracting from it for other living beings will get you quite where you want to go (nor would that necessarly be a phenomenologically well-founded move, since it would throw in assumptions that may not be phenomenologically demonstrable). Heidegger's analysis, left incomplete and vague as it was, may not be particularly useful for your purposes, but as I pointed out, he has influenced a large number of thinkers, particularly systems theorists  who have since attempted to take philosophically-informed approaches to the sciences, including biology, in ways that might interest you.  Then again, I might have misunderstood your concern here, and you want to get at some phenomenon that those systems theorists wouldn't have touched on, in which case you'd have to clarify that for me."

I don't know, it just seems too philosophically interesting that the similarities, in my view, keep piling up between our human activity and life's activity that we cannot articulate a ""smooth continuity"" and a ""metaphysical story of Dasein's emergence from life"" explaining life ""backwards"" from our phenomenological experience.

With that comment, I didn't mean to imply that non-Dasein living systems don't have 'multifaceted articulated structures' - I just wanted to point out how unique Dasein is in its particular structure (which ultimately could be said of many living and ecological systems to some degree, certainly).

Well, I certainly wouldn't expect this kind of 'metaphysical story' to be produced by a phenomenologist, of course.

I can't say I'm familiar with Deacon's work, no. Based on the title of his work, though, I imagine he's making similar assumptions you seem to be making - that humanity's existence and origins ought to be explained in terms of an existing evolutionary biological picture of life's origins. Again, certainly leaving the realm of phenomenology there.  You do seem to want to speak of 'life' teleologically though.

I haven't read it, but from summary it seems that what it basically comes down to is that in a utilitarian framework, the morality of something has to come down to whether its better or worse to have happened. He argues that while the killing of animals would itself be a wrong, that framed in the context that they only exist by being raised for food, you have to look at the overall reality of their life. And he argues that via his preference utilitarianism, that the qualities of animals are such that this can be an overall positive for them making it morally acceptable even though humans have a different type of mentality which it wouldn't work for. Since R M Hare is a preference utilitarian like peter singer, and knew him well he makes sense to contrast with him.  Note that he calls this demi vegetarianism since if I'm not mistaken he points out that this would only apply if they were raised in a reasonable situation that did not contain too much suffering. Since most food in the west now comes from factory farming, this does not apply to those lives, and so he points out that you must still be against factory farming, and choose against it with your wallet to be maximally moral.

It would be hard to argue that a factory farm life is better than nothing, since while a human can have meaningful experiences even in suffering, animals have very little other than sensual input, and so very little of it being positive means they don't have much going for them. Although on the flipside, part of suffering is a psychology that understands the progress of what's happening, so them living in the moment is considered less suffering than a human would go through.

You could of course argue that their beauty standards are similar to ours by coincidence but I do not agree.  http://davidlazarphoto.com/amp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/13-David-Lazar-Brazil.jpg  http://davidlazarphoto.com/amp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/20-David-Lazar-Brazil.jpg"

Do you mean objective in terms of public ally agreed-upon truth, or in some kind of Platonic way?   It's a little awkward to talk about it using your example, but hypothetically speaking - to me, the girl with the higher score could be said to be more attractive, and that this ranking is basically as close to objectivity as we can get. I think that beauty (like pretty much every other kind of truth) is a meter of social agreement, and so if someone is said to be beautiful by many people, then they are beautiful. The issue IMO is that many people don't think of truth this way, and then you get into all kinds of debates about what makes someone beautiful or not, even though those standards change very much over time and across cultures."

You could say that art is a matter of social convention, and that an art gallery could not claim to be an art gallery to anyone who didn't like the art inside, so you would be disregarding taste.

askphilosophy,3dysk3,ragkor,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"So I have just started reading Kant's work and the perspective of the work is through the eyes of the doer. i.e Your concerned with your course of action.   You're right that Kant is very much concerned about the first-person aspects of making moral decisions, but that's not the only aspect of Kant's work.  He also makes judgments about the 'moral worth' of actions made by other people.  For instance, he gives the example of the merchant who sells goods at a fair price - not out of any sense of fairness or duty - but simply because he knows he'll be run out of business if he overcharges.  That's a case where he straightforwardly judges someone else's action as having no moral worth.   So say a man saves me from drowning just to be famous/in the news, does that mean I must not thank him for his courage is his act insignificant?   Can you thank him?  Sure.  Was he courageous?  Sure.  Is it great that he saved you?  Sure.  Should you be happy he saved you?  Of course.  But none of these things imply that there was anything particularly moral about what he did (of course, there's nothing immoral about it either - Kant wouldn't say that the man shouldn't have saved you).  To use a less dramatic example, I thank my plumber when he fixes my pipes.  I thank him because he did a good job, I appreciate his service, and it's just the polite thing to do.  But nobody thinks he deserves some kind of moral praise for fixing my pipes - he was just doing his job.  EDIT: Actually, a better comparison would be to compare the man who saves you to some kind of extreme stunt performer who does what he does just for the fame and the thrill.  We can say all sorts of good things about the stunt performer - he's courageous, talented, entertaining, pushes the boundaries of what's possible, etc.  But I don't think many people think think that performing stunts for the thrill of it deserves some kind of moral praise.    Kant's point is that, as far as morality is concerned, the man who saved you is just like the performer.  The fact that his particular 'stunt' happened to involve saving somebody's life is incidental."

Off the top of my head, the following problem areas deal with some or other concept and aspects of what you may call 'subjectivity': phenomenology/consciousness, personal identity, indexicals (the study of the word 'I'), and the problem of epistemological access to one's own mind.

In panpsychist ideas of mind especially, there's a thing called the combination problem that asks whether if individual things have properties of consciousness in them, then how is is that they can come to unite together to have a larger higher form of consciousness. The answer is that in part its simply hard to answer, since the details are abstract and beyond our scope of being able to pin down. They use language about how a relation that is in ""sympathetic communion"" that works together may inherently open a relation. With the level of communion increasing the level of bond. Some also argue that the idea of a single subject is not actually something that exists metaphysically, but is a product of psychology.

I'll call this the 'qualitative aspect' of being a member of the colony. This qualitative aspect is accessible to all members of the colony. This qualitative aspect is only accessible to members of the colony. This qualitative aspect is the same for all members of the colony.   Less fundamentally, many would also wish for a plausible physical substrate for this shared mind.

This doesn't get us too far, but they don't call it ""hard problem of consciousness"" for nothing.  Bonus edit: If a colony of ants (or brain) possesses the property required for consciousness and not the ants within it (or neurons), we might call it an 'emergent property' of the system.

""Your topic, ‘the nature of human morals’ or ‘morality and what it means’ is quite broad, but I think you can use it as the rubric through which to bring all of your chosen texts into a discussion with one another.  In working through that topic, you can then of course also discuss questions having to do with the nature of humanity—for example, are human beings free to choose, etc—and its relation to morality; and, accordingly, you can also discuss questions about divinity and God, say, whether moral strictures must have a divine, sacred foundation or whether they can be merely secular in character.  I think the works you have chosen would all help to grapple with such questions.  This includes THE PRINCE, which, for example could be pitted against Dante’s INFERNO…Dante is not simply telling a story, but envisioning all morality and order according to a sacred hierarchy and authority.  Now, think about THE PRINCE…is, for Machiavelli, the fundamental source of authority in the cosmos and human society, God?  I see THE PRINCE as actually a perfect text for the kinds of questions you’re asking, because it’s probing the relationship between morality and authority, morality and leadership: ‘is it better for the prince to be loved or feared?’; ‘should a prince keep his word?’, ‘should a prince be generous?’, etc.  ""  Its supposed to be a 10,000 word essay."

askphilosophy,3duodl,wellthisisoutrageous,27,Sun Jul 19 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"This is a huge can of worms from a Marxist perspective. In fact, in my opinion it's the most difficult question in social philosophy as it has to do with the level of free will we have in economic systems like capitalism that maximize profit instead of utility or other moral values.  It's probable that the working class in capitalist societies has different levels of free will when it comes to lifestylism and ethical consumption. Almost everyone from the Marxist camp agrees that it is unlikely we will destroy sweatshops in the Third World by trying to convince everyone in the West to only shop at stores that sell commodities produced in the First World. The overwhelming and pervasive existence of Third World commodities in First World markets like clothing, food, and other everyday items makes it virtually impossible to topple the system by abstaining from these commodities.  On the other hand, some things can be easier, like veganism. Veganism has been increasingly popular and can affect the revenue of the bourgeoisie that run exploitive factory farms. However, even veganism can be a challenge for the poorer ends of the working class in developed nations like the US. If you live in a black ghetto and work for McDonalds, the seemingly minor price between fast food and vegan food is actually great enough to persuade you away from this kind of lifestylism. This includes not only buying the food but spending the additional time and money to cook it. Interestingly, this is also the sociological reason why being obese is more of an indicator of poverty rather than wealth in nations like the US.

askphilosophy,3duodl,bch8,4,Mon Jul 20 03:55:03 2015 UTC,I suppose this depends on you understanding Marx's labour theory of value. This always entails exploitation at some level when a product is made. The worker never receives the full value of the product in return as the capitalist takes a profit which they never produced- this also eventually leads to crises of overproduction and is why we have the terrible boom/bust cycle (but that's a bit more complex to explain and has been best done by some actual books rather than reddit). Then there is the environmental destruction caused by the anarchy of production and distribution and also the massive amount of waste produced by the entire production system. The more obvious cases of unavoidable unethical consumption are things like sweatshop labour produced goods.

I'm not particularly well-versed in ethical philosophy, but do you think this could stem from Marxism's lack of a normative ethical character? When I was considering the original question and evaluating my own motives, I figured I approached veganism from a deontological perspective - an animal has moral worth, so it's not right to treat it as a means - rather than as some sort of consumer boycott; this would distinguish it, although in very rough lines, from the more utilitarian-oriented idea of ethical consumption. I'm sure this can easily be rebutted by anyone with a basic background in applied ethics, but it did make me wonder how the lack of a common ethical framework can difficult the examination of moral issues."

Is this position compatible with a defense of ethical veganism, as in, is there really any feasible difference between the two concepts? Could an activist for animal rights eat meat, arguing that the ethical onus shouldn't be on the consumer?   While you're right that many philosophers criticize ethical consumerism, this does not imply that one may ethically consume any product.

This is not the case with veganism.  While the human relations involved may be better, the relationship between people and non-human animals in a communist slaughterhouse is no different.  So you cannot entirely blame the unethical nature of meat consumption on capitalism.  It is an inherent result of your consumption of meat, and therefore more directly ""your fault"".  It is possible to overthrow capitalism without ceasing your use of shirts, vegetables, phones, etc.  It is not possible to end animal exploitation with ceasing the consumption of animal products.

This is a question that can be fruitfully discussed among people from multiple ideological persuasions, if it is phrased a bit more neutrally.  Something more like, ""Is a consumer truly capable of making autonomous decisions that align with their moral beliefs, while participating in the system of modern globalist capitalism?""  Whatever your particular set of moral beliefs are - conservative, libertarian, anarchist, Marxist - it is still a very open question whether the current capitalist system truly allows one to consume in a way that aligns with one's moral beliefs.  In most cases, choosing to simply purchase or not purchase this product or that gives rise to additional moral issues, leading to an often endless chain of trade-offs. Chances are when purchasing any particular product from any sort of outlet or chain will result in some kind of moral or ethical compromise.  It becomes rather difficult to justify participating in consumerist systems at all without falling back on some kind of utilitarian justification.

We see establishments like McDonalds now begin to offer Vegetarian burgers, Quorn products are becoming more widely available, Soy Milk is easily available, Vegan custard...Would these products have existed if not for the ethical consumer? All it takes to stop factory-farming animals is for people to take a stance and say they do not want it, to boycott it.   Besides that, if you wish to be vegan for your own moral stance on the worth of animals, then it isn't clear why you should have to be swayed by the possibility of the concept of it in a capitalist system. For you are the one who acts morally by not doing it, should you act opposite to your standards because you aren't immediately making a huge difference to the world?   On the topic of sweatshops the effect is much more indirect, a t-shirt and a pair of shoes do not immediately represent the sweatshop. But it is reasonably clear that for the rack of lamb in front of you that a young sheep, well before its time, has been killed so that you may consume it.   As for those who say that poverty causes our weight I say nonsense.  We lack the education for healthy eating but the campaigns are there, we're all beginning to learn. Fast food is not a cheaper alternative to a proper meal and several documentaries have been broadcasted recently about the unhealthy lifestyle that sugar and a lack of exercise brings.

Even that most basic connection of Him holding you in existence is repulsive to the damned. The separation is on the part of the person, not on God. He loves you, and that is unbearable.   Edit: I think it's important to consider the full weight of what it means to be deprived of joy and peace. It's not as if you are just kind of melancholic, or bored. Existence itself is painful. You are perpetually in a state of hatred and delusion. All you know is inner turmoil. Dante was, in general terms, pretty faithful to Catholic Theology on this point."
askphilosophy,3dvrzf,Ronald0912,2,Mon Jul 20 08:34:00 2015 UTC,"Catholic Theology, as distinct from that of Luther, holds that Christ descended into the equivalent of Purgatory, ""The bosom of Abraham"", ""Sheol"", or it has been even called the ""hell of the just.""   I was under the impression that the Patriarchs were in Limbo, which was distinct from Purgatory. But either way, if Christ going to hell would be limited to limbo, that would make some sense, since the people sent there have not turned their back on God. I guess the question then is why is Limbo part of hell and not just some third (fourth?) place distinct from heaven, hell, and purgatory?  What would Lutheranism say on this? And I also heard something about the Pope ""abolishing"" limbo a while back, but I understand this to be rejecting the limbo of children, not the limbo of the Fathers.   Hell is separation from God in the sense that you are deprived of joy and peace, and are afflicted by the just punishments for your sins. Not only this, but you hate God. Even that most basic connection of Him holding you in existence is repulsive to the damned.   So it's a separation more in the sense that the damned turn their back on God, rather then something like ""losing all connection to God"", and losing joy and peace is a necessary consequence of this?  And as for Dante, since you bring him up, what did he base the nine circles of hell on? It seems rather surprising that he would use the deadly sins for those in Purgatory guilty of venial sins. Does he draw these nine circles from anywhere in Thomistic thought? If so I haven't seen it.  My basic understanding of his reasoning so far is this. Limbo is for people guilty of no special sin, so they're not really tortured beyond the knowledge that they'll never enter heaven. Lust, Glutton, Greed, and Anger are corruptions of desire, which are more passive sins. The city of Dis there are the especially evil acts of Heresy, Violence, Fraud, and Treachery, which respectively show rejections of church, society (with fraud being worse than violence since it shows a greater corruption of reason while violence is common to animals), and finally total depravity. How he set this up makes sense to me, but I can't seem to find anything he would draw this from. Was this purely a creation of Dante's?"
askphilosophy,3dvrzf,Ronald0912,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:50:55 2015 UTC,"You're right, it is limbo, that was a typo.   why is Limbo part of hell and not just some third (fourth?) place distinct from heaven, hell, and purgatory?   It was distinct, but it disappeared after the Paschal mystery since it was no longer needed. Part of what we are dealing with here is the evolution of theological language. Pre-Incarnation, the afterlife was understood in more generic terms, they knew there was something more and that there was some kind of rest/reward for the just. Christ's own words (fiery Ghenna, etc) along with the John's Apocalypse, are the foundations for the specific Christian doctrine. So, when the Early Church, which was a combination of Greeks and Jews, began communicating the Gospel, their own pre-Christian concepts were all they had to work with until the major theologians came along. The Greek Hades seemed to resemble the fiery Ghenna Christ spoke of, so that was hell. So, though the Jewish bosom of Abraham wasn't like Hades, neither was it like heaven. Nevertheless, heaven is so entirely unlike an imperfect existence that the limbo of the fathers would be more like hell than heaven. Thus, hell was a catch-all term for not-heaven. Some early Christians even saw this life as hell when compared to heaven.   Luther was opposed to the idea that Christ only went to the limbo of the fathers because he didn't think it existed at all. Without explicit faith in the Triune God, man went to eternal damnation. I don't recall exactly how he explains Christ's descent, however. I suspect it was to further punish the damned, but I don't remember.   Limbo has never been officially adopted as dogma nor officially rejected. It has always been a product of theologizing (dead babies have original sin, but not personal sin, so it would seem unjust for them to be punished eternally or enter heaven with the stain of sin: ergo, limbo). Recently, Pope Benedict XVI said it was more likely the babies go to heaven anyway. However, this does not amount to an official proclamation, since many major theologians (and some popes, I think) have said the contrary.   So it's a separation more in the sense that the damned turn their back on God, rather then something like ""losing all connection to God"", and losing joy and peace is a necessary consequence of this?   Right, it is hating the very God which is willing you to exist out if love.    Limbo is for people guilty of no special sin   This is true of those who existed pre-Incarnation and were virtuous, like Virgil for example. Post-Resurrection, there is no need for limbo, except in the case of infants. Had Virgil had faith in Christ (along with grace, supernatural virtue, etc) in addition to his natural virtue, he would be amongst he blessed. However, Dante is making a distinction the Church normally doesn't make: Virgil and the like were not liberated at Christ's descent, unlike the patriarchs. The Church normally teaches that all of the just, pagan or jewish, were liberated.  I am a bit out of my depth when it comes to Dante, admittedly. I do know he was an avid admirer of Aquinas and was his quasi-contemporary. I think that would come out more in his other writings, but the Divine Comedy is a superb reflection of what medieval theologians, drawing from Aristotle and Plato, considered to be just. The punishment ought to fit the crime, and they took that pretty literally. Also, you hinted at another distinction: the soul is superior to the body, the reason is superior to emotion. Hence sins of the body are not as bad as sins against reason. This is straight out of Thomas. Morever, Catholics love ranks and hierarchy. There is a long standing tradition in the Church that heaven does have certain levels. The medieval would say it is reasonable that both hell and purgatory would too, if that is true."

askphilosophy,3dwco4,askphil,4,Mon Jul 20 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think so, but it depends what kind of anti-realist view you have in mind. This is no problem for non-cognitivists, who think that moral judgments play an extremely important expressive role. Nor is it a problem for any other anti-realist who has a good story about why we should continue to make moral judgments, either indefinitely or at least until other people stop making moral judgments. It is possible for anti-realists to get themselves in trouble here, but (in my limited knowledge) I don't know of many people whose views will actually forbid them from making moral judgments in some sense or another."
askphilosophy,3dwco4,oneguy2008,3,Mon Jul 20 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"Not directly, although there is a style of argument against some forms of anti-realism that preys upon first-order consequences of some metaethical views. The most recent version of this argument has come from Enoch and runs roughly like this:   Most of us agree that it's morally correct to solve disagreements over preferences with an impartial solution. So if Susie wants to play with the red ball and Mark wants to play with the red ball, a morally correct solution would involve some sort of compromise. According to some anti-realists moral disagreements just are disagreements about preferences. But most of us agree that it would be morally wrong (or at the very least not morally right) to seek a compromise solution in cases of moral disagreement. So if the arsonist wants to burn down a city block and I'm in a position to stop him it's not correct for me to say ""well OK, you can burn down half the city block."" Thus some forms of moral anti-realism (e.g. subjectivism and its varieties) contradict everyday moral judgments that the anti-reallist would otherwise endorse.   I've summarized the argument in more detail here, or you can just pick up Enoch's book Taking Morality Seriously."

There isn't any obvious reason why the subjectivist shouldn't have the same general preferences as a realist (she isn't going to want anyone to burn down the city). She also  acts in accordance with her preferences, so if she is in the position to stop someone burning down the block, then she would. Wouldn't she?"

Wouldn't she?   Exactly. The argument strikes its blow when she then turns around and says ""Susie, share the red ball!"" Thus the subjectivist's position becomes awkward (at best) on two levels. First it produces contradictions in first-order moral practice that wouldn't be there with any other metaethical position. Second, it puts the subjectivist in the awkward position of telling others that their moral judgments are wrong. Once again with any other metaetical position this would be fine, but since the subjectivist holds that what's right and wrong is up to each individual (or culture or whatever), it seems inconsistent for her to then turn around and tell the rest of us, who are stopping arsonists and ensuring fair play time with the ball without batting and eye, that we have some incorrect moral judgments."

If this is right then the subjectivist is not telling people they are wrong (either in the moral sense of the word, or even that they are incorrect) but rather expressing her personal preference.  So, she isn't telling the the arsonist that he's wrong as such - She's saying that she doesn't like arson, and in this case has the power to do something about it.  Where is the contradiction?

askphilosophy,3dvl1y,EvilManichean,8,Sun Jul 19 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"This is going to be an unsatisfactory answer, but continental philosophy doesn't really work that way. There's not a big problem and a flurry of papers trying to resolve it or take a side. There's all of the major problems that philosophy has dealt with, all of the issues brought up by previous continentals, and the relationship between the two, especially through a historical point of view.   One place I'd definitely look is into newer stuff about subjectivity. On the one hand, Badiou (and to a much lesser extent, Zizek and some other folks) introduced a new theory of truth that has a completely different concept of subjectivity, where subjects only ""really"" exist in relation to truth-events or acts. Followers (Hallward is a great one if you're looking for intro material) think that the subject is really important for this reason. On the other hand, object oriented ontology folks or speculative realists (I can't tell if there's supposed to be a difference between the two) criticize the idea of a correlation between subjective representation and actual objects, but also think that there's a way around this correlationism and a non-metaphysical view of the world. I don't like them very much and don't have good things to say, but they're out there. They're definitely on the side of de-emphasizing the subject.  These two groups cross-over quite a bit, and those particular positions aren't mutually exclusive. Speculative realism was partially borne out of work done by one of Badiou's students; the main difference between the two ways of looking at philosophy seems to be the place of subjectivity. However, it does push on the last hold that continentals had over subjectivity, and is getting pushback from the more phenomenologically oriented folks.  I can try to think of others, but that's the best one that I can think of that isn't mainly political (Badiou trashing Nancy over his letter during the Arab Spring is a good example of this) or just hot-button fodder (Heidegger's a racist!? I'm so surprised!). There's definitely other stuff to talk about out there. For instance, more analytically oriented folks would probably like the combination of early phenomenology, like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, with philosophy of mind, which is something that's currently being worked on by a few people. It's also important to note that some of the work done by continental philosophers is showing how, for instance, Fanon's ideas about colonization and race are playing out in the US today. Sure, it's not a new problem, but it's very interesting and it shows how far these ideas have gone in the ""real world"".  TL;DR: You're not going to find the same kind of problems that you see in analytic philosophy, so stop looking. They treat problems in entirely different ways, even when responding to the exact same problem (compare Derrida on the death penalty to any analytic author if you'd like an example). But, there's some shit going on, and some of it is cool. Some people might be waiting for the next big thing to hit, but people are mostly just doing footwork to show that a continental philosopher or view from continental philosophy can be coherently and productively applied, which isn't that different from analytic, in the end."

The only thing I'd add to that is that where the SR stuff represents a kind of affinity with Badiou and his emphases (even if there is divergence over various issues)--so, in other words an affinity with Hegel--there's also a broadly 'post-Deleuzian'--so, affinity with Spinoza--side to those conversations. This pops up especially among François Laruelle and his readers. Some of the anglophone work is being done by people like Alexander Galloway, Rocco Gangle, Joshua Ramey, Anthony Paul Smith, and Daniel Barber.  The 'French' influenced side of continental phil is more my area, so I feel less able to comment on specifics in other areas, but in more German-influenced stuff, variants of phenomenology seem to still be at the forefront, and for the last several years there's been a lot of work on phenomenology of mind. In other words, work that tries to create a bridge between analytic philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and phenomenology. I haven't read much of that stuff but if it sounds interesting, I think Dan Zahavi's work is right in the middle of all of that."

Lately it seems like more people want to deal with various aspects of identity than how we ought to be living directly, and there are still plenty of political and scientistic ideas generating noise to hamper genuinely philosophical discussion (the new talked-about 'philosophical' movements concern themselves more with things like countering climate change and ending capitalism than understanding the nature of an authentic human existence). There's a reason so many keep coming back to pour over the thought of people like Nietzsche, Heidegger and - among the more recently deceased - perhaps Levinas and Derrida; they were the last ones to concern themselves with the perennial problems.

You just think that you know the answers better than philosophers do. Let's go through the areas you listed:  Metaphysics  The view that everything is physical is certainly one metaphysical view about what exists. But it's a distinctively philosophical claim, and there are good arguments for alternatives. For example, the objects of mathematics -- numbers, sets, functions etc. -- are apparently not physical; we can't look at them with a microscope, or fire them through a particle accelerator and so on. The physicalist needs to account for mathematics somehow -- not to say that it can't be done, but physics isn't going to help you. There's philosophy to do here.  Here's the SEP article on metaphysics if you're interested in what some of the issues are.  Epistemology  To be honest, I'm not really sure what your point is here. Might I suggest you have a look through the SEP article on epistemology to get an idea of what it is that epistemologists actually do.  Logic  You're right that mathematicians are also pretty good at doing logic. But there are definitely parts of logic (i.e. philosophical logic) which is clearly in the domain of philosophy.  Aesthetics  Aesthetics isn't the same thing as art. It is (or includes) the philosophy of art, but that isn't art itself. Here's the IEP article on aesthetics if you're interested in what the issues discussed by philosophers (but not artists) are.

Out of curiosity, what's wrong with the theory I listed above in regards to numbers?   This is probably best for another post, but the problem for the physicalist is that mathematics appears to contain singular terms---or names---which purport to refer to infinitely many objects. For example, numerals like 'two', '43', 'π' and so on, and apparent definite descriptions like 'the 2-sphere', 'the group of symmetries of a square' and so on. It looks like whatever these refer to are not physical objects like tables, chairs, electrons and so on are.  So the physicalist has a number of options, all of which have problems (it's not clear to me which of these your suggestion fits in to):   Deny that these terms are in fact singular terms, by paraphrasing mathematics. This is a substantive technical task, for which there has been little success (see A subject with no object by Burgess and Rosen for examples). Accept that these are singular terms, but that they fail to refer (like 'Pegasus' and 'the king of France'). This has the unfortunate side-effect that most things we take to be mathematical truths become false. (This is known as mathematical fictionalism, or sometimes error theory). Accept that these are singular terms, and that they refer, but that they refer to physical things. In this case, you'd need to tell us what physical things they refer to, especially considering there appear to be infinitely many mathematical objects, and it's a big ask to claim that there are infinitely many physical objects. If you say that the physical objects in question are mental objects (perhaps identified with physical things like brain-states)---which is perhaps the most natural choice---there are questions about how to maintain the objectivity of mathematics and so on.   As you can see, all of these involve substantial philosophical work.   In regards to Philosophy of Science, I was reading this[2] article on physics and philosophy and the point was made that (1) there has been no substantial work being done in the field of philosophy of science while natural science has made leaps and bounds of progress.

There's certainly overlap between these fields, and a lot of interdisciplinary work being done in them. But the questions being asked are different.

askphilosophy,3dyfw0,ohtarelenion,5,Tue Jul 21 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"It seems fairly reasonable to say that all that is is physical, either composed of matter or energy.   You would have to give an argument for this, because this is a metaphysical position called physicalism. There are some problems with it. To justify physicalism, you have to engage in metaphysics.   Aesthetics: This is already its own field: art.   Art is not the only subject matter of aesthetics. For example, natural objects, such as trees, or animals, or human beings can also have aesthetic properties (beauty, ugliness). So trying to figure out what beauty consists in is not just up to the artists. Also, trying to figure out what the purpose of art ought to be is a philosophical question and when artists engage with it, they are to that extent philosophers.   This brings me to a general observation. You say:   But ought also seems to be arbitrary and an invention of philosophy.   This is contentious as well, and requires argument and justification. Many people, including many philosophers, think that there are normative facts, and that it is the purpose of philosophy to discover these. But even if there are no such facts, the debate over their existence is itself philosophical."

Many people, including many philosophers, think that there are normative facts, and that it is the purpose of philosophy to discover these.   I'm a moral realist as well.

Given your background, I think the best course of action is for you to pick one of the areas that you mentioned and I'll recommend 2-3 readings that are accessible without a paywall, and stick around to discuss them afterwards to see if you're convinced that philosophy has something to contribute.  Among the areas that you mentioned, I'm qualified to recommend in epistemology, logic, and possibly metaphysics. If you want to start with another area I""ll track down someone else. Up for the task?"
askphilosophy,3dyfw0,twrule,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty convinced of logic at this point. For metaphysics I would love to read up on what people consider things like logic, math and numbers (are they physical, or something else?) and the reliability of empiricism would be an interesting read for epistemology."
askphilosophy,3dyfw0,Momentumle,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Although physicists sometimes make metaphysical claims on the basis of physics, these claims are frequently influenced by external philosophical commitments. For example, the acausal interpretation of quantum mechanics was originally put forward by physicists who were influenced by logical positivism. Again, many chemists were skeptical of the existence of atoms for (arguably) much longer than they should have been due to the influence of logical positivism. So, if we hand metaphysics off to the physicists, it's possible that we will end up adopting ideas devised by philosophers anyway but lose the ability to criticize these ideas philosophically."
askphilosophy,3dyfw0,Momentumle,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"It seems as if the metaphysics that goes into things like physics and chemistry are actually just the early stages of science where the scientists form hypothesis.    So, if we hand metaphysics off to the physicists, it's possible that we will end up adopting ideas devised by philosophers anyway but lose the ability to criticize these ideas philosophically.   That's how science works though. You don't deal with hypothesis and then debate those different hypothesis with nothing but reason as support. They seek out empirical evidence which would then be called science. So it seems that metaphysics is only important in so far as it helps to create a hypothesis. But that's more of a scientific facet than a philosophical one at this point in time."

askphilosophy,3dwyee,ccbeef,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:38 2015 UTC,I asked what Christians thought of this issue one r/theology. St. Thomas Aquinas had the idea there is a third option. God is good. As in god=goodness. Meaning god is the personification of perfect goodness. Whatever most closely resembles god's nature and characteristics is the most good. It doesn't really solve the issue but it is a quite interesting and I believe well accepted answer among christians.

askphilosophy,3dwyee,ccbeef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:56 2015 UTC,One option I just thought up is god does things because they are good. Because god is infinitely smart in the tradition sense of god he could reason out ethical dilemmas far better than we could. In fact he has reasoned a universal system of ethics that is flawless. He can reason things that are not clear to us with his massive inteligence. He then acts on that perfect morality. It doesn't matter that god is not the source of morality as by following his example we can still arrive at the correct answer to all moral issues. It makes no practical difference how where got there. Maybe humans are smart enough to make and understand and perfect code of ethics and god's guidance will be redundant or maybe not.  I think that is an interesting option. Maybe someone already wrote something similar

askphilosophy,3dwyee,FockSmulder,2,Wed Jul 22 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"What are you asking? i) Does God determine moral truths? ii) Does God know all moral truths and Does God always act morally?  If it's i) (as Tycho has interpreted) then there's no complete consensus, though the popular answer is ""no"" (usually followed by Euthyphro's dilemma as it's justification) the minority who disagree presumably have a counter-argument (I suspect William Lane Craig does, go to his website).  If it's ii), then you're asking: ""(assuming his existence) Even if God doesn't determine moral truths, does he know all of them and follows accordingly?"" then the answer is trivially yes, since God is by definition omniscient, morally perfect etc."
askphilosophy,3dwyee,3D-Mint,3,Mon Jul 20 08:23:42 2015 UTC,"I suspect William Lane Craig does   He does. Here's one of several podcasts he's done on the subject. A relevant extract:   For those that aren't familiar with it, the question is: does God will something because it is good, or is something good because God wills it? If the theist says that God wills something because it is good then the good is independent of God and, in fact then, moral values are not based in God. They are independent of him. On the other hand, if you say something is good because God wills it then that would seem to make what is good and evil arbitrary. God could have willed that hatred is good; then we would be morally obligated to hate one another, which seems crazy. Some moral values seem to be necessary, and therefore there would be no possible world in which hatred is good. So the claim is that this shows that morality cannot be based in God.  I think it is clearly a false dilemma because the alternatives are not of the form “A or not-A” which would be an inescapable dilemma. The alternatives are like “A or B.” In that case you can always add a third one, C, and escape the horns of the dilemma. I think in this case there is a third alternative which is to say that God wills something because he is good. That is to say, God himself is the paradigm of goodness, and his will reflects his character. God is by nature loving, kind, fair, impartial, generous, and so forth. Therefore, he could not have willed that, for example, hatred be good. That would be to contradict his very own nature.  So God's commands to us are not arbitrary, but neither are they based upon something independent of God. Rather, God himself is the paradigm of goodness."
askphilosophy,3dwyee,brynhildsen,2,Mon Jul 20 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"That is to say, God himself is the paradigm of goodness, and his will reflects his character.   Doesn't referring to God's character just reword the dilemma? Is something good because it is part of god's character or is it part of god's character because it is good?  Where did God's character come from? If God created his own character, then right and wrong are still based on some ideas that were not originally grounded in that character. If he didn't create his own character, then he essentially never had any input into what is good or bad, and all that is left for him to do, is to enforce it."

Recall that the standard argument for why it's problematic to take the first horn of the original Eutyphro dilemma is that, since there is no reason why God could not have commanded differently, the first horn seems to entail that our moral duties could have been radically different from what they actually are, to an absurd degree.  Obviously, an objection of this kind will only work against the first horn of your dilemma if God's nature could likewise have been radically different than it is. But by definition, it could not: God's nature is just that in virtue of which God is God, so if God's nature were different, it would not be God's nature at all. (I take it that we're using ""nature"" in a way that's at least roughly synonymous with ""essence."") It's quite true that this means that God in a sense has no ""say"" in what's good or bad, but it still lands us with the conclusion that morals are metaphysically grounded in God, which I take it is what the Eutyphro is meant to refute."
askphilosophy,3dwyee,brynhildsen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"so if God's nature were different, it would not be God's nature at all   It would not be our God's nature indeed. However, one can easily imagine various different possible worlds containing universes where the nature of the respective creator-god is different. In those worlds, someone would also be saying ""if God's nature were any different, it wouldn't be God's nature"".  We just happen to be in one of the possible worlds where God's nature includes rape on the list of bad things. But do we have any reason to claim that the creator-gods of those other worlds don't determine morality by their nature? Surely, in those other possible worlds, rape could be morally right, if good is merely determined by their god's nature?   It's quite true that this means that God in a sense has no ""say"" in what's good or bad, but it still lands us with the conclusion that morals are metaphysically grounded in God, which I take it is what the Eutyphro is meant to refute.   Then, if we can assume that his nature is correct (how would we even verify this?), ""God wills something because it is good"" as per the dilemma, which you acknowledge is something outside of his control. Since it's not a reasoned position, it's essentially the equivalent of following an instinct."

He was born with these traits and using godly logic deduced how every quality was good. He is not the ultimate source but his nature is a perfect copy of perfect morality. Why does matter if he is not the ultimate source. The point of ethics is to know right from wrong. It is irreverent how we get the answer as long as it is the correct answer.

Why is it inevitable that it changes? The only thing that I can think is that he's thinking it must change if the moment in time changes, because then A1 is a different moment in time than A2, thus making them different. But if this were the case, then they AREN'T in the same moment, which is the issue at hand here.   ""and existence itself is an uninterrupted process of transformation""   I'm not sure that's true either.  His whole objection regarding ""moment"" seems really dubious.

askphilosophy,3dvkpl,tempolevy,3,Mon Jul 20 01:09:14 2015 UTC,"I would agree that his argument is weird and misleading in some sense, though his purpose is less to talk about formal logic and more to present a case for strict dialectical materialism (""diamat"").  My understanding of his argument there, or interpretation, at least, is that there are near-unnoticiable, atomic-level differences that separate any object A from A', A' being the same object at some amount of time, infinitesimal or not, later. Thus, realistically, A != A' (and his idea is that accepting A=A implies this A=A').  So I'd say you're correct in a strictly abstract sense of logic, but he's *technically* correct in ""real world"" situations."

However, this isn't a mathematical statement its more of a statement about reality and appearances. So, it seems misleading for him to frame this as an objection to Aristotelian logic.

To be charitable to him, he seems to be suggesting that syllogistic reasoning must take time and place in a realistic human context, so that some object A will not be the same after a sufficient amount of time for reasoning to take place, or even for ""A=A"" to be thought or stated, so the first instance of ""A"" will refer to something qualitatively different than the second instance (assuming something like Heraclitean flux--that things are constantly changing--which seems close enough to the truth for macroscopic objects over periods of time perceivable by human brings). In that sense, A might not equal A.  Taken as an objection to the law of identity from within an abstract logical framework, the objection fails. It also seems pretty ridiculous, especially since we automatically assume the abstract stance when we consider things like the law of identity. But it makes a bit of sense as an objection to the framework itself, which Trotsky wants to dethrone as Reason par excellence for the sake of his dialectical reasoning."

Also Allison's KTI focuses on a lot of stuff that's just not of interest to someone working through the critique for the first or second time (like a silly anodyne theory of... I jest).   I would recommend a straight introduction. Buroker has a serviceable one out with Cambridge, and Dicker's Kant's Theory of Knowledge is also good (also just an intro). For the first-time reader who wants to take it to the next level, I would suggest starting with something like Van Cleve's Problems from Kant, which explores a number of philosophical episodes in the critique in bite-sized pieces, in an accessible way, and without being too preoccupied with pushing an agenda."

askphilosophy,3dvd1b,svartsomsilver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:12 2015 UTC,A conscious mind doesn't in any real sense move along with time. Consciousness is a product of the physical brain and exists only when the matter giving rise to it exists. To answer your question this means that at any given time all living brains have present minds.
askphilosophy,3dvd1b,svartsomsilver,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"There are perdurantist and endurantist theories about time. I am going to describe these in very broad strokes. According to perdurantists, things perdure over time. On this view, time is a fourth dimension and the past, the present, and the future all exist at all times. Things are temporally extended through this dimension, so that the three dimensional objects we perceive at any given moment are just parts of their true four dimensional shapes. (Some people like to refer to these parts as ""slices"" of a kind of ""time-worm"", extended through time.)  According to endurantists, on the other hand, things endure over time. There is some concept of a 'present', the past and the future doesn't exist in a real sense, and all things are wholly present in the now. For a lot of these theories, there would have to be a kind of absolute frame of reference for time, comparable to the ether, so they end up having problems explaining relativity.  For your example to work, we would have to assume perdurantism because the two subjective experiences would need to be temporally dislocated. But in assuming perdurantism you kind of negate the whole example, because we assume that the past, present and future exists at all times. If you talk with someone at time t you are really discussing with a temporal part of that person located at time t. And that part isn't experiencing some future date t+y. However, there does indeed exist a part of that person at t+y experiencing whatever's going on at that point in time. In fact, that is true of every part of their temporal career. So it makes no sense, on this view, to discuss subjective experiences as located in only one part of their temporal careers, advancing through them. There is, however, a lot of interesting stuff to be said on subjective perspective and time."

It would seem that the person I'm talking to is, in some way, experiencing our conversation. I think it still can work though. For example, I had a conversation with someone yesterday. I experienced it then. The person I talked to could just now feel like we are having that conversation, and nothing would change.  I also don't think this exactly requires determinism. Quantum mechanics shows that things can be truly random, which means things cannot be truly deterministic. However, it's still possible that the entire timeline has played out and our subjectivity is moving along it at x pace."
askphilosophy,3dvd1b,svartsomsilver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the example makes sense without some kind of deterministic notion.  1) Say that we were to have a discussion on Monday. Your subjective experience is one day ahead of mine, for whatever reason. So when you experience Tuesday, I experience Monday. Now, my Monday has to be the exact same as your Monday for this to make sense, which means I cannot change the events in any way. Maybe you, who is ""ahead"" in time, can choose freely, but whatever happened during your Monday, I cannot change. So determinism must be true for me, otherwise:  2) You can generalize this further. It really makes no sense to talk about people being spread across different points in time without a notion of determinism. Again, say that we meet on Monday, and you buy a plane ticket from me. A day later, your experience is now located at Tuesday, where you have boarded the plane. I, on the other hand, reach Monday for the first time. For some reason, like free will, a random quantum event, or whatever, I decide not to sell you the ticket. Now, your scenario, on Tuesday, is not possible anymore. You couldn't board the plane without that ticket. That timeline is erased, or whatever. What happens to your subjective experience? Did I just kill you, by not selling you the ticket and changing the timeline? What's going on? Did we split into different possible worlds? It all becomes very strange, indeed."
askphilosophy,3dvd1b,svartsomsilver,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. Let's take this to complete randomness to illustrate the point.   Say I have a pair of dice that produces perfectly random numbers. I know these don't exist, but pretend they do, and are as random and impossible to predict as quantum events. I throw these dice and record the numbers 10 times. This happens on July 30th, 2015.   July 30th is a point in time on a timeline. If we spoke to some beings that were capable of perceiving time as a dimension instead of a moment at a time, we could ask them if they could have predicted the rolls. They would say no, because they have no concept of predicting things. They could just look at that point on the timeline and tell you what the numbers are. You could even ask them before you rolled the dice, and they would tell you the same answer. The thing is, they are not answering before the dice are rolled. They are looking at time as a whole, and are able to look up a certain point.   If you've seen interstellar, then you may remember the part about 5 dimension beings and time. They said that these beings wouldn't perceive time as we do, but instead the past could be a canyon they could climb down into and the future a mountain they can climb up. This allows for time to exist as a dimension that is potentially traversable, without needing determinism at all."

I raise this observation because OP said one of the members of their university's department was a follower of Nietzsche. I don't think there really are many people who would claim to be such a thing in academia, for the same reasons you would claim there aren't Cartesians any more. Rather OP sees that professor's inclination toward existentialism or other concepts that Nietzsche discussed famously and equates that to a following of Nietzsche.   Contemporary philosophers are engaged with other contemporaries discussing concepts that have been discussed by others in the past. They do so in a manner that requires knowledge of the specific definitions of the stated concepts.   For example: if some one claims to be a Marxist they are not implying they are one of Marx's followers and hold identical beliefs, but rather stating their preference towards ideas that stem from Karl Marx, and his contemporaries' works, in which many new concepts have risen. In this instance terms like Marxist and an endless list of other terms used to discuss critiques of capitalism subsequently came into existence.   Marx never called his philosophy ""Marxism"", but other philosophers have since then.   Nietzsche never used the term ""existentialism"" in his philosophy, but is commonly cited as the founder of, or at least a prominent contributor to existentialism.   Descartes never used the term ""Cartesian"" in his philosophy, however terms like substance or mind/body dualism have risen.   Although Cartesian is a term used to describe many things in the context of radical doubt or dualism the product of philosophical discussions has determined that Decartes' philosophy as a whole has too many objections to be widely accepted."
askphilosophy,3dsp5m,Aristodemos94,16,Sun Jul 19 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"A very hot topic right now is grounding. Basically (at least, so the very simplistic historical story goes), where Quinean metaphysics asked ""what exists?"" Aristotelian metaphysics asked ""what relationships exist between existing things."" In particular, Aristotle was interested in a relationship of non-causal dependency between existing things that we might call grounding, or the in-virtue-of relationship. [Many contemporary metaphysicians cast grounding as a relationship between facts, rather than things.] As we move away from Quinean-style metaphysics, grounding has becoming very popular.  I'm not hugely up on the grounding literature, but the classic ""big three"" authors of grounding are Kit Fine, John Burgess, and Jonathan Schaffer, each of whom (particularly Fine) are well-known metaphysicians in general.   The paper that started it all is Rosen's ""Metaphysical dependence: grounding and reduction"". After this, you should read Fine's ""Guide to ground"" and Schaffer's ""On what grounds what"".  If you still need more readings, most major departments ran a grounding seminar a few years back, so just search ""grounding"" + ""syllabus"" + ""(name of fancy department)"" and you'll get one. For more recent work, just crawl the works cited of recent dissertations; there are a few dozen being written on grounding each year."

Some examples:  The fact that an action is morally wrong is grounded in its wrongmaking properties. For example, the fact that kicking puppies is morally wrong is grounded in the facts that this would cause needless suffering, and would instill bad dispositions in the puppies, and ...  The fact that I am conscious is grounded in a conjunction of physical facts (that certain neurons are firing, and arranged in certain ways, and ... whatever, I don't actually know any neuroscience).

In this particular case, God cannot be defined as omniscient and still not know something at the same time, therefore you would have at least assume is EITHER omniscient or he isn't. If he is indeed omniscient, then he necessarily knows he's not being deceived. If he is not omniscient, then he wouldn't be able to confirm if he is or not being conceived."

The point being that omniscience is a statement about knowledge, and knowledge should be justified. What is God's justification that it is omniscient? Since God cannot justify its omniscience to itself in an entirely satisfactory way without begging the question, God can be neither omniscient nor perfect."
askphilosophy,3dten4,ididnoteatyourcat,5,Sun Jul 19 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"God's knowledge is not discursive. He understands all things by direct intellectual comprehension of himself, and understands his effects (the world) through his understanding of himself and of what his actions will bring about.  How does God understand himself? He is perfectly simple and contains no parts. So his intellect and his being are the same thing considered under different aspects. Thus the object of his intellect - which is himself - is the same thing as his intellect. Now intellects understand by means of taking forms within themselves; so when I understand cats or trees, it is because I have abstracted the form of a cat or a tree from material things and possess it within my intellect. But the ""form"" which God's intellect would comprehend is identical to God's intellect (which is identical to God's being), so the thing he would be understanding is always present to him directly, without mediation. So his intellect is not potentially many things and contingently determined to understanding himself, which would mean his knowledge is an effect of some cause. His intellect is his knowledge of himself, which is his being. And that being is necessary and not causally dependent on anything else.  From Aquinas, Summa theologiae I q. 14 a. 2:   Since therefore God has nothing in Him of potentiality, but is pure act, His intellect and its object are altogether the same; so that He neither is without the intelligible species, as is the case with our intellect when it understands potentially; nor does the intelligible species differ from the substance of the divine intellect, as it differs in our intellect when it understands actually; but the intelligible species itself is the divine intellect itself, and thus God understands Himself through Himself.    A deeper metaphysical answer is that being a brain in a vat entails that one does not have total ontological primacy over everything else, since one's existence would be dependent on the brain or whatever apparatus is doing the thinking, which can be acted on by other things (e.g. the demon). But the best arguments for God's existence are the arguments of ""classical theism"" that show he is purely actual/the ultimate being/the ground of all being, which means he is unchanging and cannot stand in a relation of effect to some other cause. But then God can't be misled by something else, because that would require that other thing to be a cause of something about him."

Unlike God I'm not perfect, so maybe I just don't have the imagination, but if I imagine I find myself to be a perfect omniscient being, I can't make sense of having that kind of intrinsic knowledge about myself without such justification being tautological (ie I just know, man!)"
askphilosophy,3dten4,ididnoteatyourcat,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think there's a little potential for an analogy with our intellect's power of ""simple apprehension"". The Thomistic view of the intellect is that it is the place of forms, and our knowledge begins with sensory perception that leads to abstraction by which we understand the form inherent to each material object. So when we understand cats, we possess the essence or form of cats in our intellect. (Incidentally, this is why the intellect must be immaterial, because to possess e.g. the form of a cat in a piece of matter would just be for that matter to be a cat, but that's another issue.) From there, we can make judgments about cats and reason on the basis of those judgments by combining them. But stick with apprehension for now.  The reason human knowledge gives rise to these skeptical problems is that this process is mediated through so many perceptual organs and causes. The cat reflects light, that light hits our eyes, and our brain processes the data. There's so much causality going on that it can be weird when we start to trace it back to the original thing we're understanding. But one important aspect of this apprehension of an essence is that it doesn't really require ""justification"" in the sense of reasoning. Reason comes later. The schema is apprehension, then judgment, then reason which combines two or more judgments. Apprehension is ""justified"" not like an argument but in the sense that it conforms to the object, and that occurs (in us) because the object is given to us through the senses.  But suppose in order to eliminate some of the weirdness of human knowledge, we moved the object of the intellect causally ""closer"" to the intellect. Now it's mediated through fewer and fewer causes. Maybe somehow we can have direct access to forms. Maybe they've been put into our intellect by God. Something, I don't know. But the point is to imagine there being less and less between us and the object. Our knowledge of that object still isn't justified like an argument, because it's just apprehension, but it still conforms to the object by means of the object's presence to our intellect, so it's ""justified"" in that sense.  Now imagine moving it causally closer and closer until the intellect and the object of the intellect are actually the same thing. Then the access to the essence is always there because the intellect is identical to the essence being understood. It still doesn't require justification like an argument does because it is just the intellect (in a sense) taking into itself an essence. It's just that in this case, the intellect doesn't really ""take into itself"" an essence - it just is that essence, so the understanding always and necessarily conforms to that essence. A real distinction between them becomes impossible. It should be noted that I'm referring to ""the intellect"" = God's intellect, and ""the essence understood"" = God's essence, which are the same thing. (We must keep in mind that God knows everything through himself, not through the things. Since God is pure being and God knows himself fully, God knows being fully and so knows all the ways in which things can be, i.e. knows all the forms things can have.)  It's an analogy, of course. God's intellect is much different from ours, so it becomes dangerous to make analogies based on our intellect's powers (like that of apprehension that I used here). Ours depends on the data furnished by corporeal organs in a way that God's doesn't, etc. But I think it can shed some light.  This selection from the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1910 might make more sense out of what I am trying to say:   For the Schoolmen the intuitive act of intellectual knowledge is, by its nature, the most perfect act of knowledge, since it is an immediate apprehension of and contact with reality in its concrete existence, and our supreme reward in the supernatural order will consist in the intuitive apprehension of God by our intelligence: the beatific vision. But in our present conditions of earthly life, our knowledge must of necessity make use of concepts and reasoning. All our knowledge has its starting-point in the intuitive data of sense experience, but in order to penetrate the nature of these data, their laws and causes, we must have recourse to abstraction and discursive reasoning. It is also through those processes and through them alone that we can arrive at the notion of immaterial beings and of God himself (St. Thomas, ""Contra Gentes"", I, 12; ""Summa Theologica"" I:84-88, etc.) . Our mind has the intuition of primary principles (intellectus) but their application, in order to give us a scientific and philosophical knowledge of things, is subject to the laws of abstraction and successive reasoning (ratio, discursus, cf. I:58:3, II-II:49:5, ad 2um). Such a necessity is, as it were, a normal defect of human intelligence; it is the natural limit which determines the place of the human mind in the scale of intellectual beings."
askphilosophy,3dten4,Thomist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was helpful. I guess the problem I have is that I can imagine myself having a thought disorder in which I thought I was God and I felt that I had this ""direct access"" knowledge. How can one ever, no matter how perfect, be sure that this ""direct access"" is not a crafty illusion? God can ""have knowledge"" that it isn't an illusion, but then again, so can a Schizophrenic!"
askphilosophy,3dten4,ididnoteatyourcat,3,Sun Jul 19 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a strange thing to think about. I'd say that this is correlated with certain required theses about one's own nature, so that one could compare this method of knowledge with one's nature to see if it fits.  What I mean is that the reason God can perceive truth in this way is because he is ontologically ultimate. Accordingly, he (1) has no parts and (2) has no potentiality. Thus his intellect and knowledge must be identical (knowledge is just intellect in actuality - cf. Aristotle, On the Soul 3.8 - so no potentiality means the intellect is always in actuality and thus identical with knowledge), which must be identical to his being because of simplicity.  In our case, it should be easy to falsify this because we can see that our mind moves from the more known to the less known in reasoning about conclusions, so we don't have direct access to all the truth. Or we could reference the fact that we take in knowledge from outside - our knowledge of cats comes from cats outside of us, for example. If we think that our sense data are actually inside our minds and so we are just thinking about ourselves when we think about cats, we then see that our sense data change based on where we are looking, and change is incompatible with being ontologically ultimate. So we can know that this isn't true of us by finding some way to prove to ourselves that we change, depend on something else for our existence, or don't know everything, any one of which are at least clear in the evidence presented to us. If we don't respond to the evidence, then I guess we're just confused, but then our thought that we think the way God thinks is based on nothing at all, really.  But from typing this out I can see why it might be difficult to distinguish between actually having unmediated access to the truth, and being so confused that you think you do. I think a lot of it is due to not being able to effectively imagine what it would be like to understand things that directly, which would be seriously different from anything we have ever experienced. But I think the problem is principally about how to falsify the notion that one has unmediated access to the truth, rather than how to confirm it if it does exist. If the initial stipulation is that one really does have unmediated access to the truth, then it is clear enough just by virtue of that. And the metaphysical arguments of someone like Aquinas aimed at demonstrating God's existence attempt to show just that, so I don't think this effectively argues against God's omniscience. The difficulty arises when we have entities who don't have unmediated access to the truth (i.e. entities that are not God) who then have to figure out whether or not they do. But I think difficulties in that regard are due to our fallibility, rather than to any conceptual strangeness on the part of omniscience."

askphilosophy,3dten4,lksdjsdk,9,Sun Jul 19 12:57:32 2015 UTC,In this context we could probably phrase our meaning of 'omniscient' as 'having knowledge at least sufficient to negate any given skeptical (i.e. counterfactual) conclusion'. By definition an omnicient god would alredy have to have sufficient knowledge to negate anything that was false. In this case the skeptical question could never really be posed in the first place.

If he is not omniscient then the whole question is moot.  So it's not a question of how does god overcome the skeptical hypothesis, because by definition god is omniscient (that's what we mean when we say god), and therefore knows that there is no cause for skepticism.  edit: thought of a clearer way to put it (maybe).  ""I am omniscient"" is truth-apt, that is to say that it is certainly either true or false.

If you're being tricked by an illusion then you're not omniscient.    I suppose it also depends on what you consider to be God, and what you consider to be omniscient. You need to define these things so that people can actually answer your question.

Therefore, God cannot be deceived.  Edit to add: God presumably knows things from a different vantage point than we do.

Epicureanism, which usurped Cyrenaicism and survived for a lot longer than it, was also a form of hedonism (in that they took pleasure to be the highest good), although they much more resemble Stoics in saying that the best pleasure is imperturbability (ataraxia, compare with Stoicism's apatheia), which requires a more or less ascetic life. So I think Epicurus and the Epicureans might not be quite what you're looking for, even though others have mentioned them.

Which unfortunately means that if you live in the first world, relocating pretty substantive amounts of your funds to the people who can benefit from it the most.  *Although even major utilitarians often would point out that certain types of happiness like taking pleasure in virtue or love or intellectual pleasures is of a higher nature than plain happy sensation."

You could also read about the Roman Stoics (Epictetus, Seneca, etc.), and they sort of thought about achieving happiness and efficiency by decreasing errors in judgment, which to them was by removing emotional influence from judgment. That's probably not directly related, but it would be an interesting aside if you wanted to take it into consideration. You could also look at more modern stuff like Nietzsche, as /u/pimpbot mentioned. I think that Camus might be sort of relevant here if you wanted to take a look at Myth of Sisyphus because, if I recall correctly, he resolves absurdity as an origin of happiness for humankind. I'd urge you to read about thinkers who directly address the concept of happiness as well as thinkers who maybe dance around the concept but still provide some interesting considerations regarding it."

askphilosophy,3dtg3e,rejectednocomments,4,Sun Jul 19 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"A private language is one which only you can understand. It cannot be translated into a public language, like English or German. In order to assign a symbol meaning, we need some standard of determining when the symbol is applied correctly or not. But if the symbol is a symbol in a private language, there’s no standard for whether the symbol is applied correctly or not in a given case (the rule following argument is supposed to help support this). If there’s no standard for whether a symbol is correctly or incorrectly applied in a given case, then there’s no fact as to what the symbol means. Hence there can be no fact as to what symbols in a private language mean. So there cannot be a private language.  Aside: It’s sort of strange to talk about Wittgenstein’s arguments. In the Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein doesn’t really set about to give explicit arguments. He’s really trying to guide the reader with examples. Wittgenstein thinks most philosophical problems are due to misunderstanding how language works, and engaging with those arguments (say, by giving counterarguments) is to assume the same mistaken understanding of language that creates the problem in the first place. So instead of giving explicit arguments, Wittgenstein tries to draw the reader’s attention to certain facts about how language works in practice. Once we see this, philosophical problems should be dissolved as not problems at all."

This means it's automatic and so no interpretation is involved. Didn't he say ""there is a way of grasping a rule that is not interpretation."" So by that I think he means custom. But how does he fix the normativity requirement of meaning? I mean, okay you follow the community, but ought you to? Or in his view, is normativity not a requirement for meaning?"
askphilosophy,3dtg3e,pimpbot,2,Mon Jul 20 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"“For a large class of cases of the employment of the word ‘meaning’—though not for all—this way can be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the language” (PI 43).   There are standards of correct and incorrect usage of a term. Those are the standards of the public language. If I use the word 'computer' to indicate what I'm typing on right now, I'm using the word correctly, because that's how English speakers use that word.    I mean, okay you follow the community, but ought you to?   Wittgenstein thinks that in order to say anything meaningfully, you have to adhere to public standards of meaning. Of course I could use 'computer' to refer to a cup of coffee. But to do so meaningfully I have to perform some act which assigns 'computer' to cups of coffee, and this act must in principle be something someone else could understand. I can only meaningfully refer to a cup of coffee with the word 'computer' if someone else could in principle recognize that I was doing this. That's the sense in which the community creates a normative standard for meaning. I can't assign a meaning to my terms unless in principle someone else could recognize that I was giving that meaning to this term.  Ought we to do this? Wittgenstein would say we must if we are to mean anything at all.  Now, does this solve the paradox? Actually, this is an incredibly deep paradox. Kripke's verison concerns 'quus', defined:  x quus y = x+y if x, y < n, and 5 otherwise.  If all the math we've ever done so far has used numbers below n, how do we know whether we've been using plus or quus?  Now, Nelson Goodman gave a related paradox concerning induction. It seems that so long as we do not observe any A's which are not Bs, then every A we observe which is a B provides some evidence that all As are Bs. So, say all emeralds we have observed have been green. This provides some evidence that all emeralds are green. But consider the predicate 'grue' defined as  x is grue just in case: x is green and discovered before time t, or x is blue.  Suppose time t is in the future. Every emerald discovered so far is green and discovered before t, so every emerald discovered so far is grue. By our previous principle, it's reasonable for us to conclude that all emeralds are grue. But if all emeralds are grue, then some emeralds are blue.  So, we have equal reason to believe all emeralds are green, and that some emeralds are blue.   What is Wittgenstein's solution? I'm not sure. Part of it, though, is that our linguistic community creates certain standards for how words are used, and in order to speak meaningfully we have to follow those standards.   What is the real solution. Again, I'm not sure."

Lewis came up with strict implication, which he thought more properly tracked our ordinary thinking and talk about implications, as compared to the canonical material implication. (Aside from apparent paradoxes caused by the differences between our intuitive notion of implication and logical material implication, it's always a bit of a shock for Logic 101 students to here that a statement like ""if A, then B"" can be true when A and B are both false, for example.)  Lewis's formulation of strict implication was, where A strictly implies B, ""~◊(A Λ ~B)"", which translates to ""it is not possible that both A and not-B."" This means that, if A strictly implies B, it is impossible for B to be false when A is true, which perhaps feels more like our intuitive notion of implication than material implication. This is logically equivalent to the formulation of strict implication we use today, ""□(A→B)"", which was posted by /u/kabrutos.  Edit: I decided to derive the new formulation from the old for fun.

askphilosophy,3ds5ye,sauronthegr8,26,Sat Jul 18 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't have to go to philosophers; there are passages as early as in the Biblical books of Job and Jonah that outright question whether God had benevolent or malevolent intent with creation as far as humans are concerned. The entertaining of that dialogue is pretty strong evidence that like in Greek philosophy, some in the culture had already proposed that God had malevolent intent with creation. In theology, that question is usually called theodicy carries through the rest of what became the Christian Bible, and is usually tightly wrapped up with what was later called the Problem of Evil.   Who was the first to openly question the character of God?   First, you'd have to get to a point where a culture conceived of a Good to which even the powerful must strive, and then move back to humans accusing the gods of not living up to it. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh does seem to bring up the question of the unfairness of human life, but it largely blames the universe for it rather than creator gods; the gods are largely there to give demands to humans or be impressed by particular humans. A disappointment would largely be an odd thing to suggest, as there is no set relationship that the gods and humans are meant to establish. In the Germanic Sagas (and I'm simplifying to an extreme) the gods are largely free to follow their own whims or Fate, with no specific morality as to treating humans involved. In Homer, the gods are somewhat similar, but both they and humans are subservient to Fate, and if there is individual Good, it is in achievement of individual honour and glory rather than in fulfilling a set relationship. Mary Midgley pointed out that in this world, the whole existence of the gods might be so humans have someone to blame for their bad behaviour.  I'm guessing it would be only with the concepts of Divine Favour that you start to get theodicy in Greece, and that may begin with the Myth of Prometheus in Hesiod, where Zeus is, for whatever reason (which may well have a lot to do with Hesiod's tendency to moralize people's ethical roles in the world), first expected to care for those he created and doesn't. There's a complicated structure for morality in Aesychlus, but he also takes up the Prometheus story in Prometheus Bound, and his Orestes Trilogy somewhat ends with the gods implicated. Anyways, I find it kind of ridiculous to hear that God might be evil outside of a very specific ethical system; most times when people say it today, like Nietzsche they can say God failed at his own morality, but the next horrible question is ""Well, what is morality then?"" If you can't answer it (like Hesiod or Aeschylus absolutely can) it sort of invalidates the original assertion of God being evil in the first place."
askphilosophy,3ds5ye,LiterallyAnscombe,7,Sun Jul 19 00:45:36 2015 UTC,"While others have made good points, I would like to add a couple of points. While atheism is a widely accepted stance in philosophy, you're not going to find very many ""new atheist"" philosophers, and that the school of thought as a whole is seen as philosophical deprived (you can look into this a bit more, just seach for ""new atheist"" in the search bar), and many of the heads of new atheism (Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and the other horsemen of the non-apocalypse) are the butt of many jokes.  That being said, while the problen of evil is philosophical in nature, the attributes of God, namely, whether God is good or not is a problem for theologians (however, this does not mean that theology and philosophy do not intersect, they do on many occasions). And it is widely accepted that the Christian God is good.  If you are wishing to disprove God's existence, more percisely the existence of a good God, you can read into the problem of evil. I would suggest looking into William Rowe, who presents a rather strong argument, which I really like, called the evidential problem of evil. Although there is the logical problem of evil, one of which is presented by J.L. Mackie, but this is more or lessed solved by Alvin Plantinga in his Free Will Defense (different from a theodicy), some say in an unsatisfactory way (some even try to argue against it).  The previously mentioned philosophers are taken much more seriously than any new atheist, so if your introduction of philosophy of religion, and the problem of evil, consists solely of new atheists, I cannot recommend looking up Rowe, and the others, enough."
askphilosophy,3ds5ye,Aristodemos94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"No, I realize that. I don't consider Dawkins/Harris/etc to be philosophers, though I do tend to agree with many things they say and follow the ""movement"" for lack of a better word.  I've read many writings of the Early Church Fathers, some apologetics, and of course the Bible itself, so I'm familiar with The Problem of Evil. It's just that I've noticed some interesting shifts in even the popular notion of God's ""goodness"".  For example, I remember watching a sketch comedy show a while back where a character was warning Eve against eating from the Tree of Good and Evil. The character explicitly tells her that God is trying to trick her, instead of the Snake or Satan. It struck me as odd because even though I've seen this idea in atheist circles of God having some blame in the matter, I'd never seen it portrayed in something like this. Typically in the past, God placing the Tree in the Garden in the first place isn't seen to be the cause of the Fall (and would border on blasphemy to suggest), but man's fault for disobeying him, even though Eve nor Adam had any concept of consequences of right or wrong.  I think there could be some parallels to the concept of the ""Glorious Fall"" explored by some Medieval theologians, a plan to bring He and man closer, and thus eventually bring about the birth and death of Christ, but by its nature the Glorious Fall is considered ""good"".  I guess if I were trying to prove anything it would be that God bares blame for the situation the world is in, having designed man to fail. However, He accepts none of this blame and shifts it solely to His creations, intentionally limited in their few years and ability to understand, not to mention His absolute refusal to directly reveal Himself. Most people who ever lived or ever will live are in a position where there isn't enough evidence to believe or having been born in the wrong time or place (again by His design), condemned to eternal torture in Hell, an act that cancels out any notion of ""goodness"" to His character.

It's not about saying that every decision made by every individual at every time in her life has to have some kind of return on investment.  So even in its ""purest form"", it's not clear to me that there's anything anti-capitalistic about individuals freely choosing to donate to charities, churches, schools, hospitals, scientific research, etc.   Regarding point 2: this seems to me to be a description of ""consumerism"" rather than ""capitalism"".

askphilosophy,3dr5uq,sunsetsweremocked-,0,Sun Jul 19 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"Catholic here.  Tithing is not counter to capitalistic ideas, because capitalism is a system that seeks to optimize personal liberty (not saying that this is the case). There is nothing at all inherent to capitalism that would imply you cannot do with your money what you see fit.   Coveting your neighbor exists in both capitalist and communistic societies, it isn't predicated on either. In communist societies you might covet someone who has more attractive ingrained features, for example. Indeed, one of the chief mortal sins is coveting the goodness of your neighbor. You are conflating capitalism with consumerism and the two are not interchangeable. Also, there is nothing within capitalism that prevents you from living communally. In the United States version of capitalism there are thousands of communes, and more than one million Anabaptist adherents on top of that who live communally within a capitalist system.  The entire goal of capitalism is not to make yourself wealthy. Capitalism says little about goals. It was originally espoused in the belief that it allows the most liberty. Also, while Christ said that the meek shall inherit the Earth, he also said things that many would consider capitalist. For one, Christ was asked by a man to tell the man's brother to split his inheritance, and Christ said that he was not appointed master over him. So Christ was clearly not anti-capitalist, clearly not communist, and clearly delineates himself from the political fold. But at another point, in the Parable of the Talents, Christ uses the example of a wealthy landowner with servants to present a moral point. One might argue that he is implicitly allowing such an arrangement given that he uses it to endorse a political view. In the parable, a rich man gives his three servants a coin each. One of the men buries the coin in the ground, another man utilizes the coin to buy goods, but the last man invested the coin with a financier. Christ says that, spiritually, we should be like the last man who invests a coin with a financier and waits patiently for his return. If Christ was against investments, why would he praise the spiritual equivalent of investments?   Now, with all of this said, Catholics do not find capitalism to be the optimal system. There's a Catholic-founded political philosophy called ""distributism"" that seeks an equilibrium between personal liberty and the necessity of a minimum of care for those who have nothing."
askphilosophy,3dr5uq,illStudyTomorrow,0,Sat Jul 18 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"The welfare state has crowded out tithing and other charitable contributions.  Depending on your perspective, this might be a good or bad thing, but it is so.  Areas with lower taxes have higher rates of charitable giving.  Capitalism is mostly just the absence of violent coercion by the government or others, it does not say anything about how people choose to spend their profits. I'd argue that coveting is more akin to what we'd call envy today.  Envy is not compatible with capitalism. Envious people hate that others have more than them, feel that the others didn't deserve it, and often seek to confiscate wealth (e.g. via high taxes). When moderated, the impulse that you describe is ambition and striving.  But ultimately, capitalism punishes those who are greedy and borrow more than they can afford to. I think you need to take that passage in context.  Christ offered a place in his kingdom to all who believe in him, regardless of their place in this world.  Capitalism has winners and losers, but which camp you fall in does not determine your moral worth.  The United States, for example, was founded on very capitalist AND anti-aristocratic impulses.  As a society of free equals each pursuing their own livelihoods.  No one is required to show deference to another.   A couple of other passages to think about too: ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.""   ""My kingdom is not of this world"""
askphilosophy,3dr5uq,Marco13185,0,Sat Jul 18 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"The New Testament assumes a capital-ish, if not capitalist world.  The parables of Christ are full of stories revolving around employers and employees (landowners and renters, bosses and servants, kings and subjects, wealthy patrons and the poor).  The parables discuss investing, trade, loans and banking, labor relations, business relationships, white-collar fraud, inheritance, slacking off on the job, extremes of wealth and poverty.  The parables are not ABOUT socio-economic theory, but the parables use these darn-close-to-modern-capitalist economic situations and relationships to talk about ""the Kingdom of God"".  Often the parables do carry a critique of the injustices in the economic world of Ancient Rome, but the main purpose of the parable is to talk about the Gospel of Christ.    In the ancient world, a healthy economy meant that fewer people starved, in our days, an ever growing economy means that we rush ever faster to depleting our natural resources.    The commandment ""You shall not covet"" is an Old Testament commandment reflecting the realities of nomadic clans living in close proximity with each other where the few private goods could easily cause jealousy.  In our day, this tenth commandment (the runt of the litter) is likely to become the commandment that roared.  I could see a real return to this commandment for the sake of the survival of the planet.  We aren't there yet, but, see what happens if crops fail for two or three years in a row.  When this day comes, modern capitalism will have to do some deep soul-searching.  The New Testament gives a vision of a society that collectively learns to share, seeks justice, including economic justice for all.  However, it does not give a plan or economic theory on how to implement this society.  So, Christianity holds up values and goals, but is neutral on how a society accomplishes this."

For one, what we call colour is an effect of objects that refract certain wavelengths of light energy. The object does not inherently have colour at all, but creates colours by manipulating certain parts of light.   However, the basis for a common reason for why most humans largely perceive colours the same way is a big question in 20th century philosophy. Like a lot of things, there is a somewhat similar experience out there, but it's not dependent on us, but we all perceive the effect of that experience in largely the same way. It's the same with heat. If I were to step into a cold room with a few others, we could probably agree the room is cold, even though our feeling of cold is based on our first having a body temperature above the room, rather than it being a Law of the Universe that 10 degrees Celsius is ""cold"" (in many lab experiments, and conditions in the world, 10 degree Celsius material could be comparatively hot compared to the rest of the system). That's probably what Russell means here by the ""real."""
askphilosophy,3dtf1j,LiterallyAnscombe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Philosophy of color is a surprisingly fraught subject, but here's my take on it.  There is something about the object that, when light travels from it to our eyes, causes the light to be at a certain range of wavelengths (or groups of ranges of wavelengths), which hits our retinas and eventually causes a colored experience.  (1) The object doesn't inherently have a color because there would be no property of being-some-color without a subject having a colored experience of the table, and the character of that experience depends on the lighting conditions and the nervous system of the subject and not just the table itself. This is what he means by it being a sort of relation between the object and subject. (Some philosophers disagree with this and identify color as whatever it is about the object that causes us to see it as a certain color in normal conditions. You might be noticing the weirdness of attributing a quality of our experience of the table to the table itself, and that's one of the big issues in philosophy of color.)  (2) The color is not entirely dependent on us because it's also determined in part by the nature of the table itself and the room's lighting conditions. If there were no light, or no table, or a differently colored table, we would have a different experience.  (3) We perceive the table via the light. The light has wavelengths that determine which cones will activate when struck, so you might say it has color in a sense, but that light is what causes you to have the colored experience of the table, which is what makes the table colored in a different sense. There is nothing contradictory about the table being brown and the light from the table having the right wavelengths to make us see brown."

You often hear in the popular media, especially on the topic of ""sin taxes,"" that dangerous and unhealthy behaviors put a strain on the medical system, but empirical studies tend to show the opposite (e.g. this one, focusing specifically on smoking). This isn't as unintuitive of a conclusion as it may first appear, given that healthy people tend to live longer and rack up some very expensive hospital bills for end-of-life care.   This is why I argue we should stop taxing cigarettes and start taxing gym memberships. Healthy folks cannot expect the rest of us to subsidize their longevity, after all. /s  Anyways, I don't know any studies about motorcycle helmets but I imagine it likely you'd find similar results. If you crack your head open at 30 and spill your brains out all over the pavement you'll have saved the system potentially 60 year of health care costs incurred at your behest, the most expensive of which tend to come in the elderly years."
askphilosophy,3drvf6,AnxiousReginald,5,Sun Jul 19 01:06:23 2015 UTC,"So there are two issues here that jump out right away.  First, it's not obvious that the right way to understand the relation these social institutions have to the individual as being the merely negative one where they are better when they do not involve themselves with the individual's behavior.  It could be, to the contrary, that they have a positive role by being the institutions through which we communally pursue the good life, so that these particular laws are part of our support of what is good for our community.  Second, it's not obvious that these sorts of issues have no effect on other people.  Health care is often subsidized socially, so that even people who merely harm themselves through negligent behavior often end up costing everyone else through health care costs; society at large often has a considerable investment in the individual through things like subsidization of education, which implies likewise a considerable cost if the person's life is cut short or productivity impaired through negligence; and the productivity of a person is generally a good for society which is lost in those cases.  So that a case can generally be made for it costing society to have someone injured, ill, or killed through negligence--rather than it being something which effects no one but the one individual involved.  So, to make your case against these sorts of laws, I think these are two significant issues you would have to tackle."

In countries where public health insurance exists (which usually end up paying for themselves with economic stimulus and the reduction of work time loss due to sickness) I can imagine things like motorcycle helmets are a logical extension of that understanding of society; we pay for each others' care, but at the same time are obligated to higher precautions. I'm not sure I see a rationale outside of that except for the sake of decreased liability for insurance companies.  The other objection could be that not everybody can be sat down to hear a full lecture of the risks of doing a particular activity and there's not legal mechanism for checking whether they've fully understood them outside of signing a liability form every time they do that activity (or if you're a police officer, being able to check to see that person has signed said liability every time they do that activity)."

It's, to put it simply, down to the size of the brain relative to bodily mass and physical size, the amount of neurons in the brain, the interactions between them, and the ways in which they are connected.   Human socialisation is worlds above animal proto-socialisation. Non human Animals just do not have the hardware to socialise in such a developed way as Homo sapiens.to illustrate this, I'll use this example. An Atari can be similar to a ps4 in many ways (they both have a control, display interactive games etc), but one is clearly capable of far more than the other ever could be.   This is the case with human intelligence (including our society) compared to non humans."
askphilosophy,3dsr1w,AccidentOfBirth,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:41:33 2015 UTC,"What makes us most distinct from other species is what I call ""morphological volatility"". This is just a measure, not a unique quality. Vastly more than any other species, we create change. Our ability to transform the environment of earth, to willfully introduce genetic changes into our bodies that would take a very long time naturally, our ability to effect small changes beyond the scope of our planet, reflect a capacity to create variations that are amazingly beyond the scope of any other species. The living patterns of all species introduce variations, but we are the true variant freaks of all nature. It amazes me that recently, the coldest place in all the universe was not deep space, it was in a place where humans commonly seek to express our capacity to create variations, a human laboratory. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-coldest-place-in-the-universe-8121922/  Because we live in a biological environment that is is patterned to increase in complexity, our superior morphological volatility naturally gives us the ability to generate more complex forms (such as our society). But a complex social structure is just an artifact of this.   When thinking about this human difference, I ask myself what is the cause behind our morphological volatility. Below are a few candidate items that, if not actual causes, are strongly correlated:   Our capacity to think about the future Our ability to think about thinking about thinking Our ability to allow thought to override our most basic instincts   To bend this post around to philosophy, I think of the question, ""What does it mean to be human?"". Currently, all my thought about this question is about the relationship between repetition and variation, complexity and meaning. Whatever it means to be human, it must involve our capacity to create new variations.   I did some writing on this from my perspective as a Socratic philosopher. For me, the purpose of philosophy is to learn to live well. Relative to variations (change), it is not just about creating variations, but also about the passive form of our relationship to variation. From my essay on this idea:  ""Facing change is a fundamental constant of life and the great universal truth of all humanity. Whatever the human condition is, the most persistent and immensely saturating truth of our human being is the truth of facing change. In any definition of what it means to live well, that definition must also tell us something about what it means to face change well."" (From: F.O.E. Part III: The Fundamentals of the Human Condition)  The uniqueness of the human condition, put in its most fundamental terms, is that we are vastly more powerful than any other species in our capacities to face and create change. The complexity of society is just one manifestation of this uniqueness."
